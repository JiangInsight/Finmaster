                        "content": "We start by noting that most of the ratios use numbers taken from the ending (“2024-01-31”) amounts. In our case, note that the balance sheet gives the “total current liabilities” and “total current assets” and that the income statement “Cost of Goods Sold” (COGS) is used to find the inventory turnover. Also, the operating cash flow number and current liabilities are employed for the first two ratios. In the example, the same definition was used for both Operating Cash Flow Ratio and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio.\n\nStep‐by‐step calculations:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio \n  = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) ÷ (Total Current Liabilities)\n  = (–5,714,107.45) ÷ (2,736,025.72)\n  ≈ –2.0889 → –2.09\n\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio \n  = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) ÷ (Total Current Liabilities)\n  = (–5,714,107.45) ÷ (2,736,025.72)\n  ≈ –2.09\n\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio \nSince the beginning inventory is zero, we use the average (which is half of the ending inventory). Thus:\n  = COGS ÷ (Average Inventory)\n  = COGS ÷ (Ending Inventory ÷ 2)\n  = (2 × COGS) ÷ (Ending Inventory)\n  = (2 × 5,580,000.00) ÷ 3,900,000.00\n  = 11,160,000.00 ÷ 3,900,000.00\n  ≈ 2.8615 → 2.86\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio \nWe use total current liabilities as “debt” and Total Owner’s Equity from the balance sheet:\n  = (Total Current Liabilities) ÷ (Total Owner’s Equity)\n  = 2,736,025.72 ÷ 11,330,150.23\n  ≈ 0.2413 → 0.24\n\n5. Quick Ratio \nQuick Ratio excludes the inventory from current assets:\n  = (Total Current Assets – Inventory) ÷ (Total Current Liabilities)\n  = (7,664,945.72 – 3,900,000.00) ÷ 2,736,025.72\n  = 3,764,945.72 ÷ 2,736,025.72\n  ≈ 1.3760 → 1.38\n\n6. Current Ratio \n  = (Total Current Assets) ÷ (Total Current Liabilities)\n  = 7,664,945.72 ÷ 2,736,025.72\n  ≈ 2.8029 → 2.80\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-2.09\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-2.09\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"2.86\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.24\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.38\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"2.80\"\n  }\n}",
