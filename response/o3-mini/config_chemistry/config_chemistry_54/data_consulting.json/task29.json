                        "content": "We start by choosing the relevant items from the provided statements and then use the following formulas:\n\n1. Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity  \n • From the balance sheet, Total Liabilities is given by Total Current Liabilities = 2,736,025.72 and Total Owner's Equity = 11,330,150.23.  \n • Calculation: 2,736,025.72 / 11,330,150.23 ≈ 0.2413 → ≈0.24\n\n2. Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%  \n • From the income statement, Net Profit = –1,669,849.77 and Total Revenue = 6,920,513.79.  \n • Calculation: (–1,669,849.77 / 6,920,513.79) × 100% ≈ –24.13%\n\n3. Return on Assets (ROA) = (Net Profit / Total Assets) × 100%  \n • From the balance sheet, Total Assets = 14,066,175.95.  \n • Calculation: (–1,669,849.77 / 14,066,175.95) × 100% ≈ –11.87%\n\n4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n • Accounts Receivable at the beginning is 0 and at the end is 2,923,459.19, so the average is (0 + 2,923,459.19) / 2 = 1,461,729.595.  \n • Calculation: 6,920,513.79 / 1,461,729.595 ≈ 4.73\n\nThus, our final answers in the required JSON format are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.24\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"-24.13%\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"-11.87%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"4.73\"\n  }\n}",
