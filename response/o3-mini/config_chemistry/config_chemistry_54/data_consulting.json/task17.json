Here, debt is considered as the sum of the current liabilities given by Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable:  \n• Accounts Payable = 2,390,000.00  \n• Taxes Payable = 346,025.72  \n• Total Debt (Current Liabilities) = 2,390,000.00 + 346,025.72 = 2,736,025.72\n\nStep 3: Compute the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio using:  \n  Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = (Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Debt)  \n  = –5,714,107.45 / 2,736,025.72  \n  ≈ –2.088, which rounds to –2.09\n\nThus, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is –2.09.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is:\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-2.09\"}\n}",
