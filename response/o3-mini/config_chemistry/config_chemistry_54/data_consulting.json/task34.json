                        "content": "We can calculate the requested ratios step‐by‐step. Note that when needed we use the end-of‐period figures (or the averages when required).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n• From the cash flow statement, the net cash flow from operating activities is –5,714,107.45.\n• From the balance sheet, the end number for Total Current Liabilities is 2,736,025.72.\n• Ratio = (Operating Cash Flow) / (Current Liabilities) \n    = –5,714,107.45 / 2,736,025.72 \n    ≈ –2.09\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n• Total Liabilities are the “Total Current Liabilities”. (There are no non-current liabilities provided.) So use 2,736,025.72.\n• Total Owner’s Equity at period end is 11,330,150.23.\n• Ratio = (Total Liabilities) / (Total Owner’s Equity) \n    = 2,736,025.72 / 11,330,150.23 \n    ≈ 0.24\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n• Total Revenue for the period is 6,920,513.79 (from the income statement).\n• To compute average total assets:\n  Beginning Total Assets (2023-12-31) = 13,000,000.00\n  Ending Total Assets (2024-01-31) = 14,066,175.95\n  Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 14,066,175.95) / 2 \n              = 27,066,175.95 / 2 \n              ≈ 13,533,087.98\n• Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Total Assets \n     = 6,920,513.79 / 13,533,087.98 \n     ≈ 0.51\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Quick Ratio\n\nThe Quick Ratio is defined as (Quick Assets) / (Current Liabilities) where “Quick Assets” usually include cash and cash equivalents, short-term receivables (and other receivables) but exclude inventory.\n\n• Cash & cash equivalents from the balance sheet:\n  Cash on Hand = 735,892.55\n  Bank Deposits = 103,027.27\n  Interest Receivable = 2,566.71\n  Accounts Receivable = 2,923,459.19\n  Sum of Quick Assets = 735,892.55 + 103,027.27 + 2,566.71 + 2,923,459.19\n                  = 3,764,945.72\n• Current Liabilities = 2,736,025.72\n• Ratio = 3,764,945.72 / 2,736,025.72 ≈ 1.38\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nThis ratio is often defined the same as (Operating Cash Flow) / (Current Liabilities). Therefore, it is the same number as calculated in Step 1.\n\n• Ratio = –5,714,107.45 / 2,736,025.72 ≈ –2.09\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n\nROE is calculated as Net Profit divided by average owner’s equity.\n\n• Net Profit from the income statement is –1,669,849.77.\n• Owner’s Equity levels:\n  Beginning Owner’s Equity (2023-12-31) = 13,000,000.00 \n  Ending Owner’s Equity (2024-01-31) = 11,330,150.23\n  Average Owner’s Equity = (13,000,000.00 + 11,330,150.23) / 2 \n          = 24,330,150.23 / 2 \n          ≈ 12,165,075.12\n• ROE = (Net Profit) / (Average Owner’s Equity)\n     = –1,669,849.77 / 12,165,075.12 \n     ≈ –0.1373, or –13.73%\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\nThis ratio is usually taken as “Total Revenue” divided by “Average Accounts Receivable”. Assuming sales are on credit:\n\n• Accounts Receivable at beginning (2023-12-31) = 0.00 \n• Accounts Receivable at end (2024-01-31) = 2,923,459.19\n• Average Accounts Receivable = (0.00 + 2,923,459.19) / 2 ≈ 1,461,729.60\n• Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable \n     = 6,920,513.79 / 1,461,729.60 \n     ≈ 4.73\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThus, our final answers are:\n\n{\n  \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-2.09\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.24\",\n  \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.51\",\n  \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.38\",\n  \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-2.09\",\n  \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"-13.73%\",\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"4.73\"\n}\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-2.09\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.24\", \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.51\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.38\", \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-2.09\", \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"-13.73%\", \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"4.73\"}}",
