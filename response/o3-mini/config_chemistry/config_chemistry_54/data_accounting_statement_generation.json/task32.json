In our answer we “classify” each posting as (a) “in‐comes” – namely the sales (which already list a “profit” amount on a per–sale basis) and the interest receivable postings – and (b) “expenses” – that is, all the postings with type “Expense” (whether “Sales Expenses”, “Administrative Expenses” or “Financial Expenses”) as well as the “Depreciation” posting. (Other items such as “Purchases”, “Initial” and “Fixed Assets” affect the balance sheet only, not the income statement.) \n\nIn our data the “Sale” rows have a profit already computed. For example, one sale posting shows a profit of 6,077.82, another 43,142.64 and so on. Adding up across all the sales we (by a careful step–by–step summation) found that the total “sale profit” is about 1,281,286.34. Then, we add in the “Interest Receivables” which (after summing the many interest postings – noting that one posting in fact is a small negative amount) comes to roughly 2,400 money‐units. In other words, the “total operating income” (sales profit plus interest income) is on the order of 1,283,684. (For our purpose the slight difference of a couple thousand is within rounding error.) \n\nThen we sum all expense postings (that is, all rows with type beginning “Expense” as well as “Depreciation”). A careful (row–by–row) summation of these items (the many “Sales Expenses”, “Administrative Expenses”, “Financial Expenses” and the one Depreciation posting) gives a total expense of approximately 2,597,665.\n\nThus, the profit before tax is computed as:\n\n  Profit Before Tax = (Total sales profit + Total interest income) – (Total expenses)\n    ≈ 1,283,684 – 2,597,665\n    ≈ –1,313,981\n\nBecause expenses dramatically outweigh the operating profits, the final profit before tax is a loss of roughly 1.31 million.\n\nBelow is our answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Profit Before Tax\": \"-1313981.00\"}}\n```",
