                        "content": "We need to isolate only those records that affect “property, plant and equipment” (non‐current assets). In our dataset the only rows that affect the fixed assets value are:\n\n1. The beginning “Initial” record for Fixed Assets. (In our “Initial20231231001” record the row with “Fixed Assets” has an amount of 5,000,000.00.)\n\n2. Any additional purchases of non‐current assets. In our file these come as rows with type \"FixedAsset20231231001\" (i.e. “Fixed Assets Purchase”). We found four such records:\n  a. A row for “Fixed Assets Purchase” (asset_name “Storage Facilities4”) with an amount of 230,120.87.\n  b. A row for “Fixed Assets Purchase” (asset_name “Chemical Production Line5”) with an amount of 478,737.63.\n  c. A row for “Fixed Assets Purchase” (asset_name “Processing Equipment6”) with an amount of 351,585.30.\n  d. A row for “Fixed Assets Purchase” (asset_name “Processing Equipment7”) with an amount of 386,528.93.\n\n3. Depreciation also reduces the book‐value of fixed assets – there is one “Depreciation20240101001” record with an amount of 45,742.50.\n\nStep‐by‐step calculation:\n\nA. Initial Non‐current Assets (from the “Initial” record):\n  Initial = 5,000,000.00\n\nB. Total Additions =\n  230,120.87 + 478,737.63 + 351,585.30 + 386,528.93 \n  = 230,120.87 + 478,737.63 = 708,858.50  \n    708,858.50 + 351,585.30 = 1,060,443.80  \n    1,060,443.80 + 386,528.93 = 1,446,972.73\n\nC. Total depreciation to subtract = 45,742.50\n\nD. Ending Non‐current Assets =\n  Initial + Additions – Depreciation\n  = 5,000,000.00 + 1,446,972.73 – 45,742.50\n  = 6,446,972.73 – 45,742.50\n  = 6,401,230.23\n\nSo, the final answers (formatted with two decimals) are:\n\n• Total Non‐current Assets Initial Value: 5000000.00  \n• Total Non‐current Assets End Value: 6401230.23\n\nThus, the JSON solution output is:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"6401230.23\"\n  }\n}\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThis completes the required calculation.",
