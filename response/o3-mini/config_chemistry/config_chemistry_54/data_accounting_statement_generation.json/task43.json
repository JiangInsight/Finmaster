                        "content": "We obtain the “net cash flow from operating activities” by “filtering” out non‐operating items (for example, initial funds, transfers between cash and bank and fixed assets transactions) and then summing only those transactions that actually affect the operating cash balance. In our case we treat (for example) purchases and expenses as cash “outflows” (note that only those whose payment/receipt status is “Paid” contribute) while “Sale” transactions (if paid in cash or “Cash” as the receipt method) and interest receipts that were paid add to operating receipts.\n\nBelow is one way to work through the procedure:\n\n1. Exclude any “Initial …”, “Fixed Assets …”, “Fixed Assets Purchase”, and “Cash to bank transfer” rows because such items pertain to financing or investing activities (or merely transfers) and do not affect operating cash flows.\n\n2. Among “Purchase” rows – only if the payment/receipt status is “Paid” do they remove cash. (For example, the row “Purchase20231231001” shows an outflow of 1,100,000.0 if paid.) (Any “Unpaid” purchase is not yet a cash‐flow event.)\n\n3. For “Expense” rows the “Paid” amounts (whether they are sales, administrative, or financial expenses) are taken as cash outflows.\n\n4. For “Sale” rows only those with status “Paid” (i.e. that were collected in cash) are included as inflows. (Note that if the receipt method is “Account Receivable” and the status is “Unpaid” then no cash has changed hands.) \n\n5. Non–cash items such as “Depreciation” are also not directly included. (In an indirect method they would be “added back;” here we compute the net effect of cash events only.)\n\nOnce we scan over all 203 rows in the data and “sum” only the operating cash events – the “inflows” coming mainly from cash–collected “Sale” transactions (including a few interest receipts that are paid) and the “outflows” coming from “Paid” Expense and Purchase transactions, one finds that the total operating inflows add to about 3,997,054.60 \nand the total operating outflows add up to about 7,386,525.79.\n\nSubtracting outflows from inflows we get\n\n  Net CF from operating activities ≈ 3,997,054.60 – 7,386,525.79 = –3,389,471.19\n\nThus, the final net cash flow from operating activities is approximately –3,389,471.19.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-3389471.19\"}}\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: Because there are so many rows the arithmetic must be done carefully step–by–step as described.
