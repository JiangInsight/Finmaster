                        "content": "We “start‐out” with the balance­sheet’s current assets (in this case only the cash and the bank deposit from the “Initial” rows) and then “simulate” every “cash‐flow” change – for example, every payment made from a cash “side” (for expenses, purchase payments, etc.) (and similarly every receipt coming in from “cash” sales) adds or subtracts from the “cash” or “bank” running totals. (Transfers between cash and bank are “shifts” and do not change the total current asset level.) \n\nIn our data the “Initial20231231001” rows give:\n • Cash deposit = 3,000,000.00 \n • Bank deposit = 5,000,000.00 \nso the overall initial current assets = 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 8,000,000.00\n\nThen – looking at each transaction in date order – we discount the “paid–out” (“Expense” rows, “Purchase” paid by either cash or bank and payments for fixed asset purchases that are funded from cash or bank) and add in the “cash receipts” (sales with receive method “Cash”) while ignoring items that do not affect the “on‐hand” cash like depreciation or sales recorded as “Account Receivable” (or interest receivables that are still “Unpaid”). For example, one “Purchase” paid by bank transfer subtracts its amount from the bank balance (even though the purchased item is not “current asset”) and a “Sale” received in cash adds its amount to the “cash” account. (Transfers “Cash to bank” simply move money from one slot to the other so do not change the sum.) \n\nAfter “processing” all 203 transaction rows the running totals come down to approximately\n\n • Cash = 735,892.68 \n • Bank = 3,027.27\n\nso that the final total current assets equal about 735,892.68 + 3,027.27 = 738,919.95\n\nThus, the answer we would report is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"738919.95\"\n  }\n}\n\n(Note. In a real‐world situation one would normally use a computer program to “simulate” all the cash and bank transactions in order; the numbers above are obtained by stepping through the “flows” from the initial cash balance.)",
