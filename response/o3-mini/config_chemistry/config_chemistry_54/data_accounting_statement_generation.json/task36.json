                        "content": "We can “back‐calculate” the net profit by noting that in our records the sale transactions already “produce” a profit (which is the difference between (after–tax) revenue and cost) while the various expense entries – including operating expenses and depreciation – must then be “deducted” from that gross margin. (Purchases and fixed–asset acquisitions are “balance–sheet” items and do not affect the profit calculated on the income statement.) \n\nIn this case one acceptable approach is to:\n\n1. Add together (only) the profit figures listed in the sale transactions. (For example, if one sale row shows a “profit” value of 6077.82 and another 43142.64, etc.) In our table those “sale” rows – whose “profit” column is already the “sale margin” – add to a total of roughly 1,333,889.92.\n\n2. Next add up all expense transactions (the “Expense”–typed rows plus the Depreciation entry). In our table the sum of those expenses (when you add the amounts for administrative, sales, financial expenses and depreciation) comes to roughly 2,661,803.77.\n\n3. Then, subtract (2) from (1) to obtain the net profit:\n  Net Profit = (total sales “profit”) – (total expense amounts)\n        ≈ 1,333,889.92 – 2,661,803.77 \n        ≈ –1,327,913.85\n\n(There are also some very small “interest receivable” amounts – some even negative – but these either belong in a separate “non–operating” section or are already “netted” by our sale–profit computation. In our treatment here we include only the sale–profit against our operating expenses.)\n\nThus the “final net profit item” that would appear on the cash flow statement in our example is about –1,327,913.85.\n\nWe now report the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n────────────────────────────\nBelow is the answer in the requested json format:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"-1327913.85\"}}",
