                        "content": "We need to “net‐up” from the list only those transactions that reduce profit – that is, all expense‐side items. (Purchases, deposits, fixed‐asset related transactions, transfers and sales are not expense items.) In the given table the items with “Expense…” in the type (including “Sales Expenses”, “Administrative Expenses”, “Financial Expenses”) and “Depreciation” should be added. (We ignore “Interest Receivables” even though they appear with “Interest” because those are not “expense” items in the income statement.) \n\nBelow is one way to proceed:\n\n1. Look at each row and, if its type begins with “Expense” or is “Depreciation”, add its “amount” value.\n2. For example – in the short sample we would add amounts like 44,699.56 (Sales Expenses at 2024‑01‑01), 8,009.30 (Administrative Expenses), 49,449.08 (another Sales Expenses), plus the depreciation 45,742.50, etc. (Similarly, include every expense row in the long table.)\n\nAfter carefully summing (by grouping several rows at a time to reduce arithmetic errors) the amounts from all such rows the total expense has been found to be approximately 2,666,904.55.\n\nThus the final “Total Expenses” item in the income statement is 2666904.55.\n\nThe answer is presented in the requested json format as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Expenses\": \"2666904.55\"}}\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAny minor rounding differences aside, this is the final total expense value computed from the transactions data.",
