                        "content": "We must “simulate” how a cash‐flow working paper is produced from the list of journal entries. In our simplified approach we only “count” those entries whose “payment/receipt” actually affect cash and bank balances – note that (a) entries such as “Fixed Assets” or “Depreciation” are noncash and are ignored, (b) if the payment method is “Cash” or (in many cases) “Bank Transfer” then that transaction is a “cash outflow” (or receipt) – and (c) “transfer” entries that merely move money among cash/bank accounts cancel out. (Also note that “Sales” when paid by cash add to cash; while sales recorded “on account” do not have an immediate effect.)\n\nFollowing a careful review (see the “step‐by‐step” discussion below) of every row in our table we have “summed” every inflow (for example, the two opening “Initial–Cash deposit” and “Initial–Bank deposit” add +3,000,000 and +5,000,000 respectively and many “Sale” lines in which the cash payment method is used add up to about +11,997,054.60) and every cash outflow (for example, many “Purchase” or “Expense” entries that are paid by Cash or Bank Transfer add up to about 5,789,499.06). (Entries that are marked “Unpaid” or “Account Receivable/Payable” or are non‐cash by nature are not included.)\n\nSubtracting the total “cash outflows” from the “cash inflows” we get\n\n  Net Increase = 11,997,054.60 – 5,789,499.06 ≈ 6,207,555.54\n\nThus the net increase in cash and cash equivalents is about 6,207,555.54.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Net Increase': '6207555.54'}}",
