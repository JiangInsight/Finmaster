                        "content": "We can “derive” the retained‐earnings balance by “adding” the net operating result (all operating revenue less all operating expenses) during the period to the opening (retained earnings) balance. In our case the “initial” (opening) retained earnings is assumed to be zero (that is, no profit carried‐forward from earlier periods). Then, the “net profit” during 2024 is “summed” from the transactions that “increase profit” (the sales – whose “profit” column already is computed, and any positive interest income) less the “expenses” that reduce profit (– all the “Expense” and Depreciation lines, plus any nonoperating “losses” such as a negative interest if any).\n\nFor example, after “walking‐through” the 200+ transaction lines we obtained (by grouping the sale lines we got a total “sales profit” of roughly 1,340,514 and by summing all expenses (in the various Sales/Administrative/Financial expense and depreciation lines) we obtained a total outlay of roughly 2,629,206. In addition the “Interest Receivables” items (when added up over all days) contribute about +2,651. (One negative interest item—about –31.19 – slightly reduces that total.) Then the net result (net profit) is:\n\n  net profit ≈ 1,340,514 + 2,651 – 2,629,206 = –1,286,041\n\nSince no beginning profit is carried forward, the retained earnings “initial” is 0.00 and the “end” retained earnings equals the net result (a loss) of –1,286,041 (rounded to two decimals).\n\nThus, our final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"-1286041.00\"\n  }\n}\n\n(Any slight differences would come from rounding on each group, but this is our computed approximate answer.)",
