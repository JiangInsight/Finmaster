                        "content": "We need to add up the amounts from the transactions that actually describe a fixed asset purchase. (Notice that an “Initial Fixed Assets” record is simply an opening balance and is not part of the actual purchases during the period.) In the table the fixed asset purchase transactions are those with a type “Fixed Assets Purchase”. Looking at the data our four fixed‑asset purchase rows are as follows:\n\n1. A row with id “FixedAsset20231231001” (the first fixed asset purchase) with an amount of 230120.87  \n2. A second row (again with id “FixedAsset20231231001”) with an amount of 478737.63  \n3. A third fixed asset purchase row with an amount of 351585.3  \n4. A fourth fixed asset purchase row with an amount of 386528.93\n\nNow we sum these amounts:\n• 230120.87 + 478737.63 = 708858.50  \n• 708858.50 + 351585.30 = 1060443.80  \n• 1060443.80 + 386528.93 = 1446972.73\n\nThus the total (final) purchase of fixed assets is 1,446,972.73.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"1446972.73\"} }\n```",
