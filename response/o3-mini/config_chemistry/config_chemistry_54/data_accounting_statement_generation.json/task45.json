                        "content": "We need to “pick‐out” from the full list only those cash transactions that are part of investing activities. In our bookkeeping the only transactions that affect the investing category are those with a type of “Fixed Assets Purchase” (that is, cash paid to acquire a piece of long‑lived (non–current) property, plant, equipment or processing equipment). Although an “Initial … Fixed Assets” row appears at the beginning, that “initial” entry is considered an owner’s injection (a financing event) rather than a cash outflow for investing activities.\n\nLooking down the problem’s data the only rows that count as investing cash flows are the ones with a type of “Fixed Assets Purchase.” In the file we find four such rows:\n\n1. A row with id “FixedAsset20231231001” (row 18) with amount = 230120.87  \n2. Another row with id “FixedAsset20231231001” (row 35) with amount = 478737.63  \n3. A later “FixedAsset20231231001” (row 58) with amount = 351585.3  \n4. And yet another “FixedAsset20231231001” (row 191) with amount = 386528.93\n\nBecause a cash purchase of an asset is an outflow, each of these amounts is recorded as negative.\n\nNow we sum them (ignoring sign until the total is made negative):\n\n• 230120.87  \n+ 478737.63 = 708858.50  \n+ 351585.30 = 1,060,443.80  \n+ 386528.93 = 1,446,972.73  \n\nThus the net cash flow from investing activities is –1,446,972.73.\n\nWe now present the answer accordingly.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-1446972.73\"} }\n```",
