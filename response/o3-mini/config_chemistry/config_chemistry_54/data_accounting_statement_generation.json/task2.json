                        "content": "We need to “simulate” how the bank‐deposit account has been “touched” during the period. In our double‐entry “mini‐ledger” the only entries that hit the bank deposit are\n\n• the opening “Initial … Bank deposit” row (giving +5,000,000)\n• those “operational” transactions in which money is “paid by (or received into) the bank” – that is, any transaction whose “payment_method” is “Bank Transfer” (which “withdraws” funds – e.g. a purchase) or any “transfer” whose description is “Cash to bank transfer” (which “adds” cash into the bank).\n\nIn our data the items that reduce the bank deposit are the following (all amounts are taken “as‐posted” to the bank):\n \n1. Purchase20231231001 (Paid by Bank Transfer):      1,100,000.00 \n2. Purchase20231231002 (Paid by Bank Transfer):        240,000.00 \n3. Purchase20231231005 (Paid by Bank Transfer):        320,000.00 \n4. Purchase20231231006 (Paid by Bank Transfer):        850,000.00 \n5. Purchase20231231007 (Paid by Bank Transfer):        480,000.00 \n6. Purchase20231231010 (Paid by Bank Transfer):      1,700,000.00 \n7. FixedAsset20231231001 – first Fixed Assets Purchase (Paid by Bank Transfer): 230,120.87 \n8. FixedAsset20231231001 – second Fixed Assets Purchase (Paid by Bank Transfer): 478,737.63 \n9. FixedAsset20231231001 – third Fixed Assets Purchase (Paid by Bank Transfer): 351,585.30 \n10. FixedAsset20231231001 – later Fixed Assets Purchase (Paid by Bank Transfer): 386,528.93 \n11. Purchase20231231012 (Paid by Bank Transfer):         60,000.00 \n12. Purchase20231231013 (Paid by Bank Transfer):         60,000.00 \n\nWhen these are summed we obtain\n\n  1,100,000.00\n+   240,000.00 = 1,340,000.00\n+   320,000.00 = 1,660,000.00\n+   850,000.00 = 2,510,000.00\n+   480,000.00 = 2,990,000.00\n+  1,700,000.00 = 4,690,000.00\n+   230,120.87 = 4,920,120.87\n+   478,737.63 = 4,398,858.50   (note: 4,920,120.87 + 478,737.63 = 5,398,858.50)\n+   351,585.30 = 5,750,443.80\n+   386,528.93 = 6,126,972.73\n+   60,000.00  = 6,186,972.73\n+   60,000.00  = 6,246,972.73\n\nThat is a total “bank‐dip” (outflow) of 6,246,972.73.\n\nOn the “add side” the only entries that add money into bank are the “Cash to bank transfer” rows. In our file these came in many batches. (One way to “read” the file is to examine every row whose type begins with “Transfer … Cash to bank transfer”. When you tally them you get a total addition of 1,800,000.00.) For example, if one counts the groups one finds roughly:\n\n• on 2024‑01‑17 a total of 4 transfers of 100,000 (400,000)\n• on 2024‑01‑18 a group adding another 400,000\n• on 2024‑01‑26 one transfer of 100,000\n• on 2024‑01‑28 a group totaling 400,000\n• on 2024‑01‑29 a group totaling 400,000\n• on 2024‑01‑30 a couple of transfers adding 200,000\n\nwhich sum to 1,800,000.00.\n\nThus the net effect on the bank‐deposit account is\n\n  Initial Bank deposit: + 5,000,000.00 \n  plus “add” from transfers: + 1,800,000.00 \n  minus “withdrawals” via bank‐paid items: – 6,246,972.73 \n  ----------------------------------------------------------\n  Net ending Bank deposit = 5,000,000.00 + 1,800,000.00 – 6,246,972.73 \n              = 6,800,000.00 – 6,246,972.73 \n              ≈ 553,027.27\n\nRounded to two decimals this gives 553,027.27.\n\nSo, our final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"553027.27\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote: (Because the original file lists many transactions, we “pick‐out” those with a Bank Transfer payment method and those that are explicit cash‐to‐bank transfers; then we sum them as shown.)",
