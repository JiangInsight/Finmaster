                        "content": "After reviewing the data we must decide which transactions affect the “liabilities” amount. In our bookkeeping system the opening “Initial” entries record assets (cash, bank, fixed assets) so no opening liabilities are present. Then we review the “Purchase” transactions. (A “Purchase” may be recorded as a liability when it is made on credit – indicated by an “Unpaid” payment/receipt status and (often) a payment method such as “Account Payable”.)\n\nIn the new data set there are several “Purchase” rows. In our review we find that:\n• The row with id “Purchase20231231001” is “Paid” → not a liability.\n• The row with id “Purchase20231231002” is “Paid” → not a liability.\n• The row with id “Purchase20231231003” appears with payment/receipt status “Unpaid” (and its payment method is “Account Payable”) with an amount of 90,000.0.\n• The row with id “Purchase20231231004” is “Paid.”\n• The row with id “Purchase20231231005” is “Paid.”\n• The row with id “Purchase20231231006” is “Paid.”\n• The row with id “Purchase20231231007” is “Paid.”\n• The row with id “Purchase20231231008” is recorded as “Unpaid” (and typically when a purchase is not paid it appears on “Account Payable”) with an amount of 2,300,000.0.\n• The remaining “Purchase” entries (“Purchase20231231009”, “Purchase20231231010”, “Purchase20231231011”, “Purchase20231231012” and “Purchase20231231013”) are “Paid.”\n\nNo other type of transaction (such as Interest Receivables) counts as a liability in our balance‐sheet; interest receivables are amounts owed to the business (an asset), not amounts the business owes.\n\nThus, there are no initial (opening) liabilities – so the “Total Liabilities Initial Value” is 0.00.\n\nAt “end” the only liability–related amounts come from the two unpaid purchase transactions:\n  90,000.0 + 2,300,000.0 = 2,390,000.0\n\nWe then present the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\nBelow is the final answer.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"2390000.00\"}}",
