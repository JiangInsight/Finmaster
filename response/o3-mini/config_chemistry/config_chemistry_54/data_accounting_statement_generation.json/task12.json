                        "content": "We need to “roll‐up” all transactions that result in an outstanding (unpaid) purchase obligation (i.e. a “Purchase” record with payment/receipt status “Unpaid” that is carried on “Account Payable” rather than “Paid” using cash/bank). In other words, on the balance‐sheet the accounts payable balance is the sum of purchase transactions that have not been paid.\n\nStep‑by‑step we check the “Purchase” type entries in the data (ignoring “Fixed Assets Purchase” that are not a payable for now):\n\n1. Transaction “Purchase20231231001” is marked “Paid” so it was already settled.\n2. Transaction “Purchase20231231002” is marked “Paid” as well.\n3. Transaction “Purchase20231231003” is marked “Unpaid” and its amount is 90,000.0 (it is made via “Account Payable”).\n4. Transaction “Purchase20231231004” is “Paid.”\n5. Transaction “Purchase20231231005” is “Paid.”\n6. Transaction “Purchase20231231006” is “Paid.”\n7. Transaction “Purchase20231231007” is “Paid.”\n8. Transaction “Purchase20231231008” is marked “Unpaid” with an amount of 2,300,000.0 (again using “Account Payable” as the payment method).\n9. The remaining purchase transactions (“Purchase20231231009”, …, “Purchase20231231013”) are “Paid.”\n\nThus the only purchase transactions that are still outstanding are:\n • “Purchase20231231003” for 90,000.0 \n • “Purchase20231231008” for 2,300,000.0\n\nTheir sum is 90,000.0 + 2,300,000.0 = 2,390,000.0.\n\nAlso, we notice that the “Initial” transactions (the starting balances on 2023‑12‑31) list cash, bank, fixed assets but do not include any accounts payable so the opening (initial) accounts payable amount is zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"2390000.00\"\n  }\n}",
