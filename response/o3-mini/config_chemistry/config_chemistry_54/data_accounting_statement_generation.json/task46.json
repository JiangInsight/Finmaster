There are three initial records:\n • “Cash deposit” for 3,000,000.0 \n • “Bank deposit” for 5,000,000.0 \n • “Fixed Assets” for 5,000,000.0\n\nWhen determining the “cash and cash equivalents” balance, only cash and bank deposits are included. (Although fixed assets are recorded with a cash‐related transaction here, they are not considered cash nor cash equivalents.) Therefore, we add the cash deposit and bank deposit:\n  3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 = 8,000,000.0\n\nAny subsequent transactions (expenses, purchases, sales, transfers, etc.) over the period will adjust the cash flow over the period but do not affect the “beginning” balance. (Transfers between bank and cash accounts do not change the total cash and cash equivalents.) \n\nThus the final beginning cash and cash equivalents balance is 8,000,000.00.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\"\n  }\n}",
