In our case only the “Sale” (which already carry a “profit” amount) and certain “Interest Receivables” records (which for our income statement appear on the income side) add to income while all “Expense”–typed records (including depreciation and various operating expense sub–categories) must be subtracted. (Items such as “Purchase”, “Initial”, “Transfer” and “Fixed Assets …” affect balance–sheet accounts and not the income statement.)\n\nThus one acceptable method is to sum\n\n  • (all “Sale” transactions’ “profit” amounts) \n  • plus (all “Interest Receivables” amounts)\n  • then subtract (the “amount” sums for every transaction whose type begins with “Expense” or is “Depreciation”).\n\nFor the given table the detailed work (see below) gives:\n\n  Total “Sale” profit ≈ 1,339,513.79  \n  Total “Interest Receivables” ≈ 2,566.70  \n  Total “Expenses” (all Expense/Depreciation rows) ≈ 2,580,962.06\n\nSo the net profit is computed as\n\n  Net Profit = (Sale profit + Interest income) – Expenses  \n        = (1,339,513.79 + 2,566.70) – 2,580,962.06  \n        ≈ 1,342,080.49 – 2,580,962.06  \n        ≈ –1,238,881.57\n\nWe then round to two decimals (if desired) and report the net profit as –1,238,881.57.\n\nBelow is our final answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"-1238881.57\"} }\n```",
