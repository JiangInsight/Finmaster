                        "content": "We need to “build” the current‐liabilities amount by “picking” only those transactions that add to the company’s payables (and similar short–term obligations). In our data the “Initial” rows show only asset “opening‐balances” (cash, bank and fixed asset) so at the start no liability appears. Then among the various transactions the ones that “create” an account payable are those Purchase records whose “payment/receipt_status” was marked “Unpaid.”\n\nIf we scan through the data we find two Purchase transactions with an “Unpaid” status:\n\n• A Purchase with id “Purchase20231231003” (row 19) for 90,000.0\n\n• A Purchase with id “Purchase20231231008” (row 58) for 2,300,000.0\n\nNo other transaction in the list represents an obligation (the many “Interest Receivables” are items the company expects to receive, not owe, and the remaining items are either already “Paid” or represent asset acquisitions or expense payments).\n\nThus the total current liabilities at period end is simply the sum of the two “Unpaid purchase” transactions:\n\n  90,000.0 + 2,300,000.0 = 2,390,000.0\n\nSince there were no current liabilities in the opening (“Initial”) entries the initial current liabilities amount is 0.00.\n\nWe now present the answer in the required json format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"2390000.00\"\n  }\n}",
