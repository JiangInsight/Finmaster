In other words, each sale on credit “creates” an increase in receivables. For example, in the sample table the “Sale” transactions with a receive_method of “Account Receviable” are (showing the “after tax” amounts):\n\n• Sale20240105009: 2,49166.72  \n• Sale20240107015: 196,387.40  \n• Sale20240109020: 25,458.08  \n• Sale20240112025: 21,953.76  \n• Sale20240117035: 106,371.46  \n• Sale20240118039: 313,111.54  \n• Sale20240119041: 42,363.05  \n• Sale20240120042: 23,649.21  \n• Sale20240122045: 560,237.66  \n• Sale20240123047: 94,838.12  \n• Sale20240123048: 285,572.42  \n• Sale20240124050: 569,816.46  \n• Sale20240127055: 183,551.11  \n• Sale20240128057: 104,809.22\n\nSumming these up step‐by‐step:\n\n 249,166.72 + 196,387.40 = 445,554.12  \n 445,554.12 + 25,458.08 = 471,012.20  \n 471,012.20 + 21,953.76 = 492,965.96  \n 492,965.96 + 106,371.46 = 599,337.42  \n 599,337.42 + 313,111.54 = 912,448.96  \n 912,448.96 + 42,363.05 = 954,812.01  \n 954,812.01 + 23,649.21 = 978,461.22  \n 978,461.22 + 560,237.66 = 1,538,698.88  \n 1,538,698.88 + 94,838.12 = 1,633,537.00  \n 1,633,537.00 + 285,572.42 = 1,919,109.42  \n 1,919,109.42 + 569,816.46 = 2,488,925.88  \n 2,488,925.88 + 183,551.11 = 2,672,476.99  \n 2,672,476.99 + 104,809.22 = 2,777,286.21\n\nBecause an increase in accounts receivable represents a use (or “decrease”) of cash, the cash‐flow “effect” is shown with a negative sign.\n\nThus, the final accounts receivable item (the net change) is –2,777,286.21.\n\nWe now present the answer in the required format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-2777286.21\"\n  }\n}",
