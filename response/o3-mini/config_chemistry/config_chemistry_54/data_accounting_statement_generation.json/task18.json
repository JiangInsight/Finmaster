                        "content": "We can “back‐calculate” the owner’s equity at year–end by “starting” with the three “initial” posting amounts (which in our table are the owner’s initial cash, bank‐deposit and fixed assets amounts) and then “adjusting” for the “net income” (or “net loss”) produced during the reporting period. In our books the “initial” injections total\n\n  3000000.00 + 5000000.00 + 5000000.00 = 13,000,000.00\n\nNext we must compute “net income” as follows. The “sale” transactions have a “profit” field which gives the gross profit (the sale minus its “cost_amount”) for that sale. (Any operating cost that is not “built into” the cost for inventory must be subtracted separately.) In our many “Sale…” rows the profit numbers (when summed) add up to about 1,381,093.14. However, besides the cost “included” in the sale profit, our business has separately recorded operating expense items – for example, “Expense” rows for administrative, sales and financial costs as well as a “Depreciation” posting. When we add up all the (non–capitalizing) expenses from all the Expense… rows we get about 2,510,727.08; and adding the Depreciation amount of 45,742.50 gives a total “period expense” of roughly\n\n  2,510,727.08 + 45,742.50 ≈ 2,556,469.58\n\n(Transfers and purchases that create inventory or change bank versus cash do not affect profit.) Also, a set of “Interest Receivable” postings (even though some are “unpaid”) in total add about 2,455.57 in “other income” that must be added.\n\nThus, a very simplified “net income” figure is computed as\n\n  (net income) = (sum of sale profits + interest income) – (all operating expenses)\n    ≈ (1,381,093.14 + 2,455.57) – 2,556,469.58\n    ≈ 1,383,548.71 – 2,556,469.58\n    ≈ –1,172,920.87\n\nThat is, our operations produced a net loss of roughly 1,172,920.87. (The many postings that “include” a profit per sale do not themselves include the large collection of general expenses that are recorded separately.)\n\nBecause owner’s equity “ends” with the initial injection plus accumulated (negative or positive) net income, the balance‐sheet “end value” of Owners’ Equity is\n\n  13,000,000.00 + (–1,172,920.87) ≈ 11,827,079.13\n\nThus the solution – with amounts rounded to two decimals – is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"11827079.13\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote: In practice one would “allocate” each posting to the proper income statement account and then “close” them into retained earnings. Here the “sale” rows already include a “profit” field while the many “Expense” rows (and the recorded Depreciation) stand for period‐costs. The net result is a loss that reduces owners’ equity from its initial injection level.",
