In our table each “Expense” row that has its type field equal to “Sales Expenses” contributes to the final item in the income statement. (Other expense types such as “Administrative Expenses” and “Financial Expenses” are not included in “Sales Expenses”.)\n\nBelow is a list of the rows with type “Sales Expenses” and their amounts:\n\n1.
