                        "content": "We need to determine, by scanning through all the transactions, which items contribute to Accounts Payable.\n\nAccounts Payable in these records comes from Purchase transactions that were “Unpaid” and recorded with a payment method of “Account Payable.” (Any purchase paid by “Bank Transfer” or “Cash” does not leave a balance outstanding on Accounts Payable.)\n\nStep‐by‐step inspection:\n\n1. Look at all “Purchase” records (or similar buying transactions) that could increase accounts payable. In our table the ones with “Purchase” as type are the ones to review.\n\n2. In the provided data, we identify the following “Purchase” rows having “Unpaid” payment/receipt status and a payment_method of “Account Payable”:\n • Row with id Purchase20231231003:\n  – Amount = 90,000.0 \n  – Payment status = Unpaid \n  – Payment method = Account Payable.\n • Row with id Purchase20231231008:\n  – Amount = 2,300,000.0 \n  – Payment status = Unpaid \n  – Payment method = Account Payable.\n\n3. No other transaction uses “Account Payable” as the payment method when “Unpaid.” (All other “Purchase” transactions are marked as “Paid” and use “Cash,” “Bank Transfer,” etc. Note also that initial balance transactions – Cash deposit and Bank deposit – or fixed asset purchases are not recorded via account payable.)\n\n4. Hence the total increase in Accounts Payable is simply the sum of the amounts of these two transactions:\n  90,000.0 + 2,300,000.0 = 2,390,000.0\n\n5. There are no additional transactions (like later payments of outstanding bills) that reduce the AP balance. Therefore the final “increase” (or net balance increase) in Accounts Payable is 2,390,000.00.\n\nThus the answer will be presented as follows:\n\n==============================================\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"2390000.00\"}\n}\n\nThis is the final value (an increase in Accounts Payable) as computed from the provided data.",
