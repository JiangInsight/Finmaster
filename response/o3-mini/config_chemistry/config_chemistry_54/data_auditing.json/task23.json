                        "content": "We inspected the invoice details for the sale with id \"Sale20240102003\". In the invoice text it states that the sale consists of 1.0 unit at a unit price of 56077.82 so that the total sale amount is 56077.82. It also tells us that the tax amount is 2803.89 so that the “after‐tax” amount would be 56077.82 – 2803.89 = 53273.93. Given that the cost amount is 50000.00 the “profit” should be 53273.93 – 50000.00 = 3273.93. However, the recorded profit is 6077.82 – which is inconsistent with the calculations based on the other fields.\n\nBelow is our output for the inconsistency we found:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Original date\": \"2024-01-02\",\n    \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-02\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n    \"Original payment_method\": \"Cash\",\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Cash\",\n    \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"1.0\",\n    \"Original price\": \"56077.82\",\n    \"Recorded price\": \"56077.82\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": \"Cash\",\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\",\n    \"Original amount\": \"56077.82\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"56077.82\",\n    \"Original tax\": \"2803.89\",\n    \"Recorded tax\": \"2803.89\",\n    \"Original profit\": \"3273.93\",\n    \"Recorded profit\": \"6077.82\",\n    \"Original Preparer\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": \"\",\n    \"Original Approver\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded Approver\": \"\",\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240102003\"\n  }\n}",
