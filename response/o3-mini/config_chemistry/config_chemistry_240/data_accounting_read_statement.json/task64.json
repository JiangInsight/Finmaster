This is represented by the \"Paid-in Capital\" line item. Its End_amount is 13000000.00.\n\n2. From the Income Statement, the profit or loss before deducting tax expense. This is provided in the \"Profit Before Tax\" line item. Its Amount is -923950.35.\n\n3. From the Cash Flow Statement, the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit. This is given by the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" line item. Its Amount is 3010000.00.\n\nAccording to the instructions, we group the values by the statement order as follows:\n• Balance Sheet (Paid-in Capital) – 13000000.00  \n• Income Statement (Profit Before Tax) – -923950.35  \n• Cash Flow Statement (Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable) – 3010000.00\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value1\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"value2\": \"-923950.35\",\n    \"value3\": \"3010000.00\"\n  }\n}",
