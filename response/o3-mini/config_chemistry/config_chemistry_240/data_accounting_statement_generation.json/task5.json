                        "content": "We must “build” the balance‐sheet “interest receivable” by gathering together all transactions with type “Interest Receivables.” In our file no “Initial” (opening balance) interest receivable is entered (all “initial” records are deposits or fixed‐asset opening entries), so we assume that before any interest transaction was recorded the interest receivable balance was zero. Then each “Interest Receivables” transaction has an “amount” that is added if positive and subtracted if negative.\n\nBelow is a step‐by‐step outline (note that I round each printed intermediate result to two decimals):\n\n1. From the file we extract (in order of appearance) these “Interest Receivables” amounts:\n • 428.09  \n • 428.09  \n • 388.04  \n • 388.04  \n • 348.88  \n • 348.88  \n • 348.88  \n • 348.88  \n • 348.88  \n • 348.88  \n • 108.58  \n • 108.58  \n • 62.57               (62.5727… rounded to 62.57)  \n • 62.57  \n • 62.57  \n • 62.57  \n • 62.57  \n • 62.57  \n • 62.57  \n • 62.57  \n • 18.86      (from 18.86322693)  \n • –7.84    (–7.83677307 rounded)  \n • –16.74  (–16.73677307 rounded)  \n • 9.96    (9.96322693 rounded)  \n • 2.38    (2.38487337 rounded)  \n • 11.28   (11.28487337 rounded)  \n • 11.28   (11.28487337 again)  \n • 5.75    (5.75345573 rounded)  \n • 14.65   (14.65345573 rounded)\n\n2. We “accumulate” them in the order they appear starting at an “initial balance” of 0.00:\n – After the first two entries: 428.09 + 428.09 = 856.18  \n – Adding the next two: 856.18 + 388.04 + 388.04 = 1632.26 + 388.04 = 1244.22 → 1632.26  \n  [see below the “running total”]\n   • 0.00  \n   • +428.09 = 428.09  \n   • +428.09 = 856.18  \n   • +388.04 = 1244.22  \n   • +388.04 = 1632.26  \n   • +348.88 = 1981.14  \n   • +348.88 = 2330.02  \n   • +348.88 = 2678.90  \n   • +348.88 = 3027.78  \n   • +348.88 = 3376.66  \n   • +348.88 = 3725.54  \n   • +108.58 = 3834.12  \n   • +108.58 = 3942.70  \n   • +62.57 = 4005.27  \n   • +62.57 = 4067.84  \n   • +62.57 = 4130.41  \n   • +62.57 = 4192.98  \n   • +62.57 = 4255.55  \n   • +62.57 = 4318.12  \n   • +62.57 = 4380.69  \n   • +62.57 = 4443.26  \n   • +18.86 = 4462.12  \n   • –7.84 = 4454.28  \n   • –16.74 = 4437.54  \n   • +9.96 = 4447.50  \n   • +2.38 = 4449.88  \n   • +11.28 = 4461.16  \n   • +11.28 = 4472.44  \n   • +5.75 = 4478.19  \n   • +14.65 = 4492.84\n\nThus the “end” balance of interest receivable is 4492.84.\n\n3. Since no opening (initial) interest receivable existed, the “Interest Receivable Initial Value” is 0.00.\n\nAccordingly, the two numbers that we report (initial and end-of-period) are:\n\n Interest Receivable Initial Value: 0.00  \n Interest Receivable End Value: 4492.84\n\nBelow is the output in the required JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"4492.84\"\n  }\n}",
