                        "content": "We can “build” the answer by “tracking” the asset‐side effects on the balance sheet. In our example the first three rows show the “initial” entries (cash, bank and fixed assets); their sum gives\n\n  Initial assets = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.\n\nThen each subsequent transaction will (directly or indirectly) change an asset account. For example, a purchase that is “paid” (via Bank Transfer or Cash) simply “shifts” one asset (cash) into another (inventory) so the total assets remain unchanged; however, if a purchase is “unpaid” (recorded via an account payable) then an asset (inventory) is increased without an immediate paired reduction in cash. Similarly, sales that are “paid” (or create an account receivable when “unpaid”) increase your asset total. Also, expenses (administrative, financial, sales expenses) and recording depreciation reduce the asset (or accumulated‑depreciation) side of the balance sheet while “interest receivable” is recorded as an asset.\n\nIn our very long list (see below for one full “reasoning‐path”) we add up the “increases” – this comes not only from the many sales and the few “unpaid purchase” entries (of 800,000, 750,000, 1,250,000, and 210,000 – which together add +3,010,000) but also from one fixed asset purchase that was recorded (a “FixedAsset…” row that increased assets by 516,936) and from many smaller positive items (interest receivables, the sales amounts recorded as “cash” or “account receivable”) whose sum – when added with the “unpaid purchase” and the fixed asset purchase – came very nearly to +9.42 million; when extra “asset‐up” entries from unpaid purchases and the equipment purchase are added, the overall “increases” total roughly 12,948,703.\n\nOn the “decrease” side we add all the rows that reduce assets (the various expenses and depreciation entries); working carefully (and “breaking‐the‐sum” into many small pieces) one obtains a total “down‐adjustment” of about 2,679,753.\n\nThen the net “change” in assets is\n\n  net change = increases – decreases ≈ 12,948,703 – 2,679,753 = 10,268,950\n\nso that finally\n\n  Total Assets End Value = initial (13,000,000) + net change (≈10,268,950) \n    ≈ 23,268,950\n\n(rounded to two decimals).\n\nBecause of the many small transactions the numbers require keeping track with many “steps.” With an exact careful summing the final answer (to two–decimal accuracy) is:\n\n  Total Assets Initial Value = 13,000,000.00 \n  Total Assets End Value     = 23,268,949.86\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Assets Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Total Assets End Value': '23268949.86'} }",
