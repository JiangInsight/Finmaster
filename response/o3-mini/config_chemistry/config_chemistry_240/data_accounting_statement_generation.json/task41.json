                        "content": "We must “net‐out” (i.e. add increases and subtract any subsequent payments) the transactions that affect our outstanding payables.\n\nIn this case only Purchase entries whose payment was neither made by cash/bank nor “Paid” but which are recorded as “Unpaid” and whose payment method is “Account Payable” will “increase” our accounts payable balance. (Other transactions – “Expenses”, “Transfers”, “Sales”, even “Fixed Assets” – do not affect the liability to suppliers.)\n\nLet’s scan the “Purchase” rows in the provided list (ignoring the “Initial” rows) that are entered as “Purchase” and look at their “payment/receipt_status” and “payment_method”:\n\n1. Row with id Purchase20231231001 – This purchase (amount 190,000.0) was “Paid” via “Bank Transfer” so it does not affect accounts payable.\n2. Row Purchase20231231002 – This has amount 800,000.0, status “Unpaid” and payment_method “Account Payable.” That amount will increase our accounts payable by +800,000.0.\n3. Scanning further we find a row with id Purchase20231231003 (amount 450,000.0) but it was “Paid” (via Bank Transfer) so ignore.\n4. Next, Purchase20231231004 – This row has amount 750,000.0, status “Unpaid” with payment_method “Account Payable.” So add +750,000.0.\n5. Next, Purchase20231231005 is “Paid” via Cash so ignore.\n6. Purchase20231231006 and 07 and 08 are paid by bank or cash.\n7. Next, Purchase20231231010 – This row shows an amount of 1,250,000.0, status “Unpaid” and payment_method “Account Payable.” So add +1,250,000.0.\n8. Next, Purchase20231231011 is “Paid” (via Cash) so ignore.\n9. Next, Purchase20231231012 – This row has amount 210,000.0, status “Unpaid” and payment_method “Account Payable.” So add +210,000.0.\n10. The remaining Purchase rows (id 31013, 31014, 31015, etc.) are either paid or use bank/cash, so they do not affect our accounts payable balance.\n\nNow, the net increase in Accounts Payable is the sum of these unpaid amounts:\n  800,000.0 + 750,000.0 = 1,550,000.0  \n  1,550,000.0 + 1,250,000.0 = 2,800,000.0  \n  2,800,000.0 + 210,000.0 = 3,010,000.0\n\nNo later transaction “reduces” accounts payable (i.e. there is no subsequent record that shows we have settled an Accounts Payable bill). Thus the final “Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable” is an increase of 3,010,000.00.\n\nAccordingly, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"3010000.00\"\n  }\n}",
