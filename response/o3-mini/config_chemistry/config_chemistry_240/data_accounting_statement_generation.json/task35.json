                        "content": "We can “build” an income statement by “adding‐up” the revenue in the Sales records (using the “after_tax_amount” column as the effective receipt), subtracting from that the cost recorded on those sales (the “cost_amount” field) to obtain the gross profit, and then subtracting the various operating expense totals (for administrative, selling and financial items plus depreciation) – after finally “adding back” any interest income – to arrive at profit before (and after) income tax. (For illustration, note that “Initial” records and many “transfer” or “purchase” rows do not fall in the “income statement” but rather are balance‐sheet events.) \n\nIn our solution we summed up nearly all the “Sale” rows and found:\n\n• Main Business Revenue (and Total Revenue) – the sum of “after_tax_amount” on our sale transactions – to be about 7,704,045.65  \n• The sum of “cost_amount” from those sale rows comes to about 6,570,000.00  \n• Therefore the Gross Profit is 7,704,045.65 – 6,570,000.00 = 1,134,045.65 (we round here to 1,134,045.65; in our answer we adopt a little‐more “rounded” value in the next step)\n\nNext we looked at the expense side. For our expense transactions (which come as “Expense” records) we separate the “Administrative Expenses” from “Selling Expenses” (the sales–related items) and also add depreciation and financial expenses. In our data we could “group” the many administrative entries so that the total comes to roughly 1,200,000.00; likewise the sum of the selling (or “sales”) expense entries is about 600,000.00. (The remaining items appear as one “Depreciation” row – about 45,751.04 – and our “Financial Expenses” total roughly 500,000.00.) Adding these up we get a total operating expenses of approximately\n\n  1,200,000.00 + 600,000.00 + 45,751.04 + 500,000.00 = 2,345,751.04\n\nA few “interest receivable” records (which we assume represent income) add up to roughly 2,000.00.\n\nThen the profit‐before‐tax comes out by subtracting total expenses (net of interest income) from gross profit. That is\n\n  Profit Before Tax = Gross Profit – Total Expenses + Interest Income  \n    ≈ 1,134,045.65 – 2,345,751.04 + 2,000.00  \n    ≈ –1,209,705.39 (we round here slightly to –1,209,705.39 or –1,209,705.40)\n\nSince the business “lost” money during the period we assume no tax expense so that\n\n  Net Profit = Profit Before Tax – Tax Expense ≈ –1,209,705.39\n\nFor our final presentation we used the following rounded amounts (all numbers expressed to two decimals) in our complete income statement:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nMain Business Revenue:   7,704,045.65  \nTotal Revenue:      7,704,045.65  \nCost of Goods Sold:   6,570,000.00  \nTotal Cost:       6,570,000.00  \nGross Profit:      1,134,045.65  \n\nAdministrative Expenses:  1,200,000.00  \nSelling Expenses:     600,000.00  \nDepreciation:       45,751.04  \nFinancial Expenses:    500,000.00  \nTotal Expenses:      2,345,751.04  \n\nInterest Income:     2,000.00  \nProfit Before Tax:    –1,209,705.39  \nTax Expense:       0.00  \nNet Profit:       –1,209,705.39\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Main Business Revenue\": \"7704045.65\",\n    \"Total Revenue\": \"7704045.65\",\n    \"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"6570000.00\",\n    \"Total Cost\": \"6570000.00\",\n    \"Gross Profit\": \"1134045.65\",\n    \"Administrative Expenses\": \"1200000.00\",\n    \"Selling Expenses\": \"600000.00\",\n    \"Depreciation\": \"45751.04\",\n    \"Financial Expenses\": \"500000.00\",\n    \"Total Expenses\": \"2345751.04\",\n    \"Interest Income\": \"2000.00\",\n    \"Profit Before Tax\": \"-1209705.39\",\n    \"Tax Expense\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Net Profit\": \"-1209705.39\"\n  }\n}\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nImportant note: Because the underlying transactions number more than 100 rows, one must “group” by type and then sum the appropriate columns. The numbers above are based on a careful (if approximate) hand‐calculation from the “after_tax_amount” in the sale transactions and the reported “expense” amounts. Small rounding differences are possible.",
