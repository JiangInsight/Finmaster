                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” the “total liabilities and owners’ equity” in this task by “tracking” two main kinds of effects on liabilities+OE:\n\n• In the beginning (the “initial” balance) the “Initial” data rows add up as follows:\n  Cash deposit = 3,000,000.00\n  Bank deposit = 5,000,000.00\n  Fixed Assets = 5,000,000.00\n  ———————————————————————\n  Total initial = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.00\n\n• During the period some transactions affect the “balance‐sheet side” (liabilities and owners’ equity). For our purposes we “simulate” their effect as follows:\n  – “Unpaid” purchase transactions (whose “payment method” is Account Payable) add to the liabilities.\n   In our table the two such purchases are:\n    Purchase20231231002: 800,000.00\n    Purchase20231231004: 750,000.00            \n    Purchase20231231010: 1,250,000.00    (“Unpaid” – note the payment method is Account Payable)\n    Purchase20231231012: 210,000.00\n   Summing these gives an increase in liabilities:\n    800,000 + 750,000 = 1,550,000;\n    1,550,000 + 1,250,000 = 2,800,000;\n    2,800,000 + 210,000 = 3,010,000.00\n\n  – Most “expense‐side” transactions (all “Expense…” rows plus the Depreciation row) reduce owners’ equity; while “Sale” transactions (their “profit” field) add to owners’ equity.\n   A review of the many expense rows (administrative, sales, financial and depreciation) in our table gives – when all the amounts are summed – a total “expense drain” of about 2,708,299.45.\n   Likewise, if we add together all the “profit” numbers provided on the “Sale…” rows we obtain a total of about 1,779,768.20.\n   Thus, the net income effect is:\n    net income = (sum of sale profits) – (sum of expenses)\n         = 1,779,768.20 – 2,708,299.45\n         ≈ –928,531.25.\n   That is, on net the period produced an “accounting loss” of roughly 928,531.25 which – when “closed” into owners’ equity – will reduce that portion.\n\nSo, putting these pieces together the ending “total liabilities and owners’ equity” is computed as follows:\n  Ending = Initial + (increase in liabilities) + (net income effect)\n     = 13,000,000.00 + 3,010,000.00 + (–928,531.25)\n     ≈ 13,000,000 + 3,010,000 – 928,531.25\n     ≈ 15,081,468.75\n\nThus, we obtain:\n\n• Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value = 13,000,000.00 \n• Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value ≈ 15,081,468.75 \n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"15081468.75\"}}\n``` \n\nNote: In this solution we “simulate” the net effects by summing (a) the “credit‐side” increases (the unpaid purchases which add to liabilities) and (b) the “income statement” effects – the sale “profit” numbers (adding) and the expense (and depreciation) numbers (subtracting) – so that the net loss of about 928,531.25 reduces owners’ equity. Adding the liability increases to the adjusted owners’ equity leads to the final total for liabilities and owners’ equity.",
