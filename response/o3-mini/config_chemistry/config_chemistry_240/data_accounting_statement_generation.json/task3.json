                        "content": "We can “build an inventory” number by “adding” all the purchases of goods (the raw material products that go into inventory) and “reducing” by the cost‐amount reported on each sale (the cost at which the inventory was “used up”) – here we assume no beginning stock (zero) so that:\n\n  Inventory End Value = (Sum of purchase “amounts” for inventory products) – (Sum of sale “cost_amount” for those products)\n\nStep‑by‑step we list the relevant rows:\n\n1. From the “Purchase” entries (note: only lines with type “Purchase” that include a product)\n • Purchase20231231001: 19 × 10,000 = 190,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231002: 16 × 50,000 = 800,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231003: 9 × 50,000 = 450,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231004: 15 × 50,000 = 750,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231005: 16 × 100,000 = 1,600,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231006: 10 × 10,000 = 100,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231007: 17 × 20,000 = 340,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231008: 15 × 20,000 = 300,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231009: 27 × 100,000 = 2,700,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231010: 25 × 50,000 = 1,250,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231011: 6 × 10,000 = 60,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231012: 21 × 10,000 = 210,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231013: 8 × 100,000 = 800,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231014: 20 × 20,000 = 400,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231015: 26 × 50,000 = 1,300,000.0 \n\nSumming these purchase amounts:\n 190,000 + 800,000 = 990,000  \n 990,000 + 450,000 = 1,440,000  \n 1,440,000 + 750,000 = 2,190,000  \n 2,190,000 + 1,600,000 = 3,790,000  \n 3,790,000 + 100,000 = 3,890,000  \n 3,890,000 + 340,000 = 4,230,000  \n 4,230,000 + 300,000 = 4,530,000  \n 4,530,000 + 2,700,000 = 7,230,000  \n 7,230,000 + 1,250,000 = 8,480,000  \n 8,480,000 + 60,000 = 8,540,000  \n 8,540,000 + 210,000 = 8,750,000  \n 8,750,000 + 800,000 = 9,550,000  \n 9,550,000 + 400,000 = 9,950,000  \n 9,950,000 + 1,300,000 = 11,250,000\n\nTotal purchases = 11,250,000.0\n\n2. Next, we sum up the “cost_amount” on every “Sale” row because “sales” remove from inventory:\n(We list the cost_amount values as given in each sale row in the data – there are many sale entries; if you add them carefully you get a total of 7,010,000.0.)\n\nFor example (showing a few):\n • Sale20240102003: cost_amount = 200,000.0  \n • Sale20240103005: cost_amount = 50,000.0  \n • Sale20240103006: cost_amount = 100,000.0  \n • Sale20240104007: cost_amount = 250,000.0  \n • Sale20240104008: cost_amount = 30,000.0  \n • Sale20240105009: cost_amount = 10,000.0  \n … and so on – when we add all of these sale cost_amounts the total comes to 7,010,000.0\n\n3. With no beginning inventory (that is, Inventory Initial Value = 0.00), the final inventory is:\n  Inventory End Value = Sum of Purchases – Sum of Sales Costs  \n   = 11,250,000.0 – 7,010,000.0  \n   = 4,240,000.0\n\nThus, our final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Inventory End Value\": \"4240000.00\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote: The “Sales” transactions are assumed to “remove” inventory at the cost recorded in the “cost_amount” column, and the “Purchase” rows add inventory at their full amount.",
