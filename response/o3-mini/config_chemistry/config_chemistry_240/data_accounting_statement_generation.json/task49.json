These items together yield a net operating cash flow of –4,004,648.96. In investing activities the only outflow was for fixed asset acquisitions – here the sum of the separate “Fixed Assets Purchase” transactions (outside the initial establishment) was taken as 1,593,203.67 (and reported as 1,593,203.67 outflow). For presentation purposes the separate “Cash Flow From Operating Activities” and “Cash Flow from Investing Activities” lines are set to 0.00 while the net effect appears in the “Net Cash Flow …” lines. With an initial cash balance of 8,000,000.00 the net decrease of –5,597,852.63 produces an ending balance of 2,402,147.37. These numbers are representative and derived by step‑by‑step grouping of the transactions above.",
