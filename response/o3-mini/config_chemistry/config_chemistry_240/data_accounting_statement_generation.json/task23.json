In our case the only products that are “sold” are Chemical Product A, Chemical Product C, Chemical Product D and Chemical Product B. (The “Initial” and “Fixed Assets” and “Expense” etc. entries do not affect inventory cost.) \n\nTo explain briefly, we first “gather” for each product the purchase cost (we assume that each purchase for a given product had a fixed cost‑per‑unit, so when an item later sells the cost is its purchase unit cost) and then, for every “Sale” line, we compute the cost portion as (sold quantity × cost per unit).\n\nThe data give us (note that cost per unit is explicitly provided in purchase rows):\n\n• For Chemical Product A (product P001)\n  – Purchases (all at 10,000 per unit):\n  • Purchase20231231001: 19 units at 10,000 each\n  • Purchase20231231011: 10 units at 10,000 each \n  • Purchase20231231012: 21 units at 10,000 each  \n  Total available = 19 + 10 + 21 = 50 units\n  – Sales of product P001 (we add sold quantities):\n  • Sale20240104008: 3 units\n  • Sale20240108017: 4 units\n  • Sale20240112027: 1 unit\n  • Sale20240115033: 4 units\n  • Sale20240116034: 5 units\n  • Sale20240117036: 5 units\n  • Sale20240129054: 3 units  \n  Total sold = 3+4+1+4+5+5+3 = 25 units\n  – Thus, cost component = 25 × 10,000 = 250,000\n\n• For Chemical Product C (product P003)\n  – Purchases (all at 50,000 per unit):\n  • Purchase20231231002: 16 units (16 × 50,000 = 800,000)\n  • Purchase20231231003: 9 units         (9 × 50,000 = 450,000)\n  • Purchase20231231004: 15 units       (15 × 50,000 = 750,000)\n  • Purchase20231231010: 25 units       (25 × 50,000 = 1,250,000)\n  • Purchase20231231015: 26 units       (26 × 50,000 = 1,300,000)\n  Total purchased = 16 + 9 + 15 + 25 + 26 = 91 units\n  – Sales for P003 (summing sold quantities from each sale line):\n  • Sale20240102003: 4 units\n  • Sale20240103005: 1 unit\n  • Sale20240103006: 2 units\n  • Sale20240104007: 5 units\n  • Sale20240107016: 3 units\n  • Sale20240109019: 3 units\n  • Sale20240111024: 4 units\n  • Sale20240112028: 2 units\n  • Sale20240114031: 3 units\n  • Sale20240115032: 4 units\n  • Sale20240116035: 2 units\n  • Sale20240126053: 3 units\n  • Sale20240119042: 2 units\n  • Sale20240120044: 4 units\n  • Sale20240123049: 1 unit\n  • Sale20240124050: 4 units\n  • Sale20240130056: 2 units\n  • Sale20240129055: 4 units  \n  Total sold = 4+1+2+5+3+3+4+2+3+4+2+3+2+4+1+4+2+4 = 53 units   (you can check that 4+1=5, 5+2=7, +5=12, +3=15, +3=18, +4=22, +2=24, +3=27, +4=31, +2=33, +3=36, +2=38, +4=42, +1=43, +4=47, +2=49, +4=53)\n  – Thus, cost component = 53 × 50,000 = 2,650,000\n\n• For Chemical Product D (product P004)\n  – Purchases:\n  • Purchase20231231005: 16 units at 100,000 each (1,600,000)\n  • Purchase20231231009: 27 units at 100,000 each (2,700,000)\n  • Purchase20231231013: 8 units at 100,000 each   (800,000)\n  Total = 16 + 27 + 8 = 51 units\n  – Sales of P004:\n  • Sale20240106011: 2 units\n  • Sale20240106012: 4 units\n  • Sale20240108018: 5 units\n  • Sale20240111025: 5 units\n  • Sale20240119043: 4 units\n  • Sale20240121045: 1 unit\n  • Sale20240122047: 3 units\n  • Sale20240123048: 5 units\n  • Sale20240128057: 5 units  \n  Total sold = 2+4+5+5+4+1+3+5+5 = 34 units\n  – Thus, cost component = 34 × 100,000 = 3,400,000\n\n• For Chemical Product B (product P002)\n  – Purchases:\n  • Purchase20231231008: 15 units at 20,000 each (300,000)\n  • Purchase20231231014: 20 units at 20,000 each (400,000)\n  Total = 35 units\n  – Sales of P002:\n  • Sale20240107015: 4 units\n  • Sale20240109020: 3 units\n  • Sale20240110021: 2 units\n  • Sale20240113029: 2 units\n  • Sale20240118038: 2 units\n  • Sale20240118039: 5 units\n  • Sale20240121046: 3 units\n  • Sale20240130057: 3 units  \n  Total sold = 4+3+2+2+2+5+3+3 = 22 units\n  – Thus, cost component = 22 × 20,000 = 440,000\n\nFinally, the overall cost of goods sold comes from adding the cost portions from all products:\n  P001: 250,000 \n  P003: 2,650,000 \n  P004: 3,400,000 \n  P002: 440,000 \nSum = 250,000 + 2,650,000 = 2,900,000; \n  2,900,000 + 3,400,000 = 6,300,000; \n  6,300,000 + 440,000 = 6,740,000\n\nTherefore, the final Cost of Goods Sold is 6,740,000.00.\n\nWe now present the solution in the requested JSON format.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"6740000.00\"\n  }\n}",
