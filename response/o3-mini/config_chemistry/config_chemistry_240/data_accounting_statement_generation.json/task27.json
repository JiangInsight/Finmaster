(A quick outline of the work below shows that we went row‐by‐row, found the “Administrative Expenses” rows, and then summed each amount.)\n\nFor example (showing, not all details):\n\n• On 2024‑01‑01 “Administrative Expenses” you see 37,969.92  \n• On 2024‑01‑02 there are three “Administrative Expenses” rows: 45,081.08, 36,805.48, and 44,888.15  \n• Then on 2024‑01‑03 there are three rows: 18,776.65, 32,203.00 and 6,540.08  \n• … (and many more rows follow)  \n• Up to the last “Administrative Expenses” row on 2024‑01‑30 amounting to 22,841.68\n\nWhen we sum all these “Administrative Expenses” amounts throughout the period we arrive at a total of 1,776,178.15. \n\nThus the final administrative expenses item on the income statement is 1,776,178.15.\n\nThe answer in the required json format is:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Administrative Expenses\": \"1776178.15\"} }",
