                        "content": "We can think of the “owner’s equity” as coming first from the initial injection provided by the owner (the “Initial20231231001” transactions) and then adjusted later by the “net profit” earned (or lost) over the period. In our example the work‐paper method was as follows:\n\n1. The three “Initial…” rows are:\n  • Cash deposit:     3,000,000.00 \n  • Bank deposit:     5,000,000.00 \n  • Fixed Assets:     5,000,000.00 \n That gives an initial total of 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.00\n\n2. Next the operating “profit” (or loss) is “added” to the initial owners equity. In our records many transactions affect profit. One way to “simulate” the profit calculation is to sum up:\n  (a) the sales “profit” figures (the sales lines carry a “profit” number) plus any interest‐income items \n  (b) subtract from that the total expense outlays (including the various “Expense…” items and the depreciation).\n\nIn our detailed review we obtained (by summing over the many lines) approximately:\n\n  • Total profit from all Sale rows = about 1,641,807.77  \n  • Total “interest receivable” income (when summed over many interest transactions) ≈ 4,535.01  \n  • The sum of all “Expense…”‐type transactions (that is, the Sales, Administrative, Financial expenses computed on each day) came out to roughly 2,525,542.36 and \n  • Plus the Depreciation expense of 45,751.04 \n  → so total “expense–like” items ≈ 2,571,293.40\n\nThus the net operating result is:\n  net profit ≈ (Sales profit + Interest income) – (Total expenses + Depreciation)\n    ≈ (1,641,807.77 + 4,535.01) – 2,571,293.40 \n    ≈ 1,646,342.78 – 2,571,293.40 \n    ≈ –924,950.62\n\nThat is, the operations produced a loss of roughly 924,950.62 so that the end total owners’ equity “adjusts” as:\n\n  Final Owners Equity = Initial Owners Equity + Net profit \n    ≈ 13,000,000.00 – 924,950.62 \n    ≈ 12,075,049.38\n\n(Each of these subtotals “rounds” to cents; note that when working through hundreds of transactions the numbers are subject to small rounding differences.)\n\nThus the answer we report is:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"12075049.38\"}}\n\nThis is the step‐by‐step “paper–calculation” that underlies the final result.",
