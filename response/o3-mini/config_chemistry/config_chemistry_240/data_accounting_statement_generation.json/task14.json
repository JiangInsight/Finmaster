(The “initial” transactions are all asset entries so they contribute 0.00 to current liabilities.) \n\nStep‑by‑step we go through the list and pick out the Purchase rows that are “Unpaid” (and normally posted via an “Account Payable” payment method):\n\n• Row “Purchase20231231002” – Amount = 800,000.00; Payment/receipt_status = Unpaid (with payment method “Account Payable”)\n• Row “Purchase20231231004” – Amount = 750,000.00; Payment/receipt_status = Unpaid (and using “Account Payable”)\n• Row “Purchase20231231010” – Amount = 1,250,000.00; Payment/receipt_status = Unpaid (with “Account Payable”)\n• Row “Purchase20231231012” – Amount = 210,000.00; Payment/receipt_status = Unpaid (with “Account Payable”)\n\nAll other Purchase entries we find were already “Paid” (or are recorded as asset, expense, fixed asset etc.) so they do not create outstanding (current) liabilities.\n\nNow, add these amounts:\n 800,000.00 + 750,000.00 = 1,550,000.00  \n 1,550,000.00 + 1,250,000.00 = 2,800,000.00  \n 2,800,000.00 + 210,000.00 = 3,010,000.00  \n\nBecause there are no “Initial” liabilities recorded (all “Initial…” rows are asset deposits or fixed assets) the beginning number is 0.00.\n\nThus, from the data our “current liabilities” only come from the unpaid purchases – a total ending liability of 3,010,000.00.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"3010000.00\"} }",
