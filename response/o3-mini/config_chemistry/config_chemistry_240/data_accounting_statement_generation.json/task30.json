In our table the only rows that “cost” money in the period (and that “appear” on the income statement as expenses) are those whose type starts with “Expense” (regardless of whether the expense is labelled “Administrative,” “Sales” or “Financial”) plus the depreciation line (which also gets included as an expense). (Other “types” such as Purchase, Sale, Initial, Fixed Assets, Interest and Transfer do not “enter” the expenses item.) \n\nThus we peruse the table and add up the “amount” values of all rows where the “type” value begins with either “Expense” or “Depreciation.”\n\nA (step‐by‐step) outline of what we do is as follows (we use the “recorded_amount” which equals “amount” in every row):\n\n1.

In our “step‐by‐step” work we then add all the above amounts. (One may work row‐by‐row; here the running total finally comes to 2,760,290.35.)\n\nThus the final “Total Expenses” figure is 2,760,290.35.\n\nAccordingly, the answer is presented as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Expenses\": \"2760290.35\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis is the final total of the expense transactions in the income statement based on the data provided.",
