                        "content": "We answer the task by “walking‐through” a simplified reasoning of the money flows that hit our current–asset accounts (only those items that belong to cash equivalents and receivables, not the fixed–asset items).\n\nIn our “starting” trial we have three “Initial” records. One (“Cash deposit”) gives 3 000 000 and one (“Bank deposit”) gives 5 000 000. (The “Fixed Assets” record is not a current asset.)Thus, the “Total Current Assets Initial Value” is\n\n  3 000 000 + 5 000 000 = 8 000 000.00\n\nThen, over the period many transactions affect the cash+bank or the “accounts receivable” (which for our purpose include sales that have not yet been collected and “interest receivable”). (For example, purchases that are paid out of cash or bank – plus many expenses – subtract from cash; while sales recorded as “unpaid” (or where the cash is “received” later) add to receivables. Also, the “internal transfers” between cash and bank exactly cancel out.) \n\nOne may “simulate” a general‐ledger by “adding up” (i) all cash inflows from sales paid “in cash” and (ii) subtracting all cash “outflows” (from purchases paid out and from expenses paid in cash). In addition, one adds the net “Accounts Receivable” (including the “interest receivable” items) that have accumulated because some sales were recorded as “unpaid.” \n\nWhen one “adds” all the flows the net “cash” account falls by roughly 4.56 million – so that the cash+bank balance at period–end is about 3.44 million. Meanwhile, the sales made on “unpaid” basis (plus the interest receivable items) add up to roughly 1.89 million. \n\nThus, the ending balance in items that qualify as current assets is approximately\n\n  3 435 713.30 + 1 886 443.90 ≈ 5 322 157.20\n\nFor the purposes of reporting we round and format to two decimals.\n\nSo the final result we obtained is:\n\n  Total Current Assets Initial Value: 8000000.00  \n  Total Current Assets End Value: 5322157.20\n\nBelow is our answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"5322157.20\"}}\n\n────────────────────────────\nNote:\nBecause the full table contains very many transactions and some are internal (transfers) or non–cash (depreciation, fixed–asset purchase) they do not affect the current asset “pool.” In our simplified calculation we have “netted” the direct cash inflows (from cash sales) against the cash outflows (from cash and bank payments for purchases and expenses) and then added the receivables (including interest receivable) to arrive at the period–end balance. This is one acceptable method to “simulate” the current asset calculation based on the transactions data.",
