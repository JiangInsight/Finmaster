In our set the only investing transactions (apart from the “initial” opening entries) are those in which the company bought long‐term operating assets – that is, the “Fixed Assets Purchase” items. (Sales of inventory or operating expenses are not investing activities.) \n\nIn our table we have three such “Fixed Assets Purchase” rows (we ignore the “Initial … Fixed Assets” row because that is simply part of the opening balances):\n\n1. The first Fixed Assets Purchase:\n  Amount = 516936.0 \n  (This is an outflow, so it counts as –516936.0)\n\n2. The second Fixed Assets Purchase:\n  Amount = 491117.63 \n  (Outflow: –491117.63)\n\n3. The third Fixed Assets Purchase:\n  Amount = 585150.04 \n  (Outflow: –585150.04)\n\nNow, summing these three cash outflows:\n  516936.0 + 491117.63 = 1,008,053.63  \n  1,008,053.63 + 585150.04 = 1,593,203.67\n\nBecause these are cash outflows the net cash flow from investing activities is negative:\n  Net Investing Cash Flow = –1,593,203.67\n\nThus, in our final answer we have:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-1593203.67\"\n  }\n}",
