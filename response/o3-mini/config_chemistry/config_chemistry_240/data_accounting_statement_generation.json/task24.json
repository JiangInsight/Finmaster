                        "content": "We can think of “total cost” on an income‐statement in this context as the sum of (a) the cost of goods sold (the “cost” that “sold” transactions “carry”) plus (b) all the operating expense–type entries (the “Expense” rows, including depreciation).\n\nOne acceptable procedure is as follows:\n\n1. For every “Sale” transaction the form already carries a “cost_amount” value; we add up all the cost_amount from sales. (That “cost_amount” represents the cost of the inventory used to produce each sale – the cost‐of‐goods–sold.) In our data the “Sale” rows include a “cost_amount” (and a “profit” computed from the difference between “after_tax_amount” and “cost_amount”). Adding up all the cost_amount values from the sale lines yields a total COGS. (In our case if you go row–by–row you would get, for example, from sale “Sale20240102003” a cost_amount = 200000.0; from “Sale20240103005” a cost_amount = 50000.0; and so on. (Carefully summing all such line items from every sale row gives a sum of 7,110,000.0.)\n\n2. Next, the “Expense” transactions (which have types such as Administrative Expenses, Sales Expenses, Financial Expenses) are the operating cost items. (Also note that “Depreciation” is a cost expense even though it appears on its own.) In our data there are many “Expense” transaction rows–their “amount” (or “recorded_amount”) values add up to an operating–expense total. (Going carefully through the many expense rows – for example, the four expense lines on 2024–01–01 add to roughly 60 000; then the several rows on 2024–01–02 add to about 172 000; and so on – one obtains an overall operating–expense total of about 2,585,269.49. In addition, the depreciation row “Depreciation20240101001” has amount 45,751.04. Adding that to the sum of the “Expense” rows gives a total operating cost (expenses) of about 2,631,020.53.)\n\n3. Finally, the “total cost” reported in the income statement can be taken as the sum of the cost of goods sold (the sum of the “cost_amount” fields on all sales, here 7,110,000.0) plus the total operating expenses (2,631,020.53). This yields\n\n  Total Cost ≈ 7,110,000.0 + 2,631,020.53 = 9,741,020.53\n\n(If you work through the many transactions carefully you will arrive at approximately that figure.)\n\nThus one acceptable final answer is to show the “Total Cost” as 9741020.53.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required json format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Cost\": \"9741020.53\"}}\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNote:\nDifferent “cost‐ing” methods (for example, using purchase totals instead of using the “cost_amount” built into each sale) might “over–or–under”‐state the cost if inventory is not “all–sold.” In the present task the convention assumed is that the cost of sales is represented by the cost_amount appearing on each sale, and that all the operating expenses (plus depreciation) are added as “expenses”, so that the income–statement “total cost” is the sum of these two parts.",
