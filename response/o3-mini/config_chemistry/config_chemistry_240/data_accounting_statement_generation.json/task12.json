                        "content": "We must identify only those transactions that affect the “Accounts Payable” balance. In these records the “Purchase” entries are the ones that add to the liability when they are recorded as unpaid via “Account Payable.” In our list the only purchase records that use payment method “Account Payable” (and whose payment/receipt status is “Unpaid”) are as follows:\n\n1. Purchase20231231002: This purchase is recorded on 2023‑12‑31 for 800,000.0 and is Unpaid with payment method “Account Payable.”  \n2. Purchase20231231004: This purchase (recorded on 2023‑12‑31) is for 750,000.0 and is Unpaid with payment method “Account Payable.”  \n3. Purchase20231231010: This purchase is for 1,250,000.0, is Unpaid and its payment method is “Account Payable.”  \n4. Purchase20231231012: This purchase is for 210,000.0, is Unpaid, and uses “Account Payable.”\n\nNo other initial entry shows an opening accounts payable balance – the “Initial” transactions only deposit cash, bank and fixed asset values. Therefore the beginning (initial) accounts payable balance is zero.\n\nTo determine the ending balance we add together the amounts from the four “Purchase” lines that remain unpaid:\n  800,000.0 + 750,000.0 = 1,550,000.0  \n  1,550,000.0 + 1,250,000.0 = 2,800,000.0  \n  2,800,000.0 + 210,000.0 = 3,010,000.0\n\nThus, the Accounts Payable End Value is 3,010,000.00.\n\nThe final answer is therefore:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"3010000.00\"\n  }\n}",
