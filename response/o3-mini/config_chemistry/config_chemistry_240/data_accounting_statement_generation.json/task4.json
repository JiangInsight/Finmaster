                        "content": "We must “build up” the balances by reading through the list and “picking out” only those posting entries that add to Accounts Receivable. In our books an AR entry is created when there is a sale whose “receive_method” is not (for example) “Cash” but rather an “Account Receivable” in which the customer has not paid immediately. (Often interest receivable transactions are tracked separately.) In our “problem‐to‐solve” rows the only “Accounts Receivable”–type entries show up on Sale transactions with (a) a type “Sale” and (b) a “receive_method” field whose text equals either “Account Receivable” (or a slight misspelling “Account Receviable”). No “Initial” entry creates AR so the beginning AR value is zero.\n\nOne then “sums up” the net receivable (usually using the “after_tax_amount” field) from each sale that uses Account Receivable as its receive_method. (In our example the sample solution shows that starting AR = 0 and the “end‐of‐period AR” is calculated as 2,429,482.13.)\n\nFor our problem we went through the list step–by–step. For example, from the row with id “Sale20240102003” (a Sale with receive_method = “Account Receivable”) we add an after_tax_amount of 213713.18. Then from the next sale row with AR (for instance the “Sale20240103005” that posts an after_tax_amount = 55059.36) we add that amount. Continuing in this way we have (approximately) these AR contributions:\n \n• Sale20240102003: 213,713.18 \n• Sale20240103005: +55,059.36 → 268,772.54 \n• Sale20240103006: +116,891.13 → 385,663.67 \n• Sale20240104008: +33,944.24 → 419,607.91 \n• Sale20240108017: +42,370.61 → 461,978.52 \n• Sale20240109020: +71,802.27 → 533,780.79 \n• Sale20240111025: +628,256.42 → 1,162,037.21 \n• Sale20240114031: +165,833.15 → 1,327,870.36 \n• Sale20240115032: +264,456.82 → 1,592,327.18 \n• Sale20240116035: +107,632.87 → 1,699,960.05 \n• Sale20240117036: +60,365.28 → 1,760,325.33 \n• Sale20240118039: +118,167.27 → 1,878,492.60 \n• Sale20240120044: +259,095.70 → 2,137,588.30 \n• Sale20240121045: +105,934.97 → 2,243,523.27 \n• Sale20240121046: +63,339.20 → 2,306,862.47 \n• Sale20240125051: +66,371.70 → 2,373,234.17\n\nNo other sale in this list is posted with its “receive_method” equal to “Account Receivable” (many sales use “Cash”). Thus the ending AR balance – the balance that will show on the balance‐sheet – is 2,373,234.17.\n\nSo, because no beginning AR entry was recorded the initial value is “0.00”\n\nThe final answer is therefore:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"2373234.17\"\n  }\n}\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the answer, having “reasoned” through the transaction list step–by–step.",
