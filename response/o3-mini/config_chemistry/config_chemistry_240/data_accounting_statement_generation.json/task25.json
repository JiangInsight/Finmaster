(Recall that each “Sale” row has an associated profit number.) \n\nBelow is a brief outline of the process:\n\n1. Identify the rows with \"Sale\" as the type. For each sale row the profit amount is located in the “profit” column.\n2. For example, one sale row “Sale20240102003” has a profit of 24961.24…, “Sale20240103005” has about 7957.22, and so on. (In our table there are many sale rows.)\n3. We then summed the profit numbers from each sale row. The addition of all the profit amounts gives approximately 1,744,991.36.\n4. This resulting value represents the Gross Profit that appears as the “gross profit” item in the income statement.\n\nThus, the final gross profit is approximately 1,744,991.36.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Gross Profit\": \"1744991.36\"\n  }\n}",
