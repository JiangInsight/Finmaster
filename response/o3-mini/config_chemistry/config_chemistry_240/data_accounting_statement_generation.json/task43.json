                        "content": "We must “pick‐out” from the long list only those cash effects that belong to day‐to‐day operations. In our case the idea is to include only actual cash inflows from customers (sales for which “Paid” has been recorded and the “receive_method” is “Cash”) as well as cash payments for operating purchases and operating expenses (for “Purchase” and “Expense” records that were “Paid” in cash). (Items such as “Initial…” deposits, “Fixed Assets…” and “Transfer…” are not operating; further, non‐cash adjustments such as “Depreciation” and “Interest” items that remain “Unpaid” do not affect the operating cash balance.)\n\nOne method to solve is to go transaction–by–transaction. For example, in our data we found items such as:\n\n• A “Purchase20231231001” (a purchase of Chemical Product A) for 190000.0 that was Paid by Bank Transfer (cash outflow).\n• Several “Expense” transactions – for Sales, Administrative and Financial expenses – that when paid in cash (e.g. 15645.37, 37969.92, 6384.43, 40617.90, … etc.) add together to a considerable total cash outflow.\n• Some “Sale” transactions – when the payment/receipt_status is “Paid” and the “receive_method” is “Cash” – produce cash inflows (e.g. +324628.85, +13427.66, +270861.76, +465860.56, +88931.68, … etc.).\n\nAfter “filtering out” types with non‐operating effects (initial deposits, fixed asset purchases, bank/cash transfers, purchases or expenses with “Unpaid” status and interest receivable not collected) and then summing (cash “inflows” minus “outflows”) the running total one obtains a final net operating result. (When one “adds” up all the many “inflows” from sales one gets about 6.33 million; when one “adds” all the many cash “outflows” for purchases and expenses one gets about 9.35 million.)\n\nSubtracting the outflows from the inflows yields:\n  Net operating cash flow = 6,333,895.58 – 9,348,539.31 ≈ –3,014,643.73\n\nThus, the net cash flow from operating activities is about –3,014,643.73.\n\nThe answer below is presented in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-3014643.73\"}}\n```",
