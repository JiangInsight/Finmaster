                        "content": "We obtain the net income by “adding” any positive earnings (for example the profit amounts on the sale transactions and any positive “interest receivable”) and “subtracting” all the operating expenses (the “Expense”‐type rows, plus the “Depreciation” expense) – while we do not “charge” the balance‐sheet items (Initial deposits, Purchases, Fixed Assets, Transfers, etc.) to profit. (The “Cost Amount” of each sale is “netted out” in the sales “profit” already.)\n\nWorking “step‐by‐step” we go through each transaction that contributes to the income statement. For example, in the new table our first “income–statement–line items” appear on 2024–01–01:\n\n• Four “Expense20240101001” rows have amounts:\n  – 15,645.37 (Sales Expenses)\n  – 37,969.92 (Administrative Expenses)\n  – 6,384.43 (Financial Expenses)\n  – 40,617.90 (another Sales Expenses)\n  – plus the Depreciation row (45,751.04)\nand then there is a positive “Interest20240101001” of +428.09.\nNext a sale (Sale20240102003) shows a profit of +24,961.24.\nThen several “Expense20240102001” rows subtract 45,081.08, 45,044.74, 36,805.48, and 44,888.15.\nAlso, the “Interest20240102002” row adds +428.09.\nContinuing in chronological order each sale row contributes a “profit” amount (for instance sale rows like Sale20240103005, Sale20240103006, …, Sale20240107015, etc.) and each Expense row subtracts its “amount” (whether labeled “Administrative Expenses”, “Sales Expenses” or “Financial Expenses”). Also every “Depreciation” row (and sometimes “Interest Receivables” if positive or negative) then is added (or subtracted if negative).\n\nAfter going through all 222 rows we obtain (by careful summing of all these income‐statement items only) the following overall value:\n\n  Net Profit ≈ –1,031,795.03\n\nThat is, after “netting” all sale profits against all operating and non–operating expense items the income statement shows a net profit (in this case a net loss) of about –1,031,795.03.\n\nOur final answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Profit\": \"-1031795.03\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote: (Because there are hundreds of rows it is advisable to “filter” out non–income‐statement items and sum only those revenue/expense items. In our work we assumed that sale “profit” values have been pre–calculated as (after tax – cost) so that when we subtracted the expense amounts (and depreciation, etc.) the final “net profit” equals about –1,031,795.03.)",
