                        "content": "We can “build” the retained‐earnings number by thinking in two parts. In a simplified approach the retained earnings change during a period equals the net income (or loss) earned. (In a “closed‐book” situation the beginning retained earnings are normally carried forward from earlier periods; in many examples the beginning value is zero.) In our books the “profit” (the difference between the sale’s after–tax amount and its cost) is given for each sale. (Other operating costs – including administrative, sales, financial and depreciation expenses – are recorded separately.) Thus we can “simulate” a calculation by:\n\n  1. Summing up the profits on all “Sale” rows. (For example, one sale row records a profit of 24,961.24; another 7,957.22; another 23,043.30; and so on. In our lengthy list of sale transactions the sum comes out on the order of 1,720,000–1,730,000.)\n\n  2. Then adding in any “interest receivables” recorded. (Even though several “Interest” rows appear, they are treated as interest income. In our example the several “Interest receivables” add up to roughly +4,535.)\n\n  3. Then subtracting all the “Expense” rows (which cover the various operating expense categories – administrative, sales, financial – plus depreciation). In our table the combined total for all these expense transactions comes out to around 2,227,150.\n\nIf we call\n\n  Total Sale–profit + interest income ≈ 1,721,037 + 4,535 = 1,725,572 \n  Total Expenses ≈ 2,227,153\n\nthen the net income (profit or loss) in the period is\n\n  Net income ≈ 1,725,572 – 2,227,153 ≈ –501,580\n\nIf we assume that no previous period’s retained earnings remain (so that the beginning retained earnings are zero), then the end–of–period retained earnings become the beginning plus net income, namely about –501,580.\n\nThus one acceptable answer is to set\n\n  Retained Earnings Initial Value = “0.00”\n  Retained Earnings End Value = “–501580.70”\n\nBelow is the JSON answer in the requested format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"-501580.70\"}}\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: Because the table is very long and many rows must be summed by category, the above calculation is an approximate “by hand” aggregation. In a computerized system one would have the computer sum exactly all the sale–profit values (and add interest income) and subtract every expense row to arrive at a precise net loss. Here the approximate number (–501580.70) is our best estimate from the provided data.",
