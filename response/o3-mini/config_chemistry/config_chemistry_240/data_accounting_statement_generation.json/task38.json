                        "content": "We must “reverse‐think” the effect that sales on credit have on cash. In a cash flow statement the “increase in accounts receivable” means that although the firm “sold” goods, it did not collect cash and so the change (an increase) is subtracted from cash. In our task we need to sum up all the “Sale” transactions whose “receive_method” is “Account Receviable” – that is, these sales did not immediately bring cash in. (There is no “collection” transaction in these data that reduces AR.) Then, when reporting the final “(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable” item in the operating section of the cash flow statement the net effect is shown with a minus sign (because an increase in AR reduces cash).\n\nStep 1. Identify the sales that affect AR. In our (big) table the rows that have type “Sale” with the “receive_method” equal to “Account Receviable” are as follows. (The “after_tax_amount” column is interpreted as the real amount that will be received later from the customer.)\n\n• Sale20240102003 – after_tax_amount = 213,713.18  \n• Sale20240103005 – after_tax_amount = 55,059.36 (note: from the row the “after_tax_amount” is given as 55,059.36)  \n• Sale20240103006 – after_tax_amount = 116,891.13  \n• Sale20240104008 – after_tax_amount = 33,944.24  \n• Sale20240108017 – after_tax_amount = 42,370.61  \n• Sale20240109020 – after_tax_amount = 71,802.27  \n• Sale20240111025 – after_tax_amount = 628,256.42  \n• Sale20240114031 – after_tax_amount = 165,833.15  \n• Sale20240115032 – after_tax_amount = 264,456.82  \n• Sale20240116035 – after_tax_amount = 107,632.87  \n• Sale20240117036 – after_tax_amount = 60,365.28  \n• Sale20240118039 – after_tax_amount = 118,167.27  \n• Sale20240120044 – after_tax_amount = 259,095.70  \n• Sale20240121045 – after_tax_amount = 105,934.97  \n• Sale20240121046 – after_tax_amount = 63,339.20  \n• Sale20240125051 – after_tax_amount = 66,371.70  \n\nStep 2. Sum these “after‑tax” amounts to obtain the change in AR:\n • 213,713.18  \n + 55,059.36 = 268,772.54  \n + 116,891.13 = 385,663.67  \n + 33,944.24 = 419,607.91  \n + 42,370.61 = 461,978.52  \n + 71,802.27 = 533,780.79  \n + 628,256.42 = 1,162,037.21  \n + 165,833.15 = 1,327,870.36  \n + 264,456.82 = 1,592,327.18  \n + 107,632.87 = 1,699,960.05  \n + 60,365.28 = 1,760,325.33  \n + 118,167.27 = 1,878,492.60  \n + 259,095.70 = 2,137,588.30  \n + 105,934.97 = 2,243,523.27  \n + 63,339.20 = 2,306,862.47  \n + 66,371.70 = 2,373,234.17  \n\nThus, our net “increase” (i.e. the AR balance went up by 2,373,234.17). However, in the cash flow statement an increase in an asset results in a subtraction. Therefore, the final entry is reported as –2,373,234.17.\n\nStep 3. Provide the answer in the required JSON format.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-2373234.17'} }",
