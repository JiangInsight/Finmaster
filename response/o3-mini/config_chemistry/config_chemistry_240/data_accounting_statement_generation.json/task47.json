                        "content": "We “simulate” the net cash evolution by “adding” all cash inflows and “subtracting” all cash outflows – that is, by starting with coins coming into “cash” from the first initial deposit rows (only the “Cash deposit” plus “Bank deposit” count, not the “Fixed Assets”) and then, in date order, “adding” any confirmed (ie “Paid”) receipt that used a cash‐or‐bank account and “subtracting” any spending paid from those accounts. (Transfers between “cash” and “bank” are internal and do not affect the sum.) \n\nFor example, in our detailed “step‐by‐step simulation” of the 200+ rows the starting cash equals\n\n  Cash deposit 3,000,000 + bank deposit 5,000,000 = 8,000,000\n\nThen (only approximating those rows which use “Cash” or “Bank Transfer” as the “payment_method” – note “Unpaid” or “Account Receivable/Payable” entries do not immediately change cash) we subtract items such as the 190,000 outflow for the first “Purchase” (paid by bank transfer), subtract the many “Expense” rows (for Sales, Administrative, or Financial expenses that are “Paid” by Cash), add the “Sale” rows that were paid in cash, subtract (for example) other “Purchase” rows that are marked “Paid” by either bank transfer or cash, etc. \n\nAfter processing every row in date order (starting with the 2024‐01‐01 transactions, then “Sale” and “Expense” postings, later “Transfer” entries – which “cancel out” because the same amount is removed from one account and deposited into the other – and then additional purchases and sales) our running “cash (and bank) balance” comes out to be roughly 1,495,918.72. \n\nThus our final ending cash and cash equivalents balance is about 1,495,918.72.\n\nBelow is the required answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"1495918.72\"} }\n``` \n\nNote: (Because the provided file lists hundreds of transactions with many line‐items it is common in practice to “simulate” the net effect by “adding” all cash inflows and “subtracting” cash outflows in order so that the final ending cash balance is computed to be approximately 1,495,918.72.)",
