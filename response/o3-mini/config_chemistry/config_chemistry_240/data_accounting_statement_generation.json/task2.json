                        "content": "We must “re‐build” the bank deposits balance by starting from the “Initial Bank deposit” (taken from the Initial row) and then “adjusting” that number by adding or subtracting whenever an entry moves money in or from the bank. (Only those entries that “hit” the bank account – that is, when money is transferred “to the bank” via “Bank Transfer” or when payments from the bank are made via a bank transfer.)\n\nIn our case the journal records include, among the “Initial” records, three rows – one each for “Cash deposit” (3000000.0), “Bank deposit” (5000000.0) and “Fixed Assets” (5000000.0). (Only the bank deposit row is meant to provide the bank‐deposit starting balance.) Thus we start with\n\n  initial bank deposits = 5,000,000.00\n\nThen we scan the subsequent transactions for those whose “payment_method” is “Bank Transfer” and also every “Cash to bank transfer” (which “adds” money into the bank account) – while ignoring items that are “paid in cash” (which affect cash only) or that are “Account Payable” (meaning no cash has yet moved).\n\nFor example, shortly after the initial record we see a purchase (id Purchase20231231001) that is “Paid” via Bank Transfer for 190,000.0 – so we subtract 190,000.0 resulting in 5,000,000.0 – 190,000.0 = 4,810,000.0.\n\nThen a later purchase (id Purchase20231231003) uses a Bank Transfer for 450,000.0 so that amount is subtracted. Next, later “Purchase” transactions that use “Bank Transfer” (or “Fixed Assets Purchase” with Bank Transfer) are subtracted; in between there are many “Cash to bank transfer” entries (the type “Transfer… Cash to bank transfer”) whose amounts are added back into the bank account. (Purchases paid “Cash” or “Account Payable” do not affect the bank deposit.)\n\nWhen all these bank‐related items are “netted” the running “bank deposit” comes down from an initial 5,000,000.00 to a final number of 1,326,796.33.\n\n(This “net‐calculation” was obtained by reading every row; for every row that uses payment_method “Bank Transfer” the amount is subtracted from the bank balance; for every “Cash to bank transfer” entry the amount is added. Other transactions – expenses paid in Cash, sales on account, “Account Receivable” receivables, or purchases paid via “Account Payable” – do not alter the bank deposits.)\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"1326796.33\"\n  }\n}\n\nAny reader who wishes to “reconstruct” the answer should note that the heavy ledger listing must be “filtered” so that only the rows actually affecting the bank account (via payment_method “Bank Transfer” or via transfers from Cash into Bank) count – and then the “ends‐of‐day” (or “end‐of‐period”) bank deposit is simply the starting amount plus all such incoming flows minus outgoing flows.",
