                        "content": "We can “create” a “liabilities” balance by adding up all amounts from transactions that result in an “obligation” – typically when a purchase is made on credit (that is marked “Unpaid” and (usually) carried on the “Account Payable” side).\n\nIn our input data the only transactions that create a liability are those “Purchase” records that have a payment/receipt status of “Unpaid” (and—in our data—their payment_method is “Account Payable”). (The “Initial” entries are “asset” startup entries and expenses and sales do not “create” an obligation.)\n\nLet’s scan the data (by the “id” field) to pick out those “Purchase” transactions that are unpaid:\n\n1. Row 5 – id “Purchase20231231002”: type Purchase, amount = 800000.0, status = Unpaid (payment_method “Account Payable”).  \n2. Row 27 – id “Purchase20231231004”: type Purchase, amount = 750000.0, status = Unpaid (payment_method “Account Payable”).  \n3. Row 92 – id “Purchase20231231010”: type Purchase, amount = 1250000.0, status = Unpaid (payment_method “Account Payable”).  \n4. Row 111 – id “Purchase20231231012”: type Purchase, amount = 210000.0, status = Unpaid (payment_method “Account Payable”).\n\nAll other “Purchase” transactions are either marked “Paid” (so they have already been settled) or are not on credit.\n\nNow we sum these “unpaid” amounts:\n  800000.0 + 750000.0 = 1550000.0  \n  1550000.0 + 1250000.0 = 2800000.0  \n  2800000.0 + 210000.0 = 3010000.0\n\nBecause no initial transactions record a beginning liability (they are all asset-related “Initial” entries) the “Total Liabilities Initial Value” is 0.00.\n\nThus the ending total liabilities equal 3,010,000.00.\n\nAccordingly, our answer is:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"3010000.00\"} }\n```",
