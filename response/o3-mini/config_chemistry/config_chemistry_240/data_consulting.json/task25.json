Calculate Debt to Equity Ratio  \n• From the balance sheet, Total Owner’s Equity = 11,657,959.24  \n• Total Liabilities can be derived as:  \n  Total Liabilities = Total Assets – Total Owner’s Equity  \n  = 15,086,049.65 – 11,657,959.24  \n  = 3,428,090.41  \n• Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity  \n  = 3,428,090.41 / 11,657,959.24  \n  ≈ 0.29\n\nStep 2. Calculate Net Profit Margin  \n• From the income statement, Net Profit = –1,342,040.76 and Total Revenue = 8,361,807.77  \n• Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100  \n  = (–1,342,040.76 / 8,361,807.77) × 100  \n  ≈ –16.05%\n\nStep 3. Calculate Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n• From the cash flow statement, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –4,900,875.61 and Total Current Liabilities = 3,428,090.41  \n• Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities  \n  = –4,900,875.61 / 3,428,090.41  \n  ≈ –1.43\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.29\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"-16.05%\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.43\"\n  }\n}",
