In this problem, the cash and cash equivalents are taken as the ending amounts of Cash on Hand plus Bank Deposits. Using the data in the balance sheet:\n\n• Cash on Hand (End_amount): 1,379,124.39  \n• Bank Deposits (End_amount): 126,796.33  \n\nThus, ending cash and cash equivalents = 1,379,124.39 + 126,796.33 = 1,505,920.72\n\nThe Total Current Liabilities is provided as 3,428,090.41.\n\nNow, the Cash to Current Debt Ratio is calculated as:\n\n  Cash to Current Debt Ratio = (Cash and Cash Equivalents) ÷ (Total Current Liabilities)  \n    = 1,505,920.72 ÷ 3,428,090.41 ≈ 0.4394\n\nRounded to two decimal places, this ratio is approximately 0.44.\n\nThus, the solution in the required format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"0.44\"\n  }\n}",
