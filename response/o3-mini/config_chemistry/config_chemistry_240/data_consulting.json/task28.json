Here:\n  Total Liabilities = 15086049.65 – 11657959.24 = 3428090.41\n  Total Assets = 15086049.65\n• Thus, Debt to Asset Ratio = 3428090.41 / 15086049.65 ≈ 0.2273, which rounds to 0.23.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Gross Profit Margin.\n• From the income statement, Gross Profit = 1641807.77 and Total Revenue = 8361807.77.\n• Thus, Gross Profit Margin = 1641807.77 / 8361807.77 ≈ 0.1963. Expressed as a percentage, this becomes approximately 19.63%.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n• From the cash flow statement, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –4900875.61.\n• From the balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities = 3428090.41.\n• Thus, Operating Cash Flow Ratio = –4900875.61 / 3428090.41 ≈ –1.43.\n\nThe final solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.23\", \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"19.63%\", \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.43\"}}",
