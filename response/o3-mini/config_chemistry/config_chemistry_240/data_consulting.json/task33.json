                        "content": "We first identify the necessary numbers from the provided statements and then compute each ratio as explained below.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n • Operating Cash Flow is given by “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities” = –4,900,875.61  \n • Current Liabilities are “Total Current Liabilities” = 3,428,090.41  \n • Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities = –4,900,875.61 / 3,428,090.41 ≈ –1.43  \n\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \n • Here the “Debt” is interpreted as current liabilities. So, the ratio uses the same numbers as above.  \n • Ratio = –4,900,875.61 / 3,428,090.41 ≈ –1.43  \n\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio  \n • The formula is: Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  \n • Since the beginning inventory is 0 and the ending inventory is 4,530,000.00, the average inventory = (0 + 4,530,000.00) / 2 = 2,265,000.00  \n • Cost of Goods Sold = 6,720,000.00  \n • Ratio = 6,720,000.00 / 2,265,000.00 ≈ 2.97  \n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n • This ratio is computed as Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity. In our case, “Total Liabilities” is the current liabilities (since only current liabilities are provided) = 3,428,090.41, and “Total Owner's Equity” = 11,657,959.24  \n • Ratio = 3,428,090.41 / 11,657,959.24 ≈ 0.29  \n\n5. Quick Ratio  \n • Quick Assets = Total Current Assets minus Inventory.  \n • Total Current Assets = 8,538,597.02 and Inventory = 4,530,000.00  \n • Quick Assets = 8,538,597.02 – 4,530,000.00 = 4,008,597.02  \n • Ratio = Quick Assets / Total Current Liabilities = 4,008,597.02 / 3,428,090.41 ≈ 1.17  \n\n6. Current Ratio  \n • Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities = 8,538,597.02 / 3,428,090.41 ≈ 2.49  \n\nThus, the computed ratios are as follows:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.43\", \n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-1.43\", \n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"2.97\", \n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.29\", \n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.17\", \n    \"Current Ratio\": \"2.49\"\n  }\n}",
