                        "content": "Let's work through each ratio step by step:\n\n1. Current Ratio  \n   = (Total Current Assets) / (Total Current Liabilities)  \n   = 8,538,597.02 / 3,428,090.41  \n   ≈ 2.49\n\n2. Gross Profit Margin  \n   = (Gross Profit) / (Total Revenue) × 100%  \n   = (1,641,807.77) / (8,361,807.77) × 100%  \n   ≈ 19.63%\n\n3. Debt to Asset Ratio  \n   Total Liabilities can be calculated as:  \n   = Total Assets – Total Owner's Equity  \n   = 15,086,049.65 – 11,657,959.24  \n   = 3,428,090.41  \n   Ratio = 3,428,090.41 / 15,086,049.65  \n   ≈ 0.23\n\n4. Net Profit Margin  \n   = (Net Profit) / (Total Revenue) × 100%  \n   = (-1,342,040.76) / (8,361,807.77) × 100%  \n   ≈ -16.05%\n\n5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio  \n   From the cash flow statement, the Ending Balance for Cash and Cash Equivalents is 1,505,920.72.  \n   = 1,505,920.72 / 3,428,090.41  \n   ≈ 0.44\n\n6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)  \n   FCF is calculated as:  \n   = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) – (Capital Expenditure)  \n   Here, the Purchase of Fixed Assets (capex) is 1,593,203.67 (cash outflow) and the operating cash flow is –4,900,875.61.  \n   Thus, FCF = –4,900,875.61 – 1,593,203.67  \n   = –6,494,079.28\n\n7. Return on Assets (ROA)  \n   = (Net Profit) / (Total Assets) × 100%  \n   = (–1,342,040.76) / (15,086,049.65) × 100%  \n   ≈ –8.90%\n\nNow, presenting the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"2.49\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"19.63%\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.23\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"-16.05%\",\n    \"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"0.44\",\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-6494079.28\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"-8.90%\"\n  }\n}",
