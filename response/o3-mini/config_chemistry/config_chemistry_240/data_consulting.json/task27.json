                        "content": "We first extract and compute the necessary figures from the three statements.\n\nStep 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio  \n• From the cash‐flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is –4,900,875.61.  \n• From the income statement, the Net Profit is –1,342,040.76.  \n• Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Net Profit)  \n  = (–4,900,875.61) / (–1,342,040.76)  \n  ≈ 3.65  \n\nStep 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio  \nThe turnover ratio is defined as Revenue divided by the average current assets.  \n• From the income statement, the Main Business Revenue = 8,361,807.77.  \n• From the balance sheet, the current assets at the beginning is 8,000,000.00 and at the end is 8,538,597.02.  \n• The average current assets = (8,000,000.00 + 8,538,597.02) / 2  \n  = 16,538,597.02 / 2  \n  = 8,269,298.51  \n• Ratio = Revenue / Average Current Assets  \n  ≈ 8,361,807.77 / 8,269,298.51  \n  ≈ 1.01  \n\nStep 3. Quick Ratio  \nQuick ratio is calculated as “Quick Assets” divided by “Current Liabilities.” Quick Assets include cash on hand, bank deposits, interest receivable, and accounts receivable (i.e. current assets excluding inventory).  \n• From the balance sheet at end date,  \n  Cash on Hand = 1,379,124.39  \n  Bank Deposits = 126,796.33  \n  Interest Receivable = 4,535.06  \n  Accounts Receivable = 2,498,141.24  \n• Sum of quick assets = 1,379,124.39 + 126,796.33 + 4,535.06 + 2,498,141.24  \n  = 4,008,597.02  \n• Current Liabilities (end) are given by:  \n  Accounts Payable = 3,010,000.00  \n  Taxes Payable = 418,090.41  \n  Total Current Liabilities = 3,010,000.00 + 418,090.41 = 3,428,090.41  \n• Quick Ratio = 4,008,597.02 / 3,428,090.41  \n  ≈ 1.17  \n\nThus, the final results are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"3.65\",\n    \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"1.01\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.17\"\n  }\n}",
