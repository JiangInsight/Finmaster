                        "content": "We begin by noting the ending data from the three statements. For convenience, we use the “end‐” values (unless otherwise noted) and compute averages when needed.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n • Operating cash flow (from operating activities): –4,900,875.61  \n • Total current liabilities: 3,428,090.41  \n • Ratio = (–4,900,875.61) ÷ 3,428,090.41 ≈ –1.43\n\n2. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n • In this balance sheet the only liabilities given are the current ones = 3,428,090.41  \n • Owner’s equity (end): 11,657,959.24  \n • Ratio = 3,428,090.41 ÷ 11,657,959.24 ≈ 0.29\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n • Total revenue (from income statement): 8,361,807.77  \n • Total assets (end): 15,086,049.65  \n • Ratio = 8,361,807.77 ÷ 15,086,049.65 ≈ 0.55\n\n4. Quick Ratio  \n • Current assets (end): 8,538,597.02  \n • Inventory (end): 4,530,000.00, so “quick assets” = 8,538,597.02 – 4,530,000.00 = 4,008,597.02  \n • Current liabilities: 3,428,090.41  \n • Ratio = 4,008,597.02 ÷ 3,428,090.41 ≈ 1.17\n\n5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n • This is the same as “operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio”  \n • So the ratio is –1.43\n\n6. Return on Equity (ROE)  \n • We use the average owner’s equity.  \n  – Beginning owner’s equity: 13,000,000.00  \n  – Ending owner’s equity: 11,657,959.24  \n  – Average = (13,000,000.00 + 11,657,959.24) ÷ 2 ≈ 12,328,979.62  \n • Net profit (from income statement): –1,342,040.76  \n • ROE = (–1,342,040.76) ÷ 12,328,979.62 ≈ –0.1088, i.e. –10.88%\n\n7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n • Accounts receivable (end): 2,498,141.24  \n • Revenue: 8,361,807.77  \n • Ratio = 8,361,807.77 ÷ 2,498,141.24 ≈ 3.35\n\nWe now present the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.43\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.29\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.55\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.17\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.43\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"-10.88%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.35\"\n  }\n}",
