Identify the required items from the statements:\n\n• From the Cash Flow Statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is reported as –4,900,875.61.\n\n• From the Balance Sheet, the Total Current Liabilities (i.e. Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable) at the end date is 3,428,090.41.\n\nStep 2. Use the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio formula:\n  Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt\n\nHere, using Total Current Liabilities as the measure of debt, we have:\n  Ratio = –4,900,875.61 / 3,428,090.41\n\nStep 3. Calculate the ratio:\n  Ratio ≈ –1.43\n\nThus, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately –1.43.\n\nFinal answer in the requested format:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-1.43\"}}",
