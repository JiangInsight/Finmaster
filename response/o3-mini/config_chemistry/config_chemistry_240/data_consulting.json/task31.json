                        "content": "We need to compute the following ratios using the information from the three statements. In our calculations, we assume the following standard definitions:\n\n1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue ÷ Average Accounts Receivable  \n  • Because the beginning balance for Accounts Receivable (on 2023‑12‑31) is zero and the ending balance is provided, the average is:  \n   Average AR = (0 + Ending AR) ÷ 2  \n  • Then, the ratio = Total Revenue ÷ (Ending AR ÷ 2)\n\n2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio (and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio) = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities ÷ Total Current Liabilities  \n  • (In the given sample both these items were the same.)\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue ÷ Average Total Assets  \n  • Here, Average Total Assets = (Total Assets beginning + Total Assets ending) ÷ 2\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities ÷ Total Owner’s Equity  \n  • Total Liabilities can be computed as: (Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity) − (Total Owner’s Equity)\n\nNow, step‑by‑step, we compute each ratio for the provided problem:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nStep 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n• Ending Accounts Receivable = 2,498,141.24  \n• Average AR = (0 + 2,498,141.24) ÷ 2 = 1,249,070.62  \n• Total Revenue (from the income statement) = 8,361,807.77  \n• Ratio = 8,361,807.77 ÷ 1,249,070.62 ≈ 6.691, which rounds to 6.69\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nStep 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n• Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –4,900,875.61  \n• Total Current Liabilities (from the balance sheet) = 3,428,090.41  \n• Ratio = –4,900,875.61 ÷ 3,428,090.41 ≈ –1.4296, which rounds to –1.43  \n(This ratio applies to both keys.)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nStep 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n• Total Assets at beginning = 13,000,000.00  \n• Total Assets at end = 15,086,049.65  \n• Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 15,086,049.65) ÷ 2 = 14,043,024.825  \n• Total Revenue = 8,361,807.77  \n• Ratio = 8,361,807.77 ÷ 14,043,024.825 ≈ 0.595, which rounds to 0.60\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nStep 4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n• Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity at end = 15,086,049.65  \n• Total Owner’s Equity at end = 11,657,959.24  \n• Hence, Total Liabilities = 15,086,049.65 – 11,657,959.24 = 3,428,090.41  \n• Ratio = 3,428,090.41 ÷ 11,657,959.24 ≈ 0.294, which rounds to 0.29\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format, we have:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"6.69\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-1.43\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.43\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.60\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.29\"\n  }\n}",
