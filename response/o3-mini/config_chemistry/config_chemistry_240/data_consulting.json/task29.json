                        "content": "Let's walk through the calculations step by step.\n\n1. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n   From the balance sheet, Total Liabilities can be derived by subtracting Owner's Equity from Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity.  \n   • Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity = 15,086,049.65  \n   • Owner's Equity (End) = 11,657,959.24  \n   Thus, Total Liabilities = 15,086,049.65 – 11,657,959.24 = 3,428,090.41  \n   Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Owner's Equity = 3,428,090.41 / 11,657,959.24 ≈ 0.29  \n\n2. Net Profit Margin  \n   Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100  \n   • Net Profit = –1,342,040.76  \n   • Total Revenue = 8,361,807.77  \n   Calculation: (–1,342,040.76 / 8,361,807.77) × 100 ≈ –16.05%  \n\n3. Return on Assets (ROA)  \n   ROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) × 100  \n   • Net Profit = –1,342,040.76  \n   • Total Assets (End) = 15,086,049.65  \n   Calculation: (–1,342,040.76 / 15,086,049.65) × 100 ≈ –8.89%  \n\n4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n   This ratio measures how many times receivables are collected during the period.  \n   Formula: Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n   • Accounts Receivable (Initial) = 0.00  \n   • Accounts Receivable (End) = 2,498,141.24  \n   Average Accounts Receivable = (0.00 + 2,498,141.24) / 2 = 1,249,070.62  \n   Calculation: 8,361,807.77 / 1,249,070.62 ≈ 6.69  \n\nThus, the final solutions are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.29\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"-16.05%\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"-8.89%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"6.69\"\n  }\n}",
