Calculate Free Cash Flow (FCF)  \n• From the Cash Flow statement, Free Cash Flow is obtained by adding Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities and Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities.  \n• In this problem:  \n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –5,394,333.52  \n  Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = –2,265,288.42  \n• Therefore, FCF = –5,394,333.52 + (–2,265,288.42) = –7,659,621.94  \n\nStep 2. Calculate the Current Assets Turnover Ratio  \n• The Current Assets Turnover Ratio is calculated as:  \n  Total Revenue / Average Current Assets  \n• The income statement shows Total Revenue = 7,099,920.95  \n• From the Balance Sheet, the Total Current Assets are provided for two dates:  \n  Beginning (Initial Date) = 8,000,000.00  \n  Ending (End Date) = 7,660,411.14  \n• The Average Current Assets = (8,000,000.00 + 7,660,411.14) / 2 = 7,830,205.57 (approximately)  \n• Therefore, Current Assets Turnover Ratio = 7,099,920.95 / 7,830,205.57 ≈ 0.91  \n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-7659621.94\",\n    \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.91\"\n  }\n}",
