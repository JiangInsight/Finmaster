Determine Debt to Asset Ratio.\n • Total Liabilities is given by Total Current Liabilities (which equals Total Liabilities here) = 3,054,996.05.\n • Total Assets at period end = 14,879,933.86.\n • Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets = 3,054,996.05 / 14,879,933.86 ≈ 0.2053. Rounding to two decimals, we report 0.21.\n\nStep 2. Determine Gross Profit Margin.\n • From the income statement, Gross Profit = 1,559,920.95 and Total Revenue = 7,099,920.95.\n • Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100 = (1,559,920.95 / 7,099,920.95) × 100 ≈ 21.99%.\n • Rounding to two decimal places, we have 22.00%.\n\nStep 3. Determine Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n • From the cash flow statement, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = −5,394,333.52.\n • Current Liabilities (from the balance sheet) = 3,054,996.05.\n • Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities = −5,394,333.52 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ −1.765.\n • Rounding to two decimals, this ratio is −1.77.\n\nThus, the final answers are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.21\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"22.00%\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.77\"\n  }\n}",
