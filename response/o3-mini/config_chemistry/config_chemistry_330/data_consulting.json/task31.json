                        "content": "We need to calculate the following ratios:\n\n1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:\n • Formula: Main Business Revenue / (Average Accounts Receivable)\n • Because the beginning Accounts Receivable is 0 and the ending value is provided, the average is (0 + End_amount) / 2.\n • Here, Main Business Revenue = 7,099,920.95 and Accounts Receivable (end) = 3,558,301.64.\n  Average Accounts Receivable = 3,558,301.64 / 2 = 1,779,150.82.\n  Thus, AR turnover = 7,099,920.95 / 1,779,150.82 ≈ 3.99.\n\n2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio (and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio):\n • Both ratios use the operating cash flow divided by total current liabilities.\n • From the cash flow statement, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –5,394,333.52.\n • From the balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities = 3,054,996.05.\n  Ratio = –5,394,333.52 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ –1.77.\n • (Thus, operating cash flow ratio and operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio are both –1.77.)\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio:\n • Formula: Main Business Revenue / (Average Total Assets)\n • Average Total Assets = (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2.\n  Beginning Total Assets = 13,000,000.00 and Ending Total Assets = 14,879,933.86.\n  Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 14,879,933.86) / 2 ≈ 13,939,966.93.\n  Thus, Total Asset Turnover Ratio = 7,099,920.95 / 13,939,966.93 ≈ 0.51.\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio:\n • Formula: Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity.\n • In our balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities are 3,054,996.05, and there is no additional non‐current liability given, so total liabilities ≈ 3,054,996.05.\n • Total Owner's Equity (end) = 11,824,937.81.\n  Thus, Debt to Equity Ratio = 3,054,996.05 / 11,824,937.81 ≈ 0.26.\n\nNow we present the results in the required JSON format:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.99', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-1.77', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.77', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.51', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.26'}}",
