                        "content": "We start by computing each ratio using the figures provided in the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement.\n\nStep 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n• First, determine the total liabilities. In this problem the liabilities come from the balance sheet items “Accounts Payable” and “Taxes Payable”. (Note that Total Liabilities = Total Assets – Total Owner’s Equity.)\n  Total Assets (end) = 14,879,933.86  \n  Total Owner’s Equity (end) = 11,824,937.81  \n  Total Liabilities = 14,879,933.86 – 11,824,937.81 = 3,054,996.05\n\n• Now, compute the Debt to Asset Ratio:\n  Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities ÷ Total Assets  \n  = 3,054,996.05 ÷ 14,879,933.86 ≈ 0.2053  \nRounding to two decimal places gives ≈ 0.21\n\nStep 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n• Using the cash flow statement:\n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –5,394,333.52  \n  And from the income statement, Net Profit = –1,175,062.19\n\n• Since both values are negative, their ratio is positive:\n  Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = (–5,394,333.52) ÷ (–1,175,062.19)  \n  = 5,394,333.52 ÷ 1,175,062.19 ≈ 4.59\n\nThus, the final answers are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.21\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"4.59\"\n  }\n}",
