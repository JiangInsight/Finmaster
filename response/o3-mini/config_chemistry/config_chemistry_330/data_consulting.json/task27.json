                        "content": "We first extract the necessary numbers from the provided statements and then compute the ratios step by step.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nFrom the cash flow statement and income statement, we have:  \n • Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –5,394,333.52  \n • Net Profit = –1,175,062.19\n\nIn calculating the ratio we use absolute values (as seen in the example) so that:\n Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = |–5,394,333.52| / |–1,175,062.19|  \n   = 5,394,333.52 / 1,175,062.19 ≈ 4.59\n\n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\nThis ratio is defined as Total Revenue divided by the Average Current Assets. We assume the “Total Current Assets” provided in the balance sheet are for period end and beginning.\n\n• Beginning Current Assets = 8,000,000.00  \n• Ending Current Assets = 7,660,411.14  \n• Average Current Assets = (8,000,000.00 + 7,660,411.14) / 2 = 7,830,205.57\n\nFrom the income statement:  \n • Total Revenue = 7,099,920.95\n\nThus, the ratio = 7,099,920.95 / 7,830,205.57 ≈ 0.91\n\n3. Quick Ratio\n\nThe Quick Ratio is typically given by:  \n Quick Ratio = (Current Assets – Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet (ending amounts):  \n • Total Current Assets = 7,660,411.14  \n • Inventory = 3,760,000.00  \n • Therefore, Quick Assets = 7,660,411.14 – 3,760,000.00 = 3,900,411.14  \n • Total Current Liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n\nThus, Quick Ratio = 3,900,411.14 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ 1.28\n\nThe final answers are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"4.59\",\n    \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.91\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.28\"\n  }\n}",
