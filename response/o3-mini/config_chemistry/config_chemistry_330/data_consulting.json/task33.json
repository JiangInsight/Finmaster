                        "content": "We first extract the necessary data from the statements. For the balance sheet (end amounts as of 2024-01-29), we have:\n\n• Current Assets = 7,660,411.14  \n  – Cash on Hand = 145,666.48  \n  – Bank Deposits = 194,711.58  \n  – Interest Receivable = 1,731.44  \n  – Accounts Receivable = 3,558,301.64  \n  – Inventory = 3,760,000.00  \n\n• Current Liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n\n• Total Owner’s Equity = 11,824,937.81\n\nFor the Cash Flow statement, note that:\n• Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -5,394,333.52\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n• Cost of Goods Sold = 5,540,000.00\n\nAlso note that for several ratios (when there is no beginning inventory provided) we assume the beginning inventory is zero.\n\nNow, we compute the ratios step by step:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n  = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n  = -5,394,333.52 / 3,054,996.05  \n  ≈ -1.77\n\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \n  Here “Debt” is interpreted as current liabilities (there is no separate non‐current debt provided). Thus,  \n  = -5,394,333.52 / 3,054,996.05  \n  ≈ -1.77\n\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio  \n  The formula we use is: Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory.  \n  Since beginning inventory = 0 and ending inventory = 3,760,000.00,  \n  Average Inventory = (0 + 3,760,000) / 2 = 1,880,000.00  \n  Then, Inventory Turnover Ratio = 5,540,000.00 / 1,880,000.00  \n  ≈ 2.95\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n  = Current Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity  \n  = 3,054,996.05 / 11,824,937.81  \n  ≈ 0.26\n\n5. Quick Ratio  \n  = (Current Assets – Inventory) / Current Liabilities  \n  = (7,660,411.14 – 3,760,000.00) / 3,054,996.05  \n  = 3,900,411.14 / 3,054,996.05  \n  ≈ 1.28\n\n6. Current Ratio  \n  = Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \n  = 7,660,411.14 / 3,054,996.05  \n  ≈ 2.51\n\nThus, our solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.77\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-1.77\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"2.95\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.26\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.28\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"2.51\"\n  }\n}",
