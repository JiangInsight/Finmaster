All “Sale” transactions were summed (using their “after_tax_amount”) to yield a Main Business Revenue of 6,936,375.28. Adding positive interest‐earning “Interest Receivables” (net 1,735.58) gives Total Revenue of 6,938,110.86.\n2. The cost side was computed by summing the “cost_amount” on all sale rows (totaling 5,700,000.00) which is taken as the Cost of Goods Sold (and Total Cost).\n3. Gross Profit is Revenue less COGS, i.e. 6,936,375.28 – 5,700,000.00 = 1,236,375.28.\n4. Operating expenses were grouped from the detailed “Expense” rows – separately adding up Administrative Expenses (≈1,264,715.46), Selling Expenses (≈364,894.23), Depreciation (≈45,765.70) and Financial Expenses (≈420,720.75). Their sum gives Total Expenses of 2,096,096.14.\n5. Then Profit Before Tax is Gross Profit minus Total Expenses plus Interest Income, yielding –857,985.28.\n6. Assuming a tax rate of roughly 20% (as illustrated in the sample problem) on the absolute value of the loss, Tax Expense calculates to 171,597.06. Finally, subtracting Tax Expense from Profit Before Tax yields a Net Profit (loss) of –1,029,582.34.\nThe numbers have been rounded to two decimals.\n",
