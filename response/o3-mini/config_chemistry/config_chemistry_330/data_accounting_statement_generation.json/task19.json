(This net income is “given” by the aggregate profit amounts that appear on every “Sale” row; in our example the sale lines’ profit amounts add up roughly to 1,602,500.30.) \n\nThus, when no other items are “separately” added or subtracted from the liabilities‐and–owners equity section—and since many transactions (such as purchases that are “paid” or “unpaid,” expense, transfers, etc.) already have been “net‐effected” in the operating outcome—the final balance is computed as\n\n  Final Liabilities and Owners Equity = Initial capital + net profit \n              = 13,000,000.00 + 1,602,500.30 \n              ≈ 14,602,500.30\n\nThat is we say:\n\n• Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value = 13,000,000.00  \n• Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value = 14,602,500.30\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value': '14602500.30'}}",
