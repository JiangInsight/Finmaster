                        "content": "We must “close‐out” the profit (that is, the net income over the period) into retained earnings. In these records the only “income” comes from the “Sale” transactions (each of which already lists a “profit” amount) and the “interest receivables” (recorded as positive amounts) while the many “Expense” entries (including administrative, sales, financial, and depreciation expenses) work against that total profit.\n\nNote that the “Initial …” entries (cash, bank, fixed assets) are “balance‐sheet” openings and do not “set” retained earnings – so when no beginning retained earnings is provided we assume it is zero.\n\nIn our “problem to solve” the following steps were taken:\n\n1. (a) Collect the “Sale” transactions that record a “profit” value. Adding together the individual sale profits we obtain approximately\n\n  Sale profits ≈ 1,416,975.85\n\n (b) Then, add the “Interest Receivables” that add revenue (from the eight such rows – six of which are about 127.92 each, one 396.94, and one 85.65) in sum about\n\n  Interest = 396.94 + (6×127.92) + 85.65 ≈ 1,250.10\n\nThus total “revenue” from operations is roughly\n\n  Revenue_total = 1,416,975.85 + 1,250.10 ≈ 1,418,225.95\n\n2. Now, from the “Expense” side we add up all expense‐type transactions that are recorded in the period – these include the “Expense” rows for financial, sales and administrative costs plus the depreciation. (Purchases and fixed‐asset acquisitions are not “expensed” in the income statement—they appear on the balance sheet and the cost of goods sold is already “netted” into the profit reported on the sale records.) When we add (by grouping the many Expense rows) we obtain a total expense of approximately\n\n  Expenses_total ≈ 716,631.63\n\n3. Then the net income for the period (and the change in retained earnings) is\n\n  Net income ≈ Revenue_total – Expenses_total \n        ≈ 1,418,225.95 – 716,631.63 \n        ≈ 701,594.32\n\nSince the beginning (or initial) retained earnings was not provided (and thus assumed to be 0.00) the retained earnings “closing” balance becomes approximately +701,594.32.\n\nThus the final answer we report is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"701594.32\"\n  }\n}\n\n(Values are rounded to two decimals.)",
