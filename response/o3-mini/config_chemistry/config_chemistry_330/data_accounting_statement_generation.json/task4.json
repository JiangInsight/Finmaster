                        "content": "We can “build” the ending balance of outstanding accounts receivable (AR) during the period in two steps. In our case the “Initial” part comes from the very first (opening‐balance) transactions. In this example no AR balance was given in the opening entries so we assume an initial AR balance of 0.00.\n\nThen we review all revenue (sale) transactions during the period that were “sold on account” (that is, the sale is not received as cash immediately but its receive‐method is “Account Receivable” and the payment/receipt status is “Unpaid”). For each such sale the net value (typically the “after_tax_amount” rather than the “amount”) is added to AR.\n\nFor instance, looking at the list we identify (by scanning the “receive_method” column) these Sales (all “Unpaid”):\n\n • Sale20240103004 – after‐tax amount 12,167.95  \n • Sale20240107013 – after‐tax amount 42,144.28  \n • Sale20240108015 – after‐tax amount 363,388.99  \n • Sale20240109018 – after‐tax amount 180,095.29  \n • Sale20240113022 – after‐tax amount 106,356.95  \n • Sale20240114024 – after‐tax amount 637,483.35  \n • Sale20240115026 – after‐tax amount 22,424.35  \n • Sale20240116028 – after‐tax amount 26,135.60  \n • Sale20240116029 – after‐tax amount 39,225.49  \n • Sale20240117032 – after‐tax amount 44,872.36  \n • Sale20240117033 – after‐tax amount 188,916.81  \n • Sale20240118035 – after‐tax amount 64,718.85  \n • Sale20240119036 – after‐tax amount 47,689.89  \n • Sale20240121040 – after‐tax amount 393,600.36  \n • Sale20240124046 – after‐tax amount 651,248.23  \n • Sale20240126048 – after‐tax amount 10,462.56  \n • Sale20240129053 – after‐tax amount 549,455.25  \n\nWhen you add these together you get\n\n  12,167.95  \n + 42,144.28 = 54,312.23  \n + 363,388.99 = 417,701.22  \n + 180,095.29 = 597,796.51  \n + 106,356.95 = 704,153.46  \n + 637,483.35 = 1,341,636.81  \n + 22,424.35 = 1,364,061.16  \n + 26,135.60 = 1,380,196.76  \n + 39,225.49 = 1,419,422.25  \n + 44,872.36 = 1,464,294.61  \n + 188,916.81 = 1,653,211.42  \n + 64,718.85 = 1,717,930.27  \n + 47,689.89 = 1,765,620.16  \n + 393,600.36 = 2,159,220.52  \n + 651,248.23 = 2,810,468.75  \n + 10,462.56 = 2,820,931.31  \n + 549,455.25 = 3,370,386.56  \n\nThat is, the ending (period–end) AR balance will be 3,370,386.56. (Of course, if in your system collections against AR were recorded then those cash receipts would reduce the ending AR balance. In our sample the only “Sale” entries having receive_method “Account Receivable” are the ones above so we assume the full amounts remain outstanding.)\n\nThus the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"3370386.56\"\n  }\n}",
