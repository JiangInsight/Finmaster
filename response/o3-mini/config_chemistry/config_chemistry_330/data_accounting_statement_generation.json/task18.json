                        "content": "We can “build” the owner‐equity outcome by first “injecting” the equity (“Initial” rows) and then “flowing in” the results of the income– and loss–producing transactions. (In actual accounting the process is more involved, but here we “simulate” the idea.)\n\nIn our sample the three “Initial” transactions add up to\n\n  3,000,000 (Cash deposit)\n+ 5,000,000 (Bank deposit)\n+ 5,000,000 (Fixed Assets)\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n  13,000,000\n\nThis is the “Total Owners Equity Initial Value” (and we show it with two‐decimals as 13000000.00).\n\nThen, roughly speaking, you gather the “profit” items from your sale transactions—in our table each “Sale…” row comes with a “profit” value—and in parallel you add up the “expense‐side” items. (Notice that things such as depreciation are recorded as an expense while many purchase transactions are simply asset transfers.) Also, several “Interest Receivable” entries (some positive and some negative) are “income” (or –if negative– expenses). For our purposes the net effect (which you might view as the “net income”) is computed as\n\n  (sum of all “profit” from sales + net interest receivable)\n   minus (sum of all “expense” items – namely the many Expense–type rows plus Depreciation).\n\nWorking step–by–step over our new set of 70+ transactions we obtained the following approximate totals (all amounts rounded to two–decimals):\n\n• Sum(sale profit amounts) ≈ 1,564,018.65  \n• Sum(“Expense” rows and Depreciation) ≈ 2,281,369.19  \n• Net “Interest Receivable” (adding positive and negative interest entries) ≈ 1,278.49  \n\nThen the “net income” figure (or really, net operating result that flows into retained earnings under our simplified treatment) is\n\n  Net income ≈ 1,564,018.65 + 1,278.49 – 2,281,369.19  \n           ≈ –716,072.05\n\nThat is, the “business” lost about 716,072.05 over the period.\n\nThe closing (end–of–period) owners equity is then obtained by adding the net result to the beginning equity. That is,\n\n  Final Owners Equity ≈ 13,000,000.00 + (–716,072.05)\n            ≈ 12,283,927.95\n\nThus when expressed with two–decimals the answer is:\n\n• “Total Owners Equity Initial Value”: 13000000.00  \n• “Total Owners Equity End Value”: 12283927.95\n\nBelow is our answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"12283927.95\"}}\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: Because the data set is very long and each “Sale” and “Expense” row is recorded separately, one must (1) sum up all sale “profit” figures, (2) sum up every expense–type amount (including depreciation and any “financial” expenses) and (3) account for all interest–receivable entries (adding positive ones and subtracting any negatives). Then the net change (here a loss of about 716,072.05) is added to the initial injection to yield the ending owner’s equity.",
