Scanning through the provided transactions, we see that one transaction is of type “Depreciation” with id “Depreciation20240101001” and an amount of 45765.700000000004. (In the sample the number was very similar but now the exact amount is 45765.700000000004.) Typically when reporting in a cash flow statement the value is rounded appropriately. Hence, we can present the figure as 45765.70.\n\nSo the final depreciation item is 45765.70.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45765.70'}}",
