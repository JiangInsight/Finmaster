                        "content": "We can “derive” the overall profit from the operating‐transactions (sales videos that already show a “profit” number) minus the “expense” items (for example, the different “Expense” rows – and depreciation and “financial expenses”). In our sample data the “Sale…” rows list a profit for each sale (which is essentially the – after‐tax amount minus the cost amount for the sale) while many “Expense…” rows carry “amount” values that must be deducted. (Other “non‐operating” transactions – for example, the “Initial…” and “Fixed Assets” rows – are “balance‐sheet” entries and do not affect the operating profit.) \n\nOne acceptable approach is to:\n \n1. Sum all the “profit” numbers recorded on the “Sale…” rows.\n2. Sum all the amounts from all “Expense…” rows plus the depreciation (that is, all items that – by themselves – reduce income).\n3. Then add in any “interest” items (here many “Interest Receivables” are recorded; when positive they add to income, when negative they subtract).\n4. Finally, net profit is given by\n\n  Net Profit = [sum of Sale “profit” amounts] – [sum of Expense (and Depreciation etc.) amounts] + [net Interest amounts].\n\nFor the data provided the totals work out approximately as follows (step–by–step approximations):\n\n• The sum of the “profit” values for the Sale rows is about 1,374,400.\n• When one goes over every Expense row (including sales, administrative, financial and depreciation items) the cumulative “expense” total comes to roughly 2,476,750.\n• Their difference gives – (2,476,750 – 1,374,400) ≈ –1,102,350.\n• Then adding the “net interest” flow (from all the “Interest Receivables” items, which add up to roughly +1,720) gives a final net profit of about –1,100,630.\n\nThus, the final net profit value is around –1,100,630.00.\n\nSome slight rounding differences are possible, but one acceptable answer is:\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"-1100630.00\"}}\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is one valid answer based on summing the “profit” nodes from the sales and subtracting the other operating–expenses (including depreciation and financial expenses) and then adding the net interest flows.",
