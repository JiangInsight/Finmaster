We ignore balance‐sheet entries such as “Initial”, “Fixed Assets Purchase”, “Purchase”, “Transfers” because they do not affect profit.\n2. For “Sale” entries the “profit” field is used (it is the “result” of that sale after subtracting cost of goods).\n3. For each “Expense” row (be it sales, administrative, financial or “Depreciation”), we subtract its “amount” (because these costs reduce profit).\n4. For “Interest Receivables” rows we add their amount (or subtract if the value is negative).\n5. When summing over all such rows – the positive sale “profit” items plus interest and then subtracting all various expense amounts – the final result is –849551.81.\n\nThus the final “Profit Before Tax” is –849551.81.\n\nIn the required JSON format the answer is:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {\"Profit Before Tax\": \"-849551.81\"}}\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is our final answer.",
