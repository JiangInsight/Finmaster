                        "content": "We must “build” the AR balance from those sales and interest receivable items that “increase” AR. (Note that in the indirect cash‐flow method, an increase in AR is subtracted from net income so it appears as a “(decrease)” in cash.) In our case we must add up every transaction that was recorded as a sale on account (that is, where the “receive_method” was “Account Receivable” – note in our table the label may appear as “Account Receviable”) and also include any “Interest Receivables” (those rows whose “asset_name” is “Interest receviable” and are not yet paid). \n\nFor example, looking through the table the following “Sale” transactions are on account (their “receive_method” is “Account Receivable”) and their amounts (the “amount” field) are as follows:\n\n• Sale20240103004:          12808.37 \n• Sale20240107013:          44362.40 \n• Sale20240108015:          382514.73 \n• Sale20240109018:          189573.99 \n• Sale20240113022:          111954.68 \n• Sale20240114024:          671035.10 \n• Sale20240115026:          23604.58 \n• Sale20240116028:          27511.16 \n• Sale20240116029:          41289.99 \n• Sale20240117032:          47234.06 \n• Sale20240117033:          198859.80 \n• Sale20240118035:          68125.11 \n• Sale20240119036:          50199.88 \n• Sale20240121040:          414316.17 \n• Sale20240124046:          685524.45 \n• Sale20240126048:          11013.22 \n• Sale20240129053:          578373.95 \n\nWhen we add these up we obtain (step–by–step):\n  12808.37 + 44362.40 = 57170.77  \n  57170.77 + 382514.73 = 439685.50  \n  439685.50 + 189573.99 = 629259.49  \n  629259.49 + 111954.68 = 741214.17  \n  741214.17 + 671035.10 = 1412249.27  \n  1412249.27 + 23604.58 = 1435853.85  \n  1435853.85 + 27511.16 = 1464365.01  \n  1464365.01 + 41289.99 = 1504655.00  \n  1504655.00 + 47234.06 = 1551889.06  \n  1551889.06 + 198859.80 = 1750748.86  \n  1750748.86 + 68125.11 = 1818873.97  \n  1818873.97 + 50199.88 = 1869073.85  \n  1869073.85 + 414316.17 = 2283390.02  \n  2283390.02 + 685524.45 = 2968914.47  \n  2968914.47 + 11013.22 = 2979927.69  \n  2979927.69 + 578373.95 = 3558301.64  \n\nIn addition, we have a number of “Interest Receivables” (those rows whose “asset_name” is “Interest receviable”). If you add (approximately) the following amounts from each Interest receivable row:\n\n  396.94  \n  127.92 (six times these appear, roughly 6×127.92 ≈ 767.52)  \n  five rows of about 85.65 (≈428.24)  \n  a 39.37  \n  a –31.83  \n  seven rows at about 12.67 (≈88.68)  \n  a –31.64  \n  a –7.28  \n  two rows of about 10.52 (≈21.04)  \n  one row at 8.43  \n  two rows at about 17.33 (≈34.66)  \n  one row of 5.75  \n  one row of 14.65  \n\nWhen you sum these you get roughly 1,734.52.\n\nThus the total ending accounts receivable balance equals the sum of the on‐account sales plus the interest receivables:\n  3,558,301.64 (sales AR) + 1,734.52 (interest) ≈ 3,560,036.16\n\nSince the beginning AR balance is nil (there is no opening balance on account) the net “increase” in accounts receivable during the period is 3,560,036.16. In the indirect method this is shown as a (decrease) in cash so we report it with a negative sign.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-3560036.16\"}}\n``` \n\n(If you wish to round differently the final number may vary slightly; here we round to two decimals.)",
