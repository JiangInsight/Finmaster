                        "content": "After following our “asset‐based” approach – by adding together the beginning balances in cash, bank, and fixed assets and then “rolling forward” the effects of the operating transactions (including increases from receivables and sales profit and decreases from expenses and depreciation) – the overall calculation comes out with an initial asset total of 13,000,000.00 and a final asset balance of 13,216,409.49.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Assets Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Total Assets End Value\": \"13216409.49\"\n  }\n}\n\nBelow is a brief explanation of the reasoning:\n\n1. The “Initial” transactions show three items – cash deposit of 3,000,000.00, bank deposit of 5,000,000.00, and fixed assets of 5,000,000.00 – which sum to 13,000,000.00.\n\n2. Then the subsequent transactions (purchases, sales, expense items, transfers, depreciation, and interest receivables) are recorded so that only the net effects (for example, sales profitability, the adding back of interest receivables, and reductions due to depreciation and expenses) change the overall asset total.\n\n3. After “rolling forward” all non‐internal transfers (which do not change the overall asset sum) and applying the net operating effect, the total asset amount increases by 216,409.49 to reach 13,216,409.49.\n\nThus the computed totals come out as required.",
