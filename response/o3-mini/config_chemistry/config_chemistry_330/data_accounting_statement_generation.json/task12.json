                        "content": "We have to “build up” the accounts payable (AP) balance from the transaction table. In our bookkeeping system the AP balance comes from purchase transactions that were made on credit (“unpaid” and using an “Account Payable” payment method). (Initial balance‐related entries, such as initial cash/asset deposits, normally do not include AP because they are not credit liabilities.) \n\nLet’s check the table row–by–row for “Purchase” transactions:\n\n• • The “Initial20231231001” rows (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) are just starting balances and do not generate any AP liability.\n\n• • The first purchase row is “Purchase20231231001” (amount 540000.0) but its payment status is “Paid” (and the payment method is “Bank Transfer”) so no AP liability is recorded.\n\n• • Next, “Purchase20231231002” (amount 2500000.0) is also “Paid” (via bank transfer).\n\n• • Also “Purchase20231231003” (amount 280000.0) is “Paid” (via bank transfer).\n\n• • Then “Purchase20231231004” (amount 1200000.0) was made “Paid” using Cash (so already settled).\n\n• • The row “Purchase20231231005” is the important one.\n  – Type: “Purchase”\n  – Amount: 2700000.0 \n  – Payment/receipt_status: “Unpaid”\n  – Payment method: “Account Payable”\n\nThis is the purchase that was made on credit and not yet paid. No other purchase transaction with an “Unpaid” status and a payment method of “Account Payable” is recorded in the table.\n\nTherefore, because we assume the beginning (initial) balance of AP is zero and only one purchase was booked on credit, the end balance is exactly the amount of that unpaid purchase – meaning the liability for accounts payable is 2,700,000.0.\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"2700000.00\"\n  }\n}",
