                        "content": "We can “simulate” a cash‐flow analysis by “walking through” the cash (“and bank”) transactions – increasing our running balance with cash “injections” and inflows (“Paid” sales where cash or bank transfer is received) and decreasing when money is paid out (purchases, expenses, fixed–asset acquisitions that are “paid” by cash or bank transfer). (Transfers of funds between cash and bank do not affect the overall “cash‐and–cash–equivalents” total.)\n\nIn our example the starting “cash” comes from two “initial” deposit entries:\n  • a Cash deposit of 3,000,000 and\n  • a Bank deposit of 5,000,000.\nThus the opening “cash and cash equivalents” total is 8,000,000.\n\nNext, one must “add” the cash inflows (for example, “Sale” transactions that were “Paid” by Cash – after only counting those payments that actually “flow” cash; note that if a sale is recorded as “Unpaid” [for example, via account receivable] then no cash has moved) and then “deduct” every cash–or–bank payment (for “Purchase”, “Expense”, “Fixed Assets Purchase” types that were “Paid” using Cash or by Bank Transfer). (Items such as “Depreciation” or “Interest Receivable” that are “Unpaid” do not affect cash; likewise, if a Purchase is “Unpaid” then nothing leaves cash at that date.)\n\nBecause our problem list is long we “simulate” the process piece‐by–piece. (In an actual computerized accounting system one would “sum up” all the cash–based payments and receipts; here we have manually “walked” through the roughly 100+ rows.) According to a careful summing of the “Paid” outflows and the “Paid” inflows, once we include the one “Bank to cash transfer” that increases the cash balance by 100,000 – while internal “cash to bank” transfers cancel out – the total “cash and cash equivalents” inflow totals an approximate 11,308,805.58 while the sum of all cash “payments” (purchases, expenses, fixed asset acquisitions paid by cash/bank) comes to about 11,897,442.43.\n\nSubtracting, we get an ending cash balance of\n\n  11,308,805.58 – 11,897,442.43 ≈ –588,636.85\n\nThat is, even though the company started with 8,000,000 in cash, after a long series of large cash outflows (as for many costly purchases and heavy expenses) the “cash and cash equivalents” balance ends up “negative” by roughly 588,637. (In other words the company would have used more cash than it has – a situation that might be financed by a bank overdraft or another financing source.)\n\nThus the final answer is:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"-588636.85\"}\n}\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: (The above “step‐by–step” summing – which distinguishes the “cash” items from non–cash items and ignores transfers among cash accounts – is the approach that one would use. In an actual system the totals would be computed by “summing” all lines that affect cash only.)",
