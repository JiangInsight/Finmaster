                        "content": "We first have to “build up” the fixed‐asset book value as follows. In the opening (“Initial…”) entries the “Fixed Assets” item is recorded at 5,000,000.00. Then, during the period several new fixed‐asset purchases are recorded. In our data these appear as rows with type “Fixed Assets Purchase” (their id always starts with “FixedAsset…”). Their amounts are:\n\n • 242,704.16  \n • 474,959.83  \n • 465,186.81  \n • 432,676.90  \n • 423,492.61  \n • 226,268.11  \n\nWhen we sum these we get:\n\n 242,704.16 + 474,959.83 = 717,663.99  \n 717,663.99 + 465,186.81 = 1,182,850.80  \n 1,182,850.80 + 432,676.90 = 1,615,527.70  \n 1,615,527.70 + 423,492.61 = 2,039,020.31  \n 2,039,020.31 + 226,268.11 = 2,265,288.42\n\nThus the gross fixed asset base at period end is the initial amount plus these new acquisitions:\n\n 5,000,000.00 + 2,265,288.42 = 7,265,288.42\n\nFinally, we must “subtract” any depreciation. In our transactions there is one depreciation entry:\n • Depreciation20240101001 with an amount of 45,765.70\n\nThus the net fixed assets at period end are\n\n 7,265,288.42 – 45,765.70 = 7,219,522.72\n\nSo the answer is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'fixed assets net Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'fixed assets net End Value': '7219522.72'} }\n```",
