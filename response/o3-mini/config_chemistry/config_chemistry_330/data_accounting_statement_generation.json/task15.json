                        "content": "We need to “read” the entire list of transactions and “pick out” the ones that give rise to a liability. In our case the only items that (once the opening‐balance is set up) add to “liabilities” are those purchases done on credit. (The “Initial” entries are all asset accounts so they do not bring in any liability.) \n\nLooking carefully at our new problem example, we see that among the “Purchase” rows in the table only one row is recorded as “Unpaid” (that is, the purchase has not been paid yet and is recorded via “Account Payable”). In our new problem the only such row is \n\n  • Purchase20231231005 – a Purchase of amount 2700000.0 (with Payment/receipt status “Unpaid” and Payment method “Account Payable”). \n\nNo other “Purchase” entry appears as “Unpaid” (all other acquisitions are “Paid”). Also, none of the Interest or Expense items are “liabilities” (they feed into the income statement or are directly recorded against cash).\n\nThus, when we set up the opening balances the liability item (for example “Accounts Payable”) is zero and then after all the transactions the only ongoing liability is from the outstanding unpaid purchase.\n\nTherefore we conclude:\n\n  • Total Liabilities Initial Value = 0.00  \n  • Total Liabilities End Value = 2700000.00\n\nSo our answer in the required JSON format is as follows: \n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"2700000.00\"\n  }\n}",
