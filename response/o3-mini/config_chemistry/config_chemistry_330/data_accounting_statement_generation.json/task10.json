                        "content": "We must “build” the fixed‑asset total by starting with the initial “Fixed Assets” entry and then updating that number by adding all the purchases of long‑lived items and then reducing that sum by the (non‑cash) depreciation expense that relates to these assets.\n\nIn the data the only “initial” non‐current asset is the row\n\n  • Initial20231231001 with type “Fixed Assets” and an amount of 5,000,000.00.\n\nThen we look for transactions whose type is “Fixed Assets Purchase” (which have an “asset_name” and “asset_type” provided). In the table you can “see” the following rows and amounts:\n\n1. A row with id “FixedAsset20231231001” (the first occurrence)   amount = 242,704.16  \n2. A row with id “FixedAsset20231231001” (the second occurrence)  amount = 474,959.83  \n3. A row with id “FixedAsset20231231001” (the third occurrence)  amount = 465,186.81  \n4. A row with id “FixedAsset20231231001” (the fourth occurrence)  amount = 432,676.90  \n5. A row with id “FixedAsset20231231001” (the fifth occurrence)  amount = 226,268.11  \n6. A row with id “FixedAsset20231231001” (the sixth occurrence)  amount = 423,492.61  \n\nWe add these six fixed–asset purchase amounts together. In our step‐by‐step arithmetic:\n\n  242,704.16 + 474,959.83 = 717,663.99  \n  717,663.99 + 465,186.81 = 1,182,850.80  \n  1,182,850.80 + 432,676.90 = 1,615,527.70  \n  1,615,527.70 + 226,268.11 = 1,841,795.81  \n  1,841,795.81 + 423,492.61 = 2,265,288.42  \n\nThus, new additions total 2,265,288.42.\n\nNext, we look at depreciation. There is one depreciation row:\n  • Depreciation20240101001: amount = 45,765.70\n\nThe “end‐of‑period” (book) value for non‑current assets is computed as\n\n  Initial value + fixed–asset additions – depreciation\n\nThat is:\n\n  5,000,000.00 + 2,265,288.42 = 7,265,288.42  \n  7,265,288.42 – 45,765.70 = 7,219,522.72\n\nThus our final non–current (property, plant and equipment) assets are valued at 7,219,522.72.\n\nWe now present the answer in the requested json format.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"7219522.72\"\n  }\n}",
