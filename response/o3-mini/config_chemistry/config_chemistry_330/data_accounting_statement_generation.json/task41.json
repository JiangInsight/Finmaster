                        "content": "We need to determine the net change in (i.e. the “Increase (Decrease) in”) accounts payable as it would appear on a cash‐flow statement. In our bookkeeping system the “Purchase” transactions that are recorded as “Unpaid” and use the payment method “Account Payable” indicate that the firm has incurred an expense but has not yet paid for it. (Other purchase entries that are “Paid” do not show up in accounts payable because payment was already made.)\n\nStep‑by‑step, we do the following:\n\n1. Scan all rows where the transaction type is “Purchase”. (Only these normally affect accounts payable.)\n2. Among those records, identify those that did not get paid (“Unpaid”) and – often – use “Account Payable” as the payment method.\n3. In our “Problem to Solve” table the only “Purchase” transaction recorded as “Unpaid” with a payment method of “Account Payable” is:\n  • Purchase20231231005 – Amount = 2700000.0\n   – Payment/receipt_status = “Unpaid”\n   – Payment_method = “Account Payable”\n4. None of the other purchase rows are “Unpaid” (they were all paid either by Bank Transfer or Cash) so they do not leave a liability on the balance sheet.\n5. Therefore the net increase in Accounts Payable (which is the balance of purchases not yet paid as of period‑end) is 2,700,000.00.\n\nThus, the answer we report is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"2700000.00\"\n  }\n}",
