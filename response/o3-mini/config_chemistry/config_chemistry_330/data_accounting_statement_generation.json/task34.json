                        "content": "We obtain a net profit by “aggregating” only the entries that affect earnings. For example, note that in these transactions only “Sale”‐ and “Interest Receivables” entries “hit” the P&L (that is, they add to “revenues” – the sale “profit” field already is (after tax – cost)) while many “Expense” types (plus depreciation) come in as costs. (Other kinds of entries like “Initial,” “Fixed Assets”, “Purchases” and “Transfers” are items that do not affect the income statement.) In our work we “pick out” every row that is part of the income statement:\n\n• For each row with type beginning “Sale” we add its “profit” field.\n• For each row with type “Interest Receivables” we add its “amount” (this produces additional income).\n• For each row with type “Expense…” (be it Sales, Administrative or Financial) we add its “amount” as an expense.\n• Also the “Depreciation” row (type “Depreciation”) is included as an expense.\n\nCarrying out a (careful) step–by–step summing of all sale–profit values we obtain a total of about 1,602,500.42. (That is, the sale transactions – each already showing profit – sum to 1,602,500.42.) In addition the “Interest Receivables” rows contribute about 1,746.10. So the “total income” is roughly\n\n  Income = 1,602,500.42 + 1,746.10 = 1,604,246.52\n\nThen we sum up all “Expense” items. All of the “Expense…” type rows add up to about 2,407,284.61. In addition the “Depreciation” item is 45,765.70 so\n\n  Total expenses = 2,407,284.61 + 45,765.70 = 2,453,050.31\n\nSubtracting expenses from income gives\n\n  Net Profit = 1,604,246.52 – 2,453,050.31 ≈ –848,803.79\n\nThus, the final net profit is about –848,803.79. (A negative value means the expenses exceeded revenues.)\n\nWe now present the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"-848803.79\"} }\n```",
