                        "content": "We must look at which transactions affect investing cash flows. In our case “investing activities” are those that involve acquisitions (or disposals) of long‐term assets. In our data the only items that affect investing cash flows are those with a “type” of “Fixed Assets Purchase” (the “Initial … Fixed Assets” row is an opening balance and not a cash flow – it is not “new” cash spent during the period).\n\nIn the provided table there are exactly six rows with type “Fixed Assets Purchase” (their record identifiers start with “FixedAsset20231231001”). Their (recorded) cash amounts are listed as follows:\n\n• Row A: 242,704.16  \n• Row B: 305,354.43  \n• Row C: 465,186.81  \n• Row D: 432,676.90  \n• Row E: 226,268.11  \n• Row F: 423,492.61\n\nBecause the company is spending cash on fixed assets, these cash flows are “outflows” (a negative number). The net cash used in investing activities is therefore the sum of these amounts multiplied by –1.\n\nStep‐by‐step sum:\n 1. Sum the amounts:\n  242,704.16 + 305,354.43 = 548,058.59  \n  548,058.59 + 465,186.81 = 1,013,245.40  \n  1,013,245.40 + 432,676.90 = 1,445,922.30  \n  1,445,922.30 + 226,268.11 = 1,672,190.41  \n  1,672,190.41 + 423,492.61 = 2,095,683.02\n\nSince each of these represents an expenditure on investing (no investing inflows are visible), the net cash flow from investing activities is –2,095,683.02.\n\nThus, in the requested json format the answer is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-2095683.02\"\n  }\n}\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the final answer.",
