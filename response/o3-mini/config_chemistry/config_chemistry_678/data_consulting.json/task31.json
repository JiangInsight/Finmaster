                        "content": "We first need to calculate each metric using the following formulas:\n\n1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue ÷ Average Accounts Receivable  \n  • Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) ÷ 2.  \n   • Here, beginning AR = 0 (since on 2023‑12‑31 the Accounts Receivable is 0) and ending AR = 1,604,015.21.  \n   • Average AR = (0 + 1,604,015.21) ÷ 2 = 802,007.605  \n  • Total Revenue (from income statement) = 5,755,241.17  \n  • Thus, Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 5,755,241.17 ÷ 802,007.605 ≈ 7.18\n\n2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio (and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio) = Operating Cash Flow ÷ Total Current Liabilities  \n  • Operating Cash Flow (from cash flow) = –7,724,112.71  \n  • Total Current Liabilities (from balance sheet at period end) = 737,762.05  \n  • Ratio = –7,724,112.71 ÷ 737,762.05 ≈ –10.47\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue ÷ Average Total Assets  \n  • Average Total Assets = (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) ÷ 2.  \n   • Beginning Total Assets = 13,000,000.00  \n   • Ending Total Assets = 12,385,382.42  \n   • Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 12,385,382.42) ÷ 2 ≈ 12,692,691.21  \n  • Ratio = 5,755,241.17 ÷ 12,692,691.21 ≈ 0.45\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities ÷ Total Owner’s Equity  \n  • Here total liabilities are the total current liabilities (as no non-current liabilities are provided): 737,762.05  \n  • Total Owner’s Equity (from balance sheet end) = 11,647,620.37  \n  • Ratio = 737,762.05 ÷ 11,647,620.37 ≈ 0.0633, which rounds to 0.06\n\nThus, the final answers rounded to two decimal places are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"7.18\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-10.47\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-10.47\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.45\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.06\"\n  }\n}",
