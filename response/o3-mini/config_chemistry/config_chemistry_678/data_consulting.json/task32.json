                        "content": "We can work through the solution step‐by‐step.\n\nStep 1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n• In our example the FCF is obtained by adding the net cash flows from operating activities and investing activities.\n• From the cash‐flow statement:\n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –7,724,112.71  \n  Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = –480,116.37  \n• FCF = –7,724,112.71 + (–480,116.37) = –8,204,229.08\n\nStep 2. Return on Assets (ROA)\n• ROA is normally computed as Net Profit divided by average Total Assets.\n• From the income statement, Net Profit = –1,352,379.63\n• From the balance sheet, beginning Total Assets = 13,000,000.00 and ending Total Assets = 12,385,382.42\n  Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 12,385,382.42) / 2 = 12,692,691.21\n• ROA = (–1,352,379.63 / 12,692,691.21) × 100 = –10.65%\n\nStep 3. Return on Equity (ROE)\n• ROE = Net Profit divided by average Owner’s Equity.\n• Net Profit = –1,352,379.63  \n• From the balance sheet, beginning Owner’s Equity = Paid-in Capital = 13,000,000.00  \n  Ending Owner’s Equity = 11,647,620.37  \n  Average Owner’s Equity = (13,000,000.00 + 11,647,620.37) / 2 = 12,323,810.19\n• ROE = (–1,352,379.63 / 12,323,810.19) × 100 ≈ –10.97%\n\nStep 4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n• This ratio is calculated by dividing the net cash flow from operating activities by the net income (using absolute values when both are negative).\n• = (–7,724,112.71 / –1,352,379.63) ≈ 5.71\n\nStep 5. Net Profit Margin\n• This is defined as Net Profit divided by Total Revenue.\n• From the income statement, Total Revenue = 5,755,241.17 and Net Profit = –1,352,379.63\n• Net Profit Margin = (–1,352,379.63 / 5,755,241.17) × 100 ≈ –23.50%\n\nStep 6. Gross Profit Margin\n• This is computed as Gross Profit divided by Total Revenue.\n• Gross Profit = 1,075,241.17 and Total Revenue = 5,755,241.17\n• Gross Profit Margin = (1,075,241.17 / 5,755,241.17) × 100 ≈ 18.69%\n\nThus, the solution in the requested JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-8204229.08\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"-10.65%\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"-10.97%\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"5.71\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"-23.50%\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"18.69%\"\n  }\n}",
