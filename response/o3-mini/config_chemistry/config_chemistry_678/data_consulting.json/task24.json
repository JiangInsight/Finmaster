                        "content": "We first extract the relevant data from the balance sheet and cash flow/income statement.\n\nStep 1. Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio.\n• Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets.\n• In the balance sheet, Total Liabilities is the “Total Current Liabilities” (since there are no non‐current liabilities separately given). That value is 737762.05.\n• The Total Assets (end amount) is given as 12385382.42.\n• Thus, Debt to Asset Ratio = 737762.05 / 12385382.42 ≈ 0.05957, which rounds to 0.06.\n\nStep 2. Calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio.\n• This ratio is defined as:\n  Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Net Profit)\n• From the cash flow statement:\n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –7724112.71.\n• From the income statement:\n  Net Profit = –1352379.63.\n• Dividing these two (note that a negative divided by a negative is positive):\n  Ratio = (–7724112.71) / (–1352379.63) ≈ 5.712, which rounds to 5.71.\n\nThus, our final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.06\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"5.71\"\n  }\n}",
