                        "content": "We first extract the required numbers from the financial statements. In our case:\n\n• Operating Cash Flow from the cash flow statement (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities): –7,724,112.71  \n• Current Liabilities (from the balance sheet, “Total Current Liabilities”): 737,762.05  \n• Inventory – Beginning is 0 and Ending Inventory is 5,550,000.00 (so average inventory = (0 + 5,550,000.00)/2 = 2,775,000.00)  \n• Cost of Goods Sold from the income statement: 4,680,000.00  \n• Total Liabilities: (we only have “Total Current Liabilities”): 737,762.05  \n• Total Owner’s Equity from the balance sheet: 11,647,620.37  \n• Current Assets from the balance sheet (“Total Current Assets”): 6,951,011.84  \n• To calculate Quick Assets: subtract Inventory from Current Assets = 6,951,011.84 – 5,550,000.00 = 1,401,011.84\n\nNow we compute:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n  = –7,724,112.71 / 737,762.05 ≈ –10.47\n\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / (Total Debt)  \n  Since our only debt is current liabilities, this ratio is also  \n  = –7,724,112.71 / 737,762.05 ≈ –10.47\n\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  \n  = 4,680,000.00 / 2,775,000.00 ≈ 1.69\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity  \n  = 737,762.05 / 11,647,620.37 ≈ 0.06\n\n5. Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities  \n  = 1,401,011.84 / 737,762.05 ≈ 1.90\n\n6. Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \n  = 6,951,011.84 / 737,762.05 ≈ 9.42\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-10.47\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-10.47\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"1.69\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.06\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.90\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"9.42\"\n  }\n}",
