                        "content": "Step 1. Current Ratio  \n• Use the balance sheet “Total Current Assets” and “Total Current Liabilities”.  \n Total Current Assets = 6,951,011.84  \n Total Current Liabilities = 737,762.05  \n Current Ratio = 6,951,011.84 ÷ 737,762.05 ≈ 9.42  \n\nStep 2. Gross Profit Margin  \n• Use the income statement “Gross Profit” and “Total Revenue”.  \n Gross Profit = 1,075,241.17  \n Total Revenue = 5,755,241.17  \n Gross Profit Margin = (1,075,241.17 ÷ 5,755,241.17) × 100 ≈ 18.68%  \n\nStep 3. Debt to Asset Ratio  \n• Here we assume total liabilities equals “Total Current Liabilities” (737,762.05) since there are no other liability items provided.  \n Total Assets = 12,385,382.42  \n Debt to Asset Ratio = 737,762.05 ÷ 12,385,382.42 ≈ 0.06  \n\nStep 4. Net Profit Margin  \n• Use “Net Profit” and “Total Revenue” from the income statement.  \n Net Profit = -1,352,379.63  \n Total Revenue = 5,755,241.17  \n Net Profit Margin = (-1,352,379.63 ÷ 5,755,241.17) × 100 ≈ -23.49%  \n\nStep 5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio  \n• Use the ending “Cash and Cash Equivalents” from the cash flow statement and “Total Current Liabilities”.  \n Ending Cash Balance = -204,229.08  \n Total Current Liabilities = 737,762.05  \n Cash to Current Debt Ratio = -204,229.08 ÷ 737,762.05 ≈ -0.28  \n\nStep 6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)  \n• FCF is calculated as Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities minus capital expenditures (i.e. Purchase of Fixed Assets).  \n Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -7,724,112.71  \n Capital Expenditure = 480,116.37  \n FCF = -7,724,112.71 - 480,116.37 = -8,204,229.08  \n\nStep 7. Return on Assets (ROA)  \n• ROA is calculated as Net Profit divided by Total Assets.  \n Net Profit = -1,352,379.63  \n Total Assets = 12,385,382.42  \n ROA = (-1,352,379.63 ÷ 12,385,382.42) × 100 ≈ -10.92%  \n\nNow, presenting the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"9.42\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"18.68%\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.06\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"-23.49%\",\n    \"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"-0.28\",\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-8204229.08\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"-10.92%\"\n  }\n}",
