                        "content": "Step 1: Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio.\n• Total Liabilities are taken from the balance sheet as the sum of current liabilities. In this problem these are:\n  Accounts Payable = 450,000.00 \n  Taxes Payable = 287,762.05 \n  Total Liabilities = 450,000.00 + 287,762.05 = 737,762.05\n• Total Assets (End Amount) = 12,385,382.42\n• Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets = 737,762.05 / 12,385,382.42 ≈ 0.05955, which rounds to 0.06\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Gross Profit Margin.\n• Gross Profit is given from the income statement as 1,075,241.17.\n• Total Revenue = 5,755,241.17.\n• Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100% = (1,075,241.17 / 5,755,241.17) × 100% ≈ 18.69%\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n• Operating Cash Flow is the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities, which is –7,724,112.71.\n• Total Current Liabilities from the balance sheet = 737,762.05.\n• Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Current Liabilities = –7,724,112.71 / 737,762.05 ≈ –10.47\n\nThus, the solution in JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.06\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"18.69%\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-10.47\"\n  }\n}",
