ROE (Return on Equity):  \nFor ROE we use the net profit from the income statement and the average owner’s equity.  \n• Net Profit = –1,352,379.63  \n• Owner’s Equity at the beginning (from the balance sheet) = 13,000,000.00  \n• Owner’s Equity at the end = 11,647,620.37  \n• The average owner’s equity = (13,000,000.00 + 11,647,620.37) / 2 = 12,323,810.185  \nThen,  \n  ROE = (Net Profit) / (Average Equity)  \n    = –1,352,379.63 / 12,323,810.185  \n    ≈ –0.1097 or –10.97%\n\n2. Debt to Asset Ratio:  \nThis ratio is calculated by dividing total liabilities by total assets (we use end-of-period figures).  \n• Total Liabilities (from balance sheet; here only current liabilities are provided) = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 450,000.00 + 287,762.05 = 737,762.05  \n• Total Assets at end = 12,385,382.42  \nThus,  \n  Debt-to-Asset Ratio = 737,762.05 / 12,385,382.42  \n    ≈ 0.0596, which we round to 0.06\n\n3. Gross Profit Margin:  \nThis margin is calculated using the gross profit and total revenue from the income statement.  \n• Gross Profit = 1,075,241.17  \n• Total Revenue = 5,755,241.17  \nThus,  \n  Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100  \n    = (1,075,241.17 / 5,755,241.17) × 100  \n    ≈ 18.68%\n\nNow we present the results in the required JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"-10.97%\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.06\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"18.68%\"\n  }\n}",
