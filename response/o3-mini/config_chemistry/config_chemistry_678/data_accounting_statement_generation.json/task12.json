                        "content": "We need to figure out which transactions affect the accounts payable (“AP”) balance. In our business‐record system any “Purchase” entry that is not paid is recorded as a liability under accounts payable. In these data rows the “Purchase” transactions that are paid are “cleared” (with a bank transfer or cash) so they do not remain on AP. Only those “Purchase” transactions that remain “Unpaid” (and normally are recorded with the “Account Payable” payment method) remain on the balance sheet as outstanding liabilities.\n\nStep 1. – Look at the “Initial” transactions. They show deposits (cash, bank, fixed assets) but do not record any outstanding AP. So we begin with an initial AP balance of 0.00.\n\nStep 2. – Look through all transactions with type “Purchase”:\n • “Purchase20231231001” on Dec 31 – paid by bank transfer (amount 800,000.0).\n • “Purchase20231231002” – paid (amount 3,000,000.0).\n • “Purchase20231231003” – note that this row has a status “Unpaid” and a payment_method “Account Payable” and an amount of 450,000.0. This one increases the AP balance.\n • All subsequent “Purchase” transactions (such as _31004, _31005, _31006, _31007, _31008, _31009, _31010, _31011, _31012, _31013) are recorded as “Paid”.\n\nThus only the Purchase20231231003 is still “Unpaid” and that amount is exactly 450,000.\n\nStep 3. – Since no other adjustments (payments of AP liabilities or additional credit purchases) occur in the period, the final AP balance is simply 450,000.00.\n\nSo, our answer is:\n\n{\n  \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"450000.00\"\n}\n\nBelow is the final json in the requested format. \n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal answer:\n────────────────────────────\n  \n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"450000.00\"\n  }\n}",
