                        "content": "We can “build” an income‐statement (“profit‐and‐loss” statement) from the detailed transactions. One way of “reverse‐engineering” the final profit before tax is as follows. (All numbers below are “net” figures obtained from our detailed summing of individual items.)\n\nStep 1. For each SALE transaction the “profit” column already reflects the gross profit on that sale (that is, sale’s after‐tax revenue minus its cost amount). When we add up the profit figures (from every “Sale” row) we obtain a total “gross profit” from sales of about 1,075,241.17.\n\nStep 2. The “Expense” transactions (including all Administrative, Sales and Financial Expenses) plus the Depreciation entry (a type of noncash expense) must be “deducted” when building the income statement. When we add up every “Expense” (in our table there are over 60 individual expense transactions) we obtain a total expense (operating expense) sum of about 2,065,388.43; then adding the Depreciation of 45,745.79 brings the total “expenses” to about 2,111,134.22.\n\nStep 3. In addition the “Interest Receivables” transactions (even though some come in with a negative value) add up to net “other income” of about +1,242.62.\n\nStep 4. Now the profit before tax (PBT) is computed conceptually as:\n\n  PBT = (Gross profit from sales) + (Interest income) – (Operating expenses [+ depreciation])\n\nIn our case this is\n\n  PBT = 1,075,241.17 + 1,242.62 – 2,111,134.22 ≈ –1,034,650.43\n\nThus, the overall final profit before tax comes out to be around –1,034,650.43.\n\nBelow is our answer in the requested json format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Profit Before Tax\": \"-1034650.43\"}}",
