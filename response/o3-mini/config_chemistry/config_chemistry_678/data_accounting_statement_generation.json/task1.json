                        "content": "We end up with a “cash‐on‐hand” balance that starts with the 3,000,000 cash deposit and – after subtracting every “cash‐in” and “cash‐out” transaction that use the “Cash” payment (plus “Cash to bank” moves which remove cash and “Bank to cash” moves that add cash) – a net (final) cash on hand of about –213,863.02. \n\nBelow is our reasoning summary:\n\n1. We “seed” the cash account with the initial cash deposit of 3,000,000 (the bank deposit and fixed–asset entries do not count as cash on hand).\n2. Then we process every subsequent row that uses “Cash” as its payment (or, for sales, receipt) mode. For example, cash–paid expense amounts (administrative, sales, financial, etc.) are subtracted while “Sale” transactions that were paid in cash add the sale amount.\n3. In addition, “Cash to bank transfer” rows subtract cash while “Bank to cash transfer” rows add cash.\n4. Adding up (and subtracting) over the entire list – noting that many transactions are paid by bank transfer or use accounts receivable (thus having no immediate cash effect) – the running balance falls from the initial 3,000,000 down to approximately –213,863.02.\n\nThus the final answer (showing both the starting cash on hand and the ending cash on hand) is provided in the expected JSON format.\n\nBelow is the final answer:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Cash on Hand Initial Value': '3000000.00', 'Cash on Hand End Value': '-213863.02'} } \n\n(NOTE: Because nearly every cash transaction has been “booked” as an expense or a transfer out, the end‐of–period cash balance comes out negative.) \n\nKeep in mind that in a real accounting system, a negative cash balance may indicate an overdraft situation (or that the “cash on hand” account entry is offset by a bank account asset or liability elsewhere).",
