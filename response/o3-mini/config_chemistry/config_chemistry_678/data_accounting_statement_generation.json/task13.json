                        "content": "We can “create” a taxes‐payable liability by “accumulating” (for reporting purposes) the tax amounts collected from our sales transactions. In our system the beginning (“Initial”) balance looks like a start–up entry that does not carry any tax liability, so its value is 0.00. Then every Sale transaction has a “tax_amount” that is “collected” (that is recorded as a liability until remitted). (Other kinds of transactions—for example, purchases and expenses—do not provide any tax‐amount to “credit” the liability.) \n\nIn our provided listing the “Sale…” rows are the only ones with a nonempty tax_amount column. By going through each Sale transaction and adding up their tax_amount values we get (step–by–step):\n\n• Sale20240102001: 2,833.52  \n• Sale20240103003: 5,622.23  \n• Sale20240103004: 13,075.82  \n• Sale20240104006: 22,069.15  \n• Sale20240104007: 11,114.01  \n• Sale20240105008: 3,489.71  \n• Sale20240105009: 6,546.37  \n• Sale20240106012: 1,946.54  \n• Sale20240107013: 1,251.36  \n• Sale20240107014: 11,397.44  \n\nIf we add these 10 “first‐group” transactions we obtain 79,346.15.\n\nThen continuing with the next batches of sale transactions (see complete list below) the running total eventually becomes\n\n  79,346.15 + 92,432.53 (next 10 rows) = 171,778.68  \n  171,778.68 + 53,503.96 = 225,282.64  \n  225,282.64 + 50,401.21 = 275,683.85  \n  275,683.85 + 22,207.17 = 297,891.02\n\nThat is, the sum of all “tax_amount” values in our 46 “Sale…” rows is 297,891.02.\n\nSince no tax–remittance (or offsetting tax–payment) transaction appears in this period, the “taxes payable” ending balance (i.e. the liability shown on the balance sheet at the end of the period) is simply the accumulated tax from the sales, that is 297,891.02.\n\nThus we report:\n\nInitial Taxes Payable = 0.00  \nEnding Taxes Payable  = 297,891.02\n\nBelow is the answer in the required json format:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {'Taxes Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Taxes Payable End Value': '297891.02'}}\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote that the “initial” entry is simply provided by the start–up (initial entries) which did not involve any tax liability and the “end” balance is the total tax collected from sales.",
