                        "content": "We must “simulate” a bank‐deposit account by “starting” from the Initial “Bank deposit” value and then “adjusting” it for every transaction that draws from (or adds to) the bank account. In our case only two kinds of entries affect bank deposits:\n\n1. Purchases (or other payments) that are paid by “Bank Transfer” (which “withdraw” from bank deposits).\n2. Cash–to–bank transfers (and the reverse “Bank to cash” transfers). When money is moved from cash into the bank, that increases the bank deposit balance; conversely, a “Bank to cash transfer” removes money from the bank.\n\nLet’s go step by step:\n\n• The initial “Bank deposit” is entered on 2023‑12‑31 with an amount of 5,000,000.00.\n\n• Next, look at the “Purchase…” entries (or any payment made by a bank transfer) that reduce the bank deposit:\n\n – Purchase20231231001 (Bank Transfer)         800,000.00  \n – Purchase20231231002 (Bank Transfer)        3,000,000.00  \n – Purchase20231231004 (Bank Transfer)        130,000.00  \n – Purchase20231231008 (Bank Transfer)        380,000.00  \n – Purchase20231231010 (Bank Transfer)        1,500,000.00  \n – Purchase20231231011 (Bank Transfer)        900,000.00  \n\nWhen added together these “bank–paid” amounts are:  \n800,000 + 3,000,000 = 3,800,000  \n3,800,000 + 130,000 = 3,930,000  \n3,930,000 + 380,000 = 4,310,000  \n4,310,000 + 1,500,000 = 5,810,000  \n5,810,000 + 900,000 = 6,710,000  \n\nSo a total “withdrawal” of 6,710,000.00.\n\n• Now consider the “Transfer” entries that move cash into (or out of) the bank:\n\nAlmost every “Cash to bank transfer” increases your bank deposit by the stated amount. In our table the “Cash to bank transfer” rows appear many times – if you count them you get 27 such transfers, each of 100,000.00 (i.e. 27 × 100,000 = 2,700,000.00).\n\nThere is one “Bank to cash transfer” (row 194) for 100,000.00 that reduces the bank deposit.\n\nThus, the net effect of transfers is: 2,700,000.00 – 100,000.00 = 2,600,000.00\n\n• Finally, the ending bank deposit is computed as\n\n  Initial bank deposit + net transfer inflow – total bank‐paid amounts =  \n  5,000,000.00 + 2,600,000.00 – 6,710,000.00 = 5,000,000.00 – 6,710,000.00 + 2,600,000.00\n\nStep–by–step:  \n5,000,000.00 – 6,710,000.00 = –1,710,000.00; then –1,710,000.00 + 2,600,000.00 = 890,000.00\n\nThus the end-of–period bank deposit stands at 890,000.00.\n\nNo other transaction (for example sales received in cash or on account or expenses paid by cash) alters the bank deposit.\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"890000.00\"} }",
