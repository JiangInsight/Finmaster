                        "content": "We obtain the “net” operating cash flow by summing up – as cash‐inflows – all “Sale” items that were paid, and then subtracting from that the cash “outflows” (i.e. purchases and all expense transactions that actually involved a cash payment). (Note that items such as “Initial …”, “Fixed Assets …”, “Depreciation …”, “Transfers …” and “Interest …” that are marked “Unpaid” are not considered to cause a current cash change.) \n\nIn our data we “walk‐through” (see below a brief outline of how one could add each paid operating item):\n\n1. For example, a “Sale20240102001” of 56,670.46, “Sale20240103003” of 112,444.65, “Sale20240103004” of 261,516.46, “Sale20240104006” (441,383.00), “Sale20240104007” (222,280.28), etc. were recorded as cash inflows. When you add every paid “Sale” transaction you get a total inflow of about 4,151,225.96.\n\n2. Likewise, when you add every “Purchase” and “Expense” (of types Administrative, Sales, Financial – not counting items that are non‑cash adjustments such as depreciation) that were paid you obtain a total cash outflow of about 11,638,473.86.\n\nSubtracting the total outflows from the inflows gives\n\n  Net operating cash flow = 4,151,225.96 – 11,638,473.86 ≈ –7,497,247.90\n\nThus the final answer is:\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-7497247.90\"\n  }\n}\n\n(Notice that due to rounding the answer is given to two decimals.)",
