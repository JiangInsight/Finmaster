(Any other items in the “Initial…” record such as Cash deposit or Bank deposit are not part of fixed assets.)\n\nNext we scan the transactions for any that affect the fixed asset item. In addition to the initial book‐value we find a record with type “Fixed Assets Purchase” (id FixedAsset20231231001) with an amount of 480,116.37. (Other “Purchase” transactions are for raw materials or similar goods not added as fixed assets.) \n\nThen we check if there has been any “Depreciation” transaction. We find one depreciation record:\n  Depreciation20240101001 with an amount of 45,745.79.\nDepreciation is deducted from the fixed assets net value.\n\nThus the calculation is as follows:\n Initial fixed assets = 5,000,000.00\n Add: Fixed assets purchase = 480,116.37\n Subtotal = 5,480,116.37\n Less: Depreciation = 45,745.79\n Ending fixed assets net value = 5,480,116.37 – 45,745.79 = 5,434,370.58\n\nWe then format our answer accordingly.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"fixed assets net Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"fixed assets net End Value\": \"5434370.58\"}}",
