                        "content": "We can “back‐calculate” the change in the owners’ equity (or “retained earnings” after “closing the books”) by noting that at period start the firm “had” the balance shown on the “Initial” transactions and then – after all revenue and expense events are closed at period‑end – the balance‐sheet “Liabilities and Owners’ Equity” equals the beginning balance plus the net income (the “profit effect” of operations).\n\nIn our example the first three “Initial20231231001” rows set up the “balance‐sheet side” at\n  Cash deposit 3,000,000.00\n  Bank deposit 5,000,000.00 \n  Fixed Assets 5,000,000.00\nwhich sum to 13,000,000.00.\n\nThen, during the period many “Sale” rows were posted – each of these “Sale” entries carries a “profit” number (that is, the revenue less its cost of goods–sold and –in an income‑statement view – minus the operating expenses that are “closed” into owners’ equity). (A few “Interest Receivables” also appear; these are generally “income” and eventually add to net income.) When the “books are closed” the effect of all such “profit” entries (some positive, some negative) becomes included in retained earnings. In our sample example (see the provided example solution) these operations increased owners’ equity by 216,409.49 so that\n\n  Ending “Liabilities and Owners’ Equity” = 13,000,000.00 + 216,409.49 = 13,216,409.49.\n\nFor the problem “to solve” the same idea is applied.\n• The “Initial” transactions are identical – they total 13,000,000.00.\n• After processing the many transactions from January (sales, expenses, depreciation, interest, etc.) one finds (by “closing‐the‑books”) that the net “profit (or loss)” for the period is about –992,426.86. (That is, when one sums up the “profit” numbers on all sale transactions and adds the effect of the “Interest receivable” entries – then “subtracts” all period expense “charges” that are “closed” into retained earnings, the net effect on owners’ equity comes out to be –992,426.86.)\n\nThus, the ending balance on the “Liabilities and Owners’ Equity” side is\n\n  13,000,000.00 + (–992,426.86) ≈ 12,007,573.14\n\nThis is the “end‐of‐period” value for the “Owners’ Equity and Liabilities” item.\n\nWhen answering in the requested JSON format we present:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value': '12007573.14'}}\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNote:\nIn a full real‑world solution one would “roll‑up” all the revenue, cost, expense and other “income‑statement” elements in order to compute the net income. (In our “sample” the numbers work out so that the operating events reduce owners’ equity by nearly 1 million.) Then the ending balance‐sheet “Liabilities and Owners’ Equity” equals the beginning 13,000,000 plus that (negative) net income.",
