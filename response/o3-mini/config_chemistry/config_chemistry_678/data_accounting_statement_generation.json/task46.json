However, the “beginning balance” on the cash flow statement is taken as the cash and cash equivalents on December 31, 2023. In this data the only items that are considered cash and cash equivalents at inception are the “Cash deposit” (3,000,000.0) and the “Bank deposit” (5,000,000.0). (The “Fixed Assets” entry does not count as cash or cash equivalents.) Their sum is 3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 = 8,000,000.0.\n\nThus, the final beginning balance is 8,000,000.00.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'}}",
