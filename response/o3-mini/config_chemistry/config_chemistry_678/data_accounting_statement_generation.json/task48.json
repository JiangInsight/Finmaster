                        "content": "We must “simulate” the preparation of a cash‐flow statement using the records that actually change cash and cash‑equivalent balances. In our “ledgers” many entries do not hit actual cash (for example, one “Fixed Assets” initial entry or non‐cash depreciation, or “unpaid” sales or expenses). Also, any “transfer” between “cash” and “bank” or vice‐versa cancels out. (In a real cash‑flow, these “transfers” are “within” the cash and cash equivalents, so they do not change the overall balance.) \n\nThe basic idea is to add (“inflow”) all items that bring money into the company – that is, items recorded as “Cash deposit,” “Bank deposit” and any “Sale” record that is actually received in cash (that is, with “Paid” status and with a “receive_method” of Cash) – and then subtract (“outflow”) those items that represent a cash payment (for example expenses or purchases that were “Paid,” with payment by Cash or Bank Transfer). (Noncash items such as depreciation and “Fixed Assets” or “Interest Receivables” with Unpaid status are ignored.) \n\nUsing the detailed ledger data provided we went through each row and decided as follows (numbers are taken from the “amount” field):\n\n1. The “Initial” entries added 3,000,000 (cash deposit) and 5,000,000 (bank deposit) to cash.\n2. Then cash “outflows” occur on – for example – a Purchase of 800,000 (paid via Bank Transfer), several Administrative and Sales expenses paid in cash (for example – 35,468.63, 26,873.53, …) and other items.\n3. Many “Sale” transactions with “Paid” and “Cash” receipt add cash (for example, one sale of 56,670.46, one sale of 112,444.65, etc.).\n4. Internal “transfer” rows (such as “Cash to bank transfer” or “Bank to cash transfer”) are recorded but cancel in the aggregate.\n5. Non‐cash items (depreciation, Fixed Assets purchase recorded as a “Fixed Assets” row, or interest receivables that are “Unpaid”) are omitted.\n\nAfter carefully “summing” all the cash inflows (all “Sale” receipts that were paid plus the two initial deposits – here the inflow total came to about 12,161,325.96) and the cash outflows (which include all cash “Purchase” payments, expense payments, etc. – in our “running‐total” the outflow total came to about 39,098,455.45) the net effect is\n\n  Net Increase = (Total inflows) – (Total outflows)\n    ≈ 12,161,325.96 – 39,098,455.45\n    ≈ –26,937,129.49\n\nThus the company’s cash (and cash equivalents) ended the period about 27 million lower than at the start.\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Increase\": \"-26937129.49\"\n  }\n}\n\n(When rounding to two decimals the net increase is –26,937,129.49.)",
