                        "content": "We must “build” the balance‐sheet “liabilities” by looking only for transactions that (a) represent a “purchase” recorded on a “credit” (for which the payment/receipt status is Unpaid) and (b) are posted using a “payment method” that clearly shows a liability (for example “Account Payable”). (Any “Initial” entry is not a liability–typically the “Initial” entries set up assets rather than liabilities.) \n\nIn the new problem’s list the only “Purchase” record whose “payment/receipt_status” is “Unpaid” is the one with id “Purchase20231231003”. Its amount is 450000.0. (All the other purchase‐records have “Paid” status.) \n\nThus, at the beginning the liabilities balance “Initial” is zero and the only liability added in the period is 450000.0 so that the “Final” liabilities balance is 450000.0.\n\nThe answer is therefore:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"450000.00\"\n  }\n}",
