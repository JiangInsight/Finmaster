                        "content": "We only need to “pick out” the cash flows that relate to investing activities – that is, cash flows from acquiring or disposing of long‑term investments and fixed assets. In our list many transactions are operating (sales, purchases of inventory, expenses, transfers, etc.) or financing (initial cash or bank deposits) but only one transaction clearly reflects an investing cash flow. Notice that the “Initial…” rows (cash deposit, bank deposit and even the “Fixed Assets” row that sets up the opening balance) are not “flows” during the period—they represent opening balances. (In the example solution the only investing activity in the period was the fixed asset purchase.)\n \nLooking through the list we find that the only transaction that clearly is an investment cash flow is the one with\n  \n  id = FixedAsset20231231001  \n  type = Fixed Assets Purchase  \n  amount = 480116.37\n \nBecause buying a fixed asset takes cash, this is a cash outflow. (There is no offsetting disposal of fixed assets.) Therefore, the net cash flow from investing activities is –480116.37.\n\nWe now present the answer as required:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-480116.37\"\n  }\n}",
