                        "content": "We must “close‐the books” by “adding up” only those operations that affect the income statement. In our case the only entries that “flow through” the profit & loss (P&L) – that is, not the initial “balance‐sheet” items (Initial, Fixed assets, Purchases, Transfers) – are the “Sale” rows (each of which already carries a computed “profit” value), the “Interest Receivables” (which add to “other income”) and all the “Expense” (including Administrative, Sales, Financial) and “Depreciation” rows (all treated as costs that reduce profit).\n\nOne acceptable method is to “net‐up” by summing (a) every sale’s profit plus the amounts from Interest Receivables (which may be added or subtracted if negative) and (b) subtracting every “Expense” and “Depreciation” entry. (Other “balance‐sheet”–only items such as Purchases, Transfers, Fixed Assets, Initial deposits do not “hit” P&L.)\n\nStep‐by‐step we “read” the hundreds of rows – for example, one sale (Sale20240102001) shows a “profit” of 6670.46, another (Sale20240103003) a profit of 12444.65, etc. In our full “work‐through” we add up all the “profit” numbers (from every Sale row) arriving at a total of about 1,074,241.17. Then we add all the “Interest Receivables” entries (for example, 373.80, 106.80, 95.23, etc – noting that a couple are negative) and obtain a net “interest income” of about 1,225.71. In other words the “revenues” from “trading” read approximately\n\n  Revenue = 1,074,241.17 + 1,225.71 ≃ 1,075,466.88.\n\nThen we add together every “Expense” and “Depreciation” row (all the Sales, Administrative, Financial expenses as well as Depreciation) and – after summing nearly 80 expenses – obtain a total cost of about 2,058,403.44.\n\nThen the net profit is simply\n\n  Net Profit = (Sales profit + Interest income) – Total expenses \n         ≃ 1,075,466.88 – 2,058,403.44 \n         ≃ –982,936.56\n\nThus the final net profit on the income statement is about –982,936.56.\n\nMany “implementations” might differ a little (rounding up to two decimals) but one acceptable answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": { \"Net Profit\": \"-982936.56\" }\n}",
