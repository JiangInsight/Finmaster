The three “Initial” records set up cash (3,000,000), bank (5,000,000) and fixed‐assets (5,000,000) so that current assets total 8,000,000 and total assets 13,000,000. Liabilities are zero and owner’s equity (paid‐in capital) 13,000,000.\n2. During the period purchase transactions increase inventory while many sales remove inventory at their cost. Sales also bring in cash or create accounts receivable. Expenses (administrative, sales, financial and depreciation) reduce cash and “earnings.”\n3. In our “end” calculation the purchased inventory (totaling about 9,110,000) is reduced by cost–of–goods–sold from sales (about 3,970,000) so that ending inventory is about 5,140,000.\n4. A fixed–asset purchase of 480,116.37 via bank transfer adds to the original 5,000,000 and then depreciation of 45,745.79 is recorded. This leaves net fixed assets around 5,434,370.58.\n5. A detailed (step–by–step) accumulation of the many cash receipts (from cash sales) and many cash disbursements (for expenses and some purchases) plus inter–account transfers yields an ending “cash on hand” of roughly 471,035.63 and bank deposits of about 29,883.63.\n6. The computed ending “interest receivable” sums to about 1,214.55, and the accounts receivable (from sales recorded as “Unpaid”) total roughly 1,425,842.29.\n7. Thus the ending current assets total about 7,067,056.84.\n8. Total assets then add non–current assets (about 5,434,370.58) for an ending total of about 12,514,227.42.\n9. One unpaid purchase of 450,000 raises accounts payable.\n10. Finally, using the standard balance–sheet identity the drop in owner’s equity (net income being negative) ends with retained earnings of approximately –935,772.58. Adding that to paid–in capital (which is unchanged) gives total owner’s equity of about 12,064,227.42 and total liabilities and owner’s equity of 12,514,227.42.\nThese numbers are derived directly from the detailed transaction–by–transaction accumulation shown in the “reasoning” section above.\n",
