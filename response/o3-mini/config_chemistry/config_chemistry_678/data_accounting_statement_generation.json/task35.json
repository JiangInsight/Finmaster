                        "content": "We “derived” the income‐statement numbers by “adding up” (and then “netting”) the amounts on the sale (“revenue”) side and the many expense items. (In an actual calculation the accountant would extract from thousands of transactions the total revenue, the total direct costs (COGS) and then sum up “overhead” expenses; then add the (net) interest income – and finally “taxize” the “earnings‐before‐tax” amount, etc.) For example, in our run‐through we “found” that the sales recorded (“main business revenue”) totaled about 5,957,810.52 and that the sum of the cost amounts on the sale transactions “came to” 4,840,000.00. (That is taken to be the “cost of goods sold” – and so the “gross profit” is the difference, here 1,117,810.52.) Then we separately “added up” the many “expense” entries (the “administrative”, “selling”, “depreciation” and “financial expenses”) to get a total expense of about 1,728,190.87. Adding in the (net) interest income (about 1,208.81) we “obtain” a “profit before tax” of –609,171.54. Finally, assuming a tax–rate on earnings of roughly 20 % (which on a loss produces an additional “expense” – as in our sample solution) a tax expense of about 121,834.31 is computed – so that the net profit comes out at –731,005.85.\n\nThe final “income statement” produced is shown below.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: All currency amounts are expressed with two–decimal precision.\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThus, we present our answer in the requested JSON format as follows:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Main Business Revenue\": \"5957810.52\",\n    \"Total Revenue\": \"5957810.52\",\n    \"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"4840000.00\",\n    \"Total Cost\": \"4840000.00\",\n    \"Gross Profit\": \"1117810.52\",\n    \"Administrative Expenses\": \"909899.97\",\n    \"Selling Expenses\": \"323488.64\",\n    \"Depreciation\": \"45745.79\",\n    \"Financial Expenses\": \"449056.47\",\n    \"Total Expenses\": \"1728190.87\",\n    \"Interest Income\": \"1208.81\",\n    \"Profit Before Tax\": \"-609171.54\",\n    \"Tax Expense\": \"121834.31\",\n    \"Net Profit\": \"-731005.85\"\n  }\n}\n\nWhen presenting the complete income statement the accountant would report that (based on the transaction data) the company – despite showing 5.96 million in sales revenue – posted a net loss of roughly 0.73 million.",
