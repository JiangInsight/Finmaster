                        "content": "We can “build” an income‐statement (the “profit‐and‐loss” part of the cash flow statement) by summing up all the revenue components (in our sales transactions, plus “other income” for interest receivables) and then subtracting all the “expenses” (including operating expenses such as administrative, sales, financial expenses and also depreciation). (Purchases of inventory and fixed‐assets are “investing” or “capitalized” rather than “expense” so they do not “hit” the net profit calculation.)\n\nBelow is one way to “simulate” the calculation from the data provided. (Note that in a real accounting system the “profit” on each sale is already computed as “after tax amount” minus “cost amount”. In our case several “Sale” rows carry a “profit” figure. In addition, several “Interest” rows represent an income (if their amount is positive) or a reduction in income (if negative). Finally, the “Expense” rows (and the one Depreciation row) must be subtracted.)\n\nStep 1. Sum the “Sale” rows’ profit amounts. (For example, if you add up \n  6670.46 + 12444.65 + 61516.46 + 41383.00 + 22280.28 + … + 14300.25 \nthe total comes out approximately to 1,116,820.52.)\n\nStep 2. Sum the “Interest Receivables” amounts. In our table there are many “Interest” rows; when you add the positive interest amounts (for example 373.80, 106.80, 106.80, 95.23, 95.23, 95.23, 95.23, 61.41, 61.41, plus further several smaller positive amounts such as several 16.91’s etc. plus 0.88, 2.66, 11.56 and 0.21) and then subtract the negative ones (–18.69, –54.29, –27.59) the net interest income is about 1,208.80. (All numbers taken “as‐is” from the table.) \n\nStep 3. Their “operating” income is then roughly\n  1,116,820.52   (total sale profit)  +  1,208.80  (net interest income)\n        ≈ 1,117,029.32\n\nStep 4. Sum all  “Expense”–type rows. (That is, all rows whose type is “Expense…”; these include Administrative Expenses, Sales Expenses, Financial Expenses – and also note the Depreciation row of 45,745.79 which, though “non‐cash” in nature, is an expense from an income‐statement viewpoint.) When you add all those expense amounts (by grouping them by date and then summing the many entries) you get a total of roughly 2,133,345.24.\n\nStep 5. Finally, compute the “net profit” as:\n  net profit  = (Operating income) – (Expenses)\n      ≈ 1,117,029.32 – 2,133,345.24\n      ≈ –1,016,315.92\n\nThus the cash‑flow “Net Profit” coming out from the transaction data is approximately –1,016,315.92.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"-1016315.92\"} }\n```",
