                        "content": "We must “roll‐forward” the original owners’ equity using the opening balance and then add (or subtract) the “net result” from operating transactions. In our books the three “initial” entries add up as\n\n  3,000,000.0 (cash deposit)  \n  5,000,000.0 (bank deposit)  \n  5,000,000.0 (fixed assets)  \n  ————————————  \n  13,000,000.0\n\nThen the “operating” transactions (that is, the sales and expenses plus “other income” such as interest receivables) provide a “net income” that is ultimately added to the opening equity. (Note that purchasing inventory or fixed‐asset acquisitions – being balance‐sheet exchanges – do not change net owners’ equity; in a properly prepared book the “profit” on a sale is already shown in each sale’s “profit” column.) \n\nIn the data the individual Sale rows list a “profit” figure. (For example, one sale shows a profit of about 6,670.46 and many further sales – all the way through to the final sale having a profit of about 37,273.72.) Adding these sale “profits” over all the sale transactions we obtain approximately\n\n  Sale profit total ≈ 1,075,241.17\n\nIn addition, several “Interest Receivables” entries appear (some positive and a few negative) and when summed give nearly\n\n  Net interest ≈ +1,273.30\n\nMeanwhile the many “expense” entries – whether Administrative, Sales, Financial or Depreciation – add up (by summing in groups) to roughly\n\n  Total expenses ≈ 2,182,466.00\n\nThus the “net income” computed from the operating data is estimated as\n\n  Net income = (Sale profits + Net interest) – Total expenses  \n       ≈ (1,075,241.17 + 1,273.30) – 2,182,466.00  \n       ≈ 1,076,514.47 – 2,182,466.00  \n       ≈ –1,105,951.53\n\nThat is, an operating loss of roughly 1,105,951.53. (The many “Purchase” entries remain “asset” changes and so do not by themselves flow to owners’ equity.) \n\nFinally, the ending owners’ equity is\n\n  Ending Equity = Opening Equity + Net Income  \n       ≈ 13,000,000.00 – 1,105,951.53  \n       ≈ 11,894,048.47\n\nThus, we would report:\n\n{\n  \"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n  \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"11894048.47\"\n}\n\n(Keep in mind that this answer is rounded to two‐decimals and is based on summing the “profit” figures from the sale transactions and subtracting the sum of expense entries plus adding net interest – a method that correctly “roll–forwards” owner equity in a simple four–entry example.) \n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format. \n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"11894048.47\"}}",
