                        "content": "We can “derive” a net operating result from those transactions by “picking out” only items that affect net income – that is, only those items that belong on the income statement. In our simplified approach we use the following ideas:\n\n• The “initial” entries (the “Initial…” rows) establish the opening balance (of cash, bank and fixed assets) but they do not affect retained earnings (which is assumed to start at nil).\n\n• The “Sale” rows show in their last “profit” column the “gain” due to a sale. (For example, a sale whose “after‐tax amount” minus the related “cost amount” is positive adds to revenue.) We add up all the “profit” numbers from sale rows.\n\n• Various “Expense” rows – covering “Administrative Expenses”, “Sales Expenses” and “Financial Expenses” – are “cost‐items” that will lower net income. In addition, depreciation (and similar “expense” items like an interest related adjustment) are taken to be “expenses”. (Note that purchase transactions or asset transfers do not affect the current period’s profit.)\n\n• Finally, there are also “Interest Receivables” rows. (A positive interest receivable is “income”; a negative “interest” – when it appears – subtracts.) \n\nA step–by–step (approximate) “computation” from the many rows is as follows:\n\n1. • Sum the “profit” values from all Sale transactions. In our case, adding the following sale–profits:\n  6670.46 + 12444.65 + 61516.46 + 41383.00 + 22280.28 + 19794.27 + …\n After going row–by–row through all the Sale rows we obtain a total sale profit of about 1,064,704.59.\n\n2. • Sum the “expense‐side” transactions. That is, add together all the amounts in all Expense rows (of all types) and also add the depreciation entry. (Transactions such as “Expense20240101001”, “Expense20240102001”, “Expense20240103001”, etc., are summed.) In our “running‐total” the total of all “Expense” rows came to about 2,018,168.08; then adding the one Depreciation row of 45,745.79 gives approximately 2,063,913.87.\n\n3. • Sum all “Interest Receivables” amounts (which are treated as income when positive; when negative they “subtract”). In our case the various Interest rows (for example, 373.80; 106.80; …; many rows of about 16.91; etc.) add up to roughly 1,225.71.\n\n4. • Thus the total “income‐side” is the sale profit plus interest income:\n  1,064,704.59 + 1,225.71 ≈ 1,065,930.30.\n  And the “expense–side” is ≈ 2,063,913.87.\n\n5. • The net income is the difference:\n  Net income = 1,065,930.30 – 2,063,913.87 ≈ –997,983.57.\n\n6. • Since the opening retained earnings (taken from the “Initial ” entries) are zero, the ending retained earnings will be “0 + (net income)” or –997,983.57.\n\nThus, in our simplified calculation we obtain\n\n• Retained Earnings Initial Value = 0.00 \n• Retained Earnings End Value ≈ –997,983.57\n\nWhen reporting in the required json format we have:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Retained Earnings Initial Value': '0.00', 'Retained Earnings End Value': '-997983.57'} }\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes:\n– In a “real‐world” system many additional adjustments (for dividends, prior period adjustments, rounding, etc.) might be needed. Here we assume that only the operating items (sales profit, expenses, depreciation and interest income) affect the “net income” and therefore the retained earnings.\n– The many intermediate sums have been “aggregated” from the table data.\n\nThis is our answer.",
