                        "content": "We have to compute the net change in accounts payable. In our records the only purchases posted on December 31 that were not “Paid” are those that “remain unpaid” (and normally are recorded using the “Account Payable” payment method).\n\nStep 1. Review all Purchase transactions from 2023‑12‑31 in the data:\n\n• Purchase20231231001 – Amount = 800,000.0, but “Paid” (via Bank Transfer) → no effect on AP  \n• Purchase20231231002 – Amount = 3,000,000.0, “Paid” (via Bank Transfer) → no effect  \n• Purchase20231231003 – Amount = 450,000.0, “Unpaid” and Payment Method “Account Payable” → this becomes an obligation  \n• Purchase20231231004 – Amount = 130,000.0, “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231005 – Amount = 70,000.0, “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231006 – Amount = 220,000.0, “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231007 – Amount = 80,000.0, “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231008 – Amount = 380,000.0, “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231009 – Amount = 220,000.0, “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231010 – Amount = 1,500,000.0, “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231011 – Amount = 900,000.0, “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231012 – Amount = 380,000.0, “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231013 – Amount = 2,100,000.0, “Paid”  \n\nStep 2. The only purchase transaction that is “Unpaid” (and so increases Accounts Payable) is Purchase20231231003 with an amount of 450,000.0.\n\nStep 3. Since there is no reduction (that is, no payment on existing AP) indicated in the provided transactions, the net change (increase – decrease) in Accounts Payable is simply 450,000.0.\n\nThus, the Increase in Accounts Payable is 450,000.00.\n\nWe now report the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"450000.00\"}}\n```",
