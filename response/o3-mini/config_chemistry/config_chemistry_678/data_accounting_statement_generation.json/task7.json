In this ledger the only fixed asset “addition” is the “FixedAsset20231231001” row (type “Fixed Assets Purchase”) with an amount of 480,116.37. (The other purchase entries and expense items deal with operating costs and purchases of inventory or expenses). \n\nDepreciation is recorded as a separate entry so it is deducted from the gross fixed assets value. In our table there is one depreciation entry – “Depreciation20240101001” with an amount of 45,745.79.\n\nThus the ending net fixed assets are calculated as follows:\n\n  Ending Fixed Assets = Opening Fixed Assets + Fixed Asset Purchase – Depreciation  \n     = 5,000,000.00 + 480,116.37 – 45,745.79  \n     = 5,480,116.37 – 45,745.79  \n     = 5,434,370.58\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"5434370.58\"\n  }\n}",
