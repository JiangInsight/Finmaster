                        "content": "We reviewed every entry and found that almost all rows “match” the printed invoice‐text (which is considered very reliable). Only a handful of rows include a clear numerical sign error or an approver discrepancy. In particular, we found four problems:\n\n1. In one “Financial Expenses” record recorded with id Expense20240104001 the invoice narrative says “…the approver is Director” yet the recorded information does not list an approver (“None”).  \n2. In the Interest Receivables record with id Interest20240110010 the “recorded_amount” is –18.69 even though from the transaction details (which always use a positive total) the correct amount should be 18.69.  \n3. In the Interest Receivables record with id Interest20240111011 the “recorded_amount” is –54.29 whereas from the narrative it should be 54.29.  \n4. In the Interest Receivables record with id Interest20240112012 the “recorded_amount” is –27.59 while based on the issue (and the other similar interest entries) it should be 27.59.\n\nBelow is our answer in the requested JSON format.
