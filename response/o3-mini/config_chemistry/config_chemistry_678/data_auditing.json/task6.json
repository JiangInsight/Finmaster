                        "content": "We found four records where a field appears to have a value that does not match what the “in‐invoice” narrative indicates. In the sale transaction “Sale20240104007” the narrative says the per–unit price should be $55,570.07 (4 units × that price gives the printed total) but the recorded unit price is $62,452.40. Also, in three “Interest Receivables” rows the invoice text shows a positive interest amount even though the recorded value is negative. (It is not reasonable to post a negative interest receivable.) In “Interest20240110010,” “Interest20240111011” and “Interest20240112012” our best estimate is that the correct interest amount should be the absolute value (i.e. 18.69, 54.29 and 27.59 respectively).\n\nBelow is our JSON‐formatted solution.
