From the Balance Sheet, we need the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares. This is represented by the \"Paid-in Capital\" line item. Its end value is 13000000.00.\n\n2. From the Income Statement, we need the profit (or loss) before deducting tax expense. This is represented by \"Profit Before Tax\". Its reported value is -1064617.58.\n\n3. From the Cash Flow Statement, we look for the addition in the amount owed for goods or services purchased on credit. This is indicated by \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\". Its amount is 450000.00.\n\nThus, grouping the answers in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement, the final solution is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '-1064617.58', 'value3': '450000.00'}}",
