In the sample example, the corresponding cost to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services was taken from the \"Selling Expenses\" line item. For this problem, the \"Selling Expenses\" value is 477715.85.\n2. In the cash flow statement, we see a line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\". In the sample example, the cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment came from this line item. For this problem, the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" value is 666078.18.\n\nThus, the two extracted values are:\nvalue1: \"477715.85\" (Selling Expenses from the Income Statement)\nvalue2: \"666078.18\" (Purchase of Fixed Assets from the Cash Flow Statement)\n\nThe final answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"477715.85\", \"value2\": \"666078.18\"}}",
