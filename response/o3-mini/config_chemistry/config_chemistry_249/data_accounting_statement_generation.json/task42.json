                        "content": "We must “recover” the tax‐related flows from the transaction set. (In our bookkeeping system, certain Sale transactions record “tax_amount” along with “after_tax_amount” – while the other kinds of transactions are not “tax” related.) In most jurisdictions the “tax payable” in a cash‐flow “working” calculation is obtained by (roughly) “output tax” (that is, the total tax collected on sales) minus any tax payments (or “input tax” credits). In the provided new data no purchase or expense transaction carries a tax figure but several “Sale” rows do record a tax amount. (In our system, these “Sale” rows reflect taxes that have “accrued” but have not necessarily yet been paid.) \n\nThus, we simply “recover” the tax amounts from each sale row and add them together. For example, one sale “Sale20240103003” has tax_amount = 8337.84; another “Sale20240104004” has 17464.83; and so on. (Below is the list of all sale transactions with tax_amount values that appear in the table:)\n\n1. 8337.84  \n2. 17464.83  \n3. 2212.51  \n4. 11648.38  \n5. 27961.38  \n6. 11358.16  \n7. 14560.65  \n8. 6735.63  \n9. 28087.63  \n10. 599.74  \n11. 11285.31  \n12. 1197.17  \n13. 1175.53  \n14. 11401.47  \n15. 5761.37  \n16. 572.62  \n17. 15207.24  \n18. 645.41  \n19. 12598.91  \n20. 1166.35  \n21. 6296.39  \n22. 11752.68  \n23. 2393.63  \n24. 1181.28  \n25. 2081.40  \n26. 6295.30  \n27. 27828.12  \n28. 5008.56  \n29. 14316.86  \n30. 2432.87  \n31. 13434.57  \n32. 1157.91  \n33. 645.19  \n34. 13888.96  \n35. 12262.37  \n36. 1278.82  \n37. 13224.89  \n38. 2591.18  \n39. 6113.34  \n40. 1255.77  \n41. 6416.86  \n\nWhen we add these 41 tax amounts together the sum is calculated step‐by‐step as follows:\n\n• First five rows sum to 67,624.94  \n• Adding the next five brings the total to 128,966.75  \n• Including the next five makes 159,787.60  \n• Then the following five yield 213,683.51  \n• Next five bring us to 269,565.22  \n• Then the next five yield 310,954.22  \n• Finally, adding the last six gives a grand total of 341,835.08  \n\nBecause no “tax‐payment” (input tax) is recorded in any purchase/expense row of this file, the net increase in the tax payable account – that is, the tax collected from sales that have not yet been paid out – is 341,835.08.\n\nThus the final “Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable” in the cash‐flow statement will be:\n\n{\n  \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"341835.08\"\n}\n\nHere is the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"341835.08\"} }\n```",
