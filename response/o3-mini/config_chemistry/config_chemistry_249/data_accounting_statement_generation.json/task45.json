                        "content": "We have to pick out only the “investing” transactions – namely those whose type indicates a (purchase of) fixed asset – and then sum their cash amounts (using the recorded_amount field). In this case, browsing through the list we see two transactions that clearly belong to investing activities:\n\n1. A transaction with id FixedAsset20231231001 and type “Fixed Assets Purchase” with an amount of 362437.67  \n2. Another transaction with id FixedAsset20231231001 and type “Fixed Assets Purchase” with an amount of 303640.51\n\nSince cash spent on buying fixed assets is an outflow, we add these two amounts and use a negative sign. Their total is:\n\n  362437.67 + 303640.51 = 666078.18\n\nTherefore, the net cash flow from investing activities is –666078.18.\n\nBelow is the final answer in the required json format.\n\n  \n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-666078.18'} }\n```",
