                        "content": "We need to “build” the Accounts Payable figure by looking only at the transactions (of type “Purchase”) that have not been paid – that is, those with an “Unpaid” status and whose payment method indicates that the supplier will be paid later (in our books this is recorded as “Account Payable”). (The opening “Initial” entries such as the cash deposit, bank deposit or fixed asset purchases do not affect the payable liability.) \n\nLet’s scan the Purchase-type transactions:\n\n• Purchase20231231001 (amount 340,000.0) was “Paid” via Bank Transfer, so it does not create a payable.\n• Purchase20231231002 (amount 1,900,000.0) is “Paid” in Cash.\n• Purchase20231231003 (amount 600,000.0) is “Paid” via Bank Transfer.\n• Purchase20231231004 (amount 260,000.0) is also “Paid.”\n• Purchase20231231005 is marked as “Unpaid” and its payment method is “Account Payable” – its amount is 460,000.0.\n• Purchase20231231006 (amount 450,000.0) was “Paid.”\n• Purchase20231231007 (amount 850,000.0) was “Paid.”\n• Purchase20231231008 is “Unpaid” with payment method “Account Payable” – its amount is 800,000.0.\n• All other Purchase rows (Purchase20231231009, Purchase20231231010, Purchase20231231011, Purchase20231231012) show “Paid” status.\n\nThus the only amounts that add to the Accounts Payable balance are:\n 460,000.0 + 800,000.0 = 1,260,000.0\n\nSince there is no indication that any outstanding payable was carried over from a previous period (the opening “Initial” transactions do not include any liability) the AP “Initial Value” is 0.00 and the AP “End Value” (after processing all these transactions) is 1,260,000.00.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"1260000.00\"} }\n```",
