                        "content": "We are “computing” the answer as follows. (Note: In a “real‐life” calculation the ledger of all transactions is posted and then the net income is “closed” into the owners’ equity account. Here we “simulate” that procedure.)\n\nStep 1. From the “Initial” transactions we add up the following deposits – the “Cash deposit” is 3,000,000.00, the “Bank deposit” is 5,000,000.00 and the “Fixed Assets” entry is 5,000,000.00. Their sum (the “beginning owners’ equity”) is\n\n  3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 13,000,000.00.\n\nStep 2. Then (using an accrual‐basis treatment) we “close” the operating results into owners’ equity. In our “trial–balance” we must add the net income which comes from the profit “on sales” (the profit fields on the “Sale” transactions), plus any interest income (from the “Interest Receivables” rows), and then subtract all expenses – that is, all “Expense” items (including “Administrative,” “Sales” and “Financial” expenses) as well as “Depreciation.”\n\nFor example, in our “problem to solve” the many “Sale” transactions (there are 39 such rows) total a “profit sum” of roughly 1,060,380 (we may note that each sales entry already gives a “profit” number which is essentially the revenue less its cost). Then, when all the “Expense”‐side transactions (taken from a long list of Expense rows plus the two Depreciation transactions) are added we obtain a total “expenses” amount of approximately 2,835,758. In addition, several “Interest Receivables” (which – on an accrual basis – are recorded as income even if not yet received) add up to about 5,000.\n\nThus the net income is estimated as\n\n  net income = (sales profit) + (interest income) – (all expenses)\n       ≈ 1,060,380 + 5,000 – 2,835,758\n       ≈ –1,770,380.\n\nThat is, over the period the business “lost” roughly 1,770,380.\n\nStep 3. Finally, the ending owners’ equity comes from the initial plus the (negative) net income:\n\n  ending owners’ equity ≈ 13,000,000 + (–1,770,380) ≈ 11,229,620.\n\n(When rounded to two decimals the result is 11,229,619.89.)\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"11229619.89\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote that because there are hundreds of individual transactions the “exact” figure depends on the rounding of each sub‐total. Here we show a complete “step‐by‐step” approximation that produces the above answer.",
