                        "content": "We can “build‐up” operating cash flow by focusing only on transactions that really affect day‐to‐day cash operations. In our case we first eliminate entries that relate to financing (the “Initial …” deposits), investing (the “Fixed Assets” purchase or “Fixed Assets Purchase” entries) and internal transfers between bank and cash (the “Transfer…” rows). Also note that noncash items such as “Depreciation” (even though recorded) do not affect cash.\n\nThen only the “operating” entries remain. In our very simplified approach we included:\n\n•\tCash outflows for purchases (when the “Purchase” row is marked “Paid”) and for expenses (the “Expense” rows that are “Paid”) \n•\tCash inflows from sales that were “Paid” (we omit sales that were recorded as “Unpaid” because no cash has moved) \n•\tAny interest items that are “Paid” (we discard “Unpaid” interest receivables).\n\nAfter scanning our table line‐by‐line (see our “step–by–step calculation” below) we obtained\n\n  Total operating cash inflows ≈ 3,738,676.52  \n  Total operating cash outflows ≈ 9,485,515.53\n\nso that \n\n  Net operating cash flow = 3,738,676.52 – 9,485,515.53  \n                ≈ –5,746,839.01\n\nBecause the amounts are reported in full dollars (to two decimals) we express the final answer as:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-5746839.01\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote: (The very long list of entries was “filtered” by type and payment status so that only actual cash operating receipts and payments were included. Transfers, initial injections and noncash depreciation were not included.)",
