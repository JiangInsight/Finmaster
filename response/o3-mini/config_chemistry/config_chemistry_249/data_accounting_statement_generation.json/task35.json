First the “Sale”‐type transactions (identified by IDs beginning with “Sale”) provided a total sales “amount” sum equal to about 6,836,701.10. This is taken as both the Main Business Revenue and the Total Revenue.\n\n2. Each sale also carries a “cost_amount” field. Summing those 41 sales (for example, the first sale had 150,000.00, the next 250,000.00, and so on) yielded a total cost (COGS) of 5,700,000.00. Their difference gives the Gross Profit:\n  Gross Profit = Total Revenue – Cost of Goods Sold = 6,836,701.10 – 5,700,000.00 = 1,136,701.10.\n\n3. Next the various “Expense” rows are grouped by expense category.\n  • “Administrative Expenses” (from many transactions on 2024‐01‐01, 2024‐01‐03, etc.) sum to about 1,570,036.33.\n  • “Sales Expenses” (again, from appropriate “Expense” rows) sum to about 328,615.06.\n  • “Depreciation” items (there is one on 2024‐01‐01 and one on 2024‐02‐01) add to 100,239.89.\n  • “Financial Expenses” (all “Expense” rows with that type) total roughly 567,220.86.\n  The Total Expenses is the sum of these expense group totals: 1,570,036.33 + 328,615.06 + 100,239.89 + 567,220.86 = 2,566,112.14.\n\n4. Several “Interest Receivables” rows appear; adding them gives an Interest Income of about 5,155.29.\n\n5. Then the Profit Before Tax is computed by taking the Gross Profit, subtracting the Total Expenses, and adding any Interest Income:\n  Profit Before Tax = 1,136,701.10 – 2,566,112.14 + 5,155.29 = –1,424,255.75.\n\n6. Assuming a roughly 20% tax rate on the absolute value of the loss (as in the sample problem) the Tax Expense comes to about 284,851.15.\n\n7. Finally, the Net Profit is the Profit Before Tax minus the Tax Expense:\n  Net Profit = –1,424,255.75 – 284,851.15 = –1,709,106.90.\n\nThe answer is therefore presented in the JSON above. Note that the figures have been calculated approximately by grouping the similar transactions and summing their “amount” fields as described.",
