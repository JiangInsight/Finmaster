                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” this problem by noticing that the three “Initial” entries are identical to the previous case – namely a Cash deposit of 3 000 000, a Bank deposit of 5 000 000 and a Fixed Assets entry for 5 000 000. Their sum gives an “initial total” of\n\n  3 000 000 + 5 000 000 + 5 000 000 = 13 000 000.\n\nDuring the period many transactions occurred. (The “Sale” rows include a “profit” field that is already “net–of cost” for that sale while the many “Expense” rows then directly reduce the period’s operating result.) In our “rough‐by‐hand” simulation we may summarize the idea as follows:\n\n1. Sum all “profit” amounts from all sales – in our case that total came to approximately 1 135 700.\n2. Add in any additional “interest revenue” (from all the Interest–Receivables rows) – here roughly 5 155.\n3. Then sum all “expense” rows (including administrative, sales, financial, and depreciation) – in our data the total expense was estimated at roughly 2 690 000.\n4. Thus the period’s net operating result (net income) is approximately\n\n  (1 135 700 + 5 155) – 2 690 000 ≈ –1 549 100.\n\n5. Since (in the absence of dividend payments) the owner’s equity “rolls through” as\n  Initial owner’s equity + net income, the “ending” Owner’s Equity becomes\n\n  13 000 000 + (–1 549 100) = 11 450 900 (approximately).\n\n6. But note that some purchases were not “paid” but recorded as “Account Payable”. In our new data there are two purchase transactions recorded as unpaid – one for 460 000 and one for 800 000. These represent financing (liabilities) that did not “hit” equity when the purchase was recorded. (Paid purchases simply exchange one asset for another.) Thus the ending total “Liabilities and Owners’ Equity” is the ending owner’s equity plus the total unpaid purchase amounts\n\n  1 460 000 = 460 000 + 800 000.\n\nSo, the ending total is approximately\n\n  11 450 900 + 1 260 000 = 12 710 900.\n\nRounding to two decimals we report an “initial” value of 13 000 000.00 and an “end” value of about 12 710 900.00.\n\nFor the purpose of this answer we will present the answer as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value': '12710900.00'}}\n\n(Notice that slight rounding differences are possible when one works transaction‐by‐transaction; the method above “summarizes” the approximate net loss from operations and adds in the purchase “payable” items.)",
