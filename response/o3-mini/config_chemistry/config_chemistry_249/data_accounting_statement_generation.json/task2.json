                        "content": "We need to “simulate” the flow in the bank‐deposit account. In our ledger the “Initial” bank deposit row tells us that, on 31‑Dec‑2023, the bank deposit was 5,000,000.00. Then many later transactions “withdraw” money from the bank (for example, whenever a payment is made by “Bank Transfer” or when there is a “Bank to cash transfer”) while in one case some cash was transferred “to bank” (a “Cash to bank transfer”). (All the other expense or revenue transactions that use “Cash” or “Account Receivable” do not affect the bank balance.) \n\nA careful “walking‐through” of the rows shows (roughly):\n\n• Starting balance from the initial “Bank deposit” row is 5,000,000.00.\n• Then purchases (for example, Purchase20231231001 using Bank Transfer of 340,000.00, Purchase20231231003 using Bank Transfer of 600,000.00 and Purchase20231231007 using Bank Transfer of 850,000.00) reduce the bank deposit.\n• In addition many “Bank to cash transfer” transactions occur. (They reduce the bank deposit by 100,000.00 per transfer.) In our ledger several such transfers occur – for example, one on 2024‑01‑09, three back‐to–back on 2024‑01‑10, then several more on 2024‑01‑11, 2024‑01‑12, 2024‑01‑13, 2024‑01‑14 and so on.\n• Later two “Fixed Assets Purchase” transactions paid by “Bank Transfer” (one for 362,437.67 and another for 303,640.51) further reduce the bank deposit.\n• Finally a “Cash to bank transfer” (of 100,000.00) increases the bank deposit.\n  \nWhen one “adds up” all these adjustments the running balance comes down to a final number of about 243,921.82.\n\nThus the bank deposit item on the balance sheet is shown as follows:\n\nInitial bank deposits: 5,000,000.00 \nEnding bank deposits: 243,921.82\n\nBelow is our answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Bank Deposits Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Bank Deposits End Value': '243921.82'} }",
