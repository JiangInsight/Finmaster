In our chart the only entries that “build up” accounts payable are Purchase entries that were not paid but recorded using the company’s account‐payable method. In our file two purchase entries meet these conditions:\n\n1. The transaction with id Purchase20231231005 shows an amount of 460,000.0 and is marked “Unpaid” with its payment_method as “Account Payable.”\n2. The transaction with id Purchase20231231008 shows an amount of 800,000.0 and is also “Unpaid” with payment_method “Account Payable.”\n\nSince none of the other purchase transactions use “Account Payable” (or later get paid and thus reduce the balance), the net Increase in Accounts Payable is simply the sum of these two amounts:\n\n  460,000.0 + 800,000.0 = 1,260,000.0\n\nThus the final “Increase in Accounts Payable” item is 1,260,000.00.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"1260000.00\"}}",
