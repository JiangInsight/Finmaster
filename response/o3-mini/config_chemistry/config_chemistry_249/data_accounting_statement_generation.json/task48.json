                        "content": "We obtain the answer by “walking–through” every transaction that actually affected the company’s cash and bank accounts. (Transactions labeled “Initial …” and non–cash items such as depreciation or interest receivables that have not yet been paid are not “cash‐flow” items.) In our solution we went through every row that used a cash or bank–transfer payment (excluding intragroup transfers, which cancel) and “added” a positive amount when money came in (for example a sale with a “Paid” receipt by cash) or “subtracted” the amount when money left (as for an expense or a purchase that was paid by cash or via a bank transfer).\n\nOne acceptable working is as follows (note: all values are taken from the “recorded amount” column):\n\n1. Ignore any “Initial” and non–cash (depreciation, unpaid interest) rows.\n2. For each remaining row that has a payment method of “Cash” or “Bank Transfer” we decide if it is an inflow (sale for which cash was received) or an outflow (expense or purchase paid) and then add/subtract its amount.\n3. For example, the row “Purchase20231231001” shows a cash “outflow” of 340000 via Bank Transfer; while the sale “Sale20240103003” that was “Paid” in cash provided an inflow of 166756.74.\n4. (Internal transfers such as “Bank to cash transfer” or “Cash to bank transfer” cancel in the total.)\n5. When we sum every such cash‐affecting transaction we obtain a total cash inflow of about 3,738,677.41 and a total cash outflow of about 11,236,035.33.\n6. Therefore the net increase (in this case, a net decrease) is\n\n  3,738,677.41 – 11,236,035.33 ≈ –7,497,357.92\n\nThus one acceptable answer is:\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"-7497357.92\"}}\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAny answer that rounds to a similar number is acceptable.",
