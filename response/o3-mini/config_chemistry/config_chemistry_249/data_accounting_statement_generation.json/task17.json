                        "content": "We end up “zeroing‐out” any beginning earnings (from the “Initial…” rows) and then “rolling–up” the net effect (the “profit” from sales (positive) together with all the expenses, depreciation and interest amounts – with expenses and depreciation “reducing” earnings and interest receipts “adding” to earnings). In our work the net effect computed over the period comes out to be a loss of about 1,671,901.49. (In other words, if no prior retained earnings existed then the final retained earnings is –1,671,901.49.)\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"-1671901.49\"}}\n\nBelow is a brief outline of the reasoning:\n\n1. Only “operating” items affect retained earnings. (The three “Initial” lines set up the balance‐sheet but do not contribute to revenue or expense.)  \n2. Sales transactions carry a “profit” figure – these add income.  \n3. Expense items – including “Administrative Expenses”, “Sales Expenses”, “Financial Expenses” and “Depreciation” – are subtracted, and similarly adjustments from “Interest Receivables” (interest income) are added (or subtracted if negative).  \n4. Purchases, transfers, and fixed asset acquisitions (which are balance–sheet items) are not “recognised” for net income.\n5. The sum of the “profit” contributions from sales and interest (positive items) minus the expense-related amounts turns out to be –1,671,901.49.\n6. Since no beginning retained earnings exists (starting at 0.00), the ending retained earnings is –1,671,901.49.\n\nThat result is reported as follows:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"-1671901.49\"}}\n\nThis is our final answer.",
