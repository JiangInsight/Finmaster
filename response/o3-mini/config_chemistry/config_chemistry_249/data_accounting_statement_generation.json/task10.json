                        "content": "We need to look only for transactions that affect the “property, plant and non‐current assets” balance. In our data the only items that belong to that class are:\n\n1. The beginning “Fixed Assets” balance from the initial record:\n  • \"Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets\": 5,000,000.00\n\n2. Fixed asset additions (acquisitions made on 2023‑12‑31 with a fixed asset record type):\n  • A “Fixed Assets Purchase” for “Storage Facilities4” amounting to 362,437.67\n  • A “Fixed Assets Purchase” for “Processing Equipment5” amounting to 303,640.51\n\n3. Depreciation expense entries (which reduce the net carrying value of fixed assets):\n  • A depreciation transaction on 2024‑01‑01 for 45,748.20\n  • A depreciation transaction on 2024‑02‑01 for 54,491.69\n\nStep‑by‑step, we do the following:\n\nA. The “initial (book) value” of the non‐current assets is taken from the “Initial Fixed Assets” record:\n  Initial = 5,000,000.00\n\nB. Next, add the two fixed asset purchases:\n  Addition = 362,437.67 + 303,640.51 = 666,078.18\n\nC. Sum both depreciation items:\n  Total Depreciation = 45,748.20 + 54,491.69 = 100,239.89\n\nD. Then the “final (net) value” will be the initial amount plus acquisitions minus depreciation:\n  Final = 5,000,000.00 + 666,078.18 – 100,239.89\n     = 5,666,078.18 – 100,239.89\n     = 5,565,838.29\n\nWe then present our answer with two‑decimal formatting.\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"5565838.29\"\n  }\n}",
