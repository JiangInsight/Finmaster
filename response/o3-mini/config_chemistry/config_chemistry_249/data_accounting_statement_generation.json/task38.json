                        "content": "We must “build” the ending balance in accounts receivable from the credit‐sales transactions. In our data only sale documents that use “Account Receviable” (or “Account Receivable”) as the receive method create a receivable (provided they are “Unpaid”). (Sales whose receive_method is “Cash” are collected immediately.) Thus, we need to add up the amounts of all sale transactions that were made on credit.\n\nBelow we list the transaction amounts (the “amount” column) for every sale where the receive_method is “Account Receviable” (and typically the payment/receipt_status is “Unpaid”):\n\n• Sale20240104004: 349,296.60  \n• Sale20240105005: 44,250.22  \n• Sale20240107009: 227,163.12  \n• Sale20240108011: 134,712.58  \n• Sale20240109012: 561,752.55  \n• Sale20240113021: 115,227.49  \n• Sale20240114023: 304,144.80  \n• Sale20240114024: 12,908.24  \n• Sale20240115026: 23,326.93  \n• Sale20240117030: 47,872.60  \n• Sale20240119034: 41,627.94  \n• Sale20240120036: 556,562.30  \n• Sale20240122041: 48,657.34  \n• Sale20240124044: 12,903.89  \n• Sale20240126048: 25,576.40  \n• Sale20240129052: 264,497.76  \n• Sale20240129053: 51,823.64  \n• Sale20240130054: 122,266.78  \n• Sale20240130055: 25,115.39  \n• Sale20240131057: 128,337.12  \n\nWhen we sum these amounts step‐by‐step we get\n\n 349,296.60  \n+ 44,250.22 = 393,546.82  \n+ 227,163.12 = 620,709.94  \n+ 134,712.58 = 755,422.52  \n+ 561,752.55 = 1,317,175.07  \n+ 115,227.49 = 1,432,402.56  \n+ 304,144.80 = 1,736,547.36  \n+ 12,908.24 = 1,749,455.60  \n+ 23,326.93 = 1,772,782.53  \n+ 47,872.60 = 1,820,655.13  \n+ 41,627.94 = 1,862,283.07  \n+ 556,562.30 = 2,418,845.37  \n+ 48,657.34 = 2,467,502.71  \n+ 12,903.89 = 2,480,406.60  \n+ 25,576.40 = 2,505,983.00  \n+ 264,497.76 = 2,770,480.76  \n+ 51,823.64 = 2,822,304.40  \n+ 122,266.78 = 2,944,571.18  \n+ 25,115.39 = 2,969,686.57  \n+ 128,337.12 = 3,098,023.69  \n\nBecause there was no beginning balance for AR (none is given among the initial transactions) the ending balance (and in a cash flow statement the change in AR is used) is an increase of 3,098,023.69. In operating cash flow presentation an increase in AR is a use of cash (i.e. a “decrease” in operating CF). Therefore the final line item is shown as a negative number, namely –3,098,023.69.\n\nAccordingly, we present the final answer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-3098023.69'} }\n```",
