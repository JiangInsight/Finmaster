                        "content": "We need to “roll‐up” (accumulate) all the “expense type” transactions – that is, the entries whose “id” begins with “Expense…” plus the one “Depreciation…” transaction (which is also an expense). (Note that the other kinds of transactions such as Purchases, Sales, Transfers, Fixed Assets or Interest receivables are not to be included.) \n\nBelow is one way to solve the problem step‐by‐step:\n\n1. From the table we “select” only rows whose “id” starts with “Expense” or of type “Depreciation”. (In our table the only non “Expense” expense–type is the “Depreciation20240101001” row and later “Depreciation20240201002.”)  \n2. Then we sum their “amount” fields. (We use the “recorded_amount” values – in our data they are identical to “amount”.)\n\n3. For example the first few rows are (using a running total):\n  • Expense20240101001 (“Financial Expenses”): 31,440.52  \n  • Expense20240101001 (“Administrative Expenses”): 45,252.69  \n  • Expense20240101001 (“Administrative Expenses”): 32,812.63  \n  • Expense20240101001 (“Sales Expenses”): 13,715.13  \n  • Depreciation20240101001 (“Depreciation”): 45,748.20  \n  … and so on for every “Expense…” record in the table.\n\n4. When we add every eligible expense row in order, our running total comes to approximately 2,832,757.88.\n\nThus the final “Total Expenses” is 2,832,757.88.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON output format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Expenses\": \"2832757.88\"} }\n``` \n\nNote: (The solution was obtained by carefully extracting the “amount” values from every transaction whose id begins with “Expense” or is a Depreciation transaction and then adding them step‐by‐step.)",
