(In other words, one “constructs” the income statement from only the income‐statement transactions.) \n\nIn our case the complete work–when done carefully step–leads to a net “profit before tax” of about –1,698,901.49.\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Profit Before Tax\": \"-1698901.49\"} } \n\nBelow is a brief outline of the reasoning:\n\n1. We ignore “Initial …”, “Purchase …”, “FixedAsset …” and “Transfer …” rows; these affect only the balance sheet.\n2. We include transactions whose type is “Sale”, “Expense”, “Depreciation” or “Interest Receivables.”\n3. For “Sale” rows the “profit” (computed as after‐tax amount less cost amount) is given.\n4. For each “Expense” row the “amount” is taken as a cost (negative effect).\n5. We add “Interest Receivables” amounts (when positive) to “revenues” – and note that sometimes these may even be negative.\n6. The sum of all “Sale profit” plus “interest revenues” minus the sum of all “Expense,” “Depreciation” (and similar) gives the final profit before tax.\n7. When all the numbers are combined (as shown in the long step‐by‐step running total calculation above), the net result is a negative number: approximately –1,698,901.49.\n\nThus, our final answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Profit Before Tax\": \"-1698901.49\"} }",
