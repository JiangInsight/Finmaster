                        "content": "We must “build up” the inventory by “adding in” all the purchases of finished goods (which add inventory) and then “reducing” the inventory by the cost of goods that have been “sold” later during the period. In our case the only “Initial” journal entries are for cash, bank, fixed assets, etc. (none of which are “inventory‐type” assets) so we take the inventory at period start as zero. Then we scan the transactions in the period which change our inventory.\n\nStep 1. Identify the purchase transactions that add inventory. For each we have a “Purchase” line in which a chemical product is bought. (We ignore other non–product entries.) Their amounts (the “recorded_amount” on the line) are calculated as “quantity × cost per unit.” In our data these purchases are (all dated 2023‑12‑31):\n\n• Purchase20231231001: 17 units of P002 at 20,000 → 17×20,000 = 340,000  \n• Purchase20231231002: 19 units of P004 at 100,000 → 19×100,000 = 1,900,000  \n• Purchase20231231003: 12 units of P003 at 50,000 → 12×50,000 = 600,000  \n• Purchase20231231004: 26 units of P001 at 10,000 → 26×10,000 = 260,000  \n• Purchase20231231005: 23 units of P002 at 20,000 → 23×20,000 = 460,000  \n• Purchase20231231006: 9 units of P003 at 50,000 → 9×50,000 = 450,000  \n• Purchase20231231007: 17 units of P003 at 50,000 → 17×50,000 = 850,000  \n• Purchase20231231008: 16 units of P003 at 50,000 → 16×50,000 = 800,000  \n• Purchase20231231009: 8 units of P004 at 100,000 → 8×100,000 = 800,000  \n• Purchase20231231010: 15 units of P004 at 100,000 → 15×100,000 = 1,500,000  \n• Purchase20231231011: 22 units of P003 at 50,000 → 22×50,000 = 1,100,000  \n• Purchase20231231012: 6 units of P001 at 10,000 → 6×10,000 = 60,000  \n\nWhen we sum these numbers we have:  \n 340,000 + 1,900,000 = 2,240,000  \n + 600,000 = 2,840,000  \n + 260,000 = 3,100,000  \n + 460,000 = 3,560,000  \n + 450,000 = 4,010,000  \n + 850,000 = 4,860,000  \n + 800,000 = 5,660,000  \n + 800,000 = 6,460,000  \n + 1,500,000 = 7,960,000  \n + 1,100,000 = 8, + 60,000 → finally 9,120,000  \n\nSo total inventory purchased = 9,120,000.\n\nStep 2. Now we identify the “Sale” transactions that reduce the inventory. In each sale we see that along with the sale amount there is a “cost_amount” entry (that is the cost of the product taken from inventory). We then subtract all these cost amounts from the purchase total. (Below are the sale transactions that include inventory product details – note that only the product–related sales should “remove” inventory.)\n\nThe sale transactions (with cost_amount in parentheses) are:\n\n1. Sale20240103003: cost_amount = 150,000  \n2. Sale20240104004: cost_amount = 250,000  \n3. Sale20240105005: cost_amount = 40,000  \n4. Sale20240106006: cost_amount = 200,000  \n5. Sale20240106007: cost_amount = 500,000  \n6. Sale20240107009: cost_amount = 200,000  \n7. Sale20240108010: cost_amount = 250,000  \n8. Sale20240108011: cost_amount = 100,000  \n9. Sale20240109012: cost_amount = 500,000  \n10. Sale20240110013: cost_amount = 10,000  \n11. Sale20240110014: cost_amount = 200,000  \n12. Sale20240111016: cost_amount = 20,000  \n13. Sale20240112019: cost_amount = 20,000  \n14. Sale20240112020: cost_amount = 200,000  \n15. Sale20240113021: cost_amount = 100,000  \n16. Sale20240113022: cost_amount = 10,000  \n17. Sale20240114023: cost_amount = 250,000  \n18. Sale20240114024: cost_amount = 10,000  \n19. Sale20240115025: cost_amount = 200,000  \n20. Sale20240115026: cost_amount = 20,000  \n21. Sale20240116028: cost_amount = 100,000  \n22. Sale20240117029: cost_amount = 200,000  \n23. Sale20240117030: cost_amount = 40,000  \n24. Sale20240118032: cost_amount = 20,000  \n25. Sale20240119034: cost_amount = 30,000  \n26. Sale20240119035: cost_amount = 100,000  \n27. Sale20240120036: cost_amount = 250,000  \n28. Sale20240121038: cost_amount = 80,000  \n29. Sale20240122040: cost_amount = 250,000  \n30. Sale20240122041: cost_amount = 40,000  \n31. Sale20240123042: cost_amount = 200,000  \n32. Sale20240123043: cost_amount = 20,000  \n33. Sale20240124044: cost_amount = 10,000  \n34. Sale20240124045: cost_amount = 200,000  \n35. Sale20240125047: cost_amount = 200,000  \n36. Sale20240126048: cost_amount = 20,000  \n37. Sale20240129052: cost_amount = 200,000  \n38. Sale20240129053: cost_amount = 40,000  \n39. Sale20240130054: cost_amount = 100,000  \n40. Sale20240130055: cost_amount = 20,000  \n41. Sale20240131057: cost_amount = 100,000  \n\nNow adding these up step by step:\n\n• (150,000 + 250,000) = 400,000  \n• + 40,000 = 440,000  \n• + 200,000 = 640,000  \n• + 500,000 = 1,140,000  \n• + 200,000 = 1,340,000  \n• + 250,000 = 1,590,000  \n• + 100,000 = 1,690,000  \n• + 500,000 = 2,190,000  \n• + 10,000 = 2,200,000  \n• + 200,000 = 2,400,000  \n• + 20,000 = 2,420,000  \n• + 20,000 = 2,440,000  \n• + 200,000 = 2,640,000  \n• + 100,000 = 2,740,000  \n• + 10,000 = 2,750,000  \n• + 250,000 = 3,000,000  \n• + 10,000 = 3,010,000  \n• + 200,000 = 3,210,000  \n• + 20,000 = 3,230,000  \n• + 100,000 = 3,330,000  \n• + 200,000 = 3,530,000  \n• + 40,000 = 3,570,000  \n• + 20,000 = 3,590,000  \n• + 30,000 = 3,620,000  \n• + 100,000 = 3,720,000  \n• + 250,000 = 3,970,000  \n• + 80,000 = 4,050,000  \n• + 250,000 = 4,300,000  \n• + 40,000 = 4,340,000  \n• + 200,000 = 4,540,000  \n• + 20,000 = 4,560,000  \n• + 10,000 = 4,570,000  \n• + 200,000 = 4,770,000  \n• + 200,000 = 4,970,000  \n• + 20,000 = 4,990,000  \n• + 200,000 = 5,190,000  \n• + 40,000 = 5,230,000  \n• + 100,000 = 5,330,000  \n• + 20,000 = 5,350,000  \n• + 100,000 = 5,450,000  \n\nThus the total cost of goods sold (COGS) is 5,450,000.\n\nStep 3. Compute the ending inventory value:\n\nEnding Inventory = (Total Purchases) – (Total COGS)\n  = 9,120,000 – 5,450,000\n  = 3,670,000\n\nAlso, since no beginning inventory was given (none of the “Initial…” transactions relate to inventory) we assume:\nInitial Inventory Value = 0.00\n\nTherefore our answer is:\n\nInventory Initial Value = 0.00  \nInventory End Value = 3,670,000.00\n\nWe now provide the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\nBelow is our final output:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Inventory End Value\": \"3670000.00\"} }",
