                        "content": "We “build” accounts receivable by “collecting” – from all sale‐transactions in which the “receive_method” is “Account Receviable” and also the “Interest” items whose “receive_method” is “Interest receviable.” (In our business records the customers sometimes buy “on‐credit” and also interest is separately recorded; until these receivables are collected the balance “outstanding” is reported in the balance sheet.) \n\nIn our “Problem to Solve” the opening (“initial”) balance for AR is zero (there is no beginning receivables balance on 2023‑12‑31). Then if we “scan” the transactions we find many Sales whose “receive_method” is “Account Receviable” with status “Unpaid” (none show a payment to reduce AR) and – separately – several “Interest Receivables” lines (all Unpaid) that are part of the receivables pool. \n\nFor example, one sample sale (Sale20240104004) is recorded as follows:\n • amount = 349296.6 \n • cost_per_unit = 50000.0 \n • receive_method = Account Receviable \n • after_tax_amount = 331831.77 \nso this “sale on credit” contributes 331831.77 to accounts receivable.\n\nLikewise, by scanning all “Sale” records with “receive_method” = “Account Receviable” we obtain the following “after‑tax” amounts:\n  • Sale20240104004: 331831.77 \n  • Sale20240105005: 42037.71 \n  • Sale20240107009: 215804.96 \n  • Sale20240108011: 127976.95 \n  • Sale20240109012: 533664.92 \n  • Sale20240113021: 109466.12 \n  • Sale20240114023: 288937.56 \n  • Sale20240114024: 12262.83 \n  • Sale20240115026: 22160.58 \n  • Sale20240117030: 45478.97 \n  • Sale20240119034: 39546.54 \n  • Sale20240120036: 528734.18 \n  • Sale20240122041: 46224.47 \n  • Sale20240124044: 12258.70 \n  • Sale20240126048: 24297.58 \n  • Sale20240129052: 251272.87 \n  • Sale20240129053: 49232.46 \n  • Sale20240130054: 116153.44 \n  • Sale20240130055: 23859.62 \n  • Sale20240131057: 121920.26 \n\nSumming these in “groups” you eventually get a subtotal of 2,943,122.49.\n\nNext, the “Interest Receivables” (all have receive_method “Interest receviable”) add up to about 5,155.29.\n\nThus the combined ending “accounts receivable” is approximately:\n\n  2,943,122.49 + 5,155.29 ≈ 2,948,277.78\n\nSince there was no beginning receivables balance, the “initial” AR remains 0.00.\n\nWe now report our answer in the required json format.\n\n(Note: In an actual computerized system the “accounts receivable” on the balance sheet is computed exactly from the outstanding credit‐sales and interest amounts that have not been “collected.”)\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"2948277.78\"\n  }\n}",
