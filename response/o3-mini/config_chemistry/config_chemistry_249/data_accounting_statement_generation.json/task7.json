                        "content": "We need to identify the “Fixed Assets” starting balance and then update it with any acquisitions (increases) and subtract any depreciation (reductions) that have been posted during the period.\n\nStep 1. Identify the initial fixed asset balance.  \n• Look at the “Initial20231231001” row with type “Fixed Assets”. Its amount is 5,000,000.00. This is the beginning fixed asset value.\n\nStep 2. Look for additional fixed asset acquisitions.  \n• We have two rows with a type that indicates a fixed asset purchase:  \n – One row dated 2023‑12‑31 with id “FixedAsset20231231001” and asset_name “Storage Facilities4” with amount = 362,437.67.  \n – Another row (again with the id “FixedAsset20231231001”) but later in the file with asset_name “Processing Equipment5” with amount = 303,640.51.  \nTheir total addition is:  \n 362,437.67 + 303,640.51 = 666,078.18.\n\nStep 3. Look for depreciation events that reduce the fixed asset balance.  \n• There is a depreciation row “Depreciation20240101001” with an amount = 45,748.20  \n• Also, another depreciation row “Depreciation20240201002” with amount = 54,491.69  \nTheir total depreciation is:  \n 45,748.20 + 54,491.69 = 100,239.89.\n\nStep 4. Calculate the ending fixed assets value.  \nStart with the initial fixed asset value, add the acquisitions, then subtract the total depreciation:  \n\n Fixed Assets End Value = 5,000,000.00 + 666,078.18 – 100,239.89  \n  = 5,666,078.18 – 100,239.89  \n  = 5,565,838.29\n\nStep 5. Format the result  \nWe present the answer with two amounts rounded to two decimals.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"5565838.29\"\n  }\n}",
