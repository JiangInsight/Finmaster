                        "content": "We “sell” items purchased in earlier periods. In many transactions the “Sale” rows already list a “cost_amount” (which is exactly the quantity sold multiplied by the cost per unit from that product’s purchase history). (For example, one sale of 3 units of Chemical Product C has a cost_amount of 150000.0 – i.e. each unit cost 50000.) \n\nA quick “walk‐through” of the steps is as follows:\n\n1. Identify all sale–type transactions (the rows whose “type” is “Sale”). In each such row the “cost_amount” column reports the cost imbedded in that sale (i.e. the cost of the inventory that is being “sold”).\n2. Sum the “cost_amount” over all such sale transactions. (For example, if you add up the numbers – 150000.0, 250000.0, 40000.0, 200000.0, 500000.0, … etc – you end up with a total of 5,700,000.00.)\n3. That grand total is then taken as the “Cost of Goods Sold” (COGS) for the period.\n\nBased on the provided transactions, the final calculated cost of goods sold comes out to be 5,700,000.00.\n\nThus, the answer in the expected JSON output is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"5700000.00\"\n  }\n}",
