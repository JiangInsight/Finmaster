                        "content": "Let's calculate each ratio step by step.\n\n1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n• Use the formula:  \n  Accounts Receivable Turnover = Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n• The ending Accounts Receivable is 3,098,023.69 and the beginning value (from 2023‑12‑31) is 0.00.  \n  Average AR = (0.00 + 3,098,023.69) / 2 = 1,549,011.845  \n• Revenue (Main Business Revenue) = 6,836,701.10  \n• Thus, AR Turnover = 6,836,701.10 / 1,549,011.845 ≈ 4.41  \n\n2. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n• Use the formula:  \n  Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n• From the cash flow statement, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –6,856,840.58  \n• From the balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08  \n• Ratio = –6,856,840.58 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ –4.28  \n\n3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n• In many analyses, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is taken the same way as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities ratio.  \n• Therefore, using the same numbers, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is also ≈ –4.28  \n\n4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n• Use the formula:  \n  Total Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average Total Assets  \n• Total Assets at beginning (2023‑12‑31) = 13,000,000.00  \n• Total Assets at ending (2024‑02‑01) = 12,566,098.56  \n  Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 12,566,098.56) / 2 = 12,783,049.28  \n• Thus, Total Asset Turnover = 6,836,701.10 / 12,783,049.28 ≈ 0.53  \n\n5. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n• Use the formula:  \n  Debt to Equity = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity  \n• Total Liabilities (here, we take the Total Current Liabilities as no other liabilities are listed) = 1,601,835.08  \n• Total Owner’s Equity (end amount) = 10,964,263.48  \n• Ratio = 1,601,835.08 / 10,964,263.48 ≈ 0.15  \n\nNow we present the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"4.41\", \n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-4.28\", \n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-4.28\", \n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.53\", \n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.15\"\n  }\n}",
