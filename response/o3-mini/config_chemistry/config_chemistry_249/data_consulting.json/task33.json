                        "content": "We first extract the numbers from the three statements. Note that the formulas we use (all based on the End_amount amounts) are:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Current Liabilities)  \n  = –6,856,840.58 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ –4.28\n\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Debt)  \n  Here we use Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities (since no non‐current liabilities are provided)  \n  = –6,856,840.58 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ –4.28\n\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio = (Cost of Goods Sold) / (Average Inventory)  \n  Average Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2  \n  The beginning inventory is 0 and the ending inventory is 3,420,000.00 so Average Inventory = (0 + 3,420,000.00)/2 = 1,710,000.00  \n  Thus, Inventory Turnover = 5,700,000.00 / 1,710,000.00 ≈ 3.33\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio = (Total Liabilities) / (Total Owner’s Equity)  \n  Total Liabilities here is the current liabilities: 1,601,835.08  \n  Total Owner’s Equity = 10,964,263.48  \n  Thus, Debt to Equity = 1,601,835.08 / 10,964,263.48 ≈ 0.15\n\n5. Quick Ratio = (Total Current Assets – Inventory) / (Total Current Liabilities)  \n  = (7,000,260.27 – 3,420,000.00) / 1,601,835.08  \n  = 3,580,260.27 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ 2.23\n\n6. Current Ratio = (Total Current Assets) / (Total Current Liabilities)  \n  = 7,000,260.27 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ 4.37\n\nThus, the final solution in the requested json format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-4.28\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-4.28\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"3.33\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.15\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"2.23\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"4.37\"\n  }\n}",
