                        "content": "We start by calculating the two ratios from the provided data.\n\n1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n a. From the balance sheet, the combined Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity is 12,566,098.56. The Total Owner’s Equity is given as 10,964,263.48. Therefore, the total liabilities (debt) can be computed as:\n  Total Liabilities = Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity – Total Owner’s Equity\n    = 12,566,098.56 – 10,964,263.48 \n    = 1,601,835.08\n b. The Total Assets at period end is given as 12,566,098.56. Thus, the Debt to Asset Ratio becomes:\n  Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n    = 1,601,835.08 / 12,566,098.56 ≈ 0.12745\n Rounded to two decimal places, this ratio is approximately 0.13.\n\n2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n a. From the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is provided as –6,856,840.58.\n b. The income statement shows the Net Profit as –2,035,736.52.\n c. The Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is thus computed as:\n  = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Net Profit)\n  = (–6,856,840.58) / (–2,035,736.52) ≈ 3.366\n Rounded to two decimal places, this ratio is approximately 3.37.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.13\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"3.37\"\n  }\n}",
