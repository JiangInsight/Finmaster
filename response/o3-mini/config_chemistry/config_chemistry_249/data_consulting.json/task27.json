                        "content": "We first extract the key numbers from the three statements and then compute the three ratios step by step.\n\n───────────────────────────────  \n1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n• From the cash‐flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is –6,856,840.58.  \n• From the income statement, the Net Profit is –2,035,736.52.\n\nEven though both numbers are negative, taking their ratio gives a positive number because a “more negative” cash flow (in absolute terms) relative to net loss will result in a positive ratio.\n\nCalculation:  \n  Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Net Profit)  \n    = (–6,856,840.58) / (–2,035,736.52)  \n    ≈ 3.37\n\n───────────────────────────────  \n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\nThis ratio is computed as Total Revenue divided by the average current assets. The example shows that the “initial” amount on the balance sheet is treated as the beginning current assets and the “end” amount as the ending current assets.\n\n• Total Revenue from the income statement = 6,836,701.10  \n• Beginning Current Assets (from balance sheet, initial) = 8,000,000.00  \n• Ending Current Assets = 7,000,260.27  \n\nAverage Current Assets = (8,000,000.00 + 7,000,260.27) / 2  \n  = 15,000,260.27 / 2  \n  ≈ 7,500,130.14\n\nThen,  \n  Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Current Assets  \n    = 6,836,701.10 / 7,500,130.14  \n    ≈ 0.91\n\n───────────────────────────────  \n3. Quick Ratio\n\nThe quick (acid-test) ratio is calculated as (Cash equivalents + Accounts Receivable and other receivables) divided by current liabilities. It excludes inventories.\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):  \n• Cash equivalents (Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits) = 376,598.62 + 100,482.62 = 477,081.24  \n• Interest Receivable = 5,155.34  \n• Accounts Receivable = 3,098,023.69  \n\nSum of quick assets = 477,081.24 + 5,155.34 + 3,098,023.69  \n  = 3,580,260.27\n\n• Total Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08\n\nNow,  \n  Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \n    = 3,580,260.27 / 1,601,835.08  \n    ≈ 2.23\n\n───────────────────────────────  \nThus, the final answers are:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '3.37', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.91', 'Quick Ratio': '2.23'}}",
