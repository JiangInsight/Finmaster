Since the liabilities in these examples consist solely of current liabilities (Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable), we add these up:\n\n• Accounts Payable = 1,260,000.00  \n• Taxes Payable = 341,835.08  \n• Total Debt = 1,260,000.00 + 341,835.08 = 1,601,835.08\n\nNext, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is calculated as:  \n  Ratio = (Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Debt)  \n    = –6,856,840.58 / 1,601,835.08  \n    ≈ –4.28\n\nThus, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately –4.28.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-4.28\"}\n}",
