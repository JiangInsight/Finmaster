This is shown as \"Paid-in Capital\" with an End_amount of 13000000.00.\n2. From the income statement, we need the profit or loss for the period before deducting tax expense, which is given as \"Profit Before Tax\" with an Amount of -1010139.34.\n3. From the cash flow statement, we need the addition in the amount owed by the entity, represented by the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" line item with an Amount of 2100000.00.\n\nThus, grouping by the order (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement), the solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value1\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"value2\": \"-1010139.34\",\n    \"value3\": \"2100000.00\"\n  }\n}",
