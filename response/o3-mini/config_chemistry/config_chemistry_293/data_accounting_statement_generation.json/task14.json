                        "content": "We first must decide which transactions – out of all the entries – in the “trial‐balance” affect “current liabilities.” (In “stand‑alone” bookkeeping the beginning/inception “initial” entries often record the owners’ investment, assets and fixed assets but no liabilities.) In our case the only “current liabilities” come from those purchase transactions where payment has not been made (and the method is shown as “Account Payable”). (Note that “Interest Receivables” are normally assets rather than liabilities and that expense entries are “paid” so do not build up a liability.)\n\nStep‑by‑step:\n\n1. The “Initial” entries (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) are all asset accounts. They do not record any current liabilities so the beginning (initial) balance of current liabilities is 0.00.\n\n2. Go through the “Purchase” transactions. In our file there are several “Purchase” entries but most show “Paid” as payment/receipt_status. Out of the several Purchase rows only those where the status is “Unpaid” (and often the payment method is “Account Payable”) represent amounts that the company has not yet paid – that is, current liabilities.\n\n3. In our file there are exactly two relevant purchase transactions:\n • Purchase20231231009 shows an amount of 800000.0 and its payment method is “Account Payable” with status “Unpaid.”\n • Purchase20231231012 shows an amount of 1300000.0 (again “Unpaid” with the payment method “Account Payable”).\n \n4. The total liability coming from these two unpaid purchases is:\n  800000.0 + 1300000.0 = 2100000.0\n\n5. None of the other transactions (such as sales or expenses) generate a liability because either they are “paid” or they represent revenues or asset transactions.\n\nThus the answer is:\n\nInitial current liabilities: 0.00 \nFinal (end‑period) current liabilities: 2100000.00\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"2100000.00\"\n  }\n}\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the final computed answer based on the given transaction data.",
