We also disregarded internal transfers (bank‐to‐cash or cash‐to‐bank) since they do not affect the consolidated cash balance. When these items were all summed the net change came out to be an increase of roughly 18,541.99.\n\nNote that slight rounding differences may occur but the final answer is as given above.",
