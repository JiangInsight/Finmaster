                        "content": "We can “close‐the books” for the month by thinking in broad strokes about how the “balance sheet” side (liabilities plus owners’ equity) will change from the “initial” situation (the three “initial” investment rows) by “adding” the results of all operating activity and “adding” any obligations that remain unpaid.\n\nIn our example the three rows on 2023–12–31 give\n\n  Cash deposit   3,000,000.00  \n  Bank deposit   5,000,000.00  \n  Fixed Assets   5,000,000.00  \n  –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  \n  Initial total = 13,000,000.00\n\nThen over January many transactions occur. (Sales transactions “earn” profit – that is, the “profit” amounts in each Sale row reflect the “net” revenue from that sale, after subtracting its cost; while many Expense entries – including Administrative, Sales and Financial expenses as well as depreciation – work to “drag down” retained earnings.) At the same time some purchase transactions were not settled in cash and (by their “payment/receipt_status” and “payment_method”) are recorded as “Account Payable.” \n\nA rough – step‐by‐step “back‐of‐the‐envelope” summary is as follows:\n\n1. Calculate total “sales profit” by summing the “profit” column over all Sale entries. In our new set of rows that sum comes to roughly 1,469,640.00.\n\n2. Meanwhile, the many “Expense” (plus the Depreciation entry) rows add up to roughly 2,551,850.00. (These “costs” – outflows that hit income – lower retained earnings and so reduce owners’ equity.)\n\n3. Thus the “net income” for the period (as already “closed into” owners’ equity) is about  \n  Net income = (total sales profit) – (total operating expenses)  \n         ≈ 1,469,640.00 – 2,551,850.00  \n         ≈ –1,082,210.00  \n that is, a net loss of roughly 1,082,210.00.\n\n4. In addition, note that among the Purchase entries there are two whose payment status is “Unpaid” and whose “payment_method” is “Account Payable.” Their amounts (800,000.00 and 1,300,000.00) add up to 2,100,000.00. (Such “unsettled” purchases increase liabilities even though the cost of the items eventually “flow” through cost of sales.)\n\n5. Thus the owners’ equity “rolling forward” changes by the net income. Starting from 13,000,000.00 the losses reduce owners’ equity to  \n  13,000,000.00 – 1,082,210.00 = 11,917,790.00  \nand then the “unpaid” items have increased the liabilities side by 2,100,000.00.\n\n6. So the final “balance‐sheet total” as the sum of (owners’ equity + liabilities) is  \n  11,917,790.00 + 2,100,000.00 = 14,017,790.00\n\nThat is, compared with the beginning “balance” of 13,000,000.00 (which – for our purposes – is the “Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value”), the net effect of the month’s sales, expenses and new unpaid obligations is to increase the “balance‐sheet total” to about 14,017,790.00.\n\nThus, in the simplified “trial‐balance” for liabilities and owners’ equity one may report:\n\n{\n  \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \n  \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"14017790.00\"\n}\n\nBelow is our answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"14017790.00\"}}\n``` \n\nNote: (Because the transaction table is long and we must “roll‐up” the effects – the sales “profit” entries add revenue while the many expense entries (including depreciation, administrative, sales and financial expenses) produce an overall loss. Then, when combined with the additional accounts payable from unpaid purchases, the overall “liabilities + owners’ equity” increases from the 13,000,000.00 initially to roughly 14,017,790.00.)",
