                        "content": "We must “build up” the balance‐sheet “Accounts Payable” by adding up all purchase‐related transactions that are still outstanding at period–end. Notice that the “opening” (initial) entries (the “Initial” transactions) are simply used to set up cash, bank and fixed assets; no Accounts Payable appears there. Then, as you scan through the detailed transactions you will see that most purchase transactions are shown with a “Paid” status (and even if they are “Purchase” type, they have been paid already). However, two purchase entries come in which are still “Unpaid” and their payment method is “Account Payable.” These are:\n\n• The transaction with id Purchase20231231009 on 2023‑12‑31 for 800000.0 (with payment method “Account Payable” and status “Unpaid”).\n\n• The transaction with id Purchase20231231012 on 2023‑12‑31 for 1300000.0 (also with payment method “Account Payable” and status “Unpaid”).\n\nBecause no Accounts Payable appeared from “Initial” entries we set the opening (initial) Accounts Payable to 0.00. At period–end the amount outstanding is the sum of those unpaid purchases:\n\n  800000.0 + 1300000.0 = 2100000.0\n\nThus, the answer is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"2100000.00\"\n  }\n}",
