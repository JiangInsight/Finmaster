                        "content": "We must look at all the transactions and “pick out” only those entries that represent money the company still owes (that is, things recorded as liabilities). (Often purchases that have not been paid yet show up as “Unpaid” using an “Account Payable” payment method and thus increase liabilities.) \n\nStep‑by‑step review:\n\n1. The three “Initial” transactions (cash deposit, bank deposit and fixed assets) are “Initial” asset entries, not liabilities. Therefore the beginning liability total is 0.00.\n\n2. Then, scan through the list for any transaction whose type is “Purchase” (or similar) and with a “payment/receipt_status” of “Unpaid” and where the payment method shows “Account Payable.” In our data there are two such rows:\n • Row with id Purchase20231231009 – it shows an amount of 800000.0, “Unpaid” and with “Account Payable.”\n • Row with id Purchase20231231012 – it shows an amount of 1300000.0, “Unpaid” and with “Account Payable.”\n\n3. When these two “Unpaid” purchase transactions are added together:\n  800000.0 + 1300000.0 = 2100000.0\n\n4. No other rows in the dataset show an unpaid amount on the liability side (other “Unpaid” transactions are mostly for items such as interest receivables or sales that are receivables – that is, assets).\n\nThus, the initial liabilities remain 0.00 and at “end” (taking all transactions into account) the total liabilities are 2100000.00.\n\nThe answer is returned in the requested format.\n\nBelow is the final answer in JSON:\n \n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"2100000.00\"\n  }\n}",
