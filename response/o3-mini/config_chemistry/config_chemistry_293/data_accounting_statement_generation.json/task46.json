In the above transaction data you’ll see three “initial” entries dated 2023‑12‑31. Two of these are, in fact, cash (one is labeled “Cash deposit” with 3,000,000.0 and one “Bank deposit” with 5,000,000.0). Although there is a third “Initial” record for “Fixed Assets” with 5,000,000.0, fixed assets are not considered part of cash or cash equivalents because they are non‐liquid long‑term investments.\n\nAdding together only those two cash/cash equivalent items gives us:\n\n  3000000.0 + 5000000.0 = 8000000.0\n\nAll the subsequent transactions (such as expenses, sales, transfers, etc.) are movements during the period. However, for a cash flow statement the “beginning balance” is the amount available at the very start of the period (i.e. usually the ending balance of the previous period) and is not computed by netting those changes; it is simply the cash/cash equivalents available at the start.\n\nThus, the final “beginning cash and cash equivalents balance” is 8,000,000.00.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\"\n  }\n}",
