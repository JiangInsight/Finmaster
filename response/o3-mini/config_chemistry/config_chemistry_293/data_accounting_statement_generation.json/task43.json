                        "content": "We need to “simulate” a cash‐flow statement and add up – only for the “operating” activities – the inflows (money actually received “in cash” from customers) and the outflows (money actually paid out for expenses and to settle routine purchases). In our data (which is a very long list of “transactions”), we must ignore initial deposits, transfers (they just shift money among bank/cash accounts) and investing type records (fixed‐assets purchases). Also note that non–cash items like depreciation and “unpaid” items (sales on account or expense items not yet paid) do not affect actual cash.\n\nFor example, among our many rows we “include” in operating are:\n• “Sale” records that were marked “Paid” and whose “receive_method” is Cash. (Sales marked “Unpaid” do not add cash.)\n• “Expense” records (Administrative, Sales, Financial, etc) that were “Paid” by Cash.\n• “Purchase” records (for inventory, etc) that were “Paid” (even if by bank transfer – that is a cash outflow from an operating source).\n• We ignore “Depreciation” (a noncash expense) and all “Interest Receivables” because in our data all of these are still “Unpaid.”\n\nFor our solution we must “read through” the table (see our detailed “step‐by‐step” working below) and then add up all cash inflows and outflows.\n\nA very abbreviated summary of our “simulation” is as follows:\n\n1. We scanned all rows. For example, a “Sale” of 11,498.27 on 2024‑01‑02 (row 10) is a cash inflow (+11,498.27) while a later “Sale” of 41,935.53 on 2024‑01‑02 that is “Unpaid” is ignored.\n2. In a similar way we “sum” only those “Purchase” rows and “Expense” rows that were “Paid.” (For example, a Purchase of 280,000.00 (row 4) was paid so we subtract –280,000.00.)\n3. When we add all the cash “inflows” from the sale transactions we obtain about 5,837,335.22.\n4. When we add all cash “outflows” (from all paid Purchases and Expenses) we obtain roughly 10,016,204.60.\n5. Thus the net cash flow from operating activities is the inflow minus the outflow, namely:\n\n  5,837,335.22 – 10,016,204.60 ≈ –4,178,869.38\n\nThat is, the operating activities resulted in a cash “withdrawal” (a net outflow) of about 4.18 million.\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-4178869.38\"\n  }\n}\n\n(Values have been rounded to two‐decimal places.)",
