                        "content": "We need to “roll‐up” (i.e. sum up) all the expense‐side amounts (which include rows whose “type” begins with Expense – plus e.g. “Depreciation” rows that are normally embedded as an expense – in this case the only non‐“Expense” row that is to be included is the one with type “Depreciation”) and ignore rows that are purchases, transfers, sales, interest receivables, etc.\n\nBelow is one “manual” breakdown of the process. In our provided data we scan (by row order) for any transaction whose type begins with “Expense” or is “Depreciation.” (For example, the row with id “Depreciation20240101001” is included.) Then we sum the “recorded_amount” values for these rows.\n\nWhen we add up the amounts from all such rows we obtain a final total expense of approximately 2,549,848.96.\n\nThus, in our answer we return:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Expenses\": \"2549848.96\"\n  }\n}\n\nBelow is a brief outline of the “reasoning” (note that there are more than 200 rows in the source data; each “Expense” row – whether “Administrative Expenses”, “Sales Expenses”, “Financial Expenses” etc – is extracted and its amount added; for example, the first three expense rows were 47,223.80, 5,602.39, and 11,317.25; then a Depreciation row with 45,753.36 is added; continuing in this fashion over all eligible rows the final summation is 2,549,848.96).\n\nThe final answer is provided in the JSON format requested.\n\nBelow is the final answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n––––––––––––––\n  \nRemember: we ignore types like “Purchase”, “Sale”, “Transfer”, “Interest Receivables”, “Initial …”, “Fixed Assets Purchase” because they are not “operating expense” items.\n\nThe final result is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Expenses\": \"2549848.96\"\n  }\n}",
