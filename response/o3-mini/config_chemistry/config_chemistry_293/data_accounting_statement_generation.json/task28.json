In the data below, only lines whose type is Sales Expenses contribute to that total. (Note that other expense types such as “Financial Expenses” or “Administrative Expenses” are ignored.)\n\nStep‐by‐step, we extract the amounts from each Sales Expenses row:\n\n1. Row (2024-01-01, Sales Expenses): 5602.39 \n2. Row (2024-01-04, Sales Expenses): 21353.44 \n3. Row (2024-01-05, Sales Expenses): 34376.89 \n4. Row (2024-01-07, Sales Expenses): 33506.69 \n5. Row (2024-01-09, Sales Expenses): 12240.16 \n6. Row (2024-01-11, Sales Expenses): 16297.63 \n7. Row (2024-01-12, Sales Expenses): 49729.94 \n8. Row (2024-01-13, Sales Expenses): 49423.87 \n9.
