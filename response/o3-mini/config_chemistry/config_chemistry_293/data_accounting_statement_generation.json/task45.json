In a cash‐flow statement the investing section normally reflects cash flows related to the purchase or sale of long‐lived assets. (The “initial” balance entries for cash and bank funds are balance‐sheet opening balances, not “flows” in investing.) In our data the only transaction that “moves cash” in relation to a fixed asset is the one where a fixed asset is actually purchased.\n\nLooking through the “type” field we see:\n\n• Three “Initial20231231001” lines. They record the initial deposit of cash, bank deposit, and the “Fixed Assets” balance. (These three are “opening” balances and do not represent a cash flow transaction in investing.)\n\n• There is one transaction with type “Fixed Assets Purchase” (the id is “FixedAsset20231231001”) with an amount of 324677.57. (This is the cash expenditure on a long‑lived asset and belongs in the investing section.) \n\nNone of the other “Purchase” transactions are for fixed assets (they are for raw materials or inventory) and none of the “Transfer” transactions (bank‐to‐cash or cash‑to‑bank) or “Expense” transactions affect investing activities.\n\nThus the only investing cash flow is the cash outflow for the fixed assets purchase. (By convention cash used to acquire fixed assets is shown as a negative number.) \n\nTherefore, the net cash flow from investing activities is –324677.57.\n\nThe resulting answer in the requested json format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-324677.57\"\n  }\n}",
