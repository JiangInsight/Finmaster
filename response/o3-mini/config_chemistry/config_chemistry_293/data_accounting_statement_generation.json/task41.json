For many “Purchase” transactions the “payment/receipt_status” is “Paid” (for example, Purchase20231231001, …, Purchase20231231008, Purchase20231231010, Purchase20231231011) so these do not leave any outstanding liability.\n\n2. We then identify the “Purchase” transactions that remain unpaid:\n • “Purchase20231231009” has amount = 800,000.0, is marked “Unpaid”, and its payment method is “Account Payable.”\n • “Purchase20231231012” has amount = 1,300,000.0, is marked “Unpaid” with payment method “Account Payable.”\n\n3. The outstanding (final) Accounts Payable balance is simply the sum of those amounts:\n  800,000.0 + 1,300,000.0 = 2,100,000.0\n\nThus, the Increase (or ending balance) in Accounts Payable is 2,100,000.00.\n\nThe final answer in the requested JSON format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"2100000.00\"}}",
