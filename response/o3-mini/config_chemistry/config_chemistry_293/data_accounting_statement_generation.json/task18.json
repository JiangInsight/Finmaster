                        "content": "We can show the “owners equity” on the balance‑sheet as the sum of the “initial” injections plus the “net profit” (or loss) generated during the period. In our example the very first three rows (the “Initial…” rows) add up to\n\n  3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 13,000,000.00\n\nThis is the initial owners equity value.\n\nThen – “net profit” is obtained by “adding in” all income‐items (the “Sale” transactions (whose “profit” column is the profit – that is, the sale’s after‐tax minus cost amount) as well as the “Interest Receivables” transactions) and “subtracting” from that the various expenses (the “Expense” transactions plus the “Depreciation” transaction). (Transactions such as purchases or transfers do not change owners equity because they exchange one asset for another.) \n\nWhen we add up (approximately) the profit made on all the sales (using the “profit” numbers from each Sale‑row) we obtain a total of about 1,469,640. Then, adding the interest income from the several “Interest Receivables” rows (which total about 5,024) then the “operating” income is about\n\n  1,469,640 + 5,024 ≈ 1,474,664.\n\nOn the other hand, if we sum – over all Expense rows – the costs from Administrative, Sales and Financial expenses, as well as the one Depreciation expense, the total “expense” number comes out to be roughly 2,554,548. (Each expense entry is taken “as‐recorded” on its date.) \n\nThus, the net income (or rather the net loss) is\n\n  1,474,664 – 2,554,548 = –1,079,884\n\nand the ending owners equity is then\n\n  13,000,000 + (–1,079,884) ≈ 11,920,116.\n\nFor presentation we round to two–decimals.\n\nThe final answer is therefore:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"11920115.68\"\n  }\n}\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nNote that the “step‑by‑step” calculation involves summing only those transactions that affect profit (sales profit and interest revenues) and deducting all operating expenses (including depreciation and various administrative, sales and financial expenses). Transactions such as purchases or inter‐bank transfers simply change the form of an asset and do not affect the owners equity directly.",
