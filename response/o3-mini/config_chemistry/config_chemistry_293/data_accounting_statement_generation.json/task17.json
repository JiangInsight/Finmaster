                        "content": "We can “back‐out” retained earnings during the period by “starting” with no accumulated profit (retained earnings = 0 at opening) and then “adding” the net result for the period. In our simple system the (net) profit is already “pre‐calculated from sales” (the “profit” field on each Sale transaction) while expenses, depreciation, “financial expenses” and those other “Expense” entries (all the non–capital and non–transfer transactions) reduce earnings; on the other hand, other “income” items (here the “Interest Receivables” rows) add a bit to profit. (Other transactions such as initial deposits, purchases, fixed asset entries, or transfers are balance‐sheet items and do not affect profit.)\n\nBelow is one way to “simulate” the calculation:\n\n1. Sum all sale-related “profit” amounts (the Sale–type transactions):\n  • For example, the sales rows we found have profits of about \n   1,498.27; 11,935.53; 13,580.28; 14,374.65; 16,770.88; 7,806.75; 16,898.14; 159,298.95; 5,930.91; 70,550.84; 17,132.14; 34,717.66; 144,182.50; 3,652.08; 4,428.82; 5,216.28; 120,407.25; 14,504.76; 9,166.45; 31,037.80; 15,890.52; 52,207.52; 5,553.24; 9,687.40; 17,441.68; 14,724.52; 52,114.20; 13,470.62; 111,855.06; 65,712.00; 7,800.68; 22,693.50; 28,615.27; 34,146.46; 97,428.88; 9,663.30; 35,563.82; 75,061.65; 10,440.80; 11,846.60; 56,035.50; 10,289.32; 7,306.10.\n  When all these are added the “sales profit” sum comes to about 1,469,639.58.\n\n2. Sum the “Interest Receivables” (which are income even though they are “unpaid” in many cases):\n  There are 30 such rows (with amounts such as 420.08; 375.58; 346.68; 291.08; 235.22; then several near 200, then many at about 135.54) whose total is about 5,722.78.\n\n3. Sum all expense‐side transactions – that is, every row with type “Expense” (be it Administrative, Sales or Financial) as well as the “Depreciation” row. (Purchase, Fixed Asset, and Transfer transactions affect the balance sheet only, not net income.) When you add together the many “Expense” rows you obtain roughly a grand total of 1,737,097.15.\n\n4. Then the net result for the period is\n  net income = (Sales profit + Interest income) – Expenses \n    ≈ (1,469,639.58 + 5,722.78) – 1,737,097.15 \n    ≈ 1,475,362.36 – 1,737,097.15 \n    ≈ –261,734.79\n\nSince the beginning (opening) retained earnings is assumed to be zero, the end–of–period retained earnings equals the net income. (In our sample system no prior “profit” had been accumulated.)\n\nThus we have:\n  Retained Earnings Initial Value = 0.00 \n  Retained Earnings End Value = –261,734.79\n\nThe answer in the requested JSON format is then:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"-261734.79\"} }",
