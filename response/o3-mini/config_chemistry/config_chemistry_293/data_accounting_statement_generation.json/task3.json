                        "content": "We must first decide which transactions affect the “inventory”–only those that buy or sell a trade item (in our case, products P001 (Chemical Product A), P002 (Chemical Product B), P003 (Chemical Product C) and P004 (Chemical Product D)).\n\nStep 1. Identify the beginning (on 2023‑12‑31) “purchase” transactions (the “Initial” date for inventory) that add inventory:\n\n• Purchase20231231001 – Product P001 purchased 28 units at 10,000 each:\n  28 × 10,000 = 280,000\n\n• Purchase20231231002 – Product P002 purchased 25 units at 20,000 each:\n  25 × 20,000 = 500,000\n\n• Purchase20231231003 – Product P003 purchased 6 units at 50,000 each:\n  6 × 50,000 = 300,000\n\n• Purchase20231231004 – Product P004 purchased 29 units at 100,000 each:\n  29 × 100,000 = 2,900,000\n\n• Purchase20231231005 – Product P003 purchased 21 units at 50,000 each:\n  21 × 50,000 = 1,050,000\n\n• Purchase20231231006 – Product P002 purchased 11 units at 20,000 each:\n  11 × 20,000 = 220,000\n\n• Purchase20231231007 – Product P001 purchased 10 units at 10,000 each:\n  10 × 10,000 = 100,000\n\n• Purchase20231231008 – Product P004 purchased 18 units at 100,000 each:\n  18 × 100,000 = 1,800,000\n\n• Purchase20231231009 – Product P003 purchased 16 units at 50,000 each:\n  16 × 50,000 = 800,000\n\n• Purchase20231231010 – Product P002 purchased 16 units at 20,000 each:\n  16 × 20,000 = 320,000\n\n• Purchase20231231011 – Product P001 purchased 26 units at 10,000 each:\n  26 × 10,000 = 260,000\n\n• Purchase20231231012 – Product P004 purchased 13 units at 100,000 each:\n  13 × 100,000 = 1,300,000\n\nNow, sum by product:\n\n• For P001:\n Units = 28 + 10 + 26 = 64 – Total cost = 280,000 + 100,000 + 260,000 = 640,000\n\n• For P002:\n Units = 25 + 11 + 16 = 52 – Total cost = 500,000 + 220,000 + 320,000 = 1,040,000\n\n• For P003:\n Units = 6 + 21 + 16 = 43 – Total cost = 300,000 + 1,050,000 + 800,000 = 2,150,000\n\n• For P004:\n Units = 29 + 18 + 13 = 60 – Total cost = 2,900,000 + 1,800,000 + 1,300,000 = 6,000,000\n\nThus the “Inventory Initial Value” (just after the purchase on December 31) is the sum of the costs:\n 640,000 + 1,040,000 + 2,150,000 + 6,000,000 = 9,830,000\n\nStep 2. Next we need to “remove” from inventory every sale that occurs (beginning in January 2024). (Sales subtract inventory.)\n\nLet’s tally the quantities sold by product (only for items that show a product_id):\n\nFor P001 (Chemical Product A) the sales are:\n • Sale20240102002: 1.0\n • Sale20240102003: 3.0\n • Sale20240104005: 5.0 \n • Sale20240110015: 3.0\n • Sale20240112021: 2.0\n • Sale20240113024: 2.0\n • Sale20240116031: 5.0\n • Sale20240118038: 4.0\n • Sale20240126059: 3.0\n • Sale20240127063: 5.0\n • Sale20240128065: 5.0\n • Sale20240130069: 5.0\n  Total sold for P001 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 43 units\n\nFor P002 (Chemical Product B):\n • Sale20240103004: 4.0\n • Sale20240105007: 4.0\n • Sale20240106009: 3.0\n • Sale20240113023: 2.0\n • Sale20240115029: 2.0\n • Sale20240117034: 3.0\n • Sale20240118039: 4.0\n • Sale20240120043: 2.0\n • Sale20240121048: 2.0\n • Sale20240124053: 3.0\n • Sale20240130068: 2.0\n  Total sold for P002 = 4+4+3+2+2+3+4+2+2+3+2 = 31 units\n\nFor P003 (Chemical Product C):\n • Sale20240106010: 2.0\n • Sale20240111017: 1.0\n • Sale20240111018: 2.0\n • Sale20240116032: 4.0\n • Sale20240117035: 4.0\n • Sale20240119041: 2.0\n • Sale20240125055: 2.0\n • Sale20240126060: 2.0\n • Sale20240129067: 3.0\n  Total sold for P003 = 2+1+2+4+4+2+2+2+3 = 20 units\n\nFor P004 (Chemical Product D):\n • Sale20240107011: 5.0\n • Sale20240108013: 2.0\n • Sale20240110016: 4.0\n • Sale20240112020: 5.0\n • Sale20240114027: 5.0\n • Sale20240121047: 5.0\n • Sale20240122050: 3.0\n • Sale20240124054: 1.0\n • Sale20240125056: 4.0\n • Sale20240127062: 5.0\n  Total sold for P004 = 5+2+4+5+5+5+3+1+4+5 = 39 units\n\nStep 3. Now compute the remaining quantity for each product:\n – P001: 64 initially – 43 sold = 21 remaining\n – P002: 52 – 31 = 21 remaining\n – P003: 43 – 20 = 23 remaining\n – P004: 60 – 39 = 21 remaining\n\nStep 4. The purchase costs are uniform for each product so the “inventory end value” (the inventory still on hand) is:\n For P001: 21 × 10,000 = 210,000\n For P002: 21 × 20,000 = 420,000\n For P003: 23 × 50,000 = 1,150,000\n For P004: 21 × 100,000 = 2,100,000\nTotal inventory end value = 210,000 + 420,000 + 1,150,000 + 2,100,000 = 3,880,000\n\nThus the answer is:\n Inventory Initial Value = 9,830,000.00\n Inventory End Value = 3,880,000.00\n\nAccording to the required json output format, our answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"9830000.00\",\n    \"Inventory End Value\": \"3880000.00\"\n  }\n}",
