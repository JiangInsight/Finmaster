                        "content": "We can “derive” a closing inventory cost by (a) adding up the cost of each purchase (which “adds” inventory), then (b) subtracting the cost‐of‐goods sold (the “inventory” leaving the business via sales). (In a cash flow statement the change in inventory is reported with a “negative” sign when inventory goes up because that uses cash, and vice‐versa.)\n\nIn our case we have four “inventory” products; we start with no inventory (the “Initial” rows do not carry a product balance), and then “Purchases” and “Sales” cause the inventory balance to change.\n\nStep 1. Sum all purchases for each product:\n\n• Product A (P001):\n – Purchase20231231001: 28 units × 10,000 = 280,000.00 \n – Purchase20231231007: 10 units × 10,000 = 100,000.00 \n – Purchase20231231011: 26 units × 10,000 = 260,000.00 \n  Total purchased (P001): 28 + 10 + 26 = 64 units and cost = 280,000 + 100,000 + 260,000 = 640,000.00\n\n• Product B (P002):\n – Purchase20231231002: 25 units × 20,000 = 500,000.00 \n – Purchase20231231006: 11 units × 20,000 = 220,000.00 \n – Purchase20231231010: 16 units × 20,000 = 320,000.00 \n  Total purchased (P002): 25 + 11 + 16 = 52 units and cost = 500,000 + 220,000 + 320,000 = 1,040,000.00\n\n• Product C (P003):\n – Purchase20231231003: 6 units × 50,000 = 300,000.00 \n – Purchase20231231009: 16 units × 50,000 = 800,000.00 \n  Total purchased (P003): 6 + 16 = 22 units and cost = 300,000 + 800,000 = 1,100,000.00\n\n• Product D (P004):\n – Purchase20231231004: 29 units × 100,000 = 2,900,000.00 \n – Purchase20231231008: 18 units × 100,000 = 1,800,000.00 \n – Purchase20231231012: 13 units × 100,000 = 1,300,000.00 \n  Total purchased (P004): 29 + 18 + 13 = 60 units and cost = 2,900,000 + 1,800,000 + 1,300,000 = 6,000,000.00\n\nNow, the total purchase cost (for ending inventory purposes) is:\n 640,000.00 + 1,040,000.00 + 1,100,000.00 + 6,000,000.00 = 8,780,000.00\n\nStep 2. Sum up the “cost_amount” from sales transactions (each sale “removes” inventory at its cost – here provided explicitly):\n\nLooking through the sales entries we have (with the cost amounts shown):\n\n• For P001, the sales cost amounts add up to:\n  10,000.00 + 30,000.00 + 50,000.00 + 30,000.00 + 20,000.00 + 20,000.00 + 50,000.00 + 40,000.00 + 40,000.00 + 30,000.00 + 50,000.00 + 50,000.00 + 50,000.00 = 470,000.00\n\n• For P002, the sales cost amounts add up to:\n  80,000.00 + 80,000.00 + 60,000.00 + 60,000.00 + 80,000.00 + 40,000.00 + 40,000.00 + 60,000.00 + 40,000.00 = 540,000.00\n\n• For P003, the sales cost amounts add up to:\n  100,000.00 + 50,000.00 + 100,000.00 + 200,000.00 + 200,000.00 + 200,000.00 + 100,000.00 + 100,000.00 + 150,000.00 = 1,200,000.00\n\n• For P004, the sales cost amounts add up to:\n  500,000.00 + 400,000.00 + 500,000.00 + 500,000.00 + 300,000.00 + 100,000.00 + 400,000.00 + 500,000.00 = 3,200,000.00\n\nThus, the total cost “sold” is:\n 470,000.00 + 540,000.00 + 1,200,000.00 + 3,200,000.00 = 5,410,000.00\n\nStep 3. Compute ending inventory (by cost) as:\n Total Purchases – Cost of Goods Sold = 8,780,000.00 – 5,410,000.00 = 3,370,000.00\n\nIn a cash flow statement “increase (decrease) in inventory” is shown with a “minus” sign if inventory increases (because more cash is tied up in inventory). Since our ending inventory is 3,370,000.00 (and assuming the opening balance was zero), inventory increased by that amount. Therefore we report a “decrease in cash” equal to –3,370,000.00.\n\nThus the final solution is:\n\n{\n  \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-3370000.00\"\n}\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested json format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-3370000.00\"} }\n```",
