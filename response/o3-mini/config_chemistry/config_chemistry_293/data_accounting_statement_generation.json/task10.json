In our data the only three transactions that change the non‐current asset account are:\n\n1. The initial “Fixed Assets” record (from the “Initial20231231001” row) shows an opening value of 5,000,000.00.  \n2. A new fixed asset purchase appears in the “FixedAsset20231231001” row with an amount of 324,677.57; this amount is added to the non‐current assets.  \n3. A depreciation entry (row “Depreciation20240101001”) of 45,753.36 is recorded. Depreciation reduces the net book value of the assets.\n\nThus the ending non–current asset value is computed as follows:\n\n  Opening Amount = 5,000,000.00  \n  Add: Purchases = 324,677.57  \n  Subtotal = 5,000,000.00 + 324,677.57 = 5,324,677.57  \n  Less: Depreciation = 45,753.36  \n  Ending Value = 5,324,677.57 – 45,753.36 = 5,278,924.21\n\nPresenting our answer in the requested format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"5278924.21\"\n  }\n}",
