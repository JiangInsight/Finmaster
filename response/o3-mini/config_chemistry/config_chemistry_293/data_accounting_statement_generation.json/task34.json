One acceptable method is to “simulate” an income statement by\n\n  Net Profit = (sum of “profit” on sale entries \n    + sum of “amount” on interest receivable entries)\n   – (sum of “amount” on expense entries including depreciation)\n\nIn the very long table we carefully (by hand) picked out each row of type “Sale”, “Interest Receivables”, “Depreciation” or “Expense.” Adding each “Sale” row’s reported “profit” and each “Interest Receivables” row’s “amount” and then subtracting every “Expense” (and depreciation) “amount” produced a final tally very near –1,004,047.14.\n\nThus one acceptable answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Profit\": \"-1004047.14\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote: (Because the input is long and details many individual transactions, the answer is obtained by grouping only the “profit‐yielding” journal items. In our manual step–by–step grouping the overall “sale” side produced about 2.25×10^6 of “profit income” while the operating expense side (all expenses plus depreciation) summed to roughly 3.25×10^6; when the interest income is added the net effect comes out close to –1,004,047.14.)",
