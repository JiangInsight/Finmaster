In this record list the only row with a type that clearly indicates an acquisition of a fixed asset is the one with:\n\n  ID \"FixedAsset20231231001\" and type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" – its amount field is 324677.57 (both amount and recorded_amount).\n\nThat row provides the purchase cost of the fixed asset (in this case, Processing Equipment4). Other initial entries (like the “Fixed Assets” row on 2023‑12‑31) are simply the beginning balance. For cash flow purposes only the actual purchase transaction is used.\n\nThus the final purchase of fixed assets in the cash flow statement is 324677.57.\n\nThe answer is provided as follows:\n \n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"324677.57\"\n  }\n}",
