                        "content": "We must “follow the money” for items in the bank‐deposit account. In our record the “Initial20231231001” entry keeps the starting bank deposit. In the new problem the row\n\n  Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | … | amount = 5000000.0\n\ngives an initial bank deposit of 5,000,000.00.\n\nThen we must “adjust” that balance by noticing which transactions actually change (i.e. “draw on” or “add to”) the bank deposit.\n\nOne common way to affect the bank deposit is by payments made with a “Bank Transfer” (that is, money is withdrawn from the bank account when paying for a purchase using a bank transfer) while on the receipt side if a customer pays by bank transfer – the deposit would increase. In our table none of the sales come in by bank transfer – almost all are “Cash” or “Account Receivable” – so no direct increase is recorded.\n\nLet’s list the purchase (or similar) rows whose payment_method is “Bank Transfer” (meaning money is paid out of the bank):\n\n1. Purchase20231231001 – amount 280,000.00; payment_method = Bank Transfer.\n2. Purchase20231231002 – amount 500,000.00; payment_method = Bank Transfer.\n3. Purchase20231231007 – amount 100,000.00; payment_method = Bank Transfer.\n4. Purchase20231231009 – amount 130,000.00; payment_method = Bank Transfer.\n5. Purchase20231231010 – amount 320,000.00; payment_method = Bank Transfer.\n\nTheir total is:\n  280,000 + 500,000 = 780,000  \n  780,000 + 100,000 = 880,000  \n  880,000 + 130,000 = 1,010,000  \n  1,010,000 + 320,000 = 1,330,000\n\nOther transactions of “Transfer” type move money between the “Bank” and “Cash” accounts. (When you “transfer” money from the bank to cash [a “Bank to cash transfer”] the bank balance falls while a “Cash to bank transfer” increases it.) In our data there are several such transfers; if you add up the “Bank to cash transfers” on one hand and the “Cash to bank transfers” on the other hand the net effect cancels out (in our problem the total outflow by bank‐to‐cash transfers equals the total inflow from cash‐to‐bank transfers). (For example, there are several “Transfer20240104001”, “Transfer20240105001”, “Transfer20240106001” and “Transfer20240115001” that decrease the bank deposit – and later several “Transfer20240127001”, “Transfer20240128001”, “Transfer20240129001” and “Transfer20240130001” with “Cash to bank transfer” that add back the same total.) So they make no net change on our Bank Deposits balance.\n\nNo sale increases the bank deposit directly (none is received by bank transfer) so the only net change is the “withdrawal” via the paid purchases that used bank transfer.\n\nThus the end‐of–period bank deposit equals\n\n  Initial bank deposit – (sum of payments out via bank transfer)\n    = 5,000,000.00 – 1,330,000.00\n    = 3,670,000.00\n\nHence we present our answer as follows.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"3670000.00\"\n  }\n}",
