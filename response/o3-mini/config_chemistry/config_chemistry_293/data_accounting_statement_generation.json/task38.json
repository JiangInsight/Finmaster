In the table below only those sales whose “receive_method” is “Account Receviable” (and the “payment/receipt_status” is “Unpaid”) add to AR. (Any receipts that would reduce AR are not separately provided here.) One may “simulate” the net change in AR as follows:\n\n1.

Therefore the “(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable” is reported as a negative number equal to –1,879,185.22.\n\nThus the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-1879185.22\"\n  }\n}",
