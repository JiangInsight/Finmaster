                        "content": "We can “re‐construct” the tax‐payable item by “accumulating” the VAT that the business has charged on its sales (that is, the tax amounts shown on each sale transaction) and then “reducing” the amount by any recoverable VAT on its purchases. In our case the (assumed) tax rate is 5% so that each sale’s tax amount is simply the difference between its “amount” and “after tax amount” (and these already appear on the sales rows) while for each purchase the “tax credit” is taken as 5% of its amount (since the purchase “amount” is recorded net of tax, the tax is “imputed” as 5% of that amount).\n\nStep 1. (Sum of tax collected on sales)\n\nGoing down the “Sale” rows (only the rows whose type is “Sale” contain a tax‐amount) we add up their “tax_amount” values. (For example, one sale row might have amount =11498.27, after_tax_amount = 10923.36 so its tax_amount is 11498.27–10923.36 = 574.91 – and similar for the other sale rows.) When you add all the sale tax_amount’s from our table you obtain a total of\n\n  Tax collected on sales = 391,297.55\n\nStep 2. (Tax “credit” on purchases)\n\nFor every “Purchase” row the business “recovers” part of the VAT. (Here we assume the tax rate is 5%; that is, the recoverable tax is 5% of the purchase’s amount.) For example, one purchase may be for an amount of 280,000.0 so its tax credit is 0.05×280,000 = 14,000. Do the same for every purchase row and then sum them – the purchases in this problem (look for rows whose type is “Purchase” or “Fixed Assets Purchase”) add up to a total tax credit of\n\n  Tax credit on purchases = 491,500.00\n\nStep 3. (Determine the “final” tax payable)\n\nThe “tax payable” (that is, the liability heading on the balance – and also the “final” tax payable shown in the cash‐flow statement) is computed as follows:\n  Final tax payable = (Tax collected on sales) – (Tax credit on purchases)\n\nIn our case that is\n\n  391,297.55 – 491,500.00 = –100,202.45\n\nA negative “tax payable” means that, overall, the business has generated a tax “receivable” rather than a liability (or in other words, the tax credit exceeds the tax collected on sales). When presenting the “Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable” item on the cash‐flow statement it is common to show a “decrease” when the ending balance is lower than the beginning balance – here, our computed change is –100,202.45 (that is, a decrease of 100,202.45).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"-100202.45\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis is our final result.",
