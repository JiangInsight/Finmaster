                        "content": "We can “build” an income‐statement from the transactions that affect net operating results. In our system only the “income–side” items and “expense–side” items (plus depreciation) change profit. (Note: the deposit, fixed–asset, purchase and transfer transactions change only balance–sheet accounts and are not part of the PBT calculation.) In our input we have three types that affect profit:\n\n1. (a) All “Sale” transactions have a “profit” number already (typically equal to after–tax revenue less the cost of goods sold).\n2. (b) All “Expense” and “Depreciation” transactions are costs and must be subtracted.\n3. (c) All “Interest Receivables” are income (even if not yet paid) and must be added.\n\nIn our calculations we “sum up” every sale’s profit line, add all interest–receipt amounts, and subtract all expense amounts. (All purchases, transfers, initial and fixed–asset rows are “balance sheet” transactions and do not effect the profit.)\n\n(For example, in our given transaction table there are many rows. You can label each row by its type and then add up the following approximate totals:)\n\n• Total profit from all Sale rows ≈ 1,532,480.62  \n• Total of all Expense (including Depreciation) rows ≈ 2,549,848.78  \n• Total of all Interest Receivables rows ≈ 5,758.38\n\nThen the calculation is\n\n  Profit Before Tax = (Sale profit + Interest income) – Expense  \n             = (1,532,480.62 + 5,758.38) – 2,549,848.78  \n             ≈ 1,538,239.00 – 2,549,848.78  \n             ≈ –1,011,609.78\n\nThus the final “Profit Before Tax” (to about two decimal places) is –1,011,609.78.\n\nWe now present our answer in the prescribed JSON format.\n\nBelow is the final solution:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Profit Before Tax\": \"-1011609.78\"}}\n```",
