                        "content": "Let's calculate each of the three ratios step by step.\n\n1. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n   Formula: Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity  \n   For this problem, Total Liabilities is given as Total Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55 and Total Owner’s Equity is 11,598,563.11.  \n   Calculation: 2,491,297.55 / 11,598,563.11 ≈ 0.2147  \n   Rounded to two decimal places, the ratio is approximately 0.21.\n\n2. Net Profit Margin  \n   Formula: Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100  \n   Here, Net Profit is –1,401,436.89 and Total Revenue is 7,825,951.24.  \n   Calculation: (–1,401,436.89 / 7,825,951.24) × 100 ≈ –17.91%  \n   So, the Net Profit Margin is approximately –17.91%.\n\n3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n   Formula: Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities  \n   The Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is –4,398,760.38, and Total Current Liabilities is 2,491,297.55.  \n   Calculation: –4,398,760.38 / 2,491,297.55 ≈ –1.764  \n   Rounded to two decimal places, the ratio is about –1.76.\n\nNow, placing our answers into the JSON required format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.21\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"-17.91%\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.76\"\n  }\n}",
