Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio:\n • From the balance sheet, Total Assets (End_amount) = 14,089,860.66.\n • Also from the balance sheet, Total Owner’s Equity (End_amount) = 11,598,563.11.\n • Therefore, Total Liabilities = Total Assets − Total Owner’s Equity = 14,089,860.66 − 11,598,563.11 = 2,491,297.55.\n • The Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets = 2,491,297.55 / 14,089,860.66 ≈ 0.1767, which rounds to 0.18.\n\nStep 2. Calculate the Gross Profit Margin:\n • From the income statement, Gross Profit = 1,535,951.24.\n • Total Revenue = 7,825,951.24.\n • Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100 = (1,535,951.24 / 7,825,951.24) × 100 ≈ 19.63%.\n\nStep 3. Calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\n • From the cash flow statement, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –4,398,760.38.\n • And from the balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55.\n • Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities = –4,398,760.38 / 2,491,297.55 ≈ –1.7648, which rounds to –1.76.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.18\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"19.63%\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.76\"\n  }\n}",
