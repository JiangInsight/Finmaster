                        "content": "We’ll compute each ratio step‐by‐step.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio \n • Formula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities  \n • From the cash flow statement: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –4,398,760.38  \n • From the balance sheet: Total Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55  \n • Ratio = –4,398,760.38 / 2,491,297.55 ≈ –1.76\n\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \n • For this task (as in the sample) we use the same denominator (current liabilities).  \n • Ratio = –4,398,760.38 / 2,491,297.55 ≈ –1.76\n\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio  \n • Formula: Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  \n • Cost of Goods Sold (income statement) = 6,290,000.00  \n • Inventory on 2024-01-30 = 3,540,000.00 and beginning inventory = 0.  \n • Average Inventory = (0 + 3,540,000.00) / 2 = 1,770,000.00  \n • Ratio = 6,290,000.00 / 1,770,000.00 ≈ 3.55\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n • Formula: Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity  \n • Here total liabilities (from the balance sheet) = 2,491,297.55  \n • Total Owner’s Equity = 11,598,563.11  \n • Ratio = 2,491,297.55 / 11,598,563.11 ≈ 0.21\n\n5. Quick Ratio  \n • Formula: (Current Assets – Inventory) / Current Liabilities  \n • Current Assets (end) = 8,810,936.45  \n • Inventory = 3,540,000.00  \n • Numerator = 8,810,936.45 – 3,540,000.00 = 5,270,936.45  \n • Ratio = 5,270,936.45 / 2,491,297.55 ≈ 2.12\n\n6. Current Ratio  \n • Formula: Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \n • Ratio = 8,810,936.45 / 2,491,297.55 ≈ 3.54\n\nBelow is the formatted answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.76\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-1.76\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"3.55\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.21\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"2.12\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"3.54\"\n  }\n}",
