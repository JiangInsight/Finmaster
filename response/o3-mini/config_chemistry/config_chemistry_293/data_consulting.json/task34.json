                        "content": "We begin by extracting the relevant end‐of‐period numbers from the three statements. For clarity we use the following figures (all numbers are given in monetary units):\n\n1. From the Balance Sheet (End_date 2024‑01‑30):  \n • Total Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55  \n • Total Current Assets = 8,810,936.45  \n • Inventory = 3,540,000.00  \n • Total Assets = 14,089,860.66  \n • Total Owner’s Equity = 11,598,563.11  \n • (Since there are no non‐current liabilities reported, Total Liabilities = Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity − Total Owner’s Equity = 14,089,860.66 – 11,598,563.11 = 2,491,297.55)\n\n2. From the Cash Flow Statement (2024‑01‑30):  \n • Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –4,398,760.38\n\n3. From the Income Statement (2024‑01‑30):  \n • Main Business Revenue = 7,825,951.24  \n • Cost of Goods Sold = 6,290,000.00  \n • Net Profit = –1,401,436.89\n\n4. From the Balance Sheet – Accounts Receivable:  \n • Beginning Accounts Receivable = 0.00 (at 2023‑12‑31)  \n • Ending Accounts Receivable = 1,988,616.02  \n => Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 1,988,616.02) / 2 = 994,308.01\n\nNow we calculate each ratio step by step:\n\nA. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n  = [Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities] / [Total Current Liabilities]  \n  = (–4,398,760.38) / 2,491,297.55  \n  ≈ –1.76  \n\nB. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n  = [Total Liabilities] / [Total Owner’s Equity]  \n  = 2,491,297.55 / 11,598,563.11  \n  ≈ 0.21  \n\nC. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n  = [Total Revenue] / [Total Assets]  \n  Using Total Revenue = Main Business Revenue = 7,825,951.24, we have:  \n  = 7,825,951.24 / 14,089,860.66  \n  ≈ 0.56  \n\nD. Quick Ratio  \n  = (Total Current Assets – Inventory) / Total Current Liabilities  \n  = (8,810,936.45 – 3,540,000.00) / 2,491,297.55  \n  = 5,270,936.45 / 2,491,297.55  \n  ≈ 2.12  \n\nE. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n  Since this ratio in our context is the same as “Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio”, we have:  \n  ≈ –1.76  \n\nF. Return on Equity (ROE)  \n  = (Net Profit / Total Owner’s Equity) × 100%  \n  = (–1,401,436.89 / 11,598,563.11) × 100%  \n  ≈ –12.07%  \n\nG. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n  Commonly computed as Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n  = 7,825,951.24 / 994,308.01  \n  ≈ 7.87  \n\nThus, the final answers are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.76\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.21\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.56\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"2.12\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.76\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"-12.07%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"7.87\"\n  }\n}",
