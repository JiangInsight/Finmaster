Debt to Asset Ratio\n\nThe balance sheet “Total Current Liabilities” is 2,491,297.55 and “Total Assets” is 14,089,860.66. (No extra “noncurrent liabilities” are given so the current liabilities represent the debt.)\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets  \n  = 2,491,297.55 / 14,089,860.66  \n  ≈ 0.1768  \nRounded to two decimal places, this is ≈ 0.18.\n\nStep 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nFrom the cash flow statement, the “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities” is –4,398,760.38, and from the income statement the “Net Profit” is –1,401,436.89.\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Net Profit)  \nSince both Net Cash Flow and Net Profit are negative, their ratio is positive.  \n  = (–4,398,760.38) / (–1,401,436.89)  \n  ≈ 3.137  \nRounded to two decimal places, this is ≈ 3.14.\n\nBelow is the final answer in the required json format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.18\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"3.14\"\n  }\n}",
