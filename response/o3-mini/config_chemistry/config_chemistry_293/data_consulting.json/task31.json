Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n• Definition: (Main Business Revenue) / (Accounts Receivable)  \n• Here, Main Business Revenue = 7,825,951.24  \n  Accounts Receivable (End Amount) = 1,988,616.02  \n• Calculation: 7,825,951.24 / 1,988,616.02 ≈ 3.93  \n\nStep 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n• Both ratios use Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities divided by Total Current Liabilities.  \n• Here, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –4,398,760.38  \n  Total Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55  \n• Calculation: –4,398,760.38 / 2,491,297.55 ≈ –1.77  \n• (Thus, both the “operating cash flow ratio” and the “operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio” equal –1.77.)  \n\nStep 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n• Definition: (Total Revenue) / (Total Assets)  \n• Here, Total Revenue = 7,825,951.24  \n  Total Assets (End Amount) = 14,089,860.66  \n• Calculation: 7,825,951.24 / 14,089,860.66 ≈ 0.56  \n\nStep 4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n• Definition: (Total Liabilities) / (Owner’s Equity)  \n• Here, Total Liabilities can be derived as:  \n  Total Liabilities = Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity – Total Owner’s Equity  \n  = 14,089,860.66 – 11,598,563.11  \n  = 2,491,297.55  \n  Owner’s Equity = 11,598,563.11  \n• Calculation: 2,491,297.55 / 11,598,563.11 ≈ 0.21  \n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.93\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-1.77\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.77\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.56\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.21\"\n  }\n}",
