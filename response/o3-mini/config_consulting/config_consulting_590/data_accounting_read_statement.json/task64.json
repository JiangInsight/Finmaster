In the balance sheet the “Paid-in Capital” end value is 13000000.00.\n\n2. In the income statement the “Profit Before Tax” value is 1337664.61.\n\n3. In the cash flow statement the “Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable” amount is 462000.00.\n\nFollowing the specified order: first item from the balance sheet, then income statement, and finally from the cash flow statement, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value1\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"value2\": \"1337664.61\",\n    \"value3\": \"462000.00\"\n  }\n}",
