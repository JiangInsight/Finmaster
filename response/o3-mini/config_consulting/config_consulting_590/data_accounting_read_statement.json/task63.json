In the new balance sheet, “Taxes Payable” has an End_amount of 169880.98.\n\nStep 2: From the Income Statement, we extract the “Main Business Revenue” end value. In the new income statement, “Main Business Revenue” is 3397619.40.\n\nStep 3: From the Cash Flow Statement, we extract the “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities” end value, which is –1368775.90.\n\nThus, the three values are:\n• Balance Sheet (Taxes Payable): 169880.98  \n• Income Statement (Main Business Revenue): 3397619.40  \n• Cash Flow Statement (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities): –1368775.90  \n\nThe final JSON solution is as follows:\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value1\": \"169880.98\",\n    \"value2\": \"3397619.40\",\n    \"value3\": \"-1368775.90\"\n  }\n}",
