                        "content": "We first extract and calculate the necessary figures from the three statements.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n • We use the ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) ÷ (Total Current Liabilities).\n • From the cash flow statement: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –1,368,775.90.\n • From the balance sheet: Total Current Liabilities = 631,880.98.\n • Calculation: –1,368,775.90 ÷ 631,880.98 ≈ –2.17.\n\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n • We follow the same idea here (using total liabilities which in this case equals current liabilities).\n • Calculation: –1,368,775.90 ÷ 631,880.98 ≈ –2.17.\n\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n • Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold ÷ Average Inventory.\n • Since the beginning inventory is 0, the average inventory = (0 + Ending Inventory) / 2.\n • From the income statement, Cost of Goods Sold = 1,337,000.00.\n • From the balance sheet, Ending Inventory = 343,000.00.\n • Average Inventory = 343,000 ÷ 2 = 171,500.\n • Calculation: 1,337,000.00 ÷ 171,500 ≈ 7.80.\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n • Use the ratio = Total Liabilities ÷ Total Owner’s Equity.\n • Total Liabilities = 631,880.98.\n • Total Owner’s Equity = 14,167,783.63.\n • Calculation: 631,880.98 ÷ 14,167,783.63 ≈ 0.04.\n\n5. Quick Ratio\n • Quick Ratio = (Current Assets – Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities.\n • From the balance sheet: Current Assets = 9,891,156.92 and Inventory = 343,000.00.\n • Calculation: (9,891,156.92 – 343,000.00) ÷ 631,880.98 = 9,548,156.92 ÷ 631,880.98 ≈ 15.12.\n\n6. Current Ratio\n • Current Ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities.\n • Calculation: 9,891,156.92 ÷ 631,880.98 ≈ 15.65.\n\nThus, the calculated ratios are:\n\n{\n  \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-2.17\",\n  \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-2.17\",\n  \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"7.80\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.04\",\n  \"Quick Ratio\": \"15.12\",\n  \"Current Ratio\": \"15.65\"\n}",
