                        "content": "We first calculate the three ratios as follows:\n\n1. ROE (Return on Equity):  \n • Use the average owner’s equity. Here, the beginning owner’s equity is the Paid‑in Capital (13,000,000.00) and the ending owner’s equity is given as 14,167,783.63.  \n • Average Owner’s Equity = (13,000,000.00 + 14,167,783.63) / 2 = 13,583,891.815  \n • Net Profit (from the income statement) = 1,167,783.63  \n • ROE = (1,167,783.63 ÷ 13,583,891.815) × 100 ≈ 8.60%\n\n2. Debt to Asset Ratio:  \n • This is calculated as Total Liabilities / Total Assets.  \n • From the balance sheet, Total Liabilities (here, only Current Liabilities appear) = 631,880.98  \n • Total Assets = 14,799,664.61  \n • Debt to Asset Ratio = 631,880.98 ÷ 14,799,664.61 ≈ 0.0427, which rounds to 0.04\n\n3. Gross Profit Margin:  \n • This is calculated as Gross Profit / Total Revenue × 100  \n • From the income statement, Gross Profit = 2,060,619.40 and Total Revenue = 3,397,619.40  \n • Gross Profit Margin = (2,060,619.40 ÷ 3,397,619.40) × 100 ≈ 60.61%\n\nThus, the final solution is:\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"8.60%\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.04\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"60.61%\"\n  }\n}",
