                        "content": "We start by extracting the key figures from the provided statements.\n\n1. Free Cash Flow (FCF) is defined as:  \n  FCF = Cash Flow from Operating Activities – Capital Expenditures  \nFrom the cash flow statement, we have:  \n  • Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –1,368,775.90  \n  • Purchase of Fixed Assets (capex) = 0.00  \nThus, FCF = –1,368,775.90 – 0.00 = –1,368,775.90\n\n2. Return on Assets (ROA) is calculated as:  \n  ROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) × 100  \nFrom the income statement, Net Profit = 1,167,783.63  \nFrom the balance sheet, Total Assets at period end = 14,799,664.61  \nSo, ROA = (1,167,783.63 / 14,799,664.61) × 100 ≈ 7.89%\n\n3. Return on Equity (ROE) is calculated as:  \n  ROE = (Net Profit / Total Owner’s Equity) × 100  \nFrom the balance sheet, Total Owner’s Equity at end = 14,167,783.63  \nThus, ROE = (1,167,783.63 / 14,167,783.63) × 100 ≈ 8.25%\n\n4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is computed as:  \n  Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit  \nThus, Ratio = –1,368,775.90 / 1,167,783.63 ≈ –1.17  \n(Note: A negative ratio indicates that while the reported net profit is positive, the operating cash flow is negative.)\n\n5. Net Profit Margin is given by:  \n  Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100  \nFrom the income statement, Total Revenue = 3,397,619.40  \nThus, Net Profit Margin = (1,167,783.63 / 3,397,619.40) × 100 ≈ 34.40%\n\n6. Gross Profit Margin is calculated as:  \n  Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100  \nFrom the income statement, Gross Profit = 2,060,619.40  \nThus, Gross Profit Margin = (2,060,619.40 / 3,397,619.40) × 100 ≈ 60.61%\n\nThus, the JSON solution is as follows:\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-1368775.90', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '7.89%', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '8.25%', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-1.17', 'Net Profit Margin': '34.40%', 'Gross Profit Margin': '60.61%'}}",
