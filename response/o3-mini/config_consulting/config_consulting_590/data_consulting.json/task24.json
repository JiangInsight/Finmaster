Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio.\n • Total liabilities can be obtained from the balance sheet by subtracting Owner’s Equity from Total Assets.\n  – Total Assets = 14,799,664.61 \n  – Total Owner’s Equity = 14,167,783.63 \n  – Therefore, Total Liabilities = 14,799,664.61 – 14,167,783.63 = 631,880.98\n • Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets = 631,880.98 / 14,799,664.61 ≈ 0.04273 (which we can round to 0.04)\n\nStep 2. Calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio.\n • From the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –1,368,775.90\n • From the income statement, Net Profit = 1,167,783.63\n • Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Net Profit = –1,368,775.90 / 1,167,783.63 ≈ –1.17274 (which we can round to –1.17)\n\nThus, the solution in the requested JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.04\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-1.17\"\n  }\n}",
