In this case, that is given as Accounts Payable of 462,000.00 plus Taxes Payable of 169,880.98, making a total of 631,880.98.\n\nStep 2: Compute the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio.  \nThe Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Debt).  \n\nThus,  \n  Ratio = –1,368,775.90 / 631,880.98 ≈ –2.17  \n\nStep 3: Present the result in the required JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-2.17\"\n  }\n}",
