                        "content": "Let's break down each ratio calculation step by step:\n\n1. Debt to Asset Ratio:\n • From the balance sheet (end amounts at 2024-02-05), Total Assets = 14,799,664.61.  \n • Total Liabilities are given indirectly (Total Liabilities = Total Assets – Total Owner’s Equity).  \n  – Total Owner's Equity = 14,167,783.63  \n  – Therefore, Total Liabilities = 14,799,664.61 – 14,167,783.63 = 631,880.98  \n • Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets = 631,880.98 / 14,799,664.61 ≈ 0.0427  \n  Rounded to two decimals, this is \"0.04\".\n\n2. Gross Profit Margin:\n • From the income statement, Gross Profit = 2,060,619.40 and Total Revenue = 3,397,619.40.  \n • Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Total Revenue = 2,060,619.40 / 3,397,619.40 ≈ 0.6063  \n  Expressed as a percentage, this is about \"60.63%\".\n\n3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\n • From the cash flow statement, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –1,368,775.90.  \n • From the balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities = 631,880.98.  \n • Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities = –1,368,775.90 / 631,880.98 ≈ –2.168  \n  Rounded to two decimals, this is \"-2.17\".\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.04\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"60.63%\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-2.17\"\n  }\n}",
