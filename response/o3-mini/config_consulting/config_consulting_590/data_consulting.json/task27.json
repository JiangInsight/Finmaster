                        "content": "We first extract the necessary values from the three statements.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio  \n  • From the cash flow statement, the “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities” is –1,368,775.90.  \n  • From the income statement, “Net Profit” is 1,167,783.63.  \n  • The ratio is calculated as:  \n    Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Net Profit)  \n      = –1,368,775.90 / 1,167,783.63 ≈ –1.17  \n\n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio  \n  • “Total Revenue” from the income statement is 3,397,619.40.  \n  • Total current assets are given on the balance sheet at the beginning (8,000,000.00) and at the ending date (9,891,156.92).  \n  • Compute average current assets:  \n    Average = (8,000,000.00 + 9,891,156.92) / 2  \n      = 17,891,156.92 / 2  \n      ≈ 8,945,578.46  \n  • The turnover ratio is:  \n    Ratio = (Total Revenue) / (Average Current Assets)  \n      = 3,397,619.40 / 8,945,578.46 ≈ 0.38  \n\n3. Quick Ratio  \n  • Quick assets generally are defined as: Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable. Using the ending amounts:  \n    Cash on Hand = 2,339,224.10  \n    Bank Deposits = 4,292,000.00  \n    Interest Receivable = 14,796.43  \n    Accounts Receivable = 2,902,136.39  \n    Sum of Quick Assets = 2,339,224.10 + 4,292,000.00 + 14,796.43 + 2,902,136.39  \n      = 9,548,156.92  \n  • Total Current Liabilities is 631,880.98.  \n  • Quick Ratio = (Quick Assets) / (Total Current Liabilities)  \n    = 9,548,156.92 / 631,880.98 ≈ 15.12  \n\nThus, our final solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-1.17\",\n    \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.38\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"15.12\"\n  }\n}",
