In the balance sheet:\n\n• At the beginning (2023-12-31) the owner’s equity was 13,000,000.00 (Paid-in Capital plus Retained Earnings of 0.00).  \n• At the end (2024-02-05) the owner’s equity is given as 14,167,783.63.\n\nThus, the average owner's equity is:  \n  (13,000,000.00 + 14,167,783.63) / 2  \n  = 27,167,783.63 / 2  \n  ≈ 13,583,891.82\n\nNext, from the income statement we have the Net Profit, which is 1,167,783.63.\n\nNow, the Return on Equity (ROE) is calculated by dividing the Net Profit by the average owner’s equity:\n  ROE = Net Profit / Average Owner's Equity  \n  = 1,167,783.63 / 13,583,891.82  \n  ≈ 0.08588, or about 8.59%\n\nFinally, the answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '8.59%'} }",
