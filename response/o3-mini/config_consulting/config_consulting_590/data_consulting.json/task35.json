                        "content": "We start by extracting the required numbers from the provided three statements.\n\n1. Current Ratio  \n   Definition: Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities  \n   • Total Current Assets = 9,891,156.92  \n   • Total Current Liabilities = 631,880.98  \n   Calculation: 9,891,156.92 ÷ 631,880.98 ≈ 15.65\n\n2. Gross Profit Margin  \n   Definition: (Gross Profit ÷ Total Revenue) × 100%  \n   • Gross Profit = 2,060,619.40  \n   • Total Revenue = 3,397,619.40  \n   Calculation: 2,060,619.40 ÷ 3,397,619.40 ≈ 0.6063 = 60.63%\n\n3. Debt to Asset Ratio  \n   Definition: Total Liabilities ÷ Total Assets  \n   • Total Liabilities (only current liabilities are provided) = 631,880.98  \n   • Total Assets = 14,799,664.61  \n   Calculation: 631,880.98 ÷ 14,799,664.61 ≈ 0.0427, which rounds to 0.04\n\n4. Net Profit Margin  \n   Definition: (Net Profit ÷ Total Revenue) × 100%  \n   • Net Profit = 1,167,783.63  \n   • Total Revenue = 3,397,619.40  \n   Calculation: 1,167,783.63 ÷ 3,397,619.40 ≈ 0.3437 = 34.37%\n\n5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio  \n   Definition: Cash and Cash Equivalents ÷ Current Liabilities  \n   • Cash on Hand = 2,339,224.10  \n   • Bank Deposits = 4,292,000.00  \n   • Cash and Cash Equivalents = 2,339,224.10 + 4,292,000.00 = 6,631,224.10  \n   • Current Liabilities = 631,880.98  \n   Calculation: 6,631,224.10 ÷ 631,880.98 ≈ 10.50\n\n6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)  \n   Definition: FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities – Capital Expenditures  \n   • Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –1,368,775.90  \n   • Purchase of Fixed Assets = –0.00  \n   Calculation: –1,368,775.90 – 0 = –1,368,775.90\n\n7. Return on Assets (ROA)  \n   Definition: (Net Profit ÷ Total Assets) × 100%  \n   • Net Profit = 1,167,783.63  \n   • Total Assets = 14,799,664.61  \n   Calculation: 1,167,783.63 ÷ 14,799,664.61 ≈ 0.0789 = 7.90%\n\nThe final answer in the requested JSON format is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"15.65\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"60.63%\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.04\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"34.37%\",\n    \"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"10.50\",\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-1368775.90\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"7.90%\"\n  }\n}",
