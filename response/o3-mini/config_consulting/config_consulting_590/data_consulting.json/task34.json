                        "content": "We begin by extracting the relevant numbers from the three statements. (All amounts used are the End_amounts unless noted otherwise.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio \n  = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Current Liabilities)\n\nFrom cash flow statement:\n• Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –1,368,775.90\nFrom balance sheet:\n• Total Current Liabilities = 631,880.98\n\nThus:\n  Ratio = –1,368,775.90 / 631,880.98 ≈ –2.17\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Debt to Equity Ratio \n  = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity\n\nIn this case the only liabilities given are the current liabilities.\nFrom balance sheet:\n• Total Liabilities = 631,880.98 \n• Total Owner’s Equity = 14,167,783.63\n\nThus:\n  Ratio = 631,880.98 / 14,167,783.63 ≈ 0.04\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio \n  = Sales / Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n• Total Revenue (Sales) = 3,397,619.40\nFrom the balance sheet:\n• Total Assets = 14,799,664.61\n\nThus:\n  Ratio = 3,397,619.40 / 14,799,664.61 ≈ 0.23\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Quick Ratio \n  = (Quick Assets) / (Total Current Liabilities)\nQuick Assets are calculated as the sum of Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable and Accounts Receivable.\n\nFrom balance sheet:\n• Cash on Hand = 2,339,224.10\n• Bank Deposits = 4,292,000.00\n• Interest Receivable = 14,796.43\n• Accounts Receivable = 2,902,136.39\n\nQuick Assets = 2,339,224.10 + 4,292,000.00 + 14,796.43 + 2,902,136.39 \n                  = 9,548,156.92\n\nDivide by Total Current Liabilities = 631,880.98\n\nThus:\n  Quick Ratio ≈ 9,548,156.92 / 631,880.98 ≈ 15.12\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio \n  Since the sample provided shows the Operating Cash Flow Ratio equal to the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio, we use the same computed value:\n  ≈ –2.17\n\n──────────────────────────────\n6. Return on Equity (ROE) \n  = (Net Profit) / (Total Owner’s Equity)\n\nFrom the income statement:\n• Net Profit = 1,167,783.63\nFrom the balance sheet:\n• Total Owner’s Equity = 14,167,783.63\n\nThus:\n  ROE = 1,167,783.63 / 14,167,783.63 ≈ 0.0824 or 8.24%\n\n──────────────────────────────\n7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio \nUsually, the ratio is computed as:\n  = Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\nHere, since the beginning Accounts Receivable was 0 (as provided in the statement) and the ending is given, the average is (0 + Ending)/2.\nThus, \n  Average Accounts Receivable = 2902136.39 / 2 ≈ 1,451,068.20\n\nThen:\n  Turnover Ratio = 3,397,619.40 / 1,451,068.20 ≈ 2.34\n\nAn equivalent method is to compute 2 × Sales / Ending AR, which yields the same result.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-2.17\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.04\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.23\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"15.12\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-2.17\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"8.24%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.34\"\n  }\n}",
