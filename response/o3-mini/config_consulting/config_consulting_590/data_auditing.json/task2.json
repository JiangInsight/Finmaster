                        "content": "We examined the many rows and found two records whose “recorded_date” does not match the “invoice” text. For example, one Purchase row (id “Purchase20231231012”) was recorded with a date of “2024‐01‐30” even though its invoice says “On December 31, 2023…”, and a similar problem was spotted with one Expense row (id “Expense20240129001”) whose recorded date was “2024‐02‐14” while the invoice clearly states “On January 29, 2024…”. In both cases all other fields seem consistent so the error is solely with the date value. Our best‐estimate correction is to use the date mentioned in the invoice text.\n\nBelow is our answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": [\n    {\n      \"Original category\": null,\n      \"Recorded category\": null,\n      \"Original date\": \"2024-01-29\",\n      \"Recorded date\": \"2024-02-14\",\n      \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null,\n      \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null,\n      \"Original payment_method\": null,\n      \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n      \"Original quantity\": null,\n      \"Recorded quantity\": null,\n      \"Original price\": null,\n      \"Recorded price\": null,\n      \"Original receive_method\": null,\n      \"Recorded receive_method\": null,\n      \"Original amount\": null,\n      \"Recorded amount\": null,\n      \"Original tax\": null,\n      \"Recorded tax\": null,\n      \"Original profit\": null,\n      \"Recorded profit\": null,\n      \"Original Preparer\": null,\n      \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n      \"Original Approver\": null,\n      \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n      \"id\": \"Expense20240129001\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Original category\": null,\n      \"Recorded category\": null,\n      \"Original date\": \"2023-12-31\",\n      \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-30\",\n      \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null,\n      \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null,\n      \"Original payment_method\": null,\n      \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n      \"Original quantity\": null,\n      \"Recorded quantity\": null,\n      \"Original price\": null,\n      \"Recorded price\": null,\n      \"Original receive_method\": null,\n      \"Recorded receive_method\": null,\n      \"Original amount\": null,\n      \"Recorded amount\": null,\n      \"Original tax\": null,\n      \"Recorded tax\": null,\n      \"Original profit\": null,\n      \"Recorded profit\": null,\n      \"Original Preparer\": null,\n      \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n      \"Original Approver\": null,\n      \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n      \"id\": \"Purchase20231231012\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
