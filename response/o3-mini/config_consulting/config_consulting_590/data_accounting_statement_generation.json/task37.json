                        "content": "We need to determine the depreciation expense that is “added back” in the cash flow statement. In the example there was only one depreciation entry so the final depreciation item was that same number. In our problem file there are two depreciation transactions:\n\n• On January 1 (id “Depreciation20240101001”) the depreciation amount is 45747.38 (shown as 45747.380000000005, but practically 45747.38 rounded to 2 decimals).\n\n• On February 1 (id “Depreciation20240201002”) the depreciation amount is 45744.93.\n\nBecause depreciation expense is a non‐cash adjustment that is usually summed for the period, we add the two amounts:\n\n  45747.38 + 45744.93 = 91492.31\n\nThus the final depreciation item (i.e. the total depreciation expense to be added back) is 91492.31.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested json format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Depreciation\": \"91492.31\"} }\n```",
