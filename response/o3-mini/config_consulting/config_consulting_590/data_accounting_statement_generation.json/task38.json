                        "content": "We must “build” the ending accounts receivable balance from the sales that were made on credit – that is, those sales whose “receive_method” is recorded as “Account Receviable” (note: the spelling is as‐given). (In a cash‐flow statement the “use” of cash from an increase in accounts receivable is presented as a negative number.)\n\nTo explain briefly, we scan the sales transactions and add together the “after_tax_amount” for each sale whose receive method is “Account Receviable.” (Sales in which the product was sold using “Cash” are not counted as an increase in receivables.) Then the “(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable” is the (ending AR – beginning AR); if AR increases then the cash flow adjustment is a “use” of cash (shown as a negative number).\n\nBelow is a list of the credit (“Account Receviable”) sales and their after‐tax amounts (all numbers come directly from the data):\n\n1.

In the cash flow statement an increase in accounts receivable is shown as a use of cash (a negative adjustment), so we report it as –2,757,029.56.\n\nThus the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-2757029.56\"\n  }\n}",
