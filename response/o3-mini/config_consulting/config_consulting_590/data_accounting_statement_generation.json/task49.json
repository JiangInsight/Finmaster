The “Net Profit” was derived by summing all the profit amounts from every Sale transaction.\n2. “Depreciation” is the total of the two Depreciation entries.\n3. The working‐capital adjustments were computed by summing those Sales whose receive method was “Account Receviable” (a net increase of 2,755,089.91 – which is subtracted), summing the “Interest Receivable” entries (–14,796.43), and adding the increases from outstanding purchases recorded as “Unpaid” (which form an estimated increase in Accounts Payable of 462,000.00). Inventory purchases during the period increased inventory by 1,679,000.00 (hence a –1,679,000.00 adjustment) and tax amounts taken from the sales add up to a credit of 169,880.98.\n4. Summing Net Profit, Depreciation and all working‐capital changes gives the “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities” of –1,664,893.65.\n5. No additional investing transactions (apart from the initial fixed assets already on‐balance) occurred during the period so the investing section is zero.\n6. With a beginning cash balance of 8,000,000.00 the ending cash position (after net operating cash used) is 6,335,106.35 and the net change is –1,664,893.65.\n\nNote that these numbers have been derived step–by–step from the provided transaction data. Adjustments in real practice may depend on further detail; here we have followed a direct–method aggregation as described.",
