                        "content": "We “simulate” an income‐statement calculation by including only those transactions that “hit” the profit and loss. In our case we take:\n \n• All “Sale” entries (their “profit” field given) as revenues.\n• All expense entries – including the “Administrative Expenses”, “Sales Expenses”, “Financial Expenses” and non‐cash “Depreciation” – are “costs” that get subtracted.\n• In addition, “Interest Receivables” (even if marked “Unpaid”) show interest income so we add those.\n \nIn our “problem to solve” table the (rough) step–by–step aggregation is as follows (numbers are taken from the “amount” or “profit” fields in each row by type):\n\n1. Sum all sale “profit” fields (from the rows with id starting with “Sale…”):  \n  184230.98 + 174894.93 + 187021.71 + 80661.23 + 1041.74 + 185922.71 + 925.47 + 195859.81 + 1212.39 + 177286.94 + 93204.06 + 8759.13 + 1384.14 + 1203.63 + 141259.43 + 164938.80 + 116405.22 + 172245.21 + 1313.08 + 141168.27 + 1255.80 + 6896.81 + 21527.91  \n  ≈ 2,060,619.40\n\n2. Sum all “Interest Receivables” amounts (which are income) – these appear on many rows (for example, several rows give about 418.03–to–418.3, some a bit lower toward 382 or 381.99; when all such rows are added the total comes out approximately to ≈ 14,796.43).\n\n3. Sum all “Expense” amounts (note that “Depreciation” is included in expense too) – adding every row from all the Expense types (Administrative, Sales, Financial) plus the depreciation row gives a total expense of approximately ≈ 692,006.29.\n\nThen the “Profit Before Tax” is computed as:\n\n  (Sale profit total + Interest income total) – (Total expenses)\n  ≈ (2,060,619.40 + 14,796.43) – 692,006.29 \n  ≈ 2,075,415.83 – 692,006.29 \n  ≈ 1,383,409.54\n\nThus the final profit before tax is about 1,383,409.54.\n\nBelow is our answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Profit Before Tax\": \"1383409.54\"}}",
