                        "content": "We need to “build” the liabilities account – that is, to determine which of the many transactions in the period that are recorded on the liability side. In our books the “Initial” transactions (the cash, bank deposits and fixed assets) have no liability component so the “Liabilities initial value” is zero. Then when purchases are made your books may record “Purchase” transactions that are marked   “Unpaid” (often with a payment method “Account Payable”) – and these unpaid amounts (liability balances) are “owed” money that will show as liabilities on the balance sheet.\n\nIn the new dataset the only purchases that “create” liabilities are those with type “Purchase” whose payment/receipt status is “Unpaid” (or where the payment method is “Account Payable”). Scanning through the data the following purchase transactions fall into this category:\n\n1. Purchase20231231006 – amount = 5,000.0, status “Unpaid”\n2. Purchase20231231008 – amount = 2,000.0, status “Unpaid”\n3. Purchase20231231009 – amount = 200,000.0, status “Unpaid”\n4. Purchase20231231010 – amount = 200,000.0, status “Unpaid”\n5. Purchase20231231013 – amount = 5,000.0, status “Unpaid”\n6. Purchase20231231014 – amount = 10,000.0, status “Unpaid”\n7. Purchase20231231016 – amount = 40,000.0, status “Unpaid”\n\nNo other transaction (even if it is an expense, or a sale that gives accounts receivable, or an “Initial” deposit) is counted into liabilities.\n\nBy summing up these amounts we get:\n\n  5,000.0 + 2,000.0 = 7,000.0  \n  7,000.0 + 200,000.0 = 207,000.0  \n  207,000.0 + 200,000.0 = 407,000.0  \n  407,000.0 + 5,000.0 = 412,000.0  \n  412,000.0 + 10,000.0 = 422,000.0  \n  422,000.0 + 40,000.0 = 462,000.0  \n\nThus the total “liability side” from outstanding (unpaid) purchase invoices is 462,000.00.\n\nSince there is no beginning liability (the initial transactions did not create any liability) we have:\n\n  Total Liabilities Initial Value = 0.00  \n  Total Liabilities End Value = 462000.00\n\nBelow is our final answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"462000.00\"} }\n```",
