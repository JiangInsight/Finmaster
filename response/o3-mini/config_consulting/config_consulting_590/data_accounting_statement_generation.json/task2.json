                        "content": "We must “build” the balance‐sheet “bank deposits” item by starting with the bank deposit amount already on “Initial20231231001 – Bank deposit” and then “adjusting” for only those transactions that affect bank funds. In our “problem” table the only transactions that directly hit the bank deposit are those where the payment method is “Bank Transfer” (or where a paid transaction is made “by bank”); other transactions that use “Cash” (or are “Unpaid” so not “paid out” yet) do not immediately alter the bank deposit balance.\n\nStep 1. Look at the “Initial20231231001 – Bank deposit” row. Its amount is 5,000,000.00. This is our starting Bank Deposits Initial Value.\n\nStep 2. Identify all transactions in the table that are “Purchase” (or similar types) made by “Bank Transfer.” (Ignore those paid by Cash or that are Unpaid because in this bookkeeping framework only a “Bank Transfer” payment is assumed to affect the bank deposit.)\n\nIn our table the following purchases (by their id) are paid by Bank Transfer and therefore “reduce” the bank‐deposit:\n\n • Purchase20231231001 – Purchase; payment_method = Bank Transfer; amount = 300,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231002 – Purchase; payment_method = Bank Transfer; amount = 2,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231004 – Purchase; payment_method = Bank Transfer; amount = 1,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231007 – Purchase; payment_method = Bank Transfer; amount = 3,000.00  \n\nThen – note that the table shows more than one record with id “Purchase20231231011”. In this data there are two separate Purchase20231231011 lines (one from Supplier 6 and one from Supplier 5), both paid by Bank Transfer:\n\n • First Purchase20231231011 – amount = 200,000.00  \n • Second Purchase20231231011 – amount = 200,000.00  \n\nNext one is:\n\n • Purchase20231231012 – Purchase; payment_method = Bank Transfer; amount = 200,000.00  \n\nAnd finally:\n\n • Purchase20231231015 – Purchase; payment_method = Bank Transfer; amount = 2,000.00  \n\nAll the rest of the “Purchase” rows are either paid by Cash or remain “Unpaid” – so they do not come into our bank‐deposit “book.”\n\nStep 3. Sum the “bank outflow” amounts that reduce the bank deposit:\n\n 300,000.00  \n+ 2,000.00  \n+ 1,000.00  \n+ 3,000.00  = 306,000.00  \n+ 200,000.00  = 506,000.00  \n+ 200,000.00  = 706,000.00  \n+ 200,000.00  = 906,000.00  \n+ 2,000.00  = 908,000.00\n\nStep 4. The final Bank Deposits End Value is then computed by subtracting these bank‐based outflows from the initial deposit:\n\n 5,000,000.00 – 908,000.00 = 4,092,000.00\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"4092000.00\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis is the step‐by‐step computation based solely on adjusting the starting bank deposit by the transactions paid from the bank via “Bank Transfer.”",
