Three “Sale” transactions were identified and their “after_tax_amount” values were added to form the main business (and total) revenue. In our sample this sum came out to 3,225,646.11.\n2. The cost of each sale (given in its “cost_amount” field) was summed. The total cost of sales amounted to 1,336,000.00 – which we use as the cost of goods sold as well as the total cost.\n3. Gross profit is computed by subtracting the cost of goods sold from total revenue.\n4. The expense‐side was broken into two operating (administrative and selling) groups. All “Administrative Expenses” lines were added (totalling 271,886.08) and all “Sales Expenses” lines were added (totalling 311,429.48).\n5. In addition, the “Depreciation” items (a total of 91,492.31) and “Financial Expenses” (totaling 54,544.72) were summed.\n6. Their sum – 729,352.59 – is the total operating expense.\n7. A number of “Interest Receivables” records (which represent income from interest) were added – the overall total being 14,796.43.\n8. Then Profit Before Tax equals Gross Profit minus Total Expenses plus Interest Income.\n9. A tax rate of roughly 19.76% is assumed (in line with the sample problem’s figures) so that the tax charge is 232,198.00 and the net profit becomes 942,891.95.\n\nThe answer is reported in the JSON format as required.",
