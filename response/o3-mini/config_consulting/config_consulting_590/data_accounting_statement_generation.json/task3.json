                        "content": "We must “build” an inventory “account” from only those transactions that add (via purchase‐type entries) or remove (via sale “cost” entries) inventory items. In our data the “Initial” rows just set up cash, bank and fixed assets and do not include any inventory; so we take the inventory “beginning” as zero. Then we “load” inventory by summing up every purchase that is for a product (each purchase row has a nonblank cost_per_unit and product information) and “remove” cost when an inventory item is sold (the sale row shows a “cost_amount” that is assumed to represent the cost at which the item went out of stock).\n\nLet’s explain briefly how we arrived at the answer.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Identify Purchases for Inventory\n\nBelow is a list of purchase-type transactions (their id starts with “Purchase20231231…”). For each, we compute:\n • Quantity purchased × cost_per_unit = “cost” added to inventory.\n\nFor example:\n• Purchase20231231001 (for product S004 “Enterprise Solution”): quantity = 3 and cost_per_unit = 100000 so cost = 3×100000 = 300000.\n•\nThen we do the same for all the purchase rows:\n – For S004 “Enterprise Solution” we have:\n  • Purchase20231231001:    3 units @100000 = 300000  \n  • Purchase20231231003:    3 units @100000 = 300000  \n  • Purchase20231231005:    2 units @100000 = 200000  \n  • Purchase20231231009:    2 units @100000 = 200000  \n  • Purchase20231231010:    2 units @100000 = 200000  \n  • Purchase20231231011:    2 units @100000 = 200000  \n  • Purchase20231231012:    2 units @100000 = 200000  \n   Total for S004 = 300000 + 300000 + (5×200000) = 300000+300000+1000000 = 1,600,000.\n – For S001 “Basic Consulting” we have:\n  • Purchase20231231002:    2 units @1000 = 2000  \n  • Purchase20231231004:    1 unit @1000 = 1000  \n  • Purchase20231231007:    3 units @1000 = 3000  \n  • Purchase20231231008:    2 units @1000 = 2000  \n  • Purchase20231231015:    2 units @1000 = 2000  \n   Total for S001 = 2000+1000+3000+2000+2000 = 10,000.\n – For S002 “Standard Consulting” we have:\n  • Purchase20231231006:    1 unit @5000 = 5000  \n  • Purchase20231231013:    1 unit @5000 = 5000  \n  • Purchase20231231014:    2 units @5000 = 10000  \n  • Purchase20231231017:    2 units @5000 = 10000  \n   Total for S002 = 5000+5000+10000+10000 = 30,000.\n – For S003 “Premium Consulting” we have:\n  • Purchase20231231016:    2 units @20000 = 40000.\n  Total for S003 = 40,000.\n\nIf you add these purchase “costs” together you get the gross inventory added:\n 1,600,000 + 10,000 + 30,000 + 40,000 = 1,680,000.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Identify Sales that “withdraw” inventory (i.e. cost of goods sold)\n\nEach “Sale” row that has a “cost_amount” represents the cost of the products that left inventory. (We assume that for every sale the “cost_amount” is taken from inventory.) Listing the sales along with product and amount:\n\nFor S004 (“Enterprise Solution”):\n • Sale20240102001: cost_amount = 100000  \n • Sale20240102002: cost_amount = 100000  \n • Sale20240103004: cost_amount = 100000  \n • Sale20240106006: cost_amount = 100000  \n • Sale20240108010: cost_amount = 100000  \n • Sale20240111016: cost_amount = 100000  \n • Sale20240111017: cost_amount = 100000  \n • Sale20240128037: cost_amount = 100000  \n • Sale20240128038: cost_amount = 100000  \n • Sale20240130040: cost_amount = 100000  \n • Sale20240130041: cost_amount = 100000  \n • Sale20240131044: cost_amount = 100000  \n  Total for S004 = 12 × 100000 = 1,200,000.\nFor S001 (“Basic Consulting”):\n • Sale20240107008: cost_amount = 1000  \n • Sale20240110012: cost_amount = 1000  \n • Sale20240111015: cost_amount = 1000  \n • Sale20240123031: cost_amount = 1000  \n • Sale20240130042: cost_amount = 1000  \n • Sale20240131045: cost_amount = 1000  \n  Total for S001 = 6 × 1000 = 6000.\nFor S002 (“Standard Consulting”):\n • Sale20240112018: cost_amount = 5000  \n • Sale20240204049: cost_amount = 5000  \n  Total for S002 = 10,000.\nFor S003 (“Premium Consulting”):\n • Sale20240205052: cost_amount = 20000.\n  Total for S003 = 20,000.\n\nThus, the grand total “cost” removed from inventory (i.e. cost of goods sold) is:\n 1,200,000 + 6000 + 10000 + 20000 = 1,236,000.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Compute Ending Inventory Value\n\nSince (Inventory Ending) = (Gross Inventory Purchased) – (Cost of Goods Sold) and if beginning inventory is zero then:\n Ending Inventory = 1,680,000 – 1,236,000 = 444,000.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nAlso note:\n• Inventory Initial Value is taken at the beginning of the period which here is zero (no beginning inventory on 2023‑12‑31 apart from cash, bank and fixed assets).\n• Inventory End Value, computed as above, is 444,000.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThus the answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Inventory End Value\": \"444000.00\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis is the answer to the task.",
