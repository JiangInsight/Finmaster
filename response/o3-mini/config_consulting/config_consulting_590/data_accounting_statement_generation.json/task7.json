                        "content": "We first must “seed” our books with the beginning‐of‐period “Initial” balances. In our case the opening entries include three “Initial20231231001” rows. One of those is a “Fixed Assets” row with an amount of 5,000,000.00. (The Cash and Bank deposit rows give the cash/bank side.) \n\nThen we look through the period’s transactions for any that represent an acquisition (or “purchase”) of fixed assets. In the sample problem (the “example”) a row with an identifier beginning “FixedAsset…” added 305,354.43 to fixed assets. In our current dataset none of the purchase transactions carry a type indicating they are a fixed asset purchase – they are ordinary “Purchase” transactions for goods or services, not equipment or property (and there is no row of type “Fixed Assets Purchase”). \n\nSince no additional fixed asset–related acquisition appears in the new data, the ending “Fixed Assets” balance remains the same as that already reported in “Initial20231231001” under Fixed Assets. (Depreciation is normally tracked separately as an accumulated depreciation account and does not change the carrying cost shown on the fixed assets line item.)\n\nThus the final answer is:\n\n• Fixed Assets Initial Value = 5,000,000.00 \n• Fixed Assets End Value = 5,000,000.00 \n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format. \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"5000000.00\"} }\n```",
