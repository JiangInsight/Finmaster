Look for the depreciation‐type records.\n• In the data there are two depreciation records:\n – One on 2024‑01‑01 with amount 45747.38 (the printed value is 45747.380000000005, which we treat as 45747.38) \n – One on 2024‑02‑01 with amount 45744.93\n\nStep 2. The “initial” accumulated depreciation is what existed before posting current period expense. In these kinds of problems the fixed assets “Initial” record (having cost 5,000,000.0) does not have any depreciation already posted so the starting accumulated depreciation is 0.\n\nStep 3. The final accumulated depreciation is then the sum of all depreciation transactions during the period. That is:\n 45747.38 + 45744.93 = 91492.31\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"91492.31\"\n}\n\nBelow is the answer in the required json format.",
