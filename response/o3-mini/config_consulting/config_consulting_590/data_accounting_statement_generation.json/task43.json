                        "content": "We must “simulate” the work done by “operating‐level” (rather than financing or investing) transactions. In our example the cash–flow effect is only recorded when (a) the transaction is one that belongs in operating activities (for example, sales, ordinary purchases and expenses) and (b) a “cash” payment (or receipt) is actually made (so an “unpaid” sale or interest receivable is not yet cash‐received, and noncash items such as depreciation are ignored).\n\nIn the provided data the “initial” deposits and the “Fixed Assets” and “Depreciation” rows are not operating. Also many “Sale” rows are recorded on credit (their “payment/receipt_status” is Unpaid and/or the “receive_method” is Account Receivable) so they do not generate cash at the time. Only those operating “Sale” rows marked as “Paid” (with receive_method “Cash”) are taken as cash inflows. In the same way, only “Expense” and “Purchase” rows that were paid out (with status “Paid” and payment‐method “Cash” or “Bank Transfer”) count as an operating cash outflow. (Interest receivables recorded as “Unpaid” are non–cash at this moment.)\n\nOne (simulated) step‐by‐step summary of the work is as follows:\n\n1. We skip the “Initial…” rows, the “Fixed Assets”, and “Depreciation” rows.\n\n2. Then we scan each row one by one:\n  – For each Purchase row marked “Paid” (for example the Purchase20231231001 of 300000.0, Purchase20231231003 of 300000.0, Purchase20231231002 of 2000.0, Purchase20231231004 of 1000.0, Purchase20231231005 of 200000.0, Purchase20231231007 of 3000.0, Purchase20231231011 of 200000.0, etc.) we add its amount (as a “cash‐out”).\n  – For each Expense row (whether “Administrative” or “Sales” or “Financial”) that is “Paid” in Cash we subtract its amount.\n  – For each Sale row that is “Paid” (for example one sale on 2024‑01‑08 for 285922.71, one on 2024‑01‑11 for 193204.06, one on 2024‑01‑27 for 2203.63, one on 2024‑01‑31 for 2255.80, and one on 2024‑02‑04 for 11896.81) we add that cash inflow.\n  – We ignore “Interest Receivables” (and other working items) that are “Unpaid.”\n\n3. Adding up (many small “Paid” outflows) we obtain a very large total cash outflow – roughly about 1.86 million, while the total cash we received from operating “Sale” receipts (the ones that actually were paid in cash) totals roughly 0.50 million.\n\n4. Thus the net cash flow from operating activities is the difference:\n  Net cash flow = (cash inflows) – (cash outflows)\n          ≈ 495,483.01 – 1,864,258.91 \n          = –1,368,775.90\n\nFor the purpose of this problem the final answer (rounded to two decimals) is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": { \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-1368775.90\" }\n}\n\nKeep in mind that the “step‐by‐step” work above is our (simulated) process of “rummaging through” each line, selecting only those operating cash events and summing them up.",
