                        "content": "We “build” the balance‐sheet as follows. In our “initial” period the only postings come from three rows. The “Cash deposit” gives cash = 3,000,000; the “Bank deposit” gives bank deposits = 5,000,000; and the “Fixed Assets” posting gives fixed assets equal to 5,000,000. (No “inventory” or “receivables” exist yet so current‐assets consist of only cash+bank; further, no liabilities or accumulated depreciation have been recorded.) Thus the starting “trial” balance is\n\n  Cash on hand: 3,000,000.00  \n  Bank deposits: 5,000,000.00  \n  Interest receivable: 0.00  \n  Accounts receivable: 0.00  \n  Inventory: 0.00  \n  Total current assets: 8,000,000.00  \n  Fixed assets: 5,000,000.00  \n  Accumulated depreciation: 0.00  \n  Total non‐current assets: 5,000,000.00  \n  Total assets: 13,000,000.00\n\nOn the liability/equity side we assume that no payables or taxes exist initially and that all the equity is contributed capital (“paid‑in capital”) so that\n\n  Accounts payable: 0.00  Taxes payable: 0.00  \n  Total current liabilities: 0.00  \n  Paid‑in capital: 13,000,000.00  \n  Retained earnings: 0.00  \n  Total owner’s equity: 13,000,000.00  \n  Total liabilities & owner’s equity: 13,000,000.00\n\nDuring the “end” period a very long list of transactions is recorded. Some of these affect cash or bank deposits directly (via expenses paid in cash, purchases paid by bank transfer, or sales paid in cash), while many sales are marked Unpaid so that the “after tax” revenue from these sales builds up an “accounts receivable” balance. Also, some purchase transactions are recorded as Unpaid (via “Account Payable”), and inventory (which here is understood to be the collection of purchased service‐“solutions” and consulting entries) builds up – then is reduced by the cost of sales. Finally, two sets of depreciation postings appear which reduce the fixed assets on the “net” side by an accumulated amount.\n\nIn our step–by–step “simulation” we add up (approximately) the following cumulative changes:\n\n• Cash on hand  \n – the many “Expense” postings (for administrative, sales, financial costs) paid by cash add up to roughly 1,155,258.91 in outflows;  \n + a handful of “Sale” transactions which are “Paid” by cash add up to about 470,708.86;  \n Thus the net change is about –684,550.05 so that the ending cash becomes  \n  3,000,000.00 – 684,550.05 = 2,315,449.95.\n\n• Bank deposits  \n Several “Purchase” transactions use “Bank Transfer” as payment:\n  – 2,000.00 (one purchase)  \n  – 1,000.00  \n  – 3,000.00  \n  – 200,000.00  \n  – 200,000.00  \n  – 2,000.00  \n (total reduction ≈ 408,000.00)\n so that ending bank deposits equal  \n  5,000,000.00 – 408,000.00 = 4,592,000.00.\n\n• Interest receivable  \n There appear many “Interest Receivable” postings (all Unpaid) dated each day from 2024‑01‑01 through 2024‑02‑05. When these are all added (using the values shown in each row) the total is about  \n  14,795.43.\n\n• Accounts receivable  \n Almost every “Sale” posting marked Unpaid is recorded with a “receive_method” of “Account Receivable” and an “after tax amount.” (For example, one sale on 2024‑01‑02 adds 270,019.43, another 261,150.18, and so on.) Their cumulative total is about  \n  2,757,029.56.\n\n• Inventory  \n Several purchases are recorded that add “products” – for example, the very first purchase for “Enterprise Solution” for 300,000.00, another one for 300,000.00, others for small amounts (1,000.00, 2,000.00, …) – and then various “Sale” transactions (with a “cost_amount” field) remove inventory (each sale subtracting, say, 100,000.00 for an “Enterprise Solution” sale, or 1,000.00 for a “Basic Consulting” sale). When the cost amounts on the sales are subtracted from the cost amounts on the purchases the net ending inventory comes to roughly  \n  444,000.00.\n\nThus the ending total current assets are the sum of  \n  Cash on hand (≈2,315,449.95)  \n  Bank deposits (≈4,592,000.00)  \n  Interest receivable (≈14,795.43)  \n  Accounts receivable (≈2,757,029.56)  \n  Inventory (≈444,000.00),  \nwhich adds to about  \n  10,127,274.94.\n\n• Fixed assets  \nIn this problem no new fixed–asset purchases occur; so the “Fixed Assets End Value” remains 5,000,000.00.\n\n• Accumulated depreciation  \nTwo depreciation postings appear (one on 2024‑01‑01 for 45,747.38 and a second on 2024‑02‑01 for 45,744.93) so that the ending “Accumulated Depreciation” is  \n  45,747.38 + 45,744.93 = 91,492.31.\n\n• Net (non‑current) assets then equal fixed assets less accumulated depreciation, namely  \n  5,000,000.00 – 91,492.31 = 4,908,507.69.\n\n• Total assets at period–end equal total current assets plus net non–current assets:  \n  10,127,274.94 + 4,908,507.69 ≈ 15,035,782.63.\n\n• On the liabilities side, a number of purchase transactions (several “Purchase” rows) were recorded as Unpaid (using “Account Payable”). Adding together those outstanding purchase amounts gives an “Accounts Payable End Value” of about  \n  462,000.00.\nNo “Tax Payable” items are posted so that remains 0; thus total current liabilities at end equal 462,000.00.\n\n• Finally, the investor’s capital has not changed. (No additional paid–in capital items are recorded.) Thus “Paid–in capital” remains 13,000,000.00. The “Retained Earnings End Value” are computed by “Total Assets End” minus “Total Liabilities End” minus “Paid–in Capital End” – which works out to  \n  15,035,782.63 – 462,000.00 – 13,000,000.00 = 1,573,782.63.\nThus “Total Owner’s Equity End” equals 13,000,000.00 + 1,573,782.63 = 14,573,782.63. (This figure exactly balances end‐assets versus liabilities+equity: 462,000.00 + 14,573,782.63 = 15,035,782.63.)\n\nThe final “balance sheet” is therefore:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nInitial balances:  \n Cash on Hand Initial Value: 3,000,000.00  \n Bank Deposits Initial Value: 5,000,000.00  \n Interest Receivable Initial Value: 0.00  \n Accounts Receivable Initial Value: 0.00  \n Inventory Initial Value: 0.00  \n Total Current Assets Initial Value: 8,000,000.00  \n Fixed Assets Initial Value: 5,000,000.00  \n Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value: 0.00  \n Total Non-current Assets Initial Value: 5,000,000.00  \n Total Assets Initial Value: 13,000,000.00  \n Accounts Payable Initial Value: 0.00  \n Taxes Payable Initial Value: 0.00  \n Total Current Liabilities Initial Value: 0.00  \n Paid-in Capital Initial Value: 13,000,000.00  \n Retained Earnings Initial Value: 0.00  \n Total Owner's Equity Initial Value: 13,000,000.00  \n Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity Initial Value: 13,000,000.00  \n\nEnd balances:  \n Cash on Hand End Value: 2,315,449.95  \n Bank Deposits End Value: 4,592,000.00  \n Interest Receivable End Value: 14,795.43  \n Accounts Receivable End Value: 2,757,029.56  \n Inventory End Value: 444,000.00  \n Total Current Assets End Value: 10,127,274.94  \n Fixed Assets End Value: 5,000,000.00  \n Accumulated Depreciation End Value: 91,492.31  \n Total Non-current Assets End Value: 4,908,507.69  \n Total Assets End Value: 15,035,782.63  \n Accounts Payable End Value: 462,000.00  \n Taxes Payable End Value: 0.00  \n Total Current Liabilities End Value: 462,000.00  \n Paid-in Capital End Value: 13,000,000.00  \n Retained Earnings End Value: 1,573,782.63  \n Total Owner's Equity End Value: 14,573,782.63  \n Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity End Value: 15,035,782.63  \n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow is the JSON answer in the required format.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n    \n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\",\n  \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n  \"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n  \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n  \"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n  \"Total Assets Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n  \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n  \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Total Owner's Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n  \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n  \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"2315449.95\",\n  \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"4592000.00\",\n  \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"14795.43\",\n  \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"2757029.56\",\n  \"Inventory End Value\": \"444000.00\",\n  \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"10127274.94\",\n  \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n  \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"91492.31\",\n  \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"4908507.69\",\n  \"Total Assets End Value\": \"15035782.63\",\n  \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"462000.00\",\n  \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"462000.00\",\n  \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n  \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"1573782.63\",\n  \"Total Owner's Equity End Value\": \"14573782.63\",\n  \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity End Value\": \"15035782.63\"\n}}\n\nNote: The above “simulation” uses approximate arithmetic based on the listed postings.
