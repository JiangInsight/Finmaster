                        "content": "We can “close‐the books” by “rolling–forward” the initial owner’s equity with the net profit earned (all “sale” revenues – their cost already “embedded” as the “profit” field, plus interest income, minus all operating costs such as administrative, sales, financial expenses and depreciation). In our case the three “Initial” transactions give\n\n  Cash deposit   = 3,000,000.00  \n  Bank deposit   = 5,000,000.00  \n  Fixed assets   = 5,000,000.00  \n\nso the starting (initial) equity is\n\n  3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 13,000,000.00\n\nThen, if you “net‐up” the business’s results (the “sale” lines report a “profit” value – the excess of the sale proceeds over the cost of the product sold – and the “interest receivables” are revenue items; while all Expense and Depreciation lines reduce income) you have approximately\n\n  Total “sale profit” ≈ 2,060,619.40  \n  Total “interest receivable” ≈   14,796.43  \n  => Total “revenues” ≈ 2,075,415.83  \n  Total expense items (administrative, sales, financial, plus depreciation) ≈ 692,006.30\n\nso the net income is about\n\n  2,075,415.83 – 692,006.30 ≈ 1,383,409.53\n\nThus, the final (end‐of–period) owner’s equity is estimated as\n\n  Initial 13,000,000.00 + Net income 1,383,409.53 ≈ 14,383,409.53\n\n(Here the very many transactions have been “grouped” by type and summed so that revenue – here expressed as “profit” on sales plus interest income – totals roughly 2.075×10^6 and expenses roughly 0.692×10^6.)\n\nWe now present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"14383409.53\"}}",
