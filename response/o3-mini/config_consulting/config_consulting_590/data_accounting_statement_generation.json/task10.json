                        "content": "We start with the “Fixed Assets” portion of the opening‐balance (the “Initial” entry) and then add any “capitalized” purchases that add to the asset “pool” before reducing them by depreciation during the period.\n\nIn our data the only “initial” non‐current asset is the Fixed Assets row from 2023‑12‑31:\n\n  Initial fixed asset value = 5,000,000.00\n\nThen we look for purchase transactions that appear to “add” an item that is not a routine inventory transaction but rather a non‐current asset. In our case the “Enterprise Solution” items are purchased with a cost per unit of 100,000 and appear with product id “S004.” We assume these are capitalized, that is, they are recorded as non‐current assets. (Other “Purchase” lines with “Basic Consulting”, “Standard Consulting” or “Premium Consulting” would normally be expensed as services rather than capitalized; so we exclude them.) \n\nWe have the following purchases of “Enterprise Solution”:\n • Purchase20231231001 amount: 300,000.00 (3×100,000)\n • Purchase20231231003 amount: 300,000.00 (3×100,000)\n • Purchase20231231005 amount: 200,000.00 (2×100,000)\n • Purchase20231231009 amount: 200,000.00 (2×100,000)\n • Purchase20231231010 amount: 200,000.00 (2×100,000)\n • Purchase20231231011 amount: 200,000.00 (2×100,000)\n • Purchase20231231012 amount: 200,000.00 (2×100,000)\n \nTotal additions = 300,000 + 300,000 + 200,000 + 200,000 + 200,000 + 200,000 + 200,000 = 1,600,000.00\n\nThus the “gross” non‐current asset amount before depreciation would be\n\n  Gross Value = initial + additions = 5,000,000.00 + 1,600,000.00 = 6,600,000.00\n\nDuring the period two depreciation transactions occur:\n • Depreciation20240101001 = 45,747.38 \n • Depreciation20240201002 = 45,744.93 \n\nTotal depreciation = 45,747.38 + 45,744.93 = 91,492.31\n\nFinally the “end” (net) value for property, plant and equipment (non‐current assets) is\n\n  Ending Value = Gross Value – Total Depreciation \n         = 6,600,000.00 – 91,492.31 \n         ≈ 6,508,507.69\n\nThus we report:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"6508507.69\"\n  }\n}",
