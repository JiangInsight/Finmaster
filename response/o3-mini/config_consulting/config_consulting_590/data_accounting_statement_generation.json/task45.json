                        "content": "We need to “pull out” from the table only those cash‐flow transactions that change the firm’s long‐term (investment) balances. In a typical cash flow statement the “investing activities” are the cash used to acquire (or cash received on sale of) noncurrent assets. (Often a “fixed‐asset” purchase is separately recorded.) In the example provided the only investing activity was the purchase of a fixed asset (the “Fixed Assets Purchase” which produced a cash outflow of 305354.43).\n\nIn the current problem the only “nonoperating” (that is, “investing”) cash flows come from the purchase transactions that result in an “Enterprise Solution” – a product that (by its name and classification in our sample data) is taken to be a capital item. (The “Basic Consulting”, “Standard Consulting” and “Premium Consulting” items are small‐ticket, “operating” items; and the “Initial” entries – even the “Fixed Assets” line – are opening‐balance entries rather than actual cash flows.) \n\nLooking over the “Purchase” transactions we must include only those which (a) are for a product called “Enterprise Solution” and (b) were paid (i.e. cash actually “paid”). In our table these are:\n\n• Purchase20231231001 (type “Purchase”) has product “Enterprise Solution”, an amount of 300000.0, payment status “Paid” (by Bank Transfer).\n\n• Purchase20231231003 (type “Purchase”) has product “Enterprise Solution”, an amount of 300000.0, payment status “Paid” (by Cash).\n\n• Purchase20231231005 (type “Purchase”) has product “Enterprise Solution”, an amount of 200000.0, payment status “Paid”.\n\n• Purchase20231231009 – although it is for “Enterprise Solution” with an amount of 200000.0 – its payment/receipt status is “Unpaid” so no cash has “left” the company yet.\n\n• Purchase20231231010 – another “Enterprise Solution” purchase with an amount of 200000.0 is also “Unpaid.”\n\n• Purchase20231231011 (type “Purchase”) has product “Enterprise Solution”, an amount of 200000.0, and is “Paid.”\n\n• Purchase20231231012 (type “Purchase”) has product “Enterprise Solution”, an amount of 200000.0, “Paid.”\n\nOnly the “Paid” ones produce an actual cash outflow. (All the other “Purchase” lines – such as those whose product is “Basic Consulting,” “Standard Consulting” or “Premium Consulting” – are treated as operating expense purchases.) \n\nNow add up the amounts for the “Enterprise Solution” purchases that are paid:\n\n 300000.0 \n+ 300000.0 \n+ 200000.0 \n+ 200000.0 (from Purchase20231231011)\n+ 200000.0 (from Purchase20231231012)\n——————————————–\n = 1200000.0\n\nSince cash was paid out (an outflow) the net effect of investing activities is negative:\n\nNet Cash Flow from Investing Activities = –1200000.0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-1200000.0\"}\n}",
