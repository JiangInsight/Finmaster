                        "content": "We need to “build an inventory‐account” for the period using only the transactions that affect the “Inventory” (that is, the purchases that bring stock into the business and the sales that “use up” that stock at cost). (Because the “Inventory” change is generally computed as ending inventory – beginning inventory, and an increase in inventory “uses cash,” it is shown as a negative number in the cash flow statement.) \n\nIn our table the “Purchase” rows create inventory while the “Sale” rows remove inventory at cost. (Other entries such as Expense or Interest do not affect inventory.)\n\nBelow is one way to work it out step‐by‐step (note that product “identifiers” are used so that we must “track” each product separately):\n\n───────────────────────────── \n1. Identify products with “Purchase” transactions (and note the cost levels):\n\nA. Product S004 “Enterprise Solution”: \n • Purchase20231231001: bought 3 units at 100,000 each  → 3 units, cost 300,000 \n • Purchase20231231003: bought 3 units at 100,000 each  → 3 units, cost 300,000 \n • Purchase20231231005: bought 2 units at 100,000 each  → 2 units, cost 200,000 \n • Purchase20231231009: bought 2 units at 100,000 each  → 2 units, cost 200,000 \n • Purchase20231231010: bought 2 units at 100,000 each  → 2 units, cost 200,000 \n • Purchase20231231011: bought 2 units at 100,000 each  → 2 units, cost 200,000 \n • Purchase20231231012: bought 2 units at 100,000 each  → 2 units, cost 200,000 \n  Total purchased S004 = 3+3+2+2+2+2+2 = 16 units\n\nB. Product S001 “Basic Consulting”: \n • Purchase20231231002: bought 2 units @ 1,000 each   → 2 units, cost 2,000\n • Purchase20231231004: bought 1 unit @ 1,000 each   → 1 unit, cost 1,000 \n • Purchase20231231007: bought 3 units @ 1,000 each   → 3 units, cost 3,000 \n • Purchase20231231008: bought 2 units @ 1,000 each   → 2 units, cost 2,000 \n • Purchase20231231015: bought 2 units @ 1,000 each   → 2 units, cost 2,000 \n  Total purchased S001 = 2+1+3+2+2 = 10 units \n\nC. Product S002 “Standard Consulting”: \n • Purchase20231231013: bought 1 unit @ 5,000 each   → 1 unit, cost 5,000 \n • Purchase20231231014: bought 2 units @ 5,000 each   → 2 units, cost 10,000 \n • Purchase20231231017: bought 2 units @ 5,000 each   → 2 units, cost 10,000 \n  Total purchased S002 = 1+2+2 = 5 units \n  Total cost = 5,000 + 10,000 + 10,000 = 25,000\n\nD. Product S003 “Premium Consulting”: \n • Purchase20231231016: bought 2 units @ 20,000 each  → 2 units, cost 40,000 \n\n───────────────────────────── \n2. Now “remove” (subtract) the units sold (using the cost amounts provided on the Sale rows): \n\nA. For S004 “Enterprise Solution” the sale rows are (each sale “uses” one unit at cost 100,000):\n • Sale20240102001, Sale20240102002, Sale20240103004, Sale20240106006, Sale20240108010, Sale20240110013, Sale20240111016, Sale20240111017, Sale20240128037, Sale20240128038, Sale20240130040, Sale20240130041, Sale20240131044.\n  Total sold = 13 units.\n  Remaining S004 = 16 – 13 = 3 units → value = 3 × 100,000 = 300,000.\n\nB. For S001 “Basic Consulting” the sale rows (by product identifier S001) are:\n • Sale20240107008, Sale20240111015, Sale20240131045, Sale20240130042, Sale20240123031.\n  Total sold = 5 units.\n  Remaining S001 = 10 – 5 = 5 units → value = 5 × 1,000 = 5,000.\n\nC. For S002 “Standard Consulting”, we find:\n • Sale20240112018 sells 1 unit.\n  Remaining S002 = 5 – 1 = 4 units → value = 4 × 5,000 = 20,000.\n\nD. For S003 “Premium Consulting”:\n • Sale20240205052 sells 1 unit.\n  Remaining S003 = 2 – 1 = 1 unit → value = 1 × 20,000 = 20,000.\n\n───────────────────────────── \n3. Now add together the ending inventory values:\n • S004: 300,000 \n • S001: 5,000 \n • S002: 20,000 \n • S003: 20,000 \n Total ending inventory = 300,000 + 5,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 = 345,000\n\nSince there was no opening inventory for these items at the beginning of the period (apart from “Initial” cash, bank and fixed assets which are separate), the increase in inventory is 345,000. In the cash flow statement an increase in inventory is shown as a use of cash (a “decrease” in cash), so it is recorded with a minus sign.\n\nThus the final “(Increase) Decrease in Inventory” item comes out to –345,000.00.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nThe answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-345000.00\"\n  }\n}",
