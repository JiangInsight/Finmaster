                        "content": "We must “build” the current liability balance from those transaction items that cause an obligation (i.e. the liabilities that remain on the balance sheet at period–end). In our trial “period” none of the “Initial” entries create an existing payable (since the beginning‐of–period entries are deposits or fixed assets) so the beginning “current liabilities” (that is, liabilities that were presented at the start of the period) is zero.\n\nThen, from the transaction list we review every “Purchase” entry whose “payment/receipt_status” is Unpaid and whose “payment_method” is not a cash/bank transfer but rather “Account Payable” (which we use as our control to indicate that the purchase was not immediately paid). (Sales entries even if “Unpaid” represent accounts receivable, an asset item – and the “Interest Receivables” have similar (receivable) sign. Also, the various “Expense” items are settled in cash so do not leave a liability.)\n\nIf you scan the “Purchase” transactions in the given data you find (with the “Unpaid” flag and Payment Method = Account Payable):\n\n1. Purchase20231231006 – amount = 5000.0  \n2. Purchase20231231008 – amount = 2000.0  \n3. Purchase20231231009 – amount = 200000.0  \n4. Purchase20231231010 – amount = 200000.0  \n5. Purchase20231231013 – amount = 5000.0  \n6. Purchase20231231014 – amount = 10000.0  \n7. Purchase20231231016 – amount = 40000.0  \n\nNone of the other “Purchase” entries is “Unpaid.” (For example, the many “Purchase” entries that were marked as “Paid” are already settled and thus not “liabilities” at period–end.)\n\nAdding these amounts together we have:  \n5000 + 2000 = 7000  \n7000 + 200000 = 207000  \n207000 + 200000 = 407000  \n407000 + 5000 = 412000  \n412000 + 10000 = 422000  \n422000 + 40000 = 462000  \n\nThus the total “current liabilities” that arise from these outstanding purchases is 462000.00.\n\nBecause no opening liability exists (the initial entries show only assets and fixed assets), we conclude that:\n\n• Total Current Liabilities Initial Value = 0.00  \n• Total Current Liabilities End Value = 462000.00  \n\nPresenting the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"462000.00\"\n  }\n}",
