                        "content": "We can “back‐out” net income from the transactions by “adding up” all items that are “profit‐making” from sales (which in our case are reported already as the “profit” field on Sale transactions) and then “subtracting” the selling–, administrative–, and financial–expense outlays (including depreciation) while “adding” any interest income collected. (Purchases, asset “Initial” or “Fixed Assets” entries, and cash transfers do not affect the net profit calculation.) \n\nIn our example the “sale” rows create positive “profit” numbers. (Other revenue items such as “Interest Receivables” are meant to add income; in our data these appear as separate transactions.) Our step‐by‐step overview was as follows:\n\n1. Sum the “profit” amounts from the Sale transactions. In our table these were:\n  184230.98 + 174894.93 + 187021.71 + 80661.23 + 1041.74 + 185922.71 + 925.47 + 195859.81 + 1212.39 + 177286.94 + 93204.06 + 8759.13 + 1384.14 + 1203.63 + 141259.43 + 164938.80 + 116405.22 + 172245.21 + 1313.08 + 141168.27 + 1255.80 + 6896.81 + 21527.91\n  which added up to about 2,060,619.40.\n\n2. Then we added the “interest‐income” coming in as Interest Receivables. (There are many transactions that—with amounts near 400 each—so that their sum comes to about 15,178.42.)\n\n3. Next, we subtracted the “Expense” entries (all types whose “type” begins with Expense – be they Administrative, Sales or Financial). In our data these expense “amount” entries added up to approximately 644,258.91.\n\n4. Also, we must subtract depreciation. In our data there are two Depreciation rows (one of about 45,747.38 plus one of about 45,744.93) giving a total of about 91,492.31.\n\nThus one may “compute” the net profit (i.e. final net income used in the cash‐flow statement) as\n\n  Net Profit = (Sales‐profit total + Interest income) − (Total Expenses + Depreciation)\n        ≈ (2,060,619.40 + 15,178.42) − (644,258.91 + 91,492.31)\n        ≈ 2,075,797.82 − 735,751.22\n        ≈ 1,340,046.60\n\nWhen rounded to two decimals we obtain 1,340,046.60.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required json output format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"1340046.60\"} }\n``` \n\nNote: (The calculation above reflects one common way of “combining” the many transactions – using the reported sale “profit” numbers plus the other income/expense items – and the figures presented here are approximate to two decimals.)",
