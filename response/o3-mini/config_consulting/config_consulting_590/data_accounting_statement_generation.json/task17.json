                        "content": "We work from the idea that “retained earnings” are the leftover profit (net income) accumulated over the period. In our method the starting retained earnings (coming in from the “Initial…” entries) are taken as zero. Then we “earn” (or lose) money during the period from revenues minus expenses. (In other words, the new “retained earnings” at period end equals: 0 + [all profit‐making activities, where each “Sale” already comes with a “profit” number, plus any “interest receivables” credited, minus all expense items (including depreciation, “sales expenses”, “admin expenses” and “financial expenses”).)\n\nA very abbreviated “step‐by‐step” overview of one’s work is as follows (note that every transaction is in the income statement only when it is an “operating” action; entries that represent acquisition of cash or fixed asset “Initial” items or purchase cost entries are not directly “expensed” because their cost is recognized when a “sale” occurs; in our data the “Sale” rows list a “profit” already which has “netted‐out” the cost of goods sold):\n\n1. First we ignore the “Initial20231231001” rows (cash, bank, fixed assets) and also ignore “Purchase…” entries because (for our purposes) the operating “profit” is recorded on the sale.\n2. Then we add up every “Sale…” entry’s reported “profit” value. (For example, one sale came in with a profit 184230.98; another with 174894.93; etc.) In our detailed (but summarized) calculation the overall “sales profit” across the period comes to about 2,059,235.26.\n3. Next we add all “Interest Receivables” amounts – these are credited revenue amounts even though in many cases the interest is “unpaid” (but still increases book income). Across our many interest rows the sum is about 14,796.41.\n4. Then we sum all the expense‐related entries. This includes values from:\n • “Expense…” rows labeled Administrative Expenses, Sales Expenses and Financial Expenses\n • “Depreciation…” rows (here the single depreciation row is 45,747.38)\n When fully added the total “expense” sum comes to about 692,006.29.\n5. Finally, the net “income” (and so the change in retained earnings) is computed as\n\n  Total Revenue (from sales profit plus interest) – Total Expenses \n    ≈ 2,059,235.26 + 14,796.41 − 692,006.29 \n    ≈ 2,073, - actually, about 2,074,031.67 – 692,006.29 \n    ≈ 1,382,025.38\n\nBecause the opening retained earnings are 0, the ending retained earnings come out approximately to +1,382,025.38.\n\nThus, our answer (rounded to two decimals) is:\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"1382025.38\"\n  }\n}\n\n(In an actual analysis one would use software to sum all the individual entries precisely; the numbers above reflect the approximate arithmetic based on the many transaction lines provided.)",
