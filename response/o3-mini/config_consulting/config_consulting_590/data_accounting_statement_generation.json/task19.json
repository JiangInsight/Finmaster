                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” the answer by – in effect – “re‐computing” the change in owners’ equity from operating transactions (namely, the aggregate increments coming from profitable sales – revenues minus the expense/deduction items that lower net income) plus the “extra” liability items from purchases that were not paid (and so become accounts payable). (Note that most “asset swap” entries such as paid purchases do not change the “equity + liability” total because they simply shift one asset into another.)\n\nStep 1. Compute the “initial” balance\n• There are three “Initial20231231001” entries:\n  – Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00 \n  – Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00 \n  – Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00 \n• Sum = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.00\n\nStep 2. Go through the “period” transactions (all dated after 2023‑12‑31) that affect net income (and so owners’ equity) or add liability balances. For example (see our detailed “working note” below):\n\nA. “Revenue‐side” items (sale transactions) include a “profit” column. In our table the sale rows (by id “Sale...” using amounts such as 184230.98; 174894.93; 187021.71; 80661.23; … etc.) when summed give approximately +2,059,235.26. (These “profit” numbers mean that each sale increased the firm’s retained earnings by that amount.)\n\nB. “Expense” items (administrative expenses, sales expenses, depreciation and financial expenses) – all of which lower net income – when added together (row by row) come to roughly –737,751.25.\n\nThus the operating “net effect on equity” is about:\n  2,059,235.26 – 737,751.25 = 1,321,484.01\n\nC. In addition, a few “Purchase” rows were not “paid” (their payment/receipt status is “Unpaid” and the payment method is “Account Payable”). (For example, the row “Purchase20231231006” added 5,000.0; “Purchase20231231008” added 2,000.0; “Purchase20231231009” 200,000.0; “Purchase20231231010” 200,000.0; another purchase added 5,000.0; then one 10,000.0 and later 40,000.0 – all together these “unpaid” purchases sum to about 462,000.00.) These items are recorded as liabilities and so add directly to the “Liabilities + Owners’ Equity” total.\n\nD. Therefore the “net change” added to the initial capital is:\n  Operating net change (1,321,484.01) + new liabilities (462,000.00)\n    = 1,321,484.01 + 462,000.00\n    ≈ 1,783,484.01\n\nE. Finally, the ending “Total Liabilities and Owners Equity” equals the initial 13,000,000.00 plus the net change of about 1,783,484.01, that is:\n  13,000,000.00 + 1,783,484.01 = 14,783,484.01\n\nThus, rounding to two decimals we can state:\n\n• Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value = 13,000,000.00 \n• Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value = 14,783,484.01\n\nThe answer is then presented in the json format requested.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"14783484.01\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote:\n– The “step‐by‐step” process requires reading all transactions, identifying which entries change net income (and so owners’ equity) versus simply representing a reclassification among assets. Only the “unpaid” purchase entries add to liabilities so that (when added to the change from operations) the final “liabilities+owners’ equity” increases from the original capital.\n– Our approximate arithmetic (using the “profit” column from sale rows and summing the “expense”–type rows) gives the numbers above.",
