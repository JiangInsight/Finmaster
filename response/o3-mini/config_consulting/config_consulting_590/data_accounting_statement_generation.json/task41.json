                        "content": "We need to “build” the balance of accounts payable from the purchase‐transactions that were not paid but instead recorded with a payment method of “Account Payable”. In our table the only transactions that affect accounts payable are the Purchase transactions that were recorded as “Unpaid” and used “Account Payable” as the method. (Any purchase that has been “Paid” is not left as a liability.)\n\nLooking over the table the following rows meet the criteria:\n\n1. Row with id Purchase20231231006  \n  • Amount = 5,000.0  \n  • Payment/receipt_status = Unpaid  \n  • Payment method = Account Payable\n\n2. Row with id Purchase20231231008  \n  • Amount = 2,000.0  \n  • Payment/receipt_status = Unpaid  \n  • Payment method = Account Payable\n\n3. Row with id Purchase20231231009  \n  • Amount = 200,000.0  \n  • Payment/receipt_status = Unpaid  \n  • Payment method = Account Payable\n\n4. Row with id Purchase20231231010  \n  • Amount = 200,000.0  \n  • Payment/receipt_status = Unpaid  \n  • Payment method = Account Payable\n\n5. Row with id Purchase20231231013  \n  • Amount = 5,000.0  \n  • Payment/receipt_status = Unpaid  \n  • Payment method = Account Payable\n\n6. Row with id Purchase20231231014  \n  • Amount = 10,000.0  \n  • Payment/receipt_status = Unpaid  \n  • Payment method = Account Payable\n\n7. Row with id Purchase20231231016  \n  • Amount = 40,000.0  \n  • Payment/receipt_status = Unpaid  \n  • Payment method = Account Payable\n\nThere are no “reverse” or offsetting entries (for example payments clearing previously recorded unpaid purchases) present in the data. In effect the net effect on accounts payable is “up” by the full sum of these unpaid purchase amounts.\n\nLet’s sum them up:\n\n• 5,000.0  \n+ 2,000.0 = 7,000.0  \n+ 200,000.0 = 207,000.0  \n+ 200,000.0 = 407,000.0  \n+ 5,000.0 = 412,000.0  \n+ 10,000.0 = 422,000.0  \n+ 40,000.0 = 462,000.0  \n\nThus, the net increase in Accounts Payable is 462,000.00.\n\nBelow is our final answer in the required JSON format.\n\n \n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"462000.00\"} }\n```",
