In our data the expense items are the rows whose “type” string starts with “Expense…” and also the single “Depreciation” transaction (which is an expense).\n\nHere is how one may do it step‐by‐step (note that the “amount” column is used):\n\n1. Skip the “Initial…” (cash, bank, fixed assets) and “Purchase…” and “Sale…” items as well as the “Interest Receivables” (they are not “expenses” on the income statement).\n\n2. Keep only rows whose type is “Expense…” (for example “Administrative Expenses”, “Sales Expenses”, “Financial Expenses”) and also include the “Depreciation” row.\n\nBelow is a brief overview of the computation (all values are in the “amount” field):\n\n• Expense20240101001 (Administrative Expenses) = 7,069.68  \n• Expense20240101001 (Administrative Expenses) = 13,381.35  \n• Depreciation20240101001 = 45,747.38  \n• Expense20240102001 (Administrative Expenses) = 18,522.55  \n• Expense20240102001 (Sales Expenses) = 13,305.95  \n• Expense20240103001 (Sales Expenses) = 11,861.78  \n• Expense20240104001 (Administrative Expenses) = 7,550.68  \n• Expense20240105001 (Financial Expenses) = 7,928.54  \n• Expense20240106001 (Sales Expenses) = 13,930.48  \n• Expense20240106001 (Administrative Expenses) = 17,921.98  \n• Expense20240107001 (Sales Expenses) = 12,925.57  \n• Expense20240108001 (Sales Expenses) = 8,666.24  \n• Expense20240108001 (Administrative Expenses) = 16,893.65  \n• Expense20240109001 (Administrative Expenses) = 9,840.40  \n• Expense20240110001 (Financial Expenses) = 9,001.74  \n• Expense20240110001 (Sales Expenses) = 14,246.91  \n• Expense20240111001 (Financial Expenses) = 7,754.91  \n• Expense20240112001 (Sales Expenses) = 16,705.92  \n• Expense20240113001 (Sales Expenses) = 19,270.58  \n• Expense20240113001 (Sales Expenses) = 3,803.96  \n• Expense20240114001 (Administrative Expenses) = 16,654.12  \n• Expense20240114001 (Administrative Expenses) = 4,461.27  \n• Expense20240115001 (Sales Expenses) = 19,701.69  \n• Expense20240115001 (Sales Expenses) = 13,134.95  \n• Expense20240116001 (Sales Expenses) = 13,669.93  \n• Expense20240117001 (Sales Expenses) = 10,766.33  \n• Expense20240117001 (Administrative Expenses) = 12,390.55  \n• Expense20240118001 (Administrative Expenses) = 17,013.85  \n• Expense20240118001 (Sales Expenses) = 5,600.05  \n• Expense20240119001 (Sales Expenses) = 8,771.29  \n• Expense20240119001 (Administrative Expenses) = 18,333.00  \n• Expense20240120001 (Sales Expenses) = 10,538.58  \n• Expense20240120001 (Sales Expenses) = 17,948.72  \n• Expense20240121001 (Administrative Expenses) = 17,959.24  \n• Expense20240121001 (Sales Expenses) = 11,989.77  \n• Expense20240122001 (Financial Expenses) = 3,133.97  \n• Expense20240123001 (Administrative Expenses) = 2,784.18  \n• Expense20240123001 (Administrative Expenses) = 13,728.52  \n• Expense20240124001 (Administrative Expenses) = 19,421.61  \n• Expense20240124001 (Sales Expenses) = 8,398.64  \n• Expense20240125001 (Sales Expenses) = 5,737.39  \n• Expense20240125001 (Administrative Expenses) = 3,082.57  \n• Expense20240126001 (Sales Expenses) = 14,261.76  \n• Expense20240126001 (Sales Expenses) = 5,081.00  \n• Expense20240127001 (Administrative Expenses) = 3,882.45  \n• Expense20240127001 (Financial Expenses) = 4,579.76  \n• Expense20240128001 (Sales Expenses) = 3,342.58  \n• Expense20240129001 (Administrative Expenses) = 6,121.99  \n• Expense20240130001 (Sales Expenses) = 6,484.02  \n• Expense20240130001 (Administrative Expenses) = 15,370.59  \n• Expense20240131001 (Sales Expenses) = 16,033.09  \n• Expense20240131001 (Sales Expenses) = 13,137.94  \n• Expense20240201001 (Financial Expenses) = 15,308.56  \n• Depreciation20240201002 = 45,744.93  \n• Expense20240202001 (Sales Expenses) = 8,191.03  \n• Expense20240202001 (Administrative Expenses) = 15,719.57  \n• Expense20240203001 (Administrative Expenses) = 13,782.27  \n• Expense20240204001 (Sales Expenses) = 3,938.06  \n• Expense20240204001 (Sales Expenses) = 8,383.91  \n• Expense20240205001 (Financial Expenses) = 6,837.24\n\nWhen we sum all the above amounts the final total comes to approximately 737,751.22.\n\nThus the final “Total Expenses” item amount is 737751.22.\n\nThe final answer in the required json format is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Expenses\": \"737751.22\"} }",
