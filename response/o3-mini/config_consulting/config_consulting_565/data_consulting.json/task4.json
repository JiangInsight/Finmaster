In this balance sheet, we have only current liabilities:\n  Accounts Payable = 302,000.00  \n  Taxes Payable = 197,821.72  \n  Total Liabilities = 302,000.00 + 197,821.72 = 499,821.72\n\n2. Total Equity is shown as Total Owner's Equity = 14,390,936.99\n\n3. Thus, the Debt-to-Equity Ratio is calculated as:  \n  Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity  \n  = 499,821.72 / 14,390,936.99  \n  ≈ 0.03474\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the ratio is approximately 0.03.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\"}\n}",
