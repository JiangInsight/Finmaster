                        "content": "We start by extracting and computing the totals from the end‐of‐period balances (unless noted otherwise):\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio \n • Operating Cash Flow = –1,182,491.05  \n • Current Liabilities (Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable) = 302,000.00 + 197,821.72 = 499,821.72  \n • Ratio = –1,182,491.05 ÷ 499,821.72 ≈ –2.37\n\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio \n • (In the example the “debt” used was the current liabilities; hence we use the same base.)  \n • Ratio = –1,182,491.05 ÷ 499,821.72 ≈ –2.37\n\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio \n • Defined as Cost of Goods Sold ÷ Average Inventory  \n • In our case, Inventory is 0 at both beginning and end so the average inventory is (0 + 0)/2 = 0.  \n • With a non-zero COGS (1,684,000.00), the ratio is mathematically undefined. In practice, if no inventory is held the inventory turnover may be considered “infinite”.  \n • We will report this as \"Infinity\".\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio \n • Total Liabilities = 499,821.72 (the only liabilities listed)  \n • Total Owner’s Equity = 14,390,936.99  \n • Ratio = 499,821.72 ÷ 14,390,936.99 ≈ 0.0347, which we round to 0.03\n\n5. Quick Ratio \n • Quick Assets include cash, bank deposits, interest receivable and accounts receivable.  \n  ○ Cash on Hand = 2,103,508.95  \n  ○ Bank Deposits = 4,714,000.00  \n  ○ Interest Receivable = 15,414.09  \n  ○ Accounts Receivable = 3,149,338.94  \n • Total Quick Assets = 2,103,508.95 + 4,714,000.00 + 15,414.09 + 3,149,338.94 = 9,982,261.98  \n • Quick Ratio = 9,982,261.98 ÷ 499,821.72 ≈ 19.96\n\n6. Current Ratio  \n • Current Assets (given) = 9,982,261.98  \n • Current Liabilities = 499,821.72  \n • Current Ratio = 9,982,261.98 ÷ 499,821.72 ≈ 19.96\n\nThus, we summarize our answers as follows:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.37', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.37', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': 'Infinity', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Quick Ratio': '19.96', 'Current Ratio': '19.96'}}",
