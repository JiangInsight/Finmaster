                        "content": "We start by extracting the necessary end‐amount values from the balance sheet and cash flow statements.\n\n1. Current Assets, at End, are:\n • Total Current Assets = 9,982,261.98  \n • Inventory = 0.00  \nThus, for the Quick Ratio the “quick assets” are the current assets less inventory = 9,982,261.98.\n\n2. Current Liabilities, at End:\n • Total Current Liabilities = 499,821.72\n\n3. Total Assets, at End: 14,890,758.71\n\n4. Owner’s Equity, at End: 14,390,936.99\n\n5. Because no additional liabilities are given, we determine:\n Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 499,821.72\n\n6. From the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is –1,182,491.05.\n\nNow calculate each ratio:\n\nA. Current Ratio = (Total Current Assets) / (Total Current Liabilities)  \n = 9,982,261.98 ÷ 499,821.72 ≈ 19.96\n\nB. Quick Ratio = (Total Current Assets – Inventory) / (Total Current Liabilities)  \n = 9,982,261.98 ÷ 499,821.72 ≈ 19.96\n\nC. Debt to Asset Ratio = (Total Debt) / (Total Assets)  \n = 499,821.72 ÷ 14,890,758.71 ≈ 0.0336, which rounds to 0.03\n\nD. Debt to Equity Ratio = (Total Debt) / (Total Owner’s Equity)  \n = 499,821.72 ÷ 14,390,936.99 ≈ 0.0347, which rounds to 0.03\n\nE. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Debt)  \n = –1,182,491.05 ÷ 499,821.72 ≈ –2.365, which rounds to –2.36\n\nPresenting our answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"19.96\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"19.96\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-2.36\"\n  }\n}",
