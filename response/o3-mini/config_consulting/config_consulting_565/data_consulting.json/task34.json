                        "content": "We start by extracting the key numbers from the three statements and then apply the standard formulas.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio (and Operating Cash Flow Ratio)  \n Formula: Operating Cash Flow ÷ Total Current Liabilities  \n • Operating Cash Flow from operating activities = –1,182,491.05  \n • Total Current Liabilities (end) = 499,821.72  \n Calculation: –1,182,491.05 ÷ 499,821.72 ≈ –2.37\n\n2. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n Formula: Total Liabilities ÷ Total Owner’s Equity  \n Note: In this case the liabilities come entirely from current liabilities.  \n • Total Liabilities = 499,821.72  \n • Total Owner’s Equity (end) = 14,390,936.99  \n Calculation: 499,821.72 ÷ 14,390,936.99 ≈ 0.03\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n Formula: Total Revenue ÷ Total Assets  \n • Total Revenue = 3,956,433.90  \n • Total Assets (end) = 14,890,758.71  \n Calculation: 3,956,433.90 ÷ 14,890,758.71 ≈ 0.27\n\n4. Quick Ratio  \n Formula: (Total Current Assets – Inventory) ÷ Total Current Liabilities  \n • Total Current Assets (end) = 9,982,261.98  \n • Inventory (end) = 0.00  \n • Total Current Liabilities = 499,821.72  \n Calculation: 9,982,261.98 ÷ 499,821.72 ≈ 19.96\n\n5. (Again) Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n This is the same as ratio (1) in this context: ≈ –2.37\n\n6. Return on Equity (ROE)  \n We use the average owner’s equity in the period.  \n • Beginning owner’s equity = 13,000,000.00  \n • Ending owner’s equity = 14,390,936.99  \n Average Equity = (13,000,000.00 + 14,390,936.99) ÷ 2 = 13,695,468.50  \n • Net Profit = 1,390,936.99  \n Calculation: 1,390,936.99 ÷ 13,695,468.50 ≈ 0.1015, or 10.15%\n\n7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n Formula: Total Revenue ÷ Average Accounts Receivable  \n • Accounts Receivable (beginning) = 0.00  \n • Accounts Receivable (end) = 3,149,338.94  \n Average Accounts Receivable = (0.00 + 3,149,338.94) ÷ 2 = 1,574,669.47  \n • Total Revenue = 3,956,433.90  \n Calculation: 3,956,433.90 ÷ 1,574,669.47 ≈ 2.51\n\nThus, the answers rounded to two decimals are:\n\n{\n  \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-2.37\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n  \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.27\",\n  \"Quick Ratio\": \"19.96\",\n  \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-2.37\",\n  \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"10.15%\",\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.51\"\n}\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-2.37\", \n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\", \n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.27\", \n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"19.96\", \n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-2.37\", \n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"10.15%\", \n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.51\"\n  }\n}",
