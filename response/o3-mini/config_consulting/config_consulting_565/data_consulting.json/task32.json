                        "content": "We need to compute the following metrics step by step:\n\n1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)  \n • In our “cash flow” table the net cash flow components are given. The FCF here is calculated as the net cash flow from operating activities plus the net cash flow from investing activities (in this example, purchase of fixed assets is zero).  \n  FCF = –1,182,491.05 + 0 = –1,182,491.05\n\n2. Return on Assets (ROA)  \n • ROA is computed as:  \n  ROA = (Net Profit) ÷ (Average Total Assets) × 100  \n • From the balance sheet, the beginning total assets are 13,000,000.00 and the ending total assets are 14,890,758.71.  \n  Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 14,890,758.71) / 2 = 13,945,379.36  \n • The income statement shows Net Profit = 1,390,936.99  \n  Thus, ROA = (1,390,936.99 ÷ 13,945,379.36) × 100 ≈ 9.97%\n\n3. Return on Equity (ROE)  \n • ROE is computed as:  \n  ROE = (Net Profit) ÷ (Average Owner's Equity) × 100  \n • From the balance sheet, beginning Owner’s Equity = Paid-in Capital = 13,000,000.00 and ending Owner’s Equity = 14,390,936.99.  \n  Average Owner’s Equity = (13,000,000.00 + 14,390,936.99) / 2 = 13,695,468.50  \n • Thus, ROE = (1,390,936.99 ÷ 13,695,468.50) × 100 ≈ 10.15%\n\n4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio  \n • This ratio measures how much operating cash flow is generated for each unit of net profit.  \n  Ratio = Operating Cash Flow ÷ Net Profit  \n • Using our numbers: Ratio = (–1,182,491.05 ÷ 1,390,936.99) ≈ –0.85  \n  (The negative sign indicates that while the reported net income is positive, the operating cash flow is negative.)\n\n5. Net Profit Margin  \n • The net profit margin is computed as:  \n  Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit ÷ Total Revenue) × 100  \n • From the income statement, Total Revenue = 3,956,433.90  \n  Thus, Net Profit Margin = (1,390,936.99 ÷ 3,956,433.90) × 100 ≈ 35.15%\n\n6. Gross Profit Margin  \n • Gross profit margin is calculated as:  \n  Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit ÷ Total Revenue) × 100  \n • In the income statement, Gross Profit = 2,272,433.90 and Total Revenue = 3,956,433.90  \n  Thus, Gross Profit Margin = (2,272,433.90 ÷ 3,956,433.90) × 100 ≈ 57.43%\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-1182491.05\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"9.97%\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"10.15%\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-0.85\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"35.15%\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"57.43%\"\n  }\n}",
