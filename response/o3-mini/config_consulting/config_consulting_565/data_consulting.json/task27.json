                        "content": "We start by extracting the relevant numbers from the three statements.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n1. OPERATING CASH FLOW TO NET INCOME RATIO\n\n• From the cash flow statement, the “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities” is given as –1,182,491.05.  \n• From the income statement, “Net Profit” is 1,390,936.99.\n\nThe ratio is calculated as:  \n  Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Net Profit)  \n     = (–1,182,491.05) / (1,390,936.99)  \n     ≈ –0.85\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n2. CURRENT ASSETS TURNOVER RATIO\n\nA common way of calculating the turnover ratio is to divide the revenue by the average current assets.  \n• The “Main Business Revenue” (which in this case is equivalent to total revenue) is: 3,956,433.90.  \n• Total Current Assets:\n  – At the beginning (from the balance sheet): 8,000,000.00  \n  – At the end: 9,982,261.98\n\nAverage Current Assets = (Beginning + Ending) / 2  \n  = (8,000,000.00 + 9,982,261.98) / 2  \n  = 17,982,261.98 / 2  \n  ≈ 8,991,130.99\n\nNow, the ratio is:  \n  Ratio = Revenue / Average Current Assets  \n     = 3,956,433.90 / 8,991,130.99  \n     ≈ 0.44\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n3. QUICK RATIO\n\nThe quick ratio is computed by taking “Quick Assets” (current assets minus inventory; here inventory is 0) and dividing by current liabilities.  \n• Quick Assets = Total Current Assets – Inventory  \n  = 9,982,261.98 – 0  \n  = 9,982,261.98  \n• Total Current Liabilities (from the balance sheet) = 499,821.72\n\nThus,  \n  Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \n     = 9,982,261.98 / 499,821.72  \n     ≈ 19.96\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nThus, our final computed ratios are:\n\n  Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: –0.85  \n  Current Assets Turnover Ratio: 0.44  \n  Quick Ratio: 19.96\n\nNow, presenting in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-0.85\",\n    \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.44\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"19.96\"\n  }\n}",
