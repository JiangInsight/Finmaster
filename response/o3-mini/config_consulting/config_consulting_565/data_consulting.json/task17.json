                        "content": "We first note that in the sample provided the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio was computed as the ratio of the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities to the Total Debt (which in these examples is the sum of current liabilities). Following the same approach for the new problem, we identify:\n\n1. From the balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities (which we treat as Total Debt) = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 302,000.00 + 197,821.72 = 499,821.72.\n\n2. From the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –1,182,491.05.\n\nNow, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is calculated as: \n\n  Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) ÷ (Total Debt)\n    = (–1,182,491.05) ÷ (499,821.72) ≈ –2.37\n\nThus, the solution is as follows:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.37'} }",
