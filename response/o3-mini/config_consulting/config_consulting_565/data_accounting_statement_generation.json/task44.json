In our current data table the only row that mentions “Fixed Assets” is the opening or “initial” entry (with type “Fixed Assets” on 2023‑12‑31 showing an amount of 5,000,000). None of the other transactions represent a purchase (or acquisition) of fixed assets during the period. (They are either operating expenses, purchases of consulting services or inventory‐type items, sales, depreciation, etc.) \n\nIn a cash flow statement you record cash paid in the period to acquire fixed assets. Since no additional fixed asset purchase has occurred during the period (the initial balance is carried from the period start and not a new cash outflow), the “final purchase of fixed assets” is zero.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"0\"\n  }\n}",
