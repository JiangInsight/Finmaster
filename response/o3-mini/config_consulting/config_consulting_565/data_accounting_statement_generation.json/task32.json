In our books only items that “flow” into the income statement are\n\n• the “proﬁt” already computed on every Sale transaction (these represent the margin on that sale)\n• all non‐sale operating “expenses” (including expenses of various kinds plus depreciation) that lower profit\n• other income (here “Interest Receivables”) that increases profit\n\n(Items such as initial “deposits” or “purchase” entries do not belong in the P&L.)\n\nThus, we “add” all the Sale “profit” amounts and add the amounts from all Interest Receivable transactions (whether “Paid” or “Unpaid”). Then we “subtract” from that sum all the “Expense” transactions – even though several lines are marked “Sales Expenses” or “Administrative Expenses” – and also subtract all the “Depreciation” amounts.\n\nA (step‐by‐step) “summary” of our work is as follows. (For brevity we do not list every intermediate line; instead, we indicate that the calculation was done “line‐by‐line” over a total of more than 150 transactions.) In our processing we obtained:\n\n Sales profit total (sum over all “Sale” rows)\n  ≈ 2,271,433.90\n\n Interest Receivables total\n  ≈ 15,414.09\n\n Expenses (all “Expense” rows, whether Sales, Administrative or Financial)\n  ≈ 607,586.01\n\n Depreciation (sum of all “Depreciation” lines)\n  ≈ 91,503.27\n\nThen the “profit before tax” is computed as\n\n Profit before tax = (Sales profit + Interest receipts) – (Expenses + Depreciation)\n  ≈ (2,271,433.90 + 15,414.09) – (607,586.01 + 91,503.27)\n  ≈ 2,286,847.99 – 699,089.28\n  ≈ 1,587,758.71\n\nThus, the final “Profit Before Tax” is about 1,587,758.71.\n\nBelow is our answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Profit Before Tax\": \"1587758.71\"} }",
