In our “inventory” of transactions the only row affecting non‐current assets is the initial entry with type “Fixed Assets” (with an amount of 5,000,000) and the two depreciation entries. (All the other rows relate to current transactions such as cash deposits, sales, administrative or operating expenses, inventory‐related purchases, etc.) \n\nStep 1. The Initial Fixed Assets amount is taken from the “Initial20231231001” row with type “Fixed Assets”:  \n  Initial value = 5,000,000.00\n\nStep 2. The depreciation transactions reduce the value of fixed assets. In our data there are two depreciation transactions:  \n  • Depreciation20240101001 with amount = 45,751.67  \n  • Depreciation20240201002 with amount = 45,751.60\n\nStep 3. Total depreciation is the sum of the two:  \n  Total Depreciation = 45,751.67 + 45,751.60 = 91,503.27\n\nStep 4. Finally, the non-current asset end value is computed by subtracting the accumulated depreciation from the initial balance:  \n  Ending value = 5,000,000.00 − 91,503.27 = 4,908,496.73\n\nPresenting the results in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"4908496.73\"\n  }\n}",
