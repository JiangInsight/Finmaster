                        "content": "We must “build” the balance‐sheet “liabilities” value by looking for transactions that increase liabilities. In our system the Initial “opening” records (the “Initial20231231001” rows) all represent asset items (cash, bank and fixed assets) so they do not add to “liabilities.” Then we go over the other transactions. In our case only some PURCHASE transactions have an “Unpaid” payment status and their payment method is “Account Payable” (i.e. the company has not yet “paid” the vendor so that amount is a liability on the books).\n\nStep‑by‑step inspection of the new problem’s rows indicates that:\n • Row 8 – “Purchase20231231001” is a Purchase for 2000.0, Unpaid and with payment method “Account Payable.”\n • Row 41 – “Purchase20231231007” is Unpaid for 60000.0.\n • Row 84 – “Purchase20231231016” is Unpaid for 200000.0.\n • Row 123 – “Purchase20231231020” is Unpaid for 40000.0.\n\nAll other purchase transactions are “Paid” (or use another payment method) so they do not show as outstanding liabilities.\n\nThus, the total “liabilities” at the end (all outstanding amounts) is computed as:\n  2000.0 + 60000.0 + 200000.0 + 40000.0 = 302000.0\n\nBecause initially there were no liabilities (only opening asset entries), the “Total Liabilities Initial Value” is “0.00”.\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n      \"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n      \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"302000.00\"\n  }\n}",
