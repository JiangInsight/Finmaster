                        "content": "We need to “build” the Accounts Payable balance from all transactions that represent a purchase made on credit (i.e. the purchase was recorded as “Unpaid” with a payment method of “Account Payable”). In our file the initial “bootstrap” (the three “Initial…” transactions) do not include any AP balance (they simply record deposits or fixed‑asset acquisition). Then we examine each purchase row.\n\nStep‑by‑step review:\n\n1. Look at all transactions whose type is “Purchase”. Then “filter” them by:\n  – Payment/receipt_status contains “Unpaid”\n  – Payment_method is “Account Payable”\n\nIn our data the following purchases meet this criterion:\n\n• ID “Purchase20231231001”: amount = 2000.0, status = Unpaid, payment_method = Account Payable.\n• ID “Purchase20231231007”: amount = 60000.0, status = Unpaid, payment_method = Account Payable.\n• ID “Purchase20231231016”: amount = 200000.0, status = Unpaid, payment_method = Account Payable.\n• ID “Purchase20231231020”: amount = 40000.0, status = Unpaid, payment_method = Account Payable.\n\n2. Sum these amounts:\n  2000.0 + 60000.0 = 62000.0  \n  62000.0 + 200000.0 = 262000.0  \n  262000.0 + 40000.0 = 302000.0\n\n3. Since no beginning balance of payable is given (the initial transactions do not create any payable amounts) the Accounts Payable Begin Value is zero.\n\nThus the final Accounts Payable balance is 302000.00.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON output format is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"302000.00\"\n  }\n}",
