In our case the only transaction that fits this criterion is the one acquiring “Fixed Assets” (which – in a cash flow statement – is normally shown as a cash outflow for investing activities). (All the other entries – for example the “Initial Cash deposit” and “Initial Bank deposit” – are part of the financing section, while the “Purchase” rows in which the company buys everyday goods or services are considered operating flows. Also, “Depreciation” entries are noncash.) \n\nIn our data the only investing item is the row\n\n  Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | … | amount = 5000000.0\n\nThis represents a cash outflow of 5 000 000.0 in investing. (There is no sale or other acquisition that would offset this.) \n\nThus the net cash flow from investing activities is a negative 5 000 000.0.\n\nThe answer is then presented in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-5000000.0\"\n  }\n}",
