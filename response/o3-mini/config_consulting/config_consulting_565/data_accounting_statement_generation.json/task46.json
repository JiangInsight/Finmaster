In this case, there are three initial entries recorded on 2023‑12‑31:\n\n• Cash deposit for 3,000,000.0 \n• Bank deposit for 5,000,000.0 \n• Fixed Assets for 5,000,000.0\n\nWhen calculating the beginning cash and cash equivalents, only cash and bank deposits are considered as liquid. Fixed assets—despite being recorded on the opening balance—are not “cash equivalents.” \n\nThus, the beginning cash and cash equivalents balance is the sum of the cash deposit and the bank deposit:\n  3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 = 8,000,000.0\n\nThis is our final balance for beginning cash and cash equivalents.\n\nBelow is the solution in the requested JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\"} }\n```",
