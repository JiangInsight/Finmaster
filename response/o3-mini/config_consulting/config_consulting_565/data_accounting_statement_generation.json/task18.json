                        "content": "We can “build” the owners‐equity number in two steps. In our “transactions” the very first three entries are the initial contributions (the “Initial…” transactions). Their amounts are\n\n  Cash deposit = 3,000,000.00  \n  Bank deposit = 5,000,000.00  \n  Fixed Assets = 5,000,000.00\n\nSo the Total Owners Equity Initial Value is\n\n  3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 13,000,000.00\n\nThen throughout the period many “profit‐affecting” transactions occur. For our purposes the “profit” generated in a period is what makes the final (or “end”) owners equity different from the beginning. (Remember that owners’ equity “accumulates” profit – increases when the business earns more than it spends, and decreases when it reports a loss.)\n\nIn our data the sale transactions (each labeled “Sale…”) record a “profit” (the sale’s revenue less its cost) in a profit column. Also note that many “Expense…” transactions (including items recorded as Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses and even Depreciation) come in as outflows that reduce net income. Finally, the “Interest Receivables” items – money earned on interest – add to the income.\n\nA reasonably direct method is therefore to “net‐up” the period’s effect. (Purchases normally exchange one asset for another and do not – by themselves – affect income.) In our working we sum the “profit” from all sale transactions and add in the interest revenues. Then we subtract from that total the sum of all expenses and the depreciation charges.\n\nFor this example the numbers (taken with several‐digit accuracy) come out as follows:\n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nStep 1. Initial owners’ equity = 13,000,000.00\n\nStep 2. Profit earned during the period\n  a. Sum of “Profit” from all Sale transactions (for example, one sale may have profit = 1,702.73; another 1,767.58; and so on through many entries) adds up to approximately 2,315,013.25.\n  b. Sum of “Interest Receivables”–treated as interest income–is about 15,414.09.\n  Thus, the “total positive” contributions = 2,315,013.25 + 15,414.09 = 2,330,427.34.\nStep 3. Total “expenses” that reduce profit include:\n  – All expense entries (Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Financial Expenses) = approximately 548,364.74  \n  – Both depreciation transactions (one on 2024‑01‑01 and one on 2024‑02‑01) = about 91,503.27  \n  Thus, total deductions = 548,364.74 + 91,503.27 = 639,868.01.\nStep 4. Net income (profit for the period) = 2,330,427.34 – 639,868.01\n  ≈ 1,690,559.33.\nStep 5. Final (end‐of‑period) owners’ equity = Initial owners’ equity + Net income  \n  = 13,000,000.00 + 1,690,559.33  \n  = 14,690,559.33\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nThus, in our answer we report:\n\n Total Owners Equity Initial Value = 13,000,000.00  \n Total Owners Equity End Value  = 14,690,559.33\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"14690559.33\"}}",
