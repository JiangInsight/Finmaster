                        "content": "We must “build” the balance‐sheet “Accounts Receivable” value by “adding” all customer sales on “credit” (that is, where the “receive_method” is “Account Receviable” and the payment/receipt_status is Unpaid) and then also include any “interest receivable” entries (which appear as separate “Interest Receivables” transaction records that also are “Unpaid”). (Any sales recorded as “Paid” are assumed to have already been collected so they do not appear in AR.) Also note that in this dataset there is no “initial” AR balance because none of the “Initial” transactions is for AR. (In our sample the initial AR was 0.)\n\nBelow you see one way to “break‐down” the computation step‐by‐step:\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. First, note the “Initial” transactions have no AR (the three “Initial…” records are for Cash, Bank and Fixed Assets).\n\n2. Next, among all transactions of type “Sale” we select only those whose “receive_method” is “Account Receviable” and whose “payment/receipt_status” is Unpaid. (For example, the transaction with id “Sale20240103004” is a Sale with amount 2,702.73, receive_method “Account Receviable” and status Unpaid; similarly many other Sale transactions qualify.) When we add up all such “Sale” amounts we obtain approximately 3,148,338.94.\n\n3. In addition the table includes many “Interest Receivables” transactions (type starts with “Interest…”) – again we include only those whose status is “Unpaid.” When we add the amounts on these lines we obtain about 15,414.09.\n\n4. (There are no cash–collected sales recorded on “Account Receivable” so nothing is subtracted.)\n\n5. Thus the final ending “Accounts Receivable” is the sum of the sales receivables plus the interest receivables:\n  3,148,338.94 + 15,414.09 ≈ 3,163,753.03\n\n6. Since there is no opening balance for receivables, the initial AR is 0.00.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThus, in our balance‐sheet the “Accounts Receivable” item is as follows:\n\nInitial Value: 0.00 \nEnding Value: 3163753.03\n\nNow we present the answer as requested in the JSON format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"3163753.03\"\n  }\n}",
