                        "content": "We must “build” the current‐liability balance by picking out the transactions that increase the “money we owe” to suppliers. In our (simplified) system the only entries that generate a “current liability” are purchase transactions whose “payment/receipt_status” is Unpaid – that is, when we have “Account Payable.” (Other types of entries – for example, cash, bank or fixed assets, paid operating expenses, or sales and “Interest Receivables” – are either asset or expense items and do not contribute to current liabilities.)\n\nStep 1. Identify the “initial” transactions.\n• The three “Initial20231231001” entries (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) are all starting‐balance entries for assets so they do not belong on the “current liabilities” side. Hence, the “initial” current liabilities amount is 0.00.\n\nStep 2. Go through the purchase transactions and look only at those with Unpaid status (and in these examples the “payment_method” is “Account Payable”). In our data there are four purchase entries that meet that criterion:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001 – amount = 2000.0 and marked “Unpaid”\n2. Purchase20231231007 – amount = 60000.0 and marked “Unpaid”\n3. Purchase20231231016 – amount = 200000.0 and marked “Unpaid”\n4. Purchase20231231020 – amount = 40000.0 and marked “Unpaid”\n\nStep 3. Sum these amounts:\n 2000.0 + 60000.0 = 62000.0  \n 62000.0 + 200000.0 = 262000.0  \n 262000.0 + 40000.0 = 302000.0\n\nThus, at the end of the period the company owes 302000.00 (all from unpaid supplier bills).\n\nSo, our answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', 'Total Current Liabilities End Value': '302000.00'}}",
