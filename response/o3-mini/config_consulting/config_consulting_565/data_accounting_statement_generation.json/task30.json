In our table only the following transaction types contribute to total expenses:\n• Any row whose type begins with “Expense” (for example, Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Financial Expenses, etc.)\n• Rows with “Depreciation” (even though they do not have an “Expense” prefix, they are an operating expense).\n\nOther types such as “Initial …”, “Purchase …”, “Sale …”, “Interest Receivables …”, “Transfer …” are not “expense” items on the income statement (note: in our table “Interest Receivables” are treated like interest income, not an expense).\n\nTo show our work we list the rows that are “expense‐related” with the “amount” value:\n\n  • Expense20240101001 – Sales Expenses:   19870.28  \n  • Expense20240101001 – Administrative Expenses: 2114.13  \n  • Depreciation20240101001 – Depreciation:     45751.67  \n  • Expense20240102001 – Sales Expenses:     9101.97  \n  • Expense20240102001 – Sales Expenses:     18224.98  \n  • Expense20240103001 – Administrative Expenses: 18579.64  \n  • Expense20240103001 – Administrative Expenses: 7334.11  \n  • Expense20240104001 – Sales Expenses:     17872.03  \n  • Expense20240105001 – Administrative Expenses: 2928.40  \n  • Expense20240105001 – Sales Expenses:     14588.99  \n  • Expense20240106001 – Sales Expenses:     8281.46  \n  • Expense20240107001 – Sales Expenses:     5212.63  \n  • Expense20240107001 – Sales Expenses:     4613.02  \n  • Expense20240108001 – Sales Expenses:     11443.14  \n  • Expense20240109001 – Financial Expenses:   12133.89  \n  • Expense20240110001 – Sales Expenses:     17779.73  \n  • Expense20240111001 – Sales Expenses:     3937.02  \n  • Expense20240112001 – Administrative Expenses: 16185.87  \n  • Expense20240112001 – Sales Expenses:     6956.35  \n  • Expense20240113001 – Sales Expenses:     11218.42  \n  • Expense20240114001 – Administrative Expenses: 14999.27  \n  • Expense20240115001 – Sales Expenses:     7625.62  \n  • Expense20240116001 – Financial Expenses:   15552.40  \n  • Expense20240116001 – Sales Expenses:     18183.56  \n  • Expense20240117001 – Sales Expenses:     8139.11  \n  • Expense20240117001 – Administrative Expenses: 19782.71  \n  • Expense20240118001 – Sales Expenses:     18791.29  \n  • Expense20240119001 – Sales Expenses:     16577.94  \n  • Expense20240119001 – Administrative Expenses: 10111.54  \n  • Expense20240120001 – Sales Expenses:     9285.32  \n  • Expense20240120001 – Sales Expenses:     19721.98  \n  • Expense20240121001 – Administrative Expenses: 17283.46  \n  • Expense20240122001 – Financial Expenses:   5817.31  \n  • Expense20240123001 – Financial Expenses:   13328.23  \n  • Expense20240124001 – Sales Expenses:     12101.39  \n  • Expense20240125001 – Sales Expenses:     13067.33  \n  • Expense20240125001 – Sales Expenses:     10616.52  \n  • Expense20240126001 – Sales Expenses:     17487.41  \n  • Expense20240127001 – Sales Expenses:     4377.51  \n  • Expense20240127001 – Financial Expenses:   14631.91  \n  • Expense20240128001 – Financial Expenses:   19930.48  \n  • Expense20240128001 – Sales Expenses:     5863.41  \n  • Expense20240129001 – Sales Expenses:     13772.83  \n  • Expense20240130001 – Administrative Expenses: 8231.46  \n  • Expense20240130001 – Administrative Expenses: 15204.39  \n  • Expense20240131001 – Sales Expenses:     15276.33  \n  • Expense20240201001 – Administrative Expenses: 11100.38  \n  • Depreciation20240201002 – Depreciation:    45751.60  \n  • Expense20240202001 – Administrative Expenses: 3768.56  \n  • Expense20240203001 – Sales Expenses:     2285.80  \n  • Expense20240203001 – Sales Expenses:     7952.47  \n  • Expense20240204001 – Administrative Expenses: 3715.60  \n  • Expense20240204001 – Administrative Expenses: 11844.44  \n  • Expense20240205001 – Administrative Expenses: 2046.68  \n  • Expense20240205001 – Sales Expenses:     10735.31  \n\nWhen we add up all these amounts the total is approximately 699089.28.\n\n(For example, grouping the early “Expense” rows (from row 4 through row 121) the running total came to about 521609.54; then adding the subsequent expense rows from row 124 through row 157 we obtain an additional 177479.74. Their sum is 521609.54 + 177479.74 = 699089.28.)\n\nThus the final total expenses item in the income statement is 699089.28.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Expenses\": \"699089.28\"}}",
