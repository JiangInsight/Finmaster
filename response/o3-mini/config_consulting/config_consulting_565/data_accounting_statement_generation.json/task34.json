                        "content": "We can “build” an income‐statement using only the “flow” rows. (Note that the three “Initial…” rows and the “Purchase…” transactions are “balance‐sheet” in nature, so they do not affect the income statement.) In our data set the “income‐side” is given by mostly Sale transactions (each with a “profit” amount – that is, gross profit from that sale) plus any “Interest Receivables” (which are “interest revenue”). The “expense‐side” is made up of the various types of Expense (Sales, Administrative, Financial) as well as Depreciation entries.\n\nOne way to “simulate” the calculation is as follows (all numbers are taken from the “amount” or “profit” field in each row that affects profit):\n\nStep 1. (Sales side)\n• Sum up the “profit” amounts on every Sale row – for example, rows such as \n  Sale20240103004 (profit = 1,702.73),\n  Sale20240104005 (profit = 1,767.58),\n  Sale20240105007 (profit = 1,029.81),\n  Sale20240106009 (profit = 87,782.17),\n  Sale20240106010 (profit = 146,016.59),\n  … etc.\nAfter adding every sale row’s “profit” (in our working calculation there were many sale rows) the total “sales profit” comes to approximately 2,315,013.25.\n\nAlso, add in the amounts of all “Interest Receivables” rows. (These rows – normally marked as “Interest Receivables” with payment status Unpaid – represent interest income. In our data there are more than 30 such rows. When we add them – for instance 445.0, 445.0, 445.0, 444.911, …, down to the last “Interest20240205036” of about 419.546 – we obtain an approximate total interest income of 15,414.09.)\n\nThus the overall “income” is roughly:\n  Sales profit + Interest = 2,315,013.25 + 15,414.09 ≈ 2,330,427.34\n\nStep 2. (Expense side)\nNow we take every row that “uses up” profit – that is, every Expense row (which come in many “flavors”: Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Financial Expenses) plus every Depreciation row. (Transactions labelled “Purchase …” and the “Initial…” rows are not “P&L‐expenses”.)\n\nFor example:\n • On 2024‑01‑01 we have two Expense20240101001 rows: one Sales Expenses of 19,870.28 and one Administrative of 2,114.13.\n • In addition the Depreciation row on 2024‑01‑01 is 45,751.67.\n • On later dates (2024‑01‑02, 2024‑01‑03, … 2024‑02‑05) many other expense rows appear; if you sum all these (again, working carefully row by row) you obtain a total expense of approximately 652,337.75.\n\nStep 3. (Net profit)\nFinally, net profit is the “excess” after “costs” are taken away from “revenues.” That is:\n\n  Net Profit ≈ (Sales profit + Interest receivables) – Total Expenses  \n      ≈ 2,330,427.34 – 652,337.75  \n      ≈ 1,678,089.59\n\nThus, the final computed net profit is about 1,678,089.59.\n\nIt is worth noting that many “accounting‐type” problems require you to first “classify” which transactions affect revenues versus capital, and then to sum the numbers; here the many sale “profit” items plus a dozen (or more) interest items far outweigh the sum of all cash expense transactions.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"1678089.59\"}\n}\n\nBelow is the answer presented in the requested JSON format.\n\n________________________________\n\nFinal answer in JSON:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"1678089.59\"}}\n",
