                        "content": "We need to determine how the “Accounts Payable” balance has changed over this reporting period. In our “Purchase” entries (which are the only transactions that directly affect (or create) payables) we must identify those that are made on credit – that is, with payment‐status “Unpaid” and with the payment method “Account Payable.” Then any payments that clear those payables would “reduce” the account, but in our data the “Purchase” transactions that use “Account Payable” and remain “Unpaid” represent a balance increase in AP.\n\nLet’s “scan” through the list:\n\n1. In the row with id “Purchase20231231001” the purchase amount is 2,000.0; it is “Unpaid” and its payment method is “Account Payable.” This increases AP by 2,000.0.\n\n2. Looking through the list, the next purchase that is “Unpaid” and uses “Account Payable” is row with id “Purchase20231231007” – amount 60,000.0. This adds +60,000.0.\n\n3. Then the row “Purchase20231231016” is “Unpaid” (and its method is “Account Payable”) for an amount of 200,000.0. This adds +200,000.0.\n\n4. Finally, the row “Purchase20231231020” is “Unpaid” with a payment method “Account Payable” for an amount of 40,000.0. This adds +40,000.0.\n\nAll the other purchase entries have a “Paid” status (or use another payment method) and therefore have already been paid (or do not affect the AP balance).\n\nNow, summing up the credit (unpaid) purchases:\n  2,000.0 + 60,000.0 = 62,000.0  \n  62,000.0 + 200,000.0 = 262,000.0  \n  262,000.0 + 40,000.0 = 302,000.0\n\nThere are no other transactions that adjust AP (for example, there are no separate “cash payments” that refer to reducing AP in these data rows).\n\nThus the overall “Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable” is an increase of 302,000.00.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"302000.00\"}}\n```",
