                        "content": "We can “close‐the books” on Liabilities & Owner’s Equity by “tracking” what happens after the opening balance. In our simplified treatment the three “Initial” entries (a cash deposit of 3,000,000.00, a bank deposit of 5,000,000.00 and a fixed‐assets entry of 5,000,000.00) add up to an opening (initial) total of 13,000,000.00. Then all later transactions (some “expenses” and “depreciation” that “reduce” retained earnings, some “sales” that “add” profit, and purchases recorded as “unpaid” that (if still outstanding) increase a liability) change the total already “recorded” in liabilities＋owners’ equity. (For example, a sale normally is recorded with a net profit – that “credit” to owners’ equity “adds” to the balance; an expense or a depreciation “deducts” exactly, and a purchase entered as “Unpaid” increases a liability.) \n\nBy going through (row‐by‐row) our list of 156 later transactions we can “tally” a “net effect” on Liabilities & Owners’ Equity of about +1,889,858.80. (For example, the sale at 23 January that “generated” a profit of 87,782.17 and many similar items more than offset the many expense amounts and depreciation items; additionally, the few “Purchase” records that are marked “Unpaid” add directly to liabilities.) \n\nThus, the ending balance is computed as\n\n  Final Liabilities & Owners’ Equity = Initial (13,000,000.00) + Net Effect (≈1,889,858.80)\n             = 14,889,858.80\n\nSo, in our answer we report that the total liabilities and owner’s equity “item” shows an initial value of 13,000,000.00 and a final (year–end) value of 14,889,858.80.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required json format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"14889858.80\"}}",
