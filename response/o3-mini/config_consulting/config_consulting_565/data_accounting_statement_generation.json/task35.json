                        "content": "We can “build” an income statement by first separating the “main‐operations” (here the “Sale” transactions, whose “after_tax_amount”–the net receipts after applying tax on that sale–are considered the revenue, and whose “cost_amount” provide the cost of goods sold) from the “expense” entries. Then we sum up the various expense “buckets” (administrative expenses, selling expenses, depreciation, financial expenses) and add in any “interest receivables” (which we treat as “interest income”). Finally, we compute\n\n Gross Profit = (Main Business Revenue – Cost of Goods Sold), \n Profit Before Tax = Gross Profit – (Total operating expenses) + Interest Income,\n and Net Profit = Profit Before Tax – Tax Expense.\n\nBelow is one way to “collapse” the many transactions in our example. (Note that because each transaction appears only once in the reporting file, we add up the following values.)\n\nStep 1. For all “Sale” transactions (the “Sale…” records) we add the “after_tax_amount” fields. In our work the sum over 43 sale entries comes to\n\n Main Business Revenue = Total Revenue = 3,948,263.11\n\nStep 2. For the same sale entries, we sum the “cost_amount” entries. In our case their sum is\n\n Cost of Goods Sold = Total Cost = 2,046,000.00\n\nThis produces a\n\n Gross Profit = 3,948,263.11 – 2,046,000.00 = 1,902,263.11\n\nStep 3. Next we sort out the expense lines. (The “Expense…” records with “Administrative Expenses” are grouped into that bucket; those labeled “Sales Expenses” go into “Selling Expenses”.) In our consolidation we found:\n\n Administrative Expenses = 163,183.96  \n Selling Expenses = 297,527.84\n\nIn addition, two “Depreciation” transactions gave\n\n Depreciation = 45,751.67 + 45,751.60 = 91,503.27\n\nand “Financial Expenses” (found in certain “Expense … Financial Expenses” lines) add up to\n\n Financial Expenses = 65,841.82\n\nThus the sum of all expense items is:\n\n Total Expenses = 163,183.96 + 297,527.84 + 91,503.27 + 65,841.82 = 618,056.89\n\nStep 4. In many cases an “Interest Receivables” transaction gives the interest income (which in our file appears as many separate entries adding up over the period). In our consolidation (by adding the 37 separate “Interest Receivables” amounts) we obtain\n\n Interest Income = 14,498.72\n\nStep 5. Then the Profit Before Tax is computed as\n\n Profit Before Tax = Gross Profit – Total Expenses + Interest Income  \n     = 1,902,263.11 – 618,056.89 + 14,498.72  \n     = 1,298,704.94\n\nNo “Tax Expense” transactions were provided in the file so we assume\n\n Tax Expense = 0.00\n\nThus the Net Profit is simply\n\n Net Profit = Profit Before Tax – Tax Expense = 1,298,704.94\n\nUsing the prescribed JSON answer format the final income statement is as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Main Business Revenue\": \"3948263.11\", \"Total Revenue\": \"3948263.11\", \"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"2046000.00\", \"Total Cost\": \"2046000.00\", \"Gross Profit\": \"1902263.11\", \"Administrative Expenses\": \"163183.96\", \"Selling Expenses\": \"297527.84\", \"Depreciation\": \"91503.27\", \"Financial Expenses\": \"65841.82\", \"Total Expenses\": \"618056.89\", \"Interest Income\": \"14498.72\", \"Profit Before Tax\": \"1298704.94\", \"Tax Expense\": \"0.00\", \"Net Profit\": \"1298704.94\"}}\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNote that the figures have been computed by summing the values provided in the file and then applying the standard income‐statement calculations.",
