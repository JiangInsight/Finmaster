                        "content": "We first notice that the “Fixed Assets” balance comes from two sources:\n1. The beginning (initial) balance given on 2023‑12‑31 which is a “Fixed Assets” transaction for 5,000,000.00.\n2. Any “Fixed Assets” purchase or additional investment during the period should be added on top of the initial amount.\n\nIn the sample example the only change was an additional “Fixed Assets Purchase” of 305,354.43 so that the ending fixed asset balance was:\n  initial 5,000,000.00 + 305,354.43 = 5,305,354.43\n\nNow looking at the provided data for the problem:\n• The first three rows give the opening balances. In particular, the “Fixed Assets” row shows 5,000,000.00.\n• The rest of the table shows many transactions (sales, expenses, purchases, depreciation, etc.) but none of these are additional fixed asset purchases (i.e. no row of type “Fixed Assets Purchase” or another “Fixed Assets” record is present).\n\nBecause there is no fixed asset purchase recorded during the period, the fixed asset item is unchanged.\n\nThus:\n  Fixed Assets Initial Value = 5,000,000.00\n  Fixed Assets End Value = 5,000,000.00\n\nWe now present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"5000000.00\"}}",
