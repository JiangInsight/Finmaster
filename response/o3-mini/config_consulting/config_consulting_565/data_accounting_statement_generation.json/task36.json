                        "content": "We must “re‐build” the “income” result from the transaction list. In our posting the idea is to “take” the profit (or “gain”) that appears on each sale (the sale rows include a computed profit in their last column) and then “reduce” that by all operating “expense” items – the cost “spent” for expenses (including the Sales/Administrative/Financial expenses) and the non–cash charge (depreciation). (Other items – such as the purchase or the initial cash/bank deposit – are “balance‐sheet” events and are not “income‐statement” items.) Also, note that some “interest receivables” appear on the list. These represent “income” (even though not yet “collected”) so they are added.\n\nIn our table the idea is to compute:\n\n  Net Profit = (sum of all sale “profit” amounts) \n        + (sum of all interest receivable amounts) \n        – (sum of all expense amounts from “Expense …” rows)\n        – (sum of depreciation amounts)\n\nStep‑by‑step (values rounded to two–decimals):\n\n1. Sum of profit from all Sale rows \n  ≈ 2,314,013.25\n\n2. Sum of “Interest Receivables” amounts \n  ≈ 14,994.45\n\n3. Sum of all expense–type transactions (i.e. sales expenses, administrative expenses, financial expenses, etc.) \n  ≈ 517,472.06\n\n4. Sum of depreciation amounts \n  ≈ 91,503.27\n\nTherefore the “total outflow” (expenses+depreciation) is about \n  517,472.06 + 91,503.27 = 608,975.33\n\nThen the net profit is computed as\n\n  Net Profit ≈ (2,314,013.25 + 14,994.45) – 608,975.33 \n            ≈ 2,329,007.70 – 608,975.33 \n            ≈ 1,720,032.37\n\nThus, the final net profit appearing (to two‐decimals) in the cash flow statement would be about 1,720,032.37.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"1720032.37\"} }\n------------------------------------------------\n\n(Notes: In practice one needs to “pick out” only the transactions that affect the income statement (sales–related profit plus recognized interest income) and “offset” them by normal operating expense and depreciation; deposits, fixed asset purchases, and purchases of supplies/inventory are balance‐sheet events.)",
