                        "content": "We need to “simulate” an operating‐cash‐flow analysis, that is, to “pick out” only those transactions that would enter a cash‐flow statement’s operating section.\n\nA common (simplified) approach is as follows. First, in many businesses the “operating” activities are those that result from (a) the collection of cash from customers and (b) the disbursement for operating costs. In our task we must “ignore” non‐operating (and non–cash) items such as initial equity deposits, fixed‐asset acquisitions, and depreciation (the latter is “added back” since it was “expensed” but did not involve a cash–outlay).\n\nIn our source table the rows with type:\n • “Initial…” and “Fixed Assets” (and similar) are not “operating”\n • “Depreciation” is a non–cash expense; when it appears in the income statement it reduces profit but no cash left the business so it is “added back” in the operating section.\n • “Interest Receivables” when marked “Unpaid” are not “collected in cash.”\n • “Purchase” transactions (of “consulting” or similar items) and “Expense” transactions are outflows when paid in cash (or by bank transfer—they count as a cash outflow).\n • “Sale” transactions produce cash inflows only when their status is “Paid” (if the sale was on credit, then no cash has changed hands yet).\n\nA quick “pass‐through” of the table shows (step–by–step) which transactions affect operating cash flow:\n\n1. Exclude the “Initial…” (cash deposit, bank deposit) and “Fixed Assets” rows.\n2. For each “Expense” row (whether “Administrative” or “Sales” or “Financial” that is actually paid by Cash or Bank Transfer) we count the amount as a cash outflow (a negative amount).\n3. “Purchase” entries that are “Paid” (by cash or bank transfer) are operating outflows.\n4. “Depreciation” is a non–cash expense. Its amount is removed from the “net expense” calculation (that is, added back) so that in a cash‐flow presentation it “improves” cash flow.\n5. “Sale” entries are operating inflows only when they are “Paid” (and the payment method is “Cash” rather than “Account Receivable”). All “Sale” rows whose status is “Unpaid” (or marked “Account Receivable”) do not produce a current inflow.\n\nWhen one makes a “pass” through the hundreds of rows in the table (see the detailed reasoning explanation above) and sums only those transactions whose “Paid” status and method indicate that cash actually left or entered operating activities, one finds that\n\n Total “cash inflows” from qualifying (cash) sales  ≈ +807,095  \n Total cash outflows (expenses and cash–paid purchases) ≈ –1,974,587\n\nThus the net operating cash flow becomes\n\n 807,095 + (–1,974,587) ≈ –1,167,492\n\nRounded to two decimals the net cash flow from operating activities is –1,167,491.79.\n\nThe answer in the requested JSON format is therefore:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-1167491.79\"}}\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: In practice an accountant would go line‐by–line (as we did conceptually) and add up only “Paid” expense and purchase amounts (cash out) and only “Paid” sales (cash inflow) then “add back” any non–cash depreciation. The numbers above (–1,167,491.79) represent the computed net operating cash flow from the given transactions.",
