                        "content": "We begin by “opening” the books as of 31‑Dec‑2023. Notice that one of the three “Initial” rows is for a “Bank deposit” – it records 5,000,000.00 in that account. (The “Cash deposit” and “Fixed Assets” lines do not belong in the bank deposit account.) \n\nThen we look among all subsequent transactions for any entry in which money is paid “by bank transfer” (this is the only indicator that a payment came out of the bank account). (Sales made on “Account Receivable” and expenses paid in cash do not affect the bank‐deposit balance.) In our table the following rows use a “Bank Transfer” as payment method (and are marked “Paid”), which we interpret as having reduced the bank deposit:\n\n• Row with id Purchase20231231001 is using “Account Payable” (thus no bank–transfer) so we skip it.\n\n• Row “Purchase20231231002”: amount = 1,000.00 (payment method = Bank Transfer)\n• Row “Purchase20231231004”: amount = 1,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n• Row “Purchase20231231005”: amount = 20,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n• Row “Purchase20231231006”: amount = 10,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n• Row “Purchase20231231010”: amount = 3,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n• Row “Purchase20231231011”: amount = 200,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n• Row “Purchase20231231012”: amount = 20,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n• Row “Purchase20231231013”: amount = 10,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n• Row “Purchase20231231015”: amount = 20,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n• Row “Purchase20231231022”: amount = 1,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n\nLet’s sum these outflow amounts:\n  1,000 + 1,000 = 2,000  \n  2,000 + 20,000 = 22,000  \n  22,000 + 10,000 = 32,000  \n  32,000 + 3,000 = 35,000  \n  35,000 + 200,000 = 235,000  \n  235,000 + 20,000 = 255,000  \n  255,000 + 10,000 = 265,000  \n  265,000 + 20,000 = 285,000  \n  285,000 + 1,000 = 286,000\n\nSo the total reduction from the bank‐deposit is 286,000.\n\nSubtract this from the opening bank deposit (5,000,000):\n  5,000,000 – 286,000 = 4,714,000\n\nThus, the bank deposit account started at 5,000,000.00 and ended at 4,714,000.00.\n\nWe now report the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Bank Deposits Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Bank Deposits End Value': '4714000.00'} }",
