                        "content": "First we need to extract the relevant numbers from the statements. We work with the “End_amount” values (or “Ending Balance”) as given by the date 2024-02-05.\n\nStep 1. Calculate the Current Ratio  \n • Current Assets: The balance sheet gives \"Total Current Assets\" = 10,022,038.12  \n • Current Liabilities: \"Total Current Liabilities\" = 967,271.87  \n  Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \n  = 10,022,038.12 / 967,271.87 ≈ 10.36\n\nStep 2. Calculate the Quick Ratio  \nQuick assets are typically all current assets less the inventory. (You might also sum only cash, bank deposits, receivables etc.)  \n • Inventory = 174,000.00  \n • Quick Assets = Total Current Assets – Inventory  \n  = 10,022,038.12 – 174,000.00 = 9,848,038.12  \n • Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities  \n  = 9,848,038.12 / 967,271.87 ≈ 10.17\n\nStep 3. Calculate Debt to Asset Ratio  \nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets  \nIn the balance sheet only current liabilities (Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable) are given as liabilities. Hence:  \n • Total Liabilities = 967,271.87  \n • Total Assets = 14,930,535.06  \n  Debt to Asset Ratio = 967,271.87 / 14,930,535.06 ≈ 0.0648  \nRounded to two decimal places this is approximately 0.07.\n\nStep 4. Calculate Debt to Equity Ratio  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity  \n • Total Liabilities = 967,271.87  \n • Owner’s Equity = 13,963,263.19  \n  Debt to Equity Ratio = 967,271.87 / 13,963,263.19 ≈ 0.0693  \nRounded, this is approximately 0.07.\n\nStep 5. Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \nThis ratio is defined here as Operating Cash Flow divided by Total Debt (liabilities).  \n • Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 116,257.19  \n • Total Debt = 967,271.87  \n  Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = 116,257.19 / 967,271.87 ≈ 0.1202  \nRounded, about 0.12.\n\nThus, the answers are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"10.36\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"10.17\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.07\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.07\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"0.12\"\n  }\n}",
