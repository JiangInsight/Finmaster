                        "content": "Step 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n• Formula: Main Business Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n• Here, beginning AR = 0 and ending AR = 1,716,911.17, so the average AR = (0 + 1,716,911.17) / 2 = 858,455.585.  \n• Main Business Revenue = 3,025,437.82  \n• Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 3,025,437.82 / 858,455.585 ≈ 3.52  \n\nStep 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n• Both ratios in these examples are calculated as: Operating Cash Flow / Total Current Liabilities.  \n• Operating Cash Flow (from the cash flow statement) = 116,257.19  \n• Total Current Liabilities (end balance) = 967,271.87  \n• Ratio = 116,257.19 / 967,271.87 ≈ 0.12  \n\nStep 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n• Formula: Total Revenue / Average Total Assets  \n• Total Assets at the beginning: 13,000,000.00 and at the end: 14,930,535.06 so the average = (13,000,000 + 14,930,535.06) / 2 ≈ 13,965,267.53  \n• Total Revenue = 3,025,437.82  \n• Total Asset Turnover Ratio = 3,025,437.82 / 13,965,267.53 ≈ 0.22  \n\nStep 4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n• Formula: Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity  \n• Here, Total Liabilities are represented by Total Current Liabilities = 967,271.87  \n• Total Owner's Equity (end) = 13,963,263.19  \n• Debt to Equity Ratio = 967,271.87 / 13,963,263.19 ≈ 0.07  \n\nThus, the final solution in JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.52\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"0.12\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"0.12\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.22\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.07\"\n  }\n}",
