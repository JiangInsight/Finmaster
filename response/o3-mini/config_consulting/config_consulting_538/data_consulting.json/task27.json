                        "content": "We start by extracting the relevant values from each statement:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio  \n • From the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 116257.19  \n • From the income statement, Net Profit = 963263.19  \n • Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Net Profit = 116257.19 / 963263.19 ≈ 0.1208  \n  Rounded to two decimals, this is approximately 0.12  \n\n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio  \n • We use Total Revenue (3025437.82) from the income statement.  \n • The balance sheet shows “Total Current Assets” at the beginning of the period is 8000000.00 and at the end is 10022038.12.  \n • Average Current Assets = (8000000.00 + 10022038.12) / 2 ≈ 9011019.06  \n • Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Current Assets = 3025437.82 / 9011019.06 ≈ 0.3359  \n  Rounded to two decimals, this is approximately 0.34  \n\n3. Quick Ratio  \n • Quick assets normally include items that can be converted quickly into cash. In this problem we sum: Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, and Accounts Receivable.  \n  Cash on Hand = 3537257.19  \n  Bank Deposits = 4579000.00  \n  Interest Receivable = 14869.76  \n  Accounts Receivable = 1716911.17  \n  Total Quick Assets = 3537257.19 + 4579000.00 + 14869.76 + 1716911.17 = 9848038.12  \n • Total Current Liabilities (from the balance sheet) = 967271.87  \n • Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities = 9848038.12 / 967271.87 ≈ 10.17  \n\nNow, presenting the result in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"0.12\",\n    \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.34\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"10.17\"\n  }\n}",
