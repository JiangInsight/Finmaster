The formula is:\n\n  Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit ÷ Total Revenue) × 100%\n\nUsing the provided data,\n  Gross Profit = 1,713,437.82\n  Total Revenue = 3,025,437.82\n\nThus,\n  Gross Profit Margin = (1,713,437.82 / 3,025,437.82) × 100% ≈ 56.60%\n\nNext we compute the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio. In the sample computation the “debt” was taken as the Total Current Liabilities. Using that approach here, we have:\n\n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 116,257.19  \n  Total Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 816,000.00 + 151,271.87 = 967,271.87\n\nSo the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is calculated as:\n  Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities ÷ Total Current Liabilities  \n  ≈ 116,257.19 / 967,271.87 ≈ 0.12\n\nThus, the final answers are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"56.60%\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"0.12\"\n  }\n}",
