Debt to Asset Ratio  \n   • From the balance sheet, Total Assets = 14,930,535.06 and Total Liabilities can be obtained by subtracting Owner’s Equity from Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity. Here, Owner's Equity is 13,963,263.19 so  \n  Total Liabilities = 14,930,535.06 – 13,963,263.19 = 967,271.87  \n   • Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets  \n  = 967,271.87 / 14,930,535.06 ≈ 0.0648  \n  Rounded to two decimals, that is ≈ 0.06\n\n2. Gross Profit Margin  \n   • From the income statement, Gross Profit = 1,713,437.82 and Total Revenue = 3,025,437.82  \n   • Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%  \n  = (1,713,437.82 / 3,025,437.82) × 100% ≈ 56.60%\n\n3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n   • From the cash flow statement, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 116,257.19 and Total Current Liabilities (from the balance sheet) = 967,271.87  \n   • Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Current Liabilities  \n  = 116,257.19 / 967,271.87 ≈ 0.1202  \n  Rounded to two decimals, that equals 0.12\n\nWe now present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.06\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"56.60%\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"0.12\"\n  }\n}",
