                        "content": "We will use the following formulas:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow ÷ Current Liabilities  \n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow ÷ (Total Debt)  \n  (In this problem, Total Debt is taken as the Current Liabilities since no non‐current liabilities are provided)  \n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold ÷ Average Inventory  \n  Since the beginning inventory is 0, Average Inventory = (0 + Ending Inventory) ÷ 2  \n4. Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities ÷ Total Owner’s Equity  \n5. Quick Ratio = (Total Current Assets − Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities  \n6. Current Ratio = Total Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities\n\nNow, let’s extract the numbers from the provided statements:\n\nA. From the balance sheet (End amounts):\n • Accounts Payable = 816,000.00  \n • Taxes Payable = 151,271.87  \n  ⇒ Total Current Liabilities = 816,000.00 + 151,271.87 = 967,271.87  \n\n • Total Current Assets = 10,022,038.12  \n • Inventory (Ending) = 174,000.00  \n • Total Owner’s Equity = 13,963,263.19  \n\nB. From the cash flow statement:\n • Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 116,257.19  \n\nC. From the income statement / cost info:\n • Cost of Goods Sold = 1,312,000.00  \n • Beginning inventory is zero, Ending Inventory = 174,000.00  \n  ⇒ Average Inventory = (0 + 174,000.00) ÷ 2 = 87,000.00\n\nNow we compute each ratio:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio = 116,257.19 ÷ 967,271.87  \n = 0.1202 ≈ 0.12\n\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = 116,257.19 ÷ 967,271.87  \n = 0.1202 ≈ 0.12\n\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio = 1,312,000.00 ÷ 87,000.00  \n = 15.080 ≈ 15.08\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio = 967,271.87 ÷ 13,963,263.19  \n = 0.0693 ≈ 0.07\n\n5. Quick Ratio = (Total Current Assets − Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities  \n = (10,022,038.12 − 174,000.00) ÷ 967,271.87  \n = 9,848,038.12 ÷ 967,271.87  \n ≈ 10.17\n\n6. Current Ratio = Total Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities  \n = 10,022,038.12 ÷ 967,271.87  \n ≈ 10.36\n\nThus, the solution in the requested JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"0.12\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"0.12\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"15.08\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.07\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"10.17\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"10.36\"\n  }\n}",
