The formula used is:\n\n  Operating Cash Flow Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Current Liabilities)\n\nStep 1: Identify the key numbers from the cash flow statement and balance sheet.\n\n• Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: 116257.19  \n• Total Current Liabilities: 967271.87\n\nStep 2: Compute the Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n  Ratio = 116257.19 / 967271.87 ≈ 0.12\n\nThus, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately 0.12.\n\nThe answer is presented below in the required format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"0.12\"\n  }\n}",
