                        "content": "We have to “build” the accounts‐payable liability from the purchases that were not paid (that is, where the “payment/receipt_status” is “Unpaid” or the “payment_method” is “Account Payable”). In our data the beginning (“Initial…”) rows are only asset setup (cash, bank, fixed assets) so the opening accounts payable balance is zero.\n\nThen we scan all transactions with type “Purchase” (from the rows dated 2023‑12‑31) that have “Unpaid” status and/or are “Account Payable.” In our problem these are the rows:\n\n1. Row with id Purchase20231231010 (date 2023‑12‑31): amount = 300,000.0, Paid status = Unpaid, Payment method = Account Payable.\n2. Row with id Purchase20231231011: amount = 1,000.0, Unpaid with payment method Account Payable.\n3. Row with id Purchase20231231014: amount = 15,000.0, Unpaid with payment method Account Payable.\n4. Row with id Purchase20231231018: amount = 60,000.0, Unpaid with payment method Account Payable.\n5. Row with id Purchase20231231024: amount = 20,000.0, Unpaid with payment method Account Payable.\n6. Row with id Purchase20231231025: amount = 5,000.0, Unpaid with payment method Account Payable.\n7. Row with id Purchase20231231026: amount = 300,000.0, Unpaid with payment method Account Payable.\n8. Row with id Purchase20231231029: amount = 15,000.0, Unpaid with payment method Account Payable.\n\nNow, summing these amounts:\n\n• 300,000.0  \n  + 1,000.0 = 301,000.0  \n  + 15,000.0 = 316,000.0  \n  + 60,000.0 = 376,000.0  \n  + 20,000.0 = 396,000.0  \n  + 5,000.0 = 401,000.0  \n  + 300,000.0 = 701,000.0  \n  + 15,000.0 = 716,000.0\n\nThus the accounts payable “end value” is 716,000.0; the opening value was 0.00.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"716000.00\"}}",
