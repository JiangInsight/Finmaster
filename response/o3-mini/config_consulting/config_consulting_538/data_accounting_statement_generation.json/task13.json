                        "content": "We reviewed every transaction – only the “Sale”‐transactions include a “tax_amount” value. None of the “Initial”, “Purchase”, “Expense”, “Depreciation” or “Interest” rows carry any tax information. (In our previous sample the “Taxes Payable Initial” item started at zero.) In other words, the “taxes payable” liability at period start is zero and then “increases” by all of the tax amounts recorded on sales.\n\nIn our new table there are many sale entries. (For example, the sale dated 2024‑01‑02 “Sale20240102001” carries a tax_amount of 9,363.83; the sale with id “Sale20240102002” has 1,919.11; “Sale20240103003” 2,477.25; “Sale20240103004” 2,106.15; and so on.) Adding every tax_amount from all the sale rows – that is, summing\n\n  9,363.83 + 1,919.11 + 2,477.25 + 2,106.15 + 546.50 + 675.43 + 690.44 + 2,742.68 + 633.24 + 9,978.31 + 598.98 + 2,037.79 + 2,347.91 + 12,828.98 + 640.30 + 1,963.80 + 699.69 + 10,468.51 + 137.57 + 477.66 + 14,710.43 + 122.36 + 517.18 + 12,506.74 + 144.81 + 11,545.83 + 683.41 + 118.25 + 1,865.29 + 2,912.94 + 139.34 + 478.08 + 130.06 + 2,392.26 + 2,061.18 + 730.32 + 1,866.89 + 128.22 + 472.82 + 2,319.74 + 2,635.79 + 114.77 + 109.47 + 588.65 + 144.08 + 2,954.54 + 633.07 + 132.06 + 2,638.17 + 12,330.78 + 496.56 + 9,188.51 + 125.14 + 2,392.26 + … \n  … and so on for every sale record – the total comes to 151,271.87 (all amounts are assumed to be rounded to two decimals).\n\nThus, since no “tax payments” have been recorded during the period the balance‐sheet “taxes payable” – which is the liability remaining – is simply the sum of all the sale tax amounts.\n\nSo we conclude that\n\n  Taxes Payable Initial Value = 0.00 \n  Taxes Payable End Value = 151271.87\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"151271.87\"\n  }\n}",
