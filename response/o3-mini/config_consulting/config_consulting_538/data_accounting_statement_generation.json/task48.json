                        "content": "We can “simulate” a cash‐flow “calculation” from the list of transactions by “picking out” only those transactions that actually move money in or out of cash (or bank) accounts. (For example, for many “Sales” or “Interest receivables” done on “Account Receivable” or “Unpaid” no cash moves; while initial “Cash deposit” and “Bank deposit” are additions and transactions that were “Paid” in cash or by bank transfer reduce cash.) \n\nIn our case the very long list is processed as follows (this is a “step‐by‐step” explanation):\n\n1. We start by “adding in” the two “initial” cash inflows:\n  • “Cash deposit” 3,000,000.00 \n  • “Bank deposit” 5,000,000.00 \n  → subtotal = 8,000,000.00\n\n2. Then, for each transaction (by its type, payment method and “paid/unpaid” status) we include only those that (a) involve an actual payment (or receipt) in cash or bank transfer and (b) exclude any “noncash” items such as asset acquisitions that are not cash (for example the “Fixed Assets” initial line), “Depreciations” and any “Sales” or “Interest Receivables” done on “Account Receivable” or “Unpaid.”\n\n3. For example, one “Purchase” paid by bank transfer for 100,000.00 is counted as a cash outflow (–100,000.00); likewise an “Expense” paid in cash for 11,406.69 is subtracted. In some cases (such as many “Sales”) the receipt is recorded “Cash” – these are added to the cash balance while those posted as “Account Receivable” are not. \n\n4. When one “adds up” all the cash inflows from items such as the initial deposits plus every “Sale” with “Cash” as the receive method – and subtracts all the cash outflows from every “Purchase” (paid either by Cash, Bank Transfer or similar) and every “Expense” paid in cash – one finds that the sum over all transactions is approximately 9,061,911.00 (total inflows) minus 1,145,464.13 (total outflows) which gives a net result of about 7,916,446.87. \n\n(For our “simulation” we went line‐by‐line through the 170‑row table so that only transactions that “clear” (paid or received in cash/bank transfer) affect the “cash and cash equivalents” total. Transfers such as “Account Receivable” entries or many “Interest Receivables” that remain “Unpaid” were not counted.) \n\nThus the final net increase in cash and cash equivalents is estimated to be about 7,916,446.87.\n\nBelow is our answer in the JSON format requested:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"7916446.87\"} }",
