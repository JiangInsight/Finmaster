                        "content": "We need to determine how much depreciation has accumulated from the beginning of the period up to the latest transaction. In our data the “Depreciation” transactions are the ones that add to the accumulated depreciation account. Notice that there is no beginning‐of‐period accumulated depreciation (fixed assets start with no depreciation), so we start at zero.\n\nStep 1. Determine the beginning (initial) accumulated depreciation value.  \n  Since there is no entry reducing the value of fixed assets by any depreciation prior to 2024, the initial accumulated depreciation is zero.\n\nStep 2. Find the “Depreciation” transactions. In our case there are two:\n  • On 2024‑01‑01 the transaction “Depreciation20240101001” records an amount of 45,752.22.  \n  • On 2024‑02‑01 the transaction “Depreciation20240201002” records an amount of 45,750.84.\n\nStep 3. Sum the depreciation amounts to get the final accumulated depreciation.  \n  Final accumulated depreciation = 45,752.22 + 45,750.84 = 91,503.06\n\nThus, the accumulated depreciation “item” on the balance sheet is zero at the beginning and increases to 91,503.06 by the end of the period.\n\nThe answer in the requested JSON format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"91503.06\"}}",
