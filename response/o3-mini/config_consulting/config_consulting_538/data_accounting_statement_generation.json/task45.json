None of the later transactions indicates a further acquisition or disposal of long‐term fixed assets or investments.\n\nThus, no cash flow entry (apart from the initial balances) arises from investing activities during the period. (Only specific “Fixed Assets Purchase”–style transactions would be included—and here none exists separate from the beginning “Fixed Assets” entry.)\n\nTherefore the net cash flow from investing activities is 0.\n\nThe answer in the required output format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0\"}}",
