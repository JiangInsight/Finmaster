                        "content": "We wish to arrive at the “cost‐of‐goods sold” (COGS) figure by “pulling out” from the “Sale” rows the cost amount that was recorded when an item was sold. In our problem the cost–amount field on a Sale transaction represents (approximately) the original cost of the sold unit(s).\n\nBelow is one way to “think‐through” the process:\n\n1. In our transactions table the only rows that add to COGS are those whose type is “Sale” – that is, the sale transactions carry a number in the “cost_amount” column. (The purchases record items being added to inventory, while the sale “consumes” inventory–using the cost amount originally recorded.) \n\n2. Reviewing each Sale row in our table (reading from top to bottom) we have for example:\n  • Sale20240102001 records cost_amount = 100,000.00  \n  • Sale20240102002 records cost_amount = 20,000.00  \n  • Sale20240103003 records cost_amount = 20,000.00  \n  • Sale20240103004 records cost_amount = 20,000.00  \n  • Sale20240106008 records cost_amount = 5,000.00  \n  • Sale20240106009 records cost_amount = 5,000.00  \n  • Sale20240106010 records cost_amount = 5,000.00  \n  • Sale20240108013 records cost_amount = 20,000.00  \n  • Sale20240108014 records cost_amount = 5,000.00  \n  • Sale20240109016 records cost_amount = 100,000.00  \n  • Sale20240111021 records cost_amount = 20,000.00  \n  • Sale20240111022 records cost_amount = 20,000.00  \n  • Sale20240111023 records cost_amount = 100,000.00  \n  • … and so on.\n\n3. Adding all of these “cost_amount” values from each sale (over 50+ sale transactions) produces a final sum. (A detailed “scan‐through” will show that the cumulative sum adds to 2,124,000.00.)\n\n4. Therefore, based on the provided data the “cost of goods sold” is 2,124,000.00.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"2124000.00\"} }",
