                        "content": "We must “build” the ending balance for receivables from the list of “sale” and “interest‐receivable” transactions that have been recorded as “unpaid” (that is, where the “receive_method” is “Account Receviable” or the record’s type is “Interest Receivables” with “Unpaid” status). (No initial AR is reported in the “Initial” lines.) In our solution we go through the many rows and – after summing up the “after_tax_amount” on all sale transactions that used “Account Receviable” plus the amounts recorded on “Interest Receivables” lines that are unpaid – we obtain a total “final” AR value of about 1,645,435.26. (This “final” figure is the net balance we expect on the balance sheet.) \n\nA short outline of the reasoning follows:\n\n1. In the “Initial” transactions only cash, bank and fixed asset entries are given. (None represent a receivable, so the initial AR balance is zero.)\n\n2. Then every “Sale” record that has its “receive_method” set to “Account Receviable” is “credited” to AR. (For these sales we use the “after_tax_amount”.) Also, every “Interest Receivables” record that is unpaid (with the note “Interest receviable” in the appropriate field) is added to AR.\n\n3. After reading the list row‐by‐row and summing (and even noting that one “Interest” row returned a negative amount [–92.15] and so slightly reduces the overall balance) the total “accounts receivable” that accumulated is about 1,645,435.26.\n\nThus the final answer is as follows:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"1645435.26\"} }\n``` \n\nThis is the step‐by‐step computed answer based on the provided transactions.",
