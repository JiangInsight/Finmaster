                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” the problem as follows. In our example the three “Initial” entries are the starting “balance‐sheet” numbers. In our table these three rows are\n\n  • Cash deposit 3,000,000.00  \n  • Bank deposit 5,000,000.00  \n  • Fixed Assets 5,000,000.00  \n\nso the starting (initial) “liabilities and owners’ equity” balance is\n\n  3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.00\n\nThen throughout January–February 2024 the operating transactions (purchases, expenses, depreciation and sales) ultimately “feed through” into net profit and – together with various items entered on credit – change the closing balance on the liabilities & owners’ equity side. (In a full double‐entry bookkeeping system every sale (with its “profit” column already showing the profit on that sale) is later “netted” against all the expense items – including “depreciation” and even the “interest receivables” are eventually added to operating income.) \n\nA careful (step‐by‐step) summation of the “profit” amounts on the sale lines yields a total sale “profit” of roughly 1,706,447.20; then if one adds the “interest receivables” (which in aggregate run to nearly 14–15 thousands) one obtains “operating income” on the order of 1,721,300. At the same time, all non–cost-of–goods‐sold “Expense” entries (including Sales, Administrative, Financial and Depreciation – which when summed come to about 604,080) reduce the net income. In our rough calculation, the net increase in owners’ equity is\n\n  (1,721,300 (revenues including interest) – 604,080 (expenses)) ≈ 1,117,200\n\nSo adding this net income to the 13,000,000 we began with gives a final “liabilities and owners’ equity” value of roughly\n\n  13,000,000 + 1,117,200 = 14,117,200.00\n\nThus, rounding as required, one may report\n\n  “Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value”: 13,000,000.00  \n  “Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value”: 14,117,200.00\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"14117200.00\"\n  }\n}\n\n────────────────────────────\nNote: (Because each sale transaction already has its “profit” computed and a full summation of all the expense‐type entries and even the “interest receivables” appear on the income statement, one obtains a net change of approximately 1.12 million. Adding that to the initial balance of 13 million gives a close‐approximation of 14.12 million as the closing “liabilities and owners’ equity” value.)",
