                        "content": "We must “build” the accounts receivable balance from all transactions that create receivables. In our data only sales “on account” and “interest receivables” create an AR balance. (Sales made for cash are settled immediately so they do not change AR.) Then the net change in AR over the period is simply the ending balance (assuming the beginning‐of‐period AR was zero) but when “reconciling” cash flows the increase in a noncash asset (AR) is shown as a subtraction (i.e. a decrease in cash) so the number appears as a negative change.\n\nStep 1. Identify the “Sale” transactions that were made on account. (We only include those whose “receive_method” is “Account Receviable”.) In our table these “Sale” rows (together with their reported “after_tax_amount”) are:\n\n • Sale20240102001: 177912.70 \n • Sale20240102002: 36463.17 \n • Sale20240103003: 47067.68 \n • Sale20240103004: 40016.89 \n • Sale20240106009: 12833.08 \n • Sale20240106010: 13118.29 \n • Sale20240108014: 12031.59 \n • Sale20240111022: 44610.36 \n • Sale20240111023: 243750.59 \n • Sale20240112025: 12165.60 \n • Sale20240112026: 37312.19 \n • Sale20240113030: 2613.87 \n • Sale20240113031: 9075.64 \n • Sale20240115034: 2324.86 \n • Sale20240115035: 9826.40 \n • Sale20240115036: 237628.03 \n • Sale20240116039: 2751.48 \n • Sale20240116040: 219370.85 \n • Sale20240117043: 12984.83 \n • Sale20240117044: 2246.78 \n • Sale20240119047: 55345.89 \n • Sale20240120050: 2647.39 \n • Sale20240120051: 9083.51 \n • Sale20240120052: 2471.10 \n • Sale20240121053: 45452.98 \n • Sale20240122056: 39162.42 \n • Sale20240122057: 13876.00 \n • Sale20240124059: 35470.92 \n • Sale20240124060: 2436.26 \n • Sale20240127064: 8983.62 \n • Sale20240127065: 44075.10 \n • Sale20240127066: 50079.94 \n • Sale20240129068: 2079.87 \n • Sale20240130071: 11184.38 \n • Sale20240131075: 56136.21 \n • Sale20240131076: 12028.40 \n • Sale20240201077: 2509.16 \n • Sale20240201078: 50125.19 \n • Sale20240204083: 9434.67 \n • Sale20240205086: 2377.73 \n\nSumming these amounts gives a total of approximately 1,631,065.62.\n\nStep 2. Now include those “Interest Receivables” transactions. In our table every “Interest” row with type “Interest Receivables” “creates” a receivable (with status Unpaid) and the amounts are (see below):\n\n • 430.76  \n • 430.76  \n • 429.425  \n • 420.525  \n • 420.525  \n • 420.525  \n • 416.52  \n • 416.52  \n • 416.52  \n • 412.07  \n • 412.07  \n • 412.07  \n • 412.07  \n • 411.803 (repeated 6 times)  \n • 411.536 (repeated 4 times)  \n • 407.976 (repeated 7+ additional 1 time)  \n • 407.709 (repeated 3 times)  \n • 407.531  \n\nA careful grouping and summing of all 35 such interest lines gives about 14,461.79.\n\nStep 3. The overall ending accounts receivable balance is then the sum of the “sale‐on‐account” balance and the “interest receivables” balance:\n  1,631,065.62 + 14,461.79 ≈ 1,645,527.41.\n\nStep 4. In the cash flow statement (indirect method) an increase in a current asset is shown as a use of cash—so this change is recorded as a negative number. (Assuming that at the beginning of the period AR was zero, the net change is simply the ending balance.)\n\nThus the “(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable” item is –1,645,527.41.\n\nBelow is the final answer in the required JSON format.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-1645527.41\"}}\n```",
