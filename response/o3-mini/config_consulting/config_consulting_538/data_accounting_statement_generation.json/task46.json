That is, the “Cash deposit” is 3,000,000.00 and the “Bank deposit” is 5,000,000.00; although there is an “Initial Fixed Assets” row for 5,000,000.00, it is not part of cash and cash equivalents. When we add the cash and bank deposits we have\n\n  3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 8,000,000.00\n\nThis is therefore the beginning cash and cash equivalents balance.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'}}",
