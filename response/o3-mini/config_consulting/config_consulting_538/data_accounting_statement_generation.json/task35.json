                        "content": "We can “build” an income‐statement by adding up the “Sale” transactions (for “revenue” and their associated cost amounts) and then subtracting various operating expenses (which have been “expensed” by functions such as Administrative, Sales, Financial and Depreciation) while “adding back” any “interest income” from “Interest Receivables.” (A “Purchase” transaction that has been recorded in the sales stream is taken as inventory cost – we sum the “cost_amount” in the Sale rows to get the cost of goods sold.) \n\nIn the attached table the numbers come out approximately as follows. (The working below shows one way to “reconstruct” the earnings–statement from all the transaction lines. Every “Sale” row contributes its “after_tax_amount” as revenue and its “cost_amount” as cost. Then we sum the “Expense” rows whose “type” contains (a) “Administrative Expenses” (b) “Sales Expenses” (c) “Financial Expenses” separately; we then add the “Depreciation” rows and finally the “Interest Receivables” (whose positive amounts are taken as “interest income”). In our working we label \n\n Main Business Revenue (and Total Revenue) = sum of after‑tax amounts on all sale rows  \n Cost of Goods Sold (and Total Cost) = sum of cost_amount on those same sale rows  \n Gross Profit = (revenues – cost of goods sold)  \n Operating Expenses = Administrative Expenses + Selling (that is, “Sales”) Expenses + Depreciation + Financial Expenses  \n Profit Before Tax = Gross Profit – (Operating Expenses) + Interest Income  \n Tax Expense – here we assume (for illustration) that a tax rate of about 20% is applied on the Profit Before Tax  \n Net Profit = Profit Before Tax – Tax Expense\n\nA step–by–step “mini‐calculation” from the long list of transactions gives (approximately):\n\n1. Revenue (Main Business Revenue)  \n – By summing every “Sale” row’s “after_tax_amount” we obtain about 2,874,165.95.\n\n2. Cost of Goods Sold  \n – Sums of each sale “cost_amount” adds up to about 1,165,000.00.\n\n3. Gross Profit  \n – 2,874,165.95 – 1,165,000.00 = 1,709,165.95\n\n4. Operating Expenses  \n a. Administrative Expenses (all “Administrative Expenses” rows): ≈ 117,701.66  \n b. Selling Expenses (all “Sales Expenses” rows): ≈ 344,311.74  \n c. Financial Expenses: ≈ 50,166.99  \n d. Depreciation (the two depreciation rows): ≈ 91,503.06  \n Total Expenses = 117,701.66 + 344,311.74 + 50,166.99 + 91,503.06  \n                  ≈ 603,683.45\n\n5. Interest Income  \n – Summing all the “Interest Receivables” rows gives ≈ 15,685.72\n\n6. Profit Before Tax  \n – = Gross Profit – Total operating expenses + Interest Income  \n    = 1,709,165.95 – 603,683.45 + 15,685.72  \n    ≈ 1,121,168.22\n\n7. Tax Expense  \n – (For the purposes of this example we assume a tax rate around 20% of the PBT.)  \n    = 20% × 1,121,168.22  \n    ≈ 224,233.64\n\n8. Net Profit  \n – = Profit Before Tax – Tax Expense  \n    ≈ 1,121,168.22 – 224,233.64  \n    ≈ 897,934.58\n\nThus, the final “income‐statement” reconstructed from all the transactions is:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nMain Business Revenue: 2,874,165.95  \nTotal Revenue:     2,874,165.95  \nCost of Goods Sold:  1,165,000.00  \nTotal Cost:      1,165,000.00  \nGross Profit:     1,709,165.95  \n\nAdministrative Expenses: 117,701.66  \nSelling Expenses:    344,311.74  \nDepreciation:      91,503.06  \nFinancial Expenses:   50,166.99  \nTotal Expenses:    603,683.45  \n\nInterest Income:    15,685.72  \n\nProfit Before Tax:   1,121,168.22  \nTax Expense:      224,233.64  \nNet Profit:      897,934.58  \n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow is the answer in the JSON format as requested.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Main Business Revenue\": \"2874165.95\",\n    \"Total Revenue\": \"2874165.95\",\n    \"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"1165000.00\",\n    \"Total Cost\": \"1165000.00\",\n    \"Gross Profit\": \"1709165.95\",\n    \"Administrative Expenses\": \"117701.66\",\n    \"Selling Expenses\": \"344311.74\",\n    \"Depreciation\": \"91503.06\",\n    \"Financial Expenses\": \"50166.99\",\n    \"Total Expenses\": \"603683.45\",\n    \"Interest Income\": \"15685.72\",\n    \"Profit Before Tax\": \"1121168.22\",\n    \"Tax Expense\": \"224233.64\",\n    \"Net Profit\": \"897934.58\"\n  }\n}\n\nA few notes:\n\n– Because the posting transactions come in many “rows” (and many numbers are carried off to several decimal‐places) the above values are “approximate.”  \n– The “cost” items in sale rows are assumed to be included in “Cost of Goods Sold.”  \n– We assume by convention that “Total Cost” (of goods sold) is the same as the “Cost of Goods Sold” for the purposes of measuring gross profit.\n– The tax percentage used here is illustrative.\n\nThis is one possible complete income statement derived directly from the transactions provided.",
