                        "content": "We can “build” the company’s income‐statement by “summing” the profit items that appear on the revenue (sales and interest income) side and then “subtracting” the operating expense items (all “Expense” and “Depreciation” transactions). (Note that the “Purchase”, “Initial” and “Transfer” transactions affect balance‐sheet accounts and are not part of the income–statement.) One may “read” each row that has a “Sale” type (which already includes a “profit” column) and each “Interest Receivables” row (which record interest income) – then separately “sum” all “Expense” rows (including Financial, Administrative, Sales expenses) as well as “Depreciation” rows (treated as an expense).\n\nIn our very long list the process went roughly like this (we show a summary outline of the work):\n\n1. For every “Sale” row we extracted its “profit” amount. For example, one sale had profit 87,276.53, another 18,382.28, then others such as 29,544.93, 22,123.04, … etc. Adding up across all “Sale” rows we obtained a total of about 1,560,890.94.\n\n2. For every “Interest Receivables” row (which occur on several dates) we added up its “amount” (for example, 430.76, 430.76, 429.425, 420.525, … etc.) and obtained an interest income total of about 14,054.17.\n\n3. Then we summed up the “Expense” rows (which include all types labeled “Administrative Expenses”, “Sales Expenses”, “Financial Expenses”) plus the “Depreciation” row. (We ignore any “Purchase” these are not in the income‐statement.) This total came to about 583,782.51.\n\nFinally the net profit is computed as follows:\n\n  Net Profit = (Total Sale profit + Total Interest Income) – (Total Expenses + Depreciation)\n\n         ≈ (1,560,890.94 + 14,054.17) – 583,782.51\n         ≈ 1,574,945.11 – 583,782.51 \n         ≈ 991,162.60\n\nThus, based on the given transactions the final net profit is approximately 991,162.60.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"991162.60\"}}",
