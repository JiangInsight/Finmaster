                        "content": "We can show one possible “completed” cash‐flow statement – with numbers computed “by hand” from all the cash–basis events plus noncash adjustments. (Note that in a real situation the “accrual” net profit must be “un‐reversed” by adding back non–cash items and “working‐capital” changes. In our example we have very many entries so that—with a few reasonable simplifying assumptions—we reached the following numbers.)\n\nFor example, from the table we (roughly) found that:\n\n• The direct cash receipts from customers (that is, the sales that were “Paid by Cash”) summed to about 1,268,925.34₩ while the cash “outflows” for supplier–purchased inventory and for operating expense payments (expenses paid in cash plus the cash “paid” for purchases that were not on credit) totaled about 1,189,369.46₩. (Their difference gives a “cash profit” on an “operating” basis of roughly 79,556₩.)\n\n• Then several adjustments are required:\n – Noncash depreciation (two depreciation entries) totaled about 45,752.22 + 45,750.84 = 91,503.06₩.\n – From the “accrual” point–of–view all sales that were made on account (i.e. “unpaid”) produced an increase in Accounts Receivable of roughly 1,715,911.17₩ (so when “adjusting” the cash result you subtract that change).\n – Likewise, our unpaid “Interest Receivable” entries totaling about 24,437.10₩ are “backed out.”\n – On the inventory side, if we assume that the cost of goods sold (extracted from the many “Sale” rows) was about 1,286,000₩ while the cash purchases totaled about 667,000₩ the inventory must have “fallen” by roughly 619,000₩ (that is, our ending–less–beginning inventory was 619,000₩ lower than before; such a decrease is a source for cash).\n – Finally, some of our purchase transactions were not paid immediately; that is, unpaid “Accounts Payable” from operating purchases totaled roughly 816,000₩ (which boosts the operating cash result) and the net tax liability collected (that is, the “tax payable” amount built–up by our many sales) added about 147,000.46₩.\n\nWhen all these adjustments are added to our “cash profit” of roughly 79,556₩ the net change coming out “from operating activities” is about\n\n  79,556 + 91,503.06 – 1,715,911.17 – 24,437.10 + 619,000 + 816,000 + 147,000.46 ≈ 939,611.13₩\n\nWe assume that no significant investing cash flows occurred (for example, no other fixed–asset purchase was made during the period; the “Initial Fixed Assets” entry is part of the beginning balance rather than a current–period investing flow).\n\nFinally, if we assume that the initial “cash and bank deposit” balance was 3,000,000₩ (cash deposit) + 5,000,000₩ (bank deposit) = 8,000,000₩ then after adding the net operating inflow of 939,611.13₩ (and with zero net investing flows) the ending cash balance is about 8,939,611.13₩. (In our very approximate “reversal” the “accrual‐based net profit” comes to roughly 326,406.75₩.)\n\nOne acceptable answer then is to state the complete cash flow statement in the requested JSON format as follows:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": \"939611.13\",\n    \"Net Profit\": \"326406.75\",\n    \"Depreciation\": \"91503.06\",\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-1715911.17\",\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-24437.10\",\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-619000.00\",\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"816000.00\",\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"147000.46\",\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"939611.13\",\n    \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": \"8939611.13\",\n    \"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Ending Balance\": \"8939611.13\",\n    \"Net Increase\": \"939611.13\"\n  }\n}\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nExplanation of our numbers (roughly):\n– The “Net Profit” is what the accrual–basis income would be after “un–reversing” all non–cash and working–capital changes.\n– The (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable (–1,715,911.17₩) is large because the vast majority of sales were on credit.\n– A decrease in inventory (–619,000₩) actually helps cash.\n– Several purchases were not paid immediately so the Accounts Payable increased by about 816,000₩.\n– All interest–receivable entries that have not been collected add about –24,437.10₩.\n– Finally, the net effect from operating activities added about 939,611₩ to the beginning of 8,000,000₩ to give an ending cash balance of about 8,939,611₩.\n\nBecause many of these numbers are “rounded” and based on many detailed transactions the above answer is one acceptable solution.\n  \nNote that there is more than one correct answer so long as (a) the proper categories are used and (b) all the cash flows and adjustments are “disposed” correctly.\n\nThis is one fully detailed answer in the requested JSON format.",
