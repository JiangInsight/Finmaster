                        "content": "We only want to report any cash‐outflow entry that “bought” fixed assets (for example a “Fixed Assets Purchase” transaction) so that in the investing section the cash payment for “purchase of fixed assets” appears. In the example the only row that made such an entry was a “Fixed Assets Purchase” row (with amount 305354.43). \n\nIn the table provided in the problem the first three rows are “Initial” entries (cash deposit, bank deposit, and fixed assets) that “set up” the opening balances. The “Fixed Assets” row shows 5000000.0 but that is an opening (“initial”) balance and not a current‐period cash outflow for an acquisition. All of the subsequent “Purchase” rows have details for items such as consulting or IT solutions – they are not recorded as fixed asset acquisitions. (They even do not include any information – like an asset name or asset type – that would indicate these were “fixed asset” transactions.) \n\nThus, there is no separate non‑initial “purchase of fixed assets” entry recorded using cash during the period. In other words, no new fixed asset purchase (aside from the prior period’s opening balance) was made which would appear as a cash outflow.\n\nTherefore the “final purchase of fixed assets” in the cash flow statement for the period is 0. \n\nThe answer (presented in the required json format) is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"0\"\n  }\n}",
