                        "content": "We must “build” the accounts‐payable line by adding up the “credit purchases” – that is, only the Purchase transactions that have not been paid (actually being “unpaid” and using the “Account Payable” payment method). (When a purchase is paid by another method – say “Bank Transfer” or “Cash” – it is paid immediately and does not leave a liability.) \n\nLooking carefully at the data (only the rows whose “type” is Purchase and whose “payment/receipt_status” is Unpaid and “payment_method” is “Account Payable”) we find the following rows (with their “amount” values):\n\n• Purchase20231231006: 100000.0  \n• Purchase20231231010: 300000.0  \n• Purchase20231231013: 1000.0  \n• Purchase20231231014: 15000.0  \n• Purchase20231231018: 60000.0  \n• Purchase20231231024: 20000.0  \n• Purchase20231231025: 5000.0  \n• Purchase20231231026: 300000.0  \n• Purchase20231231029: 15000.0  \n\nWe now add these amounts step‐by‐step:\n  100000.0 + 300000.0 = 400000.0  \n  400000.0 + 1000.0 = 401000.0  \n  401000.0 + 15000.0 = 416000.0  \n  416000.0 + 60000.0 = 476000.0  \n  476000.0 + 20000.0 = 496000.0  \n  496000.0 + 5000.0 = 501000.0  \n  501000.0 + 300000.0 = 801000.0  \n  801000.0 + 15000.0 = 816000.0  \n\nThere are no offsets (that is, no “paid” transactions that specifically reduce an outstanding accounts payable balance – all such purchases are recorded only when they are “unpaid”).\n\nThus the net (increase in) accounts payable is 816,000.00.\n\nBelow is the answer as required:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"816000.00\"}}\n```",
