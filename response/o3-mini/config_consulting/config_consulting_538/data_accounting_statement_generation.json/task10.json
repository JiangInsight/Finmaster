In our data the only non‐current asset opening balance is recorded as a “Fixed Assets” transaction with an amount of 5,000,000.00. (Other initial items such as cash or bank deposits are not part of property, plant and equipment.)\n\nThroughout the period, the non‐current asset balance is adjusted mainly through “Depreciation” entries (capital expenditures would normally add to fixed assets but no clearly identified fixed asset purchase occurs in these records). In our data we see two depreciation transactions:\n\n• Depreciation20240101001 dated 2024‑01‑01 for 45,752.22  \n• Depreciation20240201002 dated 2024‑02‑01 for 45,750.84\n\nThe total depreciation taken during the period is:\n\n  45,752.22 + 45,750.84 = 91,503.06\n\nNo additional “fixed asset‐type” purchases appear among the “Purchase” entries (many of those purchased items are ordinary operating transactions) so we assume no capital additions to the fixed assets item.\n\nThus, the end-of‐period (“non-current assets”) balance is calculated as:\n\n  Initial Fixed Assets – Total Depreciation  \n  = 5,000,000.00 – 91,503.06  \n  = 4,908,496.94\n\nWe then report the results in the required format.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"4908496.94\"\n  }\n}",
