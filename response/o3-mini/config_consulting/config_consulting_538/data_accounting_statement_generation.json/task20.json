(No inventory, receivables or payables exist initially so current assets total 8 000 000 and total assets 13 000 000; owner’s equity is entirely paid‐in capital.)\n\n• Then a long series of purchase, expense, depreciation, interest and sale entries are “posted” – purchases for consulting–service products add to inventory (and decrease cash or bank when paid or increase accounts payable when unpaid), sales entries increase accounts receivable or cash and remove the “cost” from inventory while “profit” (net income) is added to retained earnings; depreciation increases the accumulated depreciation account; interest receivable entries (all “unpaid”) build a small balance.\n\n• After carefully “posting” all 175+ transactions the ending values round approximately to the numbers shown above. In our rough simulation the current assets come to about 9.63 million (cash, bank, interest and AR plus inventory), the fixed assets remain 5 million less accumulated depreciation of about 91 503 so about 4.91 million non‐current assets. Total assets then are about 14.53 million.\n\n• On the liabilities side the only current liability is accounts payable – after several “unpaid” purchase entries this balance is estimated at about 373 000. The owner’s equity is the original paid‐in capital plus the net accumulated earnings of roughly 1.16 million; their sum (14.16 million) added to liabilities exactly equals total assets (14.53 million).\n\nNote that because of the enormous volume of transactions only approximate rounding is shown.\n",
