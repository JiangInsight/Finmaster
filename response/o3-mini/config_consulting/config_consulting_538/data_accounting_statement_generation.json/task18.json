In our table the three “Initial” rows are\n\n• Cash deposit = 3,000,000  \n• Bank deposit = 5,000,000  \n• Fixed Assets = 5,000,000  \n\nwhich sum to an initial owners equity of\n\n  3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.00\n\nAll later non‐initial entries do not “directly” change the “capital” account but show the operating results (the “profit” on sales and also the “expense” and “depreciation” entries, plus interest income from “Interest Receivables”). (Purchases – for example buying inventory – affect asset values rather than profit immediately; here only the “profit” fields on the Sale rows already capture the margin on each sale.) \n\nTo “close” the period we must compute net profit. In our “transaction” table each Sale row has a “profit” value. For the 52 sale transactions the sum of the “profit” column is about\n\n  1,706,458.20\n\n(in addition, there are many “Interest Receivable” entries – they are recorded income even though they may not yet be collected – whose sum comes to about 14,869.76).\n\nThen we must subtract operating costs that were explicitly recorded as “Expense” and “Depreciation.” If we add in all the expense entries (whether for Administrative, Sales, Financial, etc.) the sum is about\n\n  505,659.15\n\nand the single depreciation row is\n\n  45,752.22.\n\nThus, the “total expenses” that reduce profit are\n\n  505,659.15 + 45,752.22 ≈ 551,411.37\n\nSo our operating net result (net profit) is computed as\n\n  (net sales profit + interest income) – (expenses + depreciation)\n  ≈ (1,706,458.20 + 14,869.76) – 551,411.37 \n  ≈ 1,721,327.96 – 551,411.37 \n  ≈ 1,169,916.59\n\nThis net profit is then “closed‐into” owners’ equity so that\n\n  Final Owners’ Equity ≈ 13,000,000.00 + 1,169,916.59 = 14,169,916.59\n\nThus our answer is:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"14169916.59\"} }",
