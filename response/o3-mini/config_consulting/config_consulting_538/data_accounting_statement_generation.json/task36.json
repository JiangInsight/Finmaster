                        "content": "We first “filter‐out” those transactions that affect profit. In our simplified method we “ignore” the opening capital items and the transactions that simply record purchases or fixed asset acquisitions. (These affect the balance sheet but not “profit‐and‐loss” directly.) Then we add together (a) the profit “on sale” transactions and any “interest receivable” revenue and then subtract (b) the “expense” amounts and the “depreciation” expense.\n\nIn our case we go through the large list “line‐by‐line”. For example (note: all numbers below are taken from the “amount” fields in the appropriate columns):\n\n1. Sales – each “Sale” row carries an already–computed “profit” value. Adding these for all sale rows we obtain about 1,713,437.82.\n2. Interest – several “Interest Receivables” lines appear. Their amounts (when summed) add roughly to 15,277.74.\n3. Expenses – every “Expense” (whether “Administrative Expenses”, “Sales Expenses”, or “Financial Expenses”) is summed. Their total comes to about 522,269.46.\n4. Depreciation – the two depreciation transactions add to about 91,503.06.\n\nThen we compute\n\n  Net Profit = (Sales profit + Interest income) – (Expenses + Depreciation)\n          = (1,713,437.82 + 15,277.74) – (522,269.46 + 91,503.06)\n          = 1,728,715.56 – 613,772.52\n          ≈ 1,114,943.04\n\nThus the final net profit is about 1,114,943.04.\n\nThe answer is then returned in the JSON format as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Profit\": \"1114943.04\"\n  }\n}\n\n(Notice that the computation is “approximately” done step‐by‐step based on the provided data.)",
