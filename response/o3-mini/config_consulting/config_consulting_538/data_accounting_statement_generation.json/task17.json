                        "content": "We can “build” a simple net‐income figure out of the entries that affect operating result. (In these transaction tables the “Initial” items represent contributed capital and fixed assets so they are not “profit‐related.” Also “Purchase” entries are “capitalized” or “inventoried” so they do not enter the current‐period P&L.) One common method is to “sum up” the impact from the “Sale” and “Interest” transactions (each sale row already comes with a “profit” – already netting out its cost of goods) and then subtract all “Expense”–type charges (including operating “Expenses” such as Sales, Administrative and Financial, plus noncash Depreciation). (For our purposes we assume that all amounts are already “net” and that no further tax adjustments are needed.) \n\nIn our given table the key figures are as follows (all amounts in “currency units”):\n\n1. Total profit from all “Sale” lines  \n  • We add up the “profit” field on every Sale transaction. When you add all the Sale–profits you get approximately 1,561,890.94.\n\n2. Total “interest income” is provided by the “Interest Receivables” rows. Adding all those numbers (many being roughly 400–430 each) yields about 15,686.25.\n\n3. Total “expenses” from all the listed Expense–type transactions (Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Financial Expenses, etc.) sum roughly to 517,042.84. In addition, the two Depreciation transactions (one on 2024‐01‐01 and one on 2024‐02‐01) add 45,752.22 + 45,750.84 = 91,503.06. (Note that Purchase entries and the Initial deposit rows are not “flow” items for income.)  \n  Thus total charges (expenses plus depreciation) come to about 608,545.90.\n\nThen we have:\n\n  Total “operating revenue” = (Sum of Sale–profits + Sum of Interest income)  \n    ≈ 1,561,890.94 + 15,686.25 = 1,577,577.19\n\nSubtracting the total expenses gives a net (operating) profit:\n\n  Net Income = 1,577,577.19 – 608,545.90 ≈ 969,031.29\n\nFor the beginning balance we assume that the “Retained Earnings” started from zero. (That is, the “Initial” transactions represent the owner’s contributed capital while the profit/loss activity for the period is “retained” in that balance.)\n\nThus the “Retained Earnings” items become:\n\n  Retained Earnings Initial Value = 0.00  \n  Retained Earnings End Value = 969,031.29  \n\nBelow is our JSON answer:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"969031.29\"\n  }\n}\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n(This answer is obtained by “summing‐up” all the profit–related inflows – the Sale profit figures plus Interest income – then subtracting all expense outflows (expenses plus depreciation).)",
