                        "content": "We need to “build” our balance‐sheet “liability” figure from the transactions that have “unpaid” purchase obligations (that is, when the company hasn’t paid for a purchase yet, the amount is recorded as a liability). (Note that the “Initial…” lines set up only assets; also note that “Interest receivables” and “Sales” that are “unpaid” normally become receivables – an asset – not a liability.) \n\nStep 1. Look at the “Initial…” rows. In our table there are three “Initial20231231001” rows (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets). None of these contribute to liabilities. So the liability opening (initial) value is zero.\n\nStep 2. Now scan all transactions whose type is “Purchase” (or that otherwise use the “Account Payable” payment method) and whose “payment/receipt_status” is “Unpaid”. In our table the Purchase rows are as follows:\n\n• Purchase20231231001 – “Paid” → already paid (no liability)  \n• Purchase20231231002 – “Paid” → not a liability  \n• Purchase20231231003 – “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231004 – “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231005 – “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231006 – Unpaid (payment method “Account Payable”) → amount 100,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231007 – “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231008 – “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231009 – “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231010 – Unpaid (payment method “Account Payable”) → amount 300,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231011 – “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231012 – “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231013 – Unpaid (“Unpaid”; also the payment method is not cash so it is recorded as a payable) → amount 1,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231014 – Unpaid → amount 15,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231015 – “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231016 – “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231017 – “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231018 – Unpaid → amount 60,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231019 – “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231020 – “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231021 – “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231022 – “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231023 – “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231024 – Unpaid → amount 20,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231025 – Unpaid → amount 5,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231026 – Unpaid → amount 300,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231027 – “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231028 – “Paid”  \n• Purchase20231231029 – Unpaid → amount 15,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231030 – “Paid”\n\nStep 3. Sum only the unpaid purchase amounts (which are recorded as “Account Payable” – a liability):\n\n  100,000.0  \n+ 300,000.0  \n+ 1,000.0  \n+ 15,000.0  \n+ 60,000.0  \n+ 20,000.0  \n+ 5,000.0  \n+ 300,000.0  \n+ 15,000.0  \n————————————  \n  = 816,000.0\n\nThis total of 816,000.0 is the “total liabilities at period end.”\n\nThus our answer is:\n\n{\n  \"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"816000.00\"\n}\n\nPresenting the answer in the required json format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"816000.00\"\n  }\n}",
