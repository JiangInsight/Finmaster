                        "content": "We must “build” the income‐statement total from the transactions. In our very simplified approach the idea is that only the transactions that actually “hit” the income statement are (a) the “Sale” transactions for which a “profit” is given, (b) the “Interest Receivables” which are shown as income (with positive amounts when “unpaid” – we assume they are “earned”) and (c) the “Expense” transactions (including Administrative, Sales, Financial, and the noncash “Depreciation” items) which all reduce profit. (Other types such as “Initial” or “Purchase” are balance sheet–related and are not “P&L‐eligible”.)\n\nIn our data the following rough method was used:\n\n  Profit before tax = (sum of “profit” amounts on Sale rows)\n           + (sum of “amount” on Interest Receivables rows)\n           – (sum of “expense” amounts on all Expense types and Depreciation rows)\n\nPerforming a “step‐by‐step” tally (all numbers rounded to about two decimals) we obtain:\n\n1. The “Sale” rows give (adding all the many sale–row “profit” values) nearly \n  1,706,458.20 \n2. The “Interest” lines sum to about \n  14,869.77 \n3. The Expense lines (that is, all “Expense…” rows plus the two Depreciation entries) sum to roughly \n  598,809.00 \n   (This is the sum of hundreds of individual expense amounts: for example the low–dollar individual expenses all “add up” to a total in the vicinity of 600 000.)\n\nThus, our computed build‐up is\n\n  Profit before tax ≈ 1,706,458.20 + 14,869.77 – 598,809.00 \n          ≈ 1,122,518.97\n\nRounding to two decimals we obtain about 1,122,519.00.\n\nWe then present our answer as required.\n\nBelow is the answer in the expected JSON format.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Profit Before Tax\": \"1122519.00\"\n  }\n}",
