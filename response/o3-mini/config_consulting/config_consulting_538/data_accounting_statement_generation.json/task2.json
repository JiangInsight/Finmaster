                        "content": "We first note that the “Bank deposit” account is “seeded” with an initial deposit of 5,000,000.00 on 2023‑12‑31 (see the “Initial20231231001” row with type “Bank deposit”). Then, throughout the period many transactions use bank‐transfer payments – these are the only ones that affect the bank deposit account (because cash‐payments or “Account Receivable” entries are handled in other accounts).\n\nStep 1. Identify the bank–related outflows (only those rows whose “payment_method” is “Bank Transfer” and where the transaction is “Paid” – “Unpaid” ones have not yet affected the bank account):\n\n• Purchase20231231001 – Purchase paid by Bank Transfer for 100,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231002 – Purchase paid by Bank Transfer for 60,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231003 – Purchase paid by Bank Transfer for 15,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231005 – Purchase paid by Bank Transfer for 100,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231007 – Purchase paid by Bank Transfer for 5,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231008 – Purchase paid by Bank Transfer for 40,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231011 – Purchase paid by Bank Transfer for 10,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231012 – Purchase paid by Bank Transfer for 40,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231015 – Purchase paid by Bank Transfer for 3,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231020 – Purchase paid by Bank Transfer for 3,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231028 – Purchase paid by Bank Transfer for 3,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231030 – Purchase paid by Bank Transfer for 2,000.00\n\nStep 2. Sum these amounts:\n\n• 100,000.00 + 60,000.00 = 160,000.00  \n• 160,000.00 + 15,000.00 = 175,000.00  \n• 175,000.00 + 100,000.00 = 275,000.00  \n• 275,000.00 + 5,000.00 = 280,000.00  \n• 280,000.00 + 40,000.00 = 320,000.00  \n• 320,000.00 + 10,000.00 = 330,000.00  \n• 330,000.00 + 40,000.00 = 370,000.00  \n• 370,000.00 + 3,000.00 = 373,000.00  \n• 373,000.00 + 3,000.00 = 376,000.00  \n• 376,000.00 + 3,000.00 = 379,000.00  \n• 379,000.00 + 2,000.00 = 381,000.00\n\nThus the total “bank‐transfer” (bank outflow) is 381,000.00.\n\nStep 3. Compute the end value of the bank deposit by taking the initial bank deposit and subtracting the bank‑transfer outflows:\n\n  Final Bank Deposit = 5,000,000.00 – 381,000.00 = 4,619,000.00\n\nThus, our final results are:\n\n• Bank Deposits Initial Value: 5,000,000.00  \n• Bank Deposits End Value: 4,619,000.00\n\nWe now present the answer in the requested json format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"4619000.00\"} }",
