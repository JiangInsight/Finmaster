Although the balance sheet shows the inventory balance at period end and the cash flow statement shows the change (decrease) in inventory, the “carrying amount of inventories sold” is reported on the income statement as the Cost of Goods Sold. In the provided financial statement, that line item (and its value) is:\n\n  Cost of Goods Sold  1312000.00\n\nTherefore, the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is 1312000.00.\n\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1312000.00'}}",
