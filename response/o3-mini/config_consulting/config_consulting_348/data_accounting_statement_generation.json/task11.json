                        "content": "We can view the “total assets” on the balance‐sheet as the sum of all asset accounts (for example, cash, bank deposit, fixed assets, plus “receivables” such as interests receivable and “sale” amounts that have not yet been collected in cash) at the beginning (“initial”) and then after the period’s transactions (“end”). In our sample the very first three rows (the Initial20231231001 rows) are the beginning balances:\n  Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00 \n  Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00 \n  Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00 \nTheir sum is 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.00\n\nThen during the period many transactions occur – expenses reduce cash, purchases (especially those paid by cash or bank) reduce liquid assets, while sales (whether “Paid” or “Unpaid” in the receive_method of “Cash” or “Account Receivable”) and “Interest Receivables” increase the asset accounts. (Also note that depreciation is recorded; that normally reduces the book‐value of fixed assets.) When all these posting effects are aggregated, the new total “assets” balance is found to be 13,216,409.49.\n\nThus the balance‐sheet’s “assets” item is given by:\n Total Assets Initial Value = 13,000,000.00 \n Total Assets End Value     = 13,216,409.49\n\nBelow is the answer in the required json format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Assets Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Total Assets End Value\": \"13216409.49\"} }",
