                        "content": "We must “build” the current accounts‐payable “balance” by adding up only those purchase transactions that used “Account Payable” as the payment method and whose payment/receipt status is Unpaid. (Any “Initial” row is a seed transaction that does not carry an AP balance.) Let’s check the transactions that meet the criteria:\n\n• Purchase20231231001 – Type “Purchase” with amount = 60,000.0, Unpaid and Payment method “Account Payable”\n• Purchase20231231006 – amount = 60,000.0, Unpaid, Payment method “Account Payable”\n• Purchase20231231007 – amount = 10,000.0, Unpaid, Payment method “Account Payable”\n• Purchase20231231011 – amount = 300,000.0, Unpaid, Payment method “Account Payable”\n• Purchase20231231014 – amount = 2,000.0, Unpaid, Payment method “Account Payable”\n• Purchase20231231016 – amount = 40,000.0, Unpaid, Payment method “Account Payable”\n• Purchase20231231021 – amount = 3,000.0, Unpaid, Payment method “Account Payable”\n• Purchase20231231022 – amount = 10,000.0, Unpaid, Payment method “Account Payable”\n\nNow we add them:\n 60,000.0 + 60,000.0 = 120,000.0  \n 120,000.0 + 10,000.0 = 130,000.0  \n 130,000.0 + 300,000.0 = 430,000.0  \n 430,000.0 + 2,000.0 = 432,000.0  \n 432,000.0 + 40,000.0 = 472,000.0  \n 472,000.0 + 3,000.0 = 475,000.0  \n 475,000.0 + 10,000.0 = 485,000.0\n\nSince no initial “AP‐“ balance is provided in the “Initial20231231001” transactions the beginning value is zero.\n\nTherefore, the accounts payable item in the balance sheet is:\n Initial value: 0.00  \n Final (end) value: 485000.00\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"485000.00\"}}",
