                        "content": "We have to “extract” only those cash‐flow transactions that represent acquisitions of long‐term (fixed) assets during the period. (In a complete cash flow statement the “purchase of fixed assets” is the cash outlay during the period for new property, plant and equipment.) In the sample data a special “Fixed Assets Purchase” transaction was recorded (with an amount of 305354.43) and that was taken as the purchase of fixed assets amount.\n\nLook now at the new data. The opening (“Initial…”) transactions include three rows:\n• A “Cash deposit” of 3000000.0\n• A “Bank deposit” of 5000000.0\n• A “Fixed Assets” row of 5000000.0\n\nThese “Initial…” rows record the starting balances (cash and fixed assets) set up on 2023‑12‑31. The cash‐flow statement shows changes (i.e. cash flows during the period). (For example, even though the “Fixed Assets” balance is 5000000.0 at inception, that is an opening balance – not a “new purchase” during the current period.)\n\nAll the remaining transactions in the list are either Sales, Purchases (of inventory, consulting services, etc.), Expenses, Depreciation or Interest entries. None of these later transactions are of the type that indicate a purchase of fixed assets (such as a “Fixed Assets Purchase” transaction).\n\nThus – after excluding the initial “Fixed Assets” entry (which is not a new purchase made during the period) – there is no cash outlay recorded in the period under a fixed asset purchase heading.\n\nTherefore the final purchase of fixed assets for the period is 0.\n\nThe answer in the required json format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '0'}\n}",
