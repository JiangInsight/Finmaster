In our sample problem the first “Initial20231231001” entry with type “Fixed Assets” shows an initial amount of 5,000,000.00. Unlike other kinds of transactions (purchases, expenses, depreciation, etc.) which affect cash, expense or accumulated depreciation accounts, the fixed‐asset item on the balance sheet is usually reported at its “gross” (or “historical”) amount. (In the example provided the additional fixed asset purchase of 305,354.43 was added to the initial 5,000,000.00 to yield a final Fixed Assets value of 5,305,354.43.) \n\nIn the table for the problem to solve the only fixed asset–related entry is the “Fixed Assets” row (id “Initial20231231001”, amount = 5,000,000.0) and no additional fixed assets purchase is recorded. (Other entries such as the “Depreciation” transaction are recorded separately and do not reduce the gross asset value reported on the balance sheet.) \n\nTherefore:\n• Fixed Assets Initial Value = 5,000,000.00 \n• Fixed Assets End Value = 5,000,000.00\n\nThe answer is provided below in the specified json format. \n\n----------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"5000000.00\"\n  }\n}",
