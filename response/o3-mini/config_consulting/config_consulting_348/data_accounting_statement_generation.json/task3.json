                        "content": "We can “build” an inventory account from the transactions that include (a) purchases (which add items to inventory) and (b) sales (which remove items at cost) – ignoring the “initial” rows that are cash, bank or fixed‐assets (which do not count as inventory). In our “problem to solve” table the only beginning “initial” entries (with id starting “Initial…”) do not include inventory so we take the beginning inventory as zero. Then we add up the cost of every purchase transaction (using the “cost_per_unit” × “quantity”) and subtract from that the cost of goods sold recorded on each sale (the “cost_amount” field).\n\nStep–by–step:\n\n1. Identify “Purchase” rows. In our table these are the rows whose type begins with “Purchase…” (for example, Purchase20231231001, Purchase20231231002, …, Purchase20231231023). For each row we compute:\n  item purchase cost = cost_per_unit × quantity\n Then sum over all purchase transactions. (A careful read of the table gives:  \n  • Purchase20231231001: 3×20,000 = 60,000  \n  • Purchase20231231002: 1×100,000 = 100,000  \n  • Purchase20231231003: 3×1,000 = 3,000  \n  • Purchase20231231004: 1×5,000 = 5,000  \n  • Purchase20231231005: 3×5,000 = 15,000  \n  • Purchase20231231006: 3×20,000 = 60,000  \n  • Purchase20231231007: 3×100,000 = 300,000  \n  • Purchase20231231008: 3×100,000 = 300,000  \n  • Purchase20231231009: 1×20,000 = 20,000  \n  • Purchase20231231010: 1×5,000 = 5,000  \n  • Purchase20231231011: 3×100,000 = 300,000  \n  • Purchase20231231012: 3×5,000 = 15,000  \n  • Purchase20231231013: 2×100,000 = 200,000  \n  • Purchase20231231014: 2×1,000 = 2,000  \n  • Purchase20231231015: 3×1,000 = 3,000  \n  • Purchase20231231016: 2×20,000 = 40,000  \n  • Purchase20231231017: 2×5,000 = 10,000  \n  • Purchase20231231018: 3×5,000 = 15,000  \n  • Purchase20231231019: 3×20,000 = 60,000  \n  • Purchase20231231020: 1×20,000 = 20,000  \n  • Purchase20231231021: 3×1,000 = 3,000  \n  • Purchase20231231022: 2×5,000 = 10,000  \n  • Purchase20231231023: 3×20,000 = 60,000  \n When summed the total purchase cost comes to 1,606,000.)\n\n2. Identify “Sale” rows. For those the “cost_amount” field indicates by how much the inventory is reduced. (Again, reading the table we simply sum the “cost_amount” on every sale row. When we add up all the cost_amount values appearing on sales we obtain a total cost “sold” of 1,204,000.)\n\n3. Then the change in inventory is:  \n  Ending Inventory = Beginning Inventory (0) + Total Purchases (1,606,000) – Cost of Goods Sold (1,204,000) = 402,000.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nInventory Initial Value = 0.00  \nInventory End Value = 402000.00\n\nPresenting our answer in json as required:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Inventory End Value\": \"402000.00\"} }",
