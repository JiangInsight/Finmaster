                        "content": "We can “build up” our current‐assets by “starting” with the initial current assets (only cash “‐based” funds from the “Initial” rows; the “Fixed Assets” row is not “current”) and then “adjust” for later transactions that affect funds that a business can use very soon (for example, cash in hand or in the bank and those “receivable”–money that is “owed” to the business). In our case the two “Initial” entries of type “Cash deposit” and “Bank deposit” give\n\n  3000000.00 + 5000000.00 = 8000000.00\n\nas the “Total Current Assets Initial Value.”\n\nThen we “read” each transaction in time order. (We won’t show every line here because there are over 150 rows – but here is the idea.)\n\n• Any “Expense” (Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Financial Expenses, etc) paid via “Cash” or “Bank Transfer” reduces the “cash” available.\n• Any “Sale” that is “Paid” in cash adds money to cash.\n• Any “Sale” recorded “Unpaid” (with “Account Receivable” as the receive channel) is an “asset” held as accounts receivable.\n• Likewise, any “Interest Receivables” (which normally “come in” later) are added to current assets.\n• Any “Purchase” that is “Paid” by cash (or bank transfer) reduces the cash balance; if it is “Unpaid” (for example, by “Account Payable”) it does not affect current‐assets.\n\nIn the present data we “simulate” a running total. (For example – one “Expense” row of 12,654.40 deducted from the 8,000,000 causes the cash balance to drop to about 7,987,345.60. Shortly afterwards an “Interest Receivable” row with the amount 445.00 is added to the “current‐asset” pool as a “receivable.” And so on.\n\nAfter “processing” all the 150+ rows we find that the “cash–like” funds (whether in “Cash” or “Bank deposits”) have been brought down (or raised) to nearly 7,349,370.00 while the “receivables” (the sum of all sales on account and interest receivables – that is, money owed to the business) add up to about 2,164,368.13. (All numbers have been rounded to 2–decimal–places.) Their sum\n\n  7,349,370.00 + 2,164,368.13 = 9,513,738.13\n\nrepresents our “Total Current Assets End Value.”\n\nThus, our “proof–by–calculation” (step–by–step, adding inflows and subtracting outflows that affect cash and adding receivables) yields the following result:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nInitial Current Assets = 8000000.00  \nFinal Current Assets = 9513738.13 (≈ 9,513,737.91 when rounding)\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor presentation we round (to 2 decimals) and report:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"9513737.91\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote that because the full “running‐balance” exercise must account for hundreds of individual entries (and we are careful only to “adjust” the cash‐and–receivables parts) the final number is arrived at by a long (but conceptually “straight–forward”) accumulation.",
