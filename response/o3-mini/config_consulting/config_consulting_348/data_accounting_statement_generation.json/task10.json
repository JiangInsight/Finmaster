                        "content": "We must “build” the current balance reported under property, plant and equipment (non‐current assets) – that is, the “fixed assets” item. In our “problem” the only noncurrent asset transaction is the initial “Fixed Assets” balance of 5,000,000.00 as of December 31, 2023. Then over the reporting period two depreciation entries are recorded that will reduce the net (book) value of those assets. (Other “Purchase” transactions in the file are for inventory or service items—not additions to the fixed assets item.)\n\nStep 1. Identify the initial non‐current asset amount.  \n• The “Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets” row shows an amount of 5,000,000.00.  \n\nStep 2. Sum the depreciation expenses on fixed assets:  \n• Depreciation on 2024‑01‑01: 45,756.35  \n• Depreciation on 2024‑02‑01: 45,752.90  \nTotal depreciation = 45,756.35 + 45,752.90 = 91,509.25\n\nStep 3. Compute the “end” (net) value of non‐current assets:  \nNet non‐current assets = initial fixed assets – total depreciation  \n  = 5,000,000.00 – 91,509.25  \n  = 4,908,490.75\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"4908490.75\"\n  }\n}",
