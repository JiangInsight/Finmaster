                        "content": "We need to “derive” the net change in the interest receivable balance over the period. In our problem the only transactions that affect the interest receivable account are those whose “type” is “Interest Receivables” (and their “receive_method” is “Interest receviable”). (In the cash‐flow statement the “operating” activity adjusts the net income by “an increase” in an asset account—which is reported as a negative adjustment, while a decrease in an asset is reported as a positive adjustment.) \n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n\n1. From the posted transactions we pick out every row whose id starts with “Interest…”. For each such row we take its “amount”. (In our data the “amount” value is already recorded with the sign that represents an increase in the asset account.)\n\n2. Then we add all these amounts together. (Because there is no “beginning” interest receivable balance given, we assume that the running “ending” balance is just the sum of these new additions. In a cash‐flow statement an increase in an asset “uses” cash so the result is shown with a “(Increase)” sign, i.e. a negative cash flow adjustment.)\n\nFor example, in our dataset the following 36 interest transactions appear with amounts as summarized (all amounts are in the same unit):\n\n • Interest20240101001:  445.000  \n • Interest20240102002:  436.100  \n • Interest20240103003:  435.833  \n • Interest20240104004:  435.388  \n • Interest20240105005:  434.053  \n • Interest20240106006:  434.053  \n • Interest20240107007:  434.053  \n • Interest20240108008:  434.053  \n • Interest20240109009:  407.353  \n • Interest20240110010:  407.353  \n • Interest20240111011:  407.353  \n • Interest20240112012:  407.353  \n • Interest20240113013:  407.353  \n • Interest20240114014:  407.353  \n • Interest20240115015:  407.353  \n • Interest20240116016:  407.353  \n • Interest20240117017:  407.353  \n • Interest20240118018:  407.353  \n • Interest20240119019:  407.353  \n • Interest20240120020:  407.353  \n • Interest20240121021:  389.553  \n • Interest20240122022:  389.553  \n • Interest20240123023:  389.553  \n • Interest20240124024:  389.553  \n • Interest20240125025:  389.553  \n • Interest20240126026:  388.663  \n • Interest20240127027:  387.328  \n • Interest20240128028:  387.328  \n • Interest20240129029:  387.328  \n • Interest20240130030:  387.328  \n • Interest20240131031:  387.328  \n • Interest20240201032:  387.328  \n • Interest20240202033:  387.328  \n • Interest20240203034:  387.328  \n • Interest20240204035:  381.988  \n • Interest20240205036:  381.988  \n\n3. Adding these step–by–step gives (approximately):\n\n – Sum after the first 20 entries ≈ 8,375.77  \n – After adding the next 16 entries the running total becomes about 14,574.80\n\n(A careful summing of all 36 entries yields a total of approximately 14,574.80.)\n\n4. Because the interest receivable balance increased by 14,574.80 over the period, when “adjusting” net income in the operating section of the cash flow statement we show this as an “increase in an asset” (which uses cash). Therefore the “(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable” will be reported as –14,574.80.\n\nThus the final solution is:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-14574.80\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis is the number you would subtract (i.e. show as a negative adjustment in an indirect cash flow statement) to reconcile net income to cash from operating activities.",
