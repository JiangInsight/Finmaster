                        "content": "We need to find the “accumulated depreciation” on the balance sheet. In our case the “accumulated depreciation” is the total depreciation recorded (since there was no depreciation before the fixed asset was recorded). In our transactions the fixed asset was introduced on 2023‑12‑31 with an amount of 5,000,000.00 and no depreciation has been recorded before that date. (This means the “Initial accumulated depreciation” is 0.00.)\n\nThen look for transactions with type “Depreciation.” We see two such entries:\n\n• The first depreciation transaction on 2024‑01‑01 (ID: Depreciation20240101001) recorded an amount of 45,756.35.\n• Later the transaction on 2024‑02‑01 (ID: Depreciation20240201002) recorded an amount of 45,752.90 (the amount given is 45752.899999999994, rounding to 45,752.90).\n\nSince depreciation is accumulated over time, the “end value” for accumulated depreciation is the sum of the two depreciation amounts:\n  45,756.35 + 45,752.90 = 91,509.25\n\nThus, the value at the beginning of the period remains 0.00 and at the end (after the two depreciation transactions) the accumulated depreciation is 91,509.25.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"91509.25\"}}",
