                        "content": "We must “derive” the “liability‐side” amounts from the transactions. In many bookkeeping systems the “balance sheet” is built on two “sides”: assets (really “what have we got”) and liabilities/equity (what we owe or “obligations”). In our sample example the “Initial” transactions (“Cash deposit”, “Bank deposit”, “Fixed Assets”) enter the asset side only so there is no opening liability balance (that is why the “Total Liabilities Initial Value” was 0.00). Then, whenever the company makes purchases on “credit” (that is not paid immediately and with the payment method usually recorded as “Account Payable”) these amounts become “liabilities” (that is, amounts the company must pay later).\n\nWhen you examine our current data you will note that only the transactions of type “Purchase” really represent “payables” provided their “payment/receipt_status” is Unpaid OR – even if paid – the entry is recorded with a “payment_method” that indicates a “credit account” (in our system we assume that if a Purchase is marked as Unpaid and its payment method is “Account Payable,” then it is a liability). In the present data set the “Initial” rows remain asset entries (and so do Sales, Depreciation, Expense, and the “Interest Receivables” – the very name “receivable” indicates that money is due from customers, not a liability).\n\nThus, after scanning all rows we identify the following lines as “liability‐affecting” (that is, it is a Purchase entry made on credit):\n\n• Row 7 – Purchase20231231001: Purchase of 60000.00, marked Unpaid with Account Payable → +60000.00\n• Row 24 – Purchase20231231006: Purchase of 60000.00, Unpaid with Account Payable → +60000.00\n• Row 36 – Purchase20231231007: Purchase of 10000.00, Unpaid (also using Account Payable) → +10000.00\n• Row 68 – Purchase20231231011: Purchase of 300000.00, Unpaid (with the appropriate payment mode) → +300000.00\n• Row 85 – Purchase20231231014: Purchase of 2000.00, Unpaid → +2000.00\n• Row 98 – Purchase20231231016: Purchase of 40000.00, Unpaid → +40000.00\n• Row 142 – Purchase20231231021: Purchase of 3000.00, Unpaid → +3000.00\n• Row 148 – Purchase20231231022: Purchase of 10000.00, Unpaid → +10000.00\n\nAdding these up gives:\n  60000.00 + 60000.00 = 120000.00  \n  120000.00 + 10000.00 = 130000.00  \n  130000.00 + 300000.00 = 430000.00  \n  430000.00 + 2000.00 = 432000.00  \n  432000.00 + 40000.00 = 472000.00  \n  472000.00 + 3000.00 = 475000.00  \n  475000.00 + 10000.00 = 485000.00\n\nSince none of our “Initial” rows were liabilities the opening (initial) liability balance remains zero.\n\nThus the balance–sheet “liability” item in our new set of transactions is as follows:\n\n  Total Liabilities Initial Value: 0.00  \n  Total Liabilities End Value: 485000.00\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"485000.00\"} }",
