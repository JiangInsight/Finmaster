(In our books no “initial” entry reported any outstanding credit so we assume that the year–start accounts receivable was zero.) In this problem the only “sale” entries that add to AR are those whose receive_method field is “Account Receviable” (that is, sales made on credit – note that some sales are settled immediately via cash and therefore do not “build up” AR).\n\nThe table below shows (roughly) the transactions we add. (Other transaction types such as interest receivables are kept “separately” and do not count into the operating accounts receivable balance for credit sales.)\n\nBelow we list the sale records that “increase AR” along with their amount values:\n\n1. Sale20240103002:  42365.71  \n2. Sale20240103003:  210203.88  \n3. Sale20240105007:  14282.89  \n4. Sale20240105008:  57947.08  \n5. Sale20240105009:  2074.66  \n6. Sale20240106011:  2971.81  \n7. Sale20240107013:  2160.53  \n8. Sale20240107014:  43879.89  \n9. Sale20240115020:  10791.32  \n10. Sale20240115021:  41521.81  \n11. Sale20240117024:  220256.39  \n12. Sale20240117025:  59992.23  \n13. Sale20240118028:  57321.13  \n14. Sale20240121035:  232916.62  \n15. Sale20240121036:  188606.93  \n16. Sale20240123039:  48078.98  \n17. Sale20240124041:  12006.12  \n18. Sale20240126044:  52600.07  \n19. Sale20240126045:  218551.72  \n20. Sale20240128051:  40096.08  \n21. Sale20240129053:  2994.10  \n22. Sale20240129054:  13434.22  \n23. Sale20240130055:  55638.81  \n24. Sale20240131058:  13921.69  \n25. Sale20240131059:  276920.02  \n26. Sale20240202063:  195343.26  \n27. Sale20240202064:  13709.42  \n28. Sale20240202065:  10969.01  \n29. Sale20240203066:  2658.79  \n30. Sale20240203067:  2842.50  \n31. Sale20240203068:  2734.78\n\nThere are several other “Sale” entries in the table; however, their “receive_method” is marked “Cash” (or they are “Paid”) so we do not include those in the AR balance.\n\nNow, by summing the amounts from the 31 qualifying sale records we get:\n\n  42365.71  \n+ 210203.88 = 252569.59  \n+ 14282.89 = 266852.48  \n+ 57947.08 = 324799.56  \n+ 2074.66 = 326874.22  \n+ 2971.81 = 329846.03  \n+ 2160.53 = 332006.56  \n+ 43879.89 = 375886.45  \n+ 10791.32 = 386677.77  \n+ 41521.81 = 428199.58  \n+ 220256.39 = 648455.97  \n+ 59992.23 = 708448.20  \n+ 57321.13 = 765769.33  \n+ 232916.62 = 998685.95  \n+ 188606.93 = 1187292.88  \n+ 48078.98 = 1235371.86  \n+ 12006.12 = 1247377.98  \n+ 52600.07 = 1299978.05  \n+ 218551.72 = 1518529.77  \n+ 40096.08 = 1558625.85  \n+ 2994.10 = 1561619.95  \n+ 13434.22 = 1575054.17  \n+ 55638.81 = 1630692.98  \n+ 13921.69 = 1644614.67  \n+ 276920.02 = 1921534.69  \n+ 195343.26 = 2116877.95  \n+ 13709.42 = 2130587.37  \n+ 10969.01 = 2141556.38  \n+ 2658.79 = 2144215.17  \n+ 2842.50 = 2147057.67  \n+ 2734.78 = 2149792.45  \n\nThus, at the end of the period the cumulative “credit‐sales” that have not been “paid” (and are reflected as “Accounts Receivable”) amount to 2,149,792.45.\n\nSince no opening (initial) AR was present we take that as zero.\n\nTherefore the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"2149792.45\"\n  }\n}",
