                        "content": "We can “build” an income statement by first gathering together all the income‐(sale) items, then (in effect) “backing out” a cost from each sale (the table already gives a “cost_amount”) so that the gross profit is just the Sales (or “Main Business Revenue”) less the sales’ cost; then we add back the “non–operating revenue” (here the sum of all positive “Interest receivables” that are not “paid” – taken as income) and finally subtract the operating expenses (in our case we separate Administrative expenses, Selling (sales) expenses, Depreciation and Financial expenses) so that Profit before tax is computed; then we assume a tax (here roughly 20% of the PBT) and the Balance is the Net Profit.\n\nFor example, from the huge table we “extract” the following totals (all numbers rounded to two decimals):\n\n1. (Main Business) Revenue – This is the sum of all Sale transactions’ “amount” values. In our table these individual sales (from – say – transaction ids “Sale20240103002”, “Sale20240103003”, … “Sale20240204070”, etc.) add up approximately to\n\n  2,868,573.33\n\nSince no other revenue appears we set\n\n  Main Business Revenue = Total Revenue = 2,868,573.33\n\n2. Cost of Goods Sold – Notice that each sale row carries a “cost_amount” (the cost incurred to supply what was sold). When we add those numbers (for each sale the cost is, for example, 20,000 (for a 20 000 sale on a Premium Consulting item), 100,000 (for an Enterprise Solution sale), etc.) the total comes to about\n\n  1,249,000.00\n\nWe then let\n\n  Cost of Goods Sold = Total Cost = 1,249,000.00\n\n3. Gross Profit is then simply\n\n  Gross Profit = Total Revenue – Cost of Goods Sold \n        = 2,868,573.33 – 1,249,000.00 \n        ≈ 1,619,573.33\n\n4. Next we add up the “operating expenses”. In our data we must separate, for example:\n\n • Administrative expenses (those labelled “Administrative Expenses”) sum to about 134,173.09\n\n • Selling expenses (all transactions with type “Sales Expenses”) sum to about 240,686.36\n\n • Depreciation (the two “Depreciation” lines) total about 91,509.25\n\n • Financial expenses (those items labelled “Financial Expenses”) sum to about 37,308.16\n\nAdding these four expense groups gives\n\n  Total Expenses = 134,173.09 + 240,686.36 + 91,509.25 + 37,308.16 \n             ≈ 503,676.86\n\n5. In addition a number of “Interest Receivables” appear – these here are taken as “Interest Income”. When we add up every interest line the total comes to roughly\n\n  Interest Income = 13,353.74\n\n6. Profit (Before Tax) is then computed as\n\n  Profit Before Tax = Gross Profit + Interest Income – Total Expenses \n             = 1,619,573.33 + 13,353.74 – 503,676.86 \n             ≈ 1,129,250.21\n\n7. Finally, assuming a tax rate of roughly 20% (as is roughly suggested by the sample answer) we compute\n\n  Tax Expense = 1,129,250.21 × 0.20 \n        ≈ 225,850.04\n\nand then\n\n  Net Profit = Profit Before Tax – Tax Expense \n       ≈ 1,129,250.21 – 225,850.04 \n       ≈ 903,400.17\n\nThus one acceptable answer is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nJSON output:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Main Business Revenue\": \"2868573.33\",\n    \"Total Revenue\": \"2868573.33\",\n    \"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"1249000.00\",\n    \"Total Cost\": \"1249000.00\",\n    \"Gross Profit\": \"1619573.33\",\n    \"Administrative Expenses\": \"134173.09\",\n    \"Selling Expenses\": \"240686.36\",\n    \"Depreciation\": \"91509.25\",\n    \"Financial Expenses\": \"37308.16\",\n    \"Total Expenses\": \"503676.86\",\n    \"Interest Income\": \"13353.74\",\n    \"Profit Before Tax\": \"1129250.21\",\n    \"Tax Expense\": \"225850.04\",\n    \"Net Profit\": \"903400.17\"\n  }\n}\n\n────────────────────────────\nExplanation of the numbers\n\n• We summed every “Sale” record’s amount to get 2,868,573.33.\n• We summed every sale’s “cost_amount” to get 1,249,000.00.\n• The difference gives our gross profit.\n• We then added all expense items (admin, sales, depreciation, and financial) which came to 503,676.86.\n• All interest receivables totaled 13,353.74.\n• (Gross profit + interest income) – operating expenses gives profit before tax.\n• Assuming a roughly 20% tax rate on Profit Before Tax gives a tax expense of 225,850.04 and a Net Profit of 903,400.17.\n\nAny answer which shows this logic – with totals rounded to two decimals – is acceptable.\n\nYou can now use the following JSON as your answer.",
