In other words, Gross Profit is the total of the “profit” column in the sale rows.\n\nLet’s explain briefly the steps we took:\n\n1. We scanned the transactions (ignoring “Initial”, “Expense”, “Purchase”, “Interest”, “Depreciation” and so on) and picked out only those records whose “type” begins with “Sale”. (For each sale the “profit” is already computed as “after_tax_amount – cost_amount”.)\n\n2. For every sale row we noted the “profit” value. For example (the following are a few representative rows):\n\n  • Sale20240103002 profit = 22,365.71  \n  • Sale20240103003 profit = 110,203.88  \n  • Sale20240105007 profit = 9,282.89  \n  • Sale20240105008 profit = 37,947.08  \n  • … and so on.\n\n3. We then added every “profit” value from all sale transactions.\n\nA careful summing of all 52 sale rows (sorted into sequential groups – see our “working‐notes” above) gives a total of 1,620,560.42.\n\nThus the final gross profit item is 1,620,560.42.\n\nBelow is our answer in the required JSON format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Gross Profit\": \"1620560.42\"} }",
