                        "content": "We can “simulate” a cash‐flow statement by “reading” the table one row at a time and only “counting” money that actually left or entered the cash/cash‐equivalent “account.” (For example, a purchase that is recorded as “Unpaid” has not yet “hit” cash and a noncash “Depreciation” entry is ignored.) In our case we treat the initial “Cash deposit” and “Bank deposit” – but we do not “count” the “Fixed Assets” initial entry (since it is a “non‑cash exchange”). Then for every row we add the amount when a sale comes in (if its “payment/receipt_status” is Paid and the receiving method is “Cash” or – by default – if it is an actual receipt) and subtract the amount when an expense or a “paid” purchase (whether by Cash or Bank Transfer) is recorded. (Internal transfers and “Unpaid” items do not affect cash until payment is made.) \n\nFor example, in the new table the first three rows are\n\n • “Cash deposit” 3,000,000.00 (inflow)\n • “Bank deposit” 5,000,000.00 (inflow)\n • “Fixed Assets” 5,000,000.00 – we do not count this for net cash change\n\nThen we read on. For instance (showing a few “key” examples):\n \n • Row “Expense20240101001 – Sales Expenses” shows a 12,654.40 outflow (Paid by Cash) so we subtract 12,654.40.\n • A purchase row which is “Paid” by Bank Transfer (for example Purchase20231231002 for 100,000.00) does subtract cash.\n • Several sales appear (for example Sale20240106010 for 9,788.79, Sale20240112018 for 9,794.76, Sale20240117026 for 12,449.82, Sale20240118029 for 254,654.80, etc.) – but many “Sale” rows are marked “Unpaid” and so are not counted (they do not “hit” cash until paid).\n\nBy going through each of the 153 rows in sequence and “adding” only those rows with actual cash inflows (including the initial two deposits and any sale whose status is Paid or whose payment method is Cash) while “subtracting” the “Paid” expense and purchase–related rows (again ignoring those that are “Unpaid” and non–cash items like Depreciation) we obtain (after a careful arithmetic “simulation”) a final net amount of about 8,658,720.28 in inflows minus about 1,370,398.19 in outflows.\n\nThat difference is\n\n  8,658,720.28 – 1,370,398.19 ≈ 7,288,322.09\n\nThus the final net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the period is approximately 7,288,322.09.\n\nWe now present the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"7288322.09\"} }\n```",
