In our case investing activities include transactions related to the acquisition or sale of long‐term assets (for example, fixed assets).\n\nIf you scan the table you will note that most “Expense”, “Sale”, “Purchase” and “Interest Receivables” items relate to operating activity. The only transaction that is clearly related to an investing activity is the one with type “Fixed Assets” (the third row) whose amount is 5,000,000.0. Because a purchase of fixed assets is a cash outflow (an investment in the business’ productive capacity) the cash flow is recorded as a negative number.\n\nThus, the net cash flow from investing activities is –5,000,000.0.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-5000000.0\"\n  }\n}",
