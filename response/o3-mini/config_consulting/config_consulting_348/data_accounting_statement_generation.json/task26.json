In the list there are two depreciation rows:\n\n• The first is on 2024‑01‑01 with an amount of 45756.35  \n• The second is on 2024‑02‑01 with an amount of 45752.899999999994\n\nSince the later (final) entry is dated February 1, 2024, its amount is taken to be the final depreciation amount. Rounding this to two decimals we get 45752.90.\n\nThus, the final depreciation item is 45752.90.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Depreciation\": \"45752.90\"\n  }\n}",
