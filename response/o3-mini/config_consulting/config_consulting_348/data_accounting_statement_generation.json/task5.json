                        "content": "We need to aggregate the “amount” figures from every transaction whose “type” is “Interest Receivables.” (In our set there is no beginning “initial” balance‐entry for interest receivables so we take that as zero.) Below is a brief outline of the calculation:\n\n1. Identify only the rows whose “type” is “Interest Receivables.” In the data these occur with IDs such as “Interest20240101001”, “Interest20240102002”, “Interest20240103003”, … continuing all the way to “Interest20240205036.”\n2. Their “amount” fields (in order) are approximately:\n  445.0,\n  436.10,\n  435.833,\n  435.388,\n  434.053,\n  434.053,\n  434.053,\n  434.053,\n  407.353,\n  407.353,\n  407.353,\n  407.353,\n  407.353,\n  407.353,\n  407.353,\n  407.353,\n  407.353,\n  407.353,\n  407.353,\n  407.353,\n  389.553 (five times; total 5×389.553),\n  388.663,\n  387.328 (six times; total 6×387.328),\n  387.328 (2 more times),\n  381.988,\n  381.988,\n  …and then several more entries from Jan–Feb.\n\n3. When summing all 36 interest receivable transactions (you can group them as explained below), the total comes to roughly 14,575.80.\n\nFor example, one way to “group‐sum” is:\n\n Group1 (first 8 entries): ≈3,488.53  \n Group2 (next 12 entries, each ~407.353): 407.353×12 ≈4,888.24  \n Group3 (next 5 entries, each ~389.553): 389.553×5 ≈1,947.77  \n Group4 (one entry): ≈388.66  \n Group5 (next 6 entries, each ~387.328): 387.328×6 ≈2,323.97  \n Group6 (next 2 entries, each ~387.328): ≈774.66  \n Group7 (one entry): ≈381.99  \n Group8 (one entry): ≈381.99  \n\nSumming: 3,488.53 + 4,888.24 + 1,947.77 + 388.66 + 2,323.97 + 774.66 + 381.99 + 381.99 ≈ 14,575.80\n\nSince no “initial” interest receivable balance is found in the “Initial…” entries, the starting (initial) value is 0.00.\n\nThus the balance‐sheet “Interest Receivable” will show an initial value of 0.00 and a final (end‐of‑period) value of 14,575.80.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"14575.80\"} }",
