For each such sale the “after_tax_amount” becomes the amount that the customer owes (assuming no collections have been recorded yet). (Sales that are paid with cash already do not create a receivable.)\n\nBelow we list each sale row that increases AR and note its “after_tax_amount” (in the details the “after_tax_amount” appears after the “tax_amount”):\n\n1. Sale20240103002 – after_tax_amount = 40,247.42  \n2. Sale20240103003 – 199,693.69  \n3. Sale20240105007 – 13,568.75  \n4. Sale20240105008 – 55,049.73  \n5. Sale20240105009 – 1,970.93  \n6.

(Recall that an increase in a working‑capital account is a deduction from operating cash flow.) In other words, we show it as a negative number.\n\nTherefore, the final “(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable” is –2,042,302.84.\n\nSo our answer is:\n\n{\n  \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-2042302.84\"\n} \n\nBelow is our final answer in the requested JSON format. \n\n--------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-2042302.84\"}}\n```",
