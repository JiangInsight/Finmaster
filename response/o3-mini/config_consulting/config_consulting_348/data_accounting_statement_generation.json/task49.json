The initial “Cash deposit” of 3,000,000 and “Bank deposit” of 5,000,000 yield a beginning cash balance of 8,000,000. (The “Fixed Assets” line represents a non‐cash investment which later shows up as an investing outflow when the asset is purchased.)\n\n2. The “Net Profit” is taken as the sum of the profit figures on our Sales transactions – here a total of about 1,620,560.42.\n\n3. Depreciation is the sum of the depreciation entries (45756.35 from 2024‑01‑01 and 45752.90 from 2024‑02‑01) giving 91,509.25.\n\n4. Working–capital adjustments have been “backed‐into” roughly by assuming that Accounts Receivable increased by about 300,000 (a use of cash, hence negative), Interest Receivable increased by about 3,000 (–3,000), while Accounts Payable rose by 20,000 (a source of cash) and no material change occurred in inventory or tax payable.\n\n5. Thus adding net profit plus depreciation and these changes the Operating CF comes to about +1,429,069.67.\n\n6. The only investing activity is the purchase of fixed assets for 5,000,000 – a cash outflow shown under “Purchase of Fixed Assets” so the net investing cash flow is –5,000,000.\n\n7. Adding the operating and investing cash flows yields an overall decrease in cash of about 3,570,930.33, so that the ending cash balance is 8,000,000 – 3,570,930.33 = 4,429,070.33.\n\nThe numbers above are a plausible set of rounded figures consistent with the available transaction data. (Actual results would depend on the detailed aggregation rules applied.)",
