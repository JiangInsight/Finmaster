                        "content": "We can “simulate” an operating‐activities cash flow calculation by “reading” only those transactions that affect cash (ignoring noncash adjustments such as depreciation and items still “unpaid” or “uncollected” as noted).\n\nFor example, one may “classify” each record into one of these categories:\n • Cash receipts from customers (a sale that is “Paid” using Cash or other liquid method).\n • Cash payments for expenses (all “Expense‐” records with “Paid” status)\n • Cash payments for purchases (when the “Purchase” record is “Paid”)\n • Noncash items such as “Depreciation” are not “cash outflows” so they get ignored in the cash‐flow total.\n • Any record that is “Unpaid” or that the “payment/receipt_status” is not “Paid” does not affect the cash balance now.\n\nIn the sample data below we “pick out” the operating transactions and then sum (inflows minus outflows).\n\nBelow is one way one might “step‐through” the work. (The following “listing” of numbers is for illustration – we add up all “Paid” operating receipts then subtract all “Paid” operating payments.)\n\n1. Among “Sale” records, only those with payment received in Cash contribute as inflows. In our case (with our many transactions) these “cash sales” came in with amounts such as:\n  9788.79, 53770.35, 9794.76, 12449.82, 254654.80, 202361.10, 9687.98, 56577.75, 2061.60, 44816.04, and 2757.29.\n When you add these the total cash inflow from customers is approximately 658,720.28.\n\n2. Next, all operating “cash‐outflows” come from:\n – Expense records that were “Paid” (for Sales Expenses or Administrative Expenses or Financial Expenses)\n – Purchase records that were “Paid” (for items bought for operations, for example inventory, consulting etc)\n (We ignore “Depreciation” because that is noncash and we ignore records still “Unpaid”.)\n When one carefully “adds” all these outflow amounts (by going record‐by‐record) the total comes to roughly 1,483,087.22.\n\n3. Then the net operating cash flow is computed by subtracting outflows from inflows:\n  Net Operating Cash Flow ≈ 658,720.28 – 1,483,087.22 ≈ –823,366.94\n\nThus, based on the “Paid” (cash) transactions from sales (inflows) and expenses/purchases (outflows), the final net cash flow from operating activities comes out to be about –823,366.94.\n\nThe final answer is presented in the requested JSON format below.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-823366.94\"\n  }\n}\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────\nNote: (Because the original data “list” is very long and many records are either “Unpaid” or noncash, one must carefully filter only the operating items that really change cash – this sample calculation shows one acceptable method and result.)",
