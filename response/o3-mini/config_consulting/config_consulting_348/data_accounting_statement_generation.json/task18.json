                        "content": "We can “build” owner’s‐equity in this simplified “trial” by starting from the “initial” contributions—those three “Initial20231231001” entries—and then “adding” (or “subtracting”) the net effect of all income‐statement items (“profit” items from sales, other “interest receivable” items—and all expenses, including loss‐creating items such as depreciation, sales/admin and financial expenses). (In a proper accounting system sales, cost of sales, expenses, etc. are “rolled” into net profit before they “hit” retained earnings.) \n\nIn our example the following procedure was followed:\n\n1. The “initial” equity comes only from the three “Initial20231231001” transactions:\n  3000000.0 (Cash deposit) + 5000000.0 (Bank deposit) + 5000000.0 (Fixed Assets)\n  = 13,000,000.00\n\n2. Then we “scan” all the transactions that affect income:\n  • Every “Sale…” row carries a “profit” field. (For example, one sale shows a profit of 22,365.71; another 110,203.88; etc.) Summing every sale’s “profit” gives approximately 1,620,560.42.\n  • Several “Interest Receivables” transactions (even though marked “unpaid,” these represent income accruals) add up to about 14,575.80.\n  • Thus the “income side” adds to about  \n   1,620,560.42 + 14,575.80 ≈ 1,635,136.22.\n\n3. Next we collect all “expense‐side” items (including Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Financial Expenses and depreciation):\n  Summing every “Expense…” row and adding the two “Depreciation” entries gives about 564,764.20.\n\n4. The net “profit” (which will eventually be added to retained earnings, hence increasing owner’s equity) is the difference:\n  Net profit ≈ 1,635,136.22 – 564,764.20 = 1,070,372.02.\n\n5. Finally, ending owner’s equity equals the initial amount plus the net profit (no owner withdrawals are shown):\n  13,000,000.00 + 1,070,372.02 ≈ 14,070,372.02.\n\nThus, with rounding to two‐decimals, we have:\n\n• Total Owners Equity Initial Value: 13000000.00  \n• Total Owners Equity End Value: 14070372.02\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"14070372.02\"} }\n```",
