                        "content": "We can view the “retained earnings” as the sum‐of (net income) earned during the period plus any beginning retained earnings. In our simplified model, we assume that the “initial” retained earnings are zero (that is, before any profit/loss‐flow was recorded). Then the net income is computed by “adding up” all the income items and “subtracting” the expenses (including operating expenses, depreciation and any “financial” (or other) expenses) – note that the purchases (and similar asset acquisitions) are not “expensed” immediately but affect inventory or fixed‐asset accounts so they do not “hit” the profit.\n\nIn our data the transactions that contribute to profit are the “Sale” transactions – each of which has a “profit” amount already computed – plus the “Interest Receivables” (which we treat as income when recorded). (Other types such as “Expense”, “Administrative Expenses”, “Sales Expenses”, “Financial Expenses” and “Depreciation” are “cost” items that reduce income.) \n\nFollowing a “step‐by‐step” (rough) calculation procedure:\n\n1. Sum over all the sale transactions’ profit amounts. (For example, one sale may show a profit of 22,365.71; another 110,203.88; and so on. When we add all these “profit” numbers from all the sale rows in our data we get approximately 1,620,560.42.)\n\n2. Sum over all “Interest Receivables” amounts (even if they are “Unpaid” they represent the income to be brought forward). When we add the many interest lines we get roughly 14,575.75.\n\n3. Sum over all expense‐side items (all “Expense” types – whether “Sales Expenses”, “Administrative Expenses”, “Financial Expenses” – plus all “Depreciation” amounts). For our many expense rows the total comes to nearly 584,908.06.\n\n4. Then the net income for the period is calculated as\n\n  net income = (total sale profit + total interest income) – (total expenses)\n        = (1,620,560.42 + 14,575.75) – 584,908.06 \n        ≈ 1,635,136.17 – 584,908.06 \n        ≈ 1,050,228.11\n\n5. With an initial retained earnings of 0.00, the “final” retained earnings is simply the beginning amount plus net income:\n  Retained Earnings (end) = 0.00 + 1,050,228.11 = 1,050,228.11\n\n(There is some rounding involved when summing so the final answer is given to two–decimal precision.)\n\nThus, the answer is as follows.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"1050228.11\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote: In practice an accountant would do a detailed review of each transaction’s treatment (for example, whether purchases are capitalized or expensed), but for our “toy‐calculation” based on the provided fields the above procedure gives the answer.",
