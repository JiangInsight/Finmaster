                        "content": "We can “build” the bank deposit balance by first taking the opening bank deposit and then “adjusting” it by all transactions that change the bank‐account (i.e. only those transactions that are settled by “Bank Transfer”). In our dataset the only row that “creates” a bank deposit is the “Initial20231231001” row with type “Bank deposit” and an amount of 5,000,000.00. Then – among the many transactions – only a few of the “Purchase” transactions use “Bank Transfer” as the payment method; these represent payments taken from the bank deposit. (Note that sales paid “in Cash” or “Account Receivable” do not affect the bank deposit account unless there is a subsequent “transfer” from cash to bank.) \n\nIn our problem data the following rows use “Bank Transfer” (or – in our dataset – are paid from bank funds):\n\n1. Purchase20231231002  \n  amount = 100,000.00 (Paid by Bank Transfer)\n\n2. Purchase20231231003  \n  amount = 3,000.00 (Paid by Bank Transfer)\n\n3. Purchase20231231004  \n  amount = 5,000.00 (Paid by Bank Transfer)\n\n4. Purchase20231231005  \n  amount = 15,000.00 (Paid by Bank Transfer)\n\n5. Purchase20231231008  \n  amount = 300,000.00 (Paid by Bank Transfer)\n\n6. Purchase20231231013  \n  amount = 200,000.00 (Paid by Bank Transfer)\n\n7. Purchase20231231017  \n  amount = 10,000.00 (Paid by Bank Transfer)\n\n8. Purchase20231231018  \n  amount = 15,000.00 (Paid by Bank Transfer)\n\n9. Purchase20231231023  \n  amount = 60,000.00 (Paid by Bank Transfer)\n\nWhen we sum these amounts:\n  100,000 + 3,000 + 5,000 + 15,000 + 300,000 + 200,000 + 10,000 + 15,000 + 60,000 = 708,000.00\n\nThen the final bank deposit is calculated as:\n  Initial Bank deposit – total outflow via bank transfer =\n  5,000,000.00 – 708,000.00 = 4,292,000.00\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Bank Deposits Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Bank Deposits End Value': '4292000.00'}}",
