In our table the following “Purchase” rows meet that criterion:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001: Amount = 60,000.0, Payment Method = Account Payable, Status = Unpaid.\n2. Purchase20231231006: Amount = 60,000.0, Payment Method = Account Payable, Status = Unpaid.\n3. Purchase20231231007: Amount = 10,000.0, Payment Method = Account Payable, Status = Unpaid.\n4. Purchase20231231011: Amount = 300,000.0, Payment Method = Account Payable, Status = Unpaid.\n5. Purchase20231231014: Amount = 2,000.0, Payment Method = Account Payable, Status = Unpaid.\n6. Purchase20231231016: Amount = 40,000.0, Payment Method = Account Payable, Status = Unpaid.\n7. Purchase20231231021: Amount = 3,000.0, Payment Method = Account Payable, Status = Unpaid.\n8. Purchase20231231022: Amount = 10,000.0, Payment Method = Account Payable, Status = Unpaid.\n\nNow, sum the amounts:\n\n• 60,000.0  \n+ 60,000.0 = 120,000.0  \n+ 10,000.0 = 130,000.0  \n+ 300,000.0 = 430,000.0  \n+ 2,000.0 = 432,000.0  \n+ 40,000.0 = 472,000.0  \n+ 3,000.0 = 475,000.0  \n+ 10,000.0 = 485,000.0\n\nThus the net (increase) in accounts payable is 485,000.00.\n\nWe now supply the answer in the requested json format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"485000.00\"} }\n```",
