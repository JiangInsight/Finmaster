In our work we scan the table row–by–row and add the interest transaction amounts. (For example, the very first interest record had an amount of 445.0, the next one 436.10, then 435.833, etc.) After summing up all the “Interest Receivables” amounts we get a total of approximately 14,574.80. (We assume a two–decimal rounding as in the example.)\n\nThus, the final interest income item is 14,574.80.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Interest Income\": \"14574.80\"\n  }\n}",
