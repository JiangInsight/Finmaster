In the provided table (ignoring other types such as Sales Expenses, Purchase, Depreciation, etc.), we find the following rows and amounts:\n\n1. Expense20240102001 – Administrative Expenses: 4,436.41  \n2. Expense20240107001 – Administrative Expenses: 7,572.85  \n3. Expense20240108001 – Administrative Expenses: 9,907.39  \n4. Expense20240109001 – Administrative Expenses: 7,508.13  \n5. Expense20240110001 – Administrative Expenses: 4,915.48  \n6. Expense20240110001 – Administrative Expenses (second record): 4,177.41  \n7. Expense20240111001 – Administrative Expenses: 7,460.00  \n8. Expense20240112001 – Administrative Expenses: 3,585.90  \n9. Expense20240113001 – Administrative Expenses: 16,185.43  \n10.

Expense20240203001 – Administrative Expenses: 8,643.30  \n14. Expense20240205001 – Administrative Expenses: 18,051.31  \n\nNow, let’s add these amounts step by step:\n\n• 4,436.41  \n  + 7,572.85 = 12,009.26  \n  + 9,907.39 = 21,916.65  \n  + 7,508.13 = 29,424.78  \n  + 4,915.48 = 34,340.26  \n  + 4,177.41 = 38,517.67  \n  + 7,460.00 = 45,977.67  \n  + 3,585.90 = 49,563.57  \n  + 16,185.43 = 65,749.00  \n  + 19,716.14 = 85,465.14  \n  + 7,955.72 = 93,420.86  \n  + 14,057.62 = 107,478.48  \n  + 8,643.30 = 116,121.78  \n  + 18,051.31 = 134,173.09\n\nThus the final total for Administrative Expenses is 134,173.09.\n\nWe then format the answer as requested:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Administrative Expenses\": \"134173.09\"}\n}",
