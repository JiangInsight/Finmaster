In this “transaction‐based approach” the sales records (each Sale row) already carry a cost (typically the cost_amount) representing the cost of inventory that was used to satisfy that sale. (Other purchasing or inventory rows change the balance sheet; the “cost of goods sold” is computed “flow‐through” when sales occur.)\n\nThus, we go through each sale transaction that shows a cost_amount value. (Only sale rows have a nonempty cost_amount; the other kinds – “Initial”, “Expense”, “Purchase” etc.– do not directly contribute to cost‐of‐goods‐sold in the income statement.) For example, one sale (Sale20240103002) has cost_amount = 20,000; another has 100,000; and so on. (In our working we “list” each sale row, add up the cost_amount amounts, and obtain the grand total.)\n\nStep‐by‐step we collected the cost for each “Sale” as follows:\n1.
