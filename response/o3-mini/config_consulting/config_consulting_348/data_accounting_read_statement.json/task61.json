In our input income statement, the “Selling Expenses” is listed as 309942.03.\n\n• For “cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets” – this corresponds to the “Purchase of Fixed Assets” line item in the cash flow statement. In our input cash flow statement, “Purchase of Fixed Assets” has a value of 0.00.\n\nStep 2: Format the answer as required.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value1\": \"309942.03\",\n    \"value2\": \"0.00\"\n  }\n}",
