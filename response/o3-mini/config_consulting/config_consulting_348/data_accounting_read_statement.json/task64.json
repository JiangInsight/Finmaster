Its End_amount is 13000000.00.\n2. From the Income Statement – Profit or loss before deducting tax expense: find the \"Profit Before Tax\" line. Its Amount is 1049228.78.\n3. From the Cash Flow Statement – The addition in what is owed (for goods/services purchased on credit): find the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" line. Its Amount is 485000.00.\n\nGrouping them in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement, the solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value1\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"value2\": \"1049228.78\",\n    \"value3\": \"485000.00\"\n  }\n}",
