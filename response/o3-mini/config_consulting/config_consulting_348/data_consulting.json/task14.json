                        "content": "We first need to calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio by dividing the net sales (usually taken as Main Business Revenue) by the average Accounts Receivable.\n\nStep 1. Identify the Main Business Revenue from the income statement:\n  Main Business Revenue = 2,869,560.42\n\nStep 2. Determine the beginning and ending Accounts Receivable amounts from the balance sheet:\n  Beginning Accounts Receivable (from 2023-12-31) = 0.00\n  Ending Accounts Receivable (from 2024-02-05) = 2,149,792.45\n\nStep 3. Calculate the average Accounts Receivable:\n  Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2\n  Average AR = (0.00 + 2,149,792.45) / 2 = 1,074,896.225\n\nStep 4. Compute the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:\n  Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Main Business Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable\n  Ratio = 2,869,560.42 / 1,074,896.225 ≈ 2.67\n\nThus the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.67\"\n  }\n}",
