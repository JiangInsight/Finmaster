Here, only current liabilities are provided:  \n  Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 485000.00 + 143478.02 = 628478.02  \n• Total Owner’s Equity (end of period) is given as 13905750.76  \n• Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity  \n  = 628478.02 / 13905750.76 ≈ 0.04522  \n  Rounded, we can state it as 0.045  \n\n2. Net Profit Margin  \n• Net Profit is from the income statement = 905750.76  \n• Total Revenue is given as 2869560.42  \n• Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100  \n  = (905750.76 / 2869560.42) × 100 ≈ 31.58%  \n\n3. Return on Assets (ROA)  \n• Total Assets (end of period) from the balance sheet = 14534228.78  \n• ROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) × 100  \n  = (905750.76 / 14534228.78) × 100 ≈ 6.23%  \n\n4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n• Accounts Receivable at the beginning of the period is 0 and at the end is 2149792.45, so the average is calculated as:  \n  Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 2149792.45) / 2 = 1074896.225  \n• Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n  = 2869560.42 / 1074896.225 ≈ 2.67  \n\nThus, the final solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.045', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.58%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '6.23%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.67'}}",
