In the provided balance sheet, these are:\n • Accounts Payable = 485,000.00  \n • Taxes Payable = 143,478.02  \nThus, Total Current Liabilities = 485,000.00 + 143,478.02 = 628,478.02.\n\nStep 2. From the cash flow statement, we take the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities, which is given as -650,630.22.\n\nStep 3. The Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is calculated as:  \n  Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Current Liabilities)  \nSubstitute the numbers:  \n  = (-650,630.22) / (628,478.02)  \n  ≈ -1.036, which rounds to -1.04.\n\nThus, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is -1.04.\n\nThe final answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.04'} }",
