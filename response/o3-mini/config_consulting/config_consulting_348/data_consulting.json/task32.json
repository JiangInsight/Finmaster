Free Cash Flow (FCF):\n   - FCF is typically calculated as: Operating Cash Flow – Capital Expenditures.\n   - Here, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is –650630.22 and the Purchase of Fixed Assets is 0.00.\n   - Therefore, FCF = –650630.22 – 0.00 = –650630.22.\n\n2. Return on Assets (ROA):\n   - ROA = Net Profit / Average Total Assets.\n   - From the balance sheet, the beginning Total Assets (2023-12-31) are 13000000.00 and the ending Total Assets (2024-02-05) are 14534228.78.\n   - Average Total Assets = (13000000.00 + 14534228.78) / 2 = 13767114.39.\n   - Net Profit (from the income statement) = 905750.76.\n   - ROA = 905750.76 / 13767114.39 ≈ 0.0658, or 6.58%.\n\n3. Return on Equity (ROE):\n   - ROE = Net Profit / Average Shareholders' Equity.\n   - From the balance sheet, beginning Owner’s Equity is 13000000.00 and ending Owner’s Equity is 13905750.76.\n   - Average Equity = (13000000.00 + 13905750.76) / 2 = 13452875.38.\n   - ROE = 905750.76 / 13452875.38 ≈ 0.06736, or 6.74%.\n\n4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:\n   - This ratio is calculated as Operating Cash Flow / Net Profit.\n   - Using the values: Operating Cash Flow = –650630.22 and Net Profit = 905750.76.\n   - Ratio = –650630.22 / 905750.76 ≈ –0.718, or approximately –0.72.\n\n5. Net Profit Margin:\n   - Net Profit Margin = Net Profit / Total Revenue.\n   - From the income statement, Total Revenue = 2869560.42.\n   - Net Profit = 905750.76.\n   - Margin = 905750.76 / 2869560.42 ≈ 0.3157, or 31.57%.\n\n6. Gross Profit Margin:\n   - Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Total Revenue.\n   - From the income statement, Gross Profit = 1620560.42 and Total Revenue = 2869560.42.\n   - Margin = 1620560.42 / 2869560.42 ≈ 0.5646, or 56.46%.\n\nThe final JSON solution is as shown above.",
