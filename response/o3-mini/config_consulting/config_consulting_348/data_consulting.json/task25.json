Here, Total Liabilities = Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity – Total Owner’s Equity.\n = 14534228.78 – 13905750.76 = 628478.02\n• Total Owner's Equity is given as 13905750.76.\n• Debt to Equity Ratio = 628478.02 / 13905750.76 ≈ 0.04521, which rounds to 0.05.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Net Profit Margin.\n• Net Profit is 905750.76.\n• Total Revenue is 2869560.42.\n• Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100\n = (905750.76 / 2869560.42) × 100 ≈ 31.57%\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n• Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is –650630.22.\n• Total Current Liabilities is 628478.02.\n• Ratio = –650630.22 / 628478.02 ≈ –1.0365, which rounds to –1.04.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.05\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"31.57%\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.04\"\n  }\n}",
