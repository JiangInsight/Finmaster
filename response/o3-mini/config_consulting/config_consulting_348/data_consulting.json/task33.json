                        "content": "Step 1: Gather the necessary data from the statements.\n\n• From the Balance Sheet (end amounts on 2024-02-05):\n – Cash on Hand = 3,057,369.78  \n – Bank Deposits = 4,292,000.00  \n – Interest Receivable = 14,575.80  \n – Accounts Receivable = 2,149,792.45  \n – Inventory = 112,000.00  \n – Total Current Assets = 9,625,738.03  \n – Current Liabilities (sum of Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable) = 485,000.00 + 143,478.02 = 628,478.02  \n – Owner’s Equity = 13,905,750.76  \n\n• From the Cash Flow Statement:\n – Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –650,630.22\n\n• From the Income Statement:\n – Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = 1,249,000.00  \n – Net Profit = 905,750.76\n\nStep 2: Compute each ratio.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n Definition: Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities  \n Calculation: –650,630.22 / 628,478.02 ≈ –1.04\n\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \n Definition: Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities  \n Calculation: –650,630.22 / 628,478.02 ≈ –1.04  \n (Note: In our sample problem the “debt” used was the current liabilities since no other liabilities were provided.)\n\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio  \n Definition: Inventory Turnover Ratio = COGS / Average Inventory  \n Note: Beginning inventory was 0 and Ending Inventory = 112,000.  \n Average Inventory = (0 + 112,000) / 2 = 56,000  \n Calculation: 1,249,000.00 / 56,000 ≈ 22.30\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n Definition: Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Owner’s Equity  \n Using Total Current Liabilities as Total Debt = 628,478.02  \n Calculation: 628,478.02 / 13,905,750.76 ≈ 0.0452, or approximately 0.05\n\n5. Quick Ratio  \n Definition: Quick Ratio = (Quick Assets) / Current Liabilities, where Quick Assets = Total Current Assets – Inventory  \n Quick Assets = 9,625,738.03 – 112,000 = 9,513,738.03  \n Calculation: 9,513,738.03 / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.14\n\n6. Current Ratio  \n Definition: Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \n Calculation: 9,625,738.03 / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.32\n\nStep 3: Present the results in the required JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.04\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-1.04\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"22.30\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.05\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"15.14\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"15.32\"\n  }\n}",
