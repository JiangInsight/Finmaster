                        "content": "We need to calculate the following ratios using the information provided in the three financial statements. Let’s go through each step‐by‐step.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n• Formula: Operating Cash Flow ÷ Total Current Liabilities  \n• Operating Cash Flow (from cash flow statement – “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities”): –650630.22  \n• Current Liabilities (from balance sheet – “Total Current Liabilities” at end): 628478.02  \n• Calculation: –650630.22 ÷ 628478.02 ≈ –1.04\n\n2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n• Formula: Total Liabilities ÷ Total Owner’s Equity  \n• In this balance sheet, the only liability presented is the current liabilities, which is 628478.02.  \n• Total Owner’s Equity (from balance sheet – “Total Owner's Equity” at end): 13905750.76  \n• Calculation: 628478.02 ÷ 13905750.76 ≈ 0.0452, which rounds to 0.05\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n• Formula: Total Revenue ÷ Total Assets  \n• Total Revenue (from income statement): 2869560.42  \n• Total Assets (from balance sheet – “Total Assets” at end): 14534228.78  \n• Calculation: 2869560.42 ÷ 14534228.78 ≈ 0.1974, which rounds to 0.20\n\n4. Quick Ratio\n\n• Formula: (Current Assets – Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities  \n• Current Assets (from balance sheet – “Total Current Assets” at end): 9625738.03  \n• Inventory (from balance sheet): 112000.00  \n• Quick Assets = 9625738.03 – 112000.00 = 9513738.03  \n• Current Liabilities: 628478.02  \n• Calculation: 9513738.03 ÷ 628478.02 ≈ 15.15\n\n5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n• This ratio is calculated the same way as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.  \n• Thus, it is –650630.22 ÷ 628478.02 ≈ –1.04\n\n6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n\n• Formula: Net Profit ÷ Total Owner’s Equity  \n• Net Profit (from income statement): 905750.76  \n• Total Owner’s Equity (from balance sheet): 13905750.76  \n• Calculation: 905750.76 ÷ 13905750.76 ≈ 0.06515, which as a percentage is ≈ 6.52%\n\n7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n• The typical formula is: Accounts Receivable Turnover = Total Revenue ÷ Average Accounts Receivable.  \n• Accounts Receivable on the balance sheet increased from 0 (beginning) to 2149792.45 (end), so the average is: (0 + 2149792.45) ÷ 2 = 1074896.225  \n• Total Revenue: 2869560.42  \n• Calculation: 2869560.42 ÷ 1074896.225 ≈ 2.67\n\nNow we put all the results into the required JSON output format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.04\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.05\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.20\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"15.15\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.04\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"6.52%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.67\"\n  }\n}",
