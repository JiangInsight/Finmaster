This represents the net amount of cash used in the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets (and similar activities).\n\nStep 3: Decompose this net item into its component. In our cash flow statement, the only component provided is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an amount of 85889.19. Note that the net cash flow is negative (indicating a cash outflow), while the purchase item is given as a positive number.\n\nStep 4: Present the final answer in the requested JSON format.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-85889.19', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '85889.19'}}",
