Looking for \"costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers\":\n• In the provided income statement, the line “Selling Expenses” best corresponds to these costs.\n• Its value is 402699.98.\n\nStep 2. Next, we look for \"cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets\":\n• In the cash flow statement, the line “Purchase of Fixed Assets” indicates these cash outflows.\n• Its value is 85889.19.\n\nThus, the two extracted values are:\n• value1 (Selling Expenses): 402699.98\n• value2 (Purchase of Fixed Assets): 85889.19\n\nHence, the solution is:\n{\n  \"solution\": {'value1': '402699.98', 'value2': '85889.19'}\n}",
