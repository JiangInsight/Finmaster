This appears on the balance sheet in the “Paid-in Capital” row. Its End_amount is 13000000.00.\n\n• The profit (or loss) before deducting tax expense. In the income statement this is shown as “Profit Before Tax” with an Amount of 967117.02.\n\n• The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit. This is reflected as an increase in “Accounts Payable” on the balance sheet with an End_amount of 247000.00.\n\nFollowing the intended grouping order (capital contribution first, then profit before tax, then the addition related to accounts payable), we present the answer in the json format as follows:\n\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '967117.02', 'value3': '247000.00'}}",
