In the statement, this is the \"Depreciation\" line. Its value is 92870.67.\n\nStep 2: Identify the line item that represents the reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period. In the statement, this corresponds to \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\". Its value is -203000.00 (a negative value indicates a reduction).\n\nStep 3: Identify the line item that represents the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends. This corresponds to \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\". Its value is -85889.19.\n\nStep 4: Identify the line item that represents the net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period. This is given as \"Net Increase\". Its value is -1114264.74.\n\nThus, the solution JSON is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value1\": \"92870.67\",\n    \"value2\": \"-203000.00\",\n    \"value3\": \"-85889.19\",\n    \"value4\": \"-1114264.74\"\n  }\n}",
