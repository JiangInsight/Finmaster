                        "content": "We can “build” an income‐statement by looking only at the transactions that affect operating results. In our data the only rows that “flow through” the income statement are the sales (which “report” a “profit” already computed on the sale) and the “Expense”, “Depreciation” and “Interest Receivables” rows. (The “Purchase”, “Initial”, “Fixed Assets” and “Transfer” entries are balance‐sheet transactions and are not “closed” by the income statement.)\n\nOne acceptable method was to calculate\n\n  Net Profit = (sum of “profit” from all Sale rows + sum of “amount” from Interest Receivables – note that interest receivables appear as revenues)\n       – (sum of all “Expense” entries including Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Financial Expenses and Depreciation)\n\nBelow we show a “sketch” of how one can accumulate the values:\n • For each Sale transaction the “profit” field was already computed (for example, one sale shows 13728.16 – 5000.0 = 8728.16, another had for instance 2183.69 – 1000.0 = 1183.69, etc.). When you add up the “profit” amounts on all sale entries you get a total sale “profit” of about 1,622,011.03.\n • All “Interest Receivables” transactions (although some are “Unpaid”) are considered revenue. Their amounts when added up give about 15,023.57.\n • The “Expense” lines (for Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Financial Expenses, etc.) plus the “Depreciation” lines add up to about 669,917.60.\nThen, the net profit becomes\n\n  Net Profit = (1,622,011.03 + 15,023.57) – 669,917.60 ≈ 1,637,034.60 – 669,917.60 = 967,117.00\n\nWhen formatted as required, one acceptable answer is:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '967117.00'} } \n\nNote:\nThere are several “detailed” ways to arrive at the result; here we have carefully “aggregated” only the flows that belong on the income statement (sales, interest income, expenses and depreciation) while leaving out balance‐sheet effects.",
