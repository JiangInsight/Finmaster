Then later (on the same day) a fixed asset purchase transaction is recorded – with a row that has type “Fixed Assets Purchase” and an amount of 85,889.19. (In the sample set, a similar purchase increased the asset account.) \n\nSince the task does not require subtracting depreciation from the “fixed assets” cost (the sample solution did not subtract the depreciation either), we simply update the fixed asset balance by adding the fixed asset purchase amount to the initial value.\n\nThus, the ending fixed assets = 5,000,000.00 + 85,889.19 = 5,085,889.19.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"5085889.19\"\n  }\n}",
