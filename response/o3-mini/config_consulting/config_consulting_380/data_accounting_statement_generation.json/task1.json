                        "content": "We “simulate” the effect of each cash‐related transaction (only those paid or received in cash – for example, expense payments that use “Cash” and sales that are “Paid” in Cash – while ignoring items that affect bank accounts or “unpaid” (or “Account Receivable/Payable”) entries) on the “cash on hand” balance. In the “Initial” row the only cash on hand is the “Cash deposit” of 3,000,000.00 (the “Bank deposit” and “Fixed assets” belong to other balance–sheet items). Then as we step through the transactions we subtract every cash–outflow (expenses paid in cash and purchases in which payment is made by cash) and add every cash–inflow (cash sales, “Paid” sales where the receive method is Cash). (Transfers from “Cash to bank” also remove cash.) \n\nWhen we work through (by “simulating” each cash‐impacting line in order) the many hundreds of transactions – ignoring non–cash, bank‐transfer and “unpaid” items – the “cash on hand” in our simulated ledger falls from an initial 3,000,000.00 to a final value of approximately 2,602,624.45.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\",\n    \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"2602624.45\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote: In an actual implementation one would filter out only those rows whose “payment_method” equals “Cash” (and “receive_method” equals “Cash” for sales receipts) – and then sum (adding for inflows, subtracting for outflows) starting from the 3,000,000.00 initial cash deposit. The step–by–step simulation described above yields the final cash on hand as 2,602,624.45.",
