In our table only those rows whose “type” is “Sale” count for revenue.\n\nFor example, let’s review the process step‐by‐step:\n\n1. Scan the provided rows and list only those rows whose “type” is “Sale”. (In our table these rows are numbered by a Sale… id.)\n\n2. For each sale row, read its “after_tax_amount” value. (This is the amount the business receives from sales after deducting sales taxes, etc.) For our data the selected rows and values are:\n\n  • Sale20240102003: 13,041.75  \n  • Sale20240103005: 10,798.85  \n  • Sale20240104007: 11,847.10  \n  • Sale20240104008: 9,854.18  \n  • Sale20240104009: 2,183.69?  \n   [In our table the “Sale20240104009” row shows an after‐tax amount of 2,074.51; note that we use the provided “after_tax_amount” column.]\n\n  • Sale20240111017: 55,649.81  \n  • Sale20240112018: 278,523.24  \n  • Sale20240112019: 55,873.75  \n  • Sale20240113021: 10,198.91  \n  • Sale20240113022: 52,930.29  \n  • Sale20240113023: 13,383.30  \n  • Sale20240114024: 14,108.35  \n  • Sale20240114025: 44,972.33  \n  • Sale20240115027: 256,778.13  \n  • Sale20240115028: 40,117.65  \n  • Sale20240131059: 2,815.99  \n  • Sale20240131060: 45,049.57  \n  • Sale20240201062: 12,451.69  \n  • Sale20240201063: 1,724.46  \n  • Sale20240202065: 13,853.56  \n  • Sale20240203068: 214,382.65  \n  • Sale20240203069: 1,821.26  \n  • Sale20240205072: 9,164.30  \n  • Sale20240205073: 10,586.27\n\n3. Now add them together. (One way is to break the sum into smaller groups so that errors are minimized.)\n\nFor instance, one may group as follows:\n\n• Rows 1–5 sum to about 47,616.39  \n• Rows 6–10 sum to about 453,176.00  \n  Subtotal so far: 47,616.39 + 453,176.00 = 500,792.39  \n• Rows 11–15 sum to about 369,359.76  \n  Subtotal becomes 500,792.39 + 369,359.76 = 870,152.15  \n• Rows 16–20 sum to about 75,895.27  \n  Subtotal becomes 870,152.15 + 75,895.27 = 946,047.42  \n• Finally, rows 21–24 add up to 235,954.48  \n  Grand total = 946,047.42 + 235,954.48 = 1,182,001.90\n\nThus, the total “after_tax_amount” coming from all the Sale transactions is 1,182,001.90.\n\nWe then conclude that the “Main Business Revenue” item in the income statement is 1,182,001.90.\n\nBelow is our final answer in the required JSON format.\n\n \n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Main Business Revenue\": \"1182001.90\"\n  }\n}",
