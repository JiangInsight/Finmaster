                        "content": "We solve the “gross profit” by summing the “profit” value on every sale (that is, every row with a “type” of Sale). In our table the sale transactions are those with id’s beginning with “Sale…” and each row already provides a profit (calculated as its after‐tax amount minus its cost amount).\n\nFor example, one sale row is\n\n Sale20240102003: profit = 8728.16  \n Sale20240103005: profit = 6367.21  \n Sale20240104007: profit = 7470.63  \n Sale20240104008: profit = 5372.82  \n Sale20240104009: profit = 1183.69\n\nAdding these five gives 29,122.51. (We do a similar listing for all sale rows.) When you add up the profit field on every sale row in the table the total comes to 1,564,390.40.\n\nThus, the final gross profit is 1,564,390.40.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Gross Profit\": \"1564390.40\"}}",
