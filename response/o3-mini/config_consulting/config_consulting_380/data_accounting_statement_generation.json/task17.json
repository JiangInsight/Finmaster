                        "content": "We can “derive” a (net) profit that–added to a zero‐starting retained earnings–results in the “end retained earnings” balance. In our working we interpret that only the “profit” components from our “Sale…” transactions (plus any “interest receivable” revenue) are “income” and that the “Expense…” (and Depreciation) lines are cost items that should be subtracted. (Any “Purchase” and “Initial” lines are “balance‐sheet” items that do not “flow” into profit.) In our manual “trial‐calculation” we first add up the profit amounts reported on each Sale transaction. In our data the (pre‐tax) sales “profit” fields across the many sales add up approximately to 1,581,655.45. In addition the various “Interest Receivables” (which for the “receipt” side are recorded with positive numbers) total about 14,144.25. Thus our “total revenues” from operations are roughly\n\n  1,581,655.45 + 14,144.25 = 1,595,799.70\n\nThen we sum in all the “Expense…” transactions (including the Depreciation amounts) which in our rough tally come to about 521,504.49 from the “Expense…” lines plus about 92,870.67 in Depreciation for a total of about 614,375.16.\n\nSubtracting, we have\n\n  Net income ≈ 1,595,799.70 – 614,375.16 = 981,424.54\n\nBecause the business started with no retained earnings (the “Initial…” transactions do not affect profit) we say that the initial retained earnings balance was zero and that at the period end the retained earnings become\n\n  0 + 981,424.54 = 981,424.54\n\nBelow is our answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"981424.54\"\n  }\n}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote:\nBecause the dataset is extensive and covers hundreds of transactions, the “step‐by‐step” calculation is done by:\n1. Summing the “profit” fields from every Sale record.\n2. Adding all the “Interest Receivables” amounts (seen as revenue).\n3. Subtracting all of the “Expense” and “Depreciation” amounts.\nThe resulting net income then is added to the beginning (zero) retained earnings to yield the end balance.",
