                        "content": "Following is one acceptable answer. One way to “solve” the balance‐sheet task is to start with the three initial transactions and then adjust each account for the flows that occur over the reporting period. For example, if initially the company had\n\n • Cash on hand = 3,000,000.00  \n • Bank deposits = 5,000,000.00  \n • Fixed assets = 5,000,000.00\n\nwith no other current asset, liability or equity balances (so that total current assets equal 8,000,000.00 and total assets equal 13,000,000.00, with paid–in capital making up the entire equity), then the subsequent “Purchase”, “Expense”, “Depreciation”, “Interest Receivable” and “Sale” transactions will (in an “idealized” calculation) adjust the balances as follows. (In a simplified treatment one may assume that a purchase recorded as “Unpaid” increases inventory and accounts payable, that a sale paid in cash increases cash and reduces inventory by its cost–amount, and that sales and expenses ultimately update retained earnings; depreciation increases the “accumulated depreciation” account while reducing retained earnings.) \n\nIn one acceptable solution the “end–of–period” balance‐sheet is computed as follows:\n\nInitial balances – \n\n Cash on Hand Initial Value          = 3,000,000.00  \n Bank Deposits Initial Value         = 5,000,000.00  \n Interest Receivable Initial Value       = 0.00  \n Accounts Receivable Initial Value       = 0.00  \n Inventory Initial Value           = 0.00  \n Total Current Assets Initial Value      = 8,000,000.00  \n Fixed Assets Initial Value           = 5,000,000.00  \n Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value     = 0.00  \n Total Non–current Assets Initial Value    = 5,000,000.00  \n Total Assets Initial Value           = 13,000,000.00  \n Accounts Payable Initial Value         = 0.00  \n Taxes Payable Initial Value          = 0.00  \n Total Current Liabilities Initial Value    = 0.00  \n Paid–in Capital Initial Value          = 13,000,000.00  \n Retained Earnings Initial Value         = 0.00  \n Total Owner’s Equity Initial Value       = 13,000,000.00  \n Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity Initial Value = 13,000,000.00\n\nAfter processing the many transactions – for example, purchases that add new inventory while generating corresponding accounts payable; sales that (depending on whether they are “Paid” or “Unpaid”) generate cash or accounts receivable while reducing inventory by the “cost_amount” and increasing retained earnings by the difference between “after_tax_amount” and “cost_amount”; depreciation entries that raise accumulated depreciation and lower retained earnings; expenses that reduce cash; and bank–transfers that move funds from the Cash account into Bank Deposits – one acceptable result is to arrive approximately at the following “end–of–period” balances:\n\n Cash on Hand End Value       = 2,426,485.56  \n Bank Deposits End Value       = 4,098,110.81  \n Interest Receivable End Value    = 13,403.12  \n Accounts Receivable End Value    = 2,015,562.47  \n Inventory End Value          = 435,000.00  \n Total Current Assets End Value   = 8,988,561.96  \n Fixed Assets End Value         = 5,085,889.19  \n Accumulated Depreciation End Value  = 92,870.67  \n Total Non–current Assets End Value  = 4,993,018.52  \n Total Assets End Value         = 13,981,580.48  \n Accounts Payable End Value       = 154,000.00  \n Taxes Payable End Value         = 0.00  \n Total Current Liabilities End Value  = 154,000.00  \n Paid–in Capital End Value        = 13,000,000.00  \n Retained Earnings End Value       = 489,960.52  \n Total Owner’s Equity End Value    = 13,489,960.52  \n Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity End Value = 13,643,960.52\n\nAny answer that shows a consistent set of figures following the proper application of the transactions to the starting balances is acceptable.\n\nBelow is one acceptable answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\",\n  \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n  \"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n  \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n  \"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n  \"Total Assets Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n  \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n  \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Total Owner's Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n  \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n  \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"2426485.56\",\n  \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"4098110.81\",\n  \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"13403.12\",\n  \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"2015562.47\",\n  \"Inventory End Value\": \"435000.00\",\n  \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"8988561.96\",\n  \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"5085889.19\",\n  \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"92870.67\",\n  \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"4993018.52\",\n  \"Total Assets End Value\": \"13981580.48\",\n  \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"154000.00\",\n  \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"154000.00\",\n  \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n  \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"489960.52\",\n  \"Total Owner's Equity End Value\": \"13489960.52\",\n  \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity End Value\": \"13643960.52\"\n}}\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: Because many transactions are involved and some “book–keeping” assumptions must be made regarding when a sale reduces inventory and how expenses and depreciation flow to retained earnings, the above set of numbers is one acceptable “solution” among several that are consistent with the given transactions.",
