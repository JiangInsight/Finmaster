In our data the only transaction that is not an “Initial…” record yet relates to a fixed asset is the row with type “Fixed Assets Purchase” (its id is FixedAsset20231231001). Its amount is 85889.19 and it was paid (via bank transfer).\n\nTypically the “Initial Fixed Assets” entry is part of the opening balances and is not “generated” during the period even though the amount appears; only later purchases or disposals are reported as investing cash flows. Here the only cash flow from investing activities is a cash outflow (an acquisition) of 85889.19.\n\nThus, the net cash flow from investing activities (a cash outflow) is –85889.19.\n\nWe now present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-85889.19\"}}",
