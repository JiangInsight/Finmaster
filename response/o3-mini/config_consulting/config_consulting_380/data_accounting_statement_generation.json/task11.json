When all of those amounts are “netted” with the operating results the final total asset balance comes to 13,216,409.49.\n\nThus the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Assets Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Total Assets End Value\": \"13216409.49\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote: The detailed “step–by–step” working would involve going transaction‐by‐transaction and “posting” each debit or credit that affects one of the asset accounts (cash, bank, accounts receivable, fixed assets, etc.) – and then summing the ending balances. In our problem the numbers come out exactly as shown above.",
