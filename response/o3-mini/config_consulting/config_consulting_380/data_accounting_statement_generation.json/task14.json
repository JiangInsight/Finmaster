                        "content": "We need to extract the transactions that increase “current liabilities.” In our bookkeeping system only obligations recorded as “Purchase” entries that remain “Unpaid” (with a payment method of “Account Payable”) are recorded as current liabilities. (Other “Initial” or “Expense” entries – even if “Unpaid” in the case of interest receivables or sales – affect other balance‐sheet categories such as receivables rather than liabilities.) \n\nStep 1. Look at every “Purchase” transaction and select those whose “payment/receipt_status” is “Unpaid” and whose “payment_method” is “Account Payable.” In our data these rows are:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001 – amount = 10,000.00  \n2. Purchase20231231002 – amount = 10,000.00  \n3. Purchase20231231003 – amount = 1,000.00  \n4. Purchase20231231004 – amount = 40,000.00  \n5. Purchase20231231005 – amount = 5,000.00  \n6. Purchase20231231007 – amount = 15,000.00  \n7. Purchase20231231013 – amount = 2,000.00  \n8. Purchase20231231014 – amount = 20,000.00  \n9. Purchase20231231015 – amount = 20,000.00  \n10. Purchase20231231017 – amount = 2,000.00  \n11. Purchase20231231020 – amount = 1,000.00  \n12. Purchase20231231021 – amount = 1,000.00  \n13. Purchase20231231024 – amount = 20,000.00  \n14. Purchase20231231026 – amount = 100,000.00\n\nStep 2. Sum these amounts to compute the ending liability balance:\n  10,000 + 10,000 = 20,000  \n  20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000  \n  21,000 + 40,000 = 61,000  \n  61,000 + 5,000 = 66,000  \n  66,000 + 15,000 = 81,000  \n  81,000 + 2,000 = 83,000  \n  83,000 + 20,000 = 103,000  \n  103,000 + 20,000 = 123,000  \n  123,000 + 2,000 = 125,000  \n  125,000 + 1,000 = 126,000  \n  126,000 + 1,000 = 127,000  \n  127,000 + 20,000 = 147,000  \n  147,000 + 100,000 = 247,000\n\nStep 3. At the beginning of the period (initial date) no current liabilities are recorded (the “Initial” transactions only reflected assets and fixed asset purchases). Thus the beginning (or “initial”) current liabilities balance is 0.00.\n\nTherefore the results are as follows:\n\n• Total Current Liabilities Initial Value: 0.00  \n• Total Current Liabilities End Value: 247,000.00\n\nBelow is our answer formatted in the required JSON output:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"247000.00\"\n  }\n}",
