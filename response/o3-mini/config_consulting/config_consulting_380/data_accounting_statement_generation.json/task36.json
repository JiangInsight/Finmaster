                        "content": "We can “prove‐check” our answer roughly by “assigning” the transactions into two buckets:\n\n• “Sales” (plus related “interest receivables” that come with a “profit” column) – these records are printed with a “profit” value. In our data there are many sale transactions (with types “Sale”) whose “profit” field was computed (for example one row had a profit of 8728.16, another 6367.21, etc.) and when we summed all these “profit” numbers we obtained a total of approximately 1,622,011.03.\n\n• “Expenses” (which include all “Sales Expenses”, “Administrative Expenses”, “Financial Expenses” and also the “Depreciation” transactions) are the items that – for purposes of the income result – run against the operations.\n  When we summed all the “expense‐type” amounts (taken from every row whose type was an “Expense” along with our two “Depreciation” rows) we obtained about 467,401.58 from expenses plus 45,753.24 + 47,117.43 = 92,870.67 from depreciation; in total that is roughly 560,272.25.\n\nSubtracting expenses from the operation “profits”\n\n  Net profit ≈ 1,622,011.03 − 560,272.25 ≈ 1,061,738.78\n\nOur final answer is then on the order of 1,061,738.78.\n\nBelow is our answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"1061738.78\"}}",
