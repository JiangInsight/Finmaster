                        "content": "We need to “build” an income‐statement number that reflects the results of all the revenue‐relevant transactions (mostly “Sale” rows, whose “profit” has been calculated as “after tax amount” less “cost amount”) plus any “other income” (here the “Interest Receivables” show amounts coming in) minus all the “expense” charges (which include all “Expense” rows and also depreciation, which is a noncash operating charge).\n\nOne way to “reconstruct” the result is to follow these steps:\n\n1. First, add up the “profit” figures that were generated on the Sale transactions. (In our data each “Sale” row shows a “profit” amount equal to sale revenue minus its cost amount.) In our working the 42 Sale‐transactions when added together yielded about \n  1,622,011.03\n\n2. Then, add up all “other revenue” items – here the “Interest Receivables” showing up (even though they are “unpaid” sometimes, they are “receivable” items and count as income in the P&L). In our working there were 36 interest lines which (when added) yield about \n  15,023.57\n\n3. Next, add up all “expense” items – the explicit expense rows covering Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Financial Expenses. In our working all Expense rows (when summed) came to about \n  514,628.38 \n\n4. Also, depreciation is charged as an expense. In our data there are two Depreciation rows which sum to \n  45,753.24 + 47,117.43 = 92,870.67\n\n5. So total expense charge is \n  514,628.38 + 92,870.67 = 607,499.05\n\n6. Finally the “Profit Before Tax” is computed as:\n  (Sales profit + Interest income) – (Expenses + Depreciation)\n  = (1,622,011.03 + 15,023.57) – 607,499.05\n  = 1,637,034.60 – 607,499.05\n  ≈ 1,029,535.55\n\nThus our final calculated “Profit Before Tax” is about 1,029,535.55.\n\nWhen we answer below in the required json format we write:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Profit Before Tax\": \"1029535.55\"}}\n\nNote: (Because of rounding the numbers are approximate.)",
