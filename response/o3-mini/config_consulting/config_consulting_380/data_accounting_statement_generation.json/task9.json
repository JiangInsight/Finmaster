When a company buys additional fixed assets the “asset purchase” transaction (often recorded in a “Fixed Assets Purchase” type) would add to the balance, and depreciation decreases the balance.\n\nIn this data set no “Fixed Assets Purchase” transaction appears (only “Purchase” entries for services or consulting, not for fixed‐asset items). However, we do see depreciation postings. In our case there are two depreciation entries:\n • Depreciation20240101001 with an amount of 45,753.240000000005  \n • Depreciation20240201002 with an amount of 47,117.43\n\nTheir sum is:\n 45,753.24 + 47,117.43 = 92,870.67\n\nThus, the net fixed assets at end of period is computed by taking the initial fixed assets and then subtracting the total depreciation applied:\n 5,000,000.00 – 92,870.67 = 4,907,129.33\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'fixed assets net Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'fixed assets net End Value': '4907129.33'}}",
