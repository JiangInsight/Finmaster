                        "content": "We have to “build” the balance‐sheet “Accounts Payable” using the purchase transactions that were recorded as “Unpaid” with the payment method “Account Payable.” In our data no beginning balance shows up with Account Payable (the “Initial…” rows are simply cash, bank and fixed asset amounts). Therefore the initial value is zero. Then we need to scan through all transactions of type “Purchase” (only those that are “Unpaid” and with a payment method “Account Payable” are recorded as liabilities).\n\nBelow is a brief walk‐through (note that we ignore “Paid” purchases because that liability has been settled):\n\n1. Purchase20231231001 → amount = 10,000.0 (Unpaid, payment method Account Payable)\n2. Purchase20231231002 → amount = 10,000.0 (Unpaid)\n3. Purchase20231231003 → amount = 1,000.0 (Unpaid)\n4. Purchase20231231004 → amount = 40,000.0 (Unpaid)\n5. Purchase20231231005 → amount = 5,000.0 (Unpaid)\n6. Purchase20231231007 → amount = 15,000.0 (Unpaid)\n7. Purchase20231231013 → amount = 2,000.0 (Unpaid)\n8. Purchase20231231014 → amount = 20,000.0 (Unpaid)\n9. Purchase20231231015 → amount = 20,000.0 (Unpaid)\n10. Purchase20231231017 → amount = 2,000.0 (Unpaid)\n11. Purchase20231231020 → amount = 1,000.0 (Unpaid)\n12. Purchase20231231021 → amount = 1,000.0 (Unpaid)\n13. Purchase20231231024 → amount = 20,000.0 (Unpaid)\n\nSumming these amounts we get:\n  10,000 + 10,000 = 20,000  \n  20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000  \n  21,000 + 40,000 = 61,000  \n  61,000 + 5,000 = 66,000  \n  66,000 + 15,000 = 81,000  \n  81,000 + 2,000 = 83,000  \n  83,000 + 20,000 = 103,000  \n  103,000 + 20,000 = 123,000  \n  123,000 + 2,000 = 125,000  \n  125,000 + 1,000 = 126,000  \n  126,000 + 1,000 = 127,000  \n  127,000 + 20,000 = 147,000\n\nThus in the balance sheet the Accounts Payable “end value” equals 147,000 while the beginning value is zero.\n\nThe final answer in the required JSON format is as follows:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"147000.00\"\n  }\n}",
