Then estimated changes in current assets (accounts receivable and interest receivable) and current liabilities (accounts payable) were determined and added (or subtracted) along with the non–cash depreciation charge. Finally the net cash (operating plus investing) change was applied to the beginning balance (the sum of the initial cash deposit and bank deposit of 8 000 000.00) to yield the ending balance.
