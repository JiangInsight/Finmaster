                        "content": "We must “derive” the ending liability balance that appears on the balance sheet (and so the “change” in Accounts Payable from a zero beginning balance) by summing up all purchase‐transactions that create an accounts payable liability. In our data these are the rows with type “Purchase” that list “Account Payable” in their Payment Method and are still “Unpaid.” (For a cash flow statement the “Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable” is computed as ending AP less beginning AP. Here the beginning was zero.) \n\nLet’s list those rows and their amounts:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001: 10,000.00  \n2. Purchase20231231002: 10,000.00  \n3. Purchase20231231003: 1,000.00  \n4. Purchase20231231004: 40,000.00  \n5. Purchase20231231005: 5,000.00  \n6. Purchase20231231007: 15,000.00  \n7. Purchase20231231013: 2,000.00  \n8. Purchase20231231014: 20,000.00  \n9. Purchase20231231015: 20,000.00  \n10. Purchase20231231017: 2,000.00  \n11. Purchase20231231020: 1,000.00  \n12. Purchase20231231021: 1,000.00  \n13. Purchase20231231024: 20,000.00  \n14. Purchase20231231026: 100,000.00  \n\nNow, summing these amounts:\n  10,000 + 10,000 = 20,000  \n  20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000  \n  21,000 + 40,000 = 61,000  \n  61,000 + 5,000 = 66,000  \n  66,000 + 15,000 = 81,000  \n  81,000 + 2,000 = 83,000  \n  83,000 + 20,000 = 103,000  \n  103,000 + 20,000 = 123,000  \n  123,000 + 2,000 = 125,000  \n  125,000 + 1,000 = 126,000  \n  126,000 + 1,000 = 127,000  \n  127,000 + 20,000 = 147,000  \n  147,000 + 100,000 = 247,000  \n\nThus the ending (and increase) in Accounts Payable is 247,000.00.\n\nWe therefore answer:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"247000.00\"\n  }\n}",
