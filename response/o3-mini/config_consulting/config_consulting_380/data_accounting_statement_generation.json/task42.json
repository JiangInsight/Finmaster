                        "content": "We need to “recover” the tax‐related part of the cash‐flow statement by figuring out, for the period covered by the data, what is the net “tax payable” – i.e. the new (increased) amount (or reduction) in tax liability. In our transactions the only numbers that look “tax‐related” are those recorded in the tax_amount field on our “Sale” transactions (for example, every sale row has a tax_amount value that was collected from the customer). Although in a full “tax‐computation” many “input taxes” would be recovered through purchases and other expenses, in this data only the sales have a tax_amount value. (The “Purchase” rows do not have any tax number.) Thus, for our purpose we sum all the tax_amount values from the “Sale” records to determine the change in the tax‐payable liability.\n\nThe step‐by‐step process is as follows:\n\n1. Look at each row that is of type “Sale” and note its tax_amount.\n2. For example (showing selected rows – the table below contains many sales):\n  • Sale20240102003: tax_amount = 686.41  \n  • Sale20240103005: tax_amount = 568.36  \n  • Sale20240104007: 623.53  \n  • Sale20240104008: 518.64  \n  • Sale20240104009: 109.18  \n  • Sale20240108013: 2717.78  \n  • Sale20240111017: 2928.94  \n  • Sale20240112018: 14659.12  \n  • Sale20240112019: 2940.72  \n  • … and so on.\n3. (Listing every row from the data that has a tax_amount – there are 41 sale records with a tax_amount value.)\n4. When you add these all up (the “running sum” computed step‐by‐step is shown below) you get a total tax collected of 131850.51 over the period.\n  – 686.41 + 568.36 = 1254.77  \n  – 1254.77 + 623.53 = 1878.30  \n  – 1878.30 + 518.64 = 2396.94  \n  – 2396.94 + 109.18 = 2506.12  \n  – 2506.12 + 2717.78 = 5223.90  \n  – 5223.90 + 2928.94 = 8152.84  \n  – 8152.84 + 14659.12 = 22811.96  \n  – 22811.96 + 2940.72 = 25752.68  \n  – 25752.68 + 568.36 = 26289.46  \n  – 26289.46 + 2785.80 = 29075.26  \n  – 29075.26 + 704.38 = 29779.64  \n  – 29779.64 + 742.54 = 30522.18  \n  – 30522.18 + 2366.96 = 32889.14  \n  – 32889.14 + 13514.64 = 46403.78  \n  – 46403.78 + 2111.45 = 48515.23  \n  – 48515.23 + 14006.59 = 62521.82  \n  – 62521.82 + 543.34 = 63065.16  \n  – 63065.16 + 640.40 = 63705.56  \n  – 63705.56 + 92.18 = 63797.74  \n  – 63797.74 + 109.89 = 63907.63  \n  – 63907.63 + 9670.08 = 73577.71  \n  – 73577.71 + 13658.45 = 87236.16  \n  – 87236.16 + 2113.25 = 89349.41  \n  – 89349.41 + 2923.47 = 92272.88  \n  – 92272.88 + 14929.01 = 107201.89  \n  – 107201.89 + 108.63 = 107310.52  \n  – 107310.52 + 2181.02 = 109491.54  \n  – 109491.54 + 2936.67 = 112428.21  \n  – 112428.21 + 2663.00 = 115091.21  \n  – 115091.21 + 103.48 = 115194.69  \n  – 115194.69 + 106.37 = 115301.06  \n  – 115301.06 + 136.30 = 115437.36  \n  – 115437.36 + 148.21 = 115585.57  \n  – 115585.57 + 2371.03 = 117956.60  \n  – 117956.60 + 655.35 = 118611.95  \n  – 118611.95 + 90.76 = 118702.71  \n  – 118702.71 + 729.14 = 119431.85  \n  – 119431.85 + 11283.30 = 130715.15  \n  – 130715.15 + 95.86 = 130811.01  \n  – 130811.01 + 482.33 = 131293.34  \n  – 131293.34 + 557.17 = 131850.51\n5. Since no other transactions carried a tax adjustment (purchases did not include a separate “tax_amount”) the net increase in the tax‐payable account is simply this sum.\n\nTherefore, the final “Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable” item for the cash-flow statement is 131850.51.\n\nWe now present the answer in the required json format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"131850.51\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis is our final answer based on summing all the tax_amount values of the sales records in the provided transaction data.",
