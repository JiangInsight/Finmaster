                        "content": "We need to “build” the inventory number from the transactions that affect inventory. (That is, we want to determine by how much the inventory balance has changed over the period.) In most operating‐cash–flow schedules the “change in inventory” is computed as\n\n  (net purchases) – (cost of goods sold)\n\nusing only the transactions that “add” inventory (purchases) and those that “remove” inventory (sales, via their cost amounts). (An increase in inventory uses cash so it is reported as a negative change, while a decrease “releases” cash and is reported as a plus.)\n\nStep 1. Identify the purchase transactions that add to inventory. In our “problem to solve” table there are many Purchase rows. (For example, the very first purchase “Purchase20231231001” has an amount of 10,000; the next “Purchase20231231003” has 1,000; etc.) Adding together all the purchase amounts–which are taken at cost–we obtain a total purchase cost of 1,213,000.00. (In other words, the sum of every “Purchase …” row’s amount is 1,213,000.00.)\n\nStep 2. Identify the sale transactions that remove inventory. (When goods sell the “cost_amount” is expended; these sale rows carry a “cost_amount” value.) If you add together all the “Sale …” rows’ cost_amount fields you get a total cost of goods sold (COGS) equal to 995,000.00.\n\nStep 3. Compute the net change (for the reporting period the beginning inventory is assumed zero). Thus the net inventory increase is\n\n  Total Purchases – COGS = 1,213,000.00 – 995,000.00 = 218,000.00.\n\nSince an increase in inventory consumes cash the cash flow statement shows this as a “use” of cash. (That is, when inventory increases the change is “−218,000.00”.)\n\nThus the final inventory change (“(Increase) Decrease in Inventory”) to report is –218,000.00.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is therefore:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-218000.00\"\n  }\n}",
