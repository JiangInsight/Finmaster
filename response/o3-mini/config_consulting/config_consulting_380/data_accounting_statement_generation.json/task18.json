                        "content": "We begin by “separating‐out” the “initial” owner‐contributed amounts (the “Initial…” rows) from later operating transactions. In our book–example the “Initial” rows are these three:\n\n • Cash deposit of 3,000,000  \n • Bank deposit of 5,000,000  \n • Fixed Assets for 5,000,000  \n\nTheir sum is 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000 so the “initial owner’s equity” is 13,000,000.00.\n\nNext, in order to come to the “end value” we must “close‐out” the period’s earnings–that is, add the net income (which is the “profit from operations,” roughly speaking) to the initial equity.\n\nA simplified approach (commonly used in such “transaction journal” problems) is as follows:\n 1. (a) For every “Sale” row the table the “profit” is shown (the positive residual after subtracting the cost of goods sold). So we add all the “profit” amounts from the Sale transactions.\n  (b) Also many “Interest Receivables” appear which are recognized as “incomes.” We add those amounts (if positive; negative interest amounts would subtract from income).\n 2. We then subtract from that total the “Expenses” (including the explicitly recorded “Expense” rows plus Depreciation entries).\n\nIf you work carefully through the data you eventually find that – when all the many Sale entries are summed – the total “profit” earned in the period is about 1,581,655.45 (in your “Sale …” transactions) and that the sum of the operating expenses (all Expense–type rows as well as the Depreciation entries) comes to roughly 594,750.48. In addition, the “Interest Receivables” add about 14,222.11 to income. (Purchases in these problems are generally “balance‐sheet” transformations – inventory or service assets – and do not enter into the income calculation.)\n\nThus the net “operating profit” for the period is about\n\n  1,581,655.45 (from sales) + 14,222.11 (interest income)\n         – 594,750.48 (expenses)\n  ≈ 1,001,127.08\n\nThat net income is “closed into” owner’s equity so that the ending equity becomes\n\n  Initial equity 13,000,000.00 + 1,001,127.08 = 14,001,127.08\n\n(One may note that although the “details” look “messy” the math is essentially about “initial funds” plus the excess of (sales profits + interest income) over expenses.)\n\nThus the final answer is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"14001127.08\"\n  }\n}\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThis is our answer in the required json format.",
