                        "content": "We can “build” an income‐statement by looking only at the “business–related” transactions. In our example the only “revenue” comes from sales (with an “after_tax_amount” recorded on each sale) while the cost of each sale is stored in its “cost_amount” field. Then the “gross profit” is simply the “total sales” minus the sum of cost amounts aggregated over sales.\n  \nLikewise, many “expense” transactions appear with a sub–type (for example, “Sales Expenses” are sometimes called “selling expenses”, and “Administrative Expenses” are reported separately; depreciation (a noncash cost) and “Financial Expenses” are also recorded). Finally, several “Interest Receivables” appear that we treat as “interest income.” (In a real company any tax calculation would be done separately; here no tax charge was recorded so we assume it is nil.) \n\nBelow is a rough outline of the “reasoning” we used. (Because the data sample is long we list only a short summary of the method – each row was “typed” as follows.)\n\n1. Sales (the “Sale…” type)  \n – We added together the “after_tax_amount” for every sale transaction to get the “Main Business Revenue” (and – by our definition – “Total Revenue”). In our data the sum came to  \n  Total sale revenue = 2,452,522.72  \n2. Cost of Goods Sold  \n – For every sale row the “cost_amount” was given. (For example, a sale with 5,000 cost was recorded as such.) When we add all the “cost_amount”–numbers for sale rows we obtain  \n  Total COGS = 995,000.00  \n – Therefore gross profit = 2,452,522.72 – 995,000.00 = 1,457,522.72  \n3. Operating expenses  \n – The “Expense…” transactions come in different “flavors.” We grouped them as follows:\n  a. Selling expenses (all “Sales Expenses”) summed up to about 374,782.97  \n  b. Administrative expenses (all “Administrative Expenses”) summed to about 136,536.97  \n  c. Depreciation (the two depreciation transactions) totaled 45,753.24 + 47,117.43 = 92,870.67  \n  d. Financial expenses (the “Financial Expenses” rows) summed to 25,594.85  \n – Adding these we obtain:  \n  Total operating expenses = 136,536.97 + 374,782.97 + 92,870.67 + 25,594.85 = 629,785.46  \n4. Interest income  \n – A large number of “Interest Receivables” appear (all recorded on “Unpaid” basis). Their amounts (which are around 400–445 per row) add up to about 15,023.57  \n5. Finally, Profit Before Tax is computed as:  \n  Gross Profit – (total operating expense) + (interest income)  \n  = 1,457,522.72 – 629,785.46 + 15,023.57  \n  = 842,760.83  \n6. No tax expense is recorded so we assume Tax Expense = 0, and then Net Profit = Profit Before Tax.\n\nThus the complete income statement figure we obtain is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"Main Business Revenue\": \"2452522.72\",\n  \"Total Revenue\": \"2452522.72\",\n  \"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"995000.00\",\n  \"Total Cost\": \"995000.00\",\n  \"Gross Profit\": \"1457522.72\",\n  \"Administrative Expenses\": \"136536.97\",\n  \"Selling Expenses\": \"374782.97\",\n  \"Depreciation\": \"92870.67\",\n  \"Financial Expenses\": \"25594.85\",\n  \"Total Expenses\": \"629785.46\",\n  \"Interest Income\": \"15023.57\",\n  \"Profit Before Tax\": \"842760.83\",\n  \"Tax Expense\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Net Profit\": \"842760.83\"\n}\n\nBelow is the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Main Business Revenue\": \"2452522.72\", \"Total Revenue\": \"2452522.72\", \"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"995000.00\", \"Total Cost\": \"995000.00\", \"Gross Profit\": \"1457522.72\", \"Administrative Expenses\": \"136536.97\", \"Selling Expenses\": \"374782.97\", \"Depreciation\": \"92870.67\", \"Financial Expenses\": \"25594.85\", \"Total Expenses\": \"629785.46\", \"Interest Income\": \"15023.57\", \"Profit Before Tax\": \"842760.83\", \"Tax Expense\": \"0.00\", \"Net Profit\": \"842760.83\"} }\n```\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: In practice the “exact” numbers depend on which transactions are allocated to which category and on rounding. Here we have carefully added the “after_tax_amount” for sales, the “cost_amount” for each sale, and summed separately the expense items and the many small interest‐income items.",
