                        "content": "We need to “build” the non‐current asset balance by starting from the “Fixed Assets” that were recorded on the initial date and then “adjust” that balance by additions (if any) and by subtracting accumulated depreciation during the period. In our case the only explicit non‐current asset starting balance is given on 2023‑12‑31 under “Fixed Assets” (amount = 5,000,000.00). None of the other transaction rows show a purchase that is clearly recorded as adding to the “property, plant and equipment” (for example, by carrying an “asset_name” and “asset_type”) so we assume no additions. However, we do see depreciation transactions that lower the book value of the fixed assets. In our data there are two depreciation transactions:\n\n• Depreciation20240101001 of 45,753.24 (approximately)\n• Depreciation20240201002 of 47,117.43\n\nThe sum of depreciation is:\n  45,753.24 + 47,117.43 = 92,870.67\n\nThen the ending (net) value of the non‐current assets is computed by:\n  Ending value = Initial value + Additions – Depreciation\nSince there are no additions, we have:\n  Ending value = 5,000,000.00 – 92,870.67 = 4,907,129.33\n\nThus the solution is as follows.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"4907129.33\"\n  }\n}",
