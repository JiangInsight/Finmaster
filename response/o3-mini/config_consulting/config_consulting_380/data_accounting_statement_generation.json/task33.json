One way to “compute the final tax expense” is to sum the tax_amount values from every sales transaction.\n\nStep‐by‐step (using the “tax_amount” values only):\n\n1. For example, the first sale record – with id “Sale20240102003” – has a tax_amount of 686.41.\n2. Then “Sale20240103005” has 568.36.\n3. “Sale20240104007” has 623.53.\n4. “Sale20240104008” has 518.64.\n5. “Sale20240104009” has 109.18.\n6. “Sale20240111017” shows 2928.94.\n7. “Sale20240112018” shows 14659.12.\n8. “Sale20240112019” shows 2940.72.\n9. “Sale20240113021” shows 536.78.\n10. “Sale20240113022” shows 2785.8.\n11. “Sale20240113023” shows 704.38.\n12. “Sale20240114024” shows 742.54.\n13. “Sale20240114025” shows 2366.96.\n14. “Sale20240115027” shows 13514.64.\n15. “Sale20240115028” shows 2111.45.\n16. “Sale20240117030” shows 14006.59.\n17. “Sale20240117031” shows 543.34.\n18. “Sale20240117032” shows 640.4.\n19. “Sale20240118033” shows 92.18.\n20. “Sale20240118034” shows 109.89.\n21. “Sale20240119036” shows 9670.08.\n22. “Sale20240119037” shows 13658.45.\n23. “Sale20240122040” shows 2113.25.\n24. “Sale20240124043” shows 2923.47.\n25. “Sale20240124044” shows 14929.01.\n26. “Sale20240124045” shows 108.63.\n27. “Sale20240125048” shows 2181.02.\n28. “Sale20240126050” shows 2936.67.\n29. “Sale20240126051” shows 2663.0.\n30. “Sale20240126052” shows 103.48.\n31. “Sale20240127055” shows 106.37.\n32. “Sale20240127056” shows 136.3.\n33. “Sale20240131059” shows 148.21.\n34. “Sale20240131060” shows 2371.03.\n35. “Sale20240201062” shows 655.35.\n36. “Sale20240201063” shows 90.76.\n37. “Sale20240202065” shows 729.14.\n38. “Sale20240203068” shows 11283.3.\n39. “Sale20240203069” shows 95.86.\n40. “Sale20240205072” shows 482.33.\n41. “Sale20240205073” shows 557.17.\n\nWhen you add all these numbers together the running total is calculated as follows:\n\n• After the first five sales the total is 2506.12.\n• Adding the next five (items 6–10) gives a subtotal of 23034.90.\n• Continuing to add each tax amount step‐by‐step eventually brings the grand total to 129532.73.\n\nThus, the “final tax expense” that should appear on the income statement (based on the tax_amounts in these transactions) is 129532.73.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Tax Expense\": \"129532.73\"} }",
