In this trial, many transactions are listed but only one entry deals with a new fixed asset purchase. In our data the only row with a fixed asset purchase (it has type “Fixed Assets Purchase”) is:\n\n  • id \"FixedAsset20231231001\", with an amount of 85889.19, marked as \"Paid\" and with asset name \"Office Equipment4\".\n\nThe “InitialFixed Assets” row (from the “Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets” entry) is not counted as a purchase transaction—it is the opening balance; the cash flow statement should show the cash outflow for additional fixed asset purchases (in this case, the one fixed asset purchase).\n\nThus, the final purchase of fixed assets reflected in the cash flow statement is 85889.19.\n\nThe answer in the required format is as follows:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"85889.19\"}}",
