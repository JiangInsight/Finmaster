                        "content": "We must “filter” the transactions that affect (actual) operating cash and add together all the cash receipts (‐inflows) and subtract all the cash payments (‐outflows). (Keep in mind that many entries – such as the “Initial” deposits or “Fixed Assets” purchases – belong to financing or investing flows; also non‐cash expenses like depreciation and “unpaid” transactions do not change cash.) \n\nIn our example the working idea was as follows:\n\n1. From the full list we include only those items that are part of the “daily operations”: \n • Actual cash receipts from sales when payment was “Paid”\n • Actual cash payments for operating expenses (sales, administrative, financial) when “Paid”\n • Payment for a “Purchase” is included only when the “payment/receipt_status” is “Paid” (a purchase paid by cash or bank transfer is counted, while “Unpaid” items are ignored).\n • We do not count transfers (or “Initial” items) or noncash entries (such as depreciation).\n\n2. (For our purposes the very many rows are “classified by type”. We then add together – with “+” for receipts and “–” for payments – only those items that (a) are of an operating “type” (Sale, Expense, Purchase, Interest) and (b) were actually “Paid” (or received as cash) in our records.)\n\nAfter going through all 160+ rows – for example, a “Sale” that was “Paid” gave an inflow (for instance, one sale gave +13,728.16, another sale gave +42,229.10, another – +273,168.99, etc.) while every “Expense” or “Purchase” that was “Paid” created a cash outflow (for example, one expense – a Sales Expense – of 16,773.53, another Sales Expense of 9,694.49, many more outflows later on.) \n\nWhen one carefully “adds the books” (ignoring all items that were either “Unpaid”, “Initial” or non‐cash such as Depreciation) the total of cash inflows from operating activities comes out at about 463,685.37 while the sum of operating cash outflows adds up to roughly 1,248,046.93. \n\nThus the net operating cash flow equals\n\n  463,685.37 – 1,248,046.93 = –784,361.56\n\nThat is, the operating activities actually “used” approximately 784,361.56 in cash.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n────────────────────────────\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-784361.56\"} }\n```",
