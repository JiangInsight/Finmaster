                        "content": "We start by extracting the key numbers from the ending balances (we use the ending or average values as needed):\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio \n • Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –1,028,375.55  \n • Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51  \n  Ratio = –1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 ≈ –2.71\n\n2. Debt to Equity Ratio \n • Total Liabilities are taken as the difference between Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity. Here the Balance Sheet shows:  \n  Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity = 14,214,117.02  \n  Total Owner's Equity = 13,835,266.51  \n  Thus, Total Liabilities = 14,214,117.02 – 13,835,266.51 = 378,850.51  \n  Ratio = 378,850.51 / 13,835,266.51 ≈ 0.0274 (or about 0.03)\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n • Total Revenue (from the income statement) = 2,637,011.03  \n • Total Assets at beginning = 13,000,000.00 and ending = 14,214,117.02  \n  Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 14,214,117.02) / 2 = 13,607,058.51  \n  Ratio = 2,637,011.03 / 13,607,058.51 ≈ 0.19\n\n4. Quick Ratio  \n • Quick Assets are defined as current assets excluding inventory.  \n  Ending Current Assets = 9,221,098.50  \n  Inventory = 203,000.00  \n  Quick Assets = 9,221,098.50 – 203,000.00 = 9,018,098.50  \n • Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51  \n  Quick Ratio = 9,018,098.50 / 378,850.51 ≈ 23.79\n\n5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n This is essentially the same as (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities) so the value is –2.71\n\n6. Return on Equity (ROE)  \n • Net Profit = 835,266.51  \n • Owner's Equity at beginning = 13,000,000.00, at ending = 13,835,266.51  \n  Average Owner’s Equity = (13,000,000.00 + 13,835,266.51) / 2 = 13,417,633.255  \n  ROE = 835,266.51 / 13,417,633.255 ≈ 0.0623, or about 6.23%\n\n7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n • Accounts Receivable (beginning = 0, ending = 2,117,339.65)  \n  Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 2,117,339.65) / 2 = 1,058,669.825  \n • Total Revenue = 2,637,011.03  \n  Ratio = 2,637,011.03 / 1,058,669.825 ≈ 2.49\n\nThus, the results can be summarized as follows:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-2.71\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.19\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"23.79\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-2.71\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"6.23%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.49\"\n  }\n}",
