                        "content": "We start by computing each of the requested ratios step‐by‐step using the provided financial statements.\n\n1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)  \nFCF is typically calculated as the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities minus the capital expenditures (in this example, the “Purchase of Fixed Assets”).  \n• Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –1,028,375.55  \n• Purchase of Fixed Assets = 85,889.19  \nThus,  \n  FCF = –1,028,375.55 – 85,889.19 = –1,114,264.74  \n\n2. Return on Assets (ROA)  \nROA is computed as Net Profit divided by the average Total Assets over the period.  \n• Beginning Total Assets = 13,000,000.00  \n• Ending Total Assets = 14,214,117.02  \nAverage Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 14,214,117.02) / 2 = 13,607,058.51  \nNet Profit = 835,266.51  \nThus,  \n  ROA = (835,266.51 / 13,607,058.51) × 100 ≈ 6.14%\n\n3. Return on Equity (ROE)  \nROE is computed as Net Profit divided by the average Owner’s Equity.  \n• Beginning Owner’s Equity = 13,000,000.00  \n• Ending Owner’s Equity = 13,835,266.51  \nAverage Owner’s Equity = (13,000,000.00 + 13,835,266.51) / 2 = 13,417,633.255  \nThus,  \n  ROE = (835,266.51 / 13,417,633.255) × 100 ≈ 6.23%\n\n4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio  \nThis ratio is calculated by dividing the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities by the Net Profit. Note that a negative operating cash flow with a positive net profit will yield a negative ratio.  \n  Ratio = –1,028,375.55 / 835,266.51 ≈ –1.23\n\n5. Net Profit Margin  \nNet Profit Margin is computed as Net Profit divided by Total Revenue (from the income statement).  \n• Net Profit = 835,266.51  \n• Total Revenue = 2,637,011.03  \nThus,  \n  Net Profit Margin = (835,266.51 / 2,637,011.03) × 100 ≈ 31.68%\n\n6. Gross Profit Margin  \nGross Profit Margin is computed as Gross Profit divided by Total Revenue.  \n• Gross Profit = 1,622,011.03  \n• Total Revenue = 2,637,011.03  \nThus,  \n  Gross Profit Margin = (1,622,011.03 / 2,637,011.03) × 100 ≈ 61.53%\n\nNow we can present our answer in the required JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-1114264.74\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"6.14%\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"6.23%\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-1.23\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"31.68%\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"61.53%\"\n  }\n}",
