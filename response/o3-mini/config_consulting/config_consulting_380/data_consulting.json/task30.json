                        "content": "We start by extracting the end‐period data from the three statements:\n\n• From the balance sheet:\n – Total Current Assets = 9,221,098.50 \n – Inventory = 203,000.00 \n – Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51 \n – Total Assets = 14,214,117.02 \n – Total Owner's Equity = 13,835,266.51 \n\n• From the cash flow statement:\n – Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –1,028,375.55 \n\nNow we compute step‑by‑step:\n\n1. Current Ratio = (Current Assets) / (Current Liabilities)  \n  = 9,221,098.50 / 378,850.51 ≈ 24.33\n\n2. Quick Ratio = (Current Assets – Inventory) / (Current Liabilities)  \n  = (9,221,098.50 – 203,000.00) / 378,850.51  \n  = 9,018,098.50 / 378,850.51 ≈ 23.79\n\n3. Debt to Asset Ratio = (Total Liabilities) / (Total Assets)  \n  Here, Total Liabilities are given by the Current Liabilities = 378,850.51  \n  = 378,850.51 / 14,214,117.02 ≈ 0.03\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio = (Total Liabilities) / (Total Owner's Equity)  \n  = 378,850.51 / 13,835,266.51 ≈ 0.03\n\n5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = (Net Operating Cash Flow) / (Total Liabilities)  \n  = (–1,028,375.55) / 378,850.51 ≈ –2.72\n\nThus, the final ratios are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"24.33\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"23.79\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-2.72\"\n  }\n}",
