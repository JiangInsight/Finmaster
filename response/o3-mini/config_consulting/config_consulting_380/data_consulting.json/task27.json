                        "content": "We first need to calculate three ratios from the data provided:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:\n • This ratio is computed as: \n  Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Net Profit)\n • From the cash flow statement, note that:\n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –1,028,375.55 \n  Net Profit = 835,266.51 \n • Thus, the ratio is:\n  = –1,028,375.55 / 835,266.51 ≈ –1.23\n\n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio:\n • Following the sample, we use Total Revenue and the average of the beginning and ending current assets.\n • Total Revenue (from the income statement) = 2,637,011.03 \n • From the balance sheet, Current Assets at the beginning = 8,000,000.00 and at the end = 9,221,098.50.\n • Average Current Assets = (8,000,000.00 + 9,221,098.50) / 2 = 8,610,549.25 \n • Then the ratio is:\n  = 2,637,011.03 / 8,610,549.25 ≈ 0.31\n\n3. Quick Ratio:\n • The Quick Ratio is defined as (Cash and Cash Equivalents + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable) divided by Current Liabilities.\n • From the balance sheet at the end date:\n  Cash on Hand = 2,602,624.45\n  Bank Deposits = 4,283,110.81\n  Interest Receivable = 15,023.59\n  Accounts Receivable = 2,117,339.65\n • Summing these “quick” assets:\n  = 2,602,624.45 + 4,283,110.81 + 15,023.59 + 2,117,339.65 \n  ≈ 9,018,098.50\n • Current Liabilities (sum of Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable) are:\n  Accounts Payable = 247,000.00 \n  Taxes Payable = 131,850.51 \n  Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51\n • Therefore, the Quick Ratio is:\n  = 9,018,098.50 / 378,850.51 ≈ 23.80\n\nThus, the final answers are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-1.23\",\n    \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.31\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"23.80\"\n  }\n}",
