Identify the main components needed for the calculation:\n • From the Cash Flow statement, the key component is the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities.\n • From the Balance Sheet, we use the total debt. In this context, the debt consists of “Accounts Payable” and “Taxes Payable”, which sum to the “Total Current Liabilities”.\n\nStep 2. Extract the values:\n • Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –1,028,375.55 (from cash flow statement)\n • Total Current Liabilities (debt) = Accounts Payable (247,000.00) + Taxes Payable (131,850.51) = 378,850.51\n\nStep 3. Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:\n • Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Current Liabilities)\n • Ratio = –1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 ≈ –2.71\n\nStep 4. Present the answer:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-2.71\"\n  }\n}",
