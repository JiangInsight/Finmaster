                        "content": "We first identify the numbers needed from the three statements.\n\n1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n• From the balance sheet, Accounts Receivable:  \n – Initial: 0.00  \n – End: 2,117,339.65  \n Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 2,117,339.65) / 2 = 1,058,669.825  \n• From the income statement, Main Business Revenue = 2,637,011.03  \n• Therefore, Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 2,637,011.03 / 1,058,669.825 ≈ 2.49  \n\n2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n• From the cash flow statement, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –1,028,375.55  \n• From the balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51  \n• Thus, Operating Cash Flow Ratio = –1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 ≈ –2.71  \n\n3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n• This ratio is computed by the same formula as above so it is also –2.71  \n\n4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n• Total Assets are given on the balance sheet:  \n – Initial: 13,000,000.00  \n – End: 14,214,117.02  \n Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 14,214,117.02) / 2 = 13,607,058.51  \n• Using Main Business Revenue = 2,637,011.03,  \n Total Asset Turnover Ratio = 2,637,011.03 / 13,607,058.51 ≈ 0.19  \n\n5. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n• Liabilities are shown as Current Liabilities = 378,850.51 (there are no other liabilities provided)  \n• Total Owner’s Equity (from the balance sheet) = 13,835,266.51  \n Debt to Equity Ratio = 378,850.51 / 13,835,266.51 ≈ 0.03  \n\nThus, our computed ratios with appropriate rounding are:  \n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.49\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-2.71\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-2.71\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.19\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\"\n  }\n}",
