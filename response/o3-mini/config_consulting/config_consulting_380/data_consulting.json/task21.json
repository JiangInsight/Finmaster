                        "content": "We start by recognizing from the cash flow statement that the Free Cash Flow (FCF) is calculated as: \n\n  FCF = Cash Flow from Operating Activities – Purchase of Fixed Assets\n\nFrom the provided cash flow statement:\n  • Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –1,028,375.55  \n  • Purchase of Fixed Assets = 85,889.19  \n\nThus,  \n  FCF = –1,028,375.55 – 85,889.19 = –1,114,264.74\n\nNext, the Current Assets Turnover Ratio is defined as the revenue divided by the average current assets during the period. The average current assets are computed using the beginning and ending total current assets from the balance sheet.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n  • Beginning Total Current Assets = 8,000,000.00 (as of 2023‑12‑31)  \n  • Ending Total Current Assets = 9,221,098.50 (as of 2024‑02‑05)  \n  Average Current Assets = (8,000,000.00 + 9,221,098.50) / 2  \n    = 17,221,098.50 / 2  \n    ≈ 8,610,549.25\n\nFrom the income statement:\n  • Main Business Revenue = 2,637,011.03\n\nNow, the Current Assets Turnover Ratio is:  \n  Current Assets Turnover Ratio = Main Business Revenue / Average Current Assets  \n    ≈ 2,637,011.03 / 8,610,549.25  \n    ≈ 0.306  \nRounding to two decimal places, we get approximately 0.31.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-1114264.74\",\n    \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.31\"\n  }\n}",
