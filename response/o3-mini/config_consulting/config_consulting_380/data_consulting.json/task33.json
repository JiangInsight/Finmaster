                        "content": "We first identify the key line‐items from the provided statements. Note that “Current Liabilities” is the sum of Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable, and in these examples there are no non‐current liabilities.\n\nStep 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n Definition: Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities  \n From the cash flow statement:  \n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –1,028,375.55  \n From the balance sheet:  \n  Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51  \n Calculation:  \n  –1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 ≈ –2.72  \n\nStep 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \n Definition: Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt  \n (Here “Total Debt” is taken as Total Current Liabilities because no additional liabilities are given.)  \n Calculation:  \n  –1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 ≈ –2.72  \n\nStep 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio  \n Definition: Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  \n Since the beginning inventory was 0, the average inventory = (0 + Ending Inventory) / 2  \n  Ending Inventory = 203,000.00  \n  Average Inventory = 203,000.00 / 2 = 101,500.00  \n From the income statement:  \n  Cost of Goods Sold = 1,015,000.00  \n Calculation:  \n  1,015,000.00 / 101,500.00 = 10.00  \n\nStep 4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n Definition: Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity  \n From the balance sheet:  \n  Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51  \n  Total Owner’s Equity (end) = 13,835,266.51  \n Calculation:  \n  378,850.51 / 13,835,266.51 ≈ 0.03  \n\nStep 5. Quick Ratio  \n Definition: Quick Ratio = (Cash + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities  \n From the balance sheet (end amounts):  \n  Cash on Hand = 2,602,624.45  \n  Bank Deposits = 4,283,110.81  \n  Interest Receivable = 15,023.59  \n  Accounts Receivable = 2,117,339.65  \n Sum of quick assets = 2,602,624.45 + 4,283,110.81 + 15,023.59 + 2,117,339.65 = 9,018,098.50  \n Using Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51  \n Calculation:  \n  9,018,098.50 / 378,850.51 ≈ 23.80  \n\nStep 6. Current Ratio  \n Definition: Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \n From the balance sheet:  \n  Total Current Assets = 9,221,098.50  \n  Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51  \n Calculation:  \n  9,221,098.50 / 378,850.51 ≈ 24.33  \n\nThus, the answer in the required json format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-2.72\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-2.72\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"10.00\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"23.80\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"24.33\"\n  }\n}",
