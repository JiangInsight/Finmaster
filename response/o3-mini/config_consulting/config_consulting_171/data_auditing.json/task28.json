In the row the recorded date is “2024‑01‑15”, the recorded unit price is 44325.13 and the recorded sale total amount is 56945.09. (Other fields – such as profit, payment_mode, etc – are not flagged as inconsistent relative to the textual invoice; we assume they are derived values or not in error.) \n\nBelow is our answer in the requested JSON format.
