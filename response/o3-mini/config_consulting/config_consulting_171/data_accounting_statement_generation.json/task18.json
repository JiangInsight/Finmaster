                        "content": "We can “build” the owner’s‐equity number in two steps. One first identifies the “capital” entered at the start (usually the “Initial” transactions) and then “adjusts” that number by the net “profit” (or “loss”) generated during the period. In our problem the three “Initial20231231001” records add up as follows:\n\n• Cash deposit   = 3,000,000.00 \n• Bank deposit   = 5,000,000.00 \n• Fixed Assets   = 5,000,000.00 \n  —————————————————————\nInitial Owners’ Equity = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.00\n\nNext, we note that while many transactions (for example, purchases, transfers, etc.) change asset or liability accounts and have no immediate effect on the equity, the operating “result” that does affect equity is ﬁrst generated by the “profit‐making” transactions (that is, our sale transactions declare a “profit” – the “profit” column in those rows– that already “net” the (direct) cost of goods) and then reduced by the “expense” side (for example, administrative expenses, sales expenses, financial expenses, and depreciation).\n\nIn our data the “operating result” was “built” by summing – roughly – the following items:\n\n1. Total profit from Sales (each sale row lists a “profit” amount).\n  (sum of all sale‐profits in our table comes to about 2,861,769.51)\n\n2. Some “interest receivable” items were recorded as income.\n  (sum of the many interest receivable entries is about 12,916.58)\n\n3. All “expense” entries – these are the “costs” incurred during the period.\n  (sum of all “Expense…” rows was approximately 621,966.97)\n\n4. Also there are explicit “Depreciation” charges (added as expense):\n  (sum of the two depreciation rows is about 91,505.05)\n\nNow we “net” the income side against the expense side. That is\n\n  Net income ≈ (Sale profits + Interest income) – (Expenses + Depreciation)\n      ≈ (2,861,769.51 + 12,916.58) – (621,966.97 + 91,505.05)\n      ≈ 2,874,686.09 – 713,472.02\n      ≈ 2,161,214.07\n\nThen the “final” owners’ equity is simply the original initial capital plus the net income:\n  Final Owners’ Equity = 13,000,000.00 + 2,161,214.07 = 15,161,214.07\n\nWhen rounding to two decimals the answer is as follows.\n\nThus the answer is presented by the following JSON:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"15161214.07\"}}\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nNote that the “step‐by‐step” approach is to (1) total up the capital initially provided, then (2) add all “incomes” (here the sale‐profit figures plus other income such as interest) and subtract all expenses (operating expenses plus depreciation) to get net income; and finally (3) add net income to the initial capital to obtain the ending owners’ equity.",
