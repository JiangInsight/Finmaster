                        "content": "We must “pick out” only those transactions that – when entered into the system – increase the “liability” side of the balance sheet. In this dataset the only entries that belong on the liabilities side are purchases that were not immediately paid (that is, they were recorded as “Unpaid” or were posted using a “payment method” such as Account Payable). (Other kinds of transactions – Initial entries, Expense, Sale, Depreciation, Interest Receivables – affect assets or expense/profit‐accounts and thus do not go into liabilities.) \n\nStep‐by‐step we go through the “Purchase” entries from the table and check their “payment/receipt_status” (and sometimes the “payment_method”) in order to “flag” those that represent amounts the company still owes:\n\n1. The “Initial” entries (rows with id “Initial20231231001”) are asset entries (cash, bank, fixed assets). They do not contribute to liabilities. Thus, the starting (initial) liabilities on the balance sheet are zero.\n\n2. Now scan the “Purchase” rows:\n\n • Row with id “Purchase20231231001” – its status is “Paid” (paid by Bank Transfer). (Amount = 20,000.0.) → This is not a liability because the payment was already made.\n\n • Row “Purchase20231231002” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231003” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231004” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231005” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231006” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231007” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231008” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231009” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231010” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231011” – Notice here the status is “Unpaid” (and the payment method is “Account Payable”); its amount is 300,000.0. This represents money still owed.\n • Row “Purchase20231231012” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231013” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231014” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231015” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231016” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231017” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231018” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231019” – Its status is “Unpaid” (again the payment method is Account Payable) and the amount is 1,000.0.\n • Row “Purchase20231231020” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231021” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231022” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231023” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231024” – This purchase is “Unpaid” (payment method Account Payable) with the amount 40,000.0.\n • Row “Purchase20231231025” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231026” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231027” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231028” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231029” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231030” – Paid.\n • Row “Purchase20231231031” – This row is “Unpaid” (and again the payment method is Account Payable) and the amount is 40,000.0.\n • (Any further “Purchase” entries are either paid or do not exist in this dataset.)\n\n3. Now add together the amounts for the “Unpaid” purchase transactions:\n • Purchase20231231011: 300,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231019: 1,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231024: 40,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231031: 40,000.0 \n\nThe sum is:  \n 300,000.0 + 1,000.0 = 301,000.0  \n 301,000.0 + 40,000.0 = 341,000.0  \n 341,000.0 + 40,000.0 = 381,000.0\n\n4. Therefore the “Total Liabilities Initial Value” (at the start of the period) is 0.00 and the “Total Liabilities End Value” (after posting all these transactions) is 381,000.00.\n\nThus, the final answer in the requested JSON format is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"381000.00\"} }",
