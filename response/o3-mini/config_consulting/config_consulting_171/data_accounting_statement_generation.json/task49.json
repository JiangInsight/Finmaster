We first summed up the “profit” amounts from each Sale transaction to arrive at a net profit of about 2,861,769.51.\n2. The depreciation adjustments were taken from the two Depreciation entries (≈45,754.64 and 45,750.41) yielding about 91,505.05.\n3. Next, we approximated the “increase in accounts receivable” by summing the “Account Receivable” amounts reported on credit sales – the sum came to about 2,823,515.56 (an increase, so a working subtraction).\n4. Likewise, the “increase in interest receivable” was estimated by summing all Interest Receivable transaction amounts (≈13,278.60), which is subtracted.\n5. No inventory issues were given so inventory change is zero.\n6. For Accounts Payable the unpaid purchase entries (those with “Account Payable” as payment method) totaled about 381,000.00 – added back.\n7. Adding these adjustments to net profit and depreciation produced a net operating cash flow of about 497,480.40.\n8. No specific investing transactions (like a separate fixed asset purchase) were given beyond initial set‐up so investing activity is zero.\n9. The beginning cash balance was the sum of the “Cash deposit” and “Bank deposit” (8,000,000.00) and the net increase (497,480.40) gives an ending balance of 8,497,480.40.\n\nThe values are rounded to two decimals as required.",
