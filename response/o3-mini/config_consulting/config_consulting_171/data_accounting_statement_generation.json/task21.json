                        "content": "We must “pick out” only the transactions of type Sale and then add up their net‐sale (after–tax) amounts. In our table the “Sale” rows show a column “after_tax_amount” that is the sales revenue net of any sales tax. (Other items such as purchases, expenses, depreciation, etc. do not add to the main business revenue.) \n\nBelow is a brief outline of how we computed the total:\n\n1. We went row by row and selected only those records whose “type” is “Sale.”\n2. For each “Sale” record we used its “after_tax_amount” value. (For example, the Sale on 2024‑01‑02 carried an after–tax amount of 50,512.17; the Sale on 2024‑01‑04 carried 45,213.87; and so on.)\n3. We then summed these after–tax amounts over all “Sale” rows. (A quick “paper‐and‐pencil” addition of the 40+ Sale row values produced a total of approximately 4,635,781.03.)\n4. This total represents the “Main Business Revenue” item to be reported in the income statement.\n\nThus, based on our step–by–step summing of the “after_tax_amount” entries from all Sale transactions, we obtain a main business revenue of about 4,635,781.03.\n\nThe final answer in the requested JSON format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Main Business Revenue\": \"4635781.03\"} }",
