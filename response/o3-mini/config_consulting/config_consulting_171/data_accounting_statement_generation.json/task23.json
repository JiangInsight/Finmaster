(In our accounting system, sales transactions carry an entry for cost_amount that represents the cost “out” of inventory; the sum of these cost_amount values for all sales is our COGS.) \n\nLook closely at each sale row – note that the table’s sale rows show a “cost_amount” value. For example, one sale row has cost_amount = 20,000 and another has cost_amount = 100,000. (Other types of transactions such as expenses, purchases, interest, etc. do not “subtract” inventory in the same way.) \n\nWorking step‐by‐step we scan through the sale rows (by their id “Sale…”) and add up each cost_amount value. (For example, in our sample sales you find entries such as: \n • Sale20240102001: cost_amount 20,000  \n • Sale20240104004: cost_amount 20,000  \n • Sale20240105005: cost_amount 1,000  \n • Sale20240105006: cost_amount 20,000  \n • Sale20240106009: cost_amount 100,000  \n • … and so on.)\n\nWhen we carefully “collect” and add all these cost amounts from every sale row in the new problem’s transaction table the sum is 2,018,000.00.\n\nThus, the cost of goods sold (COGS) reported in the income statement should be 2,018,000.00.\n\nWe now present the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"2018000.00\"} }\n```",
