                        "content": "We can show that the final balance‐sheet “assets” value is not the sum of every debit “expense” (or “sale” etc.) appearing on the income side but the net result of operating and financing transactions on the “asset” accounts (for example “Cash”, “Bank”, “Fixed Assets” and “Receivables”). In our books the three initial “Initial” entries (the Cash deposit, Bank deposit and Fixed Assets) add up to\n\n  3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 13,000,000.00\n\nThat is the beginning “Total Assets Initial Value.”\n\nThen throughout January–February the business carries on many transactions – receiving interest receivables (which are recorded as assets), collecting sales (cash or account receivables) and spending money on expenses, purchasing new items and even depreciating fixed assets. (For example, notice that a “Depreciation” entry of about 45,754.64 on 2024‑01‑01 and a similar one on 2024‑02‑01 reduce the book value of Fixed Assets, while many “Interest Receivables” add up nearly 13,280 to the balance.) When all of these money‐and “account receivable” changes are “netted” in the balance‐sheet accounts the ending “assets” total has moved upward (because the earned revenue – even after subtracting expense outlays and noncash depreciation– has helped support an increase in the “asset” side).\n\nIn our trial balance the net effect comes to a “Total Assets End Value” of\n\n  13,216,409.49\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Assets Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Total Assets End Value\": \"13216409.49\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote: In a real accounting system each transaction is posted to the appropriate asset (or liability/equity) account so that although many entries (sales, expenses, purchases, transfers, etc.) appear, the “net” effect on the aggregate asset total is computed correctly – here the ending asset sum is 13,216,409.49.",
