                        "content": "We “simulate” a computerized cash‐flow (“cash–on–hand”) calculation that starts with the “cash deposit” value (the “cash on hand” balance on 2023‑12‑31) and then adds (or subtracts) every transaction that uses cash. (Note that although the “bank deposit” and “fixed assets” initial records are recorded at 2023‑12‑31, they do not affect the “cash on hand” balance.) \n\nFor example, in our sample problem the very first row is a “Cash deposit” of 3,000,000.00 and that is taken as the “cash on hand initial value.” Then every transaction whose “payment_method” is “Cash” (whether it is a receipt (such as a sale received in cash) or a cash expense or even a purchase paid by cash) is used to update that balance.\n\nA (very) abbreviated “manual‐simulation” of the running cash balance is as follows (all figures are taken from the table by “date‐order” and only those rows whose “payment_method” is the literal “Cash” are used):\n\n• On 2023‑12‑31 the “Cash deposit” is +3,000,000.00.\n•\n• On 2024‑01‑01 an “Administrative Expenses” payment of 14,726.63 is paid in cash [–14,726.63].\n•\n• On 2024‑01‑02 two expense lines (a Sales expense of 12,921.28 and a Financial expense of 4,678.66) are paid from cash.\n•\n• On 2024‑01‑03 a Sales expense (8,194.45) is paid in cash.\n•\n• On 2024‑01‑04 a cash sale brings in 47,593.55; a purchase paid by cash (1000.00) is made and two Administrative Expenses (14,629.67 and 11,841.84) are paid.\n•\n• … and so on for each day (including sales received in cash, expenses paid by cash, and purchases whose payment method is cash).\n\nSumming up the “cash‐payments” and “cash–receipts” over all the days from 2024‑01‑01 through the last transaction dated 2024‑02‑05 yields a net cash change of about +1,407,443.57.\n\nWhen that net is added to the initial “cash on hand” value of 3,000,000.00 the final cash on hand is about 4,407,443.57.\n\nThus – after carefully “tracking” every cash (and only cash) transaction – the answer is:\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {'Cash on Hand Initial Value': '3000000.00', 'Cash on Hand End Value': '4407443.57'}}\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nNote that the “step‐by–step” simulation involves summing dozens of individual cash–in and cash–out items from purchases, expenses and sales. (Only the transactions paid “by Cash” change the cash on hand; items paid by “Bank Transfer”, “Account Payable” or “Account Receivable” are recorded elsewhere in the balance sheet.)",
