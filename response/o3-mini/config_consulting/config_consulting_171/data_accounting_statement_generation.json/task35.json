The “Sale”‐type transactions (52 rows in total) were summed to yield the “Main Business Revenue” (which – here – is the same as “Total Revenue”). Their “amount” fields add up approximately to 4,878,769.51.\n\n2. The “cost_amount” on the sale transactions were summed (using each sale’s cost indicator such as 20,000.00, 1,000.00, 100,000.00, etc.) to yield a total “Cost of Goods Sold” of about 2,018,000.00. This value is taken as the “Total Cost.”\n\n3. The difference between revenue and cost gives the “Gross Profit” (≈4,878,769.51 – 2,018,000.00 = 2,860,769.51).\n\n4. Expense transactions were then segregated into operating cost sub‑categories. Administrative expenses (from various “Expense… Administrative Expenses” rows) were totaled to roughly 338,330.59 and sales (here “selling”) expenses (from the “Expense… Sales Expenses” rows) summed to about 229,360.47. Depreciation entries (from the depreciation transactions) add up to about 91,505.05 while Financial Expenses sum to about 77,005.45. Their total is taken as “Total Expenses” (≈736,201.56).\n\n5. Various “Interest Receivables” rows were summed to give an “Interest Income” of approximately 13,005.57.\n\n6. Then the “Profit Before Tax” is computed by taking the gross profit, subtracting total operating expenses and adding interest income (2,860,769.51 – 736,201.56 + 13,005.57 ≈ 2,137,573.52).\n\n7. An approximate tax charge – derived by summing the tax amounts provided on the sales (roughly 242,888.83) – is then subtracted from profit before tax to yield a “Net Profit” of about 1,894,684.69.\n\nThese rounded‐figure numbers constitute the complete income statement for the period.\n",
