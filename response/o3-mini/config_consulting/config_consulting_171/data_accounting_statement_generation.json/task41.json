                        "content": "We need to “build” the accounts‐payable balance from the “Purchase” transactions whose payment status is “Unpaid” (or whose payment method is “Account Payable”). In our “problem to solve” table the beginning balances for accounts payable are zero (there is no opening accounts payable entry) so the “increase (decrease) in AP” is simply the sum of – in “Purchase” transactions – those that are not paid.\n\nLet’s review the purchase rows (showing only those with “Unpaid” or a payment method of “Account Payable”):\n\n1. • ID = Purchase20231231011  \n  • Amount = 300,000.00  \n  • Status = Unpaid and payment method “Account Payable”\n\n2. • ID = Purchase20231231019  \n  • Amount = 1,000.00  \n  • Status = Unpaid (payment method “Account Payable”)\n\n3. • ID = Purchase20231231024  \n  • Amount = 40,000.00  \n  • Status = Unpaid (payment method “Account Payable”)\n\n4. • ID = Purchase20231231031  \n  • Amount = 40,000.00  \n  • Status = Unpaid (payment method “Account Payable”)\n\nAll the other purchase entries (for IDs 01, 02, 03, …, 10, 12, etc.) were marked as “Paid” so they do not add to outstanding accounts payable.\n\nNow, summing the amounts for the unpaid purchases:\n 300,000.00 + 1,000.00 = 301,000.00  \n 301,000.00 + 40,000.00 = 341,000.00  \n 341,000.00 + 40,000.00 = 381,000.00\n\nThus the net increase in accounts payable is 381,000.00.\n\nWe now provide the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"381000.00\"}}\n```",
