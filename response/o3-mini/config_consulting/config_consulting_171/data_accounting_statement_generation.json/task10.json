(The “Cash deposit” and “Bank deposit” transactions are current asset items.) \n\nThen, when we look at the other transactions we find only one kind of adjustment to the fixed asset balance – depreciation. In our data there are two depreciation entries:\n • Depreciation20240101001 with an amount of 45,754.64\n • Depreciation20240201002 with an amount of 45,750.41\n\nThese two together reduce the non‐current assets:\n Total depreciation = 45,754.64 + 45,750.41 = 91,505.05\n\nThere are no “Fixed Asset purchase” (that is, capital expenditure) transactions in this data that would add to the nonâ€‘current assets. (All the “Purchase” transactions here relate to items such as consulting services or ordinary supplies which are either expensed or treated as current inventory.)\n\nThus, the ending non‐current assets “net book value” is calculated as:\n Ending Value = Initial value + [any additions] – Total depreciation\n        = 5,000,000.00 – 91,505.05 \n        ≈ 4,908,494.95\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"4908494.95\"} }",
