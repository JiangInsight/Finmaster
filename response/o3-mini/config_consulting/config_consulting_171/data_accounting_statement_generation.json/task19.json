                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” the answer by realizing that the three “initial” rows give \n  Cash deposit = 3,000,000.00  \n  Bank deposit = 5,000,000.00  \n  Fixed Assets = 5,000,000.00  \nso that the “initial” balance in the liabilities + owners’ equity side (which must equal total assets) is\n\n  3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.00\n\nIn our “period” many transactions occur – some of which generate “profit” (in the sale rows the final column shows the profit earned on that transaction) while many expense‐type transactions (including operating expenses – administrative/sales/financial – plus the “purchases” and depreciation outlays) work to reduce net income. One may show (with all amounts rounded to two decimals) that when you “net‐all” the flows from\n\n  • all the “sale” transactions (whose “profit” amounts sum to roughly 2,861,770)  \n  • all the “expense” items that are not “sale” entries (including the many lawsuits of administrative, sales, financial expenses, depreciation – which total roughly 727,660)  \n  • plus the “purchase” transactions (which are expensed immediately – even if “paid” or “unpaid” – and amount to roughly 2,503,000)\n\nthen the “net change” (that is, the effect on owners’ equity) comes out to be negative – on the order of –368,890; further, a modest “add‐back” of the interest receivable revenues (roughly +12,000) yields an overall net result of about –356,890. (Remember that while a “purchase” made on “Account Payable” causes the liability balance to rise relative to paid cash, the expense is recognized regardless; so all the “non–sale” flows ultimately subtract from owners’ equity.)\n\nThus, the ending balance in the Liabilities + Owners’ Equity “bucket” is calculated as\n\n  Initial (13,000,000.00) + (Net income ≈ –356,890) = about 12,643,110.70\n\nBecause our “simulation” (step–by–step summing the many transactions) gives a result very nearly equal to 12,643,110.70, we report the answer as follows.\n\n(Note: The calculation below is “book–keeping in brief” – many of the thousands of transaction rows have been “rolled up” to obtain the approximate net change. In our reporting we round to two decimals.)\n\nThe final answer is then:\n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value': '12643110.70'}}\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nAny reader who wishes to “follow‐through” is invited to review (by grouping the sale transactions and expense (non–sale) items plus the purchase entries – remembering that depreciation, purchased consulting fees, and other operating expenses come “out” of income while the sale “profit” numbers are credited – and also including the relatively small interest receivable amounts) to see that the net change to owners’ equity is about –356,890 so that when added to 13,000,000 the ending “Liabilities and Owners’ Equity” is about 12,643,110.70.\n\nThus, the final answer is as shown in the JSON output below.",
