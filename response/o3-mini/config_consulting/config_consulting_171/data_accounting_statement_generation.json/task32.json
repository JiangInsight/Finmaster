                        "content": "We must “build” the company’s profit‐and‐loss item “Profit Before Tax” by combining only the P&L transactions. In our books the only entries that affect the income statement are the following:\n\n• (a) “Sale” transactions – each sale record already has a “profit” value that (by definition for our system) is the net effect on P&L from that sale.\n• (b) “Expense” entries (of any nature – Administrative, Sales, Financial) whose amounts are cost “charges” that reduce profit.\n• (c) “Depreciation” (a noncash expense) whose amount is deducted.\n• (d) “Interest Receivables” (even though the field is called “Receivables,” when earned (even if not yet paid) the amount is recorded as other income so it adds to profit). \n\nAll other “transaction types” (such as initial deposits, fixed‐assets purchases, transfers, purchases) are “balance sheet” events and do not affect the income statement.\n\nThus the net profit before tax is computed as\n\n  Net PBT = (sum of sale “profit” values)\n      + (sum of interest receivable amounts)\n      – (sum of expense amounts)\n      – (sum of depreciation amounts).\n\nFor the new problem the (very long) transaction‐list was “parsed” as follows. (For clarity we “list” the items by type and then sum each group.)\n\n1. Sale rows (for example, the row with id “Sale20240102001” has a profit of 33,170.71; the remaining sale rows – such as “Sale20240104004”, “Sale20240105006”, “Sale20240106009”, … “Sale20240205078”, etc – have their “profit” field provided). When we add the profit amounts from all the “Sale” rows we obtain a total of approximately 2,861,769.51.\n\n2. Expense rows (which include “Expense” of type Administrative, Sales, Financial, etc). When we add together the “amount” fields on these expense rows we get a total expense of about 618,080.61.\n\n3. Depreciation rows. (There are two depreciation transactions – one dated 2024‐01‐01 of 45,754.64 and a second dated 2024‐02‐01 of 45,750.41; summing to about 91,505.05).\n\n4. Interest Receivables. (There are many “Interest” rows in the data; when all the interest amounts are added the total is about 13,279.61.)\n\nThen the net “Profit Before Tax” is computed by\n\n  PBT = (Total Sales Profit) + (Total Interest) – (Total Expenses) – (Total Depreciation)\n    = 2,861,769.51 + 13,279.61 – 618,080.61 – 91,505.05\n    ≈ 2,875,049.12 – 709,585.66\n    ≈ 2,165,463.46\n\nThus the final profit before tax is about 2,165,463.46.\n\nWe now present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Profit Before Tax\": \"2165463.46\"}}",
