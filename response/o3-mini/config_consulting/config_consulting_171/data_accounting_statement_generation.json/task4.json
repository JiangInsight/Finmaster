                        "content": "We must “build up” the balance‐sheet “Accounts Receivable” figure from the operating transactions. In our table no beginning “AR” appears (the three “Initial” transactions are for cash, bank and fixed assets only) so the beginning AR is zero. Then we “add” every sale (and “interest receivable” item) that is made on “account” rather than with immediate cash. (Transactions whose “receive_method” is “Account Receivable” or – in the case of interest – “Interest receviable” increase AR; other transactions (for example, sales paid by cash) do not affect AR.) \n\nA careful review of the table – going row‐by‐row – shows that the following items add to AR:\n\n• Interest transactions (of type “Interest Receivables”) with amounts such as 443.22, 443.22, 441.44, 439.66, 416.52, 416.52, 383.23, 383.23, 388.84, 388.84, 383.23, 383.23, 371.93 (and many more in later rows) all have their “receive_method” marked “Interest receviable” – these are “owed” \n• Sales whose “receive_method” is “Account Receivable” (for example, the Sale on 2024‑01‑02 for 53,170.71; then later sales for 24X thousand, 190,478.23; 243,590.56; 192,028.00; 52,961.46; etc.) are added.\n\nOne may sum up (step‐by‐step, grouping the “AR–adding” transactions) the following list of contributions:\n\n  443.22  \n+ 53,170.71  \n+ 443.22  \n+ 441.44  \n+ 439.66  \n+ 2,943.51  \n+ 416.52  \n+ 262,445.58  \n+ 416.52  \n+ 192,028.00  \n+ 52,961.46  \n+ 389.73  \n+ 2,925.01  \n+ 388.84  \n+ 10,545.58  \n+ 388.84  \n+ 383.23  \n+ 383.23  \n+ 242,599.54  \n+ 243,590.56  \n+ 383.06  \n+ 380.83  \n+ 190,478.23  \n+ 48,342.01  \n+ 371.93  \n+ 371.93  \n+ 2,667.21  \n+ 10,762.61  \n+ 2,942.21  \n+ 363.03  \n+ 250,090.56  \n+ 363.03  \n+ 363.03  \n+ 58,141.88  \n+ 1,915.39  \n+ 363.03  \n+ 53,934.40  \n+ 181,654.50  \n+ 12,736.60  \n+ 361.25  \n+ 11,667.43  \n+ 52,739.99  \n+ 361.25  \n+ 196,484.20  \n+ 361.25  \n+ 359.92  \n+ 11,498.77  \n+ 53,628.00  \n+ 218,410.49  \n+ 359.92  \n+ 359.92  \n+ 2,220.88  \n+ 46,461.67  \n+ 359.92  \n+ 351.02  \n+ 351.02  \n+ 13,371.18  \n+ 58,898.91  \n+ 351.02  \n+ 53,162.19  \n+ 324.32  \n+ 14,642.94  \n+ 318.53  \n+ 44,442.71  \n+ 318.53  \n+ 300.73  \n+ 300.73  \n+ 292,202.87  \n+ 37,363.94  \n+ 274.03\n\nWhen one adds these 70 “AR‐adding” amounts the total AR “balance” comes to roughly 2,996,988.30. (Note that when doing this “by hand” one must be careful with rounding; here we show two–decimal–point accuracy.) \n\nThus, with no beginning AR we have:\n\n Accounts Receivable – Initial Value = 0.00  \n Accounts Receivable – End Value = 2,996,988.30\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON response format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"2996988.30\"\n  }\n}\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is our final answer.",
