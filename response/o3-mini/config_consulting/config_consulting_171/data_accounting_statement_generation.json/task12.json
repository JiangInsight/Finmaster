                        "content": "We need to identify which transactions “create” a liability (accounts payable) versus those that are already “settled” (paid) or are not affecting the liability‐accounts. In our list only “Purchase” transactions that (a) were not paid – typically with a “Unpaid” status – and (b) show a payment method of “Account Payable” are used to “build up” the ending accounts payable balance. Also note that the “Initial” transactions (the opening balances on 2023‑12‑31) do not include any accounts payable. (They only record cash, bank, fixed assets etc.) \n\nStep–by–step we go through the list of transactions:\n\n1. The “Initial…” rows (rows 1–3) are opening balances for cash, bank and fixed assets. None of these are liabilities, so the opening (initial) accounts payable is zero.\n\n2. Then we review each “Purchase” row. Most of these purchases are paid (via Bank Transfer, Cash, etc.) so they “settle” immediately and do not add to accounts payable. We only need those “Purchase” entries where the Payment/Receipt Status is “Unpaid” and – importantly – the Payment Method is “Account Payable.”\n\nLooking through our transactions we find four such entries:\n\n• Row 51: \n  id = Purchase20231231011, type = Purchase, amount = 300000.0, Payment method = Account Payable, and its status is “Unpaid.”\n\n• Row 97:\n  id = Purchase20231231019, type = Purchase, amount = 1000.0, Payment method = Account Payable, status = “Unpaid.”\n\n• Row 135:\n  id = Purchase20231231024, type = Purchase, amount = 40000.0, Payment method = Account Payable, status = “Unpaid.”\n\n• Row 177:\n  id = Purchase20231231031, type = Purchase, amount = 40000.0, Payment method = Account Payable, status = “Unpaid.”\n\n3. The total outstanding (end–of–period) accounts payable is the sum of these amounts:\n\n  300000.0 + 1000.0 + 40000.0 + 40000.0 = 381000.0\n\nThus in our final balance sheet the accounts payable item has:\n\n– An initial value (at dec31 before any purchases) of 0.00  \n– A final (end–of–period) value of 381000.00\n\nBelow is the answer in the required json format.\n\n────────────────────────────\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"381000.00\"} }\n```",
