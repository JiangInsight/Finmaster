                        "content": "We can think of retained earnings as “what is left over” after all the operating gains and losses are “closed‐to­” equity. In our simplified “period‐end” calculation we assume that (a) if nothing else is given the opening retained earnings is zero and (b) each “sale” transaction already “reports” its net “profit” (that is, the amount earned above its cost) while all “expense” items (which include regular administrative, sales, financial costs and “noncash” depreciation) get deducted from income. (Purchases – used to acquire stock or fixed assets – do not in themselves immediately affect profit.)Thus the retained earnings at the period end is computed as\n\n  Retained Earnings_End = Retained Earnings_Opening + (Sum of the sale profits – Sum of the expense–type outflows)\n\nIn our case the data include three “initial” records (for cash, bank and fixed‐assets) but nothing in those initial records indicates any opening Retained Earnings. (Many companies “start” with a zero retained earnings so that all net profit “flows” into retained earnings in the current period.)We therefore take:\n\n  Retained Earnings_Opening = 0.00\n\nThen we must “close the books” for the period. To do this we add up (a) every sale row’s “profit” value and then subtract the “amount” of every expense (those that are recorded as administrative expenses, sales expenses, financial expenses, and also depreciation) because these costs “reduce” net income.\n\nFor example (note that a full manual sum is not very short but here is one way to see it):\n\n• The sale transactions (by their “profit” column) add up approximately to 2,861,769.51.\n• The “expense‐side” items (that is, expenses and depreciation) add up roughly to 715,507.38.\n \nThus the net effect – the net income earned during the period – is about\n\n  Net income ≈ 2,861,769.51 – 715,507.38 = 2,146,262.13.\n \nThen, since Retained Earnings_End = Opening (0.00) + net income, we have\n\n  Retained Earnings_End ≈ 2,146,262.13.\n \nWhen we round to two decimal places we finally obtain:\n\n  Retained Earnings Initial Value = 0.00  \n  Retained Earnings End Value = 2146262.13\n\n(Notice that the “exact” number depends on how one adds each transaction; here we have computed approximate totals from the data provided.)\n\nWe now present the answer in the required json format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Retained Earnings Initial Value': '0.00', 'Retained Earnings End Value': '2146262.13'} }",
