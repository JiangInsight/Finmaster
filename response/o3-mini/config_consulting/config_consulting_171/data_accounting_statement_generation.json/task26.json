In the provided transactions (for the problem to solve) there are two rows with the “Depreciation” type, one with a recorded date of 2024‑01‑01 and one with a recorded date of 2024‑02‑01. We then decide which one is “final” by looking at the dates. Since 2024‑02‑01 is later than 2024‑01‑01, the depreciation entry on 2024‑02‑01 is the final one. Its recorded_amount is 45750.41. \n\nThus, the final depreciation item in the income statement is 45750.41.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Depreciation\": \"45750.41\"}}",
