(Many of the other transactions are either operating purchases, sales, expenses, depreciation or other items that do not change the gross (undepreciated) fixed‐asset cost shown on the balance sheet.) \n\nIn other words, because no additional fixed asset purchase (such as a “Fixed Assets Purchase” type) has been recorded, the fixed assets “at cost” remain at their initial value. \n\nThus:\n • Fixed Assets Initial Value = 5,000,000.00 \n • Fixed Assets End Value = 5,000,000.00\n\nWe now present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"5000000.00\"\n  }\n}",
