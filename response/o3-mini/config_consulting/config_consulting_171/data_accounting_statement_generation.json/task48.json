                        "content": "We must “derive” the net change in cash by “adding up” only those transactions that affect your actual cash and cash‐equivalent account (money received as cash and money going out in cash payments) while ignoring non‐cash items (for example depreciation) and sales on account (or purchases that have not been paid) as well as inter–account transfers.\n\nBelow is one way to “reason through” the process:\n\n1. The “Initial” records (for example the “Cash deposit” of 3,000,000 and “Bank deposit” of 5,000,000) set your opening balances. (The “Fixed Assets” record does not represent cash even though it appears in the journal.) For purposes of “net increase” in cash you do not add the beginning balances – you only add items that change cash during the period.\n\n2. Next you review every row and decide whether it represents an actual cash payment or receipt. For instance:\n • A “Purchase” that is “Paid” by Cash or by Bank Transfer (and not later marked “Unpaid”) is a cash outflow.\n • An “Expense” that is “Paid” by Cash is a cash outflow.\n • A “Sale” that is “Paid” with Cash is a cash inflow.\n • “Sales” entered as “Account Receivable” (or “Unpaid”) are not included in a cash flow because no cash changes hands.\n • Items such as “Depreciation” (a non‐cash expense) and “Interest Receivables” with status “Unpaid” are excluded.\n • Finally, transfers between your “Cash” and “Bank” accounts cancel out (and are ignored).\n\n3. By scanning the table we (approximately) include only those transactions where the payment/receipt method is “Cash” (or, if using bank transfer as a real payment) and the transaction “status” is Paid.\n\nAfter going through the table step‐by‐step and summing the “inflows” (all the sales that were actually paid in cash) and the “outflows” (all purchases and expenses actually paid by cash or bank transfer) we come up with, very roughly, a total cash inflow of about 1,850,787 and a total cash outflow of about 2,633,118.\n\nSubtracting these gives:\n Net Increase in Cash = 1,850,786.99 – 2,633,117.74 ≈ –782,330.75\n\nThat is, over the period the cash and cash equivalents dropped by roughly 782,330.75.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"-782330.75\"} }\n```",
