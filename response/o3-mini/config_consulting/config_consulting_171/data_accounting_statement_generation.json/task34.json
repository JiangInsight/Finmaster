                        "content": "We must “build‐up” the income statement by including only the transactions that affect the profit–and then “netting” revenues against costs. In our data only a few types hit the income statement (sales, interest income, expenses and depreciation). (Transactions such as “Initial”, “Fixed Assets” and “Purchase” are balance‐sheet events and do not affect the income statement.)\n\nIn our solution we proceed as follows:\n\n1. For every row whose “type” is “Sale” the “profit” column already gives the profit on that sale. (That is, it was computed as after_tax_amount minus cost_amount.) In our data there are 52 “Sale” rows; when we add all the “profit” values together the sum comes to about \n  2,861,770.51.\n\n2. Next, we include the “Interest Receivables” – these are revenue items. (Even though many are “Unpaid” the income statement records the receivable’s revenue.) When we add all the interest‐amounts (from all the “Interest Receivables” rows) we get about \n  12,190.52.\n\n3. Then we subtract the “Expense” items. These are the rows whose “type” starts with “Expense” (whether Administrative, Sales or Financial). When we added together all the amounts on those rows the total came to about \n  621,966.97.\n\n4. In addition we subtract “Depreciation” – here there are two rows (one on 2024‑01‑01 and one on 2024‑02‑01) whose amounts add to about \n  91,505.05.\n\nThus the net profit is computed as\n\n  Net Profit = (Sum of sale profit) + (Interest income)\n         – (Sum of Expense amounts) – (Depreciation)\n\nThat is approximately\n\n  Net Profit = 2,861,770.51 + 12,190.52 – 621,966.97 – 91,505.05\n         ≈ 2,873,961.03 – 713,472.02 \n         ≈ 2,160,489.01\n\nSo the final net profit (rounded to two decimals) is about 2,160,489.01.\n\nWe now present the answer as requested:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"2160489.01\"}}\n``` \n\n(Notes: In a real‐world situation the calculations are done with exact figures; here each group was summed step‐by‐step so that the final rounded answer is approximately 2,160,489.01.)",
