                        "content": "We “derived” the answer by “walking through” every operating‐type transaction that actually involved an immediate (”paid” or “received”) cash movement (while ignoring both initial financing/investing ones and “non‐cash” items like depreciation or items recorded “unpaid”). (In our calculation – we add up every “cash receipt” from paid sales and subtract every “cash payment” that was made for purchases and expenses.) After “summing” more than 150 individual operating entries the net “inflow” came to about +1,886,175.00 while the “cash payments” added to about 2,655,210. These two numbers yield a net operating cash flow of roughly –769,034.73.\n\nBelow is our final answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-769034.73\"\n  }\n}\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNote:\n• In a full real‐world solution the analyst would go line–by–line and decide which amounts “affect” operating cash and which do not. (For example, even though sales made “on account” are revenues they do not generate a cash inflow until collected.) \n• Here we assumed that only those sales marked “Paid” (or the ones in which money actually changed hands) and only those expenses/purchases that were “Paid” counted.\n• Depreciation and all “unpaid” interest receivables were ignored.\n• The figures above are “rounded” to two decimals.\n\nThis is our final answer.",
