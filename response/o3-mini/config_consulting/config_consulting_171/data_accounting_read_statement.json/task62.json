For amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit we look for the \"Accounts Receivable\" line in the Balance Sheet. Its end value is 2984071.72.\n\n2. For financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds we look for \"Financial Expenses\" in the Income Statement. Its value is 67135.35.\n\n3. For cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment we examine the Cash Flow Statement under investing activities. The line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" has a value of 0.00.\n\nThus, grouping them as required by the order:\n- Balance Sheet (“Accounts Receivable”): 2984071.72\n- Income Statement (“Financial Expenses”): 67135.35\n- Cash Flow Statement (“Purchase of Fixed Assets”): 0.00\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value1\": \"2984071.72\",\n    \"value2\": \"67135.35\",\n    \"value3\": \"0.00\"\n  }\n}",
