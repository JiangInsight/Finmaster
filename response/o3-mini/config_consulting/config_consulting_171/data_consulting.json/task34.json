                        "content": "We start by computing each ratio step‐by‐step.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n  = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Current Liabilities)  \n  = (–862,455.97) / (624,988.48)  \n  ≈ –1.38\n\n2. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n  Total Liabilities can be found as:  \n    Total Liabilities = Total Assets – Total Owner’s Equity  \n      = 15,528,390.30 – 14,903,401.82  \n      = 624,988.48  \n  = (Total Liabilities) / (Owner’s Equity)  \n  = 624,988.48 / 14,903,401.82  \n  ≈ 0.04\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n  We use the average total assets over the period.  \n  Average Total Assets = (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2  \n    = (13,000,000.00 + 15,528,390.30) / 2  \n    = 28,528,390.30 / 2  \n    ≈ 14,264,195.15  \n  Then,  \n  Total Asset Turnover Ratio = (Total Revenue) / (Average Total Assets)  \n  = 4,879,769.51 / 14,264,195.15  \n  ≈ 0.34\n\n4. Quick Ratio  \n  Quick Assets are current assets that can be quickly converted to cash. They include Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, and Accounts Receivable (but exclude Inventory).  \n  Quick Assets = 4,058,544.03 + 3,079,000.00 + 13,279.60 + 2,984,071.72  \n    = 10,134,895.35  \n  Then,  \n  Quick Ratio = (Quick Assets) / (Total Current Liabilities)  \n  = 10,134,895.35 / 624,988.48  \n  ≈ 16.22\n\n5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n  This is similarly defined as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio, so it is:  \n  ≈ –1.38\n\n6. Return on Equity (ROE)  \n  ROE is calculated using the average Owner’s Equity over the period.  \n  Average Owner's Equity = (Beginning Owner’s Equity + Ending Owner’s Equity) / 2  \n    = (13,000,000.00 + 14,903,401.82) / 2  \n    = 27,903,401.82 / 2  \n    ≈ 13,951,700.91  \n  Then,  \n  ROE = (Net Profit) / (Average Owner’s Equity) × 100  \n  = (1,903,401.82) / (13,951,700.91) × 100  \n  ≈ 13.64%\n\n7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n  Use the average accounts receivable (the beginning value is 0 and ending is 2,984,071.72):  \n  Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 2,984,071.72) / 2  \n    = 1,492,035.86  \n  Then,  \n  Accounts Receivable Turnover = (Total Revenue) / (Average Accounts Receivable)  \n  = 4,879,769.51 / 1,492,035.86  \n  ≈ 3.27\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.38\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.04\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.34\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"16.22\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.38\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"13.64%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.27\"\n  }\n}",
