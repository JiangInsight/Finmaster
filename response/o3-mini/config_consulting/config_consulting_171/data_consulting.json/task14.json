In many cases, Total Revenue is used as a proxy for credit sales when details are not given.\n\nStep 4: Compute the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio.\nFormula: Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue ÷ Average Accounts Receivable\n= 4,879,769.51 / 1,492,035.86 ≈ 3.27\n\nThus, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is approximately 3.27.\n\nFinal JSON answer:\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.27\"\n  }\n}",
