                        "content": "We need to find five ratios based on the balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement. Here’s how to calculate each ratio step by step:\n\n1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n   The formula used is:  \n  (Total Revenue + Interest Income) / Average Accounts Receivable  \n  Note: Since the beginning Accounts Receivable is zero, the average is simply half of the ending balance.  \n  • Main Business Revenue = 4,879,769.51  \n  • Interest Income = 13,279.60  \n  • Sum = 4,879,769.51 + 13,279.60 = 4,893,049.11  \n  • Ending Accounts Receivable = 2,984,071.72  \n  • Average Accounts Receivable = 2,984,071.72 / 2 = 1,492,035.86  \n  • Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 4,893,049.11 / 1,492,035.86 ≈ 3.28  \n\n2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n   The formula is:  \n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities  \n  • Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –862,455.97  \n  • Total Current Liabilities = 624,988.48  \n  • Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -862,455.97 / 624,988.48 ≈ -1.38  \n\n3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n   In our case, this is the same measure as above, so the ratio is also ≈ –1.38  \n\n4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n   The formula is:  \n  Total Revenue / Average Total Assets  \n  • Total Revenue = 4,879,769.51  \n  • Beginning Total Assets = 13,000,000.00  \n  • Ending Total Assets = 15,528,390.30  \n  • Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 15,528,390.30) / 2 = 14,264,195.15  \n  • Total Asset Turnover Ratio = 4,879,769.51 / 14,264,195.15 ≈ 0.34  \n\n5. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n   Using the common approach when no long-term liabilities are explicitly provided, debt is considered as current liabilities.  \n  • Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 624,988.48  \n  • Total Owner’s Equity (end) = 14,903,401.82  \n  • Debt to Equity Ratio = 624,988.48 / 14,903,401.82 ≈ 0.04  \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.28\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-1.38\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.38\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.34\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.04\"\n  }\n}",
