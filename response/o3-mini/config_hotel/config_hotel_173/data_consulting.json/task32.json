                        "content": "We start by extracting the key figures:\n\n1. Free Cash Flow (FCF) is computed as:\n  FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –4,510,837.08  \n  Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = –251,793.02  \nSo,\n  FCF = –4,510,837.08 + (–251,793.02) = –4,762,630.10\n\n2. Return on Assets (ROA) is calculated using:\n  ROA = (Net Profit / Average Total Assets) × 100%\n\nThe balance sheet shows:\n  Beginning Total Assets = 16,000,000.00  \n  Ending Total Assets = 19,520,226.07  \nAverage Total Assets = (16,000,000.00 + 19,520,226.07) / 2 = 17,760,113.035  \nNet Profit (from the income statement) = 143,922.03  \nThus,\n  ROA = (143,922.03 / 17,760,113.035) × 100% ≈ 0.81%\n\n3. Return on Equity (ROE) is given by:\n  ROE = (Net Profit / Average Owner's Equity) × 100%\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n  Beginning Owner’s Equity = 16,000,000.00  \n  Ending Owner’s Equity = 16,143,922.03  \nAverage Owner’s Equity = (16,000,000.00 + 16,143,922.03) / 2 = 16,071,961.015  \nSo,\n  ROE = (143,922.03 / 16,071,961.015) × 100% ≈ 0.90%\n\n4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is computed as follows:\n  Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit\n\nUsing:\n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –4,510,837.08  \n  Net Profit = 143,922.03  \nThen:\n  Ratio = –4,510,837.08 / 143,922.03 ≈ –31.34\n\n5. Net Profit Margin measures net profit as a percentage of revenue:\n  Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n  Net Profit = 143,922.03  \n  Total Revenue = 851,679.79  \nThus,\n  Net Profit Margin = (143,922.03 / 851,679.79) × 100% ≈ 16.90%\n\n6. Gross Profit Margin is given by:\n  Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\n\nThe income statement shows:\n  Gross Profit = 308,309.79  \n  Total Revenue = 851,679.79  \nTherefore,\n  Gross Profit Margin = (308,309.79 / 851,679.79) × 100% ≈ 36.19%\n\nThe final solution in the requested JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-4762630.10\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"0.81%\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"0.90%\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-31.34\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"16.90%\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"36.19%\"\n  }\n}",
