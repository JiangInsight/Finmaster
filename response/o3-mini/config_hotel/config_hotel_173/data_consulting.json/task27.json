                        "content": "We begin by identifying the relevant numbers from the provided statements.\n\nStep 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n• From the cash‐flow statement, the “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities” is –4,510,837.08.\n• From the income statement, the “Net Profit” is 143,922.03.\n\nThus, the ratio is computed as:\n  Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Net Profit)\n      = (–4,510,837.08) / (143,922.03)\n      ≈ –31.35\n\n(Note: In the example both values were negative so the ratio turned positive. Here, with a positive net profit and negative operating cash flow, the ratio is negative.)\n\nStep 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\nHere we use Total Revenue from the income statement and average current assets from the balance sheet.\n\n• Total Revenue is 851,679.79.\n• The “Total Current Assets” at the beginning (2023‑12‑31) is 8,000,000.00 and at the end (2024‑02‑04) is 11,364,912.39.\n• Average Current Assets = (8,000,000.00 + 11,364,912.39) / 2 \n              = 19,364,912.39 / 2\n              ≈ 9,682,456.20\n\nThus, the Current Assets Turnover Ratio is:\n  Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Current Assets\n      ≈ 851,679.79 / 9,682,456.20 \n      ≈ 0.0879 \nRounded to two decimals: 0.09\n\nStep 3. Quick Ratio\n\nQuick assets are those that can be converted into cash quickly (i.e. Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, and Accounts Receivable), excluding Inventory.\n\nFrom the ending balance sheet:\n • Cash on Hand = 1,254,762.92\n • Bank Deposits = 1,982,606.98\n • Interest Receivable = 7,775.44\n • Accounts Receivable = 335,967.05\n\nCalculate the sum of Quick Assets:\n Quick Assets = 1,254,762.92 + 1,982,606.98 + 7,775.44 + 335,967.05 \n         = 3,237,369.90 + 7,775.44 + 335,967.05 \n         = 3,245,145.34 + 335,967.05 \n         ≈ 3,581,112.39\n\nAlso, Total Current Liabilities (ending) is given as 3,376,304.04.\n\nThus, the Quick Ratio is:\n  Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Total Current Liabilities \n      ≈ 3,581,112.39 / 3,376,304.04 \n      ≈ 1.06\n\nFinal Answers rounded to two decimals:\n\n• Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: –31.35  \n• Current Assets Turnover Ratio: 0.09  \n• Quick Ratio: 1.06\n\nNow, we provide the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-31.35\",\n    \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.09\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.06\"\n  }\n}",
