The Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is provided in the cash flow statement as –4,510,837.08.\n2. The “debt” here is taken from the balance sheet as the total current liabilities (the sum of Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable), which is 3,376,304.04.\n\nThen the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is computed as:\n  Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Current Liabilities)\n  Ratio = –4,510,837.08 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ –1.34\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.34'} }",
