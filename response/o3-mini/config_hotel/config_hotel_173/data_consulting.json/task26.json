Return on Equity (ROE) is calculated using the net profit and the average owner’s equity. Using the beginning and ending owner’s equity:\n\n  Average Owner’s Equity = (Beginning Owner’s Equity + Ending Owner’s Equity) / 2  \n  = (16000000.00 + 16143922.03) / 2  \n  = 32143922.03 / 2  \n  = 16071961.015\n\n  Net Profit (from the income statement) = 143922.03\n\n  ROE = Net Profit / Average Owner’s Equity  \n  = 143922.03 / 16071961.015  \n  ≈ 0.00895 or 0.895% (approximately)\n\n2. Debt to Asset Ratio is computed as total liabilities divided by total assets. From the balance sheet the only liabilities provided are the current liabilities.  \n  Total Liabilities = Total Assets – Owner’s Equity  \n  = 19520226.07 – 16143922.03  \n  = 3376304.04\n\n  Debt to Asset Ratio = Liabilities / Total Assets  \n  = 3376304.04 / 19520226.07  \n  ≈ 0.17296 or about 0.17\n\n3. Gross Profit Margin is given by the Gross Profit divided by Total Revenue:\n  Gross Profit = 308309.79  \n  Total Revenue = 851679.79\n\n  Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Total Revenue  \n  = 308309.79 / 851679.79  \n  ≈ 0.3618 or 36.18%\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"0.89%\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.17\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"36.18%\"\n  }\n}",
