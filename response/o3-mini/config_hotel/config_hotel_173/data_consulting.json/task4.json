The only liabilities provided are:\n • Accounts Payable: 3,333,720.00  \n • Taxes Payable: 42,584.04  \nTotal Liabilities = 3,333,720.00 + 42,584.04 = 3,376,304.04\n\nStep 2: Identify total owner's equity. From the balance sheet, Total Owner's Equity is given as 16,143,922.03.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio.\n Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity  \n = 3,376,304.04 / 16,143,922.03  \n ≈ 0.209 (which rounds to 0.21)\n\nThus, the Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.21.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21'}}",
