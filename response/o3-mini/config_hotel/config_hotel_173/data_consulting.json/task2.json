In this balance sheet, they include:\n• Cash on Hand\n• Bank Deposits\n• Interest Receivable\n• Accounts Receivable\n\nStep 2: Compute the sum of quick assets (using End_amounts):\n• Cash on Hand = 1,254,762.92\n• Bank Deposits = 1,982,606.98\n• Interest Receivable = 7,775.44\n• Accounts Receivable = 335,967.05\nSum of quick assets = 1,254,762.92 + 1,982,606.98 + 7,775.44 + 335,967.05 = 3,581,112.39\n\nStep 3: Identify Current Liabilities (from End_amounts):\n• Accounts Payable = 3,333,720.00\n• Taxes Payable = 42,584.04\nTotal Current Liabilities = 3,333,720.00 + 42,584.04 = 3,376,304.04\n\nStep 4: Calculate Quick Ratio:\nQuick Ratio = (Quick Assets) / (Current Liabilities)\nQuick Ratio = 3,581,112.39 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ 1.06\n\nThus, the Quick Ratio as of the end of the reporting period is approximately 1.06.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Quick Ratio\": \"1.06\"}\n}",
