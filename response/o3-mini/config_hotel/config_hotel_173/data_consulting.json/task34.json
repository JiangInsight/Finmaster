                        "content": "We first extract the key figures from the provided statements. Note that many of these ratios are computed using end‐period balances; in the case of ratios such as Return on Equity (ROE) and Accounts Receivable Turnover, the “average” balance is used (for accounts where beginning balance is zero, the average is half of the end‐balance).\n\nStep 1. Extract key values\n\n• From the Balance Sheet (at 2024‑02‑04):\n  – Cash on Hand = 1,254,762.92  \n  – Bank Deposits = 1,982,606.98  \n  – Interest Receivable = 7,775.44  \n  – Accounts Receivable = 335,967.05  \n  – Inventory = 7,783,800.00  \n  – Total Current Assets = 11,364,912.39  \n  – Fixed Assets = 8,251,793.02  \n  – Accumulated Depreciation = 96,479.34  \n  – Total Non-current Assets = 8,155,313.68  \n  – Total Assets = 19,520,226.07  \n  – Accounts Payable = 3,333,720.00  \n  – Taxes Payable = 42,584.04  \n  – Total Current Liabilities = 3,376,304.04  \n  – Paid‑in Capital = 16,000,000.00  \n  – Retained Earnings = 143,922.03  \n  – Total Owner’s Equity = 16,143,922.03  \n\nWe can (if needed) compute total liabilities as:\n  Total Liabilities = Total Assets – Owner’s Equity  \n    = 19,520,226.07 – 16,143,922.03 = 3,376,304.04  \n(which equals the current liabilities since no non‑current liability is given).\n\n• From the Cash Flow Statement (2024‑02‑04):\n  – Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –4,510,837.08\n\n• From the Income Statement (2024‑02‑04):\n  – Total Revenue = 851,679.79  \n  – Net Profit = 143,922.03\n\nStep 2. Compute the ratios\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n  = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Current Liabilities)  \n  = –4,510,837.08 / 3,376,304.04  \n  ≈ –1.335 → –1.34\n\n2. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n  = (Total Liabilities) / (Total Owner’s Equity)  \n  = 3,376,304.04 / 16,143,922.03  \n  ≈ 0.209 → 0.21\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n  = (Total Revenue) / (Total Assets)  \n  = 851,679.79 / 19,520,226.07  \n  ≈ 0.0436 → 0.04\n\n4. Quick Ratio  \n  Quick Assets are typically Cash equivalents plus receivables (inventory is excluded). Here we sum:\n   Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable  \n  = 1,254,762.92 + 1,982,606.98 + 7,775.44 + 335,967.05  \n  = 3,581,112.39 (approximately)  \n  Then:  \n  Quick Ratio = 3,581,112.39 / 3,376,304.04  \n  ≈ 1.0604 → 1.06\n\n5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n  In many cases this is the same as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio. Thus, it is –1.34\n\n6. Return on Equity (ROE)  \n  ROE = (Net Profit) / (Average Owner’s Equity)  \n  Average Owner’s Equity = (Beginning Equity + End Equity) / 2  \n    = (16,000,000.00 + 16,143,922.03) / 2  \n    ≈ 16,071,961.02  \n  Hence, ROE = 143,922.03 / 16,071,961.02  \n  ≈ 0.00896 or about 0.90%\n\n7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n  Usually calculated as (Total Revenue) / (Average Accounts Receivable).  \n  Since beginning Accounts Receivable is 0 and end is 335,967.05, the average is:  \n  Average Accounts Receivable = 335,967.05 / 2 = 167,983.53  \n  Thus, AR Turnover = 851,679.79 / 167,983.53  \n  ≈ 5.07\n\nStep 3. Present the final answers in JSON format\n\nThe final answers are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.34\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.21\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.04\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.06\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.34\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"0.90%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"5.07\"\n  }\n}",
