                        "content": "We first extract the key figures from the provided statements:\n\n1. Accounts Receivable – from the balance sheet, the ending Accounts Receivable is 335,967.05. Since there is no beginning balance (assumed 0), the average accounts receivable is (0 + 335,967.05)/2 = 167,983.525.  \n Main Business Revenue from the income statement is 851,679.79.\n\n Thus, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is:\n  = Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n  = 851,679.79 / 167,983.525  \n  ≈ 5.07\n\n2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio – Both ratios are defined as Operating Cash Flow divided by Current Liabilities. From the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is –4,510,837.08 and from the balance sheet the ending Total Current Liabilities are 3,376,304.04.\n\n So the ratio is:\n  = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n  = –4,510,837.08 / 3,376,304.04  \n  ≈ –1.335, which rounds to –1.34\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio – This is calculated as Revenue divided by the average Total Assets. The beginning Total Assets from the balance sheet are 16,000,000.00 and the ending Total Assets are 19,520,226.07. The average Total Assets is:\n  = (16,000,000.00 + 19,520,226.07) / 2  \n  = 35,520,226.07 / 2  \n  = 17,760,113.035\n\n Using the revenue of 851,679.79, we have:\n  = Revenue / Average Total Assets  \n  = 851,679.79 / 17,760,113.04  \n  ≈ 0.0479, which rounds to 0.05\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio – With balance sheet values the Total Owner’s Equity is given as 16,143,922.03. The total liabilities can be determined by subtracting Owner’s Equity from Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity:\n  Total Liabilities = Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity – Owner’s Equity  \n  = 19,520,226.07 – 16,143,922.03  \n  = 3,376,304.04\n\n Thus, the Debt to Equity Ratio is:\n  = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity  \n  = 3,376,304.04 / 16,143,922.03  \n  ≈ 0.209, which rounds to 0.21\n\nNow we put these results in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"5.07\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-1.34\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.34\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.05\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.21\"\n  }\n}",
