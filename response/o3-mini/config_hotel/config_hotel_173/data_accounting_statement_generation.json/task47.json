subsequent transactions (only those “Paid” by cash (or “Paid” via a bank transfer which immediately reduces our liquid funds) – note that for sales we consider only those where the receipt was made

(All “Unpaid” entries, “Account Receivable” and noncash items such as Depreciation are omitted.)\n\nThe net cash change (inflow minus outflow) is therefore:\n  515,712.74 – 4,970,152.07 = –4,454,439.33\n\nThus, the ending cash and cash equivalents balance is:\n  Initial 8,000,000.00 + (–4,454,439.33) ≈ 3,545,560.67\n\nPresenting the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"3545560.67\"} }\n``` \n\nNote: The values have been carefully summed taking only those transactions where funds actually leave or enter the cash accounts (i.e. “Paid” transactions using Cash or Bank Transfer in deposits or sales receipts).",
