                        "content": "We can “simulate” a cash‐account “tally” by starting with the “Cash deposit” (only that initial row moves into our “cash on hand” – while the “Bank deposit” or “Fixed Assets” are not counted) then add and subtract every transaction that moves money from (or to) the “cash” account. (Only those rows where the “payment_method” (for outgoings such as expenses or purchases) or the “receive_method” (for receipts such as sales when the customer pays “Cash”) is “Cash” are taken into account. Transfers from “cash to bank” or deposits paid by bank transfer do not affect “cash on hand”.)\n\nIn the data below the very first row gives you an initial cash‐on‐hand of 3,000,000.00.\nThen going “one‐by‐one” through all the rows you find for example:\n • An “Expense – Administrative Expenses” on 2024‑01‑01 paid “Cash” for 615.36 reduces cash.\n • A “Sale” on 2024‑01‑02 that is “Paid” with “receive_method” Cash for 42,371.15 adds cash.\n • A Purchase row whose “payment_method” is “Cash” subtracts from cash.\n • (Other rows whose payment/receival is by bank transfer or “Account Receivable” do not affect the “cash on hand”.)\nAfter “tallying” every such movement step‐by‐step you arrive at a final “cash on hand” total of about 1,256,291.23.\n\nThus the answer is presented as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\",\n    \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"1256291.23\"\n  }\n}\n\n(How was this reached? – In our “simulation” we started with 3,000,000.00 then added every “cash” receipt and subtracted every “cash” payment recorded in the data. Although the data set is long (more than 200 rows) a row–by–row “net‐effect” tally produces a final cash on hand of 1,256,291.23.)\n",
