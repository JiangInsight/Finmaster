                        "content": "We can “build” a net‐profit number by adding together the “profit” amounts from all the sale transactions and then “adjusting” for the “expense‐side” flows (expenses, depreciation, etc) – also “adding” any interest income from Interest Receivables. (Other kinds of purchase or deposit rows affect the balance but are “balance‐sheet” events and not “profit” items.) \n\nFor example, in the above dataset we may “accumulate” the following figures (all numbers here are in monetary units):\n\n1. The “Sale” rows each list a “profit” value. When these values are added up we obtain approximately 294,682.40.\n\n2. The “Expense” rows – including the various administrative, sales and financial expenses as well as the “Depreciation” rows – add up to about 126,435.74.\n\n3. Separately, the “Interest Receivables” rows (which appear as positive income although not always “collected”) sum up to about 7,775.64.\n\nThen the final net‐profit is computed as\n\n  Net profit = (total sale profit) + (total interest income) − (total expenses)\n        ≈ 294,682.40 + 7,775.64 – 126,435.74 \n        ≈ 302,458.04 – 126,435.74 \n        ≈ 176,022.30\n\nThus the “final net profit” item would come out to approximately 176,022.30.\n\nBelow is the final answer in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"176022.30\"} }\n```",
