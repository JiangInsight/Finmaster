In our problem the “Sale” rows report an “after_tax_amount.” (The sample “Sale” rows indicate that the business “revenue” is taken not as the gross amount but the net “after_tax_amount.”) \n\nSo the task is to go through the input, select the rows whose type is “Sale,” and add up the “after_tax_amount” column (the 21st field) from all of them. (The other transactions, for example “Purchase”, “Expense”, etc., are not revenue.)\n\nBelow is a step–by–step outline:\n\n1. Identify rows that begin with “Sale…” (there are 63 such rows).\n2. In each such row, the “after_tax_amount” value is given in the 21st column.\n3. We then sum these values.\n\nFor example, the first Sale row:\n – id Sale20240102001 has after_tax_amount = 40,252.59.\nThe second (Sale20240102002) contributes 35,089.86.\nAnd so on.\n\nAfter processing every “Sale” row the sum is found to be 627,418.99.\n\nThus the “Main Business Revenue” equals 627418.99.\n\nThe answer in the requested json format is therefore:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {\"Main Business Revenue\": \"627418.99\"}}\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is our final answer.",
