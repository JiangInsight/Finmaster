                        "content": "We must “build” the fixed assets item by first taking the original “Fixed Assets” value from the initial entry and then adding any capital expenditures (asset purchases) that are meant to add to the fixed asset cost. (Depreciation – although it appears in the transactions – is recorded separately in the books and does not reduce the historical cost that appears on the “Fixed Assets” account.) \n\nIn the sample data the initial fixed asset entry was 5,000,000.00 and a “Fixed Assets Purchase” of 305,354.43 was added. The “Fixed Assets End Value” then came to 5,000,000.00 + 305,354.43 = 5,305,354.43.\n\nIn our problem the transactions include:\n1. An initial fixed assets entry on 2023‑12‑31 with amount 8,000,000.0.\n2. A “Fixed Assets Purchase” transaction (id FixedAsset20231231001) with amount 251,793.02.\n\nEven though there are depreciation transactions later, the sample solution did not subtract them from fixed assets cost. Therefore we use the same approach:\n • Fixed Assets Initial Value = 8,000,000.00  \n • Fixed Assets End Value = 8,000,000.00 + 251,793.02 = 8,251,793.02\n\nThus the answer is as follows.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"8251793.02\"}}\n```",
