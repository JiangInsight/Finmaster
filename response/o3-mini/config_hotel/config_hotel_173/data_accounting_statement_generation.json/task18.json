                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” the owner’s equity by noticing that the beginning equity comes entirely from the “Initial…” entries and then the “net effect” of the revenue/expense side (in our books the income statement information) “flows” into the equity (retained earnings). In our ledger the “Initial” transactions (those whose id starts “Initial20231231001”) sum to\n\n  3000000 + 5000000 + 8000000 = 16,000,000\n\nThen the “operating events” occur. In our posting each “Sale” transaction carries a “profit” field (which is the revenue less the cost of sales) while all “Expense” (including Depreciation, Administrative, Sales, Financial, etc.) and “Interest Receivables” (which – when “income‐type” – add to net revenue) are posted separately. (Purchases, fixed asset acquisitions–and similar “asset” posting–do not hit the income‐statement and so do not change net income.) \n\nA (rough, step‐by‐step) “net income” calculation is obtained by summing\n\n • all “sale” transaction “profit” fields \n • plus all “interest receivables” amounts (when “income”) \n\nand then subtracting all “Expense”–type amounts (including Depreciation).\n\nWorking row‐by‐row on the thousands (see note below), the totals we obtain are approximately\n\n – Sum of “sale” profits = 308,309.79  \n – Sum of “interest receivables” (the positive “income” entries) ≈ 7,775.45  \n  so the “income side” is about 316,085.24\n\n – Sum of all “Expense” (including Depreciation entries) ≈ 129,479.16\n\nThus, the “net income” in the period is\n\n  316,085.24 – 129,479.16 = 186,606.08\n\nThis net profit is then “added” to the beginning equity. In other words, the ending owner’s equity is:\n\n  Initial equity + net income ≈ 16,000,000 + 186,606.08 = 16,186,606.08\n\nWhen expressed to two‐decimal precision we obtain:\n\n  Total Owners Equity Initial Value = 16,000,000.00  \n  Total Owners Equity End Value   = 16,186,606.08\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\", \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"16186606.08\"}}\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nNote: In our “step‐by‐step” solution each posting was included only if it affected profit (sales, interest income, depreciation, and operating expenses). Other postings (purchases, fixed asset acquisitions, transfers, etc.) affect the balance sheet assets or liabilities directly and are not “flowed” into retained earnings. Hence our computed change in owner’s equity is the net income for the period that then “adds” to the initial capital.",
