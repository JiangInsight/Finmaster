                        "content": "We must “construct” the balance‐sheet “liability” “item” by adding up only those transactions that create an obligation on the company. In our chart the “Initial” entries are asset entries (cash, bank, fixed assets) so no liability is set up at time‑0 (initial value is 0). Then “Purchase” transactions that were “Unpaid” and recorded with a payment method (for example, “Account Payable”) are “liability” entries because the business has not yet paid for them.\n\nLooking at the list we note the following Purchase transactions that are still unpaid (the “payment/receipt_status” is “Unpaid” and the “payment_method” shows “Account Payable”):\n\n• Purchase20231231002 – Amount = 1,495,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231008 – Amount = 21,150.00  \n• Purchase20231231010 – Amount = 256,080.00  \n• Purchase20231231015 – Amount = 39,900.00  \n• Purchase20231231016 – Amount = 46,550.00  \n• Purchase20231231017 – Amount = 97,650.00  \n• Purchase20231231020 – Amount = 524,160.00  \n• Purchase20231231021 – Amount = 15,150.00  \n• Purchase20231231022 – Amount = 838,080.00\n\nLet’s sum these numbers:\n\n 1,495,000.00  \n+    21,150.00 = 1,516,150.00  \n+   256,080.00 = 1,772,230.00  \n+    39,900.00 = 1,812,130.00  \n+    46,550.00 = 1,858,680.00  \n+    97,650.00 = 1,956,330.00  \n+   524,160.00 = 2,470,490.00  \n+    15,150.00 = 2,485,640.00  \n+   838,080.00 = 3,323,720.00\n\nThus the “final” liabilities (that is, outstanding unpaid obligations) total 3,323,720.00.\n\nBecause none of the “Initial” transactions established any liability the initial liabilities are 0.00.\n\nSo the answer we provide in the required json format is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"3323720.00\"} }",
