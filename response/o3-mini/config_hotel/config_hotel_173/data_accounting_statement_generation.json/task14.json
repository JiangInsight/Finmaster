                        "content": "We must “build” the current‐liabilities figure from the transactions by “picking out” those entries that increased a “payable” balance – namely, purchase transactions that were entered as “Unpaid” and which use an “Account Payable” payment method. (All of the “Initial” entries simply create assets, and none of the expenses or sales data add to current liabilities.) \n\nIn the data the following purchase entries are “Unpaid” (thus “owing money” and counted as current liabilities):\n\n1. Purchase20231231002  \n  Amount = 1,495,000.00  \n  (Payment Method = Account Payable)\n\n2. Purchase20231231008  \n  Amount = 21,150.00  \n  (Account Payable)\n\n3. Purchase20231231010  \n  Amount = 256,080.00  \n  (Account Payable)\n\n4. Purchase20231231015  \n  Amount = 39,900.00  \n  (Account Payable)\n\n5. Purchase20231231016  \n  Amount = 46,550.00  \n  (Account Payable)\n\n6. Purchase20231231017  \n  Amount = 97,650.00  \n  (Account Payable)\n\n7. Purchase20231231020  \n  Amount = 524,160.00  \n  (Account Payable)\n\n8. Purchase20231231021  \n  Amount = 15,150.00  \n  (Account Payable)\n\n9. Purchase20231231022  \n  Amount = 838,080.00  \n  (Account Payable)\n\nWe now add these (note: money amounts are taken from the “amount” column):\n\n • 1,495,000.00  \n+ 21,150.00  \n= 1,516,150.00\n\n+ 256,080.00  \n= 1,772,230.00\n\n+ 39,900.00  \n= 1,812,130.00\n\n+ 46,550.00  \n= 1,858,680.00\n\n+ 97,650.00  \n= 1,956,330.00\n\n+ 524,160.00  \n= 2,480,490.00\n\n+ 15,150.00  \n= 2,495,640.00\n\n+ 838,080.00  \n= 3,333,720.00\n\nNone of the “Initial” transactions (which date 2023‑12‑31) create any liabilities – they set up assets only. (For example, the bank and cash deposits and the fixed asset purchase are asset side entries.) Therefore, the “starting” (or “initial”) current liabilities answer is zero.\n\nThus, in our final balance‐sheet–figures the current liabilities initially are 0.00 and at the “end” (after all transactions) the current liabilities – based solely on the “unpaid” purchase amounts – equal 3,333,720.00.\n\nWe now present the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"3333720.00\"\n  }\n}",
