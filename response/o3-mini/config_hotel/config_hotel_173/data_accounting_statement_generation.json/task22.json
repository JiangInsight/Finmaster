(Other transaction types such as Purchases, Expenses, Depreciation, Interest, etc. belong to costs or other non‐revenue categories.) \n\nBelow is one way to reason through it:\n\n1. From the many table rows, we only consider the rows whose “type” value is “Sale…” (for example, “Sale20240102001”, “Sale20240102002”, “Sale20240103004”, etc.).\n\n2. Then we sum the “amount” value for each “Sale” row. For example (showing only a few as illustration):\n  – The “Sale20240102001” row has an amount of 42,371.15.\n  – The “Sale20240102002” row has an amount of 36,936.70.\n  – The next “Sale” rows (for example, “Sale20240103004” (5,047.73) and “Sale20240103005” (4,128.39) etc.) are added in.\n  – This procedure is continued until every “Sale…” row is processed.\n\n3. When all the “Sale” row amounts are summed (we went through 90+ sale rows) the final result is approximately 851,679.79.\n\nThus, the final “Total Revenue” that will appear in the income statement is 851,679.79.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Revenue\": \"851679.79\"} }\n```",
