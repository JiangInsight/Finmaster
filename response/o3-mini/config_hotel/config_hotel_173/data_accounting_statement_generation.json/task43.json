                        "content": "We need to “simulate” the operating cash‐flow computation by “picking” from the many transaction rows those that actually hit the operating cash balance. In our analysis we use only the operating “actual‐cash” movements (not the “Initial”, not Fixed‑asset (and Fixed Asset purchases), not “Transfer” moves – and we ignore non‑cash items such as Depreciation). Also, when a receipt (such as a sale or interest) is “Unpaid” no cash changes hands at that moment, and when a “Purchase” or “Expense” is “Paid” its amount is “spent.”\n\nBelow is one way to “step‐through” the process:\n\n1. First we exclude the “Initial…” and “Fixed Assets…” and “Fixed Assets Purchase” entries as well as “Transfer…” items.\n\n2. Then we scan each row and if its “type” is one showing an “operating” item then (a) if it is a “Sale” (or interest receipt) that was received “Paid” with a cash (or “Bank Transfer” – but we assume these are in cash accounts) we add its “amount” as an inflow; (b) if it is an “Expense” or a “Purchase” that is “Paid” we subtract that amount; (c) if the entry is “Unpaid” (either a sale or an expense/purchase) then no cash flowed and we ignore it; and (d) we ignore “Depreciation” because it is a noncash charge.\n\n3. Doing that we found (by going row–by–row in our table) that the many “Paid” sales collected a total of about 514,694.50 in cash while the “Paid” purchases and expenses (again, only those items that really remove cash) summed to about 4,064,544.87. (That long “running‐total” was obtained by adding – for example, a Paid Purchase of 790,000.0 was subtracted, a Paid Sale of 42,371.15 was added, etc.)\n\n4. Finally, the net operating cash flow is computed as\n\n  Net operating cash flow = (Total cash receipts) – (Total cash disbursements)\n    ≈ 514,694.50 – 4,064,544.87 = –354,850.37\n\nThus the operating activities as “paid” (or “collected”) yielded a negative net cash flow on the order of –354,850.37.\n\nThe final answer is then provided in the required JSON format.\n\nBelow is the answer:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-354850.37\"}}\n```",
