(For example, one sale row shows tax_amount = 2118.56, another 1846.84, etc.)\n\nA careful (step‐by‐step) scan of the “Sale” rows (see “Sale20240102001”, “Sale20240102002”, “Sale20240103004”, “Sale20240103005”, “Sale20240104007”, … etc.) shows that when you add up (sum) all the tax_amount numbers from all the sale transactions, you get a value of approximately 42,760.18.\n\nThus the “Taxes Payable Initial Value” is 0.00 and the “Taxes Payable End Value” is 42760.18.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"42760.18\"} }",
