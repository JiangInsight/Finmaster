                        "content": "We can “simulate” the calculation in our head by first noticing that only some rows – in our case the Sales transactions – have a non‐empty “tax_amount” value. (Other types – cash deposits, expense items, purchases, etc.– do not contribute to the “tax expense” item.) One then “adds up” the tax amounts from each sale record.\n\nFor example, from the first few sales you have:\n\n• Sale20240102001: tax_amount = 2118.56  \n• Sale20240102002: tax_amount = 1846.84  \n• Sale20240103004: tax_amount = 252.39  \n• Sale20240103005: tax_amount = 206.42  \n• Sale20240104007: tax_amount = 349.06  \n\n…and so on throughout the entire table. (There are more than 100 sales; each sale record carries a “tax_amount” in column #20.) \n\nBy “walking through” all records and summing the sale tax_amount values – step‐by‐step grouping the amounts as follows:\n\n1. 2118.56 + 1846.84 + 252.39 + 206.42 + 349.06 = 4773.27  \n2. Then adding the tax values from the next series of sales (e.g. 40.66, 683.64, 1096.82, 503.83, 406.95) gives an additional 2731.90 so that now the running total is 7505.17.  \n3. Continuing in similar groups you eventually add (by careful summation) the following group–by–group amounts:\n  – Group totals: 4002.05, 2011.29, 932.50, 448.58, 2196.64, 1658.01, 931.05, 936.82, 1812.03, 91.12, 697.07, 1288.14, 1067.30, 2105.71, 165, 60.76, 1143.50, 1292.01, 565.84, 1085.28, 1304.24, 1027.66, 641.11, 539.37, 141.79, 1206.63, 302.20, 674.51, 487.31, 106.09, 637.83, 1662.16, 361.80, 574.60, 195.21, 320.29, 209.78, 52.07, and finally 143.31.\nWhen all these are summed the grand total becomes 42,583.83.\n\nThus the “Tax Expense” item for the income statement (based on the transactions’ tax amounts) is 42,583.83.\n\nThe answer in the desired JSON format is therefore:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Tax Expense\": \"42583.83\"\n  }\n}",
