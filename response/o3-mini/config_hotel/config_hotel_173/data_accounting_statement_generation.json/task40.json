                        "content": "We need to “build” the inventory account here by “adding” all the purchases (which bring inventory onto the balance‐sheet) and “reducing” the cost of the sales (which “use” inventory). That is, in the cash–flow statement the working–capital adjustment for inventory is:\n  Final inventory = Total purchases – Cost of inventory sold\n\nStep 1. Sum all the Purchase transaction amounts. In our table the Purchase rows (by their id beginning with Purchase20231231001 up to Purchase20231231023) have been recorded as follows (all amounts given on the “amount” column):\n\n  • Purchase20231231001:  790,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231002: 1,495,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231003: 374,400.00  \n  • Purchase20231231004: 1,340,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231005: 146,080.00  \n  • Purchase20231231006: 444,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231007: 154,500.00  \n  • Purchase20231231008: 21,150.00  \n  • Purchase20231231009: 34,350.00  \n  • Purchase20231231010: 256,080.00  \n  • Purchase20231231011: 21,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231012: 95,920.00  \n  • Purchase20231231013: 409,500.00  \n  • Purchase20231231014: 432,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231015: 39,900.00  \n  • Purchase20231231016: 46,550.00  \n  • Purchase20231231017: 97,650.00  \n  • Purchase20231231018: 448,500.00  \n  • Purchase20231231019: 222,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231020: 524,160.00  \n  • Purchase20231231021: 15,150.00  \n  • Purchase20231231022: 838,080.00  \n  • Purchase20231231023: 81,200.00\n\nWhen we add these up we obtain a total purchase cost of 8,327,170.00.\n\nStep 2. Next, each Sale transaction “removes” inventory by using up the cost (rather than the sale price) – that value is in the “cost_amount” column. (For example, one sale – Sale20240102001 – “sold” 5 Luxury Suites and the cost_amount recorded is 25,000.00.) When we add the cost_amount for every Sale row in the table the sum (after going row‐by‐row through all over 80 sale entries) is found to be 495,830.00.\n\nStep 3. Therefore, the ending (final) inventory cost (the stock of items on‐hand) is the Purchases minus Cost of Goods Sold:\n  8,327,170.00 – 495,830.00 = 7,831,340.00\n\nIn a cash‐flow statement this inventory “investment” is shown as an outflow (a use of cash). Hence we report it as a “decrease” in cash (or an “increase” in inventory) by a negative amount. (Recall that if inventory increases by spending more cash, the cash–flow item is “(Increase) in Inventory” shown in parentheses.)\n\nThus the final answer is that the “(Increase) Decrease in Inventory” should be –7,831,340.00.\n\nThe answer in the required json output format is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-7831340.00\"}}\n--------------------------------------------------------",
