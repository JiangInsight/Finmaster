                        "content": "We need to “build” the accounts–payable balance from the transactions. In our books only the “Purchase” transactions affect this liability. In particular, when an invoice is recorded as “Unpaid” and the payment method is “Account Payable” (or simply the payment/receipt status is Unpaid with a method that implies a liability) the amount will add to the balance. (In contrast, if the purchase is “Paid” the cash or bank is used and no accounts payable is created.) \n\nLooking at the transaction “Purchase” rows (ignoring the many sales, expenses, fixed asset, depreciation, etc.) we find that the following purchase transactions are unpaid and posted via “Account Payable” (or “Unpaid” transaction when the payment method supports recording AP):\n\n1. Purchase20231231002 – Unpaid, amount = 1,495,000.00  \n2. Purchase20231231008 – Unpaid, amount = 21,150.00  \n3. Purchase20231231010 – Unpaid, amount = 256,080.00  \n4. Purchase20231231015 – Unpaid, amount = 39,900.00  \n5. Purchase20231231016 – Unpaid, amount = 46,550.00  \n6. Purchase20231231017 – Unpaid, amount = 97,650.00  \n7. Purchase20231231020 – Unpaid, amount = 524,160.00  \n8. Purchase20231231021 – Unpaid, amount = 15,150.00  \n9. Purchase20231231022 – Unpaid, amount = 838,080.00  \n\nNow, summing these amounts step‐by‐step:\n\n• 1,495,000.00 + 21,150.00 = 1,516,150.00  \n• 1,516,150.00 + 256,080.00 = 1,772,230.00  \n• 1,772,230.00 + 39,900.00 = 1,812,130.00  \n• 1,812,130.00 + 46,550.00 = 1,858,680.00  \n• 1,858,680.00 + 97,650.00 = 1,956,330.00  \n• 1,956,330.00 + 524,160.00 = 2,480,490.00  \n• 2,480,490.00 + 15,150.00 = 2,495,640.00  \n• 2,495,640.00 + 838,080.00 = 3,333,720.00  \n\nThus the net (increase in) Accounts Payable is 3,333,720.00. \n\nWe now present the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"3333720.00\"\n  }\n}",
