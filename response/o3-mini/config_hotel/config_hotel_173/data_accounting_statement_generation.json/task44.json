In these transactions the “Fixed Assets Purchase” record is used solely for such acquisitions. In our table you can see that the only row with a type indicating a fixed asset purchase is:\n\n • FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | … | amount 251793.02\n\nIgnoring other transactions (for example, the “Initial” entries are for setting up accounts and the “Purchase” entries on other rows refer to operational items like “Luxury Suite,” “Banquet Set,” etc.), the final purchase of fixed assets is 251793.02.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"251793.02\"\n  }\n}",
