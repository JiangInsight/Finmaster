Only “Sale” transactions (using their “after_tax_amount” field) are taken as revenue. Adding up every sale’s after‐tax collected amount gives a total revenue of about 769587.26. (This is also regarded “Main Business Revenue”.)\n\n2. For each sale the “cost_amount” is assumed to be the cost of goods sold; the sum of these comes to 517370.00. In our model the “Cost of Goods Sold” and “Total Cost” are considered equal.\n\n3. The “Gross Profit” is the difference between revenue and cost – 769587.26 – 517370.00 = 252217.26.\n\n4. Operating expenses are summed from the various expense entries. Administrative expenses add up to 14884.34, Selling (sales) expenses to 9027.51, Depreciation (from two entries) to 96479.34 and Financial expenses to 2934.78. Their sum (i.e. “Total Expenses”) is 123325.97.\n\n5. The “Interest Income” is taken as the sum of all Interest Receivables entries (all are positive) which total 7775.44.\n\n6. The “Profit Before Tax” is then calculated as Gross Profit less Total Expenses plus Interest Income: 252217.26 – 123325.97 + 7775.44 = 136666.73.\n\n7. Assuming a tax charge of roughly 25% on taxable profit (here about 34166.68), the “Net Profit” is 136666.73 – 34166.68 = 102500.05.\n\nEach of these numbers has been rounded to two decimal places.\n",
