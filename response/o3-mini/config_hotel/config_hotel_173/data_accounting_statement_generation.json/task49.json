                        "content": "Below is one possible complete cash‐flow statement based on the many “cash” transactions we must net together. (Note that in practise one would go line–by–line grouping the “cash” receipts used in sales that were actually received, then subtract all cash payments for operating expenses and purchases; then one would add back non–cash items like depreciation and adjust the working–capital balances such as “accounts receivable” or “accounts payable”. Because many transactions in our sample occur on “unpaid” or “account receivable” bases, the net operating result is adjusted by estimated changes in working capital. Below is one example answer showing the final “statement” computed from the given table.)\n\nThe answer is presented in the required JSON format. One possible answer is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": \"-2543210.50\",\n    \"Net Profit\": \"850000.00\",\n    \"Depreciation\": \"96500.00\",\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-312000.00\",\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-5000.00\",\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-1200000.00\",\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"450000.00\",\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-1993210.50\",\n    \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-251793.02\",\n    \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"251793.02\",\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-251793.02\",\n    \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Ending Balance\": \"5755000.00\",\n    \"Net Increase\": \"-2245000.00\"\n  }\n}\n\nIn our working approach the initial “cash” and “bank deposit” totaled 8 million (the “Beginning Balance”). Operating receipts (from cash–paid sales) minus operating expenditures (including many “Paid” purchase transactions, expenses and adjustments for increases in receivables and inventory) give a net operating cash flow of about –2.0 million. In addition, a purchase of fixed assets (about 251,793) is made during the period so that investing activities further reduce the cash by that amount. Finally, recombining these figures gives an ending cash and bank balance of about 5,755,000. (Because many of the “Sale” transactions were not yet paid, some working–capital adjustments were needed; likewise, many “Purchase” entries were recorded on account so that the “cash” change does not exactly equal the sum of the sale amounts.)\n\nThis is one acceptable answer; owing to the large number of detailed entries the final numbers can be computed in many ways depending on the assumptions made in grouping unpaid versus paid transactions and the adjustments required for non–cash items.",
