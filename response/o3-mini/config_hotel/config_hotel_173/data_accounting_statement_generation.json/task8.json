In our “problem” data the only two lines with type “Depreciation” are:\n\n• Depreciation20240101001 on 2024‑01‑01 with an amount of 45741.99 (given as 45741.98999999999, which rounds to 45741.99)  \n• Depreciation20240201002 on 2024‑02‑01 with an amount of 50737.35  \n\nTypically an “accumulated depreciation” account starts at zero prior to the first depreciation entry. In our data no prior depreciation entries (or beginning balance) were given, so the accumulated depreciation “initial value” is 0.00.\n\nThen the end‐of‐period accumulated depreciation is the sum of all depreciation recognized during the period. In our case:\n\n 45741.99 + 50737.35 = 96479.34\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"96479.34\"\n  }\n}",
