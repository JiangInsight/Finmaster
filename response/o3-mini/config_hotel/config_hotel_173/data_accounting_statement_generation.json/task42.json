                        "content": "We can “recover” the tax‐liability from the sales transactions that include a non‐empty “tax_amount” – assuming that no tax payments were recorded (for example, no “tax remittance” entries) so that the tax liability increases by the total “tax_amount” collected in sales. (In practice, tax‐payable is computed as output VAT minus input VAT and any payments already made; here the only nonzero “tax_amount” entries are in the sales rows.) \n\nBelow you see one way to solve the problem:\n \n1. Go down the “Sale” transactions (they are the ones in which the “tax_amount” field is provided) and list each tax amount.\n2. Add all these tax amounts together.\n3. (Since no “tax remittance” – or offset – entries appear, the net increase in tax payable is equal to the total tax collected on sales.)\n\nFor example, when we add every “tax_amount” from the sale rows we obtain the following sum (here we show one “group‐by‐group” summary):\n\n • From the earliest sale rows the sums add up to about 7,505.17  \n • The next block of sale rows add about 6,013.34  \n • Then a block contributes about 1,381.08  \n • Then about 7,534.55  \n • Next about 5,414.34  \n • Then about 3,062.11  \n • Then about 4,597.66  \n • Then about 5,580.32  \n • And the remaining sale rows add about 1,495.26  \n\nWhen you add these partial sums the total is approximately 42,683.83.\n\nThus (assuming there was no beginning balance and no recorded tax payments) the cash‐flow “Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable” is an increase of about 42,683.83.\n\nWe now present the answer as requested:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"42683.83\"} }\n```",
