                        "content": "We start with a “Bank deposit” row that sets the initial bank deposit amount. In our data the only such row is\n\n  Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | … | amount = 5,000,000.00\n\nThen—using an “accounting‐style” approach—we look at every transaction that uses a bank‐transfer payment method (or otherwise is explicitly paid “by bank transfer” or “via bank”) because when the business makes a payment using its bank deposit the bank‑account is reduced by that amount. (Sales that are received by cash are not counted here; similarly, transactions paid “by Account Payable” do not immediately reduce the bank deposit.) \n\nLooking through the table we identify these transactions whose “payment_method” is “Bank Transfer” and which (when paid) reduce the bank deposit:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001 (Purchase, Paid by Bank Transfer):  amount = 790,000.00  \n2. Purchase20231231003 (Purchase, Paid by Bank Transfer):  amount = 374,400.00  \n3. Purchase20231231005 (Purchase, Paid by Bank Transfer):  amount = 146,080.00  \n4. Purchase20231231007 (Purchase, Paid by Bank Transfer):  amount = 154,500.00  \n5. Purchase20231231011 (Purchase, Paid by Bank Transfer):  amount = 21,000.00  \n6. Purchase20231231012 (Purchase, Paid by Bank Transfer):  amount = 95,920.00  \n7. FixedAsset20231231001 (Fixed Assets Purchase, Paid via Bank Transfer):  amount = 251,793.02  \n8. Purchase20231231014 (Purchase, Paid via Bank Transfer):  amount = 432,000.00  \n9. Purchase20231231018 (Purchase, Paid via Bank Transfer):  amount = 448,500.00  \n10. Purchase20231231019 (Purchase, Paid via Bank Transfer):  amount = 222,000.00  \n11. Purchase20231231023 (Purchase, Paid via Bank Transfer):  amount = 81,200.00\n\nWe now sum these bank‐paid amounts:\n\n  790,000.00  \n+ 374,400.00  = 1,164,400.00  \n+ 146,080.00  = 1,310,480.00  \n+ 154,500.00  = 1,464,980.00  \n+ 21,000.00   = 1,485,980.00  \n+ 95,920.00   = 1,581,900.00  \n+ 251,793.02  = 1,833,693.02  \n+ 432,000.00  = 2,265,693.02  \n+ 448,500.00  = 2,714,193.02  \n+ 222,000.00  = 2,936,193.02  \n+ 81,200.00   = 3,017,393.02\n\nThat is a total “bank‐transfer outflow” of 3,017,393.02. (All other transactions in the table either are paid by “cash”, “Account Payable”, “Unpaid” or otherwise have no direct effect on the bank deposit account.) \n\nThus the bank deposit (which is the “cash” held in the bank) decreases from the initial 5,000,000.00 by 3,017,393.02. In other words, the ending bank deposit is:\n\n  5,000,000.00 – 3,017,393.02 = 1,982,606.98\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n  Bank Deposits Initial Value: 5,000,000.00  \n  Bank Deposits End Value: 1,982,606.98\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON output format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Bank Deposits Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Bank Deposits End Value': '1982606.98'}}",
