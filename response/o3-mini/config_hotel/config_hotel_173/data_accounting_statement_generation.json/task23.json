In this example the approach was to determine the cost of each item sold – using the provided sales transactions. (Each sale line shows a “cost_amount” value that represents the cost incurred on that sale.) Then the overall cost‐of‐goods‐sold is computed as the sum of the “cost_amount” numbers on all sales rows. \n\nBelow is a brief outline of our reasoning:\n\n1. We looked at every transaction with type “Sale.”\n2. For each sale row the “cost_amount” column is provided (for example, one sale row shows cost_amount=25000.0, another shows 2880.0, etc.).\n3. By adding those cost amounts over all sales transactions we obtained the final total cost of goods sold.\n4. Summing all 79 sales–related “cost_amount” values yielded \n  497,330.00\n\nThus the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"497330.00\"}\n}",
