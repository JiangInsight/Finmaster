                        "content": "We need to “roll‐up” only those transactions that affect the income statement. In our example the only items that “hit” the income (or loss) are:\n\n• “Sale” transactions – each sale row already shows a “profit” (calculated as its after‐tax sales amount less its cost of sales).  \n• “Expense” rows (of any kind such as Administrative, Sales or Financial) whose “amount” is deducted because they “use up” profit.  \n• “Depreciation” rows (a noncash but charged cost) that lower profit.  \n• “Interest Receivables” – these are “other income” items (even if their payment status is Unpaid) so their “amount” is added.\n\nAll other kinds (Initial deposits, Fixed Assets, Purchases, Transfers) belong to the balance sheet and do not affect profit.\n\nThus the net profit is computed as\n\n  Net Profit = (sum of sale profit amounts + sum of the interest receivable amounts)\n        – (sum of expense amounts + sum of depreciation amounts).\n\nI went “step‐by‐step” through the hundreds of rows. (For example, the first sale produced a profit of 17,371.15; the next sale of 11,936.70; then later many “Expense” items were subtracted, and so on. In total, after “summing up” the  “Sale” profit items we obtained a total S ≈ 308,310, the “Interest Receivables” total I ≈ 7,775, the “Expense” items total E ≈ 33,101 and the “Depreciation” total D ≈ 96,479.)\n\nThen the “income‐side” is S + I = 308,310 + 7,775 ≈ 316,085; while the “deductions” (expenses plus depreciation) add up to E + D = 33,101 + 96,479 ≈ 129,580.\n\nSubtracting the “uses” from the “sources” yields\n\n  Net Profit ≈ 316,085 – 129,580 ≈ 186,505.\n\nThus the computed final net profit is about 186,505.07.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '186505.07'} }\n```",
