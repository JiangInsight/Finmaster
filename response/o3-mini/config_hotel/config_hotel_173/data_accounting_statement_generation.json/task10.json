                        "content": "We must include in non‐current assets only those “Fixed Assets” that appear on the balance sheet. In the given transactions the only two that affect the “property, plant and equipment” (non‐current assets) are:\n\n1. The initial “Fixed Assets” record (from the “Initial20231231001” row, type “Fixed Assets”) which shows an amount of 8,000,000.00.  \n2. An addition later recorded under a “Fixed Assets Purchase” (the row whose id is “FixedAsset20231231001” with amount 251,793.02) and asset name “Kitchen Equipment4.”\n\nThen, during the period depreciation is recorded. In the data there are two depreciation entries:\n• Depreciation on 2024‑01‑01 for 45,741.99  \n• Depreciation on 2024‑02‑01 for 50,737.35  \n\nTotal depreciation = 45,741.99 + 50,737.35 = 96,479.34\n\nWe then compute as follows:\n• Total Non‑current Assets Initial Value = 8,000,000.00  \n• Total acquisitions = 251,793.02  \n  so the “gross” accumulated assets become 8,000,000.00 + 251,793.02 = 8,251,793.02  \n• After subtracting total depreciation (96,479.34) the closing (end) value is  \n  8,251,793.02 − 96,479.34 = 8,155,313.68\n\nThus we report:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"8155313.68\"\n  }\n}",
