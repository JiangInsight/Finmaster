In our set the only transactions that represent buying or selling long‑term assets (such as property, plant, equipment, or other fixed assets) are the “Fixed Assets” entries. (In a cash‐flow statement, our “initial” opening‐balance records—such as “Cash deposit”, “Bank deposit” or an “Initial Fixed Assets” record—are not considered part of the period’s cash flows; they serve to set up the opening balances.) \n\nLooking over the list, the only transaction during the period that is of an “investing” nature is the one that shows\n  id = FixedAsset20231231001, type = “Fixed Assets Purchase” with an amount of 251793.02, and it is recorded as a “Paid” bank transfer.\n\nNo other transaction in the list represents a cash inflow from or an additional spending on fixed assets. (The many “Purchase” records in our data concern supplies, meals, or “Luxury Suite” items—that is, operating‐activity inventory and not fixed asset investment.)\n\nThus, the net cash flow from investing activities (the cash “used” in investing) is simply a cash outflow equal to –251793.02.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-251793.02\"\n  }\n}",
