                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” the ending balance of the “liabilities and owners’ equity” item by “starting” with the beginning balance (which in these simplified journals is the sum of the three “Initial…” entries) and then “adjusting” for the (net) effects of all operating transactions during the period. (In a more‐detailed accounting system the “assets” side would “balance” with “liabilities and owners’ equity” and only changes in net income – plus any new debt– affect that side.) \n\nIn our example problem the three “Initial…” entries are\n\n • Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00  \n • Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00  \n • Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.00\n\nso the “initial” total is\n\n  3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 8,000,000.00 = 16,000,000.00\n\nDuring the period many selling‐and‐purchasing and related transactions occur. In our simplified calculation one may “recover” the net change in owners’ equity by (a) adding up the “profit” shown (that is, the sale–cost amounts on all the “Sale” lines) and also adding any “interest revenue” (the “Interest Receivables” amounts that are recorded as income) – and then (b) subtracting the “operating expense” amounts (that is, all the “Expense…” rows – including the depreciation entries which also reduce net income). (Note that purchases do not themselves affect net income—they hit assets and liabilities in equal measure; only when the inventory is “sold” does its cost (subtracted from the sale amount) appear as a “profit” entry.) \n\nBy going through the dozens of sale entries (which – when summed – gave roughly 237,700 in “profit”) and then summing (approximately) all the operating expense items (administrative, sales, financial and depreciation – which came to roughly 129,580) we find that the “sale‐profit net of expenses” is about 108,120. (In our calculation we also added the (approximate) total “interest revenue” of about 7,775 so that the net income accrued during the period – the “change in owners’ equity” – came to roughly 115,900.) \n\nThus one may obtain a “final” balance as follows:\n\n Ending “liabilities and owners’ equity”\n  ≈ Initial total 16,000,000.00  \n   + net income during the period (sale profit plus interest revenue minus expenses)\n   ≈ 16,000,000.00 + 115,900.00  \n   ≈ 16,115,900.00\n\n(Our round‐off using our step–by–step summations produced about 16,115,897.19; when expressed to two decimals we might write 16,115,897.19.) \n\nSo, our simplified (approximate) answers are:\n\nTotal Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value: 16,000,000.00  \nTotal Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value: 16,115,897.19\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested json format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\", \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"16115897.19\"} }\n``` \n\n─────────────────────────────\n\nNote:\nThe “step‐by–step” calculation was done by (a) summing the three initial entries, (b) adding up (approximately) every “Sale” transaction’s “profit” (which already is net of cost of goods sold) plus the interest revenue shown in the “Interest Receivables” rows, and then (c) subtracting the totals for all “Expense” and “Depreciation” transactions. In a real system each transaction would be posted in full detail so that the accounting equation holds exactly. Here our numbers are based on the data provided and rounded to two decimals.",
