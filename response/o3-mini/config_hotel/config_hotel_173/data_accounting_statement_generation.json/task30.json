                        "content": "We must “build up” the income‐statement’s “expenses” by summing (the “recorded_amount” values) only for those transaction rows that represent an expense cost – that is, rows whose “type” is one of the expense items (for example, Administrative Expenses, Sales Expenses, Financial Expenses, Depreciation, etc). (Other transaction types such as purchases, sales, fixed‐asset entries, interest receivables, etc. do not “count” as expense entries in the income statement.)\n\nBelow is one way to work through the process.\n\nStep 1. Look at each row from the table and “select” only those with a type beginning with “Expense” or that are “Depreciation”. (For example, the row with id Expense20240101001 is an “Administrative Expenses” entry; the row with id Depreciation20240101001 is a depreciation–expense; and so on.)  \n \nStep 2. For each “expense” row, note its “recorded_amount”. For example, in our data the first expense row is:\n • Expense20240101001 – Administrative Expenses with 615.36  \nThen the depreciation row (Depreciation20240101001) has amount approximately 45,741.99, etc.\n\nStep 3. Adding up (the “recorded_amount” values of) each of these expense–type rows – including all “Expense…” rows and the “Depreciation…” rows – one finds that the sum totals (by our careful grouping and summing) 129579.16.\n\nFor clarity, here is a (shortened) “check list” of those items and their amounts that we add:\n\n • Administrative Expenses 615.36  \n • Depreciation 45741.99  \n • Sales Expenses 818.23  \n • Sales Expenses 476.79  \n • Sales Expenses 744.35  \n • Administrative Expenses 477.24  \n • Administrative Expenses 301.69  \n • Financial Expenses 341.86  \n • Sales Expenses 733.63  \n • Administrative Expenses 895.72  \n • Financial Expenses 160.75  \n • Administrative Expenses 939.72  \n • Administrative Expenses 770.84  \n • Sales Expenses 733.73  \n • Administrative Expenses 276.95  \n • Administrative Expenses 766.66  \n • Sales Expenses 351.34  \n • Sales Expenses 909.56  \n • Administrative Expenses 856.94  \n • Administrative Expenses 304.95  \n • Sales Expenses 527.30  \n • Sales Expenses 944.59  \n • Administrative Expenses 651.86  \n • Sales Expenses 661.76  \n • Administrative Expenses 611.42  \n • Sales Expenses 962.21  \n • Sales Expenses 784.06  \n • Administrative Expenses 742.42  \n • Administrative Expenses 821.12  \n • Financial Expenses 752.32  \n • Administrative Expenses 925.82  \n • Sales Expenses 202.16  \n • Sales Expenses 358.91  \n • Sales Expenses 720.70  \n • Administrative Expenses 484.40  \n • Administrative Expenses 845.07  \n • Administrative Expenses 455.40  \n • Sales Expenses 444.79  \n • Sales Expenses 898.56  \n • Sales Expenses 112.95  \n • Administrative Expenses 715.18  \n • Financial Expenses 603.61  \n • Sales Expenses 831.34  \n • Sales Expenses 990.77  \n • Administrative Expenses 788.26  \n • Sales Expenses 753.93  \n • Administrative Expenses 418.63  \n • Administrative Expenses 739.88  \n • Administrative Expenses 269.03  \n • Depreciation 50737.35  \n • Financial Expenses 724.84  \n • Administrative Expenses 885.97  \n • Administrative Expenses 109.32  \n • Administrative Expenses 884.93  \n\nWhen these numbers are summed the final total “expenses” equal 129579.16.\n\nThus the final “Total Expenses” number on the income statement is 129579.16.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Expenses': '129579.16'} }",
