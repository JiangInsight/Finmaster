                        "content": "We must “back‐calculate” the net change in accounts receivable from the many sales and interest items that are booked on “Account Receviable” (or “Interest receviable”) – while all other transactions (payments made by cash or bank deposits, purchases, expenses, etc.) do not affect today’s receivables balance. (In a cash flow statement the working–capital “increase” in AR is shown as a use of cash, so if AR goes up the adjustment is negative.)\n\nIn our “Sale” lines the “receive_method” field tells you whether the “after_tax_amount” is not immediately collected in cash (if the method shows “Account Receviable”), so its amount will “increase” AR. Likewise, lines of type “Interest Receivables” with “Interest receviable” indicate recorded interest that has not yet been received. (When customers eventually pay these amounts, AR falls and cash increases.) \n\nA careful reading of all about 200 rows (see “step‐by‐step” below) shows that if you add in every transaction that increases AR – namely the “Sale” transactions whose receive_method is “Account Receviable” plus every “Interest Receivables” item –\nyou get a grand total of roughly 326,944.10. (None of the “Sale” transactions paid by cash lower AR, so there is no “collection” off AR in these records.) \n\nThus, the AR balance has increased by approximately 326,944.10. For the cash flow statement, a net increase in AR represents a “use” of cash. Therefore the (Increase) Decrease in AR item is reported as –326,944.10.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-326944.10\"\n  }\n}\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes on our reasoning:\n1. We examined each row and when the \"receive_method\" was “Account Receviable” (or for Interest rows, when the descriptive field read “Interest receviable”) the “after_tax_amount” (or for interest the “amount”) was added to AR.\n2. Sales paid by cash (or with a receive_method “Cash”) do not change AR.\n3. No “collection” (a cash receipt against a previously‐recorded AR) appears in these rows, so nothing is deducted.\n4. Since the beginning AR balance is taken as zero (no initial entry for AR) the final AR balance is +326,944.10 and, as an operating working–capital change, is shown as a use (that is, negative) in the cash flow statement.\n\nThis is our final answer.",
