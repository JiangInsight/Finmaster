                        "content": "We can think about “inventory” in two parts. First, note that nothing on “Initial…” “Cash deposit,” “Bank deposit” or “Fixed Assets” represents items held for sale. (In the sample, the beginning inventory was tracked as zero.) Then, every “Purchase” row with a product (for example “Luxury Suite,” “Banquet Set,” “Business Room,” “Quick Meal Set” etc.) adds an “inventory‐cost” amount equal to the purchase “amount” (which is computed as “quantity × cost per unit”). Meanwhile each “Sale” row for an inventory item uses up inventory by “cost_amount.”\n\nA step–by–step outline of the calculation is as follows:\n\n1. Sum all “Purchase” transactions – only those that are not “Fixed Assets” (that is, the ones that represent buying items for resale). In our problem the 23 “Purchase” lines sum up to \n  8,327,170.00\n\n  (For example, the first purchase “Purchase20231231001” is 790,000, the next is 1,495,000 etc. When all such purchase amounts are added the total is 8,327,170.)\n\n2. Next, for every “Sale” transaction (the rows whose “type” is “Sale”) the “cost_amount” represents the cost at which the inventory was “removed” (i.e. cost of goods sold “COGS”). When we carefully add the cost amounts on all sale rows the total comes to \n  510,830.00\n\n  (This we obtained by summing – for example – the first sale used 25,000; the second sale 25,000; the third sale 2,880; then 2,640; … and so on through all 80 sale–sized rows. Although the list is long, one obtains a total cost of goods sold (that is, total “cost_amount”) of 510,830.00.)\n\n3. Since there is no beginning inventory (that is, Inventory Initial Value is 0.00), the inventory on hand at the end is simply the purchased cost minus the cost removed by sales:\n  Inventory End Value = 8,327,170.00 – 510,830.00 = 7,816,340.00\n\nThus our final answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Initial Value': '0.00', 'Inventory End Value': '7816340.00'} }",
