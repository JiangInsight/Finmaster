                        "content": "We will calculate the three ratios step‐by‐step.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nThis ratio is defined as:\n  Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Net Profit)\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –2,419,019.09  \nand from the income statement:\n  Net Profit = 146,127.58\n\nThus,\n  Ratio = –2,419,019.09 / 146,127.58 ≈ –16.56\n\n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\nA common approach is to divide total revenue by the ending current assets. From the income statement, the Total Revenue is 863,371.65 and from the balance sheet the ending total current assets are 13,753,616.13. Therefore:\n  Ratio = 863,371.65 / 13,753,616.13 ≈ 0.0628  \nRounded to two decimals, this is approximately 0.06.\n\n3. Quick Ratio\n\nThe Quick Ratio is calculated as:\n  Quick Ratio = (Current Assets – Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n  Ending Current Assets = 13,753,616.13  \n  Ending Inventory = 7,832,820.00  \n  Ending Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n\nFirst, compute the “quick assets”:\n  Quick Assets = 13,753,616.13 – 7,832,820.00 = 5,920,796.13\n\nThen,\n  Quick Ratio = 5,920,796.13 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ 1.07\n\nThus, the three ratios are:\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: –16.56  \nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio: 0.06  \nQuick Ratio: 1.07\n\nThe final answer in the requested JSON format is provided below.\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-16.56\", \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.06\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.07\"}}",
