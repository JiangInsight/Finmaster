In our case, the following end‐of‐period amounts are considered quick assets:\n • Cash on Hand: 2,882,590.91  \n • Bank Deposits: 2,698,390.00  \n • Interest Receivable: 9,066.78  \n • Accounts Receivable: 330,748.44  \n\nStep 1. Sum the quick assets:  \n 2,882,590.91 + 2,698,390.00 = 5,580,980.91  \n 5,580,980.91 + 9,066.78 = 5,590,047.69  \n 5,590,047.69 + 330,748.44 = 5,920,796.13  \n\nStep 2. The total current liabilities at the end amount are given as 5,515,978.61.\n\nStep 3. Calculate the Quick Ratio:  \n Quick Ratio = (Quick Assets) / (Current Liabilities)  \n = 5,920,796.13 / 5,515,978.61  \n ≈ 1.0734\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the Quick Ratio is approximately 1.07.\n\nThus, the solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '1.07'}}",
