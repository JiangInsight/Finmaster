                        "content": "We begin by determining the averages and then the ratios step‐by‐step.\n\n1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n• Use the formula:  \n  Accounts Receivable Turnover = Main Business Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n• Main Business Revenue from the income statement = 863371.65  \n• Accounts Receivable on the balance sheet:  \n  Initial = 0.00, End = 330748.44  \n  Average Accounts Receivable = (0.00 + 330748.44) / 2 = 165374.22  \n• Thus, the ratio = 863371.65 / 165374.22 ≈ 5.22\n\n2. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio (and Operating Cash Flow Ratio)  \n• From the cash flow statement, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –2419019.09  \n• Total Current Liabilities from the balance sheet (End amount) = 5515978.61  \n• Ratio = –2419019.09 / 5515978.61 ≈ –0.44  \n• Note: As in the previous example the “operating cash flow ratio” was taken as the same calculation as “operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio.”\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n• Use the formula:  \n  Total Asset Turnover = Total Revenue / Average Total Assets  \n• Total Revenue = 863371.65  \n• Total Assets:  \n  Initial Total Assets = 16000000.00  \n  End Total Assets = 21662106.19  \n  Average Total Assets = (16000000.00 + 21662106.19) / 2 ≈ 18831053.095  \n• Thus, the ratio = 863371.65 / 18831053.095 ≈ 0.0459, which rounds to 0.05\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n• Debt typically refers to total liabilities. Since only current liabilities are provided, we assume that the liability figure is given by:  \n  Total Liabilities = Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity – Total Owner's Equity  \n  = 21662106.19 – 16146127.58 = 5515978.61  \n• Total Owner's Equity (End) = 16146127.58  \n• Therefore, Debt to Equity = 5515978.61 / 16146127.58 ≈ 0.3416, which rounds to 0.34\n\nNow, presenting our answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"5.22\", \n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-0.44\", \n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.44\", \n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.05\", \n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.34\"\n  }\n}",
