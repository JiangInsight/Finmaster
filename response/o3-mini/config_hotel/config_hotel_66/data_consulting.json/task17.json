The values are:\n  Accounts Payable = 5,472,810.00  \n  Taxes Payable = 43,168.61  \n  Total Debt = 5,472,810.00 + 43,168.61 = 5,515,978.61\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio.\nThe formula is:  \n  Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt\n\nPlug in the values:  \n  Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = –2,419,019.09 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ –0.4385\n\nStep 3: Round the value\nRounded to two decimal places, the ratio is –0.44.\n\nThus, the solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.44\"\n  }\n}",
