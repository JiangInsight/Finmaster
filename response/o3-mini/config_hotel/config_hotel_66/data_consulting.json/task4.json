The total current liabilities provided are 5,515,978.61.\n\n• Total Owner's Equity is given as 16,146,127.58.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Debt-to-Equity Ratio using the formula:\n\n  Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n\nSubstitute the numbers:\n\n  Debt-to-Equity Ratio = 5,515,978.61 / 16,146,127.58 ≈ 0.3413\n\nRounded to two decimal places, this is approximately 0.34.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.34'} }",
