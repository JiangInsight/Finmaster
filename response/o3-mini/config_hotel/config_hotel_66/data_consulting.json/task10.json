From the Cash Flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is –2,419,019.09.\n\nStep 2. From the Balance Sheet, the Total Current Liabilities is 5,515,978.61.\n\nStep 3. Now, compute the ratio:\n  Ratio = (–2,419,019.09) / (5,515,978.61) ≈ –0.4385\n\nFor reporting, we can round this to –0.44.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.44'}}",
