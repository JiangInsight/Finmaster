                        "content": "We first extract the necessary data from the provided statements (all amounts refer to the “end” values):\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow (OCF): –2,419,019.09  \n2. Total Current Liabilities: 5,515,978.61  \n3. Inventory (end): 7,832,820.00  \n4. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): 562,950.00  \n5. Owner’s Equity (end): 16,146,127.58\n\nAdditional current asset items (end amounts) are:\n• Cash on Hand: 2,882,590.91  \n• Bank Deposits: 2,698,390.00  \n• Interest Receivable: 9,066.78  \n• Accounts Receivable: 330,748.44\n\nThe “Total Current Assets” is given as 13,753,616.13. (One can also verify that the sum of the five lines equals this total.)\n\nBelow we show step‐by‐step calculations.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n Formula:  OCF Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Current Liabilities  \n Calculation:  –2,419,019.09 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ –0.439  \n Rounded (2 decimals): –0.44\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \nOften this is defined as Operating Cash Flow divided by Total Debt. (Here “debt” is taken as current liabilities since they are the only liabilities provided.)  \n Formula:  Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Current Liabilities  \n Calculation:  –2,419,019.09 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ –0.439  \n Rounded (2 decimals): –0.44\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio  \nUsually computed as:  \n Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  \nSince initial inventory is 0, the average inventory is (0 + Ending Inventory) / 2.  \n Average Inventory = (0 + 7,832,820.00) / 2 = 3,916,410.00  \n Inventory Turnover = 562,950.00 / 3,916,410.00 ≈ 0.1438  \nRounded (2 decimals): 0.14\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \nUsing current liabilities for “Debt”:  \n Debt to Equity = Total Current Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity  \n Calculation:  5,515,978.61 / 16,146,127.58 ≈ 0.3414  \nRounded (2 decimals): 0.34\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 5. Quick Ratio  \nQuick assets are those current assets that can be quickly converted into cash. They are usually defined as:  \n Quick Assets = (Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable)  \nSum these up:  \n = 2,882,590.91 + 2,698,390.00 + 330,748.44 + 9,066.78 = 2,882,590.91 + 2,698,390.00 = 5,580,980.91  \n Then, 5,580,980.91 + 330,748.44 = 5,911,729.35  \n Finally, 5,911,729.35 + 9,066.78 = 5,920,796.13  \nNow,  \n Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \n = 5,920,796.13 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ 1.0732  \nRounded (2 decimals): 1.07\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 6. Current Ratio  \n Formula: Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \n Calculation:  13,753,616.13 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ 2.494  \nRounded (2 decimals): 2.49\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThus, the final ratios are:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.44', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.44', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.14', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.34', 'Quick Ratio': '1.07', 'Current Ratio': '2.49'}}",
