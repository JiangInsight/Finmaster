                        "content": "We first compute the two ratios step by step.\n\n1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\nDebt is represented by the total liabilities. From the balance sheet, Total Liabilities is calculated as:\n  Total Liabilities = Total Assets – Total Owner’s Equity  \n   = 21662106.19 – 16146127.58  \n   = 5515978.61\n\nThen, the Debt to Asset Ratio is:\n  Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets  \n   = 5515978.61 / 21662106.19  \n   ≈ 0.2546  \nRounded, this gives approximately 0.25.\n\n2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –2419019.09  \n\nAnd from the income statement:\n  Net Profit = 146127.58  \n\nThus, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is:\n  Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit  \n   = –2419019.09 / 146127.58  \n   ≈ –16.55\n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.25\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-16.55\"\n  }\n}",
