Current Assets = 13,753,616.13  \n   Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61  \n\n• Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \n  = 13,753,616.13 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ 2.49  \n\n2. Inventory = 7,832,820.00  \n Quick Assets = Current Assets – Inventory  \n  = 13,753,616.13 – 7,832,820.00  \n  = 5,920,796.13  \n• Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities  \n  = 5,920,796.13 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ 1.07  \n\n3.

From the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -2,419,019.09  \n For Debt here we use the total liabilities  \n• Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Liabilities  \n  = -2,419,019.09 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ -0.44  \n\nThus, the final solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '2.49', 'Quick Ratio': '1.07', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.25', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.34', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.44'}}",
