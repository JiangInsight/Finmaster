                        "content": "We start by gathering the numbers from each of the statements (all ending figures are from 2024‑02‑01):\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio \n • Operating Cash Flow (from the cash flow statement) = –2,419,019.09  \n • Total Current Liabilities (from the balance sheet) = 5,515,978.61  \n  Ratio = –2,419,019.09 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ –0.44\n\n2. Debt to Equity Ratio \n • Total Liabilities: In this balance sheet the only liabilities shown are current liabilities = 5,515,978.61  \n • Total Owner's Equity (end) = 16,146,127.58  \n  Ratio = 5,515,978.61 / 16,146,127.58 ≈ 0.34\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio \n • Total Revenue (from the income statement) = 863,371.65  \n • Total Assets (end) = 21,662,106.19  \n  Ratio = 863,371.65 / 21,662,106.19 ≈ 0.04\n\n4. Quick Ratio \n Quick assets include Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, and Accounts Receivable.  \n • Cash on Hand: 2,882,590.91  \n • Bank Deposits: 2,698,390.00  \n • Interest Receivable: 9,066.78  \n • Accounts Receivable: 330,748.44  \n  Sum of Quick Assets = 2,882,590.91 + 2,698,390.00 + 9,066.78 + 330,748.44 = 5,920,796.13  \n Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61  \n  Quick Ratio = 5,920,796.13 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ 1.07\n\n5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio \n This is the same calculation as in step (1):  \n  Ratio = –2,419,019.09 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ –0.44\n\n6. Return on Equity (ROE) \n We use the average owner’s equity.  \n • Beginning Owner’s Equity = 16,000,000.00  \n • Ending Owner’s Equity = 16,146,127.58  \n  Average Owner’s Equity = (16,000,000.00 + 16,146,127.58) / 2 = 16,073,063.79  \n Net Profit (from the income statement) = 146,127.58  \n  ROE = 146,127.58 / 16,073,063.79 ≈ 0.0091, or 0.91%\n\n7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio \n We assume that all sales are on credit. The average accounts receivable is used.  \n • Beginning Accounts Receivable = 0.00  \n • Ending Accounts Receivable = 330,748.44  \n  Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 330,748.44) / 2 = 165,374.22  \n Total Revenue = 863,371.65  \n  Ratio = 863,371.65 / 165,374.22 ≈ 5.22\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.44\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.34\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.04\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.07\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.44\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"0.91%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"5.22\"\n  }\n}",
