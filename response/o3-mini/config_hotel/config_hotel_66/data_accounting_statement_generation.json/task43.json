                        "content": "We must “simulate” an operating‐activities cash flow calculation by “sifting” the transaction records for real cash inflows and outflows that happen in day‐to‐day operations. (In our data, we assume that only “paid” receipt/payment transactions in sale, expense and purchase “types” count; non‐cash items such as depreciation and non‑paid items (or “unpaid” transactions) are not included. Also, “initial” deposits and “fixed asset” purchases are not part of operations.) \n\nBelow is one sample “step‐by‐step” approach:\n\n1. For purchases (– “Purchase” type) we include only those rows whose payment/receipt status is “Paid” (because if unpaid no cash leaves). For example, one “Purchase20231231001” for 371,520.0 (paid) is subtracted, while another “Purchase20231231002” (829,440.0 but unpaid) is ignored.\n\n2. Similarly, expense items (e.g. Administrative Expenses, Sales Expenses, Financial Expenses) appear only when “Paid” and are subtracted.\n\n3. For sales we include only “Sale” records that are “Paid” (and so actually receive cash). (Unpaid sales – for instance those recorded as “Account Receivable” – are not added.) \n\n4. Finally, noncash items such as “Depreciation” or “Interest Receivables” with “Unpaid” status are ignored.\n\nBy going down each record we sum (a) all “cash inflows” from sales that are paid and (b) all “cash outflows” (purchases that were paid plus expenses that were paid). (The sample process below shows how one may manually “aggregate” hundreds of records.)\n\nFor the present data the summed paid cash receipts (from the “Sale” rows with status “Paid”) come to about 532,623.21, while the sum of all operating outlays (from “Purchase” – only when paid – and “Expense” rows that are paid) comes to about 2,623,642.30. \n\nTherefore, the net cash flow from operating activities is calculated as\n\n  Net operating cash flow = 532,623.21 – 2,623,642.30 = –2,091,019.09\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities': '-2091019.09'} }",
