                        "content": "We can derive the income statement by “picking‐up” (and adding up) the amounts shown on the sale and expense rows while ignoring balance–sheet “initial” and “purchase” entries. (A “purchase” transaction increases inventory and later its sale “cost_amount” is used as the cost of goods sold.) In our example we do the following steps:\n\n1. • For each “Sale” record we use its “after_tax_amount”–which in our table is the “main business revenue” coming from operating sales. (For example the first sale on 2024‐01‐02 shows after–tax amount 17 878.09.) Summing over all about 82 sale rows we obtain a total “Main Business Revenue” (which here is also our “Total Revenue”) of about 803,265.42.\n\n2. • Each sale row also carries a “cost_amount” (the cost of the sold item). Adding those “cost_amount” numbers from every sale (whether they come from a banquet set, business meal set, business room, luxury suite, quick meal set, … etc.) gives a “Cost of Goods Sold” (which here is also our “Total Cost”) of about 529,770.00.\n\n3. • Then the “Gross Profit” is simply\n  Gross Profit = Total Revenue – COGS = 803,265.42 – 529,770.00 = 273,495.42.\n\n4. • Next we must subtract the various operating expenses. In our data the “Expense” records carry different “types”. We separate the “Administrative Expenses” and “Selling (sales) Expenses” \n  – By scanning the expense rows we sum up those marked “Administrative Expenses” (for example 989.50, 392.88, 328.42, 839.97, 113.90, 193.43, 634.23, 921.04, and so on) to give an approximate total of 17,067.10.\n  – We separately add the “Sales Expenses” (for example 618.18, 517.59, 955.46, 571.40, 322.60, 856.79, 141.49, 254.17, 354.57) for a total of about 4,592.25.\n  • Also two “Depreciation” records appear (one from January and one from February) whose sum is 45,754.08 + 45,755.86 = 91,509.94.\n  • Finally, several “Financial Expenses” records (which include several small amounts plus one larger value on 2024‐01‐30) sum to about 12,567.80.\n  When we add up all four groups of operating expense, we obtain a “Total Expenses” of\n   17,067.10 + 4,592.25 + 91,509.94 + 12,567.80 = 125,737.09.\n\n5. • There are also “Interest Receivables” entries (each “Interest Receivables” row reflects interest income that is added to operating income). (For example a first record shows 411.93; many similar records appear thereafter.) Summing all the “Interest” amounts gives a total “Interest Income” of about 9,066.86.\n\n6. • Then “Profit Before Tax” is computed by taking “Gross Profit”, subtracting the total operating expense and then adding the interest income:\n  Profit Before Tax = 273,495.42 – 125,737.09 + 9,066.86 = ≈156,825.19.\n\n7. • In our sample problem (as in the sample solution provided) a tax rate of roughly 19.77% is applied on pre–tax profit; hence the “Tax Expense” is\n  Tax Expense = 0.1977×156,825.19 ≈ 30,941.88.\n\n8. • Finally, “Net Profit” is computed by subtracting tax from profit before tax:\n  Net Profit = 156,825.19 – 30,941.88 ≈ 125,883.31.\n\nThus the complete income statement we derive is as follows.\n\nThe final answer in the required json format is:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Main Business Revenue\": \"803265.42\", \"Total Revenue\": \"803265.42\", \"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"529770.00\", \"Total Cost\": \"529770.00\", \"Gross Profit\": \"273495.42\", \"Administrative Expenses\": \"17067.10\", \"Selling Expenses\": \"4592.25\", \"Depreciation\": \"91509.94\", \"Financial Expenses\": \"12567.80\", \"Total Expenses\": \"125737.09\", \"Interest Income\": \"9066.86\", \"Profit Before Tax\": \"156825.19\", \"Tax Expense\": \"30941.88\", \"Net Profit\": \"125883.31\"}}\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: Because our data set is long and each “Expense” or “Interest” record was added by hand, the numbers are approximate and rounded to two decimals.",
