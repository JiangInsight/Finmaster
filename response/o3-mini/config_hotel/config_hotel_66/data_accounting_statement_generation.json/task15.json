                        "content": "We must “read” the full list of transactions and “pick‐out” only those entries that add obligations – that is, amounts that are “unpaid” when the purchase is recorded and paid via “Account Payable” (for example). (The “initial” transactions are funds that come in as asset injections; none of them are “liabilities”.) Then the “final liabilities” amount is computed as the sum of all “Purchase” entries that were left “Unpaid.”\n\nLet’s explain briefly (note that in a real implementation you would sum automatically):\n\n• Among the “Initial…” rows no liability is created so the beginning “Liabilities” is zero.\n\n• In the “Purchase” transactions we review only those whose “payment/receipt_status” is “Unpaid.” In our new problem the unpaid purchase rows are (with their “amount” values):\n\n  – Purchase20231231002: 829,440.00  \n  – Purchase20231231004: 1,250,000.00  \n  – Purchase20231231005: 246,000.00  \n  – Purchase20231231007: 140,800.00  \n  – Purchase20231231008: 254,320.00  \n  – Purchase20231231011: 540,000.00  \n  – Purchase20231231013: 585,000.00  \n  – Purchase20231231014: 755,000.00  \n  – Purchase20231231015: 59,850.00  \n  – Purchase20231231019: 32,850.00  \n  – Purchase20231231022: 19,050.00  \n  – Purchase20231231023: 358,500.00  \n  – Purchase20231231024: 402,000.00\n\nWhen we add these together (step‐by‐step):\n\n 829,440  \n+1,250,000 = 2,079,440  \n+246,000 = 2,325,440  \n+140,800 = 2,466,240  \n+254,320 = 2,720,560  \n+540,000 = 3,260,560  \n+585,000 = 3,845,560  \n+755,000 = 4,600,560  \n+59,850 = 4,660,410  \n+32,850 = 4,693,260  \n+19,050 = 4,712,310  \n+358,500 = 5,070,810  \n+402,000 = 5,472,810\n\nThus, the “end‐of–period liabilities” total 5,472,810.00.\n\nSo our final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"5472810.00\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote: In actual practice one must carefully check which rows create an “obligation” (i.e. unpaid purchases recorded with an “Account Payable” method) whereas other items (such as expenditures, depreciation, or interest receivables) do not create liabilities.",
