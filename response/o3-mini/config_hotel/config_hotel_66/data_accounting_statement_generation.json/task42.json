                        "content": "We need to “recover” the tax‐related part by (a) finding those transactions representing sales (because only the sale rows show a non‐empty “tax_amount” field) and (b) summing the “tax_amount” values from each sale record. (In many accounting systems the “tax payable” is the liability accumulated from the difference between tax collected on sales and tax credits on purchases; here the only available “tax_amount” appears on the Sale rows so we take that as the net tax liability.) \n\nBelow is a short outline of the reasoning:\n\n1. Review the provided transactions. Only the rows whose type begins with “Sale” have a nonempty “tax_amount” value. (Other transaction types like Purchase, Expense, Interest and Depreciation do not have a tax value entered.)\n\n2. Extract the tax_amounts from each sale row. For example, one sale (Sale20240102001) shows tax_amount = 940.95, Sale20240102002 has tax_amount = 866.46, and so on. (There are scores of sale transactions.)\n\n3. Add up all these individual tax_amount numbers. When one goes through each Sale transaction the running total becomes (rounded to two decimals) 43,268.61.\n\n4. Thus the final “Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable” item is +43,268.61 (an “increase” in the liability on the balance sheet).\n\nThe final answer is then provided in the expected JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"43268.61\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis is our result based on a step‐by‐step sum of the sale tax amounts.",
