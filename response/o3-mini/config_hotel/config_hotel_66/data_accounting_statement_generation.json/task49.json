We started with initial cash deposits of 3,000,000 (cash) and 5,000,000 (bank) giving an 8,000,000‐beginning balance.\n2. The “Net Profit” was taken as the sum of the sales’ profit fields (≈308,459.88).\n3. Noncash depreciation expense totaled about 91,509.94.\n4. Working–capital adjustments were estimated from the unsatisfied sales (accounts receivable up ≈313,780.32), additional interest receivables (≈7,953.70) and an estimated inventory buildup (≈1,895,770.00), offset by the purchase side’s effect on accounts payable (an increase of ≈5,472,810.00). No tax–payable change was assumed.\n5. Combining these adjustments with net profit plus depreciation yields an operating cash flow of roughly +3,655,275.80.\n6. No new fixed–asset purchases occurred during the period (so investing cash flow is nil).\n7. Adding the net operating inflow to the beginning cash of 8,000,000 gives an ending cash balance of about 11,655,275.80; the net increase is the operating flow of +3,655,275.80.\n\nNote that because many details (for example, the estimation of inventory change and the working capital components) must be inferred from the raw transactions, the above numbers are one acceptable set of rounded estimates for a complete cash flow statement based on the provided data.\n",
