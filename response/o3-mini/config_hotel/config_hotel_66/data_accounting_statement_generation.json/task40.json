                        "content": "We first must “re‐build” the inventory balance from the transactions. In our case the only inventory–related transactions are those that add items through purchases and those that “remove” items when they are sold (using the “cost_amount” reported on each sale).\n\nStep 1. (Total Purchases)\n• Every “Purchase” row has an “amount” equal to (quantity × cost per unit). (For example, the first purchase has 129 items at 2880 each giving 129×2880 = 371520.) \n• Adding up every purchase row (see below) we obtain a total purchase “investment” of \n\n  371520.0 + 829440.0 + 35000.0 + 1250000.0 + 246000.0 + 582000.0 + 140800.0 + 254320.0 + 240240.0 + 216000.0 + 540000.0 + 177000.0 + 585000.0 + 755000.0 + 59850.0 + 820800.0 + 80500.0 + 328000.0 + 32850.0 + 36050.0 + 35850.0 + 358500.0 + 402000.0 = 8,369,720.0\n\nStep 2. (Cost of Goods Sold via Sales)\n• Each “Sale” row reports a “cost_amount” that represents the cost (that is, the inventory “outflow”) for the sold inventory.\n• For example, the very first sale of “Banquet Set” has cost_amount = 11520.0.\n• Adding together all the “Sale” rows’ cost_amount values we get a total cost of goods sold (COGS) of 542,150.0 (summing over all 80–plus sale transactions).\n\nStep 3. (Net Change in Inventory)\nWhen there is no beginning inventory (or when it is zero) the ending inventory is the sum of purchases minus the cost of goods sold:\n  Ending Inventory = Purchases – Cost of Goods Sold\n  = 8,369,720.0 – 542,150.0 \n  = 7,827,570.0\n\nBecause inventory increased (it is “left on hand”), the cash flow statement will show an increase in the inventory account of 7,827,570.00. (Remember that, in a cash flow statement, an increase in inventory is “subtracted” from operating cash flow; however, here we are reporting the raw change.)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"7827570.00\"}}",
