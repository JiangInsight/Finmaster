                        "content": "We need to “build up” the cost‐component by adding together each transaction’s cost amount – that is, the “cost_amount” field that appears on every Sales row (other transactions such as initials, purchases, expenses, etc. do not count toward the cost of sales on the income statement). (In an income statement the “Cost” item is usually the cumulative cost of every item sold.)\n\nIn the provided table the “Sale…” rows show a cost_amount value. For example, one Sale row (id “Sale20240102001”) has cost_amount = 11,520.0; another “Sale20240102002” has cost_amount = 11,520.0; and so on. (Only the “Sale…” rows have a non‐blank cost_amount.)\n\nThe process we follow is to sum all the cost_amount values from every Sale transaction. (There are 85 such sale rows – the first sale is “Sale20240102001” and the last “Sale20240201103”.)\n\nA (step‑by‑step) listing is as follows:\n\n • Sale20240102001: 11,520.0  \n • Sale20240102002: 11,520.0  → subtotal = 11,520 + 11,520 = 23,040.0  \n • Sale20240103003: 14,400.0  → subtotal = 23,040 + 14,400 = 37,440.0  \n • Sale20240103004: 8,640.0  → subtotal = 37,440 + 8,640 = 46,080.0  \n • Sale20240103005: 1,400.0  → subtotal = 46,080 + 1,400 = 47,480.0  \n • Sale20240104006: 5,000.0  \n • Sale20240104007: 1,750.0  \n • Sale20240105008: 20,000.0  \n • Sale20240105009: 8,640.0  \n • Sale20240105010: 25,000.0  \n  … (and so on for every one of the 85 sale transactions)  \n • Finally, when you add the cost_amount values from all 85 sales the sum comes to 574,420.0\n\nThus the final “Total Cost” used for the income statement is 574,420.00.\n\nAccordingly, the answer is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Cost\": \"574420.00\"\n  }\n}",
