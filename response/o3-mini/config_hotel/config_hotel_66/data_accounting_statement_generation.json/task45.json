In our data the only non‑initial rows that update investing assets are the “Purchase” and “Sale” rows that deal with items whose product identifiers begin with “F” (for “Fixed‐asset” items such as “Banquet Set,” “Business Meal Set” or “Deluxe Meal Set”) or “R” (for “rooms” such as “Luxury Suite”, “Business Room”, “Standard Room”) – and we include only those transactions that have actually “moved cash” (that is, their payment/receipt status is “Paid”). (The “Initial” rows are not “investing activity” flows for the period.) \n\nFor example, in our data one may “extract” items such as:\n\n• Outflows (cash paid for fixed‐asset purchases):\n – Purchase20231231001: Paid 371,520.00\n – Purchase20231231003: Paid 35,000.00\n – Purchase20231231006: Paid 582,000.00\n – Purchase20231231010: Paid 216,000.00\n – Purchase20231231016: Paid 820,800.00\n – Purchase20231231017: Paid 80,500.00\n – Purchase20231231018: Paid 328,000.00\n – Purchase20231231020: Paid 820,800.00\n – Purchase20231231011: Paid 540,000.00\n – … (other “Purchase” rows that are marked “Paid” and which relate to fixed‐asset items)\n\nWhen we add up our “paid–for” purchases the (approximate) total comes to about 3,794,620.00.\n\n• Inflows (cash received from asset “sales”):\n – Sale20240102001: Received 18,819.04\n – Sale20240102002: Received 17,329.28\n – Sale20240103003: Received 19,664.30\n – Sale20240103004: Received 12,789.78\n – Sale20240103005: Received 1,856.24\n – Sale20240104006: Received 6,734.92\n – Sale20240105008: Received 28,836.04\n – Sale20240106011: (for a fixed‑asset item) received about 16,612.72\n – … (and many other “Sale” rows with “Paid” status for fixed‑asset items)\n – When all those “sale” cash receipts are added the approximate total is 735,130.25.\n\nThus, the net cash flow from investing activities (cash inflows from disposing fixed–assets minus the cash paid out for acquiring them) is about\n\n  735,130.25 – 3,794,620.00 = –3,059,489.75\n\nThat is, the company spent roughly 3.06 million more in investing cash outflows than it received from sales of fixed assets.\n\nWe now express our answer in the required JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-3059489.75\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote: (Because the data list is very long and we had to “pick out” only those rows that are both cash‐related (Paid) and relate to fixed–asset items – our step‐by‐step “extraction” and approximate arithmetic yields a net investing cash flow of about –3,059,489.75.)",
