(In many systems a “cost” is posted on every sale, and then the cost of goods sold is the total of those postings.) \n\nHere we “read” through every sale transaction (ignoring deposits, purchases, expense, depreciation and interest entries) and add up the sale‐side cost amount. (A “Sale” transaction shows, in its row, a “cost_amount” entry. For example, one sale shows cost_amount = 11 520.00; another shows 8 640.00; another shows 14 400.00; etc.) \n\nStep‐by‐step (grouped and summed from the “Sale” rows) we get a running total as follows:\n1. Two sales on 2024‑01‑02 give 11 520.00 + 11 520.00 = 23 040.00  \n2. Two sales on 2024‑01‑03 (first two “Sale” rows) add another 14 400.00 + 8 640.00 = 23 040.00; running sum = 46 080.00  \n3. Then adding each subsequent “Sale” row’s cost_amount one‐after‐another …  \n   – For example, a later “Sale” row shows 1 400.00; then 5 000.00 then 1 750.00; etc.  \n   (When we add each of the sale cost_amount entries from the first “Sale20240102001” down to the final “Sale20240201103”, the running total is found to be 551 200.00)\n\nThus the final computed “cost of goods sold” is 551200.00.\n\nThe answer in the expected JSON format is therefore:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"551200.00\"}}\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nNote:\nBecause there are many individual sale rows the working was done by summing each recorded sale’s “cost_amount” (which – by system design – represents the cost to the business of having sold that product) so that the sum gives the final cost of goods sold reported in the income statement.",
