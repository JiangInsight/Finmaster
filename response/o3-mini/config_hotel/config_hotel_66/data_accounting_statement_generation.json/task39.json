                        "content": "We must “adjust” the operating cash flow for the change in interest receivable. In our system the interest earned is not received in cash immediately so any increase in the interest receivable account is a “use” of funds and therefore is shown as a decrease in the cash (an “adjustment” deduction).\n\nThe approach is to go through all the transactions with type “Interest Receivables” (or with an “Interest” prefix and “Interest receviable” in the “receive_method” field) and “sum up” the reported amounts. (In effect, the ending balance of the interest receivable account equals the sum of all these transactions as no beginning‐of‐period balance is provided.)\n\nIn our “Problem to Solve” table there are 32 Interest Receivables transactions. Their amounts (in order) are approximately:\n\n  411.93  \n  408.82  \n  408.82  \n  357.02  \n  357.02  \n  335.64  \n  316.42  \n  316.42  \n  316.42  \n  316.42  \n  316.42  \n  316.42  \n  316.42  \n  243.37  \n  243.37  \n  243.37  \n  240.16  \n  240.16  \n  240.16  \n  240.16  \n  240.16  \n  240.16  \n  240.16  \n  240.16  \n  240.16  \n  240.16  \n  240.16  \n  240.16  \n  240.16  \n  240.16  \n  240.16  \n  240.16  \n\nStep–by–step we add them:\n\n• First three: 411.93 + 408.82 + 408.82 = 1229.57  \n• Add 357.02 twice: 1229.57 + 357.02 = 1586.59; then +357.02 = 1943.61  \n• +335.64 = 2279.26  \n• Then adding seven consecutive entries of about 316.42 gives after 3 more such additions (4th, 5th, 6th in the series of “316.42”) the running total reaches roughly 4494.17  \n• Next come three “243.37” entries: 4494.17 → 4737.54 → 4980.90 → 5224.27  \n• Then all the remaining 16 items are around 240.16 (one, two, …, sixteen times 240.16 = 16×240.16 = 3842.56 approximately). Adding 5224.27 + 3842.56 = 9066.83 (very nearly 9066.78 in our detailed summing).\n\nThus the ending balance (i.e. the sum of all Interest Receivables) is about 9066.78\n\nBecause the beginning balance was zero (or at least not provided) the net change is an increase of 9066.78. In a cash‐flow calculation an increase in an asset (here, interest receivable) is a “use” of cash – it is subtracted. Therefore, the cash flow adjustment for interest receivable is –9066.78.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-9066.78\"\n}\n\nPresented in the required JSON format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-9066.78\"}}\n```",
