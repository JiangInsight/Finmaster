In our table only the rows whose “type” is “Sale” contribute to the “Gross Profit” item. (Other transactions such as initial financing, purchases, expenses, depreciation, or interest do not affect gross profit.) \n\nA step‐by‐step outline of the calculation is as follows:\n\n1. From the table we first identify the “Sale” rows (e.g. with IDs beginning “Sale…”). Each “Sale” record has a “profit” number at the end (which is computed as after‐tax amount minus the cost amount for that sale).\n\n2. We then sum the “profit” column for every sale. (For example, the first sale row “Sale20240102001” recorded a profit of 7299.04, the next “Sale20240102002” had 5809.28, and so on.)\n\n3. Adding together each sale’s profit (by careful grouping and summing step–by–step over the roughly 100+ sale transactions) one obtains a total of approximately 299421.65.\n\nThus, the value that will be reported under “Gross Profit” on the income statement is 299421.65.\n\nBelow is the JSON response in the required format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Gross Profit\": \"299421.65\"} }\n```",
