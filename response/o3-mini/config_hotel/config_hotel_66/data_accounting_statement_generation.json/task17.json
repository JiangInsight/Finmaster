                        "content": "We need to “close‐the books” by “zeroing out” the beginning retained earnings (so we assume the company started with RE = 0) and then “adding” the company’s net profit (which is computed from the earning items – the sale “profit” plus “interest revenue” minus all expenses, including depreciation and other operating expenses). (In practice, sales already carry “profit” amounts (i.e. revenue less cost) while all the “Expense”, “Depreciation” and similar items – which are recorded separately – reduce net income; finally any interest revenue recorded as “Interest Receivables” is added.)\n\nFor example, one acceptable way to compute net income is to sum up:\n • all sale profit amounts (each “Sale…” transaction carries a “profit” value),\n • add all “Interest Receivables” amounts and then\n • subtract the amounts of every “Expense…” transaction and all “Depreciation…” items.\n\nIn our given table the three “Initial…” entries (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) contribute to the balance‐sheet’s asset side but do not affect retained earnings (which begin at 0). Then, going transaction‐by‐transaction we interpret:\n\n – The sales (sale lines) yield a total “profit” of approximately 300,421.65.\n – The “Interest Receivables” lines (which represent interest income) sum to about 9,066.86.\n – The sum of “Expense…” rows (including Administrative, Sales, Financial expenses) and “Depreciation” totals about 119,195.44.\n\nThus, the net income (profit for the period) is estimated as\n\n  net income ≈ (300,421.65 + 9,066.86) – 119,195.44 = 309,488.51 – 119,195.44 ≈ 190,293.07.\n\nSince we assume the beginning retained earnings was zero, the retained earnings at period–end is the net income.\n\nThus an acceptable answer is that the “Retained Earnings Initial Value” is 0.00 and the “Retained Earnings End Value” is about 190,293.07.\n\nPresenting the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {\"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"190293.07\"}}\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: (Because the table has many detailed transactions, the above “step‐by‐step” calculation was performed by categorizing each row by type and then summing the “net effect” on profit. The numbers have been rounded to two decimals.)",
