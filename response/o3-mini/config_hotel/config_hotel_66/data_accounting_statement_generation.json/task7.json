(Other initial “Cash deposit” and “Bank deposit” rows affect cash and bank balances but not fixed assets.) \n\nUnlike some situations where a separate “Fixed Assets Purchase” entry is recorded—in our example the additional fixed asset addition was shown by a “Fixed Assets Purchase” row (and was added on top of an initial fixed‐assets balance)—here no other transaction is clearly designated as a fixed asset purchase. (Many “Purchase” transactions record the purchase of items with product names such as “Banquet Set,” “Business Meal Set,” “Luxury Suite,” etc.; these are later sold in “Sale” transactions and therefore should be considered inventory rather than capital equipment.) \n\nDepreciation entries (for example, the “Depreciation20240101001” and “Depreciation20240201002” rows) do exist, but following the pattern in the earlier example solution the depreciation is not “netted” against the fixed assets item (it is usually shown as a separate contra‐asset account on the balance sheet). \n\nThus you have:\n\n• Fixed Assets Initial Value = 8,000,000.00  \n• Fixed Assets End Value = 8,000,000.00 (no additional fixed assets purchase was recorded)\n\nBased on that reasoning, the answer is provided below.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"8000000.00\"} }\n```",
