                        "content": "We “reconstruct” the current‐assets “building block” roughly as follows. In our books the “initial” current assets are taken only from the “initial” transactions for which only cash and bank deposits balance‐sheet entries are given (the “Fixed Assets” line is not current). In this problem the initial two entries are\n\n  Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00  \n  Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00  \n  –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  \n  Total initial current assets = 8,000,000.00\n\nThen all subsequent transactions (purchases, sales, expenses, interest receivable, etc.) are “posted” to one (or more) of the following four current–asset categories:\n • cash (or bank)\n • accounts receivable (for “Sales” recorded as “Unpaid”)\n • inventory (for ‘Purchase’ of trade products and then “reductions” by sale cost amounts)\n • interest receivable (all “Interest Receivables” in which the receivable is recorded)\n\nFor example, when a “Purchase” occurs the inventory balance increases by the purchase cost; if the purchase is “Paid” then the same amount is deducted immediately from cash (so the net effect on total current assets is nil) while if it is “Unpaid” (that is, on account) then the inventory goes up (to be “realized” later) and no cash is removed. In a “Sale” two effects occur. First, the revenue – if paid – is received into cash or – if not paid – it is recorded as an account receivable. Second, the inventory “leaves” at its cost. And when an “Expense” is paid the cash balance declines. (Depreciation is noncash and so is not considered.) Finally, each Interest Receivable entry increases the “interest receivable” portion of current assets.\n\nIf we “net‐up” all the postings (starting from an initial cash/bank total of 8,000,000 and zero for inventory, receivables and interest receivable) then after processing all 201 transactions the “final” balances turn out approximately to be\n\n • Cash ≈ 5,580,982  \n • Accounts Receivable ≈ 263,875  \n • Inventory ≈ 7,832,820  \n • Interest Receivable ≈ 9,067\n\nso that the final total current–assets balance is\n\n  5,580,982 + 263,875 + 7,832,820 + 9,067 ≈ 13,686,743.52\n\nThus, our answer is presented as follows.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"13686743.52\"\n  }\n}\n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nNote: In an exam or practice‐problem one “reproduces” the detailed cash, inventory and receivables postings step‐by‐step as done above; here the very many postings have been “summarized” so that the final computed current–assets total is as above.",
