                        "content": "We must “build” the current‐liability item by gathering those transactions that “create a payable” – that is, those purchase transactions that have an “Unpaid” status (with payment method “Account Payable” in our data). (Note that the “initial” entries were investments and fixed assets; no payables are recorded at the beginning so the “initial liabilities” are zero.)\n\nFor example, in our data the “Purchase” rows include many entries. Only those rows with Payment/receipt status “Unpaid” are recorded as a liability (the “Paid” ones have already been settled). (Other kinds of transactions – expenses, sales or interest receivables – do not add to accounts payable.) \n\nGoing through the list we find the following “Purchase” rows (by their id) and recorded amounts that are unpaid:\n\n• Purchase20231231002 – 829,440.00  \n• Purchase20231231004 – 1,250,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231005 – 246,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231007 – 140,800.00  \n• Purchase20231231008 – 254,320.00  \n• Purchase20231231011 – 540,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231013 – 585,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231014 – 755,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231015 – 59,850.00  \n• Purchase20231231019 – 32,850.00  \n• Purchase20231231022 – 19,050.00  \n• Purchase20231231023 – 358,500.00  \n• Purchase20231231024 – 402,000.00\n\nAdding these in order gives:\n\n 829,440.00  \n+ 1,250,000.00 = 2,079,440.00  \n+ 246,000.00 = 2,325,440.00  \n+ 140,800.00 = 2,466,240.00  \n+ 254,320.00 = 2,720,560.00  \n+ 540,000.00 = 3,260,560.00  \n+ 585,000.00 = 3,845,560.00  \n+ 755,000.00 = 4,600,560.00  \n+ 59,850.00 = 4,660,410.00  \n+ 32,850.00 = 4,693,260.00  \n+ 19,050.00 = 4,712,310.00  \n+ 358,500.00 = 5,070,810.00  \n+ 402,000.00 = 5,472,810.00\n\nThat is the total “unpaid accounts payable” at period‐end.\n\nBecause none of the “initial” transactions creates a liability (they are cash deposits, bank deposits and fixed asset purchases), the beginning value of current liabilities is 0.00.\n\nThus, our answer is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n     \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n     \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"5472810.00\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis is the result for the current‐liabilities item for the balance sheet based on the provided transactions.",
