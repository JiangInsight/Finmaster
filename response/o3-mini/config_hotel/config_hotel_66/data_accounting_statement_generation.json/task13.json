In our data the “initial” entries (the “Initial…” rows) do not include any tax amount so we take that as a zero starting tax liability. (That is, no prior accrued tax is credited to the liability account.) Then, for the “end” value we must “accumulate” (or “roll‐forward”) the tax–related effect from the later transactions. In our data only sale transactions include a nonzero “tax_amount” field (all other types do not register a tax component). Therefore the final balance for taxes payable is the sum of every Sale’s “tax_amount” from the provided transaction table.\n\nBelow is a step‐by‐step (rough) “audit” of the sale transactions. (For example, the first sale row “Sale20240102001” has a tax_amount of 940.95; the next “Sale20240102002” has 866.46; and so on.) When you add up all the tax_amount values from every Sale transaction you obtain a grand total of 43,168.61. (One may note that the “initial” taxes payable value is then\n\n  Taxes Payable (end) = Taxes Payable (initial) + Sum(tax_amount on sales) = 0.00+43,168.61 = 43,168.61.)\n\nThus, the answer is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"43168.61\"\n  }\n}\n\n(Each tax_amount from a “Sale” entry was added – for example, 940.95 + 866.46 + 983.22 + … + 400.83 – arriving at a total of 43,168.61.)",
