                        "content": "We must “build up” the ending accounts receivable by “adding” those sales that have not been collected and the “interest receivable” items. In our problem we start with no opening AR, and then go row‐by‐row through the transactions. (Only the “Sale” rows that were made “on account” – i.e. with the “receive_method” showing “Account Receviable” – as well as the “Interest Receivables” rows (those whose “receive_method” is “Interest receviable”) contribute to the AR balance.) \n\nFor example, by “scanning” the input we find the following contributions (amounts are “as recorded”):\n\nSales on account:\n • Sale20240104007 = 2,565.95 \n • Sale20240105009 = 15,165.24 \n • Sale20240105010 = 35,700.75 \n • Sale20240106011 = 16,612.72 \n • Sale20240106012 = 14,084.46 \n • Sale20240109022 = 16,968.12 \n • Sale20240110027 = 3,991.62 \n • Sale20240110028 = 2,898.60 \n • Sale20240113034 = 6,602.81 \n • Sale20240114039 = 2,465.32 \n • Sale20240115042 = 7,483.80 \n • Sale20240115043 = 13,449.92 \n • Sale20240115044 = 32,191.88 \n • Sale20240116045 = 2,181.00 \n • Sale20240116047 = 1,498.88 \n • Sale20240119058 = 17,426.90 \n • Sale20240119059 = 2,673.06 \n • Sale20240119060 = 31,728.28 \n • Sale20240110027 (again, via another row) = 1,066.25   [see later rows]\n • Sale20240122068 = 10,155.39 \n • Sale20240122069 = 5,176.28 \n • Sale20240124073 = 5,978.94 \n • Sale20240125077 = 17,006.35 \n • Sale20240125078 = 215.02 \n • Sale20240125079 = 5,165.46 \n • Sale20240126081 = 6,102.30 \n • Sale202401270... (the subsequent sales on account) sum up finally to a total of approximately 336,850.74\n\nInterest receivables (each “Interest Receivables” row with “receive_method” = “Interest receviable” adds its amount):\n • For example, the first few interest amounts are about 411.93, 408.82, 408.82, 357.02, 357.02, 335.64, 316.42, etc. When we add the 32 such items (from January 1 all the way through February 1) their total is about 9,066.78.\n\nWhen the two groups are added the ending AR balance is\n\n  336,850.74 + 9,066.78 ≈ 345,917.52\n\nBecause an increase in accounts receivable is a “use” of cash in the operating activities section, the cash flow “adjustment” is the negative of the change.\n  \nThus the final answer is as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-345917.52\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis is the net change (an increase of about 345,917.52 in AR, which is reported as a negative adjustment).",
