                        "content": "We need to “roll‐up” (sum) every transaction that records a “Sales Expenses” amount. In our list only the rows with type exactly “Sales Expenses” contribute; other expense types (for example “Administrative Expenses” or “Financial Expenses”) are not included. (For example, note that a “Sale” transaction is income, not an expense.) \n\nBelow is the step‐by‐step grouping of the Sales Expenses transactions (using the “amount” field) extracted from the table:\n\n1. Row “Expense20240106001” (Sales Expenses): 420.21  \n2. Another “Expense20240106001” (Sales Expenses): 207.85  \n  Subtotal = 420.21 + 207.85 = 628.06\n\n3. Row “Expense20240107001” (Sales Expenses): 618.18  \n  Subtotal becomes 628.06 + 618.18 = 1246.24\n\n4. Row “Expense20240109001” (Sales Expenses): 517.59  \n  Subtotal becomes 1246.24 + 517.59 = 1763.83\n\n5. Row “Expense20240112001” (Sales Expenses): 187.66  \n  Subtotal becomes 1763.83 + 187.66 = 1951.49\n\n6. Row “Expense20240114001” (for the Sales Expenses entry only from that group): 20961.17  \n  Subtotal becomes 1951.49 + 20961.17 = 22912.66\n\n7. Row “Expense20240116001” (Sales Expenses): 208.78  \n  Subtotal becomes 22912.66 + 208.78 = 23121.44\n\n8. Row “Expense20240117001” (Sales Expenses): 955.46  \n  Subtotal becomes 23121.44 + 955.46 = 24076.90\n\n9. Row “Expense20240120001” (Sales Expenses entry): 571.4  \n  Subtotal becomes 24076.90 + 571.4 = 24648.30\n\n10. Row “Expense20240122001” (Sales Expenses): 322.6  \n  Subtotal becomes 24648.30 + 322.6 = 24970.90\n\n11. Row “Expense20240124001” (Sales Expenses): 43338.25  \n  Subtotal becomes 24970.90 + 43338.25 = 68309.15\n\n12. Row “Expense20240125001” (Sales Expenses): 32264.01  \n  Subtotal becomes 68309.15 + 32264.01 = 100573.16\n\n13. Row “Expense20240127001” (Sales Expenses): 17136.65  \n  Subtotal becomes 100573.16 + 17136.65 = 117709.81\n\n14. Row “Expense20240128001” (Sales Expenses): 254.17  \n  Subtotal becomes 117709.81 + 254.17 = 117963.98\n\n15. Row “Expense20240131001” (Sales Expenses): 354.57  \n  Final total = 117963.98 + 354.57 = 118318.55\n\nThus, the final sales (selling) expenses total to 118318.55.\n\nWe now present our answer in the required JSON format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Selling Expenses\": \"118318.55\"}\n}",
