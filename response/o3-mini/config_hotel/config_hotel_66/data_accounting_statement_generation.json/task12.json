                        "content": "We must “reconstruct” your balance‐sheet liability “Accounts Payable” at period‑end by looking at all Purchase transaction lines where the supplier was “paid via account payable” – that is, the “Payment/receipt_status” is Unpaid and the “payment_method” is “Account Payable”. (Initial transactions do not record a payable.) \n\nStep‑by‑step, here is what we do:\n\n1. Look at every row with type “Purchase”. (Other transaction types like Expense, Sale, etc. are not “accounts payable” records.)  \n2. Among Purchases, select only those whose “payment/receipt_status” is “Unpaid” and whose “payment_method” is “Account Payable.”  \n3. Sum their “amount” values.\n\nGoing through the transaction table you provided, the ones we have are:\n\n• Purchase20231231002 – amount 829,440.0  \n• Purchase20231231004 – amount 1,250,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231005 – amount 246,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231007 – amount 140,800.0  \n• Purchase20231231008 – amount 254,320.0  \n• Purchase20231231011 – amount 540,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231013 – amount 585,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231014 – amount 755,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231015 – amount 59,850.0  \n• Purchase20231231019 – amount 32,850.0  \n• Purchase20231231022 – amount 19,050.0  \n• Purchase20231231023 – amount 358,500.0  \n• Purchase20231231024 – amount 402,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231015 (there is another one with that id – check sequence) – actually note that after Purchase20231231014 the next “Purchase” with Unpaid is Purchase20231231015 (already added) then later we have Purchase20231231019 then Purchase20231231022, then Purchase20231231023 then Purchase20231231024.\n\nNo initial entry (Initial20231231001) is recorded as accounts payable so the beginning balance is 0.\n\nNow add these amounts step‐by‐step:\n\n 829,440.0  \n+1,250,000.0 = 2,079,440.0  \n+246,000.0  = 2,325,440.0  \n+140,800.0  = 2,466,240.0  \n+254,320.0  = 2,720,560.0  \n+540,000.0  = 3,260,560.0  \n+585,000.0  = 3,845,560.0  \n+755,000.0  = 4,600,560.0  \n+59,850.0  = 4,660,410.0  \n+32,850.0  = 4,693,260.0  \n+19,050.0  = 4,712,310.0  \n+358,500.0  = 5,070,810.0  \n+402,000.0  = 5,472,810.0\n\nThus the ending balance in accounts payable is 5,472,810.00. (Throughout we use a “.00” format.)\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"5472810.00\"\n  }\n}",
