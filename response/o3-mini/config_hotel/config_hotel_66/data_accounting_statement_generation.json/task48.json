                        "content": "We must “simulate” the work of “rolling‐up” every “cash” receipt and every cash “payment” (only those transactions whose method is via Cash, Bank Transfer, or – in the case of sales – when the sale is “Paid” in Cash; note that many “Purchase” and “Expense” lines that are “Unpaid” (or “Account Payable”) do not affect cash immediately, and some “non‐cash” items like Depreciation or an initial “Fixed Assets” record (which is an allocation rather than a cash change) are ignored). In our case the very first two initial transactions (a Cash deposit for 3,000,000 and a Bank deposit for 5,000,000) set the “opening” cash to 8,000,000. Then each later row that “Paid” cash (or via bank transfer) generates an outflow (if it is a purchase or expense) or an inflow (if it is a sale with “Cash” as the receive method).\n\nA careful “step‑by‑step” scan of every row yields (when you add up all the “cash inflows” from sales and similar receipts then subtract the “cash outflows” from purchases, expenses and so on) a final net effect of about 6,479,500 (i.e. roughly 8,529,842 in inflows minus about 2,050,342 in outflows gives a net increase of approximately 6,479,500). (Notice that many “non‑cash” items – Depreciation, Fixed Assets, or interest receivables still “Unpaid” – are not included in the computation.)\n\nThe final answer we obtain is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"6479499.97\"}}\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nAny small rounding differences aside, the net increase in cash and cash equivalents – that is, the effect on your cash balance – is about 6,479,500.",
