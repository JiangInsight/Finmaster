                        "content": "We only “own” one non‐current asset account – the “Fixed Assets” that was in the initial posting – and no later acquisition was recorded as a fixed asset purchase. (All later “Purchase” entries are for items that are “sold” in later sale transactions – in other words, they are held as inventory rather than as long‐lived assets.) However, a depreciation expense (a non‑cash “write‑down” of the fixed assets’ book value) was recorded over the period.\n\nStep 1. The “Fixed Assets” initial balance (at 2023‑12‑31) was 8,000,000.00.\n\nStep 2. Two depreciation transactions were posted later:\n • Depreciation20240101001: 45,754.08 \n • Depreciation20240201002: 45,755.86\nTheir sum is 45,754.08 + 45,755.86 = 91,509.94.\n\nStep 3. The end (“book”) value of non‑current assets is the initial fixed asset amount minus total depreciation:\n  8,000,000.00 – 91,509.94 = 7,908,490.06\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '7908490.06'} }",
