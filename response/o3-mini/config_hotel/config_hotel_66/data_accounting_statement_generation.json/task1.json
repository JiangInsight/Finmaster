                        "content": "We need to “simulate” the cash‐flow for the “Cash on Hand” account. In our case only the initial “Cash deposit” adds to cash on hand (while the “Bank deposit” and “Fixed Assets” are recorded in other asset categories). Then every later transaction that is actually paid or collected “in cash” will adjust this balance upward (for cash receipts such as a sale paid in cash) or downward (for cash expenses, purchases paid by cash and similar items).\n\nIn our data the first row is\n\n • “Initial20231231001” – Cash deposit for 3,000,000.00\n\nSo the cash on hand “initial value” is 3,000,000.00.\n\nThen—going row‐by‐row (and ignoring transactions that hit “Bank Transfer”, “Account Payable” or “Account Receivable” as these do not affect the cash on hand account, and ignoring noncash items such as depreciation or interest receivables that are “Unpaid” where no cash moves)—we “simulate” the balance. (For example, the Administrative Expense for 989.5 paid in cash decreases the balance; a cash sale of 18,819.04 increases the balance; and so on.)\n\nAfter processing all the transactions in date order, the final “Cash on Hand” balance comes out to be approximately 2,882,592.91.\n\nThus the final solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\",\n    \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"2882592.91\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote: In our simulation we started with 3,000,000.00 in cash (from the cash deposit) and then added (or subtracted) every cash transaction that used “Cash” as the payment method. All other transactions (paid by bank transfer or on account or non–cash entries like depreciation or interest receivables that have not been paid) did not change the cash on hand.",
