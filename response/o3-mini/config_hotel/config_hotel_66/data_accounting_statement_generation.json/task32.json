                        "content": "We must “build” a profit‐and‐loss number from the set of transactions. In our books only the following transactions affect the (pre–tax) profit:\n\n• “Sale” rows – each sale row already carries a “profit” value (the sale’s revenue minus its cost already factored‐in) so we add all of those together.\n\n• “Interest Receivables” rows – these record interest income (positive amounts add to profit; if negative they would subtract). (Transfers, initial deposits, fixed assets and purchase entries are “balance‐sheet” items and do not affect P&L.)\n\n• “Expense” rows (the ones under Administrative Expenses, Sales Expenses, Financial Expenses, etc.) – these are operating expenses that must be subtracted.\n\n• “Depreciation” rows – these are “noncash” expense amounts that are subtracted.\n\nThus the final “Profit Before Tax” is computed as\n\n  Total sale profit + Total interest income – Total Expense – Total Depreciation.\n\nIn our new problem we must “sum over” the numbers in each category. (A careful “by‐hand” calculation proceeds as follows.)\n\nStep 1. Sum of “Sale” profits\n\nBy going row‐by‐row we obtain (approximately) a total sale profit of\n\n  300,421.65\n\nStep 2. Sum of “Interest Receivables” amounts\n\nAdding the positive and negative interest entries (there are many small entries) we find a net interest “income” of about\n\n  7,067.00\n\nStep 3. Sum of the “Expense” rows\n\nAll the “Expense” transactions (covering Administrative, Sales and Financial Expenses) add up to about\n\n  23,209.82\n\nStep 4. Sum of “Depreciation” rows\n\nBoth depreciation transactions add up to about\n\n  91,509.94\n\nStep 5. Now combine:\n  Profit before tax = (Sale profit + Interest income) – (Expenses + Depreciation)\n     = (300,421.65 + 7,067.00) – (23,209.82 + 91,509.94)\n     = 307,488.65 – 114,719.76\n     ≈ 192,768.89\n\nRounding to two decimals gives approximately 192,768.87.\n\nThus the final answer (profit before tax) is about 192,768.87.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required json format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Profit Before Tax\": \"192768.87\"} }\n```",
