                        "content": "We must “build” an inventory “balance” by “tracking” the purchases (which add inventory) made on December 31, 2023 – the “initial inventory” – and then “subtract” the cost of goods that were “sold” during January and early February 2024 (the “cost_amount” in each sale row). In our data every “Purchase…” row on 2023‐12‐31 gives a cost (amount) that is “added” into inventory. (Notice that the “Initial” rows, even though they appear, are not “inventory” but rather cash, bank, fixed assets.) Then every “Sale…” row shows its “cost_amount” – that is the cost “credited” out of inventory when a sale takes place.\n\nStep 1. Compute the total “purchase” cost (the sum of the “amount” fields in the Purchase rows):\n\n• Purchase20231231001:     371520.0  \n• Purchase20231231002:     829440.0  \n• Purchase20231231003:     35000.0  \n• Purchase20231231004:     1250000.0  \n• Purchase20231231005:     246000.0  \n• Purchase20231231006:     582000.0  \n• Purchase20231231007:     140800.0  \n• Purchase20231231008:     254320.0  \n• Purchase20231231009:     240240.0  \n• Purchase20231231010:     216000.0  \n• Purchase20231231011:     540000.0  \n• Purchase20231231012:     177000.0  \n• Purchase20231231013:     585000.0  \n• Purchase20231231014:     755000.0  \n• Purchase20231231015:     59850.0  \n• Purchase20231231016:     820800.0  \n• Purchase20231231017:     80500.0  \n• Purchase20231231018:     328000.0  \n• Purchase20231231019:     32850.0  \n• Purchase20231231020:     36050.0  \n• Purchase20231231021:     35850.0  \n• Purchase20231231022:     19050.0  \n• Purchase20231231023:     358500.0  \n• Purchase20231231024:     402000.0  \n\nIf you add these (and you may check step‐by‐step) you obtain an “inventory initial value” equal to\n\n  8,387,770.00\n\nStep 2. Next, from the “Sale…” rows we “remove” (or credit out) the costs that have been “sold.” (In these records the “cost_amount” is given for each sale.) When we add up all the cost_amount values from the sale lines we get a total cost of goods “sold” equal to\n\n  680,480.00\n\n(One way to see this is to note that if you sum over all 81 sale transactions – each “Sale…” row carries its “cost_amount” value – you get 680,480.00.)\n\nStep 3. Then the ending inventory is simply the beginning inventory (total purchase cost) less the cost of goods sold:\n\n  Inventory End Value = 8,387,770.00 – 680,480.00 = 7,707,290.00\n\nThus the two “balance sheet” numbers in our inventory item are:\n\n• Inventory Initial Value: 8387770.00  \n• Inventory End Value: 7707290.00\n\nNow we present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n",
