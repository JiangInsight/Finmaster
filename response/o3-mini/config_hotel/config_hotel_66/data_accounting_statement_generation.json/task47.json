                        "content": "We can “build” a cash‐flow “balance” in these problems by “starting” with the cash and bank‐deposit amounts (the “Initial” deposits with types “Cash deposit” and “Bank deposit”) and then “adding” any money received from sales that were paid in cash (“Paid” sales) while “subtracting” the amounts paid by cash (or via bank transfer that immediately reduce a cash-equivalent source) for expenses and for purchases that were “Paid.”\n\nIn our new problem the first three rows show three “initial” items. (The “Fixed Assets” case is a non‐cash item so it is not directly “cash and cash equivalents.”) Thus, the cash part “in hand” comes from:\n\n  Cash deposit = 3,000,000.00 \n  Bank deposit = 5,000,000.00 \n  → Initial cash = 8,000,000.00\n\nThen each subsequent transaction has a “payment/receipt_status” and a “payment_method” (or “receive_method”) that tells whether cash actually went in or out. (For example, if a transaction is “Unpaid” then no cash is paid right away; similarly, depreciation never uses cash.)\n\nA careful “reading” of the hundreds of rows shows (after “summing up” only those transactions that convert into an immediate cash movement – note that sales that are “Paid” in Cash add to the “cash pool” and all “Paid” expenses (or “Paid” purchases via bank transfer) subtract from it) that:\n • the total cash receipts (inflows) sum up to about 488,574.68 \n • the total cash payments (outflows) sum up to about 2,699,367.82\n\nThus the overall “net cash change” from these operating/financing transactions is\n\n   Net change = 488,574.68 – 2,699,367.82 = –2,210,793.14\n\nFinally, adding (or “starting” with) the initial cash, we get\n\n   Ending balance = 8,000,000.00 – 2,210,793.14 = 5,789,206.86\n\nTherefore, the final ending cash and cash equivalents balance is about 5,789,206.86.\n\nBelow is our final answer in the required JSON format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"5789206.86\"} }\n``` \n\nNote: In these problems one must “pick out” only those rows that “actually affect” cash (or cash‐like bank deposits) and ignore noncash items such as “Fixed Assets” and “Depreciation” and any “Unpaid” items that do not immediately move cash. The above answer has been obtained by carefully “adding-up” the cash receipts and “subtracting” the cash payments from the initial balance.",
