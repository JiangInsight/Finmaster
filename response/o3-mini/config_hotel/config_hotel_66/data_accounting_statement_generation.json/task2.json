                        "content": "We start with an “initial” bank deposit record. In our table the second row shows a “Bank deposit” of 5,000,000.00 on 2023‑12‑31. That is the starting (initial) amount in the bank deposits account.\n\nNext we need to adjust that balance by any cash movements that affect the bank deposit. In our table the only “cash‐movement” that comes directly from the bank account is when the payment method is “Bank Transfer” (i.e. money is drawn from the bank account to pay for an expense or purchase).\n\nScanning through the table we identify the rows with “Bank Transfer” as the payment method (and that are “Paid”):\n\n1. Row with id “Purchase20231231001” – amount = 371,520.00 (Payment method Bank Transfer)\n2. Row with id “Purchase20231231003” – amount = 35,000.00 (Paid by Bank Transfer)\n3. Row with id “Purchase20231231006” – amount = 582,000.00 (Paid by Bank Transfer)\n4. Row with id “Purchase20231231009” – amount = 240,240.00 (Paid by Bank Transfer)\n5. Row with id “Purchase20231231010” – amount = 216,000.00 (Paid by Bank Transfer)\n6. Row with id “Purchase20231231016” – amount = 820,800.00 (Paid by Bank Transfer)\n7. Row with id “Purchase20231231020” – amount = 36,050.00 (Paid by Bank Transfer)\n\n(Other purchase rows are either “Unpaid” or paid by other means and so do not immediately alter the bank deposits.)\n\nWe now sum these bank‑transfer outflows:\n  371,520.00 + 35,000.00 = 406,520.00  \n  406,520.00 + 582,000.00 = 988,520.00  \n  988,520.00 + 240,240.00 = 1,228,760.00  \n  1,228,760.00 + 216,000.00 = 1,444,760.00  \n  1,444,760.00 + 820,800.00 = 2,265,560.00  \n  2,265,560.00 + 36,050.00 = 2,301,610.00  \n\nThus the total amount paid out via Bank Transfer is 2,301,610.00.\n\nFinally, the ending bank deposit balance is the initial bank deposit minus these outflows:\n  5,000,000.00 – 2,301,610.00 = 2,698,390.00\n\nWe then round (or format) to two decimal places.\n\nThus the answer is:\n---------------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {'Bank Deposits Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Bank Deposits End Value': '2698390.00'} }",
