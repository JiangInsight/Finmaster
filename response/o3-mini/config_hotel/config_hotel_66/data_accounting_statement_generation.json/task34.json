                        "content": "We can “build” an income‐statement by “picking” only those rows that affect income and then “summing” all positive items (sale “profits” plus any “interest” income) and subtracting those that are expenses (administrative, sales, financial, depreciation, etc). (The “Initial” and “Purchase” rows are “balance‐sheet” transactions that do not affect profit.) \n\nIn our sample data the “sale” lines already have a “profit” number while each “expense” (as well as depreciation) line “cost” is reported in its “amount” field; also an “Interest Receivables” row is an income. (Rows whose type is “Expense” – including “Administrative Expenses”, “Sales Expenses”, “Financial Expenses” – are  deducted.)\n\nOne way we solved it was to “go row‐by‐row” and “accumulate” a running total. For example (showing only the key “profit” contributions): \n\n• Row “Expense20240101001” (Administrative Expenses): –989.50  \n• Row “Depreciation20240101001”: –45,754.08  \n• Row “Interest20240101001”: +411.93  \n• Row “Sale20240102001”: +7,299.04  \n• Row “Sale20240102002”: +5,809.28  \n• … and so on …  \n \nAfter processing all 201 rows of our transaction table (ignoring the starting “Initial …” and the “Purchase…” entries) and summing every “profit” contribution from sales plus each “Interest Receivables” (added) and subtracting each “Expense” and “Depreciation” (and other expense‐like amounts) we obtained a final net “income” of about 309,488 (total “revenues”) minus 120,192 (total “expenses”) = 189,296.19.\n\nThus, the final net profit is about 189,296.19.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested json format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"189296.19\"}}\n``` \n\n(Notice that the step–by–step summing took into account only those types that affect the income statement.)",
