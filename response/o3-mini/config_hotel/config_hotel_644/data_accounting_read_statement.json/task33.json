We need to extract income arising in the course of the entity’s core operating activities; this corresponds to the “Main Business Revenue” with a value of 836813.79.\n2. We also need to extract the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period; this is given by the “Cost of Goods Sold” value which is 544970.00.\n3. We maintain the original order from the income statement: \"Main Business Revenue\" comes first and \"Cost of Goods Sold\" second.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '836813.79', 'value2': '544970.00'}}",
