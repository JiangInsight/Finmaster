Its End_amount is 16000000.00.\n\n2. Profit (or loss) for the period before deducting tax expense is given by \"Profit Before Tax\" (Income Statement). Its Amount is 141372.99.\n\n3. The addition in the amount owed for goods or services received on credit is reflected by \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" in the Cash Flow statement. Its Amount is 5596070.00.\n\nFollowing the grouping order (balance sheet first, then income statement, then cash flow), our answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value1\": \"16000000.00\",\n    \"value2\": \"141372.99\",\n    \"value3\": \"5596070.00\"\n  }\n}",
