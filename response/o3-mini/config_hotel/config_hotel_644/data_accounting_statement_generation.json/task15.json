                        "content": "We need to “find the liabilities” in the balance sheet. Liabilities (for our purposes) come from payable‐items that were not “paid” – that is, any (purchase) transactions that were recorded with an “Unpaid” status and that used a payment method of “Account Payable.” (The “Initial” transactions – deposits and fixed assets – represent assets; no “Initial” liability is recorded.) \n\nStep‐by‐step, we scan the list and pick out only those “Purchase” rows (or similar) that have “Unpaid” as their payment/receipt_status and where the payment method is “Account Payable.” In our data these are:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001 – amount = 809,280.00  \n2. Purchase20231231002 – amount = 19,650.00  \n3. Purchase20231231005 – amount = 44,850.00  \n4. Purchase20231231006 – amount = 605,000.00  \n5. Purchase20231231007 – amount = 75,250.00  \n6. Purchase20231231012 – amount = 100,800.00  \n7. Purchase20231231013 – amount = 596,000.00  \n8. Purchase20231231015 – amount = 1,470,000.00  \n9. Purchase20231231016 – amount = 700,000.00  \n10. Purchase20231231017 – amount = 218,240.00  \n11. Purchase20231231018 – amount = 399,000.00  \n12. Purchase20231231020 – amount = 558,000.00  \n\n(The other “Purchase” rows were either paid or were not recorded using “Account Payable”; such amounts are not counted as outstanding liabilities.) \n\nWe add these up step‐by‐step:\n\n 809,280.00  \n+ 19,650.00 = 828,930.00  \n+ 44,850.00 = 873,780.00  \n+ 605,000.00 = 1,478,780.00  \n+ 75,250.00 = 1,554,030.00  \n+ 100,800.00 = 1,654,830.00  \n+ 596,000.00 = 2,250,830.00  \n+ 1,470,000.00 = 3,720,830.00  \n+ 700,000.00 = 4,420,830.00  \n+ 218,240.00 = 4,639,070.00  \n+ 399,000.00 = 5,038,070.00  \n+ 558,000.00 = 5,596,070.00  \n\nSince there is no “Initial” liability row (the “Initial” rows in our data are asset-related), the Total Liabilities Initial Value is 0 and the Total Liabilities End Value (from the outstanding “unpaid” purchases recorded on account) is 5,596,070.00.\n\nThe answer in the requested JSON format is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \n    \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"5596070.00\"\n  }\n}\n--------------------------------------------------",
