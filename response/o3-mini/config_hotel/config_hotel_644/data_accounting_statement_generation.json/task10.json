                        "content": "We start by noting that the “Fixed Assets” on 2023‑12‑31 (as given in the “Initial” transaction) form the opening non‐current asset balance. Then during the period additional fixed asset purchases are made via “Fixed Assets Purchase” transactions. Finally, scheduled depreciation(s) reduce the carrying amount.\n\nStep 1. Opening balance (initial non‐current assets):\n• From the “Initial20231231001” row with type “Fixed Assets” the amount is 8,000,000.00\n\nStep 2. Additions (capitalized fixed asset purchases)\nWe review the transactions having type “Fixed Assets Purchase”. In our data these are the rows (note: although the id appears the same, each row represents a separate asset addition):\n\n1. A row with amount = 455,144.64 \n  (asset “Elevator System4”)\n2. A row with amount = 374,964.45 \n  (asset “Kitchen Equipment5”)\n3. A row with amount = 1,495,645.80 \n  (asset “Renovation Project6”)\n4. A row with amount = 625,338.59 \n  (asset “Elevator System7”)\n5. A row with amount = 464,570.86 \n  (asset “Kitchen Equipment8”)\n\nLet’s sum these additions:\n  455,144.64 + 374,964.45 = 830,109.09  \n  830,109.09 + 1,495,645.80 = 2,325,754.89  \n  2,325,754.89 + 625,338.59 = 2,951,093.48  \n  2,951,093.48 + 464,570.86 = 3,415,664.34\n\nStep 3. Depreciation during the period\nThere are two depreciation transactions:\n• Depreciation20240101001 with 45,751.50  \n• Depreciation20240201002 with 86,352.28\n\nTheir total depreciation is:\n  45,751.50 + 86,352.28 = 132,103.78\n\nStep 4. Compute final (end‑of‑period) non‐current assets\nWe add the opening balance and fixed asset purchases, then subtract depreciation:\n  Opening 8,000,000.00  \n  + Additions 3,415,664.34  \n  = 11,415,664.34  \n  – Depreciation 132,103.78  \n  = 11,283,560.56\n\nThus the balance sheet “Property, plant and non‐current assets” item has:\n• Initial Value: 8,000,000.00 \n• End Value: 11,283,560.56 \n\nNow we present the answer as requested:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"11283560.56\"\n  }\n}",
