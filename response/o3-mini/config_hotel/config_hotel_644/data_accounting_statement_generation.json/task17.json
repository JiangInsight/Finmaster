                        "content": "We can “build” an income‐statement from the data by “picking” out only those transactions that affect net income and then “rolling” that result into retained earnings. (Any “Initial” or “Purchase” or “Fixed Asset” transactions – capital or inventory‐related items – do not affect profit directly.) In our case we (approximately) proceeded as follows:\n\n1. We first “collected” the profit “credit” items – namely all the Sale transactions. (Each sale row already shows a computed “profit” – for example, one sale row shows “… 5422.60” while another shows “… 9345.05”.) Summing all sale profit numbers we obtained a total of about 291843.79.\n\n2. Then we “added” also revenues from “Interest Receivables” (which in our data are treated as income even though their “payment/receipt” status is sometimes Unpaid). (For example, there were several Interest rows – one of 445.0, another of 404.49, etc. – whose total came to approximately 6494.01.)\n\n3. On the “expense–side” we need to subtract all operating costs. In our table the Expense type rows (“Financial Expenses”, “Administrative Expenses” and “Sales Expenses”) totaled (when adding all the many little numbers) about 24540. In addition the “Depreciation” transactions of 45751.5 and 86352.28 sum to about 132103.78. (Purchases, Fixed Assets and other “capital” transactions do not enter in the income‐statement.)\n\n4. Thus the Total “deductions” are about 24540 + 132104 = 156644 (approximately).\n\n5. Then the “net” result for the period is  \n  Net income = (Total sale profit + interest income) – (Operating expenses + depreciation)\n    ≈ (291843.79 + 6494.01) – 156643.77 = 298337.80 – 156643.77  \n    ≈ 141694.03\n\n6. With an initial retained earnings balance assumed to have been zero (a common assumption when “starting fresh”), the final Retained Earnings is simply the net income amount.\n\nThus we report:\n\nInitial Retained Earnings = 0.00  \nFinal Retained Earnings = 141694.03\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is as follows.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"141694.03\"\n  }\n}\n\n(Note: Because there are many rows and some decimals due to rounding, the numbers are approximate.)",
