                        "content": "We need to “pick out” and add together every transaction that is recorded as an expense (or “depreciation”) in the table. In our data the “type” field tells us what the record is. For example, if the type begins with “Expense” (as in “Administrative Expenses”, “Sales Expenses” or “Financial Expenses”) or is a “Depreciation” record, then its amount is treated as an expense. (Other types such as “Purchase”, “Sale”, “Initial”, “Fixed Assets Purchase”, “Transfer” or “Interest Receivables” are not “expenses”.)\n\nBelow is one way to reason about the procedure:\n\n1. Look over every row.\n2. If the “type” field is one of:\n  • “Administrative Expenses”\n  • “Sales Expenses”\n  • “Financial Expenses”\n  • “Depreciation”\nthen add its “amount” field (the “recorded_amount” is the same in our input).\n\n3. In our new table the expense‐related rows are as follows (with their “amount” values):\n  – Expense20240101001 (Financial Expenses):  838.08  \n  – Depreciation20240101001 (Depreciation):  45751.5  \n  – Expense20240102001 (Administrative Expenses): 148.6  \n  – Expense20240103001 (Sales Expenses): 745.04  \n  – Expense20240104001 (Administrative Expenses): 466.05  \n  – Expense20240104001 (Sales Expenses): 276.48  \n  – Expense20240105001 (Administrative Expenses): 970.96  \n  – Expense20240106001 (Sales Expenses): 921.96  \n  – Expense20240106001 (Administrative Expenses): 480.42  \n  – Expense20240107001 (Administrative Expenses): 361.62  \n  – Expense20240107001 (Administrative Expenses): 599.97  \n  – Expense20240108001 (Administrative Expenses): 618.7  \n  – Expense20240109001 (Administrative Expenses): 571.42  \n  – Expense20240110001 (Administrative Expenses): 828.87  \n  – Expense20240111001 (Sales Expenses): 974.45  \n  – Expense20240111001 (Administrative Expenses): 784.65  \n  – Expense20240112001 (Administrative Expenses): 599.05  \n  – Expense20240113001 (Administrative Expenses): 946.35  \n  – Expense20240114001 (Administrative Expenses): 611.85  \n  – Expense20240115001 (Administrative Expenses): 108.28  \n  – Expense20240115001 (Administrative Expenses): 411.38  \n  – Expense20240116001 (Administrative Expenses): 222.55  \n  – Expense20240117001 (Administrative Expenses): 853.17  \n  – Expense20240117001 (Administrative Expenses): 403.7  \n  – Expense20240118001 (Sales Expenses): 321.05  \n  – Expense20240119001 (Sales Expenses): 909.72  \n  – Expense20240120001 (Administrative Expenses): 634.88  \n  – Expense20240120001 (Sales Expenses): 807.74  \n  – Expense20240121001 (Administrative Expenses): 316.47  \n  – Expense20240121001 (Sales Expenses): 269.41  \n  – Expense20240122001 (Administrative Expenses): 664.89  \n  – Expense20240122001 (Sales Expenses): 615.23  \n  – Expense20240123001 (Financial Expenses): 960.64  \n  – Expense20240124001 (Administrative Expenses): 220.46  \n  – Expense20240125001 (Administrative Expenses): 894.09  \n  – Expense20240125001 (Sales Expenses): 131.75  \n  – Expense20240126001 (Sales Expenses): 892.97  \n  – Expense20240126001 (Sales Expenses): 136.4  \n  – Expense20240127001 (Financial Expenses): 771.17  \n  – Expense20240127001 (Sales Expenses): 482.74  \n  – Expense20240128001 (Administrative Expenses): 282.54  \n  – Expense20240129001 (Sales Expenses): 496.78  \n  – Expense20240130001 (Sales Expenses): 448.51  \n  – Expense20240131001 (Financial Expenses): 105.38  \n  – Expense20240131001 (Administrative Expenses): 299.98  \n  – Expense20240201001 (Sales Expenses): 454.64  \n  – Depreciation20240201002 (Depreciation): 86352.28  \n  – Plus the depreciation already recorded in row 6 (45751.5).\n\n4. When you add them all step‐by‐step (as done in our running “sum”) the final total amounts to 156964.82.\n\nFor clarity, the running sum was built as follows (each “+” indicates that an expense row’s amount was added):\n  Initially 0  \n  + 838.08 = 838.08  \n  + 45751.5 = 46589.58  \n  + 148.6 = 46738.18  \n  + 745.04 = 47483.22  \n  + 466.05 = 47949.27  \n  + 276.48 = 48225.75  \n  + 970.96 = 49196.71  \n  + 921.96 = 50118.67  \n  + 480.42 = 50599.09  \n  + 361.62 = 50960.71  \n  + 599.97 = 51560.68  \n  + 618.7 = 52179.38  \n  + 571.42 = 52750.80  \n  + 828.87 = 53579.67  \n  + 974.45 = 54554.12  \n  + 784.65 = 55338.77  \n  + 599.05 = 55937.82  \n  + 946.35 = 56884.17  \n  + 611.85 = 57496.02  \n  + 108.28 = 57604.30  \n  + 411.38 = 58015.68  \n  + 222.55 = 58238.23  \n  + 853.17 = 59091.40  \n  + 403.70 = 59495.10  \n  + 321.05 = 59816.15  \n  + 909.72 = 60725.87  \n  + 634.88 = 61360.75  \n  + 807.74 = 62168.49  \n  + 316.47 = 62484.96  \n  + 269.41 = 62754.37  \n  + 664.89 = 63419.26  \n  + 615.23 = 64034.49  \n  + 960.64 = 64995.13  \n  + 220.46 = 65215.59  \n  + 894.09 = 66109.68  \n  + 131.75 = 66241.43  \n  + 892.97 = 67134.40  \n  + 136.4 = 67270.80  \n  + 771.17 = 68041.97  \n  + 482.74 = 68524.71  \n  + 282.54 = 68807.25  \n  + 496.78 = 69304.03  \n  + 448.51 = 69752.54  \n  + 105.38 = 69857.92  \n  + 299.98 = 70157.90  \n  + 454.64 = 70612.54  \n  + 86352.28 = 70612.54 + 86352.28 = 156964.82  \n\nThus the “final total expenses” value is 156964.82.\n\nTherefore the answer is presented as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Expenses\": \"156964.82\"} }\n```",
