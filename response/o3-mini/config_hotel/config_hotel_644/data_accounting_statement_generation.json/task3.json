                        "content": "We “build” an ending inventory value by “adding” all acquired items (via purchase transactions) and “reducing” by the cost‐of–goods sold which is recorded on sales transactions. In our example the inventory “balance” is computed as follows:\n\n1. (a) Sum up the purchase totals for products that are held as inventory. In our new problem the “Purchase” transactions that carry product information have the following purchase amounts (which equal the “amount” field):\n\n  • Purchase20231231001   809280.00  \n  • Purchase20231231002    19650.00  \n  • Purchase20231231003    19050.00  \n  • Purchase20231231004   639360.00  \n  • Purchase20231231005    44850.00  \n  • Purchase20231231006   605000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231007    75250.00  \n  • Purchase20231231008   460800.00  \n  • Purchase20231231009   181280.00  \n  • Purchase20231231010   448000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231011    88550.00  \n  • Purchase20231231012   100800.00  \n  • Purchase20231231013   596000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231014   396000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231015   1470000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231016   700000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231017    218240.00  \n  • Purchase20231231018   399000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231019    162800.00  \n  • Purchase20231231020   558000.00\n\nAdding these together gives a total purchase (acquisition) cost of: \n\n  7,991,910.00\n\n(b) Next, we “remove” what has “left inventory” via sales. In our sales transactions the “cost_amount” field represents the cost of the product that was “sold” (and so should be subtracted from inventory). Adding all the cost amounts in the “Sale” transactions we get a total cost‐of–goods–sold of:\n\n  544,960.00\n\n2. With no “beginning inventory” on the first day (we assume that any goods on hand before these transactions are zero), the ending inventory is simply:\n\n  Ending Inventory = (Total Purchases – Cost of Sales) = 7,991,910.00 – 544,960.00 = 7,446,950.00\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Inventory End Value\": \"7446950.00\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote: The “purchases” add to the inventory pool and each sale reduces it by the cost amount recorded; therefore, even though many other types of entries appear (such as fixed assets, expense entries and interest‐related items) only those “Purchase” entries that add a product component and the “cost_amount” in the “Sale” entries are used for inventory (“merchandise” or “stock”) valuation.",
