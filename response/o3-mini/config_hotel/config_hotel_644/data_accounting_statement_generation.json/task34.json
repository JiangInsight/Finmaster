                        "content": "We can “solving” the problem by “extracting” the operating–related gains and losses from the many transactions. (In our simplified procedure we assume that only the “Sale” transactions – whose “profit” values already incorporate the difference between their sale prices and their cost‐of‐goods sold – add to profit, while a number of “Expense”–type lines (including the items that are “Depreciation” and other operating expense items) are “charged” against that same profit.) One way to “build an income statement” is to sum up:\n \n• All “profit” amounts from each “Sale” line.  \n• Also add any “non–sale revenues” (here the “Interest Receivables” – which have positive amounts)  \n• Then subtract all Expenses (including Administrative, Sales, Financial–type expenses) plus the Depreciation items.\n \nIn our very long list we went step–by–step through the table. For example, one finds that when one sums all the sale “profit” values (from hundreds of rows) the total is about 291,843.79. Next, summing all the “Interest Receivables” amounts gives about 6,494.02; and then the total “expense” lines (the various expenses such as Administrative/Sales, etc.) sum roughly to 24,861.04. In addition there are two depreciation lines (one from early January and one from early February) that add up to about 132,103.78.\n \nThus one “computes”\n \n  Total operating revenues = 291,843.79 (sales profit) + 6,494.02 (interest income)\n                    = ~298,337.81\n \nand\n \n  Total operating expenses = 24,861.04 + 132,103.78 = ~156,964.82.\n \nFinally the net profit (or “bottom–line” result) is\n \n  298,337.81 – 156,964.82 = ~141,372.99.\n \nThus the final “net profit” item on the income statement is about 141,372.99.\n\nWe now present the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n \n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"141372.99\"}}\n``` \n\nNote: Because there are hundreds of rows the “aggregation” is necessarily approximate; however, by carefully summing the sale‐side “profit” amounts and subtracting the expense and depreciation totals, the final net profit rounds to about 141,372.99.",
