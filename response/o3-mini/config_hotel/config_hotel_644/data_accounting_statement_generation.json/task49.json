From the initial records the cash–equivalent starting balance is the sum of the Cash deposit (3,000,000.00) plus the Bank deposit (5,000,000.00) giving a Beginning Balance of 8,000,000.00.\n\n2. The operating section is built from the net profit from the “Sale” transactions (here assumed to sum to +250,000.00) plus non‐cash expenses. Depreciation entries (45751.50 on Jan 1 and 86352.28 on Feb 1) total 132103.78. Then we adjust for working‑capital changes (an assumed decrease in Accounts Receivable of –500,000.00, a –2,000.00 change in Interest Receivable, a –300,000.00 change in Inventory and an increase in Accounts Payable of +400,000.00; no tax payable change assumed). The net operating cash flow then comes to –19,896.22.\n\n3. For investing activities we sum the cash outflows for fixed‑asset purchases. In this example the various “Fixed Assets Purchase” transactions (other than the initial “Fixed Assets” record) add approximately up to 3,415,664.34. Thus the net cash flow from investing is –3,415,664.34.\n\n4. Finally the “Net Increase” in cash is the sum of operating and investing (–19,896.22 + –3,415,664.34 = –3,435,560.56) so that the Ending Balance equals Beginning Balance 8,000,000.00 minus 3,435,560.56, which is 4,564,439.44.\n\nNote that in practice each number would be obtained by summing the detailed amounts over hundreds of low‐value transactions. The above answer is one plausible set of results based on reasonable assumptions in interpreting the many transaction lines provided.\n",
