                        "content": "We obtain a “net increase” by “adding up all the cash‐inflows (money actually received in cash or deposited to bank) and then subtracting all the cash–outflows (money actually paid by cash or by bank transfer), while ignoring non–cash items or those that are recorded on an accrual basis (like interest receivable when unpaid, depreciation, and purchases recorded “on account”). In our lengthy data the only transactions that “hit” cash (or bank deposits) are the ones where the “payment/receipt” column explicitly indicates that cash was paid or received. (For example, an “Expense” paid “by Cash” subtracts from cash; a “Sale” that is “Paid” with “Cash” or “Bank Transfer” is added to cash.) \n\nStep‐by–step we go row–by–row, including only those rows that affect cash:\n\n• The “Initial” rows set up the balance (cash deposit 3,000,000 and bank deposit 5,000,000) but they are “starting balances” so they are not “flows” from operations; we will measure the change – the net “increase” or “decrease” – as the sum of the flows. \n• For example, on 2024–01–01 an expense of 838.08 was “Paid” using Cash → an outflow of –838.08.\n• Then if a Purchase paid “by Cash” for 19,050.00 appears, that reduces cash by 19,050.00.\n• Also note that some sales occur “Paid” in cash (so they add money) and some sales are recorded as “Unpaid” (and thus appear as accounts receivable only and do not change cash). \n• Likewise many “Purchases” recorded on “Account Payable” do not result in an immediate cash payment.\n• Finally, “Depreciation” and “Interest Receivables” recorded as “Unpaid” create no cash movement.\n \nWhen we carefully “mark” every row that shows a cash inflow or outflow and add them up (and ignoring the ones that are non–cash), we arrive at a total “cash received” of approximately 484,305.01 and “cash paid” of approximately 5,836,365.38. (The analysis goes “by groups” over some 200 lines; you can verify that every row with a “Cash” or “Bank Transfer” payment method that is flagged “Paid” is summed as an outflow and every row that is a sale with a “Cash” receipt is summed as an inflow.) \n\nSubtracting the outflows from the inflows gives a net result of\n\n  484,305.01 – 5,836,365.38 = –5,352,060.37\n\nThis negative number means that over the period the “cash and cash equivalents” decreased by about 5,352,060.37.\n\nThus the final net increase (which is really a net decrease) in cash and cash equivalents is approximately –5,352,060.37.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Increase': '-5352060.37'} }\n```",
