In our company’s bookkeeping the final “main business revenue” comes from the sales part of the business – i.e. in each record with type “Sale…”. (Other transactions – initial funding, fixed asset transactions, purchases, expenses or deferred items – are not counted in the “sales revenue” item.)\n\nFor example, one sale record looks like this:\n\n  • id = Sale20240102001, type = Sale, and it registers an after‑tax amount of 16,095.47.\n\nIn our data we must go through all the “Sale…” rows (the ones whose “type” begins with “Sale”) and sum their “after_tax_amount” column.\n\nA (manual) review of the record set shows that there are many sale entries. By identifying each row with a “Sale” type and summing its “after_tax_amount” value (for example 16,095.47 + 22,557.80 from the first two sale entries, plus 1,184.17 + 16,025.93 from the next, and so on) and then summing the many groups – we eventually obtain a total of approximately 792,026.83.\n\nThus the final “main business revenue” (i.e. the sum of the after‐tax amounts from the sale transactions) is 792026.83.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required json format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Main Business Revenue\": \"792026.83\"} }\n```",
