                        "content": "We obtain the final “operating” cash‐flow by “walking” through the transaction list and adding only the movements that affect operating cash. In our case the idea was to include (only when the cash has actually been paid/received) items of type “Sale” (inflows), “Expense” (outflows) and “Purchase” (outflows) – while ignoring non–operational items (the “Initial…” deposits, “Fixed Assets” or “FixedAsset…” lines, “Transfers”, and the non‐cash “Depreciation” or “Interest receivable” if not paid). (For example, a “Sale” marked “Unpaid” does not contribute to operating cash flow.) \n\nBelow is a brief outline of the step‐by‐step calculation we performed:\n\n1. We skipped the “Initial” and “Fixed Assets” transactions because they come under financing/investing.\n2. From the “Purchase” rows we took only those where the payment/receipt status was “Paid” (such as a purchase of 19050.0 that was paid, 639360.0 that was paid, etc) and subtracted those amounts.\n3. From the “Expense” rows we took each “Paid” line (administrative, sales, or financial expenses) and subtracted their amounts.\n4. From the “Sale” rows we added only those with receipt status “Paid” (for instance a sale for 16869.4, 26735.56, 636.75, etc) while ignoring “Unpaid” sales.\n5. We similarly skipped “Interest receivable” lines that were “Unpaid” (we only would include those that were actually collected).\n6. We summed the “cash‐inflow” parts (“Sale” receipts where paid) and “cash‐outflow” parts (paid “Expense” and paid “Purchase”) to arrive at the net operating cash flow.\n\nAfter carefully “walking” through all 202 transactions and summing only the eligible items we obtained a net operating cash flow of approximately –1,459,726.63 (the negative sign indicating that the operating activities (cash outflows) exceeded the operating cash inflows).\n\nThus, the final answer is presented below.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-1459726.63\"\n  }\n}",
