                        "content": "We can “recover” a calculation of net profit by “picking out” those entries that – roughly – are already “profit‐derived” (the sale rows give you the “profit” amount, that is the difference between the after–tax sale receipt and the cost for the items sold) and then “subtracting” from that operating (and other) income the other operating expense items (the “Expense” rows plus the “Depreciation” items) while “adding” any interest income. (Other “non‐operating” items – purchases, cash or asset entries, transfers – are not included in the profit calculation.)\n\nOne way to think of the calculation is as follows:\n\n1. From every sale record we “collect” the value in its “profit” field. In our table the many “Sale…” rows (for example, a sale with profit 5422.60, another with 9345.05, etc.) add up to approximately 289806.22.\n\n2. Many of the “Expense” records show a monetary “expense” (whether for administrative, sales, or financial expenses) and these are “costs” that reduce profit. Their sum (when added over all Expense rows of type Administrative Expenses, Sales Expenses, and Financial Expenses) comes to about 24761.04.\n\n3. In addition there is a “Depreciation” record – a non–cash operating expense – which is 45751.5 on 2024–01–01 and later (on 2024–02–01) another depreciation of 86352.28. Together these add to about 132103.78.\n\n4. Finally there are several “Interest Receivables” (which represent income even though many are “Unpaid” – they still affect the accrual profit–calculation). Their combined amount is about 5982.85.\n\nThen one “formula” is\n\n  net profit = (sum of sale‐profits) + (sum of interest receivable amounts)\n       – [(sum of expense amounts) + (sum of depreciation amounts)]\n\nPlugging in the numbers computed above we get\n\n  net profit = 289806.22 + 5982.85 – (24761.04 + 132103.78)\n        ≈ 295789.07 – 156864.82\n        ≈ 138924.25\n\nThus the final net profit (as the “net profit” item which will appear in the cash flow statement) is about 138924.25.\n\nBelow is our answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"138924.25\"} }\n``` \n\nNote: Because the original data contains many entries (many “Sale” and “Expense” rows, plus adjusting rows for depreciation and interest) an “exact” result may depend on the treatment (for example, which items count in operational income vs. investment or financing items). Here we treat the “profit” numbers in the sale rows as gross operating profit that must have the sum of the “Expense” (administrative, sales, financial) plus depreciation subtracted – and then we add the “Interest receivable” amounts – to arrive at the net profit.",
