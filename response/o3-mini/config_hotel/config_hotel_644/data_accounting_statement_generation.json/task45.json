                        "content": "We must include only those cash‐flow transactions that reflect actual cash paid (or received) for “investing” items. In our data the only “investing” transactions are those in which fixed assets are bought. (The “Initial” entries show the wallet opening balances but are not “flow” transactions, and many “Purchase” types refer to inventory items or services.) In our table there are several transactions whose type is “Fixed Assets Purchase” – these are the cash outflows related to investing (the acquisition of long‐term assets).\n\nIn our file we locate these “Fixed Assets Purchase” rows (ignoring the “Initial … Fixed Assets” row because that is the book‐entry opening balance):\n\n1. \n  FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | amount = 455144.64  \n  (asset “Elevator System4”, type “Elevator System”)  \n2. \n  FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | amount = 374964.45  \n  (asset “Renovation Project6”, type “Renovation Project”)  \n3. \n  FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | amount = 1495645.8  \n  (asset “Renovation Project6”, type “Renovation Project”)  \n4. \n  FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | amount = 625338.59  \n  (asset “Elevator System7”, type “Elevator System”)  \n5. \n  FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | amount = 464570.86  \n  (asset “Kitchen Equipment8”, type “Kitchen Equipment”)\n\nNow we sum the cash amounts that were paid for these investments:\n\n  Total outflow = 455144.64 + 374964.45 = 830109.09  \n  Then 830109.09 + 1495645.8 = 2325754.89  \n  Then 2325754.89 + 625338.59 = 2951093.48  \n  Finally, 2951093.48 + 464570.86 = 3415664.34\n\nSince these are cash outflows (money paid to acquire fixed assets), the net cash flow from investing activities is negative. Therefore,\n\n  Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = –3415664.34\n\nWe now present the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\nFinal answer:\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-3415664.34\"} }",
