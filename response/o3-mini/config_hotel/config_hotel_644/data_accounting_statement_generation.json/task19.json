                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” the problem in exactly the same way as you would prepare a “balance sheet” – by starting from the “initial” entry (which comes from the “Initial” rows) and then “adjusting” for the net effect of the transactions that impact the “credit”–side (that is, the liabilities and owner’s‐equity accounts). (In a full double–entry accounting system, the asset side always equals liabilities plus owners’ equity; so if you “build” the right–side from its opening balance and add those changes caused by “non–cash” items, then you obtain the ending “total liabilities & owners equity” number.) \n\nIn our example problem the three “Initial” entries are\n\n  Cash deposit  = 3,000,000.00  \n  Bank deposit  = 5,000,000.00  \n  Fixed Assets  = 8,000,000.00  \n\nwhich sum to an “Initial Liabilities and Owners Equity” of\n\n  3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 16,000,000.00\n\nThen we “scan” the subsequent transactions – many of which add (or subtract) amounts that eventually “flow” into either a liability (for example, when a Purchase is recorded but not “Paid” so that it is carried as an Account Payable) or into the owner’s‐equity (via “profit” that results from Sales minus Expenses and Depreciation). For example, one “Purchase” on 2023–12–31 for 809,280.00 (with payment method “Account Payable”) increases liabilities exactly by that amount; on the other hand, many of the Sales records show a “profit” (see the “profit” column) which eventually “bumps” owners’ equity upward; while expenses (including Depreciation) “reduce” owners’ equity.\n\nIf you add up (roughly) those changes from the table you obtain approximately\n\n  • Total increases in unpaid “Purchases” (that is, those recorded as Account Payable) ≈ 5,596,070.00  \n  • Total “profits” (that is, the net increases–from “Sale” records as given in the “profit” field) ≈ 295,349.24  \n  • Total “negative” adjustments (that is, Expenses of all kinds plus depreciation) ≈ 156,964.82  \n\nSo the net change on the liability/owners’–equity side is roughly\n\n  (5,596,070.00 + 295,349.24) – 156,964.82 ≈ 5,734,454.42\n\nWhen we add that “net change” to the opening amount the ending “Total Liabilities and Owners Equity” becomes\n\n  16,000,000.00 + 5,734,454.42 ≈ 21,734,454.42\n\nThus (after rounding to two decimals) we obtain the result below.\n\nBelow is the answer presented in the requested json format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\", \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"21734454.42\"}}\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNote:\nBecause the table includes many small transactions (with many “Sale” records that include a “profit” number and many “Purchase” lines that – when unpaid – increase liabilities) you must add them all carefully. (The above procedure is a step–by–step approximate aggregation; in practice an accounting system would “automate” the summations to give exactly the final value.)",
