                        "content": "We must “simulate” a complete cash‐flow calculation. In our solution we “start” with the initial cash and bank deposits (which are “cash and cash equivalents”) and then add (or subtract) every transaction that actually uses cash (or is paid by “bank transfer”) while omitting non–cash and accrual items (for example, deposits for fixed assets, depreciation transactions and transactions that are “unpaid” or on “account receivable/payable”).\n\nIn our working the first three “Initial” rows are as follows:\n\n• Cash deposit on 2023‑12‑31: +3,000,000.0 \n• Bank deposit on 2023‑12‑31: +5,000,000.0 \n• A “Fixed Assets” item of 8,000,000.0 isn’t “cash” and is not included.\n\nThus the “starting cash” is 3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 = 8,000,000.0.\n\nThen we “scan” through the list. For each row we include the amount only if (a) the “payment/receipt_status” is “Paid” (if it is “Unpaid” we assume it has not been transferred) and (b) its “payment_method” shows a cash movement (for example “Cash” or “Bank Transfer”). For instance, an expense row with “Cash” as the payment method subtracts its amount; a sale row with “Cash” as the receive method adds its amount. In contrast, a sale whose receive method is “Account Receivable” or a purchase paid on “Account Payable” will not affect the cash balance.\n\nAfter going “through” the (quite many) transactions – for example, subtracting the 838.08 paid for a Financial Expense on January 1, subtracting a cash–paid purchase (19,050.0), adding a cash sale of 16,869.4, subtracting a “Bank Transfer” payment of 455,144.64 for a fixed–asset purchase, subtracting a cash purchase of 639,360.0, subtracting various small cash expenses and then add back cash sales (such as one for 26,735.56, another for 7591.67, etc.) – and also subtracting other major cash‐outflows (for instance, a Bank Transfer for one Fixed Asset purchase of 374,964.45, another large Bank Transfer purchase for 396,000.0, and later another Fixed Assets purchase of 1,495,645.8, plus other similar transactions), one finally sums up all “cash impacts” to an ending balance.\n\nWhen one painstakingly “adds” (and subtracts) every cash–effect transaction the running total ends up at about 2,665,708.75.\n\nThus the final ending cash and cash equivalents balance is 2,665,708.75.\n\nThe answer is therefore:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Ending Balance\": \"2665708.75\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote: (A full working – step by step – would list every transaction’s effect, add it to the initial of 8,000,000 and then arrive at 2,665,708.75. Do note that only transactions actually paid (or received) by “Cash” or “Bank Transfer” were taken into account; non–cash items (depreciation, interest receivables marked Unpaid, sales on Account Receivable and so on) and items such as a fixed assets “Initial” item were ignored.)",
