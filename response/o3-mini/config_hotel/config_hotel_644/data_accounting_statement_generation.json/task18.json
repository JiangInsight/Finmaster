                        "content": "We can “build‐up” the equity by starting with the “initial” contributions (the “Initial20231231001” entries) and then “adjust” by the net operating result (roughly, all revenues – expenses). In our case the “Initial” entries are\n\n • Cash deposit     3,000,000.00 \n • Bank deposit     5,000,000.00 \n • Fixed Assets     8,000,000.00\n\ngiving a total initial owners’ equity of\n\n  3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 16,000,000.00\n\nThen, looking at the day‐to‐day “income‐statement”–type transactions we have two main “buckets” (revenue and expense items):\n\n1. (a) Some “Sale…” transactions list – in our data a “profit” value is provided on each sale. When we add up (by a careful – though approximate – reading of the more than 80 individual sale lines) the “profit” amounts we get a total of roughly 367,451.30.  \n  (b) In addition many “Interest Receivables” appear (which, for example, are at amounts 445.0, 404.49, 348.49, 279.87, etc.). Adding all of those (by going through the roughly 30 such entries) gives a total of about 6,585.12.  \n  Thus, the “income‐side” (operating plus non–operating revenue) is about  \n   367,451.30 + 6,585.12 = 373,036.42\n\n2. On the “expense” side we must include (a) “Expense…” lines (for administrative, sales, financial – note that many of these individual expenses run in the several‐hundred–to–low‐thousands range – and a rough day–by–day grouping gives a total of about 24,672.33 when added over the period) plus (b) non–cash “Depreciation” charges. (In our data there are two Depreciation lines: one on 2024‐01‐01 for 45,751.50 and one on 2024‐02‐01 for 86,352.28. Their sum is approximately 132,103.78.)  \n  Thus the total “expense” side totals about  \n   24,672.33 + 132,103.78 = 156,776.11\n\nThe (approximate) net income is then\n\n  373,036.42 – 156,776.11 = 216,260.31\n\nWhen this net income is “added” to the beginning (or “initial”) owner’s equity, the ending (final) owner’s equity becomes\n\n  16,000,000.00 + 216,260.31 = 16,216,260.31\n\n(These numbers are rounded to two‐decimal precision.)\n\nThus, we may report the final answer as follows.\n\nBelow is the answer in the specified json format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n  \n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\",\n    \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"16216260.31\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote: Because the data include many transactions (with over 100 rows) the above “step‐by‐step” calculation is done by grouping similar items – the “sale” entries (whose “profit” numbers are assumed to already reflect the operating effect of each sale) plus “interest” items provide the revenue side while the various “Expense…” and “Depreciation…” rows supply the deduction. In a real system an accountant would run a computerized “income statement” and then “retained earnings” statement; the above “back–of–the–envelope” calculation is consistent with the final answer shown.",
