                        "content": "We need to “build” the balance‐sheet fixed assets value from the “initial” fixed asset book value (set at the start by the “Initial” row) plus any subsequent “Fixed Assets Purchase” entries. (For the purposes of this exercise we ignore entries that affect depreciation or expense accounts – even though depreciation is recorded, it is not “netted” in this report.) \n\nStep 1. Find the “Initial” fixed assets entry. In our table the row with type “Fixed Assets” (from the Initial20231231001 batch) shows:\n  Initial Fixed Assets = 8,000,000.00\n\nStep 2. Identify all rows that add fixed assets via “Fixed Assets Purchase.” In our table these “FixedAsset20231231001” rows (the “type” column shows “Fixed Assets Purchase”) and their amounts are:\n  • 455,144.64    (Elevator System4)\n  • 374,964.45    (Kitchen Equipment5)\n  • 1,495,645.80   (Renovation Project6)\n  • 625,338.59    (Elevator System7)\n  • 464,570.86    (Kitchen Equipment8)\n\nNow sum these fixed asset purchases:\n  455,144.64 + 374,964.45 = 830,109.09  \n  830,109.09 + 1,495,645.80 = 2,325,754.89  \n  2,325,754.89 + 625,338.59 = 2,951,093.48  \n  2,951,093.48 + 464,570.86 = 3,415,664.34\n\nStep 3. The “end–of–period” fixed asset value is the initial value plus the sum of all additional fixed asset purchases:\n  8,000,000.00 + 3,415,664.34 = 11,415,664.34\n\n(Notice that while depreciation transactions are recorded in the table, the example solution did not subtract those amounts from the “fixed assets item” on the balance sheet. Presumably depreciation is reported elsewhere (accumulated depreciation) and the “fixed assets” figure here is maintained at its original cost.)\n\nThus, our answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"11415664.34\"\n  }\n}",
