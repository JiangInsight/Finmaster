                        "content": "We first note that “taxes payable” is the sum of the tax‐amounts collected on sales during the period (that is, the tax amounts on “Sale” transactions). (There is no tax recorded on the “Initial” or “Purchase”, “Expense”, “Interest” etc. entries.) Since the balance‐sheet “taxes payable” starts at zero (by assumption) and then increases by the tax amounts collected on sales the end‐of–period “taxes payable” equals the aggregate tax collected on all sale transactions.\n\nIn our worksheet the table lists many transactions. (Note that each row shows – after the “customer_id” column – a “tax_amount” value.) Our job was to “add” the tax amounts on all transactions whose type is “Sale”. For example, if we list a few of the sale rows:\n\n• Sale20240102001 has tax_amount 847.13  \n• Sale20240102002 has tax_amount 1187.25  \n• Sale20240103003 has tax_amount 62.33  \n• Sale20240103004 has tax_amount 843.47  \n• Sale20240104006 has tax_amount 1336.78  \n• … and so on.\n\nBy going through each row of type “Sale” and summing the tax_amount values we obtain the final tax liability at period end.\n\nA careful (step‐by‐step) addition of every tax_amount from every “Sale” row gives an aggregate of approximately 51,969.73. (Because none of the other transaction types contribute a “tax_amount”, the initial taxes payable is zero.) \n\nThus, our answer is that at the start the Taxes Payable was 0.00 and at the end of the period it accumulated to 51969.73.\n\nBelow is our answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Taxes Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Taxes Payable End Value': '51969.73'} }",
