In these records there are two such entries:\n\n• On 2024‑01‑01 the company recorded a depreciation expense of 45,751.5.  \n• Then on 2024‑02‑01 a further depreciation expense of 86,352.28 was recorded.\n\nAssuming that no depreciation had been accumulated before (that is, the “Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value” is zero) the “Accumulated Depreciation End Value” is the sum of the two depreciation amounts:\n\n  45,751.5 + 86,352.28 = 132,103.78\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"132103.78\"\n  }\n}",
