                        "content": "We must determine the net change in the accounts payable balance. In our “normal‐running” business the only transactions that affect accounts payable are those “Purchase” transactions that are recorded as “Unpaid” (and recorded with the “Account Payable” payment method) when the supplier “credit” is established. (If a purchase is “Paid” using cash or bank transfer it already “settles” the payable so it does not contribute to the ending accounts payable balance.) \n\nIn the provided data we scan through all transactions and, by inspection, only the following “Purchase” rows have payment_method “Account Payable” (and status “Unpaid”) and therefore add to accounts payable:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001 – amount = 809280.00  \n2. Purchase20231231002 – amount = 19650.00  \n3. Purchase20231231005 – amount = 44850.00  \n4. Purchase20231231006 – amount = 605000.00  \n5. Purchase20231231007 – amount = 75250.00  \n6. Purchase20231231012 – amount = 100800.00  \n7. Purchase20231231013 – amount = 596000.00  \n8. Purchase20231231015 – amount = 1470000.00  \n9. Purchase20231231016 – amount = 700000.00  \n10. Purchase20231231017 – amount = 218240.00  \n11. Purchase20231231018 – amount = 399000.00  \n12. Purchase20231231020 – amount = 558000.00  \n\nNow we add them step‐by‐step:\n\n• 809280.00  \n + 19650.00 = 828930.00  \n + 44850.00 = 873780.00  \n + 605000.00 = 1,478,780.00  \n + 75250.00 = 1,553,030.00  \n + 100800.00 = 1,653,830.00  \n + 596000.00 = 2,249,830.00  \n + 1,470,000.00 = 3,719,830.00  \n + 700,000.00 = 4,419,830.00  \n + 218240.00 = 4,638,070.00  \n + 399000.00 = 5,037,070.00  \n + 558000.00 = 5,595,070.00  \n\nThere do not appear to be any transactions that “settle” (or reduce) these AP amounts (e.g. a “Payment” using an “Account Payable” method); so the net change in accounts payable is an increase of 5,595,070.00.\n\nThus, our final answer for the cash flow item “Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable” is 5,595,070.00.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"5595070.00\"\n  }\n}",
