                        "content": "We start by extracting the needed amounts from the three statements.\n\nStep 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio  \n• From the cash‐flow statement we have the “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities”: –1,919,526.63  \n• From the income statement the “Net Profit” is: 99,532.29  \n• The ratio is computed as:  \n  Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Net Profit)  \n  = –1,919,526.63 / 99,532.29 ≈ –19.28\n\nStep 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio  \nThe sample “turnover ratio” used the Total Revenue divided by the Total Current Assets (at period end).  \n• From the income statement, “Total Revenue” = 836,813.79  \n• From the balance sheet, “Total Current Assets” at end = 10,453,882.43  \n• Thus, the ratio is:  \n  Current Assets Turnover Ratio = 836,813.79 / 10,453,882.43 ≈ 0.08\n\nStep 3. Quick Ratio  \nThe Quick Ratio is calculated as (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Short-term Receivables) divided by (Current Liabilities). Here we add the following quick assets:  \n  Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, and Accounts Receivable.  \n• Quick Assets = 2,105,753.37 + 559,055.66 + 6,494.02 + 335,639.38  \n  = 2,105,753.37 + 559,055.66 = 2,664,809.03  \n  2,664,809.03 + 6,494.02 = 2,671,303.05  \n  2,671,303.05 + 335,639.38 = 3,006,942.43  \n• Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 5,596,070.00 + 41,840.70 = 5,637,910.70  \n• Therefore:  \n  Quick Ratio = 3,006,942.43 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ 0.53\n\nThus, the final answers are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-19.28\",\n    \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.08\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.53\"\n  }\n}",
