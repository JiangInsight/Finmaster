                        "content": "Step 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio \n• Formula: Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities \n• From the cash‐flow statement, Operating Cash Flow = –1,919,526.63 \n• From the balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70 \n• Ratio = –1,919,526.63 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ –0.3406, which rounded to two decimals is –0.34\n\nStep 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio \n• This ratio is defined similarly here as Operating Cash Flow divided by Total Debt – in this context Total Debt is taken as Total Current Liabilities. \n• Thus, it also equals –1,919,526.63 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ –0.34\n\nStep 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio \n• We use the Average Inventory since the beginning balance is 0. \n• Average Inventory = (0 + 7,446,940.00) / 2 = 3,723,470.00 \n• From the income statement, Cost of Goods Sold = 544,970.00 \n• Inventory Turnover = 544,970.00 / 3,723,470.00 ≈ 0.1464, which rounds to 0.15\n\nStep 4. Debt to Equity Ratio \n• Formula: Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity \n• From the balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities (our debt) = 5,637,910.70 \n• Total Owner’s Equity = 16,099,532.29 \n• Ratio = 5,637,910.70 / 16,099,532.29 ≈ 0.350, or 0.35\n\nStep 5. Quick Ratio \n• Formula: Quick Ratio = (Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities \n• Add the quick assets: \n Cash on Hand = 2,105,753.37 \n Bank Deposits = 559,055.66 \n Interest Receivable = 6,494.02 \n Accounts Receivable = 335,639.38 \n• Sum = 2,105,753.37 + 559,055.66 + 6,494.02 + 335,639.38 = 3,006,942.43 \n• Quick Ratio = 3,006,942.43 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ 0.5338, which is about 0.53\n\nStep 6. Current Ratio \n• Formula: Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities \n• From the balance sheet, Total Current Assets = 10,453,882.43 \n• Total Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70 \n• Ratio = 10,453,882.43 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ 1.854, or 1.85\n\nThus, the final results in the required format are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.34\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.34\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"0.15\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.35\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.53\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"1.85\"\n  }\n}",
