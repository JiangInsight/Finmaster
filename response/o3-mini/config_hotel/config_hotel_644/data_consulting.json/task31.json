                        "content": "We can derive the five ratios by reading the statements and then using the following standard formulas:\n\n1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n  • In our case the initial Accounts Receivable is 0 and the ending value is 335639.38 so the average equals (0 + 335639.38) / 2 = 167819.69.  \n  • Revenue is taken from the income statement “Main Business Revenue” = 836813.79.  \n  • Therefore, AR Turnover = 836813.79 / 167819.69 ≈ 4.99.\n\n2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio (or Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio) = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n  • Here the “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities” from the cash flow statement is –1919526.63.  \n  • The Total Current Liabilities on the balance sheet are 5637910.70.  \n  • So the ratio = –1919526.63 / 5637910.70 ≈ –0.34.  \n  • (Since the sample problem showed the same number for both “operating cash flow ratio” and “operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio”, we fill in the same value for both.)\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Average Total Assets  \n  • The beginning Total Assets is 16000000.00 and the ending Total Assets is 21737442.99 so the average is (16000000.00 + 21737442.99) / 2 = 18868721.495.  \n  • Thus, Total Asset Turnover = 836813.79 / 18868721.495 ≈ 0.0444; when rounded, about 0.04.\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity  \n  • In our balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities (which serve as total liabilities) are 5637910.70 and Total Owner's Equity is 16099532.29.  \n  • Debt to Equity = 5637910.70 / 16099532.29 ≈ 0.35.\n\nThus, the results are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"4.99\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-0.34\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.34\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.04\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.35\"\n  }\n}",
