In the Balance Sheet the only provided liability is the Total Current Liabilities of 5,637,910.70.\n• Owner’s Equity is given as 16,099,532.29.\n• Debt to Equity Ratio = Debt ÷ Owner’s Equity = 5,637,910.70 ÷ 16,099,532.29 ≈ 0.35.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Net Profit Margin.\n• From the Income Statement, the Net Profit is 99,532.29 and the Total Revenue is 836,813.79.\n• Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit ÷ Total Revenue) × 100 = (99,532.29 ÷ 836,813.79) × 100 ≈ 11.89%.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n• From the Cash Flow Statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is –1,919,526.63.\n• The Total Current Liabilities (from the Balance Sheet) are 5,637,910.70.\n• Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = –1,919,526.63 ÷ 5,637,910.70 ≈ –0.34.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.35\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"11.89%\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.34\"\n  }\n}",
