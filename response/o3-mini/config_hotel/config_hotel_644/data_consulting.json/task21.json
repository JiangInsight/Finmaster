                        "content": "We can solve the problem in two parts.\n\n1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n\nFrom the cash‐flow statement the FCF is calculated as the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities less the capital expenditure (i.e. Purchase of Fixed Assets). In our case this works as follows:\n  • Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –1,919,526.63 \n  • Purchase of Fixed Assets = 3,415,664.34  \nThus, FCF = –1,919,526.63 – 3,415,664.34 = –5,335,190.97\n\n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\nThis ratio is calculated as Total Revenue divided by the average current assets over the period. The average current assets are computed using the beginning and ending total current assets from the balance sheet.\n  • Beginning Total Current Assets = 8,000,000.00 \n  • Ending Total Current Assets = 10,453,882.43 \nAverage Current Assets = (8,000,000.00 + 10,453,882.43) / 2 = 9,226,941.215\n  • Total Revenue (from income statement) = 836,813.79 \nThen, the Current Assets Turnover Ratio = 836,813.79 / 9,226,941.215 ≈ 0.0907 (≈ 0.09)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-5335190.97\",\n    \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.09\"\n  }\n}",
