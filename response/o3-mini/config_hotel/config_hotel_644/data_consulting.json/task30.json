                        "content": "We need to extract and use the relevant numbers from the provided statements. The relevant items (end amounts) are as follows:\n\n1. From the balance sheet:\n • Current Assets = 10,453,882.43  \n • Inventory = 7,446,940.00  \n • Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70  \n • Total Assets = 21,737,442.99  \n • Total Owner’s Equity = 16,099,532.29  \n • (No other liabilities are provided so we assume the “Total Current Liabilities” represent total debt.)\n\n2. From the cash flow statement:\n • Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –1,919,526.63\n\n3. From the income statement (used only for net profit confirmation; here net profit is 99,532.29). However, the ratios below are computed only using the balance sheet and cash flow figures.\n\nNow calculate each ratio step by step:\n\n──────────────────────────\nStep 1. Current Ratio  \nFormula: Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nCalculation:  \n= 10,453,882.43 / 5,637,910.70  \n≈ 1.853 (rounded to two decimals gives 1.85)\n\n──────────────────────────\nStep 2. Quick Ratio  \nFormula: Quick Ratio = (Current Assets – Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nCalculation:  \nFirst, subtract Inventory from Current Assets:  \n10,453,882.43 – 7,446,940.00 = 3,006,942.43  \n\nThen, divide this by Current Liabilities:  \n= 3,006,942.43 / 5,637,910.70  \n≈ 0.533 (rounded to two decimals gives 0.53)\n\n──────────────────────────\nStep 3. Debt to Asset Ratio  \nFormula: Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets  \n(Here, Total Liabilities is the current liabilities.)\n\nCalculation:  \n= 5,637,910.70 / 21,737,442.99  \n≈ 0.259 (rounded to two decimals gives 0.26)\n\n──────────────────────────\nStep 4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \nFormula: Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity\n\nCalculation:  \n= 5,637,910.70 / 16,099,532.29  \n≈ 0.350 (rounded to two decimals gives 0.35)\n\n──────────────────────────\nStep 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \nFormula: Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt\n\nCalculation:  \n= –1,919,526.63 / 5,637,910.70  \n≈ –0.340 (rounded to two decimals gives –0.34)\n\n──────────────────────────\nThus, the five ratios are:\n\n• Current Ratio = 1.85  \n• Quick Ratio = 0.53  \n• Debt to Asset Ratio = 0.26  \n• Debt to Equity Ratio = 0.35  \n• Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = –0.34\n\nNow we present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"1.85\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.53\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.26\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.35\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.34\"\n  }\n}",
