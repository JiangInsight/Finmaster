                        "content": "First, we need to derive each metric from the provided financial statements.\n\n1. Return on Equity (ROE)\n\nROE is calculated using the net profit relative to the average owner’s equity. Use the average of the beginning and ending owner’s equity amounts.\n\n• From the balance sheet:\n – Beginning Owner’s Equity (2023-12-31): 16,000,000.00  \n – Ending Owner’s Equity (2024-02-01): 16,099,532.29  \n\nCalculate the average owner’s equity:\n Average Owner’s Equity = (16,000,000.00 + 16,099,532.29) / 2  \n                 = 32,099,532.29 / 2  \n                 ≈ 16,049,766.15\n\n• From the income statement, the Net Profit is: 99,532.29\n\nThus, ROE = (Net Profit / Average Owner’s Equity) × 100  \n    = (99,532.29 / 16,049,766.15) × 100  \n    ≈ 0.6203%  \nRounded, we get ROE ≈ 0.62%\n\n2. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\nThis ratio is Total Liabilities divided by Total Assets.\n\n• From the balance sheet:\n – Total Liabilities: We sum Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable:\n  Accounts Payable: 5,596,070.00  \n  Taxes Payable: 41,840.70  \n  Total Liabilities = 5,596,070.00 + 41,840.70 = 5,637,910.70\n\n – Total Assets (Ending): 21,737,442.99\n\nThus, Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets  \n     = 5,637,910.70 / 21,737,442.99  \n     ≈ 0.2593  \nRounded, we express it as ≈ 0.26\n\n3. Gross Profit Margin\n\nGross Profit Margin is calculated as Gross Profit divided by Total Revenue, then multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n\n• From the income statement:\n – Gross Profit: 291,843.79  \n – Total Revenue: 836,813.79\n\nThus, Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100  \n     = (291,843.79 / 836,813.79) × 100  \n     ≈ 34.88%\n\nThus, the answers are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"0.62%\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.26\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"34.88%\"\n  }\n}",
