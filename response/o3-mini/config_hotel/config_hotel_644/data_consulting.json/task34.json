                        "content": "We start by gathering the ending (latest) numbers from each of the three statements.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Extract the key amounts (all “End_amount” values):\n\n• From the Balance Sheet:\n – Cash on Hand = 2,105,753.37  \n – Bank Deposits = 559,055.66  \n – Interest Receivable = 6,494.02  \n – Accounts Receivable = 335,639.38  \n – Inventory = 7,446,940.00  \n – Total Current Assets = 10,453,882.43  \n – Fixed Assets = 11,415,664.34  \n – Accumulated Depreciation = 132,103.78  \n – Total Non-current Assets = 11,283,560.56  \n – Total Assets = 21,737,442.99  \n – Accounts Payable = 5,596,070.00  \n – Taxes Payable = 41,840.70  \n – Total Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70  \n – Paid-in Capital = 16,000,000.00  \n – Retained Earnings = 99,532.29  \n – Total Owner’s Equity = 16,099,532.29\n\nThe total liabilities can be deduced as:  \n Total Liabilities = Total Assets – Owner’s Equity  \n  = 21,737,442.99 – 16,099,532.29  \n  = 5,637,910.70  \n(which matches the given Total Current Liabilities, assuming no non–current debt)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Extract numbers from the Cash Flow Statement:\n – Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –1,919,526.63  \n (The other operating items add up to this value.)  \n – Depreciation (for reference in some ratios) = 132,103.78\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Extract numbers from the Income Statement:\n – Total Revenue = 836,813.79  \n – Cost of Goods Sold = 544,970.00  \n – Net Profit = 99,532.29\n\n──────────────────────────────\nNow compute each ratio:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n Definition: (Operating Cash Flow) ÷ (Current Liabilities)  \n Calculation: –1,919,526.63 ÷ 5,637,910.70 ≈ –0.34\n\n2. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n Definition: (Total Liabilities) ÷ (Owner’s Equity)  \n Calculation: 5,637,910.70 ÷ 16,099,532.29 ≈ 0.35\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n Definition: (Total Revenue) ÷ (Total Assets)  \n Calculation: 836,813.79 ÷ 21,737,442.99 ≈ 0.0385  \n Rounded to two decimals: 0.04\n\n4. Quick Ratio  \n Definition: (Cash + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable) ÷ (Current Liabilities)  \n First compute the numerator:  \n  Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits = 2,105,753.37 + 559,055.66 = 2,664,809.03  \n  Add Accounts Receivable: 2,664,809.03 + 335,639.38 = 2,1? 2,664,809.03 + 335,639.38 = 3,000,448.41  \n  Add Interest Receivable: 3,000,448.41 + 6,494.02 = 3,006,942.43  \n Then, Quick Ratio = 3,006,942.43 ÷ 5,637,910.70 ≈ 0.533, i.e. about 0.53\n\n5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n Definition: Often the same as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n Calculation: –1,919,526.63 ÷ 5,637,910.70 ≈ –0.34\n\n6. Return on Equity (ROE)  \n Definition: (Net Profit) ÷ (Owner’s Equity)  \n Calculation: 99,532.29 ÷ 16,099,532.29 ≈ 0.00618  \n Expressed as a percentage: 0.62%\n\n7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n Definition: (Total Revenue) ÷ (Accounts Receivable)  \n Calculation: 836,813.79 ÷ 335,639.38 ≈ 2.49\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThus, the calculated ratios are:\n\n• Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: –0.34  \n• Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.35  \n• Total Asset Turnover Ratio: 0.04  \n• Quick Ratio: 0.53  \n• Operating Cash Flow Ratio: –0.34  \n• Return on Equity (ROE): 0.62%  \n• Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: 2.49\n\n──────────────────────────────\nNow we provide the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.34\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.35\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.04\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.53\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.34\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"0.62%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.49\"\n  }\n}",
