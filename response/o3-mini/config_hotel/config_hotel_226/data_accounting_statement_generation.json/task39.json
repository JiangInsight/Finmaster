                        "content": "We need first to find out the net change in interest receivable during the period. (In the statement of cash flows an increase in a receivable is a use of cash and is shown as a negative number.) In our “Problem to Solve” the only transactions that affect the “Interest Receivables” account are those with type “Interest Receivables.” (They are all “Unpaid” so no cash has come in for them.) Our job is to add their amounts and then “flip” the sign to show the cash‐flow effect.\n\nBelow are the “Interest Receivables” rows (the id starts with Interest) with their amount values:\n\n1. Interest20240101001: 445.0  \n2. Interest20240102002: 445.0  \n3. Interest20240103003: 445.0  \n4. Interest20240104004: 445.0  \n5. Interest20240105005: 445.0  \n6. Interest20240106006: 445.0  \n7. Interest20240107007: 445.0  \n8. Interest20240108008: 445.0  \n9. Interest20240109009: 441.93  \n10. Interest20240110010: 441.93  \n11. Interest20240111011: 368.02  \n12. Interest20240112012: 368.02  \n13. Interest20240113013: 368.02  \n14. Interest20240114014: 368.02  \n15. Interest20240115015: 368.02  \n16. Interest20240116016: 368.02  \n17. Interest20240117017: 368.02  \n18. Interest20240118018: 368.02  \n19. Interest20240119019: 368.02  \n20. Interest20240120020: 368.02  \n21. Interest20240121021: 368.02  \n22.

Interest20240127027: 368.02  \n28. Interest20240128028: 368.02  \n29. Interest20240129029: 333.94  \n30. Interest20240130030: 333.94  \n31. Interest20240131031: 333.94  \n32. Interest20240201032: 333.94  \n33. Interest20240202033: 333.94  \n\n(Here numbers such as 368.02338825 or 333.9353692 have been rounded to two‐decimal places for clarity.)\n\nNow, step‐by‐step add these amounts:\n\n• There are 8 entries of 445.00 which sum to:  \n  8 × 445.00 = 3560.00\n\n• Next, the two 441.93’s:  \n  2 × 441.93 ≈ 883.86\n\nSo the subtotal for rows 1–10 is:  \n  3560.00 + 883.86 = 4443.86\n\n• Then, from row 11 through row 28 there are 18 entries of about 368.02 each. Their total is:  \n  18 × 368.02 ≈ 6624.36  \n  Adding the previous subtotal gives: 4443.86 + 6624.36 = 11068.22\n\n• Finally, rows 29–33 are five entries of about 333.94 each:  \n  5 × 333.94 ≈ 1669.70  \n  Total sum = 11068.22 + 1669.70 ≈ 12737.92\n\n(To be precise our sum comes out approximately 12737.96.) \n\nSince all these interest receivable entries have increased (none of them “reverse” as a cash receipt), the interest receivable account increased by roughly 12737.96 in this period. In the operating activities section of the cash flow statement an increase in a receivable is shown as a use of cash; that is, it is subtracted (a “decrease” in cash available from operations).\n\nThus the item “(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable” is –12737.96.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-12737.96\"\n  }\n}\n-------------------------------------------------",
