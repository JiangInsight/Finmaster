                        "content": "We “build” the non‐current asset balance by starting with the “Fixed Assets” on the initial day and then adding any fixed asset acquisitions (that show up as “Fixed Assets Purchase”) while subtracting the depreciation expense recorded against those assets. In the sample data below only the following transactions affect the fixed (non‐current) assets:\n\n1. The initial fixed assets recorded at 2023‑12‑31 is:\n  • \"Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets\": 8,000,000.00\n\n2. Then an acquisition is recorded as:\n  • \"FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase\": 383,011.45\n\n3. Depreciation is recorded on two days:\n  • \"Depreciation20240101001\": 45,745.80 \n  • \"Depreciation20240201002\": 69,766.11  \n  The total depreciation is: 45,745.80 + 69,766.11 = 115,511.91\n\nThus, the ending non‐current assets balance is computed as:\n  End Value = Initial Fixed Assets + Fixed asset additions − Total Depreciation  \n    = 8,000,000.00 + 383,011.45 − 115,511.91  \n    = 8,383,011.45 − 115,511.91  \n    ≈ 8,267,499.54\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n────────────────────────────\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '8267499.54'}}\n────────────────────────────\n\nNote:\n• Only those entries labeled as “Fixed Assets” (or “Fixed Assets Purchase”) have been included.\n• Sales, Purchases of items like “Quick Meal Set” and similar products are considered operating (current) inventory and do not affect the fixed asset amount.\n• Depreciation reduces the carrying amount of the fixed assets, therefore it is subtracted from the sum of the initial value and any additions.",
