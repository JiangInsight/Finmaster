Two of these indicate “Cash deposit” and “Bank deposit” with amounts of 3,000,000 and 5,000,000 respectively, while the third is “Fixed Assets” with 8,000,000. In a cash flow statement the “cash and cash equivalents” normally include cash in hand and bank deposits. Fixed assets (equipment, property, etc.) are not considered cash equivalents. \n\nThus, the beginning cash and cash equivalents balance is the sum of the Cash deposit and Bank deposit:\n  3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000\n\nAll other transactions in the list represent operational changes during the period and do not affect the starting (or beginning) cash balance.\n\nSo the final answer is 8,000,000.00.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\"}}",
