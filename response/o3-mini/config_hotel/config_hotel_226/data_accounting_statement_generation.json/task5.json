                        "content": "We need to “build” the interest‐receivable item based on the balance‐sheet “Interest Receivables” postings. In our data no “Initial…” transaction carries an interest receivable (the three “Initial20231231001” rows set up cash, bank and fixed assets only), so the beginning balance for interest receivables is zero.\n\nThen, every transaction whose type is “Interest Receivables” contributes (with its “amount”) to the ending “Interest Receivable” (its balance “at period‐end”). Scanning the table we see many “Interest Receivables” lines – one each day from 2024‑01‑01 until 2024‑02‑02. (A quick count shows that from 1/1–1/8 there are eight records at 445.0; two records on 1/9 and 1/10 are about 441.93; then from 1/11 until 1/28 there are 18 records at approximately 368.02338825 each; and finally 5 records from 1/29 to 2/02 at 333.9353692.) \n\nCalculating step‐by‐step:\n\n1. From 2024‑01‑01 to 2024‑01‑08 (8 transactions at 445.0):\n  8 × 445.0 = 3,560.0\n\n2. 2024‑01‑09 and 2024‑01‑10 (2 transactions at about 441.93 each):\n  2 × 441.93 ≈ 883.86\n\n3. From 2024‑01‑11 through 2024‑01‑28 (18 transactions at 368.02338825 each):\n  18 × 368.02338825 ≈ 6,624.42\n\n4. From 2024‑01‑29 through 2024‑02‑02 (5 transactions at 333.9353692 each):\n  5 × 333.9353692 ≈ 1,669.68\n\nNow sum all parts:\n  3,560.0 + 883.86 = 4,443.86  \n  4,443.86 + 6,624.42 = 11,068.28  \n  11,068.28 + 1,669.68 = 12,737.96\n\nThus the final (ending) “Interest Receivable” amount is approximately 12,737.96.\n\nSince no beginning (initial) interest receivable is recorded, we get:\n\n• Interest Receivable Initial Value = 0.00  \n• Interest Receivable End Value = 12,737.96\n\nThe final answer in the required json format is as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"12737.96\"\n  }\n}\n\n-----------------------------------------------",
