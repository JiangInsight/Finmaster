                        "content": "We need to “roll‐up” the fixed assets lines from the beginning of the period plus any fixed asset increases (usually recorded with a type “Fixed Assets Purchase”) and then “offset” these by any depreciation transactions.\n\nStep 1. Identify the “initial” fixed assets value. In the list you can note the three “Initial…” lines. Only one of those is for fixed assets. Inspecting the first three rows we have:\n\n• Cash deposit    3000000.0  \n• Bank deposit    5000000.0  \n• Fixed Assets    8000000.0  \n\nThus the reported beginning fixed assets (the “initial” amount) is 8,000,000.00.\n\nStep 2. Add any asset purchases that add to fixed assets. In this transaction list two “Fixed Assets Purchase” records appear. (They are distinguished by their “type”.)\n\nThe first fixed asset purchase is recorded as:  \n \"FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase\" with an amount 830405.75  \n– and its asset name is “Central AC4” with asset type “Central AC”\n\nThe second fixed asset purchase is:  \n \"FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase\" with an amount 383011.45  \n– with asset name “Kitchen Equipment5” and asset type “Kitchen Equipment”\n\nThus the total additions to fixed assets are:  \n 830405.75 + 383011.45 = 1,213,417.20\n\nStep 3. Determine the gross “end‐of–period” fixed assets (before depreciation) by adding the additions to the initial fixed assets:\n 8,000,000.00 + 1,213,417.20 = 9,213,417.20\n\nStep 4. Next include depreciation which reduces the net fixed assets. In this list we see two “Depreciation” transactions:\n• Depreciation20240101001 with amount 45745.8  \n• Depreciation20240201002 with amount 69766.11  \n\nTheir sum equals:  \n 45,745.8 + 69,766.11 = 115,511.91\n\nStep 5. To arrive at the net “end‐of–period” fixed asset value, subtract the total depreciation from the gross assets:\n 9,213,417.20 – 115,511.91 = 9,097,905.29\n\nStep 6. Reporting the answer (rounded to 2 decimal places):\n\n{\n  \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n  \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"9097905.29\"\n}\n\nThus the final solution is as follows.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"9097905.29\"\n  }\n}",
