In our list there are two records where the type is \"Financial Expenses\":\n\n1. The record with id “Expense20240122001” has an amount of 238.17.\n2. The record with id “Expense20240201001” has an amount of 200.69.\n\nThus the final “Financial Expenses” equals the sum: 238.17 + 200.69 = 438.86.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Financial Expenses\": \"438.86\"\n  }\n}",
