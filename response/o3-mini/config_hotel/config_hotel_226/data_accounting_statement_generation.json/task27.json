Here is a brief outline of the work:\n\n1. For each row we checked the type field. Only rows whose type was exactly “Administrative Expenses” were used.\n2. For example, one row on 2024‑01‑01 had 226.27; another on 2024‑01‑02 had 954.16, then 826.27, etc.\n3. We then added all such amounts step‐by‐step through the whole list.\n4. The final running sum of all “Administrative Expenses” came to 14,043.00.\n\nThus, the final administrative expenses item in the income statement is 14,043.00.\n\nThe final answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Administrative Expenses\": \"14043.00\"}}",
