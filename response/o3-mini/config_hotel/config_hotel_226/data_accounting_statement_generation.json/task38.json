                        "content": "We must “build” the receivables balance based on the transactions whose “receive_method” is not “Cash” but indicates that the revenue was “on account” (that is, recorded as an accounts receivable). In our data the sales with receive_method equal to “Account Receviable” (note the spelling) are the ones that will increase the receivables. (No collections or write‐offs are given.) With no beginning balance (since the initial entries show only cash, bank and fixed assets), the ending AR balance equals the sum of all such credit sales. \n\nStep‐by‐step we scan the “Sale…” rows which use “Account Receviable” as their receive method. For example, we find:\n • Sale20240104006 – amount 2,658.43\n • Sale20240104007 – amount 22,421.80\n • Sale20240105011 – amount 4,571.54\n • Sale20240105013 – amount 203.29\n • Sale20240106017 – amount 1,717.11\n • Sale20240106018 – amount 2,301.85\n • Sale20240107019 – amount 1,960.04\n • Sale20240111036 – amount 960.30\n • Sale20240112038 – amount 581.85\n • Sale20240112039 – amount 19,786.05\n • Sale20240113041 – amount 20,956.55\n • Sale20240113042 – amount 11,707.29\n • Sale20240114044 – amount 577.85\n • Sale20240115046 – amount 10,161.65\n • Sale20240116047 – amount 9,515.67\n • Sale20240116050 – amount 2,525.37\n • Sale20240119061 – amount 15,287.34\n • Sale20240120063 – amount 4,302.02\n • Sale20240121068 – amount 33,866.00\n • Sale20240122070 – amount 13,911.96\n • Sale20240125078 – amount 5,923.23\n • Sale20240126079 – amount 7,042.90\n • Sale20240126081 – amount 2,243.45\n • Sale20240127085 – amount 9,136.16\n • Sale20240129089 – amount 14,857.74\n • Sale20240129090 – amount 4,034.58\n • Sale20240129091 – amount 7,088.90\n • Sale20240130093 – amount 7,835.98\n • Sale20240131098 – amount 35,082.76\n • Sale20240201100 – amount 7,129.04\n • Sale20240201102 – amount 10,086.60\n\nWhen you add these up – you get a total of 290,435.30.\n\nBecause a rise in AR is a “use” of cash, the cash flow statement reports it as a negative change. (Since our beginning AR balance was zero, an ending receivable balance of 290,435.30 means that accounts receivable increased by that amount.)\n\nThus, the final line item is:\n\n{\n  \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-290435.30\"\n}\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format. \n\n--------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-290435.30\"}}\n```",
