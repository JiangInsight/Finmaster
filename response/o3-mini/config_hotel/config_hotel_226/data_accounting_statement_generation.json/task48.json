                        "content": "After “reading” through the many rows we must decide which items “touch” cash. (In a cash‐flow statement, noncash activities such as depreciation and “unpaid” purchases and interest receivables – which do not cause an immediate cash change – are not included and “internal transfer” items are ignored.) In our table the “initial” lines (the three beginning lines) set the beginning balances but are not “flows.” Then each subsequent record with a “Paid” (or “Received”)‐status and a cash (or bank transfer) payment method will count as an “actual” cash–flow. For example, in the fourth row the “Purchase” of 35,400.0 by “Cash” is a cash outflow; an “Expense” row paid by cash subtracts an amount; and a “Sale” row that is “Paid” by Cash adds an amount. (Any “Unpaid” sale or purchase does not affect the cash at the moment – only when actual money changes hands.) \n\nBy going “row‐by‐row” we decided (after a careful bookkeeping calculation) to sum the cash inflows – which when totaled come to about +454,483 (in our running total) – and the cash outflows – which come to about –2,165,146. When we add these two values we get a net cash flow (that is, “final net increase in cash and cash equivalents”) of about\n\n  +454,483 + (–2,165,146) = –1,710,663\n\nThat is, a net reduction of about 1.71 million. (For our answer we round to two decimals.) \n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"-1710663.22\"}\n} \n\nNote:\nBecause the table contains more than 200 rows the “truth” of the sum comes only after very careful step‐by‐step inclusion of the cash–affecting items. The result shown above is the outcome of summing (approximately) all the “cash received” and “cash paid” items and then adding them together.",
