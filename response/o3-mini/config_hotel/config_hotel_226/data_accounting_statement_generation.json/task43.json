                        "content": "We must “simulate” a cash‐flow calculation using only the “cash” transactions that affect operations. (In other words, we ignore the initial financing deposits, non‐cash items like depreciation and changes in work‐in‐process and also purchases/receipts that have not “paid” status.) For the purpose of this exercise we treat a “Paid” (or “Received” in the case of sales) transaction as a “cash” flow, and we ignore items that—although recorded as a purchase/expense/sale—were entered as “Unpaid” (or noncash, like depreciation).\n\nBelow is one way to solve the problem step‐by‐step. (Note: In actual practice one would use software to “sum” all the operating “inflows” and “outflows” based on the type, payment method and status; here we “manually” walk through the table and include only those lines that have a cash effect on operating activities.)\n\nFor example, from the table we decide that the following types belong to operating activities:\n\n• “Purchase” transactions (but only if the “payment/receipt_status” is “Paid” and the “payment_method” is “Cash” or (in some cases) “Bank Transfer” – here we assume that if the cash is “paid” it leaves the operating cash pool)\n• “Expense” transactions (only those “Paid” by cash)\n• “Sale” transactions (only those “Paid” by cash; if the sale is “Unpaid” it is recorded on account so no operating cash effect)\n• “Interest Receivables” and “Depreciation” are noncash (or, if unpaid, not yet received) so they are not included.\n\nThen (with each transaction the “amount” is used):\n\n1. We ignore the “Initial” (cash deposit, bank deposit) and “Fixed Assets” lines because these are not operating.\n\n2. Every “Purchase” whose status is Paid is recorded as a cash outflow.\n • For instance, the “Purchase20231231001” line shows amount 35,400.0 paid “by Cash” → outflow –35,400.0.\n • Other Purchase lines that are “Unpaid” (or having payment method “Account Payable”) are ignored.\n\n3. Every “Expense” that is Paid in cash is an outflow:\n • For example, on 2024‑01‑01 the Sales Expense of 208.92 and the Administrative Expense of 226.27 are each subtracted.\n\n4. Every “Sale” that is “Paid” (and with receive method “Cash”) is an inflow.\n • For example, the “Sale20240102002” has 839.44 received in cash, so that is added.\n • “Sale” lines that are “Unpaid” are not included.\n\nIf we “go line‐by‐line” (the following is our “working” summary of our selection):\n\nOperating cash outflows (all “Paid” outflows):\n Purchase20231231001: –35,400.00

+460,671.70.\n\nFinally, the net operating cash flow is the sum of inflows plus outflows (remember outflows are a negative number):\n\n Net = 460,671.70 – 950,892.87 = –490,221.17\n\nThus, the final net cash flow from operating activities is about –490,221.17.\n\nBelow is the requested answer in JSON:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-490221.17\"}}\n``` \n\n(Please note: Because the table is very long, a manual “step‐by‐step” calculation may have rounding differences. In our working the final answer is taken as –490,221.17.)",
