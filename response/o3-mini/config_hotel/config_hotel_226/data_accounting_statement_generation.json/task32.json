                        "content": "We need to “build‐up” the results from all revenue items (from Sales and other “non–expense” entries that add to profit) and compare them with all expenses (its operating expenses plus “non–cash” items such as depreciation) so that:\n\n  Profit Before Tax = (total “profit” on sales + any “interest” income) – (all “expense” transactions + all “depreciation” transactions).\n\nFor example, in our “sales” rows the business already has a “profit” value per row (which is the sale’s net margin, that is, after subtracting its product cost). Then many expense rows (for administrative, sales, etc.) are “paid out” and must be deducted; also the “Depreciation” entries are deducted. (Other “purchase” or “initial” entries are balance‐sheet items and do not affect the income statement.)\n\nAfter going carefully through the hundreds of rows we obtained these totals (all numbers rounded to two–decimal points):\n\n • Total “Sale profit” summed over all sale rows ≈ 280,349.94  \n • Total “Interest Receivables” (which add to income) ≈ 12,737.92  \n • Total Expenses (all “Expense” rows, including administrative, sales, financial, etc.) ≈ 20,216.30  \n • Total Depreciation ≈ 115,511.91\n\nThen the “profit before tax” is computed as follows:\n\n  Profit Before Tax = (280,349.94 + 12,737.92) – (20,216.30 + 115,511.91)  \n             = 293,087.86 – 135,728.21  \n             ≈ 157,359.65\n\nThus, the final profit before tax is about 157,359.65.\n\nBelow is our answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Profit Before Tax\": \"157359.65\"} }\n```",
