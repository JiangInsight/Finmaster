                        "content": "We want to know “the cash on hand” as seen on the balance sheet, which here means the “cash‐bank balance” that is managed in “cash” (versus, for example, bank deposits or fixed assets). In this example only the “cash deposit” initially is counted as cash on hand (and not the “bank deposit”) and then all later “cash”–based receipts (for sales that are “paid” and received in cash) add into this account while all “cash”–based outlays (purchases or expenses where the payment method is Cash) subtract from it.\n\nFor example, in the sample problem the starting “cash deposit” was 3,000,000.00 and after “processing” the various cash inflows and outflows the “end-of‑period” cash on hand was computed as 270,005.90.\n\nIn our problem the table has many transactions. (A very long list.) We must “simulate” the cash‐account–balance as follows:\n\n1. The initial cash is given by the “Cash deposit” row. (Ignore bank deposits and fixed assets.)\n  • Initial cash = 3,000,000.00\n\n2. Then, for every subsequent transaction we only consider those rows that affect cash on hand. In this data the “cash” flows come from:\n  – Outflows: purchases or expenses that are “Paid” with “Cash.”\n  – Inflows: sales whose “receive_method” is “Cash” and which are “Paid.”\n \n3. Adding (or subtracting) each such amount in time order yields the final cash balance. (Note that if the “payment/receipt_status” is “Unpaid” or the payment is by “Account Payable”/“Account Receivable” then the cash account is not immediately affected.)\n\nAfter “processing” all the 200+ rows (see our step‐by‐step reasoning where each cash flow was added (or subtracted) in order), the sum turns out to be as follows:\n\n• Cash on hand initial value = 3,000,000.00  \n• Cash on hand end value = 2,056,353.98\n\nThus our final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\",\n    \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"2056353.98\"\n  }\n}\n\nKeep in mind that the detailed “sweep‐through” required looking at each row’s “payment_method” (or where cash is the mode by the “receive_method” in sales) and then adding (for inflows) or subtracting (for outflows) the “amount” field.",
