In our case the only relevant activity is that for fixed-asset investing. (Other purchases – such as food–related items, room inventories, etc. – are operating transactions and are not considered part of investing activities.) \n\nNotice that the file contains an “initial” fixed assets record (row 3: type “Fixed Assets” with 8,000,000.0) which is used to set up the balance of fixed assets as of the beginning. In a cash‐flow statement the opening balance is not “flowed” but the actual cash paid (or received) later is shown. In our data the only cash (out)flow that relates to a fixed asset is the row with id \n  FixedAsset20231231001 \nand type “Fixed Assets Purchase” with an amount of 383011.45. (In our sample problem the initial fixed assets row was not included in the investing activities – only the fixed‐asset purchase transaction was “flowed”.)\n\nBecause purchasing a fixed asset is a cash outflow (investing cash outflow) we take the 383011.45 (recorded as a cash payment) and assign a negative sign.\n\nThus, the final net cash flow from investing activities is –383011.45.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-383011.45\"}}",
