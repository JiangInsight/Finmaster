                        "content": "We need to “simulate” how the bank‐deposit account is affected by the transactions. In our records the very first “initial” entry tells you the bank deposit started at 5,000,000.00. Then (looking through the list) you identify only those payment records that are paid “by bank transfer” (or in a “Bank Transfer” payment method) because these transactions are “drawn” from the bank account. In our data there are three such records:\n\n1. A purchase (id “Purchase20231231014”) has a payment method “Bank Transfer” with an amount of 34,500.00.\n2. One “Fixed Assets Purchase” (id “FixedAsset20231231001”) appears with a paid amount of 830,405.75 – and the payment method is “Bank Transfer.”\n3. A second “Fixed Assets Purchase” (again id “FixedAsset20231231001”) appears later with a paid amount of 383,011.45 (again paid by bank transfer).\n\nNo other entries affect the bank deposit account directly. (Any transaction paid “by Cash” or rather recorded “Account Payable” does not immediately affect the bank‐deposit balance.) \n\nThus, the bank account was decreased by the sum of these bank‑transfer payments:\n  34,500.00 + 830,405.75 + 383,011.45 = 1,247,917.20\n\nSubtracting that from the initial bank deposit of 5,000,000.00 gives us the ending bank deposit balance:\n\n  5,000,000.00 – 1,247,917.20 = 3,752,082.80\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"3752082.80\"}}",
