(None of them record any initial liability balance.) Therefore, the “initial current liabilities” balance is 0.00.\n\nThe “final current liabilities” in this set of transactions come from the purchase transactions that have been recorded “Unpaid” (that is, the business still owes money). Reviewing the transactions on or before 2023‑12‑31 for purchases, we must pick out only those purchases whose “payment/receipt_status” is “Unpaid” (and whose payment method is “Account Payable”). In our data the following purchase transactions meet that criteria (their amounts are taken from the “amount” field):\n\n1. Purchase20231231002: 696,960.0  \n2. Purchase20231231003: 394,560.0  \n3.
