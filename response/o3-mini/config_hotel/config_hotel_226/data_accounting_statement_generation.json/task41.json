                        "content": "We need to figure out how the transactions that “hit” accounts payable change its ending balance. In our system purchases may be recorded as “Unpaid” with a payment method of “Account Payable” – and these will “add” to accounts payable. (In contrast, if a purchase was paid in cash or by bank transfer, it does not increase the accounts payable balance.) \n\nStep 1. Go through the list and pick out only the Purchase transactions whose “payment/receipt_status” is “Unpaid” and whose “payment_method” is “Account Payable.”\n\nBelow is a list of those rows along with their amount:\n\n• Row with id Purchase20231231002: amount = 696960.0  \n• Purchase20231231003: amount = 394560.0  \n• Purchase20231231004: amount = 286000.0  \n• Purchase20231231008: amount = 544000.0  \n• Purchase20231231009: amount = 43400.0  \n• Purchase20231231010: amount = 21900.0  \n• Purchase20231231011: amount = 163500.0  \n• Purchase20231231012: amount = 235500.0  \n• Purchase20231231013: amount = 466560.0  \n• Purchase20231231015: even though it is a Purchase this one is “Unpaid” (and its payment method is Account Payable) so amount = 800000.0  \n• Purchase20231231016: amount = 685000.0  \n• Purchase20231231017: amount = 78400.0  \n• Purchase20231231018: amount = 64750.0  \n• Purchase20231231019: amount = 1075000.0  \n• Purchase20231231020: amount = 236720.0  \n• Purchase20231231021: amount = 1115000.0  \n• Purchase20231231022: amount = 88880.0  \n• Purchase20231231025: amount = 570240.0  \n\nStep 2. Now add these amounts up, making sure to use the “recorded_amount” (in our case the “amount” values) from each qualifying row. We proceed step by step:\n\n1. 696960.0 + 394560.0 = 1,091,520.0  \n2. 1,091,520.0 + 286000.0 = 1,377,520.0  \n3. 1,377,520.0 + 544000.0 = 1,921,520.0  \n4. 1,921,520.0 + 43400.0 = 1,964,920.0  \n5. 1,964,920.0 + 21900.0 = 1,986,820.0  \n6. 1,986,820.0 + 163500.0 = 2,150,320.0  \n7. 2,150,320.0 + 235500.0 = 2,385,820.0  \n8. 2,385,820.0 + 466560.0 = 2,852,380.0  \n9. 2,852,380.0 + 800000.0 = 3,652,380.0  \n10. 3,652,380.0 + 685000.0 = 4,337,380.0  \n11. 4,337,380.0 + 78400.0 = 4,415,780.0  \n12. 4,415,780.0 + 64750.0 = 4,480,530.0  \n13. 4,480,530.0 + 1075000.0 = 5,555,530.0  \n14. 5,555,530.0 + 236720.0 = 5,792,250.0  \n15. 5,792,250.0 + 1115000.0 = 6,907,250.0  \n16. 6,907,250.0 + 88880.0 = 6,996,130.0  \n17. 6,996,130.0 + 570240.0 = 7,566,370.0  \n\nThus the sum of all “Unpaid” purchase amounts (the amount that is “booked” to accounts payable) is 7,566,370.0.\n\nStep 3. Because there is no information about beginning accounts payable (and no transactions seem to “reduce” it), the increase (net change) in accounts payable is the sum above.\n\nSo the final answer will be:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"7566370.00\"\n  }\n}\n\nBelow is our answer presented in the requested JSON format. \n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer:\n────────────────────────────\n \n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"7566370.00\"}\n}",
