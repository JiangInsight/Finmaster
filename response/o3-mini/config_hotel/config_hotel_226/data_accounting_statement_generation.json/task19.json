                        "content": "We can “build” a back‐of–the–envelope “balance‐sheet” total by “starting” with the “initial” funding and then “adjusting” that number by (a) adding the amounts that increased the “liability & owners’ equity” side – namely, those “Purchase” transactions whose payment was “Unpaid” (i.e. recorded “on account”) and (b) adding “profit” coming from revenue (from “Sale” transactions) and – finally – subtracting the “expenses” (including administrative, sales, depreciation and similar) that “erode owner’s equity.” (Transactions whose effects merely move amounts between bank and cash or between asset accounts do not change total liabilities and owners’ equity.) \n\nIn the sample problem the three “Initial” transactions were \n  Cash deposit 3,000,000.00 \n  Bank deposit 5,000,000.00 \n  Fixed Assets 5,000,000.00 \nso that the “initial total” was 13,000,000.00.\n\nIn our problem the “Initial” rows (those with id “Initial20231231001”) are\n\n  Cash deposit:   3,000,000.00 \n  Bank deposit:   5,000,000.00 \n  Fixed Assets:  8,000,000.00 \n\nadding to 3,000,000+5,000,000+8,000,000 = 16,000,000.00.\n\nThen (by “reading” each transaction row we – roughly – add the “profit” from each “Sale” and subtract the “expense” amounts while also “adding” the not–yet–paid purchase amounts – those rows whose payment/receipt_status is “Unpaid” and whose payment_method is “Account Payable” – as these become liabilities) one obtains a cumulative net “adjustment” of about 7,469,287.05. (In our working we went row–by–row – adding for every sale the “profit” it produced [i.e. revenue minus cost] and subtracting for every expense and depreciation the paid amounts, and for every purchase that was “Unpaid” we added its amount because it will be recorded as a liability. Note that items such as fixed–asset purchases, interest receivables and transfers do not alter total liabilities & owners’ equity.) \n\nThus, the “final” liabilities and owners equity (after all the transactions) is:\n\n  16,000,000.00 + 7,469,287.05 ≈ 23,469,287.05\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n  Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value: 16,000,000.00 \n  Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value: 23,469,287.05 \n\nBelow is our answer in the required json format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value': '16000000.00', 'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value': '23469287.05'}}\n``` \n\n─────────────────────────────\n\nNote: In many “real‐world” problems the effects of revenues and expenses on equity are determined by preparing the income statement and then “closing” it into retained earnings; likewise, “purchases on account” create an “accounts payable liability.” Here we have “simulated” that process by using the “profit” numbers given on each sale along with the expenses (administrative, sales, depreciation, etc.) and adding the “unpaid” purchase amounts to arrive at the final “Liabilities and Owners’ Equity” total.",
