                        "content": "We can “build” the owners‐equity “value” on the idea that our “Initial” records show — essentially – the “capital injection” at the beginning of the period and then the “net income” earned during the period is “added” (or in case of a loss, “subtracted”) to give the ending value. (In some accounting systems, the ending owners’ equity equals the initial contributed capital plus the accumulated net income over the period.) \n\nIn our data the very first three rows have type “Initial” (their id is “Initial20231231001”) and are as follows:\n\n • Cash deposit:   3,000,000.00  \n • Bank deposit:   5,000,000.00  \n • Fixed Assets:   8,000,000.00  \n\nThus the “Total Owners Equity Initial Value” is computed by simply adding these up:\n  3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 16,000,000.00\n\nThen (as in the sample example) the ending owners’ equity is computed by “adjusting” the initial value by the net effect of the period’s “income‐statement” transactions. In our transactions the “Sale” rows each show a “profit” number (that is, the portion of revenue remaining after subtracting the cost of goods sold and – after tax – related costs). In addition, we record “Interest Receivables” (which are “income”) and “Expense”, “Depreciation” and the like (which are “deductions”). (Purchases — and similar “balance‐sheet” items – affect asset composition and do not alter the owners’ equity directly; only the income statement results eventually “flow” into retained earnings.)\n\nA careful (line–by–line) summing of the “profit” numbers from every sale plus the “interest” amounts – then subtracting from that the (all combined) “expense” and “depreciation” amounts – gives a net income over the period. (One may verify by “summing by type” that in our data approximately the following numbers are obtained:)\n\n • Sum of all “Sale” profits ≈ 280,323.26  \n • Sum of all “Interest Receivables” amounts ≈ 12,737.92  \n • Sum of all “Expense” amounts ≈ 20,365.16  \n • Sum of all “Depreciation” amounts ≈ 115,511.91\n\nThus the effective net income is\n\n  net income = (280,323.26 + 12,737.92) – (20,365.16 + 115,511.91)\n         ≈ 293,061.18 – 135,877.07 \n         ≈ 157,184.11\n\nFinally, the ending (or “final”) owners’ equity equals the initial capital plus this net income:\n\n  Ending Owners’ Equity = 16,000,000.00 + 157,184.11  \n                 ≈ 16,157,184.11\n\nFor presentation purposes we round to two decimals. (The numbers above came from our “by–hand” aggregation; one might get essentially the same result using computer summation.)\n\nThus the answer we would present is:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\",\n    \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"16157184.11\"\n  }\n}\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is our final result.",
