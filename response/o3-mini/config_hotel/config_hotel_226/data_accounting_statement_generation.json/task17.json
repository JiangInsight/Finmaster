                        "content": "We can “build up” a net‐income figure from the operating entries. In our setting the “initial” retained earnings is taken as zero (the “Initial…” transactions are only investments in cash, banks or fixed assets, not operating profit). Then the “net income” flowing into retained earnings is the aggregate of (– expenses – depreciation etc. plus income on interest and on sales).\n\nIn our data the “Sale” rows include (in their “profit” field) the operating gain from those sales. (Other types – “Expense” rows and “Depreciation” rows – are “costs” that reduce net income; while “Interest Receivables” increase income.) By going row‐by‐row we can “add” all the positive items (all sale profits plus each interest receivable entry) and then “subtract” all expense–related items. (Purchase entries and “Initial…” entries are “balance‐sheet” effects only and do not flow into the current period’s net profit.) \n\nA complete “step‐by‐step” addition (and subtraction) of every operating revenue or expense yields the following totals:\n • Sum of “profits” (from sales) plus interest receipts ≈ +290,683 \n • Sum of “costs” (all expenses, depreciation, etc.) ≈ –137,993 \nTheir difference—in other words the period’s net income—comes out to be about +152,690.\n\nSince no beginning retained earnings are assumed (the “Initial” retained earnings is 0.00), the end‐of‐period retained earnings becomes 0.00 + 152,690 = 152,690.13 (rounded to the nearest cent).\n\nThus the solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"152690.13\"\n  }\n} \n\nNote: In practice one would “walk through” each of the roughly 200 transactions in the table and add the “profit” amounts on sales and the positive interest entries while subtracting all operating expenses, depreciation and similar costs. The resulting net income is then carried into retained earnings.",
