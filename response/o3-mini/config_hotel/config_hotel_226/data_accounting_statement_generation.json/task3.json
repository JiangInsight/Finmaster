                        "content": "We wish to “build up” the balance‐sheet item “inventory” by assuming that at the beginning (after the “initial” entries) no inventory is on‐hand – then every purchase of a product increases inventory (by its “cost” – here determined from quantity × cost_per_unit) and every sale of a product “reduces” inventory by its cost (again determined by quantity × cost_per_unit). (All transactions that concern “Fixed Assets” or “Cash/Bank” in the “Initial…” rows are not “inventory”.)\n\nIn the table below the only “initial” rows are three “Initial20231231001” records. None of these record a beginning inventory (they just put cash, bank and fixed assets). Thus we start with an initial inventory value of 0.00.\n\nThen, if we “read‐through” the file and add up – for every “Purchase” row – the (quantity × cost_per_unit) and subtract – for every “Sale” row – the (quantity × cost_per_unit) we get (approximately) the inventory “ending” cost.\n\nFor example (showing a few sample computations):\n\n• For the row with id Purchase20231231001 (a purchase of product F001 “Quick Meal Set”) the entry is: quantity = 236, cost_per_unit = 150.0, so that purchase adds 236×150.0 = 35,400.0 to inventory.\n\n• Similarly, for each “Purchase” row (by checking all rows with type “Purchase”) one obtains a total (by adding the “amount” provided — which equals quantity × cost_per_unit) that sums to\n\n  8,962,650.0\n\n• Then, for each “Sale” row we “remove” inventory at cost. For example, the sale with id Sale20240102002 involves selling 4 units at a cost of 150.0 each so that 4×150.0 = 600.0 is “taken out.” Doing that for every “Sale” row and summing these “costs” we get a total cost that has been “removed” of\n\n  508,690.0\n\nThus the end‐of–period inventory value is computed by\n\n  Inventory End Value = (Initial inventory) + (Total Purchases cost) − (Total Sales cost)\n            = 0.00 + 8,962,650.0 − 508,690.0 \n            = 8,453,960.0\n\nSo in our answer we have:\n\nInitial inventory = \"0.00\"  \nEnding inventory = \"8453960.00\"\n\nWe now report the answer in the requested json format.\n\nFinal answer:\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Inventory End Value\": \"8453960.00\"}}",
