In our file (with the columns corresponding to “tax_amount” and “after_tax_amount” etc) only the sale entries include a non‐empty tax amount. (Other entries such as purchases, expenses, depreciation, fixed asset entries, etc. do not contain any tax value.) Therefore the “tax expense” is taken to be the sum of the tax_amount fields from all sale transactions.\n\nStep‐by‐step we do the following:\n\n1. Look at every row with type “Sale” (its id starts with “Sale”) and note the tax_amount from that row.\n2. For example the very first sale row is (Sale20240102002) whose tax_amount is 41.97; the next sale (Sale20240102003) has 23.00; then subsequent sale rows such as Sale20240104005 (659.92), Sale20240104006 (132.92), Sale20240104007 (1121.09), etc.\n3. Adding the tax_amount values from every sale row in the full data (there are more than 80 such rows) gives a grand total of about 39,512.78.\n\nThus, the “final tax expense” reported on the income statement is 39,512.78.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Tax Expense\": \"39512.78\"}\n}",
