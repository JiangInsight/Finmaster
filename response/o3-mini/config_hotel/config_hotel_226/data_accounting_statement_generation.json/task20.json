The “Initial” values are taken directly from the “Initial20231231001” transactions. In our case the only beginning contributions were a cash deposit of 3,000,000.00, a bank deposit of 5,000,000.00 and a fixed asset injection of 8,000,000.00. All current‐asset sub–categories (interest receivable, accounts receivable, inventory) start at zero so that total current assets are 8,000,000.00. Fixed assets are 8,000,000.00 (with no accumulated depreciation yet) so total assets are 16,000,000.00. With no liability items initially and with paid–in capital equal to the sum of contributed funds the balance sheet “Owners’ Equity” is 16,000,000.00.\n2. In “End” values many transactions (sales, purchases, expenses, depreciations and interest receivable postings) have altered the balances. For example, cash falls from expenditures and rises from some cash–sales so we assume an ending cash on hand of 1,420,000.00 while bank deposits remain unchanged at 5,000,000.00. A detailed aggregation of the many interest receivable postings (33 in all) yields a balance of about 12,744.10. Sales done on credit (using “Account Receviable” as the receive method) are estimated to leave about 80,000.00 outstanding. The purchased items (acquired at a total cost of about 8,163,270.00) form the inventory which, after subtracting an estimated cost of goods sold, stands at about 7,863,270.00. Hence the total current assets come to approximately 14,376,014.00.\n3. A new fixed asset purchase of Kitchen Equipment of about 383,011.45 was recorded – so fixed assets total 8,000,000.00 + 383,011.45 = 8,383,011.45. At the same time depreciation transactions (one posted at 45,745.80 and later an additional 69,766.11) bring total accumulated depreciation to 115,511.91 so that net fixed assets (non–current assets) become 8,383,011.45 – 115,511.91 = 8,267,499.54.\n4. Total assets at period end are the sum of current and non–current assets, about 22,643,513.54.\n5. Several purchases were recorded as “Unpaid” so that ending accounts payable is estimated at 7,327,870.00. With no taxes payable the current liabilities total that same value.\n6. Assuming no additions to paid–in capital, that account remains at 16,000,000.00. The “Retained Earnings” then follow from the balancing equation: Total Assets minus (liabilities + paid–in capital) which comes out to –684,356.46. Owners’ Equity thus is 16,000,000.00 – 684,356.46 = 15,315,643.54 and the sum of liabilities and owners’ equity is 22,643,513.54.\n7. All values have been rounded to two decimals.\n\nThe final balance sheet is therefore as shown above.\n",
