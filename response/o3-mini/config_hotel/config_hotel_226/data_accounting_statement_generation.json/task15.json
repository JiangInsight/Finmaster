                        "content": "We can “build” the balance‐sheet by scanning through the transaction list and “picking” those transactions that (by their characteristics) increase the company’s obligations – that is, the “liability side”. In our system only the “Purchases” (that are not paid “in cash” but rather booked as “Account Payable”) count as liabilities. (Other entries—such as interest receivables, sales and expenses—are either income or assets when “received” or “to be received.” In our reporting the “Initial” items (for cash, bank and fixed assets) are already “asset” side items, so no initial liability is recorded.) \n\nStep‑by‑step we do the following:\n\n1. Look at the “Initial…” rows. In our new data the three “Initial20231231001” rows are \n  – Cash deposit (3,000,000.0)\n  – Bank deposit (5,000,000.0)\n  – Fixed Assets (8,000,000.0)\nAll of these are asset “opening” balances so they add no liability; therefore the “Initial liabilities” total is 0.00.\n\n2. Then we scan for “Purchase” transactions that have “Unpaid” as payment/receipt_status (usually with a payment_method of “Account Payable” or not paid in cash). In our data the following purchases are “unpaid” (their “amount” is the recorded amount):\n\n   • Purchase20231231002: 696,960.0  \n   • Purchase20231231003: 394,560.0  \n   • Purchase20231231004: 286,000.0  \n   • Purchase20231231008: 544,000.0  \n   • Purchase20231231009: 43,400.0  \n   • Purchase20231231010: 21,900.0  \n   • Purchase20231231011: 163,500.0  \n   • Purchase20231231012: 235,500.0  \n   • Purchase20231231013: 466,560.0  \n   • Purchase20231231015: 800,000.0  \n   • Purchase20231231016: 685,000.0  \n   • Purchase20231231017: 78,400.0  \n   • Purchase20231231018: 64,750.0  \n   • Purchase20231231019: 1,075,000.0  \n   • Purchase20231231020: 236,720.0  \n   • Purchase20231231021: 1,115,000.0  \n   • Purchase20231231022: 88,880.0  \n   • Purchase20231231025: 570,240.0  \n\n3. Now add these “unpaid purchase” amounts step‐by‐step:\n\n  a. 696,960.0 + 394,560.0 = 1,091,520.0  \n  b. 1,091,520.0 + 286,000.0 = 1,377,520.0  \n  c. 1,377,520.0 + 544,000.0 = 1,921,520.0  \n  d. 1,921,520.0 + 43,400.0 = 1,964,920.0  \n  e. 1,964,920.0 + 21,900.0 = 1,986,820.0  \n  f. 1,986,820.0 + 163,500.0 = 2,150,320.0  \n  g. 2,150,320.0 + 235,500.0 = 2,385,820.0  \n  h. 2,385,820.0 + 466,560.0 = 2,852,380.0  \n  i. 2,852,380.0 + 800,000.0 = 3,652,380.0  \n  j. 3,652,380.0 + 685,000.0 = 4,337,380.0  \n  k. 4,337,380.0 + 78,400.0 = 4,415,780.0  \n  l. 4,415,780.0 + 64,750.0 = 4,480,530.0  \n  m. 4,480,530.0 + 1,075,000.0 = 5,555,530.0  \n  n. 5,555,530.0 + 236,720.0 = 5,792,250.0  \n  o. 5,792,250.0 + 1,115,000.0 = 6,907,250.0  \n  p. 6,907,250.0 + 88,880.0 = 6,996,130.0  \n  q. 6,996,130.0 + 570,240.0 = 7,566,370.0  \n\nThis sum (7,566,370.0) is the total “unpaid” – that is, the ending total of liabilities (trades payables) in our balance‐sheet.\n\n4. Therefore, the “Initial Liability” value remains 0.00 while the “Final Liability” (from all unpaid purchase obligations) is 7,566,370.00.\n\nThus, we answer in the required json format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"7566370.00\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis is our final answer.",
