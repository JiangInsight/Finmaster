                        "content": "Let's extract the necessary numbers and perform the calculations step by step.\n\n1. Current Ratio  \n   Use the Total Current Assets and Total Current Liabilities (from the balance sheet at end date).  \n   • Total Current Assets = 14,619,619.72  \n   • Total Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91  \n   Calculation: 14,619,619.72 ÷ 7,605,149.91 ≈ 1.92  \n\n2. Gross Profit Margin  \n   From the income statement, use Gross Profit and Total Revenue.  \n   • Gross Profit = 279,378.77  \n   • Total Revenue = 775,598.77  \n   Calculation: (279,378.77 ÷ 775,598.77) × 100 ≈ 36.00%  \n\n3. Debt to Asset Ratio  \n   In this simplified case, total liabilities are the current liabilities because no separate non-current liabilities are given.  \n   • Total Liabilities = 7,605,149.91  \n   • Total Assets = 23,717,525.01  \n   Calculation: 7,605,149.91 ÷ 23,717,525.01 ≈ 0.32  \n\n4. Net Profit Margin  \n   From the income statement, use Net Profit and Total Revenue.  \n   • Net Profit = 112,375.10  \n   • Total Revenue = 775,598.77  \n   Calculation: (112,375.10 ÷ 775,598.77) × 100 ≈ 14.49%  \n\n5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio  \n   The cash available is calculated by summing Cash on Hand and Bank Deposits.  \n   • Cash on Hand = 2,067,352.98  \n   • Bank Deposits = 3,752,082.80  \n   Total Cash = 2,067,352.98 + 3,752,082.80 = 5,819,435.78  \n   • Total Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91  \n   Calculation: 5,819,435.78 ÷ 7,605,149.91 ≈ 0.77  \n\n6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)  \n   FCF is calculated as Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities minus Capital Expenditures (in this case, Purchase of Fixed Assets).  \n   • Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -967,147.02  \n   • Capital Expenditures = 1,213,417.20  \n   Calculation: -967,147.02 - 1,213,417.20 = -2,180,564.22  \n\n7. Return on Assets (ROA)  \n   Using Net Profit and Total Assets from the balance sheet.  \n   • Net Profit = 112,375.10  \n   • Total Assets = 23,717,525.01  \n   Calculation: (112,375.10 ÷ 23,717,525.01) × 100 ≈ 0.47%  \n\nThus, the final results are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"1.92\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"36.00%\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.32\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"14.49%\",\n    \"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"0.77\",\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-2180564.22\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"0.47%\"\n  }\n}",
