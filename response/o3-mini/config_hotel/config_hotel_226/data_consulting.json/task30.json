Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \n   = 14,619,619.72 / 7,605,149.91  \n   ≈ 1.92\n\n2. Quick Ratio = (Current Assets – Inventory) / Current Liabilities  \n   = (14,619,619.72 – 8,466,430.00) / 7,605,149.91  \n   = 6,153,189.72 / 7,605,149.91  \n   ≈ 0.81\n\n3. Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets  \n   = 7,605,149.91 / 23,717,525.01  \n   ≈ 0.32\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Owner's Equity  \n   = 7,605,149.91 / 16,112,375.10  \n   ≈ 0.47\n\n5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Liabilities  \n   = –967,147.02 / 7,605,149.91  \n   ≈ –0.13\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"1.92\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.81\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.32\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.47\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.13\"\n  }\n}",
