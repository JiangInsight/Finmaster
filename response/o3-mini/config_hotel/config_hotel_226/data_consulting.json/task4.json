(There are no additional non-current liabilities provided, so we use this figure.)\n• Total Owner's Equity: The End_amount is 16,112,375.10.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio.\nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n= 7,605,149.91 / 16,112,375.10\n\nStep 3: Perform the division.\n7,605,149.91 ÷ 16,112,375.10 ≈ 0.47\n\nThus, the Debt to Equity Ratio as of the end of the reporting period is approximately 0.47.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.47'}\n}",
