Identify the values from the financial statements at the end date.\n\n• From the balance sheet:  \n – Current Assets (end) = 14,619,619.72  \n – Inventory (end) = 8,466,430.00  \n – Current Liabilities (end) = 7,605,149.91  \n – Owner’s Equity (end) = 16,112,375.10  \n\n• From the cash flow statement:  \n – Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –967,147.02  \n\n• From the income statement and other info:  \n – Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = 496,220.00  \n  (For inventory turnover we need average inventory. Since initial inventory is 0, average inventory = (0 + 8,466,430.00)/2 = 4,233,215.00)  \n\nStep 2. Calculate each ratio.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n Formula = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n = –967,147.02 / 7,605,149.91  \n ≈ –0.1272 → Rounded to –0.13\n\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \n Often this is calculated in a similar manner using total debt. In our balance sheet only Current Liabilities (debt) are given, so  \n Formula = Operating Cash Flow / Total (Current) Liabilities  \n = –967,147.02 / 7,605,149.91  \n ≈ –0.1272 → Rounded to –0.13\n\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio  \n Formula = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  \n Average Inventory = 4,233,215.00  \n = 496,220.00 / 4,233,215.00  \n ≈ 0.1172 → Rounded to 0.12\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n Formula = Total Liabilities / Owner’s Equity  \n = 7,605,149.91 / 16,112,375.10  \n ≈ 0.4723 → Rounded to 0.47\n\n5. Quick Ratio  \n Formula = (Current Assets – Inventory) / Current Liabilities  \n = (14,619,619.72 – 8,466,430.00) / 7,605,149.91  \n = 6,153,189.72 / 7,605,149.91  \n ≈ 0.809 → Rounded to 0.81\n\n6. Current Ratio  \n Formula = Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \n = 14,619,619.72 / 7,605,149.91  \n ≈ 1.922 → Rounded to 1.92\n\nStep 3. Present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.13\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.13\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"0.12\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.47\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.81\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"1.92\"\n  }\n}",
