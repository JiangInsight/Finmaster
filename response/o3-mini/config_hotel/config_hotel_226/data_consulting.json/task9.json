Cash and Cash Equivalents from the balance sheet are represented by two accounts:\n  • Cash on Hand (End_amount): 2,067,352.98  \n  • Bank Deposits (End_amount): 3,752,082.80  \n  Summing these gives the total cash available:  \n   Total Cash = 2,067,352.98 + 3,752,082.80 = 5,819,435.78\n\n2. Current Debt is typically taken as the Total Current Liabilities. Here, the balance sheet shows:  \n  Total Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91\n\nNow, the Cash to Current Debt Ratio is calculated as:  \n  Cash to Current Debt Ratio = Total Cash / Total Current Liabilities\n\nSubstitute the values:  \n  Ratio = 5,819,435.78 / 7,605,149.91 ≈ 0.7657\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the ratio is approximately 0.77.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"0.77\"}\n}",
