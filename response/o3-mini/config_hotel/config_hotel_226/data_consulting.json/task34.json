                        "content": "We start by extracting the key numbers from the statements (all numbers are taken from the End_amount amounts):\n\n1. From the balance sheet:\n • Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91  \n • Total Assets = 23,717,525.01  \n • Owner’s Equity = 16,112,375.10  \n • Inventory = 8,466,430.00  \n • Other current assets (cash on hand, bank deposits, interest receivable, accounts receivable) are given and “Total Current Assets” is 14,619,619.72.\n\n2. From the cash flow statement:\n • Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –967,147.02\n\n3. From the income statement:\n • Main Business Revenue = 775,598.77  \n • Net Profit = 112,375.10  \n • Accounts Receivable at period–end = 321,015.98  \n • (Assuming beginning accounts receivable was 0, the average is (0 + 321,015.98)/2.)\n\nNow we compute each ratio step by step:\n\n————————————————————————————\nA. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n Formula: Operating Cash Flow ÷ Current Liabilities  \n Calculation: –967,147.02 ÷ 7,605,149.91 ≈ –0.1273  \n Rounded to two decimal places: –0.13\n\n————————————————————————————\nB. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n Here “Debt” is taken as Total Liabilities. Since there are no non‐current liabilities separately, we have:  \n Total Liabilities = Total Assets – Owner’s Equity = 23,717,525.01 – 16,112,375.10 = 7,605,149.91  \n Formula: Total Liabilities ÷ Owner’s Equity  \n Calculation: 7,605,149.91 ÷ 16,112,375.10 ≈ 0.4719  \n Rounded: 0.47\n\n————————————————————————————\nC. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n Formula: Total Revenue ÷ Total Assets  \n Calculation: 775,598.77 ÷ 23,717,525.01 ≈ 0.0327  \n Rounded (to two decimal places): 0.03\n\n————————————————————————————\nD. Quick Ratio  \n Quick Assets = Current Assets – Inventory  \n = 14,619,619.72 – 8,466,430.00 = 6,153,189.72  \n Formula: Quick Assets ÷ Current Liabilities  \n Calculation: 6,153,189.72 ÷ 7,605,149.91 ≈ 0.8087  \n Rounded: 0.81\n\n————————————————————————————\nE. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n (Here using the same numerator and denominator as in item A.)  \n = –967,147.02 ÷ 7,605,149.91 ≈ –0.13\n\n————————————————————————————\nF. Return on Equity (ROE)  \n Formula: Net Profit ÷ Owner’s Equity × 100%  \n Calculation: 112,375.10 ÷ 16,112,375.10 ≈ 0.006976  \n As a percentage: 0.6976%  \n Rounded: 0.70%\n\n————————————————————————————\nG. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n For this ratio we use:  \n Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) ÷ 2  \n Here beginning AR is 0 and ending AR is 321,015.98 so average = 321,015.98 ÷ 2 = 160,507.99  \n Formula: Main Business Revenue ÷ Average Accounts Receivable  \n Calculation: 775,598.77 ÷ 160,507.99 ≈ 4.83\n\n————————————————————————————\nNow we can present the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.13\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.47\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.81\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.13\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"0.70%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"4.83\"\n  }\n}",
