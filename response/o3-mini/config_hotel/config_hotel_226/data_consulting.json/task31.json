                        "content": "We need to calculate five ratios using the provided financial statements. Below is a step‐by‐step outline of the calculations:\n\n1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n   – Formula: Accounts Receivable Turnover = Net Sales ÷ Average Accounts Receivable.\n   – Here, we assume that “Main Business Revenue” represents net sales.\n   – Accounts Receivable:\n  • Beginning balance = 0 (given)\n  • Ending balance = 321015.98  \n  • Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 321015.98) ÷ 2 = 160507.99  \n   – Revenue = 775598.77\n   – Calculation: 775598.77 ÷ 160507.99 ≈ 4.83\n\n2. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio (and Operating Cash Flow Ratio)\n\n   – Formula: Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities ÷ Total Current Liabilities.\n   – From cash flow statement:\n  • Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –967147.02  \n   – From balance sheet:\n  • Total Current Liabilities (end) = 7605149.91\n   – Calculation: –967147.02 ÷ 7605149.91 ≈ –0.1273 (≈ –0.13)\n   – In the sample, both “operating cash flow ratio” and “operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio” are the same value.\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n   – Formula: Total Asset Turnover = Revenue ÷ Average Total Assets.\n   – Total Assets:\n  • Beginning = 16000000.00  \n  • Ending = 23717525.01  \n  • Average Total Assets = (16000000.00 + 23717525.01) ÷ 2 = 19858762.505\n   – Revenue = 775598.77\n   – Calculation: 775598.77 ÷ 19858762.505 ≈ 0.0390 (≈ 0.04)\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n   – Formula: Debt to Equity = Total Liabilities ÷ Total Owner's Equity.\n   – From balance sheet:\n  • Total Owner's Equity (end) = 16112375.10  \n  • Total Liabilities = (Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity – Owner's Equity) = 23717525.01 – 16112375.10 = 7605149.91\n   – Calculation: 7605149.91 ÷ 16112375.10 ≈ 0.4719 (≈ 0.47)\n\nThus, the final answers are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"4.83\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-0.13\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.13\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.04\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.47\"\n  }\n}",
