In this case, it is –967,147.02.\n\n• Total debt is taken as “Total Current Liabilities” from the balance sheet, which is 7,605,149.91.\n\nStep 2: Use the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio formula:\n  Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Debt)\n\nStep 3: Substitute the values:\n  = –967,147.02 / 7,605,149.91\n  ≈ –0.1272\n\nStep 4: Rounding to two decimal places gives approximately –0.13.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.13\"\n  }\n}",
