                        "content": "We first extract the key numbers from the three statements:\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 1. Identify key balances:\n\n• From the balance sheet (at end date 2024-02-05):  \n ○ Total Current Assets = 13,190,375.83  \n ○ Inventory = 7,848,830.00  \n ○ Total Current Liabilities = 5,042,389.63  \n ○ Total Owner's Equity = 16,056,497.85  \n ○ (No long‐term liabilities appear so “debt” is taken as current liabilities)\n\n• From the cash flow statement:  \n ○ Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –2,868,695.86\n\n• From the income statement:  \n ○ Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = 353,220.00  \n ○ (Inventory on the opening date is zero so average inventory = (0 + Ending inventory)/2)\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 2. Compute the Six Financial Ratios:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n Definition: Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities  \n Calculation: –2,868,695.86 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ –0.5687  \n Rounded to two decimals, ≈ –0.57\n\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \n Definition: Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt  \n Since no long‐term liabilities are reported, we take Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities.  \n Calculation: –2,868,695.86 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ –0.5687  \n Rounded, ≈ –0.57\n\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio  \n Definition: Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  \n Average Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2  \n   = (0 + 7,848,830.00)/2  \n   = 3,924,415.00  \n Calculation: 353,220.00 / 3,924,415.00 ≈ 0.0901  \n Rounded, ≈ 0.09\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n Definition: Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Owner's Equity  \n Here, Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 5,042,389.63  \n Calculation: 5,042,389.63 / 16,056,497.85 ≈ 0.314  \n Rounded, ≈ 0.31\n\n5. Quick Ratio  \n Definition: Quick Ratio = (Current Assets − Inventory) / Current Liabilities  \n Calculation: (13,190,375.83 − 7,848,830.00) = 5,341,545.83  \n Then, 5,341,545.83 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ 1.059  \n Rounded, ≈ 1.06\n\n6. Current Ratio  \n Definition: Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \n Calculation: 13,190,375.83 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ 2.616  \n Rounded, ≈ 2.62\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 3. Present the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.57\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.57\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"0.09\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.31\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.06\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"2.62\"\n  }\n}",
