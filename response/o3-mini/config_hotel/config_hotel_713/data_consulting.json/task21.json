Calculate Free Cash Flow (FCF):\n\nUsing the numbers provided, we follow the sample method of adding the net cash flows of operating and investing activities. For this problem, the Cash Flow from Operating Activities is –2,868,695.86 and the Cash Flow from Investing Activities is –0.00. Thus:\n  FCF = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) + (Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities)\n     = –2,868,695.86 + (–0.00)\n     = –2,868,695.86\n\nStep 2. Calculate the Current Assets Turnover Ratio:\n\nThis ratio is computed as the Main Business Revenue divided by the average current assets. The balance sheet presents the Total Current Assets at the initial date (8,000,000.00) and at the end date (13,190,375.83). The average current assets is:\n  Average Current Assets = (Initial Current Assets + End Current Assets) / 2\n           = (8,000,000.00 + 13,190,375.83) / 2\n           = 21,190,375.83 / 2\n           ≈ 10,595,187.915\n\nNow, the Main Business Revenue from the income statement is 547,392.30. Therefore:\n  Current Assets Turnover Ratio = Main Business Revenue / Average Current Assets\n           ≈ 547,392.30 / 10,595,187.915\n           ≈ 0.0517\nRounded to two decimal places (similar to the sample output style), this ratio becomes approximately 0.05.\n\nFinal Answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-2868695.86\",\n    \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.05\"\n  }\n}",
