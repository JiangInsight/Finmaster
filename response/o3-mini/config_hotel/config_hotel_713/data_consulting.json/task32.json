                        "content": "We can solve the problem by first extracting and then computing the required metrics. Note that we use the “average” value for Total Assets and Owner’s Equity by taking the simple average of the beginning and ending balances (this is confirmed by the sample provided).\n\nStep 1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)  \n • FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  \n  – From the cash flow, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –2,868,695.86  \n  – Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = –0.00  \n • Thus, FCF = –2,868,695.86 + (–0.00) = –2,868,695.86\n\nStep 2. Return on Assets (ROA)  \n • We first compute the average Total Assets:  \n  – Beginning Total Assets = 16,000,000.00  \n  – Ending Total Assets = 21,098,887.48  \n  – Average Total Assets = (16,000,000.00 + 21,098,887.48) / 2 = 18,549,443.74  \n • ROA = (Net Profit / Average Total Assets) × 100  \n  – Net Profit (from income statement) = 56,497.85  \n  – ROA = (56,497.85 / 18,549,443.74) × 100 ≈ 0.3046% → \"0.30%\"\n\nStep 3. Return on Equity (ROE)  \n • Compute average Owner’s Equity:  \n  – Beginning Owner’s Equity (Paid‐in Capital) = 16,000,000.00  \n  – Ending Owner’s Equity = 16,056,497.85  \n  – Average Owner’s Equity = (16,000,000.00 + 16,056,497.85) / 2 = 16,028,248.93  \n • ROE = (Net Profit / Average Owner’s Equity) × 100  \n  – ROE = (56,497.85 / 16,028,248.93) × 100 ≈ 0.3522% → \"0.35%\"\n\nStep 4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio  \n • This ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit)  \n  – Using the values: –2,868,695.86 / 56,497.85 ≈ –50.78  \n • Ratio = \"–50.78\"\n\nStep 5. Net Profit Margin  \n • Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100  \n  – Total Revenue (from income statement) = 547,392.30  \n  – Net Profit = 56,497.85  \n  – Net Profit Margin = (56,497.85 / 547,392.30) × 100 ≈ 10.32% → \"10.32%\"\n\nStep 6. Gross Profit Margin  \n • Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100  \n  – Gross Profit (from income statement) = 194,172.30  \n  – Total Revenue = 547,392.30  \n  – Gross Profit Margin = (194,172.30 / 547,392.30) × 100 ≈ 35.46% → \"35.46%\"\n\nThus, our final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-2868695.86\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"0.30%\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"0.35%\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-50.78\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"10.32%\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"35.46%\"\n  }\n}",
