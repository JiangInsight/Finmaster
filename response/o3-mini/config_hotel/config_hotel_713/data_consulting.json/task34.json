                        "content": "We can derive the ratios step‐by‐step using the provided figures. Note that for the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio we use the average of the beginning and ending “Accounts Receivable”. Since the opening balance was zero, the average is (0 + Ending Accounts Receivable)/2.\n\nStep 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n  = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Current Liabilities)  \n  = (–2,868,695.86) / (5,042,389.63) ≈ –0.569  \n  Rounded result: –0.57\n\nStep 2. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n  = (Total Liabilities) / (Total Owner’s Equity)  \n  Here, total liabilities are the current liabilities (5,042,389.63) and total owner’s equity is 16,056,497.85  \n  = 5,042,389.63 / 16,056,497.85 ≈ 0.314  \n  Rounded result: 0.31\n\nStep 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n  = (Total Revenue) / (Total Assets)  \n  = 547,392.30 / 21,098,887.48 ≈ 0.02595  \n  Rounded result: 0.03\n\nStep 4. Quick Ratio  \n  Quick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable  \n  = 2,179,154.14 + 2,952,150.00 + 9,881.70 + 200,359.99  \n  = 5,341,545.83  \n  Then, Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \n  = 5,341,545.83 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ 1.0588  \n  Rounded result: 1.06\n\nStep 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n  Definition is the same as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n  Thus, the result is –0.57\n\nStep 6. Return on Equity (ROE)  \n  = (Net Profit) / (Total Owner’s Equity)  \n  = 56,497.85 / 16,056,497.85 ≈ 0.003517 → 0.35% (when expressed as a percentage)  \n  Rounded result: 0.35%\n\nStep 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n  Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2  \n  = (0 + 200,359.99) / 2 = 100,179.995  \n  Then, Ratio = (Main Business Revenue) / (Average Accounts Receivable)  \n  = 547,392.30 / 100,179.995 ≈ 5.467  \n  Rounded result: 5.47\n\nNow, putting these together in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.57\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.31\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.06\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.57\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"0.35%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"5.47\"\n  }\n}",
