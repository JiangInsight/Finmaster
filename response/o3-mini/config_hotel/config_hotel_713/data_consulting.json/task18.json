From the balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities (at the end date) is 5,042,389.63.\n\nThe Operating Cash Flow Ratio is calculated as:\n\n  Operating Cash Flow Ratio = (Operating Cash Flow) / (Total Current Liabilities)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n  = (–2,868,695.86) / (5,042,389.63) ≈ –0.569\n\nRounded to two decimals, the ratio is approximately –0.57.\n\nThus, the final answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.57'}}",
