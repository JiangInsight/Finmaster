                        "content": "We begin by extracting the necessary numbers from the balance sheet and cash flow statement (all amounts are taken as of the end date, 2024-02-05):\n\n1. Current Assets and Liabilities:\n • Total Current Assets = 13,190,375.83  \n • Total Current Liabilities = 5,042,389.63  \n\n Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \n  = 13,190,375.83 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ 2.62\n\n2. Quick Ratio (also called Acid Test Ratio):\n Quick Assets = Total Current Assets − Inventory  \n  Inventory = 7,848,830.00  \n  Quick Assets = 13,190,375.83 − 7,848,830.00 = 5,341,545.83  \n\n Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \n  = 5,341,545.83 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ 1.06\n\n3. Debt to Asset Ratio:\n For our purposes, “debt” is taken as the total liabilities. In this balance sheet only current liabilities are given.  \n  Total Liabilities = 5,042,389.63  \n  Total Assets = 21,098,887.48  \n\n Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets  \n  = 5,042,389.63 / 21,098,887.48 ≈ 0.24\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio:\n Total Owner’s Equity is given as 16,056,497.85.  \n Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Owner’s Equity  \n  = 5,042,389.63 / 16,056,497.85 ≈ 0.31\n\n5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:\n Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities from the Cash Flow statement is: –2,868,695.86  \n Using Total Liabilities as the “debt”: 5,042,389.63  \n Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Liabilities  \n  = –2,868,695.86 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ –0.57\n\nThus, our final results are:\n\n{\n  \"Current Ratio\": \"2.62\", \n  \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.06\", \n  \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.24\", \n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.31\", \n  \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.57\"\n}\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.",
