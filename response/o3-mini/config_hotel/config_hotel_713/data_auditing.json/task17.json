Our best inference is that this transaction should have been recorded as a Sale (not Depreciation) and should have “Cash” as the receive_method (not Account Receivable).\n\nBelow is our answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Depreciation\",\n    \"Original date\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded date\": \"\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"\",\n    \"Original payment_method\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": \"\",\n    \"Original quantity\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"\",\n    \"Original price\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded price\": \"\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": \"Cash\",\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Account Receivable\",\n    \"Original amount\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"\",\n    \"Original tax\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded tax\": \"\",\n    \"Original profit\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded profit\": \"\",\n    \"Original Preparer\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": \"\",\n    \"Original Approver\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded Approver\": \"\",\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240124080\"\n  }\n}",
