                        "content": "We need to know the net change in the accounts payable balance. In these transactions only “Purchase” entries that were not paid and that were recorded as “Account Payable” affect this balance. (None of the “Initial…” entries affect it because they only open bank, cash, or asset balances.) In a cash‐flow statement the “Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable” is computed as the ending “Accounts Payable” (since no prior balance is given, we assume zero beginning balance) minus beginning balance.\n\nLooking at the table, we select all purchases for which (a) the Payment/receipt_status is “Unpaid” and (b) the payment_method field is “Account Payable.”\n\nThe relevant rows (with their amounts) are as follows:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001: 72,100.00  \n2. Purchase20231231006: 1,380,000.00  \n3. Purchase20231231008: 244,500.00  \n4. Purchase20231231009: 16,650.00  \n5. Purchase20231231011: 35,850.00  \n6. Purchase20231231013: 454,000.00  \n7. Purchase20231231014: 208,560.00  \n8. Purchase20231231015: 121,440.00  \n9. Purchase20231231016: 154,500.00  \n10. Purchase20231231017: 428,000.00  \n11. Purchase20231231018: 30,300.00  \n12. Purchase20231231019: 400,320.00  \n13. Purchase20231231020: 616,320.00  \n14. Purchase20231231022: 852,480.00  \n\nNow we sum these amounts step‐by‐step:\n\n• 72,100.00 + 1,380,000.00 = 1,452,100.00  \n• 1,452,100.00 + 244,500.00 = 1,696,600.00  \n• 1,696,600.00 + 16,650.00 = 1,713,250.00  \n• 1,713,250.00 + 35,850.00 = 1,749,100.00  \n• 1,749,100.00 + 454,000.00 = 2,203,100.00  \n• 2,203,100.00 + 208,560.00 = 2,411,660.00  \n• 2,411,660.00 + 121,440.00 = 2,533,100.00  \n• 2,533,100.00 + 154,500.00 = 2,687,600.00  \n• 2,687,600.00 + 428,000.00 = 3,115,600.00  \n• 3,115,600.00 + 30,300.00 = 3,145,900.00  \n• 3,145,900.00 + 400,320.00 = 3,546,220.00  \n• 3,546,220.00 + 616,320.00 = 4,162,540.00  \n• 4,162,540.00 + 852,480.00 = 5,015,020.00  \n\nBecause no payments have been made on these “Account Payable” items (i.e. there are no offsetting decreases) and we assume a beginning balance of 0, the net increase in accounts payable is 5,015,020.00.\n\nThus in the cash‐flow statement, the “Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable” item is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"5015020.00\"\n  }\n}",
