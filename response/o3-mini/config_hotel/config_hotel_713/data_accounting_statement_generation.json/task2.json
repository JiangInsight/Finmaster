                        "content": "We look first at the “initial” part of the balance sheet. One of the “initial” rows shows a “Bank deposit” of 5,000,000.00 (the row with type “Bank deposit” on 2023‑12‑31). That is our starting bank deposit.\n\nNext we check the transactions that “use” the bank account. In our data it appears that only some purchase rows were paid by “Bank Transfer” – meaning that the payment was made from the bank deposit. (Other transactions use methods such as “Cash” or “Account Payable” and so do not change the bank‐deposits account immediately.) In our data the following purchase transactions are paid by bank transfer:\n\n1. Purchase20231231002 – amount = 54,950.00  \n2. Purchase20231231004 – amount = 67,900.00  \n3. Purchase20231231005 – amount = 545,000.00  \n4. Purchase20231231010 – amount = 1,380,000.00  \n\nSumming these outflows:\n 54,950.00 + 67,900.00 = 122,850.00  \n 122,850.00 + 545,000.00 = 667,850.00  \n 667,850.00 + 1,380,000.00 = 2,047,850.00\n\nSubtract these from the initial bank deposit:\n\n 5,000,000.00 – 2,047,850.00 = 2,952,150.00\n\nThus the final bank deposit value (the “end value”) is 2,952,150.00.\n\nWe now present our answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"2952150.00\"}}\n```",
