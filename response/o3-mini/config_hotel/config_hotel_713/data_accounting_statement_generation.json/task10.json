                        "content": "We must “build up” our balance‐sheet asset totals only from the items that are to be kept as “property, plant and equipment” (non‐current assets). In this example the only “initial” fixed asset entry is the “Fixed Assets” row – which on 2023‑12‑31 is worth 8,000,000.00. (The other “initial” transactions – for cash and bank – are current.)\n\nThen, later “Purchase” transactions must be “classified” as additions to non‐current assets if (by their product type) they are not “consumable” items (for example, if they are “rooms” or “banquet sets” rather than “meal sets” that are sold as inventory). In our data the purchases come with a product code; by comparing names we decide that only purchases of products whose codes begin with “R” (rooms) or the “Banquet Set” (product F004) are fixed assets while purchases of items such as “Business Meal Set”, “Deluxe Meal Set” or “Quick Meal Set” (products F002, F003 and F001) are not.\n\nIn our table the “Purchase” lines that are counted as non‐current assets are:\n\n• Two purchases of “Luxury Suite” (product R003):\n  – Purchase20231231005: amount = 545,000.00 \n  – Purchase20231231006: amount = 1,380,000.00 \n  – Purchase20231231010: amount = 1,380,000.00  \n    Subtotal for R003 = 545,000.00 + 1,380,000.00 + 1,380,000.00 = 3,305,000.00\n\n• Two purchases of “Business Room” (product R002):\n  – Purchase20231231007: amount = 206,000.00 \n  – Purchase20231231013: amount = 454,000.00 \n    Subtotal for R002 = 206,000.00 + 454,000.00 = 660,000.00\n\n• Three purchases of “Standard Room” (product R001):\n  – Purchase20231231008: amount = 244,500.00 \n  – Purchase20231231012: amount = 427,500.00 \n  – Purchase20231231017: amount = 428,000.00 \n    Subtotal for R001 = 244,500.00 + 427,500.00 + 428,000.00 = 1,100,000.00\n\n• Four purchases of “Banquet Set” (product F004):\n  – Purchase20231231019: amount = 400,320.00 \n  – Purchase20231231020: amount = 616,320.00 \n  – Purchase20231231021: amount = 334,080.00 \n  – Purchase20231231022: amount = 852,480.00 \n    Subtotal for F004 = 400,320.00 + 616,320.00 + 334,080.00 + 852,480.00 = 2,203,200.00\n\nWhen we sum all these “asset‐creating” purchases we get, in addition to the initial fixed assets:\n\n  3,305,000.00 + 660,000.00 + 1,100,000.00 + 2,203,200.00 = 7,268,200.00\n\nAdding this to the initial “Fixed Assets” balance gives a “gross” book‐value for property, plant and equipment of\n\n  8,000,000.00 + 7,268,200.00 = 15,268,200.00\n\nHowever, some depreciation is then charged. In our data there are two “Depreciation” transactions:\n\n  – Depreciation20240101001: 45,746.47 \n  – Depreciation20240201002: 45,741.88 \n\nTheir total is 45,746.47 + 45,741.88 = 91,488.35\n\nSo the “end” (net) value of non‑current assets is\n\n  15,268,200.00 – 91,488.35 = 15,176,711.65\n\nThus the answer we report is as follows.\n\nFinally we present the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"15176711.65\"} }",
