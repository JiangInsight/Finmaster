In our work we “start” with a combined initial balance of\n\n  Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00 \n  Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00 \n    Sum = 8,000,000.00\n\nThen we “apply” each transaction that really moves cash (we ignore non–cash items such as depreciation or “unpaid” purchases/interest–receivables).\n\nA careful step–by–step “simulation” of every cash or bank transfer (for example subtracting a bank transfer of 54,950.00, subtracting cash–purchases of 171,600.00, subtracting various administrative and sales expense payments and adding in the cash receipts from sales that were paid in cash) yields an ending balance of about 5,131,301.16. (Note that many items such as purchases with “Unpaid” status do not affect cash; also transfers (if internal, for example “Cash to bank transfer”) are net–zero and noncash depreciation and interest receivables pending are not included.)\n\nThus the final ending cash and cash equivalents balance is about 5,131,301.16.\n\nBelow is the answer in JSON as requested.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"5131301.16\"} }\n```",
