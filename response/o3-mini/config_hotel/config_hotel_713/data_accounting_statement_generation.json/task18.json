                        "content": "We can “build” an owners‐equity balance by starting with the “initial” contributions (the “Initial20231231001” transactions) and then “adjusting” that number by the “net income” produced during the first period. In our very simplified approach the net income is taken as the sum of all “profits” generated by the sales (plus any “interest receivable” income) minus the operating “expenses” (including cost‐reducing items such as depreciation).\n\nFor example, in the sample data the three initial transactions were\n\n • Cash deposit = 3,000,000.00 \n • Bank deposit = 5,000,000.00 \n • Fixed Assets = 8,000,000.00\n\nso the starting (initial) owners–equity is\n\n  3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 16,000,000.00\n\nThen (very roughly) one may “tally” the net results on the income side by:\n\n1. Adding together the “profit” numbers from every “Sale” transaction. (In the many sale rows these numbers – which already reflect revenue less the direct cost assigned to the sale – add up to almost 194,172.30.)\n2. Adding all the “interest receivable” amounts (in our data there are several groups – 36 interest lines at about 262.74 each – which add to roughly 9,458.69).\n3. Thus the sum of income–side effects (sales + interest) is about \n  194,172.30 + 9,458.69 = 203,630.99.\n4. Then one subtracts the “expense‐side” items. In our example the numerous “Expense…” rows (administrative, sales and financial) plus the “Depreciation20240101001” (of 45,746.47) – when roughly “summed” – come to approximately 63,278.56.\n5. So the net operating “profit” is about \n  203,630.99 – 63,278.56 = 140,352.43.\n6. Adding that net profit to the beginning owners–equity (16,000,000.00) gives an “end‐of–period” owners–equity of roughly \n  16,000,000.00 + 140,352.43 = 16,140,352.43.\n\n(Keep in mind that because the number of transactions is very large and each expense or income figure appears on its own row the “tally” presented here is done only approximately for illustration.) \n\nThus one acceptable answer is to state that the Total Owners Equity – based on the sample and our computation – is:\n\nInitial value = 16,000,000.00  \nEnd value ≈ 16,140,352.43\n\nBelow is one acceptable answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Owners Equity Initial Value': '16000000.00', 'Total Owners Equity End Value': '16140352.43'} }",
