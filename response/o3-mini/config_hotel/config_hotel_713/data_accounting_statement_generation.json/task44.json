In the sample problem (see the example) a transaction with type “Fixed Assets Purchase” (with an amount of 305354.43) was the only one counted. In the new list the first three rows are “Initial” balance entries – for cash, bank and fixed assets. The “Fixed Assets” row (amount 8000000.0) is simply the beginning balance (or an initial entry) rather than a current period “purchase” of fixed assets. All the other “Purchase” transactions are for items such as “Business Meal Set”, “Deluxe Meal Set”, “Luxury Suite”, “Business Room”, “Standard Room”, “Quick Meal Set” and “Banquet Set.” None of these are recorded with a type (or description) that would qualify them as a capital expenditure (a fixed assets purchase) in the cash flow statement.\n\nThus, there is no separate purchase of fixed assets recorded in the period – only the initial fixed assets amount is provided. (Only a “purchase” made during the period would be included in the cash flow statement as a cash outflow for fixed asset acquisition.) \n\nTherefore, the final purchase of fixed assets is zero.\n\nThe final answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"0\"}\n}",
