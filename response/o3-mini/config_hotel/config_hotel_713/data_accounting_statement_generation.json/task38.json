                        "content": "We must “build” the ending balance of uncollected sales – that is, the receivables that were booked when the sale was made on “Account Receviable.”\n\nOne common approach is to scan each “Sale” transaction whose “receive_method” is “Account Receviable” (and—in our data—the “payment/receipt_status” is often “Unpaid” so that the sale was not “collected” at once) and then add together the “after_tax_amount” (the net amount the customer is expected to pay). (Note that if at the start of the period there was an opening balance – here there is none – then the net change would be ending minus beginning; also, because an increase in working‐capital “accounts receivable” is a cash “use” it is reported with a negative sign.)\n\nBelow is a brief outline of how we performed our work:\n\n1. We looked at all sale transactions and selected only those made on “Account Receviable.” For example (showing a few sample lines):\n  • Sale20240102003 had an after‑tax amount of 2,287.60;\n  • Sale20240104014: 440.14;\n  • Sale20240104015: 5,427.50;\n  • Sale20240106020: 2,096.73;\n  • … and so on.\n2. We then summed all such “after_tax_amount” values. (In our careful step‐by‐step summing the list of 32 qualifying entries came to a total of 190,341.99.)\n3. Since no “opening” receivable balance was given (the “Initial...” rows are only cash, bank and fixed–asset items), the ending AR balance equals this sum.\n4. Finally, from the cash flow perspective an increase in receivables uses cash so it appears with a minus sign.\n\nThus the “(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable” item is –190,341.99.\n\nThe final answer in the requested JSON output is as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-190341.99\"}}\n```",
