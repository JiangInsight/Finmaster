(All the other purchase transactions are for items with product‐codes like F002, F003, etc. In this context those are “products” held for sale rather than items recorded as fixed assets.) \n\nHowever, the file does include depreciation entries. In this period we have the following two depreciation entries:\n\n • On 2024‑01‑01, a “Depreciation” entry of 45,746.47  \n • On 2024‑02‑01, a “Depreciation” entry of 45,741.88\n\nThese two depreciation amounts are assumed to be accumulated depreciation on the fixed assets. In order to compute the “net” fixed assets at period‐end we subtract the total depreciation from the initial fixed assets value.\n\nStep by step:\n\n1. Fixed assets initial value = 8,000,000.00  \n2. Total depreciation = 45,746.47 + 45,741.88 = 91,488.35  \n3. Fixed assets net (end) = 8,000,000.00 – 91,488.35 = 7,908,511.65\n\nThus the answer is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"fixed assets net Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"fixed assets net End Value\": \"7908511.65\"\n  }\n}",
