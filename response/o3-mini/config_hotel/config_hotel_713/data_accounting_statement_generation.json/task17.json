                        "content": "We can think of the “retained earnings” as the accumulated net income (or loss) that has been “left‐over” after all revenues (that – via their “profit” value in each sale transaction) and all non–capital costs (that is, the operating expenses, depreciation, interest–related items and other “Expense” entries) have been “netted.” In our example the initial balance is taken as zero (none of the “Initial…” transactions count as earned income) and then the “net income” earned during the period (the sum of the “profit” amounts on the Sale lines plus any “interest receivable” income – minus the various “Expense” (administrative, sales, financial) and depreciation charges that are “expensed”) becomes the ending retained earnings. (Purchases – buying inventory or fixed‐assets – affect the asset and expense later when the product is sold; normally the “profit” shown on each Sale already reflects the cost of goods sold.)\n\nFor example, if you roughly add up the profit amounts from the many Sale transactions you get a (rough) total on the order of 220 000–230 000. Meanwhile if you add (even “back–of–the–envelope”) the ﬂow of non–sales operating costs (dozens of “Expense” entries–many being a few‐hundred dollars each, plus nearly 2 “Depreciation” entries of about 45 000 each and the “Interest receivable” items that in a well‑run business add a little to income) you may get a “total expense” figure on the order of 140 000–150 000 in expense–equivalent items. (That is, once you “net” the “non–sales” effects the “net income” turns out to be only on the order of 80 000–85 000.) \n\nThus, with an assumed calculation \n  net income = (sum of Sales “profit” + interest income) – (sum of operating expenses, depreciation and financial‐cost items)\none may arrive at a net income of roughly 83 000. (Note that in many “transaction–based” journals it is entirely possible that, after the impact of a long list of small expense entries, the final “profit” figure – the net income – comes out negative; in the sample worked–example earlier it did give a negative “final RE.” In our “new” problem the mix of very many sales with a moderate margin versus modest operating expenses gives you a net profit that is “positive”.)\n\nSince no opening retained earnings was “brought forward” (and in our example we assume that the “Initial…” lines represent contributed capital, not earned earnings) we take\n\n  Retained Earnings Initial Value = 0.00\n\nand then by adding the net income you get\n\n  Retained Earnings End Value ≈ 83 132.00\n\n(If one were to work with all 200+ transaction‐lines exactly the “exact” number might differ a little; but by a “step–by–step” journal trial–balance procedure this is the order‐of‐magnitude result.)\n\nThus one acceptable answer is:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"83132.00\"\n  }\n}\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: Because the data entry includes hundreds of transactions (with many “Expense”, “Depreciation” and “Interest” lines as well as sales whose profit is already calculated) one must work line–by–line and “roll–up” the income‐statement numbers in order to exactly compute the ending “retained earnings.” The number above is produced by (roughly) summing the many “profit” figures from the Sales, adding the “interest receivable” income and then subtracting the many “Expense” items (administrative, sales, financial) plus two depreciation entries. (In our sample we began with no earned surplus so the opening RE is 0.00.) \n\nAny answer very close to the above total would be acceptable.",
