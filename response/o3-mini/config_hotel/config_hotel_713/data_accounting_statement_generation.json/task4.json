                        "content": "We must “build up” the AR balance over the period. In our books no opening (initial) entry produces any receivable – all “Initial…” entries are cash, bank, fixed‐asset deposits – so we start with zero AR. Then, every time a “Sale” is recorded with its receive_method set to “Account Receviable” (that is, sales not paid immediately) a receivable is recognized. In addition, whenever we record “Interest Receivables” (whose “receive_method” is shown as “Interest receviable”) these also form part of the overall “accounts receivable” (in many balance sheets interest receivable is a separate line item but here we assume they are aggregated).\n\nWorking step‐by‐step we examined every transaction:\n\n1. Among “Sale” transactions the ones that generate AR (because the “receive_method” is “Account Receviable”) are (with their recorded amount):\n • Sale20240102003: 2,408.00 \n • Sale20240104014: 463.31 \n • Sale20240104015: 5,713.16 \n • Sale20240106020: 2,207.08 \n • Sale20240106021: 2,677.56 \n • Sale20240106022: 220.54 \n • Sale20240107025: 1,059.52 \n • Sale20240107026: 536.48 \n • Sale20240107027: 24,035.49 \n • Sale20240107028: 7,813.36 \n • Sale20240109032: 5,952.08 \n • Sale20240109033: 3,059.84 \n • Sale20240110036: 7,140.32 \n • Sale20240110037: 22,414.14 \n • Sale20240112043: 7,691.16 \n • Sale20240113048: 4,757.44 \n • Sale20240114050: 5,207.72 \n • Sale20240114052: 3,220.03 \n • Sale20240114053: 220.09 \n • Sale20240116057: 6,335.66 \n • Sale20240116059: 6,082.02 \n • Sale20240116060: 4,459.59 \n • Sale20240117061: (not AR because received in cash) – so skip \n • Sale20240118065: 2,604.73 \n • Sale20240122072: 2,848.20 \n • Sale20240122073: 14,061.84 \n • Sale20240125081: 3,928.66 \n • Sale20240128091: 8,589.64 \n • Sale20240131099: 3,693.42 \n • Sale20240131100: 517.14 \n • Sale20240203107: 4,743.14 \n • Sale20240203108: 31,835.68 \n • Sale20240204110: 3,862.95 \n When summed (by careful addition) these “sales‐on‐account” total about 200,360.00.\n \n2. Also, each “Interest Receivables” transaction “creates” an item to be collected. There are 35 such entries. The very first two appear with slightly larger amounts (≈440.11 and 385.56) and every one of the other 33 entries is about 262.74. (33×262.74 ≈8,662.00.) When all 35 are added the “interest receivables” sum about 9,487.64.\n \n3. (No payments reducing AR are recorded.) \n\nThus, starting with zero, the ending balance is the sum of AR arising from sales on account plus the sum from interest receivable:\n  Final AR ≈ 200,360.00 + 9,487.64 = 209,847.64\n\nAccordingly, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"209847.64\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis is our final answer.",
