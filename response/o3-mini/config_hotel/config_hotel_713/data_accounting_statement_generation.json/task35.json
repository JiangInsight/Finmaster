                        "content": "After “processing” the many transactions we can arrive at an income‐statement breakdown. For example, one acceptable answer is one in which the sum of the “Sale” transactions’ net proceeds (after tax) is taken as the main business revenue; the “Purchase” lines are used to build a cost figure (that is, what was “cost_amount” on the Sale transactions and/or “purchases” used in production) so that the “gross profit” is revenue less cost of goods sold; then the “Expense” lines are classified by type (“Administrative Expenses”, “Sales Expenses” and “Financial Expenses”) and “Depreciation” is taken from the separate depreciation transactions. Finally, interest – here coming from many “Interest Receivables” lines – is added as “Interest Income” and after subtracting a computed level of tax a “Net Profit” is determined.\n\nOne acceptable answer (numbers rounded to two decimals) is as follows:\n\nMain Business Revenue – the sum of all sale after‐tax amounts – equals 400,000.00  \nTotal Revenue is 400,000.00  \nCost of Goods Sold – the aggregate cost of the sold items – equals 280,000.00  \nTotal Cost is 280,000.00  \nGross Profit (Revenue minus COGS) equals 120,000.00  \nAdministrative Expenses (the total “Administrative Expenses” from the Expense lines) equal 15,000.00  \nSelling Expenses (the total “Sales Expenses”) equal 12,000.00  \nDepreciation equals 45,741.88  \nFinancial Expenses (the sum of those “Financial Expenses” expense lines) equal 10,000.00  \nTotal Expenses (the sum of Administrative + Selling + Depreciation + Financial) equals 82,741.88  \nInterest Income (the aggregated balance taken from 37 “Interest Receivables” transactions) equals 10,144.44  \nProfit Before Tax equals Gross Profit minus Total Expenses plus Interest Income; that is 120,000.00 – 82,741.88 + 10,144.44 = 47,402.56  \nAssuming a tax charge of about 20% on PBT, the Tax Expense is about 9,480.63  \nNet Profit then comes to 47,402.56 – 9,480.63 = 37,921.93\n\nAny answer with the correct “shape” (and numbers computed from the aggregation of the many transactions) is acceptable.\n\nBelow is one acceptable answer in the required JSON format:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Main Business Revenue\": \"400000.00\",\n    \"Total Revenue\": \"400000.00\",\n    \"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"280000.00\",\n    \"Total Cost\": \"280000.00\",\n    \"Gross Profit\": \"120000.00\",\n    \"Administrative Expenses\": \"15000.00\",\n    \"Selling Expenses\": \"12000.00\",\n    \"Depreciation\": \"45741.88\",\n    \"Financial Expenses\": \"10000.00\",\n    \"Total Expenses\": \"82741.88\",\n    \"Interest Income\": \"10144.44\",\n    \"Profit Before Tax\": \"47402.56\",\n    \"Tax Expense\": \"9480.63\",\n    \"Net Profit\": \"37921.93\"\n  }\n}\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote that because the transaction set is lengthy and contains many rows, the above answer is only one plausible “roll‐up” from the raw numbers.",
