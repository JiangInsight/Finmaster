                        "content": "We need to “pick out” only those transactions that relate to non‐current (investment) asset purchases and sales. In our case (and as in many ﬁnancial reporting rules) only “Fixed Assets” and asset‐purchases that are not for resale are treated as investing activities.\n\nLooking at the table the only clearly “investing” items are the one “Fixed Assets” entry and the purchases that do not “move” in operating (sale) transactions. (All of the many many “Purchase” lines for items that are later “Sold” are taken as inventory purchases – i.e. operating activity.) In our data one set of Purchase lines stands out: those for “Banquet Set” with product id “F004.” (Notice that no Sale transaction later involves F004; hence we assume these items are held as long‐term assets rather than inventory.) \n\nThe investing‐related cash flows are therefore:\n\n1. The Fixed Assets acquisition on 2023‑12‑31: 8,000,000.0 (cash outflow)  \n2. Purchases of Banquet Set (F004):  \n • Purchase20231231019: 400,320.0  \n • Purchase20231231020: 616,320.0  \n • Purchase20231231021: 334,080.0  \n • Purchase20231231022: 852,480.0\n\nSince these are capital expenditures the cash “paid” is an outflow; we sum them up (and then add the Fixed Assets outflow).\n\nStep 1. Sum of the Banquet Set purchasing amounts:  \n 400,320.0 + 616,320.0 = 1,016,640.0  \n 1,016,640.0 + 334,080.0 = 1,350,720.0  \n 1,350,720.0 + 852,480.0 = 2,203,200.0\n\nStep 2. Total investing outflow:  \n 8,000,000.0 + 2,203,200.0 = 10,203,200.0\n\nBecause these are cash outflows, the net cash flow from investing activities is negative.\n\nThus, the final answer is –10,203,200.0.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-10203200.0\"} }\n```",
