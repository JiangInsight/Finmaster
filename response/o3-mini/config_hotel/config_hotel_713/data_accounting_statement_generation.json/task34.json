                        "content": "We can “build” an income‐statement by first “picking out” those transactions that affect operating income. (This is only one way to “do” the bookkeeping.)\n\nIn our simplified example the idea is to add up the “profit” amounts that come from the Sale transactions and add to that any “other income” (here the Interest Receivables which appear as positive amounts) and then subtract all “operating expense” items—that is, all Expense‐type (whether Sales or Administrative), plus Depreciation. (Purchases, Initial deposits, Fixed Assets and Transfers are “balance‐sheet” items and are not “incurred” as expenses in the income statement.) \n\nLet’s illustrate briefly with our “problem to solve” data:\n\n1. Total “Sales profit” amounts (taken directly from the “profit” column on Sale rows) sum to about 228280.81.\n2. Total “interest income” (all rows of type “Interest Receivables”) sum to about 9356.21.\n3. Total expenses (all Expense rows – Sales Expenses plus Administrative Expenses) sum to about 27748.02.\n4. Total depreciation (all rows of type “Depreciation”) sum to about 91488.35.\n\nThen the net profit is computed as\n\n  Net Profit = (Sales profit + Interest income) – (Expenses + Depreciation).\n\nThat is,\n\n  Net Profit ≈ (228280.81 + 9356.21) – (27748.02 + 91488.35)\n        ≈ 237637.02 – 119236.37\n        ≈ 118400.65\n\nThus, the final net profit is about 118400.65.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"118400.65\"}}\n``` \n\n(Notes on the calculation: the very long list of transactions was sorted by type so that only revenue‐side “Sale” entries and “Interest Receivables” are included on the credit side while all “Expense” and “Depreciation” items are deducted. Purchases, Initial deposits, Fixed Assets and Transfers are balance‐sheet items and are not “expensed” on the Income Statement.)",
