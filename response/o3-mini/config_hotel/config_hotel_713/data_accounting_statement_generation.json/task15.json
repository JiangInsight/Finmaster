                        "content": "We must first decide which transactions “build” your liabilities balance. In our case the only “initial” entries (those with type “Initial20231231001”) are for cash deposit, bank deposit and fixed assets. These are all asset‐type items. (No “initial” liability entry is given.) Therefore the liabilities balance at the beginning (“Total Liabilities Initial Value”) is zero.\n\nThen we scan the “Purchase…” transactions. (Usually purchases are entered and, when the status is “Unpaid” and the payment method is “Account Payable”, the amount is added to your balance‐sheet “liabilities” – that is, amounts you owe.) In the provided data the following Purchase rows have “Unpaid” as their “payment/receipt_status” and their “payment_method” is “Account Payable”: \n\n1. Purchase20231231001: amount 72,100.0  \n2. Purchase20231231006: amount 1,380,000.0  \n3. Purchase20231231008: amount 244,500.0  \n4. Purchase20231231009: amount 16,650.0  \n5. Purchase20231231011: amount 35,850.0  \n6. Purchase20231231013: amount 454,000.0  \n7. Purchase20231231014: amount 208,560.0  \n8. Purchase20231231015: amount 121,440.0  \n9. Purchase20231231016: amount 154,500.0  \n10. Purchase20231231017: amount 428,000.0  \n11. Purchase20231231018: amount 30,300.0  \n12. Purchase20231231019: amount 400,320.0  \n13. Purchase20231231020: amount 616,320.0  \n14. Purchase20231231022: amount 852,480.0\n\nNow, add these in sequence:\n• 72,100.0  \n  + 1,380,000.0 = 1,452,100.0  \n  + 244,500.0 = 1,696,600.0  \n  + 16,650.0 = 1,713,250.0  \n  + 35,850.0 = 1,749,100.0  \n  + 454,000.0 = 2,203,100.0  \n  + 208,560.0 = 2,411,660.0  \n  + 121,440.0 = 2,533,100.0  \n  + 154,500.0 = 2,687,600.0  \n  + 428,000.0 = 3,115,600.0  \n  + 30,300.0 = 3,145,900.0  \n  + 400,320.0 = 3,546,220.0  \n  + 616,320.0 = 4,162,540.0  \n  + 852,480.0 = 5,015,020.0\n\nThus, after all transactions the liabilities “accumulated” through unpaid purchases sum to 5,015,020.0.\n\nSo the final balance sheet “liabilities” (that is, the Total Liabilities End Value) equals 5,015,020.00. \n\nThus our solution in the requested json format is as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"5015020.00\"\n  }\n}",
