(Other “Purchase” transactions you see in the listing are for items like Business Meal Sets, Room items, etc. They are not treated as fixed assets.) We do see depreciation entries that reduce the fixed‐asset value. In this file there are two Depreciation transactions:\n • Depreciation20240101001 has amount 45,746.47.\n • Depreciation20240201002 has amount 45,741.88.\n\nThese two together reduce the fixed assets by:\n  45,746.47 + 45,741.88 = 91,488.35\n\nThus, the ending fixed assets are computed as:\n  8,000,000.00 – 91,488.35 = 7,908,511.65\n\nWe now present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"7908511.65\"\n  }\n}",
