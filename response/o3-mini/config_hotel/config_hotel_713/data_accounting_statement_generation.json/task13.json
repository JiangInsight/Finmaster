In these books the “opening” (initial) entry is made by the “Initial” transactions (which here do not include a tax component), and then each sale entry “collects” a little sales tax (in our file the “tax_amount” column on the Sale rows represents the tax collected on that sale). In our books the “taxes payable” liability starts at zero and is then increased by every sale’s tax_amount (and – if we had input tax credits – we would subtract those; here none is given). (The example problem in our workbook produced an “end” balance near 271550.92.) \n\nIn the new problem the only rows having a non‐empty “tax_amount” are all the sales. (For example, one sale has an amount of 1397.44 and a tax_amount of 69.87 – about 5% of the sale—which is true for every sale row.) If you add up the “tax_amount” of every Sale transaction in the table the total comes out to be about 27,369.63. There is no “opening tax” entry so the tax payable “initial” is zero.\n\nThus, after processing all the sale transactions the “Taxes Payable End Value” is the sum of all the tax amounts collected, approximately 27,369.63.\n\nAccordingly, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"27369.63\"\n  }\n}",
