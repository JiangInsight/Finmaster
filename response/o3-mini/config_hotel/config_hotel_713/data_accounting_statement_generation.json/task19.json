                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” this task by “building” the right–side of the accounting equation. (In a full “double–entry” system the balance–sheet “right–side” is “liabilities and owners equity” which must equal total assets.) In our example the various “Initial” entries (which in our problem come from the “Initial20231231001” rows) are used to “start” the balance–sheet. Then as business “runs” one “earns profit” (or loses money) and that “profit” is “retained” (or “lost”), so that the “end value” of liabilities and owners equity equals the initial amount plus the net effect of the operating transactions.\n\nIn our sample from an earlier task the three “Initial” entries were\n\n  Cash deposit = 3,000,000.00  \n  Bank deposit = 5,000,000.00  \n  Fixed Assets = 5,000,000.00  \n  \nso their sum is 13,000,000.00. (That sample answer then gave an end figure of 13,216,409.49 so that the “net result” of operations contributed roughly 216,409.49 of “profit/retained‐earnings”.)\n\nIn our problem the “Initial” rows are\n\n  Cash deposit = 3,000,000.00  \n  Bank deposit = 5,000,000.00  \n  Fixed Assets = 8,000,000.00  \n \nso the initial “total” is\n\n  3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 8,000,000.00 = 16,000,000.00\n\nThe many “Sale” transactions include a column “profit” (already computed on a per–transaction basis as “after tax amount minus cost amount”). When one adds up the profit amounts from all the Sale rows (there are 89 such rows) one obtains a total sales–profit of roughly 187,118.53. In addition the “Interest Receivables” appear as another type of operating revenue; when we sum up all those many “Interest” transactions (with amounts such as 440.11, 385.56 and then many at 262.74) we get about 9,496.14. (In our system these interest “revenues” are earned even when they have not been paid; they are “receivables” that add to the asset–side but also will be reflected on the liabilities/owners equity side via retained earnings.) Meanwhile many “Expense” type transactions are recorded – from administrative expenses to sales expenses – and also there are non–cash “Depreciation” entries (here two of them: 45,746.47 and 45,741.88, totaling about 91,488.35). When we add up all the “cash expenses” (actually the raw expense entries not already “closed‐in” to the sale profit numbers) we obtain about 20,921.21. (One must note that since the individual sale “profit” amounts were computed as sale “after–tax amount” less “cost amount”, their sum does not include the many other operating “expenses” that had an effect on net –income.) Thus the “overall net effect” running “through retained earnings” can be approximated by\n\n  (net sale profit) + (interest revenues) – (other operating expenses and depreciation)  \n   ≈ 187,118.53 + 9,496.14 – (20,921.21 + 91,488.35)  \n   ≈ 196,614.67 – 112,409.56  \n   ≈ 84,205.11\n\nThat is, operations have produced roughly 84,205.11 of net income (which eventually is “retained” and shows up on the right–side). (Other effects such as changes in unpaid purchase liabilities, inventory versus cost–of–goods–sold, etc. have been “netted out” in the profit numbers.) \n\nThus the final “total liabilities and owners equity” value is\n\n  Initial value + Net income  \n   = 16,000,000.00 + 84,205.11  \n   ≈ 16,084,205.11\n\nFor the final answer we then report, rounding to two decimals:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n     \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\",\n     \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"16084205.11\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote that in a full computerized accounting system every purchase, expense, depreciation and interest transaction is posted with its debit (affecting an asset or expense) and credit (affecting liability or owner’s equity) so that when you “close the books” the net change in retained earnings equals net income – and that is what our “end‐value” represents.",
