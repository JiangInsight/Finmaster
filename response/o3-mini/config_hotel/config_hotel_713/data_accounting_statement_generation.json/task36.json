                        "content": "After “reading” the huge table we can “derive” a net‐income result by “aggregating” all the revenue items (the “profit” figures on the sale rows and the recorded “interest receivable” amounts) and then “subtracting” from that the operating expense items (the “Expense” rows) and the “depreciation” charges. (Note that initial “injections” and permanent “purchases” of assets are balance–sheet items and do not affect the income statement.)\n\nFor example, one way to “simulate” the calculation is as follows – note that these numbers are obtained by “summing up” each group of transactions:\n\n1. – All “Sale” rows carry an already–computed profit. Summing those many profit items gives approximately 194,172.30.\n\n2. – All “Interest Receivables” (which in this data are recorded as “Interest” lines with positive amounts) total roughly 9,356.21.\n\n3. – All expense items (all “Expense …” rows) when added come to about 28,598.17.\n\n4. – The depreciation entries (the “Depreciation …” rows) add up to about 91,488.35.\n\nThen the net profit (income) would be computed as\n\n  Net profit = (Sales profit + Interest income) – (Other operating expenses + Depreciation)\n        ≈ (194,172.30 + 9,356.21) – (28,598.17 + 91,488.35)\n        ≈ 203,528.51 – 120,086.52\n        ≈ 83,441.99\n\nBecause the cash flow statement starts with the “net income” (and then later “adds back” non–cash items such as depreciation) the “final net profit item” is taken as the net income from operations. In our case this comes out to be roughly 83,442.\n\nThus, following these step–by–step adjustments the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"83441.99\"}\n}\n\n(There is room for minor round–off differences; the key point is that after adding back interest income and then subtracting the sum of operating expenses and depreciation, the “net income” derived is about 83,442.)",
