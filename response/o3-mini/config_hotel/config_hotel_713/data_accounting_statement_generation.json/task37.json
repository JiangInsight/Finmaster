In the given data there are two entries that have their “type” set to “Depreciation.” One is recorded on 2024‑01‑01 with an amount of 45746.47 and the later one is recorded on 2024‑02‑01 with an amount of 45741.88. Since the cash flow statement is compiled with the final (most recent) depreciation entry to adjust the fixed asset value and recognize the expense over the period, the final depreciation item is the one from 2024‑02‑01.\n\nThus, the final depreciation item amount is 45741.88.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Depreciation\": \"45741.88\"}}\n```",
