                        "content": "We need to “build” the balance‐sheet “current liabilities” from the set of transactions. In our books the only transactions that add to current liabilities are those “Purchase” entries that have not yet been paid (that is, they are “Unpaid” and they use a “non‐cash” payment method such as “Account Payable”). (Other transactions – for example deposits with an “Initial” label, expenses, depreciation, or “Interest Receivables” – are not part of the current liabilities.) \n\nStep 1. Identify the “Purchase” transactions with status “Unpaid” (which indicates we have not yet settled the amount):\n\n• Purchase20231231001 – Amount = 72,100.0        (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n• Purchase20231231006 – Amount = 1,380,000.0     (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n• Purchase20231231008 – Amount = 244,500.0      (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n• Purchase20231231009 – Amount = 16,650.0       (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n• Purchase20231231011 – Amount = 35,850.0       (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n• Purchase20231231013 – Amount = 454,000.0      (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n• Purchase20231231014 – Amount = 208,560.0      (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n• Purchase20231231015 – Amount = 121,440.0      (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n• Purchase20231231016 – Amount = 154,500.0      (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n• Purchase20231231017 – Amount = 428,000.0      (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n• Purchase20231231018 – Amount = 30,300.0       (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n• Purchase20231231019 – Amount = 400,320.0      (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n• Purchase20231231020 – Amount = 616,320.0      (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n• Purchase20231231022 – Amount = 852,480.0      (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n  \n(Other “Purchase” entries marked “Paid” or transactions of other types are not included.)\n\nStep 2. Sum up these “unpaid” purchase amounts:\n\n 72,100.0  \n+ 1,380,000.0 = 1,452,100.0  \n+ 244,500.0  = 1,696,600.0  \n+ 16,650.0  = 1,713,250.0  \n+ 35,850.0  = 1,749,100.0  \n+ 454,000.0  = 2,203,100.0  \n+ 208,560.0  = 2,411,660.0  \n+ 121,440.0  = 2,533,100.0  \n+ 154,500.0  = 2,687,600.0  \n+ 428,000.0  = 3,115,600.0  \n+ 30,300.0  = 3,145,900.0  \n+ 400,320.0  = 3,546,220.0  \n+ 616,320.0  = 4,162,540.0  \n+ 852,480.0  = 5,015,020.0\n\nThus the ending (final) total for our current liabilities is 5,015,020.0.\n\nStep 3. Determining the “initial” current liabilities value:\nIn our set the “Initial20231231001” transactions are used to record the opening balances (cash, bank, fixed assets). They do not include any liability entry. So the liabilities on the opening balance sheet are nil – i.e. 0.00.\n\nSo our answer is:\n\n Total Current Liabilities Initial Value = 0.00  \n Total Current Liabilities End Value   = 5,015,020.00  \n\nFinally, we return the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\nBelow is our final answer:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"5015020.00\"} }",
