                        "content": "We need to “build up” the income‐statement’s “expenses” item from the transaction data. In our table the “expense” entries appear as rows whose “type” begins with “Expense” (for example Administrative Expenses or Sales Expenses) as well as rows reporting “Depreciation” (which is included in expenses). (Transactions such as “Purchase”, “Initial…” and “Sale” are not expense items; and although some rows concern “Interest Receivables” they do not fall into expenses for the income statement.) \n\nThus, we scan the table and add up each amount on rows having a type beginning with “Expense” or “Depreciation.” (We now describe the process in brief, showing the key rows and then summing them.)\n\nFor example, from our data we obtain the following expense amounts (all numbers as provided in the “amount” column):\n\n• Expense20240101001 – Administrative Expenses: 420.61  \n• Expense20240101001 – Sales Expenses: 912.25  \n• Depreciation20240101001 – Depreciation: 45746.47  \n\n• Expense20240102001 – Sales Expenses (first row): 593.54  \n• Expense20240102001 – Sales Expenses (second row): 742.01  \n\n• Expense20240103001 – Sales Expenses: 619.55  \n• Expense20240103001 – Sales Expenses: 911.56  \n\n• Expense20240104001 – Sales Expenses: 505.90  \n• Expense20240104001 – Administrative Expenses: 651.53  \n\n• Expense20240105001 – Administrative Expenses: 103.43  \n\n• Expense20240106001 – Sales Expenses: 467.46  \n• Expense20240106001 – Administrative Expenses: 579.58  \n\n• Expense20240107001 – Administrative Expenses: 816.38  \n\n• Expense20240108001 – Administrative Expenses: 832.10  \n• Expense20240108001 – Sales Expenses: 100.60  \n\n• Expense20240109001 – Sales Expenses: 531.58  \n\n• Expense20240110001 – Sales Expenses: 642.55  \n\n• Expense20240111001 – Sales Expenses: 950.15  \n\n• Expense20240112001 – Sales Expenses: 400.21  \n• Expense20240112001 – Administrative Expenses: 631.59  \n\n• Expense20240113001 – Administrative Expenses: 846.84  \n\n• Expense20240114001 – Sales Expenses: 609.30  \n\n• Expense20240115001 – Administrative Expenses: 771.36  \n\n• Expense20240116001 – Administrative Expenses: 252.96  \n\n• Expense20240117001 – Administrative Expenses: 589.17  \n\n• Expense20240118001 – Sales Expenses: 495.80  \n• Expense20240118001 – Administrative Expenses: 273.94  \n\n• Expense20240119001 – Administrative Expenses: 472.82  \n\n• Expense20240120001 – Financial Expenses: 156.67  \n• Expense20240120001 – Administrative Expenses: 750.83  \n\n• Expense20240121001 – Administrative Expenses: 151.61  \n\n• Expense20240122001 – Administrative Expenses: 320.56  \n• Expense20240122001 – Sales Expenses: 397.63  \n\n• Expense20240123001 – Sales Expenses: 128.65  \n• Expense20240123001 – Administrative Expenses: 987.99  \n\n• Expense20240124001 – Administrative Expenses: 405.22  \n\n• Expense20240125001 – Administrative Expenses: 463.68  \n\n• Expense20240126001 – Sales Expenses: 790.94  \n• Expense20240126001 – Sales Expenses: 438.39  \n\n• Expense20240127001 – Financial Expenses: 971.17  \n\n• Expense20240128001 – Sales Expenses: 593.98  \n\n• Expense20240129001 – Administrative Expenses: 228.46  \n• Expense20240129001 – Sales Expenses: 212.96  \n\n• Expense20240130001 – Administrative Expenses: 123.24  \n• Expense20240130001 – Sales Expenses: 864.48  \n\n• Expense20240131001 – Financial Expenses: 451.00  \n\n• Expense20240201001 – Administrative Expenses: 231.23  \n• Expense20240201001 – Sales Expenses: 531.77  \n\n• Depreciation20240201002 – Depreciation: 45741.88  \n\n• Expense20240202001 – Administrative Expenses: 857.74  \n\n• Expense20240203001 – Sales Expenses: 578.63  \n\n• Expense20240204001 – Financial Expenses: 641.78  \n\n• Expense20240205001 – Sales Expenses: 703.14  \n• Expense20240205001 – Sales Expenses: 991.65  \n\nWhen we add all these figures step‐by‐step we get a sum of  \n\n  120186.52\n\nThus, the final “Total Expenses” item on the income statement is 120186.52.\n\nThe answer in the requested format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Expenses\": \"120186.52\"\n  }\n}",
