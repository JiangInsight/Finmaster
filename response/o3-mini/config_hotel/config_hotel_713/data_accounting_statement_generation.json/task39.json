                        "content": "We have to “net‐up” all the interest receivable transactions that affect the interest receivable balance. (In a cash flow statement an increase in a current asset is reported as a use of cash – so a rising interest receivable balance is subtracted.) In our data the only rows that affect interest receivable are those whose type is “Interest Receivables”. (There is no beginning‐balance provided so we regard the “net change” over the period as the sum of all the posted interest receivable amounts.) \n\nStep 1. Identify the “Interest Receivables” rows. In this data the following 36 transactions are found:\n\n1. Interest20240101001:          amount = 440.10945  \n2. Interest20240102002:          amount = 385.56135  \n3. Interest20240103003:          amount = 385.56135  \n\nThen transactions 4–36 (a total of 33 entries) each have an amount equal to 262.74135. (None of these entries are “negative”.)\n\nStep 2. Compute the sum.\n\n• Sum of the first three items =  \n  440.10945 + 385.56135 + 385.56135  \n         = 1211.23215\n\n• For the remaining 33 entries:  \n  33 × 262.74135 = 8407.72320 (approximately)\n\n• Total redone‐sum = 1211.23215 + 8407.72320 = 9618.95535\n\nStep 3. In a cash‐flow presentation an increase in interest receivables is a “use” of cash (i.e. it reduces operating cash); therefore the change is reported with a negative sign. Rounding to two decimals, the net change is –9618.96.\n\nThus the final interest receivable item to be reported is:\n  (Decrease) or “(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable”: –9618.96\n\nThe answer in the expected json format is as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-9618.96\"\n  }\n}",
