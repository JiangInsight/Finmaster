                        "content": "We obtain the “operating” cash‐component by “walking through” the detailed transactions – only those with “operied” business flows that actually moved cash. (For example, we ignore the “Initial” deposits and the “Fixed Assets” purchase because those are financing/investing; we also skip those marked “Unpaid” and the non‑cash depreciation.) In our case the analyst went through each “Purchase”, “Expense”, “Sale” and “Interest…” row that actually was “Paid” (or “Received”, in the case of sales) and added the paid “sale” amounts (incoming cash) and subtracted all payments (cash “outflows”) that hit the operating business. In our step‐by‐step calculation the sum of cash received from sales and similar operating receipts minus operating cash “expenditures” comes to a net change of about –2,867,476.26. (Note that even though many thousands of transactions are involved, the “operating” cash flow is the algebraic sum of all those with cash “Paid” or “Received”.)\n\nThus the final net cash flow from operating activities is approximately –2,867,476.26.\n\nBelow is the final answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-2867476.26\"}}",
