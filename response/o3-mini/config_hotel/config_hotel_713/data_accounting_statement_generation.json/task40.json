                        "content": "We can “re‐construct” the inventory balance by “tracking” the cost flows. In our case the idea is to note that when a business buys items the inventory “cost” increases by the purchase amount while when the business sells some items (using the inventory costing method, here the sale’s “cost amount” is the value of that inventory outflow) the inventory “balance” is reduced. (In a typical indirect cash flow statement the change in inventory is “increased (or decreased)” from beginning to ending balance; an increase “uses cash” and is shown with a minus sign.) \n\nIn this problem the purchases (the “Purchase” type records) total an aggregate cost of\n\n  PurchaseTotal = \n    72100.0 + 54950.0 + 171600.0 + 67900.0 + 545000.0 + 1380000.0 + 206000.0 +\n    244500.0 + 16650.0 + 1380000.0 + 35850.0 + 427500.0 + 454000.0 + 208560.0 +\n    121440.0 + 154500.0 + 428000.0 + 30300.0 + 400320.0 + 616320.0 +\n    334080.0 + 852480.0 = 8,202,050.0\n\nThe “Sale” type records carry a “cost_amount” (that is, the cost of the inventory items that were sold). Adding those “cost_amount” values over all Sale entries we find a total cost of goods sold (COGS) of about\n\n  SalesCostTotal = 345,460.0\n\n(One obtains this sum by “grouping” all the sale records – for example, one set of sales is on January 2nd, another on January 3rd, etc. – and summing the “cost_amount” column from each sale record.)\n\nThen the ending‐inventory balance is (assuming a zero beginning balance) calculated by\n\n  Ending Inventory = Total Purchases – Cost of Sales \n    = 8,202,050.0 – 345,460.0 \n    = 7,856,590.0\n\nBecause an increase in inventory represents a use of cash (and thus appears with a “negative” sign on the cash flow statement) the “(Increase) Decrease in Inventory” item is\n\n  –7,856,590.00\n\nBelow is the answer in the required json format.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-7856590.00\"} }\n```",
