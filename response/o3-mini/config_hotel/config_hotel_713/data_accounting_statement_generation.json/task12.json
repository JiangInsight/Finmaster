                        "content": "We first need to “build” the accounts‐payable balance from the purchase transactions that increase a liability (i.e. those purchases that were recorded as “Unpaid” via the “Account Payable” payment method). In this problem no opening (initial) balance for Accounts Payable is provided (the “Initial…” rows are for other asset types), so the opening AP is 0.00.\n\nThen we scan through the “Purchase” transactions and add only those whose payment method is “Account Payable” and that are marked as “Unpaid.” In our data these are:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001 – amount = 72,100.00  \n2. Purchase20231231006 – amount = 1,380,000.00  \n3. Purchase20231231008 – amount = 244,500.00  \n4. Purchase20231231009 – amount = 16,650.00  \n5. Purchase20231231011 – amount = 35,850.00  \n6. Purchase20231231013 – amount = 454,000.00  \n7. Purchase20231231014 – amount = 208,560.00  \n8. Purchase20231231015 – amount = 121,440.00  \n9. Purchase20231231016 – amount = 154,500.00  \n10. Purchase20231231017 – amount = 428,000.00  \n11. Purchase20231231018 – amount = 30,300.00  \n12. Purchase20231231019 – amount = 400,320.00  \n13. Purchase20231231020 – amount = 616,320.00  \n14. Purchase20231231022 – amount = 852,480.00\n\nAdding these, we obtain the final outstanding Accounts Payable balance:\n\n  72,100  \n+ 1,380,000 = 1,452,100  \n+   244,500 = 1,696,600  \n+    16,650 = 1,713,250  \n+    35,850 = 1,749,100  \n+   454,000 = 2,203,100  \n+   208,560 = 2,411,660  \n+   121,440 = 2,533,100  \n+   154,500 = 2,687,600  \n+   428,000 = 3,115,600  \n+    30,300 = 3,145,900  \n+   400,320 = 3,546,220  \n+   616,320 = 4,162,540  \n+   852,480 = 5,015,020\n\nThus, since no beginning AP existed, the Accounts Payable on the balance sheet would read:\n\n• Accounts Payable Initial Value: 0.00  \n• Accounts Payable End Value: 5,015,020.00\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accounts Payable End Value': '5015020.00'}}",
