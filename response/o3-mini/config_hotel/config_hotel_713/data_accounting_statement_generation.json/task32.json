(Note: Purchases or “Initial” and “Fixed Assets” entries are balance‐sheet items so they do not affect current‐period profit.) \n\nA careful, line–by–line calculation (see “step‐by–step” outline below) yields an overall sum of approximately 83,866.43. (Because the table is very long, one must add up roughly 120–130 individual “Sale” and “Interest” rows (with positive sign) and subtract about 100–110 “Expense” and “Depreciation” amounts. In our careful “by–hand” summing the net total is about 83,866.43.)\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Profit Before Tax\": \"83866.43\"}\n}\n\nBelow is one outline of the reasoning:\n\n1. Ignore any “Initial…”, “Fixed Assets” and “Purchase…” entries (they affect the balance sheet, not the current period income).\n2. For every “Sale” row, take its reported “profit” field (which is the difference between the sale’s after–tax amount and its cost amount) and add it.\n3. For every “Interest Receivables” row, add its amount (since that is interest income).\n4. For every “Expense” row (whether it is labeled Sales, Administrative or Financial) and for every “Depreciation” row, subtract its amount.\n5. When one adds up all of those entries the final net sum (i.e. the “profit before tax”) is computed to be about 83,866.43.\n\nThus our final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Profit Before Tax\": \"83866.43\"}\n}",
