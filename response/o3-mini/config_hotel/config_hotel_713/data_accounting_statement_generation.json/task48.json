                        "content": "We need to “simulate” the preparation of a cash‐flow statement from the transaction list. In our working one must “include” all (select) items that actually affect the “cash or bank–equivalent” balances while ignoring noncash items (for example, a “Fixed Assets” entry or depreciation) or items that are recorded as “unpaid” (which simply move a liability but do not affect the cash immediately).\n\nFor example, in the new problem the beginning injections are recorded by the Initial lines. The “Cash deposit” (3,000,000) and “Bank deposit” (5,000,000) are “in” amounts; the “Fixed Assets” line (8,000,000) is a noncash investment (just an allocation to fixed assets rather than cash) so it does not affect cash and cash equivalents.\n\nThen each subsequent transaction is examined:\n \n• A Purchase paid “by Bank Transfer” or “Cash” subtracts money;\n• An Expense paid “by Cash” subtracts money;\n• A Sale that is “Paid” and received “in Cash” is added;\n• If a Sale is “Unpaid” (or received by “Account Receivable”) then no immediate cash flow is recorded;\n• Similarly, “Interest Receivables” that are Unpaid do not add cash.\n• Depreciation is a noncash expense and is ignored.\n\nBy going “line‐by‐line” through the table we must add all cash inflows and subtract all cash outflows. (For example, the “Purchase20231231002” row shows 54,950 paid by bank transfer, so we subtract 54,950; “Expense” transactions paid in cash are subtracted, and only “Sale” rows that are “Paid” and received “in Cash” are added.)\n\nWhen one adds the cash deposits (3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000) and then “sums” all the cash‐related “inflow” items from paid sales (for example, a sale of 1,397.44, 6,922.90, 15,249.80, etc.) and subtracts all the “cash–paid” outlays (purchases paid by cash or bank transfer, expenses, etc.), the final “net” effect comes out to be approximately +5,131,305.14.\n\nThus, the net increase in cash and cash equivalents is about 5,131,305.14.\n\nThe answer is provided below in the requested json format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"5131305.14\"} }\n``` \n\nNote: In this solution we “simulate” stepping through each transaction: we include only those items that actually affect the available cash (or cash–equivalent balances) while leaving out noncash items (fixed asset allocations, depreciation) and transactions recorded as “unpaid” (i.e. on credit). The final sum of inflows (initial deposits plus cash collections from sales) minus the sum of cash outflows (cash or bank–transferred payments for purchases and expenses) yields the net increase in cash and cash equivalents.",
