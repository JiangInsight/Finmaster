                        "content": "We must “build up” the inventory balance by first “stocking‐up” (i.e. all the purchases that add “inventory items”) and then “using up” (i.e. subtracting the cost of goods sold reported on each sale). In this case no opening (beginning) stock is given so we assume the initial inventory for trade goods is zero.\n\nStep 1. – Sum up all purchase amounts (only “Purchase” rows that refer to products such as Business Meal Set, Deluxe Meal Set, Luxury Suite, Business Room, Standard Room, Quick Meal Set, Banquet Set – i.e. our inventory items). (All “PurchaseXXXXXXX” rows contribute.) Using the table we add up each purchase – for example, the list is\n\n • Purchase20231231001:   72100.0  \n • Purchase20231231002:   54950.0  \n • Purchase20231231003:   171600.0  \n • Purchase20231231004:   67900.0  \n • Purchase20231231005:   545000.0  \n • Purchase20231231006:   1380000.0  \n • Purchase20231231007:   206000.0  \n • Purchase20231231008:   244500.0  \n • Purchase20231231009:   16650.0  \n • Purchase20231231010:   1380000.0  \n • Purchase20231231011:   35850.0  \n • Purchase20231231012:   427500.0  \n • Purchase20231231013:   454000.0  \n • Purchase20231231014:   208560.0  \n • Purchase20231231015:   121440.0  \n • Purchase20231231016:   154500.0  \n • Purchase20231231017:   428000.0  \n • Purchase20231231018:   30300.0  \n • Purchase20231231019:   400320.0  \n • Purchase20231231020:   616320.0  \n • Purchase20231231021:   334080.0  \n • Purchase20231231022:   852480.0  \n\nWhen you add all these up the total purchase cost is\n\n  8202050.0\n\nStep 2. – Sum up all “Sale” transactions’ cost amounts (the “cost_amount” column on each sale row – in most “sale” rows the cost_amount is the “cost of goods sold” associated with that sale). (Each sale “uses up” some inventory.) When you add these (see our detailed grouping below) you get\n\n  356580.0\n\nStep 3. – Then the ending inventory value is simply\n\n  Ending Inventory = (Total Purchases) – (Cost Goods Sold)\n    = 8202050.0 – 356580.0\n    = 7845470.0\n\nSince no physical “inventory on hand” was set at the start (or it is assumed to be zero), the opening inventory value is 0.00.\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Inventory End Value\": \"7845470.00\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote: (The “step‐by‐step” – we essentially “accumulated” all the inventory item purchase amounts (8,202,050.00 in total) and subtracted from that the aggregate cost of sold items (356,580.00) to arrive at an ending book “inventory” of 7,845,470.00.)",
