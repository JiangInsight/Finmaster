                        "content": "We need to determine how much “cost” was “used‐up” on all sales. In other words, the “cost of goods sold” equals the sum (over all sale transactions) of the cost_amount value (which represents the cost of the product sold) on each sale line.\n\nLet’s illustrate briefly our method (we then add up all the sale transactions that “sold” products):\n\nBelow is a (shortened) list of sale rows (each row “Sale…” has a “cost_amount” column) – for example:\n\n• Sale20240102002 – cost_amount = 880.0  \n• Sale20240102003 – cost_amount = 1760.0  \n• Sale20240102004 – cost_amount = 4400.0  \n• Sale20240103007 – cost_amount = 10000.0  \n• Sale20240103008 – cost_amount = 3520.0  \n• Sale20240103009 – cost_amount = 4400.0  \n• Sale20240103010 – cost_amount = 5000.0  \n• …and many more\n\nWhen you go through every “Sale…” row in the table and add the “cost_amount” field for each, you end up with a total of 350,310.00.\n\nThat is, summing (in order) the cost_amount values of all sale transactions gives us 350310.00. (Note that purchases add inventory, while the cost “used” when a sale is made is taken from the inventory and recorded as “cost of goods sold.”)\n\nThus the final “Cost of Goods Sold” that should appear on the income statement is 350,310.00.\n\nThe answer in our required JSON format is as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"350310.00\"} }\n```",
