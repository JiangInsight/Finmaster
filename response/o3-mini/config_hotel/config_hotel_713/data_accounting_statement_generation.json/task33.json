(In our “Sales” rows each sale already shows its “tax_amount” – for example, the first sale row has 69.87; the next one 120.40; then 346.14; etc.) By adding all of those numbers for every sale line we obtained a total of about 26,593.89. (A detailed step–by–step summing was done in groups of 10 or so and then the group totals were added; the final sum rounded to two decimals is 26593.89.) \n\nThus the final “Tax Expense” item to report in the income statement is 26,593.89.\n\nThe answer in the requested JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Tax Expense\": \"26593.89\"\n  }\n}",
