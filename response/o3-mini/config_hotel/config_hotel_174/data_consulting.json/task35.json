                        "content": "We will calculate each metric step‐by‐step using the “End_amount” data from the three statements.\n\n1. Current Ratio  \n   Current Assets = 9,122,854.19  \n   Current Liabilities = 3,389,719.66  \n   Current Ratio = 9,122,854.19 / 3,389,719.66 ≈ 2.69\n\n2. Gross Profit Margin  \n   Gross Profit = 287,062.51  \n   Total Revenue = 791,992.51  \n   Gross Profit Margin = (287,062.51 / 791,992.51) × 100 ≈ 36.24%\n\n3. Debt to Asset Ratio  \n   In the balance sheet, Total Liabilities can be derived as Total Assets – Total Owner’s Equity:  \n     Total Assets = 19,501,451.49  \n     Total Owner’s Equity = 16,111,731.83  \n     Total Liabilities = 19,501,451.49 – 16,111,731.83 = 3,389,719.66  \n   Debt to Asset Ratio = 3,389,719.66 / 19,501,451.49 ≈ 0.1738 or 17.38%\n\n4. Net Profit Margin  \n   Net Profit = 111,731.83  \n   Total Revenue = 791,992.51  \n   Net Profit Margin = (111,731.83 / 791,992.51) × 100 ≈ 14.11%\n\n5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio  \n   Cash and Cash Equivalents (end balance) are the sum of Cash on Hand and Bank Deposits:  \n     Cash on Hand = 927,447.32  \n     Bank Deposits = 71,662.08  \n     Sum = 999,109.40  \n   Cash to Current Debt Ratio = 999,109.40 / 3,389,719.66 ≈ 0.2947 or 29.47%\n\n6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)  \n   FCF is typically defined as Cash Flow from Operating Activities minus Capital Expenditures.  \n     Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –4,504,752.68  \n     Purchase of Fixed Assets (CapEx) = 2,496,137.92  \n   FCF = –4,504,752.68 – 2,496,137.92 ≈ –7,000,890.60\n\n7. Return on Assets (ROA)  \n   ROA = Net Profit / Total Assets  \n   = 111,731.83 / 19,501,451.49 ≈ 0.00573, or 0.57%\n\nBelow is the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"2.69\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"36.24%\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"17.38%\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"14.11%\",\n    \"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"29.47%\",\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-7000890.60\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"0.57%\"\n  }\n}",
