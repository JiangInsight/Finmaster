                        "content": "We begin by calculating the ratios one‐by‐one using the values provided in the problem.\n\n1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n • Definition: Main Business Revenue (or Total Revenue) / Average Accounts Receivable  \n • Accounts Receivable at beginning = 0.00 and at end = 248540.09  \n • Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 248540.09) / 2 = 124270.045  \n • Revenue = 791992.51  \n • Ratio = 791992.51 / 124270.045 ≈ 6.38  \n\n2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n • Both ratios here are calculated as: Operating Cash Flow / Total Current Liabilities  \n • Operating Cash Flow (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) = –4504752.68  \n • Total Current Liabilities = 3389719.66  \n • Ratio = –4504752.68 / 3389719.66 ≈ –1.33  \n  (Thus, both ratios are –1.33)\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n • Definition: Revenue / Average Total Assets  \n • Total Assets at beginning = 16000000.00, at end = 19501451.49  \n • Average Total Assets = (16000000.00 + 19501451.49) / 2 = 17750725.745  \n • Revenue = 791992.51  \n • Ratio = 791992.51 / 17750725.745 ≈ 0.0446  \n  Rounded to two decimal places, this is approximately 0.04\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n • Definition: Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity  \n • From the balance sheet, Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity = 19501451.49 and Total Owner’s Equity = 16111731.83  \n • Therefore, Total Liabilities = 19501451.49 – 16111731.83 = 3389720 (approximately equal to the Total Current Liabilities field)  \n • Ratio = 3389719.66 / 16111731.83 ≈ 0.2105  \n  Rounded, we get approximately 0.21\n\nThus, the computed ratios are as follows.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"6.38\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-1.33\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.33\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.04\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.21\"\n  }\n}",
