                        "content": "We first gather the key figures from the provided statements:\n\n• From the Cash Flow statement:\n – Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –4,504,752.68 \n – Purchase of Fixed Assets = 2,496,137.92  \n    \n• From the Income Statement:\n – Net Profit = 111,731.83  \n – Main Business Revenue (Total Revenue) = 791,992.51  \n – Cost of Goods Sold = 504,930.00  \n – Gross Profit = 287,062.51  \n    \n• From the Balance Sheet:\n – Total Assets at beginning = 16,000,000.00  \n – Total Assets at end = 19,501,451.49  \n – Owner’s Equity at beginning = 16,000,000.00  \n – Owner’s Equity at end = 16,111,731.83  \n\nNow we compute the required ratios step by step.\n\n1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)  \n FCF is defined as Cash Flow from Operating Activities less Capital Expenditures (the purchase of fixed assets).  \n  FCF = (–4,504,752.68) – (2,496,137.92)  \n    = –7,000,890.60  \n\n2. Return on Assets (ROA)  \n First, compute average total assets:  \n  Average Total Assets = (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2  \n    = (16,000,000.00 + 19,501,451.49) / 2  \n    ≈ 17,750,725.745  \n Then, ROA = (Net Profit / Average Total Assets) × 100  \n  = (111,731.83 / 17,750,725.745) × 100  \n  ≈ 0.63%\n\n3. Return on Equity (ROE)  \n Compute average owner’s equity:  \n  Average Owner’s Equity = (Beginning Owner's Equity + Ending Owner's Equity) / 2  \n    = (16,000,000.00 + 16,111,731.83) / 2  \n    ≈ 16,055,865.915  \n Then, ROE = (Net Profit / Average Owner’s Equity) × 100  \n  = (111,731.83 / 16,055,865.915) × 100  \n  ≈ 0.70%\n\n4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio  \n This ratio is calculated as:  \n  Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Net Profit  \n  = (–4,504,752.68 / 111,731.83)  \n  ≈ –40.32  \n A negative value shows that despite a positive reported net profit, the operating cash flow is largely negative.\n\n5. Net Profit Margin  \n = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100  \n = (111,731.83 / 791,992.51) × 100  \n ≈ 14.11%\n\n6. Gross Profit Margin  \n = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100  \n = (287,062.51 / 791,992.51) × 100  \n ≈ 36.26%\n\nBelow is the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-7000890.60\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"0.63%\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"0.70%\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-40.32\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"14.11%\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"36.26%\"\n  }\n}",
