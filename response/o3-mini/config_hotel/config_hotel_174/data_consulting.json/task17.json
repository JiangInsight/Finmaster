In the sample problem, the “Total Current Liabilities” (which serve as a proxy for debt in our ratio) from the balance sheet are used. The Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is then calculated as:\n\n  Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFor the provided problem data:\n\n1. Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –4,504,752.68  \n2. Total Current Liabilities = 3,389,719.66\n\nNow, compute the ratio:\n\n  Ratio = –4,504,752.68 / 3,389,719.66 ≈ –1.33\n\nThus, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately –1.33.\n\nThe final answer in the required format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.33'}}",
