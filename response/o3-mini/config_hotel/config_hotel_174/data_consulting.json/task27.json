                        "content": "We start by identifying the key numbers from each statement.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n • From the cash flow statement, the “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities” is –4,504,752.68.\n\n • From the income statement, the “Net Profit” is 111,731.83.\n\n • The ratio is calculated as:\n  Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Net Profit)\n    = –4,504,752.68 / 111,731.83 ≈ –40.32\n  Note: In the provided example both values were negative so the negatives canceled. Here, the negative operating cash flow versus positive net profit gives a negative ratio.\n\n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\n • In the sample solution this “Turnover Ratio” was computed as Total Revenue divided by Ending Current Assets.\n • For our data:\n  Total Revenue = 791,992.51 (from the income statement)\n  Ending Total Current Assets = 9,122,854.19 (from the balance sheet)\n • Thus:\n  Ratio = 791,992.51 / 9,122,854.19 ≈ 0.0869, which rounds to 0.09\n\n3. Quick Ratio\n\n • The Quick Ratio considers only the most liquid current assets (cash, bank deposits, interest receivable and accounts receivable) divided by current liabilities.\n • From the balance sheet:\n  Cash on Hand = 927,447.32\n  Bank Deposits = 71,662.08\n  Interest Receivable = 5,264.70\n  Accounts Receivable = 248,540.09\n  Sum of “quick” assets = 927,447.32 + 71,662.08 = 999,109.40; then add Interest Receivable: 999,109.40 + 5,264.70 = 1,004,374.10; then add Accounts Receivable: 1,004,374.10 + 248,540.09 = 1,252,914.19\n • Current Liabilities are the sum of:\n  Accounts Payable = 3,350,120.00\n  Taxes Payable = 39,599.66\n  Total = 3,389,719.66\n • Thus:\n  Quick Ratio = 1,252,914.19 / 3,389,719.66 ≈ 0.3698 which rounds to 0.37\n\nWe therefore have:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-40.32\", \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.09\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.37\"}}",
