                        "content": "We first note that the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio measures how many times, on average, a company collects its receivables during a period. The most common formula is:\n\n  Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = (Net Sales or Main Business Revenue) / (Average Accounts Receivable)\n\nIn this problem:\n• From the income statement, Main Business Revenue = 791992.51.\n• From the balance sheet, Accounts Receivable at the beginning is 0.00 and at the end is 248540.09. Thus the Average Accounts Receivable = (0.00 + 248540.09) / 2 = 124270.045.\n\nNow, we calculate:\n  Ratio = 791992.51 / 124270.045 ≈ 6.38\n\nThus, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is approximately 6.38.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"6.38\"\n  }\n}",
