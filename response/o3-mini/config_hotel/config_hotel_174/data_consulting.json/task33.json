                        "content": "Let's go step‐by‐step to extract the figures and then compute the ratios.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n • From the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is –4,504,752.68.  \n • From the balance sheet, the “Total Current Liabilities” is 3,389,719.66.  \n • Thus, Operating Cash Flow Ratio = –4,504,752.68 ÷ 3,389,719.66 ≈ –1.33.\n\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \n • In this task (and as in the example) we use the operating cash flow divided by current liabilities.  \n • That gives –4,504,752.68 ÷ 3,389,719.66 ≈ –1.33.\n\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio  \n • We use the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and the average inventory.  \n • COGS (from the income statement) = 504,930.00.  \n • Inventory (from the balance sheet):  \n  – Beginning Inventory = 0.00  \n  – Ending Inventory = 7,869,940.00  \n • Average Inventory = (0.00 + 7,869,940.00) ÷ 2 = 3,934,970.00  \n • Inventory Turnover Ratio = 504,930.00 ÷ 3,934,970.00 ≈ 0.13.\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n • Total Liabilities can be determined by Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity:  \n  – Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity = 19,501,451.49  \n  – Total Owner's Equity = 16,111,731.83  \n  – Hence, Total Liabilities = 19,501,451.49 – 16,111,731.83 = 3,389,719.66  \n • Debt to Equity Ratio = 3,389,719.66 ÷ 16,111,731.83 ≈ 0.21.\n\n5. Quick Ratio  \n • Quick Assets = Current Assets – Inventory. From the balance sheet:  \n  – Total Current Assets = 9,122,854.19  \n  – Inventory = 7,869,940.00  \n  – Thus, Quick Assets = 9,122,854.19 – 7,869,940.00 = 1,252,914.19  \n • Quick Ratio = 1,252,914.19 ÷ 3,389,719.66 ≈ 0.37.\n\n6. Current Ratio  \n • Current Ratio = Total Current Assets ÷ Total Current Liabilities = 9,122,854.19 ÷ 3,389,719.66 ≈ 2.69.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.33\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-1.33\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"0.13\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.21\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.37\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"2.69\"\n  }\n}",
