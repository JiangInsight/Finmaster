                        "content": "We first extract the needed end‐of‐period values from the three statements. For the balance sheet we have:\n\n• Current Liabilities = 3,389,719.66  \n• Owner’s Equity (end) = 16,111,731.83  \n• Total Assets (end) = 19,501,451.49  \n• Current Assets = 9,122,854.19  \n – Inventory = 7,869,940.00  \n – (The “quick” part of current assets is the rest.)  \n• Accounts Receivable = 248,540.09  \n• Cash on Hand = 927,447.32  \n• Bank Deposits = 71,662.08  \n• Interest Receivable = 5,264.70  \n\nFor the income statement:  \n• Main Business Revenue = 791,992.51  \n• Net Profit = 111,731.83  \n\nFor the cash flow statement:  \n• Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –4,504,752.68  \n\nAlso, we note that the beginning balances (at 2023‑12‑31) for some items are given as follows:  \n• Total Assets = 16,000,000.00  \n• Owner’s Equity = 16,000,000.00  \n• Accounts Receivable = 0 (so average AR = ending / 2)\n\nWe now calculate each ratio step‐by‐step.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n   = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n   = (–4,504,752.68) / 3,389,719.66  \n   ≈ –1.33\n\n2. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n   The only liabilities shown equal Total Liabilities = Total Assets – Owner’s Equity  \n   = 19,501,451.49 – 16,111,731.83 = 3,389,719.66  \n   Hence,  \n   = Total Liabilities / Owner’s Equity  \n   = 3,389,719.66 / 16,111,731.83  \n   ≈ 0.21\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n   To use an average total asset base we use:  \n   Average Total Assets = (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2  \n   = (16,000,000.00 + 19,501,451.49) / 2  \n   = 35,501,451.49 / 2  \n   ≈ 17,750,725.75  \n   Then,  \n   = Total Revenue / Average Total Assets  \n   = 791,992.51 / 17,750,725.75  \n   ≈ 0.0446, which we report as 0.04\n\n4. Quick Ratio  \n   Quick Assets include cash, bank deposits, accounts receivable, and (if considered liquid) interest receivable. Here,  \n   Quick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable  \n   = 927,447.32 + 71,662.08 + 248,540.09 + 5,264.70  \n   = 999,109.40 (cash & equivalents) + 248,540.09 + 5,264.70  \n   = 1,247,649.49 + 5,264.70  \n   = 1,253,914.19  \n   Then,  \n   Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities  \n   = 1,253,914.19 / 3,389,719.66  \n   ≈ 0.37\n\n5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n   (Sometimes defined the same as the operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio.)  \n   = –4,504,752.68 / 3,389,719.66  \n   ≈ –1.33\n\n6. Return on Equity (ROE)  \n   We use net profit divided by average owner’s equity.  \n   Average Owner’s Equity = (Beginning + Ending) / 2  \n   = (16,000,000.00 + 16,111,731.83) / 2  \n   = 32,111,731.83 / 2  \n   ≈ 16,055,865.92  \n   Then,  \n   ROE = Net Profit / Average Owner’s Equity  \n   = 111,731.83 / 16,055,865.92  \n   ≈ 0.00696, or about 0.70%\n\n7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n   = Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n   Note: The beginning accounts receivable was 0. So, average AR = (0 + 248,540.09) / 2 = 124,270.045  \n   Then,  \n   = 791,992.51 / 124,270.045  \n   ≈ 6.38\n\nNow we present our answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.33\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.21\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.04\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.37\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.33\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"0.70%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"6.38\"\n  }\n}",
