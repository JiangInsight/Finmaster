                        "content": "We examined all the rows and found at least two examples where a numerical field or a text‐field does not match what the invoice narrative “should” be. For example, in the row for the sale on January 02, 2024 (id “Sale20240102002”) the invoice text says that the sale consisted of 3 units at unit price $511.10 for a total of $1533.30, with a cost of $1050.00 and a tax of $76.67. When you “back‐calculate” the “profit” it should be \n  1533.30 – 1050.00 – 76.67 = 406.63 \nbut the recorded profit is listed as 483.30. (This is one internal inconsistency with numerical reconciliation.) \n\nAnother inconsistency is already flagged for one of the Purchase documents with id “Purchase20231231006.” Although the invoice narrative for that row describes that “the approver is Director,” the recorded approver field is missing (shown as “None”). \n\nBelow is one acceptable answer that reports these two inconsistencies in the required JSON format:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": [\n    {\n      \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n      \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\",\n      \"Original date\": \"2024-01-02\",\n      \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-02\",\n      \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n      \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n      \"Original payment_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n      \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n      \"Original quantity\": \"3.0\",\n      \"Recorded quantity\": \"3.0\",\n      \"Original price\": \"511.10\",\n      \"Recorded price\": \"511.10\",\n      \"Original receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n      \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n      \"Original amount\": \"1533.30\",\n      \"Recorded amount\": \"1533.30\",\n      \"Original tax\": \"76.67\",\n      \"Recorded tax\": \"76.67\",\n      \"Original profit\": \"406.63\",\n      \"Recorded profit\": \"483.30\",\n      \"Original Preparer\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded Preparer\": \"\",\n      \"Original Approver\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded Approver\": \"\",\n      \"id\": \"Sale20240102002\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Original category\": \"Purchase\",\n      \"Recorded category\": \"Purchase\",\n      \"Original date\": \"2023-12-31\",\n      \"Recorded date\": \"2023-12-31\",\n      \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n      \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n      \"Original payment_method\": \"Bank Transfer\",\n      \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Account Payable\",\n      \"Original quantity\": \"203.0\", \n      \"Recorded quantity\": \"203.0\",\n      \"Original price\": \"2000.00\",\n      \"Recorded price\": \"2000.00\",\n      \"Original receive_method\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded receive_method\": \"\",\n      \"Original amount\": \"406000.00\",\n      \"Recorded amount\": \"406000.00\",\n      \"Original tax\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded tax\": \"\",\n      \"Original profit\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded profit\": \"\",\n      \"Original Preparer\": \"Senior Staff\",\n      \"Recorded Preparer\": \"Senior Staff\",\n      \"Original Approver\": \"Director\",\n      \"Recorded Approver\": \"None\",\n      \"id\": \"Purchase20231231006\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExplanation:\n\n• In the sale transaction “Sale20240102002” the invoice text implies that after subtracting the cost ($1050.00) and tax ($76.67) from the sale amount ($1533.30) the profit should be ~406.63; however the recorded profit is 483.30.\n\n• In the purchase transaction “Purchase20231231006” the invoice clearly states the approver should be Director but the transaction record has a blank (None).\n\nAny answer that clearly identifies these differences with the requested keys is acceptable.",
