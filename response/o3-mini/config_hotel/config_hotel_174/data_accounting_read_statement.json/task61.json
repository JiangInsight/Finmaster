Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers. In these financial statements, that cost is reported under the income statement line item \"Selling Expenses\" (as seen in the example and by typical classification). In our problem data the \"Selling Expenses\" is 9828.84.\n\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets. This is reported on the cash flow statement as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\". In our problem data the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is 2496137.92.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value1\": \"9828.84\",\n    \"value2\": \"2496137.92\"\n  }\n}",
