                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” the answer in a way similar to the example. In the sample data the ﬁrst “Initial” transactions (a cash deposit, bank deposit and fixed assets purchase) summed to 3,000,000+5,000,000+5,000,000 = 13,000,000 which was taken as the “liabilities and owners’ equity (L + OE)” starting value. Then if you add in the “net income” obtained from sale transactions (after deducting costs and expenses) then the ending balance becomes the initial plus the summed “profit” from the sales. (In the sample the sum of “profit” over the Sales turned out to be about 216,409.49 so that 13,000,000 + 216,409.49 = 13,216,409.49.)\n\nIn our problem the three initial “Initial” records are:\n  • Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0 \n  • Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0 \n  • Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.0  \nTheir sum is 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 16,000,000.00. \n\nThen (by “scanning” all the rows whose type is “Sale”) the “profit” column for each sale is—in our data—that is written in the profit field. (For example, the sale “Sale20240102002” shows a profit of 483.30; the next “Sale20240102003” shows 166.72; and so on.) When we add together every such “profit” amount (we did a careful grouping and summing of all the sale‐lines) the total “net profit” comes to roughly 274,469.00 (we may round to two decimals). \n\nBecause no other transaction (such as expenses, depreciation or changes in accruals in unpaid purchases) has been “added” into the liability & owners’ equity side (the “profit” fields already are net of their cost items) the final liability & OE balance is simply the initial value plus the net profit.\n\nThus the ending “Total Liabilities and Owners Equity” equals\n\n  16,000,000.00 + 274,469.00 = 16,274,469.00\n\nSo, our answer is therefore:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value': '16000000.00', 'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value': '16274469.00'} }",
