In our case the “Sale” rows include a “profit” (already representing the net of the sale – that is, its after–tax revenue less its cost) and then the expense‐side items (expenses, depreciation, etc.) are “subtracted” (and Interest receivables “added” on an accrual basis). One may “simulate” the process by going row‐by‐row as follows:\n\n1. Subtract the “Sales Expenses”, “Administrative Expenses”, “Financial Expenses” and “Depreciation” amounts.\n2. Add every “Sale” transaction’s “profit” (which is given per row).\n3. Add every “Interest Receivables” amount (even if “Unpaid”) with its sign.\n\nCarrying out that step–by–step aggregation over all the rows in the table produces a final net profit of about 150530.45.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"150530.45\"}}",
