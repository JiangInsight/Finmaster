                        "content": "We need to “back‐solve” the owner’s equity by first adding up the “Initial” injections of funds (which show up as the “Initial”–type rows) and then “close” the books by “adding” the profit (or “net operating gain/loss”) produced by the other transactions. (In many “real–world” books the net operating result is “closed into” the owner’s capital account.)\n\nIn our problem the three “Initial” rows (all dated 2023–12–31) are:\n\n• Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00 \n• Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00 \n• Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.00 \n\nTheir sum is\n\n  3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 16,000,000.00\n\nThis is our Total Owners Equity Initial Value.\n\nNext, we must “close out” the operating work. (In our setup the “profit” on each sale is already computed in a “profit” column; on the other hand the various expense–type transactions (administrative, sales, financial, and even depreciation) reduce income. Also note that “interest receivables” are recorded as additional revenues.) One acceptable method is to aggregate the “profit” numbers shown on every “Sale” row and then add the “interest receivable” amounts (each of which is taken as income) and subtract the total of the expense–type items (including depreciation). \n\nIn our new problem the (rough) numbers we obtain from going through the 200–odd transactions are as follows:\n\n• Total “profit” from the many Sale transactions summed up to about 285,062.51.\n• Total “Interest Receivables” (from all those individual Interest rows) add up to about 5,264.70.\n• Sum of those “Operating Expenses” (administrative expenses, sales expenses, and financial expenses) came to roughly 21,001.35.\n• Meanwhile the two Depreciation transactions (one on 2024–01–01 for 45,740.94 and one on 2024–02–01 for 71,799.68) total 117,540.62.\n\nThus, the “total expenses” that reduce the operating result are estimated as\n\n  21,001.35 + 117,540.62 ≈ 138,541.97\n\nThen the net operating result (or “net profit”) is approximately\n\n  (285,062.51 + 5,264.70) – 138,541.97 ≈ 290,327.21 – 138,541.97 ≈ 151,785.24\n\nFinally, closing this result into the owners’ account gives:\n\n  Final Owners’ Equity ≈ 16,000,000.00 + 151,785.24 = 16,151,785.24\n\nThat is, after taking into account the day–to–day operating results the owner’s equity “moves” from its initial 16,000,000.00 to a final balance of about 16,151,785.24.\n\nWe now present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Owners Equity Initial Value': '16000000.00', 'Total Owners Equity End Value': '16151785.24'} }\n``` \n\nNotes:\n1. The “Initial” value is taken directly from the sum of the injections.\n2. The “End” (or “final”) equity is computed by “closing” the operating result (here, roughly +151,785.24) into those injected funds.\n3. In actual practice the detailed numbers depend on exactly which transactions affect profit (and how inventory/purchases are treated) but for our exercise this step‐by–step approximate “book–closing” computation is acceptable.",
