                        "content": "We must “recover” from the transactions the net balance of all credit‐sales and “interest receivable” that have not been collected. In our books only those 【Sale】 entries whose “receive_method” is “Account Receviable” (instead of “Cash”) add to the ending accounts receivable balance, and the “Interest Receivables” lines (all of which are “Unpaid”) are also “on‐credit”. (In a cash‐flow statement, an increase in accounts receivable is shown as a use of cash, so the “change” is entered as a negative number.)\n\nBelow is one way to work through the solution step‐by‐step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Filter the Sale transactions that have receive_method = “Account Receviable”. In our data the following Sale lines contribute (amounts shown are the “after_tax_amount” values):\n\n • Sale20240102002: 1,456.63 \n • Sale20240103005: 2,867.95 \n • Sale20240104008: 649.54 \n • Sale20240106017: 10,388.36 \n • Sale20240106018: 4,902.87 \n • Sale20240107023: 1,822.10 \n • Sale20240107024: 3,326.63 \n • Sale20240108025: 10,173.50 \n • Sale20240110030: 1,072.74 \n • Sale20240111034: 30,963.92 \n • Sale20240112036: 25,062.33 \n • Sale20240112038: 9,561.56 \n • Sale20240113040: 2,506.76 \n • Sale20240114041: 6,427.51 \n • Sale20240114043: 3,397.23 \n • Sale20240115046: 20,261.19 \n • Sale20240117051: 16,556.07 \n • Sale20240117053: 8,155.73 \n • Sale20240118054: 2,401.96 \n • Sale20240118055: 19,315.06 \n • Sale20240119057: 3,820.25 \n • Sale20240120060: 2,131.88 \n • Sale20240120061: 3,007.06 \n • Sale20240123067: 2,328.03 \n • Sale20240125075: 7,982.28 \n • Sale20240126077: 13,024.07 \n • Sale20240127080: 5,958.51 \n • Sale20240129086: 2,692.49 \n • Sale20240131091: 13,898.83 \n\nSumming these gives a total credit‐sale balance of about 236,113.04.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Also add the “Interest Receivables” records. (Each “Interest” line is posted as “Interest Receivables” with the “receive_method” indicated as “Interest receviable”.) Adding all those (there are several “big‐sized” items – for example three lines of about 445, two of about 313.28, two of about 245.36, six of about 215.18, then eleven of about 132.50, and then ten small entries of about 6.38) one finds that all the interest receivable entries sum approximately to 5,264.70.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Then the ending Accounts Receivable balance is\n  236,113.04 (from credit sales)\n +   5,264.70 (from interest receivables)\n ——————————————\n  ≈ 241,377.74\n\nBecause the beginning period had no accounts receivable (or if the change is measured over the period, an increase in receivables uses cash) the operating cash‐flow line “(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable” is entered as a negative number of about –241,377.74.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-241377.74\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis is one acceptable answer based on summing the “after_tax_amount” of credit sales (with “Account Receviable” receive_method) plus the unpaid interest receivable entries.",
