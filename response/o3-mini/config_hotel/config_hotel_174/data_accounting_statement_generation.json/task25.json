In our records each sale transaction gives a “profit” value (that is already computed as its sales‐amount minus its cost of goods sold). Therefore the gross profit is the sum across all “Sale” lines’ profit values.\n\nI went “step‐by‐step” by scanning the table and adding the “profit” values from every row whose type is “Sale”. (Other items such as Purchases, Expenses, Depreciation, Interest, Initial and Fixed Assets are not part of the gross profit calculation.) For example, the “Sale20240102002” row reports a profit of 483.30; the “Sale20240102003” row has profit 166.72; the “Sale20240103004” row has profit 6144.34; and so on.\n\nAfter carefully adding all the profit amounts from every Sale transaction, one obtains a total of approximately 287062.51.\n\nThus the final gross profit item is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Gross Profit\": \"287062.51\"\n  }\n}\n\nBelow is the answer in the indicated JSON format.",
