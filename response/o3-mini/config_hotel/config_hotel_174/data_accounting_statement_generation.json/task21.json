                        "content": "We need to “pick out” from the huge list only those transactions that are of type “Sale” because the revenue from main business operations is obtained from actual sales. (Other transactions, such as Purchases, Expenses, Depreciation, etc., do not add to sales revenue.) Then we add‐up the “after_tax_amount” field in each sale row.\n\nLet’s show one example of the method (the data include many sale rows; each row shows an “after_tax_amount” value that is the money received for that sale).\n\nFor example, in one sale row the “id” is Sale20240102002 and its “after_tax_amount” is 1,456.63; the next one is Sale20240102003 and its “after_tax_amount” is 490.88; and so on. (There are over 80 such sale rows in the data.)\n\nStep‐by‐step we would:\n1. Filter out every transaction whose type field equals “Sale”.\n2. For each such row, extract its “after_tax_amount”.\n3. Sum all those numbers.\n\nBy carefully going through the list (see the “Sale…” rows below) and adding up all “after_tax_amount” values we get the following segment sums (we split the 87 sale rows into groups for ease of calculation):\n\n• Group 1 (rows 1–10): 14 56.63 + 490.88 + 15 337.12 + 2,867.95 + 13,652.64 + 649.54 + 35,919.78 + 1,032.93 + 881.50 + 14,671.65 = 86,960.62  \n• Group 2 (rows 11–20): 3,371.22 + 10,388.36 + 4,902.87 + 7,721.19 + 939.02 + 1,201.59 + 1,822.10 + 3,326.63 + 10,173.50 + 2,493.98 = 46,340.46  \n• Group 3 (rows 21–30): 33,280.64 + 4,669.15 + 1,072.74 + 1,763.72 + 4,054.07 + 30,963.92 + 429.46 + 25,062.33 + 6,712.02 + 9,561.56 = 117,569.61  \n• Group 4 (rows 31–40): 3,248.29 + 2,506.76 + 6,427.51 + 4,271.22 + 3,397.23 + 2,226.94 + 20,261.19 + 7,246.92 + 11,969.67 + 6,405.80 = 67,961.53  \n• Group 5 (rows 41–50): 16,556.07 + 1,099.25 + 8,155.73 + 2,401.96 + 19,315.06 + 1,215.59 + 3,820.25 + 10,097.44 + 11,962.88 + 2,131.88 = 76,756.11  \n• Group 6 (rows 51–60): 3,007.06 + 1,164.07 + 4,153.84 + 3,374.54 + 3,011.48 + 2,328.03 + 187.01 + 2,207.19 + 9,494.18 + 4,514.93 = 33,442.33  \n• Group 7 (rows 61–70): 4,980.51 + 40,057.65 + 7,982.28 + 24,640.70 + 13,024.07 + 33,775.62 + 742.11 + 5,958.51 + 13,436.46 + 4,503.40 = 149,101.31  \n• Group 8 (rows 71–80): 19,255.97 + 26,263.43 + 2,692.49 + 1,162.77 + 4,651.07 + 6,673.51 + 13,898.83 + 5,514.32 + 4,913.66 + 16,266.13 = 101,292.18  \n• Group 9 (rows 81–87): 14,641.59 + 5,249.51 + 2,095.05 + 5,674.07 + 1,097.04 + 15,968.93 + 28,242.51 = 72,968.70\n\nWhen we add all these group totals we get:\n 86,960.62 + 46,340.46 + 117,569.61 + 67,961.53 + 76,756.11 + 33,442.33 + 149,101.31 + 101,292.18 + 72,968.70 = 752,392.85\n\nThus the final “Main Business Revenue” (the sum of all sale “after_tax_amount”) is 752,392.85.\n\nWe now present the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Main Business Revenue\": \"752392.85\"} }\n```",
