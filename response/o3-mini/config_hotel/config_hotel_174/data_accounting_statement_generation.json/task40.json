                        "content": "We can “reconstruct” an inventory‐balance in the cash‐flow statement by “adding” up the cost side of all purchase transactions (which “add” inventory) and “subtracting” from that the cost recognized on sales (i.e. the “cost_amount” on sale transactions which “removes” inventory). In our case the only inventory‐related transactions are those of type “Purchase” (for which the purchase “amount” equals the purchase cost, computed as quantity × cost_per_unit) and the sales that report a “cost_amount.”\n\nStep 1. List and add the monetary amounts on all purchase rows:\n\n • Purchase20231231001: 680000.00 \n • Purchase20231231002: 80500.00 \n • Purchase20231231003: 342000.00 \n • Purchase20231231004: 43350.00 \n • Purchase20231231005: 1480000.00 \n • Purchase20231231006: 406000.00 \n • Purchase20231231007: 137280.00 \n • Purchase20231231008: 1310000.00 \n • Purchase20231231009: 763200.00 \n • Purchase20231231010: 315000.00 \n • Purchase20231231011: 36450.00 \n • Purchase20231231012: 288000.00 \n • Purchase20231231013: 103600.00 \n • Purchase20231231014: 339000.00 \n • Purchase20231231015: 132880.00 \n • Purchase20231231016: 665280.00 \n • Purchase20231231017: 230560.00 \n • Purchase20231231018: 316500.00 \n • Purchase20231231019: 57750.00 \n • Purchase20231231020: 299520.00 \n • Purchase20231231021: 348000.00\n\nWhen we add these amounts we obtain a total purchase cost of\n\n  8,374,870.00\n\nStep 2. List all “Sale” entries that record a “cost_amount” (the cost recognized when an item is sold). (For brevity we list below the cost_amount values from each sale record – note that the table had many sale transactions – and when you add them together you obtain:)\n\n  Total cost on Sales = 504,930.00\n\nStep 3. The “ending inventory” change is given by the difference between what was “added” (purchases) and what “left” (COGS). That is:\n\n  Ending inventory = Total Purchases – Total Cost of Goods Sold \n    = 8,374,870.00 – 504,930.00 \n    = 7,869,940.00\n\nIn the cash‐flow statement the “Inventory” line is reported as a change in working capital. An increase in inventory is a use of cash and is therefore “subtracted” (shown as a negative number). (Here the inventory “increased” by 7,869,940.)\n\nThus the final “(Increase) Decrease in Inventory” item is reported as –7,869,940.00.\n\nFinally, we present our answer in the requested json format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-7869940.00\"} }",
