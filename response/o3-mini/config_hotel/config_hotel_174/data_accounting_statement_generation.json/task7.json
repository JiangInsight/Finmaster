In this case the initial fixed asset balance is provided by the “Initial20231231001” record with asset type “Fixed Assets” with an amount of 8,000,000.00. (In our sample example the “Fixed Assets” record served as the beginning‐of‐period balance.) \n\nThen we scan the list for any additional fixed asset “purchase” entries. In our data there are two such transactions:\n1. A “Fixed Assets Purchase” record with an amount of 928,991.43 (asset “Central AC4”).\n2. Another “Fixed Assets Purchase” record with an amount of 1,567,146.49 (asset “Renovation Project5”).\n\nThe final fixed assets balance is computed by adding the purchases to the initial balance. (Note that in the sample solution the depreciation transaction was not deducted from the fixed asset total but was recorded separately.) \n\nSo we have:\n  Initial Fixed Assets = 8,000,000.00  \n  Additions = 928,991.43 + 1,567,146.49 = 2,496,137.92  \n  Final Fixed Assets = 8,000,000.00 + 2,496,137.92 = 10,496,137.92\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \n    \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"10496137.92\"\n  }\n}",
