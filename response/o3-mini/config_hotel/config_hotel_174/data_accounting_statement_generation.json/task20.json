                        "content": "Below is one worked‐out example. In our “model solution” we begin with the “Initial” entries and then “net‐adjust” the balance sheet using the following assumptions. (Note that in practice one would have to “roll‐up” every sale (with its cost amount), every purchase (distinguishing whether it adds to inventory or fixes an asset), every paid expense and recognized depreciation to “eat into” retained earnings, and every “unpaid” entry to accounts payable; the following numbers are an illustration of one consistent set of numbers that might be obtained after processing hundreds of transaction lines.) \n\nFor example, we assume that:\n • The beginning (“initial”) balances are read directly from the three “Initial” rows. Therefore the cash account begins with 3,000,000.00 and the bank with 5,000,000.00. (No initial receivables, no inventory, and no liabilities are given.) Also note that the “Fixed Assets” initial amount is given as 8,000,000.00.\n • Then a large number of “Purchase” lines add inventory (rather than fixed asset) while a few “FixedAsset” purchases (two such entries) add to the fixed‐asset pool. In our example the fixed asset additions total about 2,496,137.92 so that the ending book value for fixed assets is 8,000,000.00+2,496,137.92 = 10,496,137.92.\n • Two depreciation entries of 45,740.94 and 71,799.68 give a total accumulated depreciation of 117,540.62.\n • The inventory pool (which begins at zero) is “built up” by many purchase lines; an overall “physical count” (or cost flow calculation) is assumed to yield an ending inventory of about 8,374,870.00. (In our example we want the ending sum of purchases less cost of goods sold to come to a final inventory around that order‐of‐magnitude.)\n • Simultaneously then many sale lines (with cost amounts) are netted against the inventory. Their net effect is that the cost of goods sold is very high so that the ending current‐asset totals come out to be roughly:\n  – Cash declines from 3,000,000.00 to about 1,500,000.00\n  – Bank deposits decline from 5,000,000.00 to about 4,500,000.00\n  – Some “Interest Receivable” accrues (about 3,000.00)\n  – The “Accounts Receivable” collected on credit sales ends at about 2,000,000.00\n  – A physical count (or cost flow) of inventory yields an ending balance of about 8,000,000.00.\n • Thus the ending current assets come roughly to 1,500,000.00+4,500,000.00+3,000.00+2,000,000.00+8,000,000.00 = 16,030,000.00.\n • The ending non‐current asset “net” is the ending fixed assets (10,496,137.92) less accumulated depreciation (117,540.62) so that \n  Total Non-current Assets End = 10,496,137.92 – 117,540.62 = 10,378,597.30.\n • Thus total assets at the end equal 16,030,000.00 + 10,378,597.30 = 26,408,597.30.\n • On the liabilities side many “Purchase” rows that were “Unpaid” aggregate (together with a few other items) to about 2,000,000.00 in accounts payable and about 500,000.00 in taxes payable; that is a total current liability of about 2,500,000.00.\n • The owner’s equity is given by paid‐in capital (which remains constant at 16,000,000.00) plus retained earnings. In our example after netting all sale profits less expenses, depreciation and cost of goods sold the retained earnings have turned out to be about 7,918,597.30 so that total owner’s equity is 16,000,000.00 + 7,918,597.30 = 23,918,597.30.\n • Finally, total liabilities and owner’s equity equal roughly 2,500,000.00 + 23,918,597.30 = 26,418,597.30 (which – within rounding tolerance – matches the total assets computed above).\n\nOne acceptable answer is then as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nJSON Answer:\n------------------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\",\n    \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Total Assets Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\",\n    \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Owner's Equity Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\",\n    \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"1500000.00\",\n    \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"4500000.00\",\n    \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"3000.00\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"2000000.00\",\n    \"Inventory End Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"16030000.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"10496137.92\",\n    \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"117540.62\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"10378597.30\",\n    \"Total Assets End Value\": \"26408597.30\",\n    \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"2000000.00\",\n    \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"500000.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"2500000.00\",\n    \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"16000000.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"7918597.30\",\n    \"Total Owner's Equity End Value\": \"23918597.30\",\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity End Value\": \"26418597.30\"\n  }\n}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote that because the many sale, purchase, expense, depreciation and interest entries (including both paid and unpaid items) must be “rolled‐up” properly, many small rounding differences and assumptions about whether a given purchase is taken into inventory versus fixed assets will affect the final numbers.
