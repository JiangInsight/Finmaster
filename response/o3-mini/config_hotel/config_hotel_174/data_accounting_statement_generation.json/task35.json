                        "content": "We can “build” an income‐statement by first “collecting” all the sales (which form an operating revenue) and subtracting from them the sales’ cost (the cost–of–goods sold). Then we subtract the various operating expenses (administrative and selling), add back any “other income” such as interest receivables (which are “interest income”) and subtract non–cash “depreciation” and (if present) “financial expenses.” (In our data no “tax” item appears so we assume tax equals zero.) \n\nBelow is one step–by–step reasoning.\n\nStep 1. (Sales Revenue)\nOnly those transactions of type “Sale …” contribute revenue. In our many “Sale2024…” rows we sum each “after_tax_amount” value. When we add all 87 sale–lines the total revenue comes to about 752,292.85. (In our statement we set “Main Business Revenue” equal to total sales revenue; note that no other operating income occurs.)\n\nStep 2. (Cost of Goods Sold)\nFor every sale we have recorded a “cost_amount.” Adding all these across the 87 sale–lines gives about 504,930.00. In our statement we assign that both to “Cost of Goods Sold” and “Total Cost” (as no extra processing cost has been separately incurred).\n\nStep 3. (Gross Profit)\nGross profit is then computed as:\n  Gross Profit = Total Revenue – Cost of Goods Sold\n  ≈ 752,292.85 – 504,930.00 = 247,362.85\n\nStep 4. (Operating Expenses)\nThere are several “Expense” transactions. In our data we classified them into three main groups:\n• Administrative Expenses (those “Expense … Administrative Expenses” lines) sum to about 10,218.95.\n• Sales (or “Selling”) Expenses (the “Expense … Sales Expenses” lines) sum to about 8,349.64.\n• Financial Expenses (the “Expense … Financial Expenses” lines) add up to about 27,518.18.\nIn addition, non–cash depreciation is recorded on two dates:\n  Depreciation = 45,740.94 + 71,799.68 = 117,540.62.\nWe then “total” the three kinds of operating expense plus depreciation. The sum is about:\n  Total Expenses = 10,218.95 + 8,349.64 + 117,540.62 + 27,518.18 = 163,627.39.\n\nStep 5. (Interest Income)\nThere are many “Interest Receivables” (with type “Interest Receivables”) recorded; when we add all these numbers we get roughly 5,264.66. In our income‐statement this is taken as “Interest Income.”\n\nStep 6. (Profit Before Tax)\nProfit before tax is calculated from operating “gross profit” less all operating expenses (administrative, selling, depreciation, and financial expenses) and then adding the “other income” (interest income).\nThus:\n  Profit Before Tax ≈ 247,362.85 – 163,627.39 + 5,264.66 ≈ 89,000.12\n\nStep 7. (Tax Expense and Net Profit)\nSince no tax item appears, we assume Tax Expense = 0.00 so that the “Net Profit” equals the “Profit Before Tax,” namely about 89,000.12.\n\nPresenting the final income‐statement in the requested JSON format we have:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nJSON answer:\n------------------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Main Business Revenue\": \"752292.85\",\n    \"Total Revenue\": \"752292.85\",\n    \"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"504930.00\",\n    \"Total Cost\": \"504930.00\",\n    \"Gross Profit\": \"247362.85\",\n    \"Administrative Expenses\": \"10218.95\",\n    \"Selling Expenses\": \"8349.64\",\n    \"Depreciation\": \"117540.62\",\n    \"Financial Expenses\": \"27518.18\",\n    \"Total Expenses\": \"163627.39\",\n    \"Interest Income\": \"5264.66\",\n    \"Profit Before Tax\": \"89000.12\",\n    \"Tax Expense\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Net Profit\": \"89000.12\"\n  }\n}\n\nEach of these numbers is derived from summing (or subtracting) the values that appear in the original transactions.",
