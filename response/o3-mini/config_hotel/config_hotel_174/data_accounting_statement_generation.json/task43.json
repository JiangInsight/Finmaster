In our step‐by‐step “operating‐only” calculation we first “pick” the cash–affecting transactions (that is, only those in which money moves immediately as “Paid” or “Received in Cash” – and we ignore the noncash items such as depreciation, interest receivable that are still “unpaid,” the “Initial” and “Fixed Asset” funding rows, plus large asset–purchases which appear later) and then add up:\n • all the cash inflows from sales that were “Paid” (or received by cash)\n • subtract all cash–payments made for purchases and expenses that were “Paid” in cash (including payments by bank transfer, which we treat as “cash” here).\nAfter going transaction by transaction over the 100+ lines (for example, the “Sale” on 2024‑01‑02 with Paid status gave 516.72, the later “Sale” on 2024‑01‑03 gave 16144.34, the “Purchase” on 2023‑12‑31 for 680000.0 was an outflow, etc.), we obtain:\n\n Total “operating” cash receipts ≈ 542452.42 \n Total “operating” cash payments ≈ 3728204.10\n\nThus the net operating cash flow – that is, the amount received from operations minus that paid out – is\n\n Net operating CF = 542452.42 – 3728204.10 ≈ –3185751.68\n\n(We round to two decimals.) \n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-3185751.68\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote:\nBecause our dataset contains many rows and a wide variety of payment statuses and types, we have taken care only to include the “operating‐type” cash flows (cash received from customers, cash paying for operating purchases and expenses) and ignore noncash and financing/investing activities such as depreciation, fixed asset acquisitions and transfers.\n\nBelow is the final answer in the requested JSON format. \n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer:\n────────────────────────────\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-3185751.68\"\n  }\n}",
