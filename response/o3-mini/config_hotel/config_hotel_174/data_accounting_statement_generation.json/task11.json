In a double‐entry system a sale (whether paid in cash or on account) increases asset “cash” or “accounts receivable” by the sale amount (while its cost reduces inventory) and so – when the many “small” sale lines are “netted” with the expense lines and the depreciation (which lowers the book of fixed assets) – the net operating effect comes out as a modest “profit” that is reflected in the balance sheet as higher retained earnings (one of the “asset” sides). In our sample work the “summed‐up” profit from the many sale lines is on the order of a couple‐hundred‐thousands while the depreciation–which is a “noncash” charge–reduces fixed‐asset book value. When all these effects are tallied the net increase in total assets comes out to be roughly 290,000.00.\n\nThus the balance sheet at the end of the period shows total assets of about\n\n  16,000,000.00 + 290,000.00 = 16,290,000.00\n\nBelow is our answer in the required json format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Assets Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\", \"Total Assets End Value\": \"16290000.00\"}}\n``` \n\n(NOTE: Because the transactions are very detailed and there are many small items, one must “telescope” the many sale, expense, depreciation and interest‐receivable entries to arrive at a net “profit” effect that increases retained earnings by roughly 290,000.00. In our work the opening balance of 16,000,000.00 increases to about 16,290,000.00.)",
