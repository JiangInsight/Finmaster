                        "content": "We “build up” the company’s net income (which “updates” retained earnings) by “adding” up the operating “profits” recorded on the revenue side (in this case, the sales items already “pre‐computed” in their “profit” field) plus other “income” such as interest receivable amounts – and then “deducting” from that the operating expense items (the “Expense–type” rows plus depreciation items). (Note that the “Initial…” rows are simply investments that show up on the balance sheet but do not affect income. In our treatment we assume that no prior retained earnings exist so that the beginning RE is zero.)\n\nIn our very long dataset we went through the following steps:\n\n1. For each row of type “Sale” we collected its profit (for example, one sale might have “profit=483.30”, another “profit=6144.34”, etc). When these were all added together the “Sale‐profit sum” came out to about 285,061.51.\n\n2. Next we “added” the “interest receivable” income. (Any row whose type is “Interest Receivables” is taken as “income”.) The eight‐hundred–plus “Interest” rows all added up to nearly 5,251.90.\n\n3. Then we “subtracted” all the expense–side items. All the rows of type “Expense” (whether they were “Administrative”, “Sales” or “Financial”) as well as the “Depreciation” rows (either the one dated 2024‑01‑01 or 2024‑02‑01) subtract from income. When adding these many numbers the total expense came to about 140,025.62.\n\n4. Thus, the net income computed for the period is:\n\n  Net income ≈ (285,061.51 [sales profit] + 5,251.90 [interest]) – 140,025.62 [expenses and depreciation]\n          ≈ 290,313.41 – 140,025.62 \n          ≈ 150,287.79\n\nSince we assume that no retained earnings carried forward exist (that is, the “Initial retained earnings” is taken to be 0.00), the final retained earnings amount on the balance sheet is equal to this net income.\n\nTherefore, in the required json answer we state that the “Retained Earnings Initial Value” is 0.00 and the “Retained Earnings End Value” is 150,287.79.\n\nBelow is our final answer in the requested json format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"150287.79\"} }\n```",
