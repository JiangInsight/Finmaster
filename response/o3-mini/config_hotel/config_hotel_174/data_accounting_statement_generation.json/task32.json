                        "content": "We can “build” an income‐statement by “adding up” the profit (or “margin”) on the sales plus any interest revenue and then “deducting” the expense items (including all administrative/sales/financial expenses and depreciation). (Purchases, fixed‐asset acquisitions and transfers do not “hit” the income statement.) \n\nIn our example the calculation worked as follows:\n\n1. For each SALE row the “profit” was already recorded – essentially (sale amount minus cost‐amount). For example, one sale row had an amount 1533.3 and a cost‐amount 1050.0 so the profit shown was 483.30. When we summed every “Sale” row the total “sales profit” came to about 287062.51.\n\n2. Also the “Interest Receivables” rows (which are revenue) summed to about 5264.70.\n\n3. In contrast, every “Expense” row – whether “Sales Expenses”, “Administrative Expenses”, “Financial Expenses” or “Depreciation” – was taken as a negative cost. (Notice that the “Depreciation” row had a significant amount.) When all such expense amounts were added up the total “expense” was about 138019.60.\n\n4. Finally the profit before tax is found by adding the “sales profit” plus the “interest revenue” and then subtracting the expenses. In our running total that was\n\n  (287062.51 + 5264.70) – 138019.60 = 292327.21 – 138019.60 ≈ 154307.61\n\nThus our final computed profit before tax is about 154307.61.\n\nBelow is our answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Profit Before Tax\": \"154307.61\"} }\n``` \n\n(Note: The numbers were computed by “sweeping through” all the sale, interest and expense lines and then carrying out the simple add‐and‐subtract procedure.)\n",
