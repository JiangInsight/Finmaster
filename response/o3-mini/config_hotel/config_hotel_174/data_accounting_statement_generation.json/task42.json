                        "content": "We end up with a “tax‐payable” number equal to the net sales tax amount. In our data only sales transactions carry a nonblank “tax_amount” so (assuming that purchase invoices have no recoverable input‐tax) the tax liability that remains “to be paid” equals the sum of all the sale “tax_amount” values.\n\nLet’s explain briefly our reasoning:\n\n1. Looking at the table the only rows that show a tax value (“tax_amount”) are those with type “Sale …”. None of the non‑sale transactions (for example, Purchases, Expenses, Depreciation, Interest, Fixed Assets, etc.) list any tax amount. (In other “real‐world” work you might have input tax credits on purchases that are then deducted from VAT collected on sales but that information is not available here.)\n\n2. Therefore we interpret the “final tax payable” as the total output tax collected on sales.\n\n3. We then add up all the “tax_amount” figures on the sale rows. (We worked through all the sale rows one‐by‐one. The subtotal sum comes to 38,862.34.)\n\nThus the final answer is that the “Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable” is 38,862.34.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"38862.34\"\n  }\n}",
