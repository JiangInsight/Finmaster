(In contrast, initial “opening balance” entries are not “cash‐flow transactions” for the period and operating purchases of products that are held for resale normally fall under operating activities.)\n\nIn the table two rows are identifiable as investing transactions (they use a type like “Fixed Assets Purchase”):\n\n1. A row with id “FixedAsset20231231001” whose type is “Fixed Assets Purchase” on 2023‑12‑31 with an amount of 928991.43.\n2. A later row (with the same id but different asset description) of type “Fixed Assets Purchase” on 2023‑12‑31 with an amount of 1567146.49. (Its asset name is “Renovation Project5” and asset type “Renovation Project.”)\n\nNo other investing‐type cash flows appear (the “Initial” entries and the many “Purchase” rows involving, for example, “Luxury Suite” or “Business Meal Set” are operating in nature).\n\nBecause asset acquisitions are cash outflows, we sum the two fixed asset purchases and then take a minus sign:\n\n  928991.43 + 1567146.49 = 2496137.92\n\nThus, the net cash flow from investing activities equals –2496137.92.\n\nWe now present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-2496137.92\"}}\n```",
