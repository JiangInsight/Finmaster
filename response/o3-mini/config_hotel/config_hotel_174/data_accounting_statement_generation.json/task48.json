                        "content": "We end‐up finding that after “adding up” all the cash inflows – the beginning “deposit” entries plus every sale that really “paid in Cash” (or “Bank Transfer” as a cash equivalent) – and then subtracting every cash outflow (that is, every expense, cash–based purchase, non–credit‐purchase payment, cash–paid fixed assets and all “cash” transfers that leave the “cash” bucket) the overall “net increase in cash and cash equivalents” comes out to approximately –6,072,078.25. \n\nBelow is a sketch of our reasoning:\n\n1. In the “Initial” block the “Cash deposit” and “Bank deposit” lines add +3,000,000 and +5,000,000 while the “Fixed Assets” initial line (amount 8,000,000) is taken as a cash–using outflow.\n2. Then, for each subsequent transaction we “include” only those lines that are actually “Paid” (or “Paid by Bank Transfer”) while we ignore the “Unpaid” (receivable/account‐based) items and non–cash items (depreciation, interest receivables that have not been received, etc.). For example, several sales receipts using “Cash” add up to a total inflow of about 540,827.18 while many purchases and expenses (and even additional fixed asset purchases) reduce cash by an aggregate of about 14,612,905.43.\n3. Putting these together we get total cash inflows (including the initial cash deposits) of about 8,540,827.18 and total cash outflows of about 14,612,905.43.\n4. Subtracting outflows from inflows yields a net change of –6,072,078.25.\n\nThus the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"-6072078.25\"}\n} \n\nThis is our final answer.",
