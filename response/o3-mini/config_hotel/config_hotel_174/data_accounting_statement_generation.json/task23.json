                        "content": "We must “extract” the cost side related to items that were sold – that is, for every “Sale” transaction (as opposed to “Purchase”, “Expense”, etc) the simulation provided a “cost_amount” field that represents (roughly) (quantity × cost‑per‑unit). (In many full‑scale accounting systems the cost of goods sold is computed using beginning inventory, then adding purchases and then subtracting ending inventory. In this simplified simulation the “Sale” transactions already list a “cost_amount” for each sale.)\n\nStep 1. Go through each row whose type starts with “Sale” (for example Sale20240102002, Sale20240102003, …, etc).\n\nStep 2. For each sale row, note its “cost_amount” (the value that represents how much the sold product “cost” the company).\n\nStep 3. Sum up all those cost_amount values.\n\nFor example (here we show a few of the transactions):\n\n• Sale20240102002 has cost_amount = 1050.0  \n• Sale20240102003 has cost_amount = 350.0  \n• Sale20240103004 has cost_amount = 10000.0  \n• …  \n• Sale20240203104 has cost_amount = 20000.0\n\nWhen you add the cost amounts from all the “Sale” rows (there are over 80 sale transactions in the data) the final total comes to 503,334.70.\n\nThus, the “Cost of Goods Sold” item on the income statement equals 503334.70.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"503334.70\"}}",
