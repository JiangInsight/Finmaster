                        "content": "We need to “build the liabilities item” from the list of transactions. In our books each transaction that increases accounts–payable (a “liability” account) is one in which a purchase was made on “credit” (for which either the payment‐status is “Unpaid” and/or the payment method is “Account Payable”). (Note that the “Initial…” rows record assets, not liabilities.) \n\nLooking carefully through the  “problem” dataset, we identified the following purchase transactions that represent amounts still owed (that is, “Unpaid” and with the “payment_method” set to “Account Payable”). (Any purchase that was “Paid” is presumed to have been immediately financed by cash or bank funds and so does not appear as a liability.) \n\nBelow is a “step‐by‐step” outline of which rows were “credit purchases” and the amount posted to the liability:\n\n1. Row “Purchase20231231002”: amount = 80,500.00  \n2. Row “Purchase20231231003”: amount = 342,000.00  \n3. Row “Purchase20231231006”: amount = 406,000.00   \n4. Row “Purchase20231231012”: amount = 288,000.00  \n5. Row “Purchase20231231013”: amount = 103,600.00  \n6. Row “Purchase20231231015”: amount = 132,880.00  \n7. Row “Purchase20231231016”: amount = 665,280.00  \n8. Row “Purchase20231231017”: amount = 230,560.00  \n9. Row “Purchase20231231018”: amount = 316,500.00  \n10. Row “Purchase20231231020”: amount = 299,520.00  \n11. Row “Purchase20231231021”: amount = 348,000.00  \n\nNow let’s sum these amounts:\n\n• 80,500.00  \n+ 342,000.00 = 422,500.00  \n+ 406,000.00 = 828,500.00  \n+ 288,000.00 = 1,116,500.00  \n+ 103,600.00 = 1,220,100.00  \n+ 132,880.00 = 1,352,980.00  \n+ 665,280.00 = 2,018,260.00  \n+ 230,560.00 = 2,248,820.00  \n+ 316,500.00 = 2,565,320.00  \n+ 299,520.00 = 2,864,840.00  \n+ 348,000.00 = 3,212,840.00  \n\nIn our “opening” (initial) set of entries we see only “Initial…” lines that record cash, bank and fixed‐assets – so no liability is recorded at the very start. Hence the total initial liabilities (“Total Liabilities Initial Value”) equals 0.00.\n\nThus the end‐of–period liabilities (the “Total Liabilities End Value”) equals 3,212,840.00.\n\nBelow is the answer in the proper JSON format:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"3212840.00\"\n  }\n}\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is our final answer.",
