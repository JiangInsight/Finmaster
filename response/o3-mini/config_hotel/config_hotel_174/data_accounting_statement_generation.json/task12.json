                        "content": "We have to “net‐out” only the purchase and similar transactions that are recorded using the “Account Payable” payment method and that have a status of “Unpaid” – that is, the amounts that the business still owes to its suppliers. (The “Initial” entries simply set up cash, bank and fixed assets and do not create any payables.) \n\nLet’s explain briefly:\n\n• The “Initial” transactions (such as Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) do not impact accounts payable so the starting (initial) payable is zero.\n• Only “Purchase” records with an “Unpaid” “payment/receipt_status” and where the chosen “payment_method” is “Account Payable” are part of AP.\n• Scanning through the 200+ records (the full table below) we identify the following “Purchase” records that affect AP (with their “amount” values):\n\n 1. Purchase20231231002 – Amount = 80,500.00  \n 2. Purchase20231231003 – Amount = 342,000.00  \n 3. Purchase20231231006 – Amount = 406,000.00  \n 4. Purchase20231231007 – Amount = 137,280.00  \n 5. Purchase20231231012 – Amount = 288,000.00  \n 6. Purchase20231231013 – Amount = 103,600.00  \n 7. Purchase20231231015 – Amount = 132,880.00  \n 8. Purchase20231231016 – Amount = 665,280.00  \n 9. Purchase20231231017 – Amount = 230,560.00  \n 10. Purchase20231231018 – Amount = 316,500.00  \n 11. Purchase20231231020 – Amount = 299,520.00  \n 12. Purchase20231231021 – Amount = 348,000.00  \n\nNow, summing these numbers step‐by‐step:\n\n • 80,500.00 + 342,000.00 = 422,500.00  \n • 422,500.00 + 406,000.00 = 828,500.00  \n • 828,500.00 + 137,280.00 = 965,780.00  \n • 965,780.00 + 288,000.00 = 1,253,780.00  \n • 1,253,780.00 + 103,600.00 = 1,357,380.00  \n • 1,357,380.00 + 132,880.00 = 1,490,260.00  \n • 1,490,260.00 + 665,280.00 = 2,155,540.00  \n • 2,155,540.00 + 230,560.00 = 2,386,100.00  \n • 2,386,100.00 + 316,500.00 = 2,702,600.00  \n • 2,702,600.00 + 299,520.00 = 3,002,120.00  \n • 3,002,120.00 + 348,000.00 = 3,350,120.00  \n\nThus the total outstanding “Accounts Payable” amount at period–end comes to 3,350,120.00.\n\nSince no AP existed initially (the “Initial” transactions had no payable items), the final (end) value of Accounts Payable is 3,350,120.00.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"3350120.00\"\n  }\n}",
