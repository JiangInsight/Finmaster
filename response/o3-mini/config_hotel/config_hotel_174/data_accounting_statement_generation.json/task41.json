                        "content": "We must “build” the accounts‐payable balance as the net effect of purchase transactions that are not paid immediately but recorded “on account.” In our data the only entries that affect AP are those Purchase transactions that have a payment/receipt_status of “Unpaid” (and usually a payment_method “Account Payable”). In our case we scan the “Purchase” rows (by their id) and pick those with “Unpaid” status and/or with the “Account Payable” payment method. (Transactions recorded as “Paid” have been settled right away and therefore do not add to AP.)\n\nBelow is a list of the purchase transactions that result in AP along with their amounts:\n\n1. Purchase20231231002 – Amount = 80,500.0  \n2. Purchase20231231003 – Amount = 342,000.0  \n3. Purchase20231231006 – Amount = 406,000.0  \n4. Purchase20231231007 – Amount = 137,280.0  \n5. Purchase20231231012 – Amount = 288,000.0  \n6. Purchase20231231013 – Amount = 103,600.0  \n7. Purchase20231231015 – Amount = 132,880.0  \n8. Purchase20231231016 – Amount = 665,280.0  \n9. Purchase20231231017 – Amount = 230,560.0  \n10. Purchase20231231018 – Amount = 316,500.0  \n11. Purchase20231231020 – Amount = 299,520.0  \n12. Purchase20231231021 – Amount = 348,000.0  \n\nNow we add these amounts step‐by‐step:\n\n• 80,500 + 342,000 = 422,500  \n• 422,500 + 406,000 = 828,500  \n• 828,500 + 137,280 = 965,780  \n• 965,780 + 288,000 = 1,253,780  \n• 1,253,780 + 103,600 = 1,357,380  \n• 1,357,380 + 132,880 = 1,490,260  \n• 1,490,260 + 665,280 = 2,155,540  \n• 2,155,540 + 230,560 = 2,386,100  \n• 2,386,100 + 316,500 = 2,702,600  \n• 2,702,600 + 299,520 = 3,002,120  \n• 3,002,120 + 348,000 = 3,350,120  \n\nNo other transactions “reverse” these amounts (for example payments against AP are recorded at the time of purchase as “Paid” rather than leaving a credit balance). Therefore the net increase in accounts payable is 3,350,120.00.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"3350120.00\"\n  }\n}",
