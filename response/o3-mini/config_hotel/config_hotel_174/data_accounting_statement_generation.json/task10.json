                        "content": "We need to “build up” the non‐current assets starting from the “Initial” fixed assets record, then add any acquisitions (purchases that relate to “rooms”, “suites”, “AC” or “renovation” items) and finally subtract the depreciation.\n\nBelow is one step‐by‐step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the “fixed asset” initial balance. In our data the row\n\n  Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | … | amount = 8000000.0\n\nis the “initial” value of our property, plant and equipment. (That is our “initial non‑current assets” value.)\n\n2. Next, add the purchases that are for capital assets. In our data (only those whose product or asset identifiers suggest a “room”, “suite”, “AC” or “renovation” item are capitalized) we have:\n • Purchase20231231001 (“Luxury Suite” – product R003): amount = 680000.0\n • Purchase20231231003 (“Business Room” – product R002): amount = 342000.0\n • Purchase20231231008 (“Luxury Suite” – product R003): amount = 1310000.0\n • Purchase20231231010 (“Standard Room” – product R001): amount = 315000.0\n • Purchase20231231012 (“Business Room” – product R002): amount = 288000.0\n • Purchase20231231014 (“Standard Room” – product R001): amount = 339000.0\n • Purchase20231231018 (“Standard Room” – product R001): amount = 316500.0\n • Purchase20231231021 (“Business Room” – product R002): amount = 348000.0\n\nSumming these purchase additions:\n  680000.0 + 342000.0 = 1,022,000.0  \n  1,022,000.0 + 1,310,000.0 = 2,332,000.0  \n  2,332,000.0 + 315000.0 = 2,647,000.0  \n  2,647,000.0 + 288000.0 = 2,935,000.0  \n  2,935,000.0 + 339000.0 = 3,274,000.0  \n  3,274,000.0 + 316500.0 = 3,590,500.0  \n  3,590,500.0 + 348000.0 = 3,938,500.0\n\n3. Also, there are “Fixed Assets Purchase” lines (which are used when an entire asset – for example, equipment with a specific asset‐name – is acquired):\n • FixedAsset20231231001 (with asset \"Central AC4\") with amount = 928991.43  \n • FixedAsset20231231001 (with asset \"Renovation Project5\") with amount = 1567146.49\n\nTheir sum is: 928991.43 + 1567146.49 = 2496137.92\n\n4. Now, add these acquisitions (capital additions) to the initial “Fixed Assets” value:\n Initial = 8000000.0  \n Add “Purchase” assets = 3,938,500.0  \n Add “Fixed Asset” purchases = 2,496,137.92  \n Total “before depreciation” = 8000000.0 + 3,938,500.0 + 2,496,137.92 = 14,434,637.92\n\n5. Finally, subtract the depreciation charges. In our data there are two depreciation lines:\n • Depreciation20240101001: 45740.94  \n • Depreciation20240201002: 71799.68  \nTheir total is 45740.94 + 71799.68 = 117540.62\n\nThus, the ending value is:\n 14,434,637.92 – 117540.62 = 14,317,097.30\n\n6. The “Total Non-current Assets Initial Value” is the initial “Fixed Assets” value (8000000.00) and the “Total Non-current Assets End Value” is our computed value (14,317,097.30).\n\nThe answer (formatted to two decimals) is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"14317097.30\"\n  }\n}\n\nThus, we have solved the task step by step.",
