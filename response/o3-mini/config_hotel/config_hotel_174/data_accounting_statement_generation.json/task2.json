                        "content": "We must “build” the bank‐deposits “balance” from the transactions that are recorded for the bank account. In our books the opening (initial) bank deposit is given explicitly (in the “Initial…Bank deposit” row) and then – whenever the business “pays” using a bank transfer – money leaves that bank account. (Other transactions such as “paid by Cash” or “unpaid” or “sales on account” do not move the “bank‐deposit” itself.) In our problem the only transactions that move bank deposits are those in which the “Payment Method” is “Bank Transfer” (and fixed‐asset purchases or other outlays made using bank transfer).\n\nLet’s explain step‐by‐step:\n\n1. The very first “Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit” row shows an opening bank‐deposit balance of 5,000,000.00.\n\n2. Now we scan through the table (every row with a “Paid” status whose Payment Method is “Bank Transfer”). In our problem data the following rows are of that kind:\n • “Purchase20231231005” – a Purchase paid by Bank Transfer for 1,480,000.00.\n • “Purchase20231231009” – a Purchase (in our table, note the Payment Method is “Bank Transfer”) for 763,200.00.\n • “Purchase20231231014” – a Purchase paid by Bank Transfer for 339,000.00.\n • “FixedAsset20231231001” (the first one) – a Fixed Assets Purchase paid by Bank Transfer for 928,991.43.\n • “FixedAsset20231231001” (the later one – note its asset name is “Renovation Project5”) – a Fixed Assets Purchase paid by Bank Transfer for 1,567,146.49.\n\n All of these represent outflows from the bank (money “leaving” the bank deposit).\n\n3. We now sum these bank–transfer outflows:\n • Sum = 1,480,000.00 + 763,200.00 + 339,000.00 + 928,991.43 + 1,567,146.49.\n Let’s add step‐by‐step:\n  – 1,480,000.00 + 763,200.00 = 2,243,200.00\n  – 2,243,200.00 + 339,000.00 = 2,582,200.00\n  – 2,582,200.00 + 928,991.43 = 3,511,191.43\n  – 3,511,191.43 + 1,567,146.49 = 5,078,337.92\n\n4. Finally, we compute the “final” bank deposit balance.\n Starting with a bank deposit of 5,000,000.00, subtract the outflow of 5,078,337.92:\n  Final bank deposits = 5,000,000.00 – 5,078,337.92 = –78,337.92\n\n(The negative ending balance means that (if no other deposit‐in transactions occur) the bank account would be overdrawn by about 78,337.92.)\n\nThus we have:\n Initial Bank Deposits = 5,000,000.00 \n Final Bank Deposits = –78,337.92\n\nBelow is our answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"-78337.92\"} }\n```",
