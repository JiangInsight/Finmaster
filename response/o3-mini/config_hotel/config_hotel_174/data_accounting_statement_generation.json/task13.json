(The “Initial” rows do not carry any tax‐amount so they “set” an initial balance of zero.) In our “working” we went through every sale transaction and added its tax_amount. (For example, the sale with id “Sale20240102002” shows 76.67 as its tax, “Sale20240102003” has 25.84, “Sale20240103004” shows 807.22, etc.) When we add the tax_amount from each sale row (there are 85 such lines in our list) the overall result is a sum of 38,861.34.\n\nThus the taxes payable at the start of the period is 0.00 and at the period‐end (after processing all transactions) is 38,861.34.\n\nBelow is our answer in the required json format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"38861.34\"\n  }\n}\n\n(This answer is reached by “reading” the tax_amount column from every sale transaction and summing them across the period.)",
