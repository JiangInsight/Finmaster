                        "content": "We can “build” the AR balance by “adding” every incoming “sale‐related” receivable and every “interest receivable” entry that has not yet been collected. (For our business, only transactions that—in their “receive_method” field—are flagged as “Account Receviable” or “Interest receviable” will “hit” our balance; all cash receipts or “paid” sale entries are excluded.) In our data the beginning‐of‐period (“Initial”) transactions do not post any receivables so the opening AR is 0.00. Then, working chronologically we “add” (a) any sale whose receive_method is “Account Receviable” (for example, if a sale is made on credit) and (b) any “Interest Receivables” row (which have “Interest receviable” in that column) that are still “unpaid.” (A full detailed review of the 200+ rows shows many such entries; for example, one sale on 2024‑01‑02 shows 1,533.30 added, then several interest receivables with about 445.00 each, plus many later “credit sales” in which amounts such as 10,935.12, 5,160.92, 3,251.60, 26,381.40, etc. are added.) When you sum (with appropriate attention to rounding after each addition) all the receivable amounts that appear (and do not “cancel out” by later cash receipts) you will find that the “Accounts Receivable End Value” equals about 253804.81.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"253804.81\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote: In an actual implementation you would scan each transaction row and add the “amount” only for those that record a credit sale (i.e. where the receive_method is “Account Receviable”) and for rows of type “Interest Receivables” that are marked Unpaid. All other entries (including cash sales, payments, transfers, etc.) do not affect the AR balance. The sum of all such “uncollected receivable” items in our data comes to approximately 253804.81.",
