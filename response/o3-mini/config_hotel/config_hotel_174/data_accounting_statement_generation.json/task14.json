                        "content": "We must “extract” from the list only those transactions that create a current liability – that is, those transactions that represent a purchase (or similar obligation) that is not yet paid (i.e. their “payment/receipt_status” is “Unpaid”) and that appear on the “balance‐sheet side” as payable.\n\nNotice that none of the “Initial” transactions (such as cash deposit, bank deposit and fixed assets purchase) create a liability; they are showing capital increases. Also, most “Sale” transactions in our list are either “Paid” or – if “Unpaid” – they generate accounts receivable (an asset), not a liability.\n\nThus we need only to focus on “Purchase” transactions whose payment status is “Unpaid” (and that have “Account Payable” as the payment method). Scanning through the file we identify these “Purchase” transactions (with their amounts):\n\n1. Purchase20231231002 – Unpaid – amount = 80,500.00  \n2. Purchase20231231003 – Unpaid – amount = 342,000.00  \n3. Purchase20231231006 – Unpaid – amount = 406,000.00  \n4. Purchase20231231007 – Unpaid – amount = 137,280.00  \n5. Purchase20231231012 – Unpaid – amount = 288,000.00  \n6. Purchase20231231013 – Unpaid – amount = 103,600.00  \n7. Purchase20231231015 – Unpaid – amount = 132,880.00  \n8. Purchase20231231016 – Unpaid – amount = 665,280.00  \n9. Purchase20231231017 – Unpaid – amount = 230,560.00  \n10. Purchase20231231018 – Unpaid – amount = 316,500.00  \n11. Purchase20231231020 – Unpaid – amount = 299,520.00  \n12. Purchase20231231021 – Unpaid – amount = 348,000.00  \n\nNow we sum these amounts step‐by‐step:\n\n• 80,500.00  \n  + 342,000.00 = 422,500.00  \n  + 406,000.00 = 828,500.00  \n  + 137,280.00 = 965,780.00  \n  + 288,000.00 = 1,253,780.00  \n  + 103,600.00 = 1,357,380.00  \n  + 132,880.00 = 1,490,260.00  \n  + 665,280.00 = 2,155,540.00  \n  + 230,560.00 = 2,386,100.00  \n  + 316,500.00 = 2,702,600.00  \n  + 299,520.00 = 3,002,120.00  \n  + 348,000.00 = 3,350,120.00  \n\nThus the total current liabilities generated during the period equal 3,350,120.00.\n\nAlso note that at the beginning of the period (the “Initial” balance sheet date) no liability items were entered (the “Initial” entries show only assets such as deposits and fixed assets). So the “Total Current Liabilities Initial Value” is 0.00.\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"3350120.00\"\n  }\n}",
