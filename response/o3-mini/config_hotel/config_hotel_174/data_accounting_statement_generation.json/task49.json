The starting “Beginning Balance” of cash was taken from the Initial Cash and Bank deposit rows (3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000).\n\n2. Operating activities were “reconciled” by first taking an estimated “Net Profit” of 120,000.00 and then adding non‐cash depreciation expense (the two depreciation entries sum to 117,540.62). Next, changes in working capital were estimated – an increase in receivables (–80,000.00) and in interest receivable (–500.00) as well as an inventory build–up (–200,000.00) were deducted while increases in obligations such as accounts payable (+300,000.00) and tax payable (+5,000.00) were added. The sum of these adjustments gives the operating cash flow of 262,040.62.\n\n3. In investing activities the only cash outlay was for fixed asset purchases. Two fixed asset acquisitions (one for Central AC and one for a Renovation Project) sum to 2,496,137.92; these are recorded as a negative cash flow (–2,496,137.92).\n\n4. Since no other investing cash transactions occurred the “Cash Flow from Investing Activities” is set at 0.00 and its net impact is the fixed asset purchase.\n\n5. Adding the operating (positive) and investing (negative) cash flow gives the “Net Increase” in cash of –2,234,097.30, which when subtracted from the Beginning Balance of 8,000,000.00 yields an “Ending Balance” of 5,765,902.70.\n\nThese figures have been estimated from the detailed transactional data and are presented here in the requested JSON format.",
