                        "content": "We can “derive” the net profit by “adding‐up” the “profit” portions on the sale lines (which already reflect the difference between the sale’s after–tax proceeds and its cost of goods sold) and then “adjusting” (in our simplified case) by subtracting operating expense items (such as the direct “Expense” and “Depreciation” amounts) and “adding” the “Interest” amounts that represent income even if not yet collected. (In a full‐fledged accounting treatment many of the “Purchase” and “Fixed Asset” transactions are “investment” rather than operating entries and do not enter the “profit” number on the income statement.) \n\nIn our example the rough steps were:\n\n1. Sum up the sale “profit” figures from all 87 sale transactions. That total comes to about 287062.51.\n2. Sum up the “Expense” items (for both “Sales expenses” and “Administrative expenses”) as well as the “Depreciation” entry. In our table these add to about 3973.63 (from the “Expense” rows) plus 45740.94 (from the “Depreciation” row) for a total of 49714.57.\n3. Then – because the table also shows many “Interest Receivables” (which are income even when unpaid) – we add up those “Interest” amounts (all the rows with type “Interest Receivables”) to get about 5264.65.\n4. Finally we combine these subtotals as follows:\n\n  Net profit ≈ (sum of “Sale profit”) – (sum of operating “Expense” and “Depreciation”) + (sum of “Interest Receivables”)\n        ≈ 287062.51 – 49714.57 + 5264.65 \n        ≈ 242612.59\n\nThus, following this “step‐by‐step” approximate calculation we may report the final net profit as about 242612.59.\n\nBelow is our answer in the requested json format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"242612.59\"}}\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: In a real system each transaction’s effect on profit would be derived using full accounting principles; here we have “summed” the given sale “profit” fields and then adjusted for the expense/depreciation totals and interest income to arrive at an approximate net profit figure.",
