                        "content": "We must “build” the net fixed‐assets story from the transactions. In our setup the “Fixed Assets” account starts with an initial balance; then during the period any further “fixed asset purchases” are added to the balance (i.e. new assets purchased, recorded as “Fixed Assets Purchase” transactions) and afterward “depreciation” is deducted from the gross asset balance leaving a “net” figure.\n\nStep‑by‑step:\n\n1. The initial “Fixed Assets” entry is on the 2023‑12‑31 containing 8,000,000.00.\n\n2. Next we scan for additional fixed asset “purchases”. In the transaction list there are two rows where the “type” is “Fixed Assets Purchase”:\n • One records 928,991.43.\n • The other records 1,567,146.49.\n Adding these two gives:\n  928,991.43 + 1,567,146.49 = 2,496,137.92.\n\n3. So the gross fixed assets at period‑end (before depreciation) become:\n  Initial (8,000,000.00) + Additions (2,496,137.92) = 10,496,137.92.\n\n4. During the period there are depreciation transactions which reduce the asset’s carrying value. In our list we found two depreciation entries:\n • One for 45,740.94.\n • One for 71,799.68.\n Their total is:\n  45,740.94 + 71,799.68 = 117,540.62.\n\n5. Finally, subtracting total depreciation from the gross fixed asset balance gives the net fixed assets at period‑end:\n  10,496,137.92 – 117,540.62 = 10,378,597.30.\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n• Fixed assets net Initial Value: 8,000,000.00  \n• Fixed assets net End Value: 10,378,597.30\n\nBelow is the answer in the specified JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'fixed assets net Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'fixed assets net End Value': '10378597.30'}}",
