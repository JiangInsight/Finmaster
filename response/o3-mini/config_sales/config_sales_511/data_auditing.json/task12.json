(Many rows have numbers that exactly match the computed “quantity × unit_price” values and other fields and so appear internally consistent.) In our review one discrepancy was found. For the transaction with id “Expense20240110001” (one of the Sales Expenses rows on January 10, 2024) the invoice text states “...the approver is Director” while the “recorded_approver” field is missing (recorded as “None”). Our best‐estimate correction is therefore that the recorded approver should read “Director.”\n\nBelow is our answer in the required JSON format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sales Expenses\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-10\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-10\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Original payment_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original quantity\": \"Not applicable (no discrepancy)\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"Not applicable (no discrepancy)\", \"Original price\": \"Not applicable (no discrepancy)\", \"Recorded price\": \"Not applicable (no discrepancy)\", \"Original receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original amount\": \"$5999.52\", \"Recorded amount\": \"$5999.52\", \"Original tax\": \"Not provided\", \"Recorded tax\": \"Not provided\", \"Original profit\": \"Not provided\", \"Recorded profit\": \"Not provided\", \"Original Preparer\": \"Senior Staff\", \"Recorded Preparer\": \"Senior Staff\", \"Original Approver\": \"Director\", \"Recorded Approver\": \"None\", \"id\": \"Expense20240110001\"}}",
