For example, the row for transaction ID “Interest20240114014” is recorded with a status of “Paid” in its payment/receipt_status field; however, the invoice text clearly states “...this transaction was unpaid” (and the receive_method is “interest receviable”). This indicates that the recorded status is in error. Based on the invoice narrative we judge the correct payment/receipt_status for this transaction should be “Unpaid.”\n\nBelow is the JSON output following the required format:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': None, 'Recorded category': None, 'Original date': None, 'Recorded date': None, 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Original payment_method': None, 'Recorded payment_method': None, 'Original quantity': None, 'Recorded quantity': None, 'Original price': None, 'Recorded price': None, 'Original receive_method': None, 'Recorded receive_method': None, 'Original amount': None, 'Recorded amount': None, 'Original tax': None, 'Recorded tax': None, 'Original profit': None, 'Recorded profit': None, 'Original Preparer': None, 'Recorded Preparer': None, 'Original Approver': None, 'Recorded Approver': None, 'id': 'Interest20240114014'}}",
