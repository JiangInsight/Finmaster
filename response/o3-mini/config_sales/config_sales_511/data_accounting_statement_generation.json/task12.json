In our file the starting (“initial”) balances come only from the “Initial” entries (cash deposit, bank deposit, fixed assets) – none of which add anything to accounts payable – so the beginning accounts payable balance is 0.00.\n\nThen we scan the “Purchase” transactions (by their ids and table rows) and note those that are “Unpaid” (payment/receipt_status = Unpaid) and – importantly – that use “Account Payable” as the payment_method. In our list these are:\n\n1. Transaction with id Purchase20231231009 – amount = 60,000.0  \n2. Transaction with id Purchase20231231013 – amount = 250,000.0  \n3. Transaction with id Purchase20231231018 – amount = 60,000.0  \n\nAll other purchase transactions were “Paid”. Adding these three amounts gives:\n  60,000 + 250,000 + 60,000 = 370,000.0\n\nThus, at the end of the period the total amount still owed (i.e. “Accounts Payable End Value”) is 370,000.00.\n\nSo our answer is:\n\n{\n  \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"370000.00\"\n}",
