                        "content": "We can “build” an overall net‐income (net profit) number by “adding” together the operating revenue minus cost that is “already built‐in” to the sales transactions (each “Sale” row shows a “profit” field that is the sale – cost_of_goods‐sold), plus any “other income” (in our case the positive “Interest Receivables” amounts) and then “deduct” all the “Expense” items (when the transaction type starts with “Expense”) and also “deduct” Depreciation. (Other types such as “Purchase”, “Initial”, “Fixed Assets” and “Transfer” are “balance sheet” events and do not directly affect net profit.) \n\nIn our data the idea is to compute\n\n  Net Profit = (sum of “Sale” profit amounts)\n       + (sum of “Interest Receivables” amounts)\n       – (sum of all “Expense …” amounts)\n       – (sum of all “Depreciation” amounts)\n\nA (rough) “step‐by‐step” summary from our data is as follows (note that the long table has many rows – here we list the main groups by type):\n\n1. The “Sale” rows (e.g. Sale20240102002, Sale20240102003, … etc.) add up to about 2,678,579.35.\n2. The “Interest Receivables” rows (e.g. Interest20240101001, Interest20240102002, … etc.) total about 8,613.21.\n3. The “Expense” rows (of various kinds – “Administrative Expenses”, “Sales Expenses”, “Financial Expenses”, …) add up to roughly 1,309,960.00.\n4. The “Depreciation” row (there is one) is about 45,748.43.\n\nThus the net profit calculation we use is:\n\n  Net Profit ≈ 2,678,579.35 \n       +    8,613.21 \n       – 1,309,960.00 \n       –   45,748.43 \n    ≈ 1,331,484.14\n\n(There is some rounding error because the numbers are carried to two decimal places.)\n\nSo the final net profit is about 1,331,484.14.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required json format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '1331484.14'}}\n```",
