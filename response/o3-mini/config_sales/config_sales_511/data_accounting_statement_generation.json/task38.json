                        "content": "We must “build” the ending balance in accounts receivable by “accumulating” all those sales and interest entries that were done on credit (that is, whose “receive method” is recorded as “Account Receivable” or – in the case of interest – shows “Interest receviable”). (Remember that an increase in a balance‐sheet asset “uses” cash in the cash‐flow statement and so is reported with a minus sign.) \n\nStep‑by‑step we go through the “Sale” transactions that are not paid immediately in cash. (Note that many sale records list “Cash” as their receive method so they are not “on credit” and do not add to accounts receivable.) In our data the following “Sale” rows have a “receive method” of “Account Receivable” (or similar) and their “after_tax_amount” amounts are as follows:\n\n1. Sale20240105015:      33040.89 \n2. Sale20240107027:      170384.15 \n3. Sale20240107028:      36777.63 \n4. Sale20240107030:      27675.52 \n5. Sale20240110039:      92884.70 \n6. Sale20240110040:      80867.93 \n7. Sale20240110041:      16568.77 \n8. Sale20240114057:      255267.66 \n9. Sale20240114058:      56353.02 \n10. Sale20240115063:     71259.90 \n11. Sale20240121085:     16922.07 \n12. Sale20240124094:     163359.15 \n13. Sale20240124095:     92940.13 \n14. Sale20240125099:     37874.56 \n15. Sale20240126105:     275061.00 \n\nSumming these “credit‐sales” we get a subtotal of approximately\n\n  33040.89 + 170384.15 + 36777.63 + 27675.52 + 92884.70 + 80867.93 + 16568.77 + 255267.66 + 56353.02 + 71259.90 + 16922.07 + 163359.15 + 92940.13 + 37874.56 + 275061.00 \n  ≈ 1,426,237.08\n\nAlso note that several “Interest” transactions have a “receive method” indicating “Interest receviable.” (These too are amounts that have not yet been collected in cash and so add to accounts receivable.) The unpaid interest rows (with “Unpaid” status) and their amounts (taken from the “amount” or “recorded_amount” field) are approximately:\n\n  417.41, 379.14, 340.97, 340.97, 340.97, 340.97, 330.29, 330.29, 330.29, 330.29, 323.17, 323.17, 323.17, 313.78, 313.78, 313.78, 313.78, 303.29, 303.29, 303.29, 303.29, 299.28, 299.28, 272.58, 272.58, 268.13, 261.55\n\nWhen summed these give approximately 8,592.81.\n\nThen the ending accounts receivable balance is the sum of credit sales and interest receivable:\n  1,426,237.08 + 8,592.81 ≈ 1,434,829.89\n\nSince an increase in an asset is reported as a “use of cash” (i.e. a negative change) on the statement of cash flows, we show the result with a minus sign.\n\nThus the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-1434829.89\"\n}\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format. \n\nFinal answer:\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-1434829.89'}}",
