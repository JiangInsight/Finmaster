All “Sale”‐type records were summed (using their “amount” field) to arrive at a total “Main Business Revenue” (which here equals “Total Revenue”).\n2. The “cost_amount” values from all sales were added – giving the cost of goods sold (COGS) and “Total Cost.”\n3. The gross profit is computed as revenue minus COGS.\n4. Operating expenses were grouped into administrative (e.g. “Administrative Expenses”), selling (e.g. “Sales Expenses”), plus the depreciation expense and the “Financial Expenses” (separately recorded as expense records) and then summed into “Total Expenses.”\n5. All the positive “Interest Receivables” entries were added to yield “Interest Income.”\n6. Profit before tax is gross profit minus total operating expenses plus interest income.\n7. By assuming an (approximate) tax rate of 20%, the tax expense was computed as about 20% of profit before tax; subtracting this yields the net profit.\n8. The numbers have been rounded to two–decimal places.\n\nThe figures above are obtained by a careful line–by–line aggregate of the provided transactions data. (Actual totals depend on how one allocates each transaction to the proper income‐statement category.)",
