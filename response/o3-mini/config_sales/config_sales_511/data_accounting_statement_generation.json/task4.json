                        "content": "We assume that at “time‐zero” (the “Initial” entries) no receivables exist. Then we “build up” the AR balance by “adding in” all sales that were not collected in cash (that is, those recorded with receive_method “Account Receviable”) plus any “interest receivable” that has not yet been paid. In our data the entries that affect AR are as follows:\n\n• Among the Sale transactions only those whose “receive_method” is “Account Receviable” contribute to AR. (Sales made for “Cash” are assumed already collected.) In our file these sales are:\n\n – Sale20240105015 – amount 34,779.88  \n – Sale20240107027 – amount 179,351.74  \n – Sale20240107028 – amount 38,713.30  \n – Sale20240107030 – amount 29,132.13  \n – Sale20240110039 – amount 97,773.37  \n – Sale20240110040 – amount 85,124.14  \n – Sale20240110041 – amount 17,440.81  \n – Sale20240114057 – amount 268,702.80  \n – Sale20240114058 – amount 59,318.97  \n – Sale20240115063 – amount 75,010.42  \n – Sale20240121085 – amount 17,812.71  \n – Sale20240124094 – amount 171,957.00  \n – Sale20240124095 – amount 97,831.72  \n – Sale20240125099 – amount 39,867.96  \n – Sale20240126105 – amount 289,537.89\n\nWhen these are summed we obtain a “sales‐AR” total of about 1,502,354.84.\n\n• Also, several “Interest Receivables” entries (each recorded with the “Interest receviable” marker and status Unpaid) add to AR. Their recorded amounts are (in the order they appear):\n\n 1. 340.97  \n 2. 340.97  \n 3. 330.29  \n 4. 330.29  \n 5. 330.29  \n 6. 330.29  \n 7. 323.17  \n 8. 323.17  \n 9. 323.17  \n 10. 313.78  \n 11. 313.78  \n 12. 313.78  \n 13. 313.78  \n 14. 303.29  \n 15. 303.29  \n 16. 303.29  \n 17. 303.29  \n 18. 299.28  \n 19. 299.28  \n 20. 272.58  \n 21. 272.58  \n 22. 268.13  \n 23. 261.55\n\nWhen summed the “interest‐AR” total comes to about 7,114.32.\n\n• No receipt (payment against AR) has been recorded in the file.\n\nThus, starting from an initial AR of 0.00 the “final” AR is\n\n  1,502,354.84 + 7,114.32 = 1,509,469.16\n\nAccordingly the answer is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"1509469.16\"} }",
