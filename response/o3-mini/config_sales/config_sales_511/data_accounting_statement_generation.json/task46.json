The first is a cash deposit for 3,000,000.0, the second is a bank deposit for 5,000,000.0, and the third (Fixed Assets) is not included as it is an asset purchase rather than available cash. Adding the cash deposit and bank deposit gives 3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 = 8,000,000.0. This is the beginning cash and cash equivalents balance.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\"} }\n```",
