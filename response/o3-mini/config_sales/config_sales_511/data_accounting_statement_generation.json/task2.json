In our data the “Initial20231231001” row with type “Bank deposit” shows an opening balance of 5,000,000.00.\n\nNext we must adjust the bank‐deposit account for those transactions that were actually paid “by bank transfer” (that is, those in which the “payment_method” is “Bank Transfer”). In our filing only outflows from the bank are posted (there is no “cash‐to‐bank transfer” in this set). In other words, every payment made “by Bank Transfer” reduces the cash in bank.\n\nBelow are the rows from the table that use “Bank Transfer” as their payment method and the amount paid (which we “subtract” from the bank balance):\n\n1. Purchase20231231001: 160,000.00  \n2. Purchase20231231002: 50,000.00  \n3. Purchase20231231003: 100,000.00  \n4. Purchase20231231005: 350,000.00  \n5. Purchase20231231006: 80,000.00  \n6. FixedAsset20231231001 (first fixed asset purchase): 256,859.19  \n7. FixedAsset20231231001 (second fixed asset purchase): 171,985.91  \n8. Purchase20231231008: 120,000.00  \n9. Purchase20231231011: 1,450,000.00  \n10. Purchase20231231016: 25,000.00  \n11. Purchase20231231017: 25,000.00  \n12. Purchase20231231023: 45,000.00  \n13. Purchase20231231024: 300,000.00  \n14. Purchase20231231026: 50,000.00  \n\nLet’s add these amounts step‐by‐step:\n\n• 160,000.00 + 50,000.00  = 210,000.00  \n• 210,000.00 + 100,000.00  = 310,000.00  \n• 310,000.00 + 350,000.00  = 660,000.00  \n• 660,000.00 + 80,000.00   = 740,000.00  \n• 740,000.00 + 256,859.19 = 996,859.19  \n• 996,859.19 + 171,985.91 = 1,168,845.10  \n• 1,168,845.10 + 120,000.00 = 1,288,845.10  \n• 1,288,845.10 + 1,450,000.00 = 2,738,845.10  \n• 2,738,845.10 + 25,000.00 = 2,763,845.10  \n• 2,763,845.10 + 25,000.00 = 2,788,845.10  \n• 2,788,845.10 + 45,000.00 = 2,833,845.10  \n• 2,833,845.10 + 300,000.00 = 3,133,845.10  \n• 3,133,845.10 + 50,000.00 = 3,183,845.10  \n\nThus the total outflow by bank transfer is 3,183,845.10.\n\nFinally, the final bank deposit balance is computed as\n\n  Final Bank Deposit = Opening Bank Deposit – Total Bank Transfer Outflows  \n    = 5,000,000.00 – 3,183,845.10  \n    ≈ 1,816,154.90\n\nThus our answer is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"1816154.90\"\n  }\n}",
