                        "content": "We have to “re‐construct” what has happened to the company’s accounts payable during the reporting period. In our books only purchases recorded as “Purchase” that have not been paid (that is, whose “payment/receipt_status” is Unpaid and whose payment_method is “Account Payable”) will result in an increase of accounts payable.\n\nBelow is how we can “build” the result step‐by‐step:\n\n1. In the provided table many transactions are “Purchase” transactions. In most cases the purchases were “Paid” via cash, bank transfer, etc. Only those purchases that were recorded as “Unpaid” (with payment method “Account Payable”) form a liability on the books (i.e. increase Accounts Payable).\n\n2. By going through the rows you will see (by their id) that the only Purchase transactions that affect the Accounts Payable account are the following:\n • Purchase20231231009 – type “Purchase”, amount = 60,000.0, “Unpaid” and payment_method = “Account Payable”\n • Purchase20231231013 – type “Purchase”, amount = 250,000.0, “Unpaid” (payment_method = “Account Payable”)\n • Purchase20231231015 – type “Purchase”, amount = 80,000.0, “Unpaid” (payment_method = “Account Payable”)\n • Purchase20231231018 – type “Purchase”, amount = 60,000.0, “Unpaid” (payment_method = “Account Payable”)\n\n3. Summing these figures:\n 60,000.0 + 250,000.0 = 310,000.0\n 310,000.0 + 80,000.0 = 390,000.0\n 390,000.0 + 60,000.0 = 450,000.0\n\n4. No other transactions affect the final balance of Accounts Payable because the other purchases were paid immediately (or by bank transfer or cash) and therefore do not change the liability at period‐end.\n\nThus, the “Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable” is an increase of 450,000.00.\n\nBelow is our answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"450000.00\"} }",
