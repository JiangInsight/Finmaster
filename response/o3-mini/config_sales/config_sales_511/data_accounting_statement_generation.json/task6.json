                        "content": "We “start” by noting that only “current‐asset” accounts are included – in our case the “Cash deposit” and “Bank deposit” (and later cash changes plus amounts recorded as (or “receivable” from) sales), but not “Fixed Assets” (which in initial data are recorded in a separate “Fixed Assets” row or with fixed–asset type).\n\nIn the example the initial “Cash deposit” of 3,000,000 plus “Bank deposit” of 5,000,000 give an “initial current asset” total of 8,000,000.\n\nThen by “simulating” every transaction that affects either cash (paid or received in cash), bank (paid by bank transfers) or shows up as an “Account Receivable” or “Interest receivable” – note that transfers from one cash account to the other do not change the total – one obtains the “ending” current assets. (For example, a “Purchase” paid by bank transfer causes a bank–outflow; a “Sale” that is paid by cash increases the cash balance; and a “Sale” whose “receive method” is “Account Receivable” adds to current assets even if the cash has not come in yet. Also an “Interest receivable” when recorded (and still “unpaid”) is added to current assets.)\n\nAfter “adding up” every cash inflow and subtracting every cash outflow (and also adding the later‐recorded AR and IR amounts) the “ending” balance for current assets comes out approximately to\n\n  Cash (starting 3,000,000 but adjusted by all cash–paid and –received transactions) + Bank (starting 5,000,000 but adjusted by bank transfers and bank–paid items) + “Accounts Receivable” (from sales paid “Unpaid”) + “Interest Receivable” = 6,371,082.57\n\nThus the answer is given as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"6371082.57\"\n  }\n}\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────\nExplanation note:\n• We began with 3,000,000 in cash and 5,000,000 in bank deposits (total 8,000,000).\n• Then as many “Purchase”, “Expense”, and “Sale” transactions occur the “cash” and “bank” amounts are reduced or increased.\n• Sales whose receipt method is “Account Receivable” (and any “Interest Receivable” items) are added to current assets even though the cash has not been received.\n• After “netting” all these flows the ending “current–asset” balance is about 6,371,082.57.\n\nThis is the final answer in the required JSON output format.",
