                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” the ending “L+OE” by noting that the balance‐sheet “left‐side” is created by the “Initial” injections and then “adjusted” during the period by two things:\n• the (net) operating result – that is, the income “generated” (from sales) minus the various outgoings (expenses, depreciation, etc)\n• plus any “purchases” taken “on credit” (i.e. those not paid out of cash) that do not reduce current funds but instead show up as liabilities.\n\nIn our example the three “Initial” rows add to\n\n  3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 13,000,000.00\n\nThen, by “reading” the remainder of the transactions we see that many sales come with a “profit” (which is already computed on every sale row – for example the sale with id Sale20240102002 shows a profit of about 16,215.84, and so on) and if we add up all the “profit” columns from every “Sale” row we obtain approximately 2,700,660.68. (This total gathers – in effect – the “operating income” earned during the period.) At the same time, many “Expense”‐type transactions (in which also “Depreciation” is included) reduce net income. Adding up every “Expense” row (by type Administrative, Sales, Financial, etc) plus the single Depreciation row gives a “total expense” of about 1,315,153.30. (All amounts are given at full precision; we later round to two decimals.) Thus the “net income” accumulated during the period is roughly\n\n  2,700,660.68 – 1,315,153.30 = 1,385,507.38.\n\nIn addition, not every purchase was paid in cash. (When a purchase is “Paid” the cash asset decreases and Owner’s Equity stays unchanged; but if the purchase is “Unpaid” it shows up as a liability.) In our “Purchase” rows the ones marked Unpaid are (with their amounts):\n\n  Purchase20231231009 = 60,000.00  \n  Purchase20231231013 = 250,000.00  \n  Purchase20231231018 = 60,000.00\n\nso the “unpaid‐purchases” total 60,000 + 250,000 + 60,000 = 370,000.00. (Had these purchases been paid the cash account – and hence ultimately the “Assets” – would have been reduced; but here the “credit” means an increase in liabilities while the “profit” calculation is not affected.)\n\nThen the ending total “Liabilities plus Owner’s Equity” equals\n\n  Initial + (Net operating result) + (Unpaid purchase increase)\n    = 13,000,000.00 + 1,385,507.38 + 370,000.00\n    = 14,755,507.38\n\nThus, our answer is as follows.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"14755507.38\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote: In our “step‐by‐step” exercise we relied on the fact that (“profit” – as recorded on each “Sale” row – already subtracts the cost of goods sold) while the “Expense” rows (including depreciation) capture the period’s operating outlays. Then the “net income” is the difference of the two sums; and (only) those purchases that remain “unpaid” add to liabilities. This is the reasoning behind the final number.",
