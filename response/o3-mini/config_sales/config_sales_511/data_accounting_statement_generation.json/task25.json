In our trial‐data the “Sale” transactions (all rows whose “type” is “Sale”) already include a “profit” field which (by definition in this system) is the difference between the after–tax sales amount and the cost occupied by that sale. (That is, for a sale the “profit” is computed as after_tax_amount – cost_amount.) Therefore, to compute the final gross profit we simply add up the profit fields for every sale transaction.\n\nBelow is a brief sketch of the calculation:\n\n1. Identify every row whose type is “Sale”. (For example, the row with id “Sale20240102002” has profit ≈16,215.84 and so on.)\n2. Sum up the “profit” values. (When we add up all the sale–line profits from our provided table the total comes out approximately to 2,545,589.48.)\n3. The final “Gross Profit” item shown on the income statement is therefore 2,545,589.48.\n\nThus the answer is as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Gross Profit\": \"2545589.48\"}}\n``` \n\nThis is our calculated final gross profit based on the provided transactions data.",
