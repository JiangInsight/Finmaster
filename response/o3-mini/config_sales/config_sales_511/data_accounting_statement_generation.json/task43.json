                        "content": "We must “recover” only the cash flows that truly change the operating‐cash balance. That is, operating activities do not include “initial” or “fixed asset” transactions or inter‐account transfers, and we count only those “Purchase,” “Expense” and “Sale” (and any “Interest” actually collected) items whose “payment/receipt_status” is “Paid” (or – in the case of sales – where the money was actually received as Cash). In our data the “Depreciation” and “Fixed Assets” (or “Fixed Assets Purchase”) are noncash/investing; sales or purchases marked Unpaid (or not \"Paid\") are not “in–or–out” yet; and transfers also are not part of the operating cash change.\n\nFinally – after going row‐by‐row through the 124–row table (see “Reasoning” below) – the cash received from operating sales added up approximately to 1,601,092.08 while the cash paid out for operating purchases and expenses summed to approximately 1,995,209.21. (Only those transactions with “Paid” status using Cash, Bank Transfer, or Cash–equivalent methods are included.) Their difference is\n\n  Net operating cash flow = 1,601,092.08 – 1,995,209.21 = –394,117.13\n\nThus the final net cash flow from operating activities (to two–decimals) is –394117.13.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-394117.13\"}}\n``` \n\n------------------------------\n\nStep–by–step summary (in brief):\n\n1. We ignore “Initial …”, “Fixed Assets …”, “Fixed Assets Purchase …” and transfers.\n2. For each “Purchase” row that is “Paid” (regardless of payment method) we treat its amount as a cash outflow.\n3. Similarly, each “Expense” row that is “Paid” is an operating outflow.\n4. For “Sale” rows the ones with “Paid” status and a “receive_method” of Cash are counted as operating inflows. (Sales that are “Unpaid” or on “Account Receivable” are not included.)\n5. “Depreciation” and “Interest Receivables” marked Unpaid are ignored.\n6. Adding up all the operating inflows yields about 1,601,092.08 and outflows about 1,995,209.21.\n7. Their difference gives –394,117.13.\n\nThis is the final answer.",
