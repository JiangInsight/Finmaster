                        "content": "We “determine” the tax‐liability by (a) noticing that none of the “initial” opening‐entries show a tax amount so that the opening “taxes payable” is zero and (b) that in our “sale” transactions each sale row (and only the sales rows) shows a “tax_amount” value that is “added” to the liabilities. In our current problem the many sales rows have a “tax_amount” as given in the table. (For example, one sale shows a tax_amount of 1810.79; another shows 2956.22; another 998.49; and so on.) By summing up all the tax_amount values from the sale‐transactions we obtain a final “taxes payable” value. (This is exactly what was done in the sample problem – the starting value of taxes payable was 0.00 and after summing the various tax amounts for the sale transactions the ending liability was computed.) \n\nStep‐by step (grouping many sales together) the sum of the “tax_amount” figures from all the sale transactions is computed as follows:\n\n Group1 (rows 1–5): 1810.79 + 2956.22 + 998.49 + 3638.25 + 3720.32 = 13,124.07  \n Group2 (rows 6–10): 1747.25 + 1761.05 + 3866.39 + 1738.99 + 5989.72 = 15,103.40  \n Group3 (rows 11–15): 910.50 + 8781.98 + 9010.23 + 436.19 + 1748.84 = 20,887.74  \n Group4 (rows 16–20): 8967.59 + 1935.67 + 914.84 + 1456.61 + 885.93 = 14,160.64  \n Group5 (rows 21–25): 5153.67 + 1902.58 + 2954.99 + 443.51 + 4888.67 = 15,343.42  \n Group6 (rows 26–30): 4256.21 + 872.04 + 1413.27 + 9823.45 + 9186.14 = 25,551.11  \n Group7 (rows 31–35): 1976.60 + 906.85 + 5123.21 + 1770.31 + 5457.36 = 15,234.33  \n Group8 (rows 36–40): 2597.76 + 13435.14 + 2965.95 + 4289.37 + 9002.98 = 32,291.20  \n Group9 (rows 41–45): 14401.75 + 3750.52 + 499.60 + 966.56 + 903.10 = 20,521.53  \n Group10 (rows 46–50): 452.58 + 9881.36 + 1869.41 + 2918.76 + 9408.87 = 24,530.98  \n Group11 (rows 51–55): 13186.36 + 1951.72 + 916.33 + 2684.40 + 1760.95 = 20,499.76  \n Group12 (rows 56–60): 1391.33 + 4272.96 + 890.64 + 461.49 + 498.68 = 7,515.10  \n Group13 (rows 61–65): 921.87 + 8597.85 + 4891.59 + 8836.00 + 1993.40 = 25,240.71  \n Group14 (rows 66–70): 1415.67 + 1456.68 + 1370.52 + 14476.89 + 4885.15 = 23,604.91  \n Group15 (row 71): 4670.60\n\nWhen we sum over all groups the result is:\n 13,124.07 + 15,103.40 + 20,887.74 + 14,160.64 + 15,343.42 + 25,551.11 + 15,234.33 + 32,291.20 + 20,521.53 + 24,530.98 + 20,499.76 + 7,515.10 + 25,240.71 + 23,604.91 + 4,670.60 ≈ 277,279.50\n\nThus the “initial” taxes payable is 0.00 and after processing all sales the “taxes payable” at period end is about 277,279.50.\n\nThe answer is then presented in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"277279.50\"\n  }\n}",
