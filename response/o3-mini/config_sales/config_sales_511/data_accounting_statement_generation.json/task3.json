                        "content": "We “materialize” our “inventory” as the cost (in monetary terms) that has been added via product‐purchases minus what has been “used up” by sales (where each sale entry shows the “cost_amount” used to record the cost of goods sold). In our “time period” the beginning inventory is assumed to be zero (since the “Initial” entries concern cash, banks or fixed assets rather than stock of products). Then, for every transaction with type “Purchase” that carries a product id the “inventory additions” come from (quantity × cost_per_unit). (Note: Some purchase rows come with an “amount” but we use the unit cost in the “cost_per_unit” column multiplied by the quantity.) Also every “Sale” transaction that carries a product id includes a “cost_amount” – we assume that this represents the cost of the product sold and so is deducted from inventory.\n\nStep by step we did the following:\n\n1. From the provided new data we ignore the initial “Initial…” rows (cash, bank, fixed assets) and all non–product transactions.\n2. We “scan” the “Purchase” rows (those with type “Purchase” and a nonempty product_id) and add up the incoming inventory value. For example:\n  • Purchase20231231001 (P003, Premium Product C): 8 × 20,000 = 160,000  \n  • Purchase20231231002 (P001, Premium Product A): 10 × 5,000 = 50,000  \n  • Purchase20231231003 (P002, Premium Product B): 10 × 10,000 = 100,000  \n  • … and so on; when we add all such “Purchase” additions we get a total of 3,469,000.\n3. Then we “scan” each “Sale” row having a product_id and use its reported “cost_amount” (which is the cost of the inventory that left the warehouse). (For instance: Sale20240102002 contributes 20,000; Sale20240102003 contributes 30,000; Sale20240102004 contributes 10,000; etc.) When summed up over the period the total “cost_amount” reduced is 3,405,000.\n4. Thus, the ending inventory is simply (total purchased value – total cost sold) = 3,469,000 – 3,405,000 = 64,000.\n\nSince there were no initial inventory items carried over (the “Initial” transactions did not include any product-stock amounts), the inventory initial value is 0.\n\nThe final answer is therefore:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Inventory End Value\": \"64000.00\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis is our answer in the requested JSON format.",
