In this case we only add the rows whose “type” starts with “Expense” (in addition to the “Depreciation” line which in an income statement is normally shown as an expense). We ignore purchase, sale, interest receivable, fixed assets, etc.\n\nBelow we show a step‐by‐step list of the “expense‐group” rows (using the “amount” field) and then add them all:\n\n1.
