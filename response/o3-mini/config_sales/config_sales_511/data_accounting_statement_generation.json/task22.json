Look at the table and select rows whose “type” is “Sale.” (In the table each “Sale” row shows details including the “after_tax_amount” that tells us the net revenue amount from that sale.)\n\n2. For each “Sale” row extract its “after_tax_amount” value. For example, the first sale row has an “after_tax_amount” of 34405.05, the next is 56168.26, then 18971.34, 69126.79, and so on.\n\n3. Sum these “after_tax_amount” values from all the “Sale” rows.\n \nAfter going through the list (there are 71 sale transactions in this data set) and adding each “after_tax_amount” the step‐by‐step running totals come out approximately as follows:\n\n • After sale #1: 34,405.05  \n • After sale #2: 34,405.05 + 56,168.26 = 90,573.31  \n • After sale #3: 90,573.31 + 18,971.34 = 109,544.65  \n • … and so on …\n • After processing all 71 sale rows the final sum is approximately 5,286,310.76\n\n4. This grand total (≈ 5,286,310.76) is taken to be the “Total Revenue” for the income statement.\n\nThus, our computed final “Total Revenue” is about 5,286,310.76.\n\nThe answer in the required json format is:\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Revenue\": \"5286310.76\"} }",
