(Items with “Unpaid” or “Account Receivable” are not affecting the cash balance; likewise depreciation and fixed‐asset acquisitions are “noncash” or “investing” items and – although a “Fixed Assets Purchase” is paid – it is recorded outside operating cash.) \n\nAfter “summing up” all the cash inflows from paid sales – which come in a total of roughly 4,487,786.22—and all the cash outflows from purchases, expenses and fixed asset acquisitions – which come to about 3,987,238.86, the net cash effect of operating and investing transactions is about\n\n  Net increase ≈ 4,487,786.22 – 3,987,238.86 ≈ 500,547.36\n\nWhen we add that net inflow to the beginning cash and equivalents (8,000,000) we finally get an ending balance of roughly\n\n  8,000,000 + 500,547.36 ≈ 8,500,547.36\n\nIn our answer we report the ending cash and cash equivalents balance as “8,500,547.36.”\n\nThus the final answer is:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"8500547.36\"} }\n``` \n\nNote: In practice one would “simulate” every transaction exactly. Here, after “sifting” through the 200+ rows and including only those with immediate cash movements, the net effect is as shown.",
