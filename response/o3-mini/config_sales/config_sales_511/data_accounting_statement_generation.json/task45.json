                        "content": "We need to identify only those cash flows that are “investing activities.” In our source table only transactions related to acquiring (or disposing) of long‑term assets (such as fixed assets) count as investing cash flows. Although an initial “Fixed Assets” record is shown (in an “Initial…Fixed Assets” row), that is simply used to set up the balance and is not part of the investing cash flows for the period. Instead we must include only the transactions that involve the purchase (or sale) of fixed assets during the period – typically those recorded with a type such as “Fixed Assets Purchase.”\n\nIn the provided data the only rows associated with long‑term asset investments (other than the initial setup) are those with type “Fixed Assets Purchase.” Scanning through the table we find the following fixed asset purchase transactions (always with a “Paid” status, meaning cash outflow):\n\n1. Row with id “FixedAsset20231231001” – type “Fixed Assets Purchase” with amount = 256859.19  \n2. Another “FixedAsset20231231001” row – type “Fixed Assets Purchase” with amount = 171985.91  \n3. A later “FixedAsset20231231001” row with amount = 55577.41  \n4. Then a “FixedAsset20231231001” row with amount = 73932.79  \n5. Finally, a “FixedAsset20231231001” row with amount = 117840.57\n\nNone of the other rows (even though many “Purchase” transactions appear) are for fixed assets – they are for inventory or supplies.\n\nSince all these fixed asset acquisitions represent cash outflows due to investing activities, we just add their amounts and then take the negative value (because cash is going out).\n\nLet’s add them:\n • 256859.19  \n • + 171985.91 = 428845.10  \n • + 55577.41 = 484422.51  \n • + 73932.79 = 558355.30  \n • + 117840.57 = 676195.87\n\nSince these are cash outflows the net cash flow from investing activities is –\n676195.87.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-676195.87\"\n  }\n}",
