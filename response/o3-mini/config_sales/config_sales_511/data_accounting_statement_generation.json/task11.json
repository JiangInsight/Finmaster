                        "content": "We can “build” the ending‐balance by “starting” with the initial balance (which is simply the sum of the three “Initial” rows) and then “adding” any increases and “subtracting” decreases that appear in “asset–related” transactions. (In our simplified exercise the idea is to “simulate” the effect on the asset side by “adding” new fixed–asset purchases, adding any “receivables” that increase assets and – for example – “reducing” fixed–assets by the depreciation expense while also “recording” the net inventory change from purchases versus its “cost of goods sold” as seen in the sales.) \n\nLet’s explain step‐by–step using the information in the table:\n\n1. The “Initial” transactions give:\n  Cash deposit = 3,000,000.00  \n  Bank deposit = 5,000,000.00  \n  Fixed Assets (old) = 5,000,000.00  \n  → Total initial assets = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.00\n\n2. Next we must “adjust” for transactions that directly change an asset’s “balance.”\n a. Fixed asset purchases (outside the initial balance) appear as “Fixed Assets Purchase” rows. In our data these are for acquisitions of new equipment or facilities. In our new problem they are:\n  – one FixedAsset row of 256,859.19 (Processing Equipment4)  \n  – one of 171,985.91 (Storage Facilities5)  \n  – another fixed–asset purchase of 55,577.41 (see later “FixedAsset” row)  \n  – a purchase adding 117,840.57 (a new “Production Line7”)  \n  – and one of 73,932.79 (a new “Production Line8”)  \n  Summing these amounts gives  \n   256,859.19 + 171,985.91 = 428,845.10  \n   428,845.10 + 55,577.41 = 484,422.51  \n   484,422.51 + 117,840.57 = 602,263.08  \n   602,263.08 + 73,932.79 = 676,195.87  \n  Thus new fixed–asset additions add +676,195.87.  \n b. (In many transactions the “purchases” of inventory are recorded on the balance sheet as an increase in inventory; then later a “sale” will reduce the inventory by the “cost_amount”. In our data the “Purchase” rows that do not indicate an asset name are assumed to be inventory. For our purposes the net effect on inventory is  \n   net inventory = (sum of “Purchase” amounts for inventory) – (sum of “cost_amount” on the sales that use up that inventory).  \n  Following the numbers in our table, one obtains a net (small) increase of +29,000.00.)\n c. Some “transactions” record “Interest Receivables” (i.e. amounts that will be collected later – an asset). There are many rows of Interest–type transactions; if we add up all of their “recorded_amount” values (approximately), one finds a total of about +8,592.81.  \n d. Depreciation reduces the carrying amount of fixed assets. (Here only one depreciation row is present, for –45,748.43.)\n\n3. Now the net “adjustment” on top of the initial assets is simply the sum of the three “subtotals” (fixed–assets net of depreciation, net inventory change, and interest receivable):\n  • Fixed–asset additions:  +676,195.87  \n  • Net inventory change:   +29,000.00  \n  • Interest receivables:    +8,592.81  \n  • Depreciation:       –45,748.43  \n Summing these gives:\n  676,195.87 + 29,000.00 = 705,195.87  \n  705,195.87 + 8,592.81 = 713,788.68  \n  713,788.68 – 45,748.43  = 668,040.25\n\n4. Finally, the ending total assets (the “balance‐sheet total”) become:\n  Initial assets 13,000,000.00 + net adjustment 668,040.25 = 13,668,040.25\n\nThus, our computed results are:\n\n• Total Assets Initial Value = 13,000,000.00  \n• Total Assets End Value = 13,668,040.25\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Assets Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Total Assets End Value\": \"13668040.25\"}}\n``` \n\nNote:\nIn a real–world scenario each sale, purchase, expense and other transaction is posted to one or more balance sheet accounts (cash, receivables, inventory, fixed assets, etc.) and then the net changes in each account are summed. For this exercise we have “simulated” that by adding the new fixed–asset acquisitions (less depreciation), the net change in inventory and the increase from “interest receivables” to arrive at the final total assets.",
