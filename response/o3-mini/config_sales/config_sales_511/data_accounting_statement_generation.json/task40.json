                        "content": "We can “back‐into” the inventory change (usually reported in the operating activities, as a use of cash if inventory rose) by noting that the overall change in our inventory balance comes from the cost of inventory purchased – the cost of inventory “used up” in the sales (that is, the cost of goods sold). In our books the purchases (for “inventory items”) are recorded on “Purchase” transactions and their cost is given by their “amount” field, while the “Sale” transactions have a “cost_amount” (the cost of the sold items). (Other types – like fixed‑asset purchases – are not “inventory” so we ignore them.)\n\nStep‑by‑step we do the following:\n\n1. From all the “Purchase”–type lines (those that have product_id “P001”, “P002”, “P003” or “P004” and product names beginning with “Premium Product …”) we add up the amounts:\n  • Purchase20231231001: 160,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231002:  50,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231003: 100,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231004: 250,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231005: 350,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231006:  80,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231007:  90,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231008: 120,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231009:  60,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231010: 100,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231011:  80,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231012: 200,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231013: 250,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231014:  60,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231015:  80,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231016:  25,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231017:  25,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231018:  60,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231019: 400,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231020:  60,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231021: 100,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231022: 350,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231023:  45,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231024: 300,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231025:  15,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231026:  50,000.00 \nWhen summed these add up to 3,469,000.00.\n\n2. Next, we add (over all Sale–type lines that are for our inventory items) the “cost_amount” recorded on sale lines. (For example, one sale reads “… | 20000.0 | 16215.84 …” where the 20,000 is the cost; others record things like 30,000.00, 10,000.00, etc.) When we add up every sale’s “cost_amount” we obtain a total of 2,970,000.00.\n\n3. Therefore the change in inventory is:\n  Final Inventory (in cost terms) = Total Purchases – Cost of Goods Sold \n    = 3,469,000.00 – 2,970,000.00 \n    = 499,000.00\n\nIn the indirect cash‐flow statement an increase in inventory is a use of cash. Thus the “(Increase) Decrease in Inventory” is reported as –499,000.00.\n\nPresenting the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-499000.00\"} }",
