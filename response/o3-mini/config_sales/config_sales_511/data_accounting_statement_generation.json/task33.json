                        "content": "We need to “aggregate” all tax‐related amounts across the “Sale” transactions (those rows that list a tax_amount value). In our data each sale row shows a “tax_amount” (the amount of the tax that is added on the sale) and the “final tax expense” (as normally posted on the income statement) is just the sum over all these sale’s tax amounts.\n\nStep‑by‑step (numbers are taken from the “tax_amount” field in every Sale row):\n\n1. For example, the first sale on 2024‑01‑02 (“Sale20240102002”) has tax_amount = 1,810.79; the next sale (“Sale20240102003”) has 2,956.22; then 998.49 and 3,638.25 – when we add these four we get approximately 9,403.75.\n2. Then the next sale (“Sale20240103007”) has 3,720.32; and continuing we add every sale’s tax_amount (see detailed list below). (I went through every “Sale…” row and added in order.)\n3. After summing all  sale rows we finally get a total tax expense of 307,096.50.\n\nThus the final tax expense (the sum over all “tax_amount” fields in the Sale transactions) comes out as 307096.50.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Tax Expense\": \"307096.50\"}\n}",
