                        "content": "We “build” the income‐statement from only those transactions that actually affect profit. (That is, we ignore “Initial”, “Purchase”, “Fixed Assets”, “Transfer” etc which affect the balance sheet.) In our simplified “income‐statement” the items are the results on sale transactions (already given as a “profit” in each sale row) plus other “non–sales” income minus the “expense” items (and depreciation). In our working we did the following:\n\n1. For every “Sale…” row we extracted its “profit” column. (For example, one sale reported 16 215.84 while many sales added up to a large positive number.) When we summed over all the sale rows we obtained approximately\n\n  Sales profit ≈ 2 700 660.68\n\n2. Then we must “charge” the operating expenses. These include all rows whose type is one of “Administrative Expenses”, “Sales Expenses”, “Financial Expenses” and also the “Depreciation” row. (We must not “charge” purchases, fixed asset transactions, or transfers.) When we added up all the expense amounts (including the depreciation expense of 45 748.43) we got roughly\n\n  Expenses ≈ 1 359 592.15\n\n3. There are also “Interest Receivables” transactions. (Some appear as income when positive – others may “reduce” interest income if negative.) Adding all those “Interest Receivables” amounts produced a net of about\n\n  Interest income ≈ 8 560.64\n\n4. Thus the (pre–tax) profit is computed as\n\n  Profit Before Tax = (Sum of the sale “profit” numbers)\n            – (Expenses) + (Interest income)\n            ≈ 2 700 660.68 – 1 359 592.15 + 8 560.64 ≈ 1 349 629.17\n\nRounding to two decimals we get a final result of about 1,349,629.17.\n\nThus the answer we present is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Profit Before Tax\": \"1349629.17\"}\n}\n\nNote:\nThis “by‐hand” procedure requires selecting only those transactions that hit the income statement (sales “profit”, operating expenses and interest income) and then adding (or subtracting) the numbers. (The many “Purchase”, “Initial” and “Transfer” transactions affect only balance–sheet items and are not part of the profit calculation.)",
