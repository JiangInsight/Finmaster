Note that the “Initial” transactions are not liabilities but asset contributions.\n\nLooking over the purchase‐type transactions in the list, we have the following ones with an “Unpaid” status:\n\n• Purchase20231231009 – amount 60,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231013 – amount 250,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231015 – amount 80,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231018 – amount 60,000.0  \n\nAdding these amounts gives:  \n 60,000.0 + 250,000.0 = 310,000.0  \n 310,000.0 + 80,000.0 = 390,000.0  \n 390,000.0 + 60,000.0 = 450,000.0\n\nNo other purchase (or expense) item produces a liability here; all others were marked “Paid” (and many “Interest Receivables” are assets rather than obligations).\n\nSince the “Initial” transactions were only asset accounts, the beginning (initial) current liabilities are zero.\n\nThus the current liabilities items are:\n Total Current Liabilities Initial Value  = 0.00  \n Total Current Liabilities End Value      = 450000.00\n\nWe now present the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"450000.00\"\n  }\n}",
