                        "content": "We must “back‐solve” the COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) from the transactions that belong to “sale” transactions – that is, the cost_amount that was “recorded” on every sale. (In our system the sale rows include a “cost_amount” field that represents the cost of the items that were sold.) \n\nThe way to “solve” the task is to scan through the “Sale” rows and add up the cost_amount for each. (Other transactions such as Purchases, Expenses, Initial deposits, Fixed Assets, etc. do not “consume” inventory and thus are not part of COGS.) \n\nBelow is one way to “work‐through” the solution:\n\n1. For each row whose “type” is “Sale” (for example, the row with id Sale20240102002, Sale20240102003, … etc) note the cost_amount value (which is the 22nd column) – these values are already provided in the data. \n\n2. For example, reviewing a few sales:\n  • Sale20240102002 has cost_amount = 20,000.00 \n  • Sale20240102003 has cost_amount = 30,000.00 \n  • Sale20240102004 has cost_amount = 10,000.00 \n  • Sale20240102005 has cost_amount = 40,000.00 \n  • … and so on.\n\n3. Proceed through the full list of sale transactions and sum their “cost_amount” values.\n\nA careful accounting (by grouping into batches for clarity) gives:\n\n • Rows 1–10 (first 10 sale transactions): 20,000 + 30,000 + 10,000 + 40,000 + 40,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 + 40,000 + 20,000 + 60,000 = 300,000  \n • Rows 11–20: 10,000 + 100,000 + 100,000 + 5,000 + 20,000 + 100,000 + 20,000 + 10,000 + 15,000 + 10,000 = 390,000  \n • Rows 21–30: 60,000 + 20,000 + 30,000 + 5,000 + 50,000 + 50,000 + 10,000 + 15,000 + 100,000 + 100,000 = 440,000  \n • Rows 31–40: 20,000 + 10,000 + 60,000 + 20,000 + 60,000 + 30,000 + 150,000 + 30,000 + 50,000 + 100,000 = 530,000  \n • Rows 41–50: 150,000 + 40,000 + 5,000 + 10,000 + 10,000 + 5,000 + 100,000 + 20,000 + 30,000 + 100,000 = 470,000  \n • Rows 51–60: 150,000 + 20,000 + 10,000 + 30,000 + 20,000 + 15,000 + 50,000 + 100,000 + 5,000 + 5,000 = 405,000  \n • Rows 61–67: 10,000 + 100,000 + 50,000 + 100,000 + 20,000 + 15,000 + 15,000 = 310,000  \n • Rows 68–71: 15,000 + 150,000 + 50,000 + 50,000 = 265,000  \n\nWhen you add these group totals the sum is:\n  300,000 + 390,000 + 440,000 + 530,000 + 470,000 + 405,000 + 310,000 + 265,000 = 3,110,000\n\nThus the final cost of goods sold is 3,110,000.00.\n\nWe now present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"3110000.00\"\n  }\n}",
