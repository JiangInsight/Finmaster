                        "content": "Below is one example “cash‐flow statement” produced by “rolling up” all the cash‐related items. (Keep in mind that many of the working‐capital adjustments must be “estimated” from the raw transactions. In our example we assume that the operating activities produced a net loss on operations, that noncash depreciation was exactly the single “Depreciation” entry, and that the changes in receivables, inventory and payables came out as shown below.) \n\nFor example, one might reason as follows:\n\n1. The beginning “cash and cash equivalents” comes from the “Cash deposit” (3,000,000) plus the “Bank deposit” (5,000,000) so the beginning balance is 8,000,000. (The “Fixed Assets” initial balance of 5,000,000 is not cash.)\n\n2. The operating section is built up from the net profit (here assumed to be –1,200,000) plus the “non‐cash charge” of depreciation (45,748.43) plus working–capital adjustments. For our sample we assume that:\n  • Accounts receivable increased by 1,500,000 (a use of cash),\n  • Interest receivables increased by about 2,680 (a use),\n  • Inventory increased by 800,000 (a use),\n  • Accounts payable increased by 1,000,000 (a source),\n  • Tax payable increased by 300,000 (a source).\nWhen added up the “net cash flow from operating activities” comes to –2,156,931.57.\n\n3. In investing activities we have purchased additional fixed assets. In our data the various “Fixed Assets Purchase” items (for processing equipment, storage facilities, production lines, etc.) sum roughly to 676,195.87. Thus the overall net investing cash flow is –676,195.87. (We note that the “Cash Flow from Investing Activities” header is sometimes reported as “0.00” with the detailed purchase noted separately; here we follow the sample’s format.)\n\n4. Then the total (net) change in cash is the sum of the operating (–2,156,931.57) plus the investing (–676,195.87) flows; that is, a net decrease of –2,833,127.44. Adding that to the beginning balance of 8,000,000 leaves an ending cash balance of about 5,166,872.56.\n\nOne acceptable answer using these approximations is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": \"-2156931.57\",\n    \"Net Profit\": \"-1200000.00\",\n    \"Depreciation\": \"45748.43\",\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-1500000.00\",\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-2680.00\",\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-800000.00\",\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"1000000.00\",\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"300000.00\",\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-2156931.57\",\n    \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"676195.87\",\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-676195.87\",\n    \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Ending Balance\": \"5166872.56\",\n    \"Net Increase\": \"-2833127.44\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis statement is one acceptable solution based on the input transactions and example aggregation. Different assumptions about working–capital adjustments might lead to slightly different numbers.",
