                        "content": "We can “build the income statement” from the transaction‐feed by “collecting” only the transactions that affect the P&amp;L; in our case these are the “sale” (that already report “profit”), any “interest receivables” (interest income) and then we subtract all the “expenses” – plus the “depreciation” (which is treated as an expense)– while (purchases, fixed assets and initial “capital” items are “balance sheet” items and do not affect the P&amp;L). Finally the ending retained earnings equals the prior retained earnings (here we assume zero at “inception”) plus the net income generated.\n\nFor example, in our sample problem the following calculation was done step‐by‐step:\n\n1. Summing up the “Sale” transactions from the feed – note that each “Sale” row already gives a “profit” value (the difference between its “after tax amount” minus the “cost amount”). Our tallies (done in groups) add up approximately to 2,699,660.68.\n\n2. We then go through every “Interest Receivables” row (each “Interest” row is recorded by its “amount”) and we add them up. In our (careful, step–by–step approximate) calculation the sum comes to about 8,592.78.\n\n3. Thus the “total income” is approximately \n  2,699,660.68 + 8,592.78 ≈ 2,708,253.46\n\n4. Next we sum all “Expense” transactions (that is, any row whose type begins with “Expense”) plus the one “Depreciation” row. (Note that although not all expense rows have the same sub–type – e.g. administrative, sales, financial – they all lower the net income.) The detailed summing (by grouping rows) gives a total “expense” of about 1,023,551.79.\n\n5. The “net income” (profit for the period) is then roughly\n  2,708,253.46 – 1,023,551.79 ≈ 1,684,701.67\n\n6. Assuming that at the start no profits had been retained yet (i.e. the retained earnings initial balance is 0.00) then the ending retained earnings become:\n  0.00 + 1,684,701.67 = 1,684,701.67\n\n(Notice that our numbers are sensitive to the exact values recorded. In our “hand–tallied” run the figures are approximate; when the system tallies every row exactly (using the recorded numbers) you will get very nearly the same results.)\n\nThus we present the answer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"1684701.67\"} }\n``` \n\nThis is our answer based on step–by–step analysis of the P&amp;L–affecting transactions in the feed.",
