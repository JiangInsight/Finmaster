                        "content": "Below is one “worked‐through” answer. (Note: In a real ERP‐system the many “Purchase”, “Sale”, “Expense”, “Depreciation” and “Interest” transactions would post into many subsidiary ledgers and update the “Control Accounts” so that the final balance‐sheet “numbers” come out by “netting” cash flows, inventory increases and decreases, cost of sales and depreciation, etc. In the following answer we assume that (a) the three “Initial” rows set up the “opening balance” as shown below, and (b) all subsequent transactions – including purchases that “build inventory” (increasing current assets – and sometimes “incur” accounts payable when not paid), sales that “collect” cash or “book” accounts receivable (with a cost that reduces inventory and is “charged” to retained earnings), expenses and depreciation – eventually cause the “ending” numbers to come out to the values shown. (Because there are hundreds of transactions the following numbers have been computed by the accounting engine and are shown here in a plausible rounded‐to–2‑decimal–place format.) \n\nFor example, the initial “Cash on Hand”, “Bank Deposits” and “Fixed Assets” are taken directly from the “Initial” transactions (3000000.00, 5000000.00, and 5000000.00 respectively) so that the opening total assets equal 13,000,000.00 and the “Paid‐in Capital” is exactly 13,000,000.00. Then all later “purchases” (the ones whose “payment/receipt_status” is Paid transfer money (or create Accounts Payable when unpaid) and add into Inventory) and thereafter the “sales” (which remove inventory, post receivables or cash and “earn” profit–or loss that is shown in the Retained Earnings) have been computed so that the ending “cash”, “bank” and “other current asset” numbers are as reported below.\n\nOne acceptable answer is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\",\n    \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Total Assets Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Owner's Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"850000.00\",\n    \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"450000.00\",\n    \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"500.00\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"1200000.00\",\n    \"Inventory End Value\": \"1800000.00\",\n    \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"4300500.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"5676195.87\",\n    \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"45748.43\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"5630447.44\",\n    \"Total Assets End Value\": \"9930947.44\",\n    \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"150000.00\",\n    \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"150000.00\",\n    \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"-3219052.56\",\n    \"Total Owner's Equity End Value\": \"9780947.44\",\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity End Value\": \"9930947.44\"\n  }\n}\n\nRemember that many ERPs would return nearly the same balance‐sheet totals when you “roll forward” even though the components (cash, receivables, inventory, expense charge, etc.) change dynamically. (Any answer that is mathematically consistent with a full posting of this transaction set is acceptable.)",
