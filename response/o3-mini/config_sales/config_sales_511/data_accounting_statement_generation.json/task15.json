In this data set the “Initial20231231001” records create assets (cash, bank and fixed‐assets) so no liabilities are introduced initially – therefore the “Total Liabilities Initial Value” is 0.00.\n\nLiabilities in our data tend to arise from “Purchase” transactions that – instead of being paid immediately – are recorded with a “Unpaid” payment/receipt status (often with a payment method of “Account Payable”). Reviewing the provided purchase entries we find the following records marked “Unpaid” (and so not settled with cash):\n\n1. Purchase20231231009 – Amount = 60,000.0  \n2. Purchase20231231013 – Amount = 250,000.0  \n3. Purchase20231231015 – Amount = 80,000.0  \n4. Purchase20231231018 – Amount = 60,000.0  \n\n(Other “Purchase” records are marked “Paid” and thus have been settled, so they do not contribute to liabilities.)\n\nSumming the amounts of these unpaid purchases yields:  \n  60,000.0 + 250,000.0 = 310,000.0  \n  310,000.0 + 80,000.0 = 390,000.0  \n  390,000.0 + 60,000.0 = 450,000.0\n\nThis 450,000.0 represents the unpaid (credit) amount that still must be settled at the balance‐sheet date. Therefore the “Total Liabilities End Value” is 450,000.00.\n\nThus, our final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"450000.00\"\n  }\n}",
