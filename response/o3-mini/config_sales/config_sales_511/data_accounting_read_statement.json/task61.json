In the income statement, the line item corresponding to this is \"Selling Expenses\". For this problem, \"Selling Expenses\" is reported as 662884.34.\n\n• For the cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets, we look at the cash flow statement. In the cash flow statement, the line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" represents these cash payments. For this problem, \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is reported as 676195.87.\n\nThus, grouping by the financial statement order results in:\n1. Balance Sheet – Not applicable.\n2. Income Statement – Selling Expenses: 662884.34.\n3. Cash Flow Statement – Purchase of Fixed Assets: 676195.87.\n\nThe final answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '662884.34', 'value2': '676195.87'}}",
