                        "content": "We start by extracting the relevant amounts from the end‐date numbers in the balance sheet and cash flow statement.\n\n1. Current Assets and Current Liabilities:\n • Cash on Hand = 4,303,451.63  \n • Bank Deposits = 2,938,804.13  \n • Interest Receivable = 8,592.81  \n • Accounts Receivable = 1,502,354.84  \n • Inventory = 440,000.00  \n • Total Current Assets (given) = 9,193,203.41  \n • Total Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 450,000.00 + 278,279.50 = 728,279.50\n\n2. Calculate the ratios:\n\nA. Current Ratio  \n = Total Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \n = 9,193,203.41 / 728,279.50  \n ≈ 12.62\n\nB. Quick Ratio  \n = (Current Assets – Inventory) / Current Liabilities  \n Here, the “quick” assets are:  \n  Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable  \n  = 4,303,451.63 + 2,938,804.13 + 8,592.81 + 1,502,354.84  \n  = 8,753,203.41  \n Then,  \n  Quick Ratio = 8,753,203.41 / 728,279.50 ≈ 12.02\n\nC. Debt to Asset Ratio  \n Total Debt is taken as Total Liabilities (here only current liabilities are provided).  \n = 728,279.50 / Total Assets  \n Total Assets = 14,823,650.85  \n Thus,  \n  Debt to Asset Ratio = 728,279.50 / 14,823,650.85 ≈ 0.0492, or about 0.05\n\nD. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n = Total Debt / Owner’s Equity  \n Owner’s Equity = 14,095,371.35  \n Thus,  \n  Debt to Equity Ratio = 728,279.50 / 14,095,371.35 ≈ 0.0517, or about 0.05\n\nE. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \n Using the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities from the cash flow statement: –81,548.37  \n = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt  \n = –81,548.37 / 728,279.50  \n ≈ –0.112, or about –0.11\n\nNow we present the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"12.62\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"12.02\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.05\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.05\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.11\"\n  }\n}",
