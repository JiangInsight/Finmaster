Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities, taken from the Cash Flow Statement, is –81,548.37.\n2. Total Debt is taken as the sum of current liabilities. In the balance sheet these are:\n  • Accounts Payable: 450,000.00  \n  • Taxes Payable: 278,279.50  \n  Total Current Liabilities = 728,279.50\n\nThe Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is calculated as: \n\n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n  –81,548.37 / 728,279.50 ≈ –0.112\n\nRounded to two decimal places, this is approximately –0.11.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.11\"}}",
