                        "content": "We first determine the two ratios from the balance sheet and cash flow statement.\n\n1. Debt to Asset Ratio  \n • Debt is the total liabilities. In the balance sheet the liabilities equal Total Assets minus Total Owner’s Equity.  \n  Total Assets = 14,823,650.85  \n  Total Owner’s Equity = 14,095,371.35  \n  Debt = 14,823,650.85 – 14,095,371.35 = 728,279.50  \n • Therefore, the Debt to Asset Ratio is:  \n  728,279.50 / 14,823,650.85 ≈ 0.0492, which rounds to 0.05.\n\n2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio  \n • From the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is –81,548.37 and from the income statement the Net Profit is 1,095,371.35.  \n • The ratio is computed as:  \n  (–81,548.37) / 1,095,371.35 ≈ –0.0745, which rounds to –0.07.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.05\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-0.07\"\n  }\n}",
