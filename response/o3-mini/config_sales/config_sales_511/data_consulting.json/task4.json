Here, Total Liabilities are represented by \"Total Current Liabilities\" and Total Owner's Equity is given by \"Total Owner's Equity\".\n\nStep 2: From the provided balance sheet as of 2024-01-27, we have:\n • Total Current Liabilities = 728279.50\n • Total Owner's Equity = 14095371.35\n\nStep 3: The Debt to Equity Ratio is calculated as:\n  Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n\nStep 4: Substitute the values:\n  Debt to Equity Ratio = 728279.50 / 14095371.35 ≈ 0.05166\n\nStep 5: Rounding the ratio to two decimal places gives approximately 0.05.\n\nThus, the final solution is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.05\"}}",
