                        "content": "Step 1. Calculate Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n• Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating CF / Total Current Liabilities  \nOperating CF = –81,548.37  \nTotal Current Liabilities = 728,279.50  \nRatio = –81,548.37 / 728,279.50 ≈ –0.112 → –0.11\n\nStep 2. Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \n• Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating CF / Total Debt  \nTotal Debt is taken as total liabilities. Here it is 728,279.50  \nRatio = –81,548.37 / 728,279.50 ≈ –0.112 → –0.11\n\nStep 3. Calculate Inventory Turnover Ratio  \n• Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  \nCost of Goods Sold = 3,020,000.00  \nInventory: Since initial inventory is 0 and end inventory is 440,000.00,  \nAverage Inventory = (0 + 440,000.00) / 2 = 220,000.00  \nRatio = 3,020,000.00 / 220,000.00 ≈ 13.73\n\nStep 4. Calculate Debt to Equity Ratio  \n• Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Owner's Equity  \nTotal Debt = 728,279.50  \nTotal Owner’s Equity (end) = 14,095,371.35  \nRatio = 728,279.50 / 14,095,371.35 ≈ 0.0517 → 0.05\n\nStep 5. Calculate Quick Ratio  \n• Quick Ratio = (Current Assets – Inventory) / Current Liabilities  \nCurrent Assets = 9,193,203.41  \nLess Inventory = 440,000.00  \nQuick Assets = 9,193,203.41 – 440,000.00 = 8,753,203.41  \nQuick Ratio = 8,753,203.41 / 728,279.50 ≈ 12.02\n\nStep 6. Calculate Current Ratio  \n• Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \nCurrent Ratio = 9,193,203.41 / 728,279.50 ≈ 12.62\n\nThus, our final solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.11\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.11\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"13.73\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.05\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"12.02\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"12.62\"\n  }\n}",
