                        "content": "We first need to extract the relevant values from the three statements. Below is the step‐by‐step process:\n\n1. Debt to Equity Ratio \n • From the balance sheet, the only liabilities shown are the “Total Current Liabilities”: 728279.50.\n • The Total Owner’s Equity is 14095371.35.\n • Therefore, the Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Owner’s Equity = 728279.50 / 14095371.35 ≈ 0.0517.\n • Rounding to two decimal places gives approximately 0.05.\n\n2. Net Profit Margin \n • From the income statement, the Net Profit is 1095371.35 and the Total Revenue is 5565589.48.\n • Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100 = (1095371.35 / 5565589.48) × 100 ≈ 19.68%.\n  \n3. Return on Assets (ROA) \n • The ROA is calculated using Net Profit and Total Assets. From the balance sheet, the ending Total Assets are 14823650.85.\n • ROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) × 100 = (1095371.35 / 14823650.85) × 100 ≈ 7.39%.\n\n4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio \n • From the balance sheet, the beginning Accounts Receivable was 0.00 (on 2023-12-31) and the ending Accounts Receivable is 1502354.84 (on 2024-01-27). \n • The average Accounts Receivable = (0.00 + 1502354.84) / 2 = 751177.42.\n • From the income statement, the Main Business Revenue = 5565589.48.\n • Thus, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable ≈ 5565589.48 / 751177.42 ≈ 7.41.\n\nNow we present the result in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.05\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"19.68%\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"7.39%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"7.41\"\n  }\n}",
