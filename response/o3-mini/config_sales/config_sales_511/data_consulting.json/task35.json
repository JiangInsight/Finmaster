                        "content": "We start by extracting the key numbers from the reporting dates (all “End_amount” values):\n\n1. Total Current Assets = 9,193,203.41  \n   Total Current Liabilities = 728,279.50\n\n2. From the income statement:  \n   Gross Profit = 2,545,589.48  \n   Total Revenue = 5,565,589.48  \n   Net Profit = 1,095,371.35\n\n3. From the balance sheet:  \n   Total Assets = 14,823,650.85  \n   (No additional non‐current liabilities are provided so we assume Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities.)\n\n4. Cash & Cash Equivalents ending balance from the cash flow (which is the sum of “Cash on Hand” and “Bank Deposits”) = 7,242,255.76\n\n5. From the cash flow statement:  \n   Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –81,548.37  \n   Purchase of Fixed Assets (Capital Expenditure) = 676,195.87  \n   (Free Cash Flow (FCF) is calculated as Operating Cash Flow minus CapEx.)\n\nNow we calculate each metric step by step:\n\nA. Current Ratio  \n  = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \n  = 9,193,203.41 / 728,279.50  \n  ≈ 12.62\n\nB. Gross Profit Margin  \n  = (Gross Profit / Revenue) × 100%  \n  = (2,545,589.48 / 5,565,589.48) × 100%  \n  ≈ 45.78%\n\nC. Debt to Asset Ratio  \n  = Total Liabilities / Total Assets  \n  = 728,279.50 / 14,823,650.85  \n  ≈ 0.05\n\nD. Net Profit Margin  \n  = (Net Profit / Revenue) × 100%  \n  = (1,095,371.35 / 5,565,589.48) × 100%  \n  ≈ 19.69%\n\nE. Cash to Current Debt Ratio  \n  = Cash and Cash Equivalents / Total Current Liabilities  \n  = 7,242,255.76 / 728,279.50  \n  ≈ 9.95\n\nF. Free Cash Flow (FCF)  \n  = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities – Capital Expenditures  \n  = (–81,548.37) – 676,195.87  \n  ≈ –757,744.24\n\nG. Return on Assets (ROA)  \n  = (Net Profit / Total Assets) × 100%  \n  = (1,095,371.35 / 14,823,650.85) × 100%  \n  ≈ 7.39%\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"12.62\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"45.78%\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.05\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"19.69%\",\n    \"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"9.95\",\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-757744.24\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"7.39%\"\n  }\n}",
