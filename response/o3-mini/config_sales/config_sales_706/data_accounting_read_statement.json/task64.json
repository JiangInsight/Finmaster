Its End_amount is 13000000.00.\n\n• Profit (or loss) for a period before deducting tax expense. This is given by the \"Profit Before Tax\" line item on the Income Statement. Its Amount is 1393861.65.\n\n• The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services purchased on credit. This is the \"Accounts Payable\" in the Balance Sheet. Its End_amount is 1820000.00.\n\nAccording to the instructions the final output is to be arranged (by financial statement group) in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow. In our answer we map the three values (capital contributed, profit before tax and accounts payable) as value1, value2 and value3 matching the sample solution format. (The sample solution labels value1 as Paid-in Capital, value2 as Profit Before Tax and value3 as Accounts Payable.)\n\nThus the solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value1\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"value2\": \"1393861.65\",\n    \"value3\": \"1820000.00\"\n  }\n}",
