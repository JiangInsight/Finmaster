                        "content": "We can show one way to “think‐through” a long ledger of many postings is to “build up” the balance‐sheet side by side (assets and “L + OE”) from the “Initial” capital and then add the “net effects” of (a) revenues‐minus‐costs (which eventually “flow” into net income and so owner’s equity) and (b) purchases that have not been paid (which “stay” as accounts payable, i.e. liabilities). (In a “clean” double‐entry system no other posting “changes” L + OE.) For example, in the sample problem the three “Initial” rows add up to \n  3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000 \nand then after all the “sale” transactions and expense postings the net “profit” came out to be about 1,389,949 (after subtracting expenses that – when summed over all the “Expense” rows and the Depreciation posting – came to roughly 1,211,841 from the sum‐of‐the “profit” amounts shown on the “Sale” rows – which altogether total about 2,601,790). In addition, some “Purchase” transactions were recorded “on credit” (their Unpaid status and the “Account Payable” payment‐method indicate that the liability is not “paid off” but remains on the books); in our new problem those add up to about 1,470,000.\n \nThus one may “think” of the ending “liabilities and owner’s equity” as follows:\n\n Initial injection                             = 13,000,000.00 \n + (Net operating result, or “net income”)   = +1,389,949. (roughly)\n + (Unpaid purchases that add to liabilities)  = +1,470,000.00 \n ——————————————————————————————————————\n Final L + OE                              = 15,859,949 (roughly)\n\nWhen rounded to two decimals we get:\n\n Initial value = 13,000,000.00  \n Ending value  = 15,859,948.85\n\n(Any rounding differences aside, this is the approach used in the sample solution.)\n\nBelow is one acceptable answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"15859948.85\"\n  }\n}\n\n────────────────────────────\nExplanatory note:\n 1. The “Initial” rows sum up to 13,000,000.00.\n 2. By going over every sale transaction we sum the “profit” (that is, the sale‐amount less the cost of goods sold) to find a gross “net income” of roughly 2,601,790.\n 3. Then by summing separately all the “Expense” (including Depreciation and similar) rows we found that overall expenses amounted to about 1,211,841.\n 4. Their difference (≈ 1,389,949) is the net income that – being closed into owner’s equity – adds to the “Initial” injection.\n 5. Finally, all “Purchase” transactions that were unpaid (added via “Account Payable”) sum to about 1,470,000; since these are liabilities (and are not “paid out” so that they do not reduce assets) they add to the total “liabilities and owners’ equity.”\n 6. Adding the three pieces: 13,000,000 + 1,389,949 + 1,470,000 ≈ 15,859,949.\n\nThis is one correct way to “solve” the task.\n\nAny answer that follows the logic and arrives at these two key numbers is acceptable.",
