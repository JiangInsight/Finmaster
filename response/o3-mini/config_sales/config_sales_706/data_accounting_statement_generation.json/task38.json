                        "content": "We have to “build” the ending balance for accounts receivable by “adding up” the net effect of every “Sale” that is recorded using Account Receivable (i.e. not settled by cash). (In a cash‐flow statement an increase in accounts receivable represents a “use” of cash and so is shown as a negative number.) \n\nBelow is one way to “walk‐through” the process:\n\n1. Look through the list and focus on Sale transactions (type = “Sale”) whose “receive_method” is “Account Receviable” (or similar) – these represent sales made on credit that have not yet been collected. (Other sale lines that list “Cash” as the receive method are not included.) \n2. For each such sale, we “take” the net amount – typically indicated by the “after_tax_amount” column. (You might also see that the “amount” is the gross but then there is an associated tax – in these problems the “after_tax_amount” is used.)\n3. In our data the following “Sale” rows use Account Receivable:\n\n  • Sale20240103006: after_tax_amount = 17,083.89  \n  • Sale20240105014: after_tax_amount = 74,167.28  \n  • Sale20240110028: after_tax_amount = 168,151.86  \n  • Sale20240111033: after_tax_amount = 24,956.91  \n  • Sale20240112036: after_tax_amount = 33,987.70  \n  • Sale20240112037: after_tax_amount = 32,917.15  \n  • Sale20240114046: after_tax_amount = 8,909.74  \n  • Sale20240114048: after_tax_amount = 163,019.94  \n  • Sale20240115050: after_tax_amount = 8,221.92  \n  • Sale20240115053: after_tax_amount = 34,115.96  \n  • Sale20240116055: after_tax_amount = 69,750.33  \n  • Sale20240116056: after_tax_amount = 71,437.99  \n  • Sale20240119067: after_tax_amount = 8,703.25  \n  • Sale20240119070: after_tax_amount = 36,058.05  \n  • Sale20240120073: after_tax_amount = 72,799.39  \n  • Sale20240122080: after_tax_amount = 244,630.41  \n  • Sale20240123087: after_tax_amount = 16,223.03  \n  • Sale20240125094: after_tax_amount = 99,766.70  \n  • Sale20240126103: after_tax_amount = 9,372.16  \n  • Sale20240128108: after_tax_amount = 85,107.30  \n  • Sale20240128109: after_tax_amount = 8,309.22\n\n4. Now, add these amounts together:\n \n  17,083.89  \n + 74,167.28 = 91,251.17  \n +168,151.86 = 259,403.03  \n + 24,956.91 = 284,359.94  \n + 33,987.70 = 318,347.64  \n + 32,917.15 = 351,264.79  \n + 8,909.74  = 360,174.53  \n +163,019.94 = 523,194.47  \n + 8,221.92  = 531,416.39  \n +34,115.96  = 565,532.35  \n + 69,750.33 = 635,282.68  \n + 71,437.99 = 706,720.67  \n + 8,703.25  = 715,423.92  \n + 36,058.05 = 751,481.97  \n + 72,799.39 = 824,281.36  \n +244,630.41 =1,068,911.77  \n + 16,223.03 =1,085,134.80  \n + 99,766.70 =1,184,901.50  \n + 9,372.16  =1,194,273.66  \n + 85,107.30 =1,279,380.96  \n + 8,309.22  =1,287,690.18  \n\n5. The total “increase” in accounts receivable is 1,287,690.18. (Since these credit sales are not immediately collected, the firm’s accounts receivable balance increases; in a cash‐flow statement an increase in AR reduces cash, so the effect is shown as a negative amount.)\n\nThus, the final “(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable” for the cash flow statement is –1,287,690.18.\n\nThe answer in the requested JSON format is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-1287690.18\"}}\n\n(Note: The process above assumes that no collections were recorded during the period to “offset” these sales. In these problems the net credit sales – i.e. the sum of the “after_tax_amount” for sales with Account Receviable – is taken as the change in AR.)",
