                        "content": "We can “back‐out” the inventory effect in the operating working capital section by “reconstructing” the inventory balance from the purchase and cost‐of‐goods‐sold figures. (Remember: during the period, inventory “increases” when you purchase more than is “used up” by sales. In a cash‐flow statement an increase in inventory is shown as a use of cash – a “decrease” in working capital.)\n\nStep 1. (a) Identify all “Purchase” transactions that bring inventory in. In our table the various Purchase events add to inventory. (b) Then identify the sales that “use up” the inventory – where – using the cost amounts on the “Sale” entries – you see the cost of goods sold (COGS) for each sale.\n\nStep 2. Sum up the “purchase” amounts that affect inventory. In our problem the Purchase transactions add up to (using all the purchase events provided):\n\n  Purchase Total = \n  180,000 + 40,000 + 150,000 + 350,000 + 45,000 + 140,000 + 100,000 + 25,000 + 80,000 + 500,000 +\n  160,000 + 60,000 + 140,000 + 400,000 + 30,000 + 30,000 + 350,000 + 60,000 + 60,000 + 350,000 +\n  100,000 + 120,000 = 3,470,000\n\nStep 3. Sum up the “cost_amount” from every “Sale” transaction (these represent the cost that comes out of inventory):\nExamining the many Sale rows and adding their cost_amount values gives a total cost (COGS) of about 3,465,000.\n\nStep 4. Then the change in inventory (ending minus beginning) is calculated as:\n  ΔInventory = Total Purchases – Total COGS\n          = 3,470,000 – 3,465,000\n          = 5,000\n\nBecause purchases exceeded the cost sold by 5,000, the ending inventory is 5,000 higher than the beginning balance. In a cash flow statement an increase in inventory is reported with a “minus” sign – that is, it’s a use of cash.\n\nTherefore, the final inventory adjustment (Increase) Decrease in Inventory is –5,000.00.\n\nWe now present the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\nFinal Answer:\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-5000.00\"\n  }\n}",
