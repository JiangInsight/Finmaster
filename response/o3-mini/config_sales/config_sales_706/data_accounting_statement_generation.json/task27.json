(Other “Expense” transactions – such as Sales Expenses or Financial Expenses – are not part of Administrative Expenses.) Below is one way to approach the process:\n\nStep 1. Go through the provided transactions and select those with type exactly “Administrative Expenses.”\n\nStep 2. From each such row, take the recorded amount value and sum them. In our current file we have the following Administrative Expenses rows (showing the recorded_amount values):\n\n1. Expense20240102001 – Administrative Expenses: 13,598.33  \n2. Expense20240104001 – Administrative Expenses: 11,440.73  \n3. Expense20240106001 – Administrative Expenses: 17,441.50  \n4. Expense20240107001 – Administrative Expenses: 16,376.52  \n5. Expense20240108001 – Administrative Expenses: 11,170.75  \n6. Expense20240108001 – Administrative Expenses: 3,796.88  \n7. Expense20240111001 – Administrative Expenses: 11,888.13  \n8. Expense20240111001 – Administrative Expenses: 22,411.89  \n9. Expense20240114001 – Administrative Expenses: 29,829.23  \n10. Expense20240114001 – Administrative Expenses: 6,448.24  \n11. Expense20240116001 – Administrative Expenses: 16,740.11  \n12. Expense20240124001 – Administrative Expenses: 14,013.88  \n13. Expense20240127001 – Administrative Expenses: 15,913.30  \n14. Expense20240129001 – Administrative Expenses: 32,980.69  \n15. Expense20240129001 – Administrative Expenses: 46,025.02  \n16. Expense20240129001 – Administrative Expenses: 5,053.76  \n17. Expense20240129001 – Administrative Expenses: 32,605.92  \n18. Expense20240130001 – Administrative Expenses: 7,914.04  \n19. Expense20240130001 – Administrative Expenses: 32,705.96  \n20. Expense20240130001 – Administrative Expenses: 22,841.68  \n\nStep 3. Sum all of these values:\n\n• 13,598.33 + 11,440.73 = 25,039.06  \n• + 17,441.50 = 42,480.56  \n• + 16,376.52 = 58,857.08  \n• + 11,170.75 = 70,027.83  \n• + 3,796.88 = 73,824.71  \n• + 11,888.13 = 85,712.84  \n• + 22,411.89 = 108,124.73  \n• + 29,829.23 = 137,953.96  \n• + 6,448.24 = 144,402.20  \n• + 16,740.11 = 161,142.31  \n• + 14,013.88 = 175,156.19  \n• + 15,913.30 = 191,069.49  \n• + 32,980.69 = 224,050.18  \n• + 46,025.02 = 270,075.20  \n• + 5,053.76 = 275,128.96  \n• + 32,605.92 = 307,734.88  \n• + 7,914.04 = 315,648.92  \n• + 32,705.96 = 348,354.88  \n• + 22,841.68 = 371,196.56  \n\nThus the total Administrative Expenses is 371,196.56.\n\nNow we present the final answer in the required json format.\n\nFinal Answer:\n--------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Administrative Expenses\": \"371196.56\"}}",
