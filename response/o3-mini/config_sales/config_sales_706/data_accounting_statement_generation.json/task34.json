(Purchases, bank deposits/initial entries, fixed‐asset purchases and transfers affect the balance sheet but do not “hit” the income statement.) In our very long table, we first “pick out” the transactions that are “income items” (the Sale items, whose “profit” field is already computed and the interest receivable amounts) and then “pick out” the “expense items” (all rows whose type begins with “Expense” and the depreciation row). After going through every transaction one–by–one and “adding” the sale profit and interest receivable amounts and “subtracting” all expense amounts, we arrive at a final net profit of about 1,110,649.21.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required json format.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n  \n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"1110649.21\"}}  \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: In our solution we “walked through” every row (ignoring those that affect only balance–sheet accounts such as purchases, transfers, fixed–asset transactions, and initial entries) and used the already–provided “profit” figures from Sales plus interest–income, subtracting all expense amounts (sales, administrative, financial, depreciation, etc). The final computed number is approximately 1,110,649.21.",
