                        "content": "We can “build” the inventory balance by “tracking” the purchase‐and “sale” events (which for our purpose act like adding to, or reducing from, an inventory stock) for each inventory–related product. (Note that the “Initial” transactions in these records are only about bank/cash or even fixed assets but they don’t “load” a “stock‐inventory” quantity.) One common method is to “sum up” the cost of all purchase transactions of “inventory‐items” to get a total “purchases cost” then “subtract” the “cost of goods sold” coming from the sale events. (In many systems the sale record carries a “cost_amount” field that is assumed to have been “assigned” when the sale occurred.)\n\nIn our many–line trial we can “group” by product (here the products are identified by product_id “P001”, “P002”, “P003” and “P004”). For each product we make a (rough) tally as follows:\n\n───────────────────────────── \n• Product P001 (“Premium Product A”):\n – All purchase events (all at a unit cost of 5000) gave us 8 + 9 + 5 + 6 = 28 units, whose total cost is 28×5000 = 140000.\n – Sales of P001 (looking “through” the sale records that list product P001) amount to 23 units.\n  Thus remaining units = 28 – 23 = 5; and the “inventory value” for P001 is 5×5000 = 25000.\n───────────────────────────── \n• Product P002 (“Premium Product B”):\n – Purchases:\n  10 units + 8 units + 6 units + 3 units = 27 units; all purchased at 10000 each so cost = 27×10000 = 270000.\n – Sales of P002 add up to 19 units.\n  Remaining = 27 – 19 = 8 units → value = 8×10000 = 80000.\n───────────────────────────── \n• Product P003 (“Premium Product C”):\n – Purchases:\n  9 + 7 + 8 + 7 + 3 + 6 + 5 = 45 units, and since each unit was purchased at 20000 the cost is 45×20000 = 900000.\n – Sales of P003 total 20 units.\n  Remaining = 45 – 20 = 25 units; value = 25×20000 = 500000.\n───────────────────────────── \n• Product P004 (“Premium Product D”):\n – Purchases:\n  3 + 10 + 8 + 7 + 7 = 35 units at 50000 each → cost = 35×50000 = 1750000.\n – Sales of P004 (when we add up the sale records for P004 we find quantities 1+2+1+2+2+2+2+3+2+3+3+2+1+3+3+1+1+2 = 36 units) which would “see –1 unit.” In a standard inventory system you cannot sell more than you have on hand so one would assume that the “inventory” for P004 is driven down to zero.\n───────────────────────────── \n\nThus, assuming no beginning inventory (that is, the “Inventory initial value” is 0), then the ending inventory is simply the sum over remaining inventory for each product. In our case this is\n\n P001: 25000  \n P002: 80000  \n P003: 500000  \n P004: 0      (since sales “exhausted” the P004 stock)\n\nTotal ending inventory value = 25000 + 80000 + 500000 + 0 = 605000.\n\nIt is common when “sales exceed that product’s purchases” that the system forces a “zero –in-hand” (no negative inventory allowed).\n\nTherefore, our final answers are:\n\n Inventory Initial Value: 0.00  \n Inventory End Value: 605000.00\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Initial Value': '0.00', 'Inventory End Value': '605000.00'} }\n``` \n\nThis is our step‐by–step result based on tracking the purchase and sale quantities (and noting the over–sale for product P004 sets its closing stock to 0).",
