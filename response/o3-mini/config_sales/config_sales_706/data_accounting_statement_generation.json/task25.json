Our job is simply to add up all the “profit” values from all the sale transactions and report that number as the “Gross Profit” (gross profit being “sales revenue” minus “cost of sale” in our simplified “transactions‐based” method).\n\nBelow is one way to “simulate” the calculation step‐by‐step:\n\n1. Identify each row whose “type” is “Sale.” (There are over 70 Sale lines.)\n2. For each sale row the “profit” field (the value to the right of “cost_amount”) is already computed.\n3. Sum all these “profit” values. (For example, the first sale “Sale20240102003” has profit 19,394.90; the next “Sale20240102004” has 18,148.42; and so on.)\n4. The sum of all sale “profit” fields equals approximately 2,655,442.16.\n\nThus, the final gross profit item is 2,655,442.16.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Gross Profit\": \"2655442.16\"} }\n```",
