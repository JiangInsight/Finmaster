                        "content": "We start by “loading” the initial balance into the bank deposits account (from the Initial20231231001 row with type “Bank deposit”) and then “adjust” that balance by subtracting the amounts for any paid‐out transactions that used the bank transfer method (or in the case of a fixed‑asset purchase paid by bank transfer).\n\nStep 1. Initial Bank Deposit  \n• From the row with type “Bank deposit” the value is 5,000,000.00.\n\nStep 2. Find all outflows from bank deposits (i.e. transactions in which payment_method is “Bank Transfer” or a fixed‑asset purchase paid via bank transfer). In our list these are the following rows (only those paid “by bank transfer” are taken, because when the payment method is “Cash” the cash account is affected instead):\n\n1. Purchase20231231002 – Purchase of 40,000.00 (Bank Transfer)  \n2. Purchase20231231005 – Purchase of 45,000.00 (Bank Transfer)  \n3. Purchase20231231006 – Purchase of 140,000.00 (Bank Transfer)  \n4. Purchase20231231007 – Purchase of 100,000.00 (Bank Transfer)  \n5. Purchase20231231009 – Purchase of 80,000.00 (Bank Transfer)  \n6. Purchase20231231010 – Purchase of 500,000.00 (Bank Transfer)  \n7. Purchase20231231012 – Purchase of 60,000.00 (Bank Transfer)  \n8. FixedAsset20231231001 – Fixed Assets Purchase of 352,857.55 (Paid by Bank Transfer)  \n9. Purchase20231231022 – Purchase of 120,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n\nStep 3. Sum the outflow amounts  \n• 40,000.00 + 45,000.00 = 85,000.00  \n• 85,000.00 + 140,000.00 = 225,000.00  \n• 225,000.00 + 100,000.00 = 325,000.00  \n• 325,000.00 + 80,000.00 = 405,000.00  \n• 405,000.00 + 500,000.00 = 905,000.00  \n• 905,000.00 + 60,000.00 = 965,000.00  \n• 965,000.00 + 352,857.55 = 1,317,857.55  \n• 1,317,857.55 + 120,000.00 = 1,437,857.55\n\nStep 4. Compute the ending bank deposit balance  \nInitial (5,000,000.00) minus the total “bank‐transfer outflow” (1,437,857.55) equals\n\n  5,000,000.00 – 1,437,857.55 = 3,562,142.45\n\nThus, in our balance sheet the Bank Deposits item shows an initial amount of 5,000,000.00 and by the end (after paying the above purchases/assets via bank transfer) the bank deposits balance is 3,562,142.45.\n\nPresenting the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"3562142.45\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis is our computed result based on the provided transaction data.",
