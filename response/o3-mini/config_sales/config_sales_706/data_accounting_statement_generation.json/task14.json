                        "content": "We note that “current liabilities” in our simple chart are normally the “Accounts Payable” coming from supplier‐invoices that have not been paid. In our data set only “Purchase” transactions appear to create this payable balance (the “Initial” rows are only asset openings). So we “filter” the purchase entries from the “2023‐12‐31” batch and then pick only those with a payment/receipt_status of “Unpaid” (or with a payment_method that indicates “Account Payable”). (All other transactions – sales, expenses, depreciation, interest receivables, transfers, fixed‐asset purchases – are not “current liabilities”.)\n\nLooking at our table we have the following Purchase transactions with date 2023‐12‐31 that are “Unpaid”:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001 – amount 180,000.0  \n2. Purchase20231231003 – amount 150,000.0  \n3. Purchase20231231004 – amount 350,000.0  \n4. Purchase20231231013 – amount 140,000.0  \n5. Purchase20231231014 – amount 400,000.0  \n6. Purchase20231231016 – amount 30,000.0  \n7. Purchase20231231019 – amount 60,000.0  \n8. Purchase20231231020 – amount 350,000.0  \n9. Purchase20231231021 – amount 100,000.0  \n\nNo other “Purchase” from December 31 is “Unpaid” (those marked “Paid” are settled already).\n\nWhen we sum these up the final (end‐of‐period) AP becomes: \n\n  180,000 + 150,000 = 330,000  \n  330,000 + 350,000 = 680,000  \n  680,000 + 140,000 = 820,000  \n  820,000 + 400,000 = 1,220,000  \n  1,220,000 + 30,000 = 1,250,000  \n  1,250,000 + 60,000 = 1,310,000  \n  1,310,000 + 350,000 = 1,660,000  \n  1,660,000 + 100,000 = 1,760,000  \n\nSince no “Initial” transaction recorded any liability (the three “Initial” rows are cash, bank and fixed‐assets) the opening value for current liabilities is 0.00.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n      \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n      \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"1760000.00\"\n  }\n}",
