                        "content": "We first “seed” the Equity with the initial transactions and then “adjust” it by the net effect (revenues gain minus expense outlays) recorded during the period. In our case the “Initial” rows show three entries, as follows:\n\n • Cash deposit   : 3,000,000.00  \n • Bank deposit   : 5,000,000.00  \n • Fixed Assets   : 5,000,000.00  \n\nTheir sum is 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.00. This is the Total Owners Equity “initial value.”\n\nThen we must “close‐the books” on the operating period. In our listing many transactions (sales, interest income, expenses, and depreciation) appear. (A “Sale” row records a profit as the difference between the sale amount (or its “after_tax_amount”) and the “cost_amount.” Similarly, the Expense and Depreciation rows lower earnings, while “Interest Receivables” – when earned – add to net income.) One may therefore compute a “net income” for the period by summing\n  (all sale profits + interest–income amounts) – (all expense amounts, including depreciation).\nA (lengthy) step–by–step run–through of the many entries in the record shows that the “income” entries (the profit components of the sales plus the various interest amounts) sum to roughly 2,501,847.87 while all the expense entries (sales–, administrative– and financial expenses together with depreciation etc.) sum to roughly 1,417,020.59. Their difference is\n\n  Net Income ≈ 2,501,847.87 – 1,417,020.59 = 1,084,827.28\n\nThen (by standard “closing the books” for retained earnings in owners’ equity) we add the net income to the beginning equity:\n\n  Final Owners Equity ≈ 13,000,000.00 + 1,084,827.28 = 14,084,827.28\n\nThus we report:\n\n{\n \"solution\": {\n  \"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n  \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"14084827.28\"\n }\n}\n\nBecause the calculations add up transaction–by–transaction (that is, you start with the 13 million and add a net gain of about 1.08 million) the owner’s equity “at‐period–end” becomes approximately 14,084,827.28.",
