                        "content": "We can “imagine” that – after starting the business with three “initial” asset entries (cash, bank and fixed) totaling 13 000 000 – many operating transactions (some of which add to cash – “paid‐in” sales and kinds of “purchased” inventory that will appear on the balance sheet, plus the fact that a new fixed asset item was obtained – and others that (even if paid at the time) are “financed” via payables or recorded as receivables) have gradually pushed up the overall asset position. (For example, one may “reconstruct” the arithmetic by noting that in addition to the initial 13 000 000, the operations “generated” net cash of roughly 2 883 670, an “inventory” buildup of about 3 470 000, new account receivables of some 1 174 485 (plus small unpaid interest receivables of about 10 364) and a small increase in the fixed assets by about 352 858.) \n\nIf you add these increases together (2 883 670 + 352 858 + 3 470 000 + 1 174 485 + 10 364 ≈ 7 891 377) and add that to the initial total assets of 13 000 000, you end up with approximately 20 891 377 as the balance‐sheet “total assets” at the end of the period.\n\nThus, the answer is as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n     \"Total Assets Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n     \"Total Assets End Value\": \"20891377.00\"\n  }\n}\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote that this “back‐of‐the‐envelope” calculation is based on carefully “reading” (and summing) the cash effects, “inventory” additions coming from purchases – even if some were not paid in cash immediately – plus the new fixed asset and receivable items. This is one acceptable way to “solve” the problem given the list of transactions.",
