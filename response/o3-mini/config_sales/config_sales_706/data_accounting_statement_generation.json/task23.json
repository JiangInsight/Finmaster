(In these books the “Sale” rows include a “cost_amount” field which is interpreted as the cost of the inventory that has been sold.) In our input each Row with type “Sale” has a “cost_amount”. Therefore, the final COGS is obtained by summing up each sale’s “cost_amount.”\n\nLet’s go through (by “grouping” the sale rows in order) and add the cost_amount values. (Only rows with type “Sale” are used.)\n\nBelow is a brief “extraction” of the sale rows and their cost_amount values. (For example, the very first sale row shows “Sale20240102003” with cost_amount = 20000.0. The next sale (“Sale20240102004”) has cost_amount = 20000.0; then “Sale20240103006” has 10000.0; and so on.) \n\nHere is the list tally (each “Sale…” row is listed with its cost_amount):\n\n1.
