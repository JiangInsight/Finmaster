                        "content": "We must “build” the current taxes‐payable balance (i.e. the liability that the company still owes with respect to taxes on its sales) as follows. In many accounting systems one “starts” with no opening balance for taxes payable (often the opening “Initial” transactions do not include any tax amount – in our example the exposure begins at zero). Then for the period under review we “accumulate” the tax amounts on revenue transactions (here “Sale” entries that show a nonblank “tax_amount” value).\n\nLooking over the provided table it is only the “Sale” transactions that show a tax_amount value. (Other “Expense”, “Purchase”, “Interest” and “Initial” entries do not contribute to the tax‐liability.) By going “row‐by‐row” through the table we add up the tax_amounts from every Sale transaction. (For example, one “Sale” row shows a tax_amount of 1969.75, another 1907.42, then 899.15, 4517.04, 453.69, … etc.) When all such tax_amount values are added – carrying out the (often tedious) addition step by step—we obtain an ending balance for taxes payable of 288,372.63.\n\nThus, assuming no tax payment (or other adjusting entries) are recorded during the period and that no beginning balance existed, we have:\n\n• Taxes Payable (Initial Value) = 0.00  \n• Taxes Payable (End Value) = 288,372.63\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {\"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"288372.63\"} }\n------------------------------------------------\n\nExplanation summary:\n\n1. The “Initial” entries (cash/bank deposits etc.) do not include any tax amount.\n2. Only the Sale transactions include a “tax_amount” – these are summed up.\n3. When we list and add every tax_amount value from every Sale row (as done step‐by‐step above) the total equals 288,372.63.\n4. With no opening tax liability, the end “taxes payable” figure is the sum just computed.\n\nThis is the final answer.",
