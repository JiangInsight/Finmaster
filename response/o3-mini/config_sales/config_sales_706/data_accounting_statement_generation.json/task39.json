                        "content": "We need to “adjust” the profit‐based net income by removing non‐cash items. One such item is the “Interest Receivable” balance. In our work the “Interest Receivable” account is increased (accrued interest revenue that has not been received in cash) and—when preparing the cash flow statement—we must “deduct” any increase (or “add” a decrease) from net income.\n\nOne common procedure is to “roll‐up” all transactions that affect the Interest Receivable account. In our file the only rows that have type “Interest Receivables” are the following (all amounts are given as “amount”):\n\n • Interest20240101001  445.0  \n • Interest20240102002  441.44  \n • Interest20240103003  441.44  \n • Interest20240104004  437.435  \n • Interest20240105005  416.075  \n • Interest20240106006  416.075  \n • Interest20240107007  416.075  \n • Interest20240108008  416.075  \n • Interest20240109009  416.075  \n • Interest20240110010  416.075  \n • Interest20240111011  416.075  \n • Interest20240112012  371.575  \n • Interest20240113013  371.575  \n • Interest20240114014  371.575  \n • Interest20240115015  366.235     (approximately)  \n • Interest20240116016  366.235  \n • Interest20240117017  366.235  \n • Interest20240118018  366.235  \n • Interest20240119019  366.235  \n • Interest20240120020  366.235  \n • Interest20240121021  366.235  \n • Interest20240122022  366.235  \n • Interest20240123023  334.83067805  \n • Interest20240124024  334.83067805  \n • Interest20240125025  334.83067805  \n • Interest20240126026  334.83067805  \n • Interest20240127027  324.15067805  \n • Interest20240128028  324.15067805  \n • Interest20240129029  5.75345573  \n • Interest20240130030  14.65345573  \n\nWhen we add these up (step‑by‑step, grouping items if needed), we obtain a sum of about 10,730.48. (You may verify with a calculator.) In the “indirect method” for the cash flow statement the change in an asset account is “subtracted” from the profit‐based income when that account has increased during the period. Since the Interest Receivable asset has increased by 10,730.48, we must reduce net income by that amount. That is why the cash flow statement shows a “(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable” of –10,730.48.\n\nThus the solution, expressed in the required JSON format, is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-10730.48\"\n  }\n}\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the final adjustment to the cash flow statement from the transactions data provided.",
