Purchase20231231001  amount = 180,000.0  \n2. Purchase20231231003  amount = 150,000.0  \n3. Purchase20231231004  amount = 350,000.0  \n4. Purchase20231231013  amount = 140,000.0  \n5. Purchase20231231014  amount = 400,000.0  \n6. Purchase20231231015  amount = 30,000.0  \n7. Purchase20231231016  amount = 30,000.0  \n8. Purchase20231231018  amount = 60,000.0  \n9. Purchase20231231019  amount = 60,000.0  \n10. Purchase20231231020  amount = 350,000.0  \n11. Purchase20231231021  amount = 100,000.0  \n\n(Other “Purchase” transactions either used another payment method – such as Bank Transfer or Cash – or were “Paid” and thus not still “owed.”)\n\nNow add these in order:\n\n 180,000  \n+150,000 = 330,000  \n+350,000 = 680,000  \n+140,000 = 820,000  \n+400,000 = 1,220,000  \n+ 30,000 = 1,250,000  \n+ 30,000 = 1,280,000  \n+ 60,000 = 1,340,000  \n+ 60,000 = 1,400,000  \n+350,000 = 1,750,000  \n+100,000 = 1,850,000\n\nThus the ending “accounts payable” balance is 1,850,000.00.\nThere is no “initial” payable amount (the Initial entries were cash, bank and fixed assets).\n\nSo our answer is:\n\n{\n  \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"1850000.00\"\n}\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"1850000.00\"}}",
