In our transactions the only non‐current (fixed) asset starting balance is given by the Initial row with type “Fixed Assets” with an amount of 5,000,000.00.\n\nThen we must adjust that balance with additions and deductions. In our data we have only one transaction that clearly adds to the fixed asset balance – a “Fixed Assets Purchase” transaction (its id is “FixedAsset20231231001”) for an amount of 352,857.55. (Its “asset_type” is “Processing Equipment” so it is part of the non current assets.)\n\nWe also have one depreciation transaction – with type “Depreciation” (with id “Depreciation20240101001”) for an amount of 45,749.76 (the value in the row is 45749.759999999995, which we round to 45,749.76).\n\nThus the ending balance for non‐current assets is computed as:\n\n  Final = initial fixed assets + additions – depreciation  \n     = 5,000,000.00 + 352,857.55 – 45,749.76  \n     = 5,352,857.55 – 45,749.76  \n     = 5,307,107.79\n\nTherefore the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n  \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"5307107.79\"\n}",
