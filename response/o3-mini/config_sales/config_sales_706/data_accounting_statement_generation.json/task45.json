In our bank statement the only item in a category “Fixed Assets” (which is typically an investing activity) is the third row of the table. That row shows the purchase (or investment) in fixed assets for an amount of 5,000,000.0. All the other transactions (purchases of raw materials/products/expenses, sales, transfers, etc.) are part of operating or financing activities. (Also noncash items such as depreciation do not affect the cash flow.) \n\nThus the net cash flow from investing activities is simply the cash paid for fixed assets – a cash outflow of –5000000.0.\n\nBelow is our answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-5000000.0\"}}",
