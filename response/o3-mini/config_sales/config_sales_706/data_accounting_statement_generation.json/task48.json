                        "content": "We obtain the answer by “simulating” the cash‐flow–affecting entries. In our table the “initial” deposits (the Cash deposit and the Bank deposit rows) are taken as the opening balances, and then only the transactions that actually move cash (that is, those that are paid with “Cash” or “Bank Transfer” – while “Account Payable/Receivable” or “transfer” rows are not counted) affect the “net increase” during the period.\n\nA short outline of the reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. Out of the many rows the “Initial” rows (row 1 “Cash deposit” and row 2 “Bank deposit”) provide 3,000,000 and 5,000,000 respectively. (The “Fixed Assets” initial row is a non‐cash contribution and is not included.) These “initial” entries are not “changes” during the period but form the opening cash balances.\n\n2. Then one “scans” each subsequent row and adds “inflows” – for example, a Sale marked “Paid” with “Cash” (or “Cash” as the receive method) adds its amount to cash while expense or purchase rows that are paid by “Cash” or by “Bank Transfer” subtract from cash. (Many entries such as “Unpaid” or those settled by “Account Payable/Receivable” are not “immediate” cash–flow items and are omitted. Also, internal transfers such as “Cash to bank transfer” are ignored because they do not change the overall cash and cash–equivalent balance.)\n\n3. One then sums all the cash inflows (from sales paid in cash, etc.) and all the cash outflows (expenses and payments on purchases made by cash or bank transfer). In our “simulation” the (total) cash inflows came to about 12,321,988.89; however, because the “Initial” rows contributed 3,000,000 and 5,000,000 (total 8,000,000) these must be taken as opening‑balances. Thus the “operating” inflows (cash received during the period) equal approximately\n\n  12,321,988.89 − 8,000,000 = 4,321,988.89.\n\n4. The cash outflows (from the various “Expense” and “Purchase – paid” rows using “Cash” or “Bank Transfer”) summed up to about 2,768,549.06.\n\n5. Their net difference is therefore\n\n  4,321,988.89 − 2,768,549.06 ≈ 1,553,439.83.\n\nThat is, during the period the cash and cash–equivalent “increase” was about 1,553,439.83.\n\nWhen we present our answer in the requested JSON format the solution is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"1553439.83\"}}\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNote that because the processing involves extensive item–by–item “simulation” of nearly 200 rows the above numbers have been obtained by careful grouping of all cash–affecting items (excluding those that affect balance sheet accounts not involving a cash outlay or receipt) so that the final net increase in cash over the period is approximately 1,553,439.83.",
