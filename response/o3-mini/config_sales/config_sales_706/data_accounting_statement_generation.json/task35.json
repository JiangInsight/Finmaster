                        "content": "We must “build” an income statement from the many transaction‐lines. (For details please see the step–by–step explanation below.) In our “sales” lines we assume that the “after_tax_amount” is the revenue actually earned for our core operations and that each sale also “brings” along its “cost_amount” (which we add up to compute the cost of goods sold). All “Expense” items classified as “Sales Expenses” are treated as selling (operating) expenses while those labelled “Administrative Expenses” are “admin” expenses. The “Financial Expenses” appear separately; meanwhile the “Depreciation” line is recorded as a noncash expense. Finally, the “Interest receivables” (all positive amounts) are treated as “interest income”. (Any cash–in from “Initial”, “Fixed Assets” or “Purchase” items are balance–sheet items and are not used in the income statement.) \n\nStep–by–step we (approximately) computed:\n\n1. For every “Sale…” transaction we summing:\n\n  • Total (main business) revenue = sum of “after_tax_amount” = \n   37425.15 + 36241.00 + 17083.89 + 85823.67 + 8620.16 + 25234.18 + 25069.08 + 74167.28 + 36515.09 + 34359.69 + 164506.98 + 93289.19 + 17764.33 + 18897.65 + 168151.86 + 165855.94 + 24956.91 + 186263.97 + 16326.03 + 33987.70 + 32917.15 + 107522.83 + 86290.39 + 34592.88 + 54013.63 + 8909.74 + 111542.36 + 163019.94 + 8221.92 + 279572.86 + 18895.58 + 34115.96 + 69750.33 + 71437.99 + 16828.83 + 112906.51 + 17682.05 + 34426.86 + 167465.01 + 70712.34 + 35777.70 + 8703.25 + 28296.57 + 32886.28 + 36058.05 + 72799.39 + 34336.15 + 248415.83 + 244630.41 + 168890.01 + 83924.42 + 37154.29 + 33791.36 + 16223.03 + 100345.39 + 164680.33 + 72712.01 + 252995.27 + 99766.70 + 35075.73 + 8216.33 + 82206.71 + 18371.74 + 272541.11 + 9372.16 + 280878.70 + 93426.41 + 85107.30 + 8309.22 + 36759.23 + 48733.63 + 33964.76 + 220302.45 + 121865.14 + 70585.24 \n   ≈ 5,969,467.21\n\n  • Cost of goods sold is the sum of each sale’s “cost_amount” \n   ≈ 3,565,000.00\n\nThus the gross profit comes to  \n  Gross Profit = 5,969,467.21 – 3,565,000.00 = 2,404,467.21\n\n2. Next we add all operating expenses from the “Expense…” records (only those of “Sales Expenses”, “Administrative Expenses” and “Financial Expenses”) plus depreciation. Our (approximate) running sums came out to be:\n  • Administrative Expenses ≈ 173,628.00 \n  • Selling (Sales) Expenses ≈ 747,810.34 \n  • Financial Expenses ≈ 287,278.52 \n  • Depreciation     ≈ 45,749.76\n\nTotal operating expense is then the sum of these four groups:\n  Total Expenses = 173,628.00 + 747,810.34 + 287,278.52 + 45,749.76 \n              ≈ 1,254,466.61\n\n3. Next, interest income is taken as the sum of all “Interest Receivables” items which adds up to about\n  Interest Income ≈ 10,314.39\n\n4. Then,\n  Profit Before Tax = Gross Profit – Operating Expenses + Interest Income \n             ≈ 2,404,467.21 – 1,254,466.61 + 10,314.39 \n             ≈ 1,160,314.99\n\n5. Finally, assuming a tax rate of roughly 20% we compute:\n  Tax Expense ≈ 20% × 1,160,314.99 = 232,063.00  \n  Net Profit = Profit Before Tax – Tax Expense \n         ≈ 1,160,314.99 – 232,063.00 \n         ≈ 928,251.99\n\nWhen we then “place” these computed numbers into the prescribed JSON format (rounding to two–decimals) we obtain:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Main Business Revenue\": \"5969467.21\",\n    \"Total Revenue\": \"5969467.21\",\n    \"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"3565000.00\",\n    \"Total Cost\": \"3565000.00\",\n    \"Gross Profit\": \"2404467.21\",\n    \"Administrative Expenses\": \"173627.99\",\n    \"Selling Expenses\": \"747810.34\",\n    \"Depreciation\": \"45749.76\",\n    \"Financial Expenses\": \"287278.52\",\n    \"Total Expenses\": \"1254466.61\",\n    \"Interest Income\": \"10314.39\",\n    \"Profit Before Tax\": \"1160314.99\",\n    \"Tax Expense\": \"232063.00\",\n    \"Net Profit\": \"928251.99\"\n  }\n}\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nThe above result is our complete income statement as derived step‐by–step from the provided transactions data.",
