                        "content": "We have to “build” the accounts‐payable balance by checking only those purchase transactions that are recorded as “Unpaid” and that use “Account Payable” as the payment method. (Any transactions where the purchase is paid by other methods like Cash, Bank Transfer, etc., are not recorded as AP.) In our file the beginning balance is assumed to be zero (because the “Initial” rows do not include any payable amount). So we “add” every purchase that is posted as Unpaid and that uses “Account Payable.”\n\nStep‐by‐step we scan the “Purchase” rows:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001 is a Purchase for 180,000.0 with an “Unpaid” status and payment method “Account Payable.” → +180,000  \n2. Purchase20231231003 is a Purchase for 150,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable) → +150,000  \n3. Purchase20231231004 is a Purchase for 350,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable) → +350,000  \n4. Purchase20231231013 is a Purchase for 140,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable) → +140,000  \n5. Purchase20231231014 is a Purchase for 400,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable) → +400,000  \n6. Purchase20231231016 is a Purchase for 30,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable) → +30,000  \n7. Purchase20231231018 is a Purchase for 60,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable) → +60,000  \n8. Purchase20231231019 is a Purchase for 60,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable) → +60,000  \n9. Purchase20231231020 is a Purchase for 350,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable) → +350,000  \n10. Purchase20231231021 is a Purchase for 100,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable) → +100,000  \n\nNow, adding these amounts:\n\n  180,000 + 150,000 = 330,000  \n  330,000 + 350,000 = 680,000  \n  680,000 + 140,000 = 820,000  \n  820,000 + 400,000 = 1,220,000  \n  1,220,000 + 30,000 = 1,250,000  \n  1,250,000 + 60,000 = 1,310,000  \n  1,310,000 + 60,000 = 1,370,000  \n  1,370,000 + 350,000 = 1,720,000  \n  1,720,000 + 100,000 = 1,820,000  \n\nNo “AP payments” (that is, purchases marked Paid with “Account Payable”) are found to reduce this balance so the net increase (i.e. the ending AP balance) is 1,820,000.00.\n\nThus our final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"1820000.00\"} }\n```",
