                        "content": "We start by identifying the entries that affect the fixed‐assets account. In our “Problem to Solve” the key entries are:\n\n1. The opening (initial) fixed asset record:\n  • Row with id “Initial20231231001” and type “Fixed Assets” shows an amount of 5,000,000.00.\n  This is the starting book value of fixed assets.\n\n2. Any fixed asset “additions” (non‐depreciation purchases) are recorded with a “Fixed Assets Purchase” type. In our data we have one such row:\n  • Row with id “FixedAsset20231231001” with type “Fixed Assets Purchase” and amount = 352,857.55.\n  This represents an additional fixed asset acquisition.\n\n3. Depreciation decreases the net book value. In our data there is one depreciation row:\n  • Row “Depreciation20240101001” with type “Depreciation” and amount = 45,749.76 (the printed amount is 45,749.759999999995, rounded here to 45,749.76).\n\nSo the net fixed asset at the reporting (end) date is calculated as follows:\n\n  Initial fixed assets = 5,000,000.00  \n  + Fixed asset additions = 352,857.55  \n  = 5,352,857.55 (the “gross” fixed assets at end)  \n  Then subtract Depreciation = 45,749.76\n\nThus,\n  Net fixed asset value at end = 5,352,857.55 – 45,749.76 = 5,307,107.79\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"fixed assets net Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"fixed assets net End Value\": \"5307107.79\"\n  }\n}",
