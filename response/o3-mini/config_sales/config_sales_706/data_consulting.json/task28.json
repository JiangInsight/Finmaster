Debt to Asset Ratio  \n   This ratio is defined as the total liabilities divided by the total assets. In the balance sheet, the only liabilities shown are current liabilities.  \n   • Total Liabilities (Current Liabilities – End Amount) = 2,110,671.05  \n   • Total Assets (End Amount) = 16,213,861.65  \n   Calculation:  \n     Debt to Asset Ratio = 2,110,671.05 / 16,213,861.65 ≈ 0.1302  \n   Rounded, this becomes approximately 0.13.\n\n2. Gross Profit Margin  \n   This ratio is defined as gross profit divided by total revenue, expressed in percentage.  \n   • Gross Profit = 2,638,420.67  \n   • Total Revenue = 5,813,420.67  \n   Calculation:  \n     Gross Profit Margin = (2,638,420.67 / 5,813,420.67) × 100 ≈ 45.36%\n\n3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n   This ratio is calculated as the net cash flow from operating activities divided by the total current liabilities.  \n   • Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 1,598,438.00  \n   • Total Current Liabilities = 2,110,671.05  \n   Calculation:  \n     Operating Cash Flow Ratio = 1,598,438.00 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 0.757  \n   Rounded, this is approximately 0.76.\n\nThe final answer in the required format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.13\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"45.36%\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"0.76\"\n  }\n}",
