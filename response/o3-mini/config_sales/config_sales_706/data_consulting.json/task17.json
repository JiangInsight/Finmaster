Identify Operating Cash Flow and Debt from the statements.\n\n• Operating Cash Flow: From the cash flow statement, the \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" is given as 1,598,438.00.\n\n• Debt: In this task and using the example as a guide, we use the \"Total Current Liabilities\" from the balance sheet to represent our debt, which is 2,110,671.05.\n\nStep 2. Compute the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio by dividing Operating Cash Flow by Total Current Liabilities.\n\n  Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities  \n    = 1,598,438.00 / 2,110,671.05  \n    ≈ 0.757, which rounds to 0.76.\n\nStep 3. Prepare the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"0.76\"}\n}",
