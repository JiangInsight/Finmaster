                        "content": "We begin by extracting the required numbers from the provided statements.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\n • Definition: Operating CF / Current Liabilities.\n • From the cash flow statement, Net CF from Operating Activities = 1,598,438.00.\n • From the balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities = 2,110,671.05.\n • Therefore: 1,598,438.00 ÷ 2,110,671.05 ≈ 0.757 and we round to 0.76.\n\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:\n • Definition (using available data): Operating CF / Debt. Here, total debt is considered as the current liabilities.\n • Using the same numbers above: 1,598,438.00 ÷ 2,110,671.05 ≈ 0.757 which rounds to 0.76.\n\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio:\n • Definition: Cost of Goods Sold ÷ Average Inventory.\n • COGS from the income statement = 3,175,000.00.\n • Inventory at beginning is 0 and at end is 295,000.00 so Average Inventory = (0 + 295,000.00) / 2 = 147,500.00.\n • Therefore: 3,175,000.00 ÷ 147,500.00 ≈ 21.53.\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio:\n • Definition: Total Liabilities ÷ Total Owner’s Equity.\n • Total Liabilities (only current liabilities provided) = 2,110,671.05.\n • Total Owner’s Equity from the balance sheet = 14,103,190.60.\n • Thus: 2,110,671.05 ÷ 14,103,190.60 ≈ 0.1497, or 0.15 when rounded.\n\n5. Quick Ratio:\n • Definition: (Total Current Assets – Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities.\n • Total Current Assets = 10,906,753.86.\n • Inventory = 295,000.00.\n • So, Quick Assets = 10,906,753.86 – 295,000.00 = 10,611,753.86.\n • Then: 10,611,753.86 ÷ 2,110,671.05 ≈ 5.028, which rounds to 5.03.\n\n6. Current Ratio:\n • Definition: Total Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities.\n • Thus: 10,906,753.86 ÷ 2,110,671.05 ≈ 5.17.\n\nBelow is the JSON answer with the results:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"0.76\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"0.76\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"21.53\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.15\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"5.03\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"5.17\"\n  }\n}",
