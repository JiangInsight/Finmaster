                        "content": "We start by computing the following ratios step‐by‐step. All numbers are taken from the “end” period amounts, and where needed we use averages between beginning and end.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n • Operating Cash Flow = 1,598,438.00  \n • Total Current Liabilities = 2,110,671.05  \n  Ratio = 1,598,438.00 ÷ 2,110,671.05 ≈ 0.76\n\n2. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n • Total Liabilities = Total Assets – Total Owner’s Equity = 16,213,861.65 – 14,103,190.60 = 2,110,671.05  \n • Total Owner’s Equity (end) = 14,103,190.60  \n  Ratio = 2,110,671.05 ÷ 14,103,190.60 ≈ 0.15\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n • Total Revenue = 5,813,420.67  \n • Average Total Assets = (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) ÷ 2  \n  = (13,000,000.00 + 16,213,861.65) ÷ 2 ≈ 14,606,930.83  \n  Ratio = 5,813,420.67 ÷ 14,606,930.83 ≈ 0.40\n\n4. Quick Ratio  \n • Quick Assets = Total Current Assets – Inventory  \n  = 10,906,753.86 – 295,000.00 = 10,611,753.86  \n • Total Current Liabilities = 2,110,671.05  \n  Ratio = 10,611,753.86 ÷ 2,110,671.05 ≈ 5.03\n\n5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n • This is defined the same as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.  \n  Thus, Ratio ≈ 0.76\n\n6. Return on Equity (ROE)  \n • Net Profit = 1,103,190.60  \n • Average Owner’s Equity = (Beginning Owner’s Equity + Ending Owner’s Equity) ÷ 2  \n  = (13,000,000.00 + 14,103,190.60) ÷ 2 ≈ 13,551,595.30  \n  ROE = 1,103,190.60 ÷ 13,551,595.30 ≈ 0.0814 or 8.14%\n\n7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n • Total Revenue = 5,813,420.67  \n • Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) ÷ 2  \n  = (0 + 1,355,463.34) ÷ 2 = 677,731.67  \n  Ratio = 5,813,420.67 ÷ 677,731.67 ≈ 8.57\n\nThe final answers (rounded as shown) are provided in the JSON below.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"0.76\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.15\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.40\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"5.03\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"0.76\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"8.14%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"8.57\"\n  }\n}",
