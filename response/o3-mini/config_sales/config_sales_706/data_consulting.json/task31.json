                        "content": "We start by extracting the important numbers from the three statements. Note that many ratios are calculated using the end‐of‐period values, and for averages we use the beginning (if available) and ending values.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n• Definition: This ratio shows how many times revenue \"turns over\" the Accounts Receivable during the period.\n• Formula: Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nFrom the provided income statement:\n  Total Revenue = 5,813,420.67\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n  Beginning Accounts Receivable (2023-12-31) = 0.00  \n  Ending Accounts Receivable (2024-01-28) = 1,355,463.34\n\nCompute the average:\n  Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 1,355,463.34) / 2 = 677,731.67\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n  Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 5,813,420.67 / 677,731.67 ≈ 8.57\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThe example provided treated these two as the same measure. Normally, both are defined as:\n  Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 1,598,438.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n  Ending Total Current Liabilities (2024-01-28) = 2,110,671.05\n\nNow, the ratio:\n  Ratio = 1,598,438.00 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 0.757 (which rounds to about 0.76)\n\nThus, both \"operating cash flow ratio\" and \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\" are about 0.76.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n• Definition: This ratio measures how effectively the company uses its assets to generate revenue.\n• Formula: Total Asset Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n  Ending Total Assets (2024-01-28) = 16,213,861.65\n\nNow, calculate:\n  Total Asset Turnover Ratio = 5,813,420.67 / 16,213,861.65 ≈ 0.3587, or about 0.36\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n• Definition: This ratio shows the proportion of liabilities to shareholders’ equity.\n• Formula: Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n  Total Liabilities: The only liabilities provided are the current liabilities.\n  Ending Total Current Liabilities = 2,110,671.05  \n  Ending Total Owner's Equity = 14,103,190.60\n\nNow, calculate:\n  Debt to Equity Ratio = 2,110,671.05 / 14,103,190.60 ≈ 0.1497, or about 0.15\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThus, our computed ratios are:\n\n• Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: 8.57  \n• Operating Cash Flow Ratio: 0.76  \n• Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: 0.76  \n• Total Asset Turnover Ratio: 0.36  \n• Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.15\n\n──────────────────────────────\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"8.57\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"0.76\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"0.76\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.36\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.15\"\n  }\n}",
