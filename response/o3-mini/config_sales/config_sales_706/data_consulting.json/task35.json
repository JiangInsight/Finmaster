                        "content": "We start by extracting the relevant end‐of‐period numbers:\n\n1. Current Assets = 10,906,753.86  \n   Current Liabilities = 2,110,671.05  \n\n2. From the income statement:  \n   Total Revenue = 5,813,420.67  \n   Gross Profit = 2,638,420.67  \n   Net Profit = 1,103,190.60  \n\n3. From the balance sheet:  \n   Total Assets = 16,213,861.65  \n   Owner's Equity = 14,103,190.60 (which implies Total Liabilities = Total Assets – Equity = 2,110,671.05)\n\n4. From the cash flow statement, we have:  \n   Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 1,598,438.00  \n   Purchase of Fixed Assets = 352,857.55  \n   The final Cash and Cash Equivalents (or cash) = 9,245,580.45  \n\nNow, we calculate step by step:\n\nA. Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \n   = 10,906,753.86 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 5.17\n\nB. Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%  \n   = (2,638,420.67 / 5,813,420.67) × 100% ≈ 45.36%\n\nC. Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets  \n   = 2,110,671.05 / 16,213,861.65 ≈ 0.13\n\nD. Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%  \n   = (1,103,190.60 / 5,813,420.67) × 100% ≈ 18.97%\n\nE. Cash to Current Debt Ratio = Cash and Cash Equivalents / Total Current Liabilities  \n   = 9,245,580.45 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 4.38\n\nF. Free Cash Flow (FCF) = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities – Capital Expenditures  \n   = 1,598,438.00 – 352,857.55 = 1,245,580.45\n\nG. Return on Assets (ROA) = (Net Profit / Total Assets) × 100%  \n   = (1,103,190.60 / 16,213,861.65) × 100% ≈ 6.80%\n\nThus, our final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"5.17\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"45.36%\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.13\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"18.97%\",\n    \"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"4.38\",\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"1245580.45\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"6.80%\"\n  }\n}",
