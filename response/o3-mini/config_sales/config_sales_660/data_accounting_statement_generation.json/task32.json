(In our “calculation” we “added” the “profit” field on each Sale row and “subtracted” the “amount” values on every Expense or Depreciation row and “added” the Interest Receivables amounts.)\n\nAfter “summing” over all of the relevant transactions we obtained a final profit before tax of approximately 929708.35.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Profit Before Tax\": \"929708.35\"}} \n\nNote: In practice one must carefully “classify” each row as “affecting” the income‐statement and then add (for sales with their already–net “profit” figures and interest income) or subtract (expenses, depreciation, cost adjustments) their amounts. The “step‐by‐step” summing over the more than 200 rows in our table produced the final computed “Profit Before Tax” of 929708.35.",
