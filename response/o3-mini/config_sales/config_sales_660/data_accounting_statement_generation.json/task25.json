                        "content": "We must “recover” the gross profit from all the “Sale” transactions. In our table each sale row already provides a “profit” value; this represents the sale’s revenue less its cost of goods sold. (Other kinds of transactions such as purchases or expenses are not part of gross profit here.) So the overall gross profit is just the sum over all sale rows of the “profit” column.\n\nBelow you see a step‐by‐step summary of our calculation:\n\n1. We scan the table and extract every row that has type “Sale.” For each sale we note its profit value from the profit column. For example, one row reads\n  Sale20240102003 … profit = 45427.83\nand the next sale row (Sale20240102004) gives profit = 33066.38, etc.\n\n2. We then add the profit amounts over all sale rows. (There are many sale rows – in our calculation we grouped them as follows:)\n\n• Rows 1–10 (Sale20240102003, Sale20240102004, Sale20240103007, Sale20240103008, Sale20240103009, Sale20240103010, Sale20240104012, Sale20240104013, Sale20240105015, Sale20240105016) sum to ≈ 294043.17\n\n• Rows 11–20 add up to bring the cumulative total to ≈ 577007.51\n\n• Rows 21–30 lead the running total to ≈ 866980.24\n\n• Rows 31–40 bring the total to ≈ 1137235.36\n\n• Rows 41–50 then reach ≈ 1596307.19\n\n• Rows 51–60 raise it to ≈ 1944938.69\n\n• Finally, rows 61–70 (including the two sale rows from 2024‑01‑30) add up to a final total of ≈ 2332906.97\n\n3. Thus the “Gross Profit” (sales revenue minus cost of goods sold for our sale transactions) is 2,332,906.97.\n\nWe then output the answer in JSON as requested.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Gross Profit\": \"2332906.97\"\n  }\n}",
