                        "content": "We first “seed” the books with three entries (a cash deposit, a bank deposit and a fixed‐asset entry) that together “inaugurate” the owners’ equity at 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.00.\n\nThen – following the “logic” used in the sample – we “net‐up” the operating results over the month. In our bookkeeping table the many “Sale” rows carry a “profit” value (that is, for each sale the profit is calculated after deducting the sales cost) while the operating “Expense” rows (which include sales expenses, administrative and financial expenses, plus the “Depreciation” entry) have been recorded separately. Also, interest–related revenue (recorded as “Interest Receivables”) is posted as an additional “plus‐income.” (Purchases and fixed–asset acquisitions are “balance sheet” exchanges and do not directly change net income.) \n\nA step–by–step “sketch” of the calculation is as follows:\n\n1. The “initial owners’ equity” is clearly \n  3000000.00 + 5000000.00 + 5000000.00 = 13,000,000.00\n\n2. Next the “net operating result” is (in our system) the sum over all sale transactions (each posting a “profit” value) plus the sum of all “Interest Receivables” amounts – then subtracting the sum of all “Expense” items (which include our sales, administrative, financial expenses and depreciation). (Purchases are recorded at the asset or liability side and do not affect the profit‐or–loss.)\n\nIn our new problem the profits posted on the sale entries (when added up over nearly seventy “Sale…” lines) come to about 2,314,660; the “Interest Receivables” rows sum to roughly 7,930; while the summation of every “Expense …”, “Depreciation …” (and similar) row – taken in date order – comes to about 1,318,006. In other words, the net operating income (profit) is approximately\n\n  2,314,660 + 7,930 − 1,318,006 ≈ 1,004,584\n\n3. Finally, the “final owners’ equity” is computed as\n\n  Initial equity + net income = 13,000,000.00 + 1,004,584 ≈ 14,004,584.00\n\nThus, the answer we present (rounding amounts to two decimals) is as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"14004584.00\"\n  }\n}\n\n(Notes on the computation: Because every transaction is “posted” in both the operating (profit) side and the balance sheet – and our bookkeeper has provided a “profit” field for each sale – the net income is taken as the sum over sale–profits plus interest revenues (which are “inflows”) minus all operating expense totals. Then that net result is added to the beginning owners’ equity to yield the final “book” equity.)",
