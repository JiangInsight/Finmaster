We first identified all “Sale” transactions and summed their “after_tax_amount” values to get the main (and total) revenue. In our detailed (approximate) calculation the total came to about 4,810,692.24.\n2. The cost of goods sold was computed by summing up the “cost_amount” on each sale. Then Gross Profit was given by subtracting COGS from revenue.\n3. Administrative and Selling expenses were estimated by adding up the “Expense” rows tagged “Administrative Expenses” and “Sales Expenses” respectively.\n4. Depreciation was taken directly from its single transaction.\n5. Financial Expenses were summed from the “Financial Expenses” items.\n6. The Total Expenses is the sum of all expense categories.\n7. The “Interest Income” was calculated by summing the amounts from the many “Interest Receivables” entries.\n8. Profit Before Tax was calculated as Gross Profit – Total Expenses + Interest Income.\n9. A tax charge (using an approximate effective rate) was applied to get the Net Profit.\n\nThe numbers shown above are our best–estimate based on the transactions provided.\n",
