                        "content": "We must “build” the AR balance from all transactions that resulted in sales on credit (that is, the ones in which the “receive_method” is “Account Receviable” – note the spelling in the data). No “Initial” posting has any accounts receivable so the beginning (as‐of 2023‑12‑31) AR balance is zero. Then, by “adding” the credit sales amounts (ignoring—in our “trial‐balance” view—the other transactions like cash sales, purchases, expense items, etc.) the ending AR balance is the sum of the recorded amounts (each sale’s recorded_amount) that were booked with “Account Receviable” as the receive method.\n\nA brief “walk‐through” of the dataset (only “Sale” rows with “Account Receviable” are considered):\n\n• Sale20240103010: 38,997.09 \n• Sale20240104012: 70,456.48 \n• Sale20240106019: 55,318.92 \n• Sale20240106020: 51,853.62 \n• Sale20240107021: 54,295.02 \n• Sale20240107023: 38,307.23 \n• Sale20240109031: 9,336.67 \n• Sale20240110034: 59,913.93 \n• Sale20240110036: 105,182.97 \n• Sale20240111037: 88,373.95 \n• Sale20240112038: 178,436.76 \n• Sale20240113044: 19,697.24 \n• Sale20240113045: 36,195.87 \n• Sale20240115051: 25,833.39 \n• Sale20240116057: 34,349.19 \n• Sale20240120074: 17,898.02 \n• Sale20240120075: 34,296.24 \n• Sale20240121077: 36,421.21 \n• Sale20240121079: 25,618.35 \n• Sale20240122083: 199,540.68 \n• Sale20240123088: 19,898.44 \n• Sale20240123089: 76,210.50 \n• Sale20240124093: 17,172.26 \n• Sale20240124094: 29,887.86 \n• Sale20240125097: 268,595.22 \n• Sale20240126099: 19,781.02 \n• Sale20240127108: 59,395.56 \n• Sale20240128110: 199,844.62\n\n(sum these step‐by‐step the running total is 1,870,108.31)\n\nThus, the beginning “Accounts Receivable” balance is 0.00 and at the end it totals about 1,870,108.31.\n\nThe answer may be presented in the requested JSON format as follows:\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"1870108.31\"}}\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: In our “step‐by‐step” we ignored all cash received sales (receive_method \"Cash\") and only summed up amounts when the credit sale was recorded using “Account Receviable”. This is why the AR beginning balance remains zero and only the credit sales add up to the ending AR amount.",
