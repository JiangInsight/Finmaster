In our data the only investing transactions are the ones whose “type” is “Fixed Assets Purchase.” In our very long table these occur as follows (all amounts are reported as cash disbursements so they are “outflows,” i.e. negative in the cash–flow statement):\n\n• One Fixed Assets Purchase entry with an amount of 73,907.19  \n• One Fixed Assets Purchase entry with an amount of 171,448.09  \n• One Fixed Assets Purchase entry with an amount of 92,277.65  \n• One Fixed Assets Purchase entry with an amount of 191,303.24\n\nWe sum these amounts:\n\n  73,907.19 + 171,448.09 = 245,355.28  \n  245,355.28 + 92,277.65 = 337,632.93  \n  337,632.93 + 191,303.24 = 528,936.17\n\nSince these are cash outflows (money used to purchase fixed assets), the net cash flow from investing activities is –528,936.17.\n\nThus, in the required format our answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-528936.17\"}}",
