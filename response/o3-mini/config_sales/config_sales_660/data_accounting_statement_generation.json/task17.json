                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” the overall net income that will be “retained” (assuming no dividend payout) by (a) adding the “profit” that each sale transaction contributes and the “interest receivable” income (even if not collected, they are usually accrued into net income) and then (b) subtracting the “expense” transactions (which include types “Expense” as well as “Depreciation” – whose “amount” here is an expense even though it is reported separately).\n\nFor example, in our sample there are many “Sale…” rows whose “profit” field was computed in each row (by the formula after_tax_amount – cost_amount + tax_amount) and many “Expense…” rows (which already record an outlay that will reduce net income). Also note that the “Depreciation” row is an expense that reduces earnings. (Other kinds of “Purchase” entries are not “expensed” immediately so they do not hit the income statement.)\n\nBy going through the full set of transactions (see “Reasoning” below) one finds that the sum of all the “Sale”–generated profit comes to approximately 2,307,879.11; the “Interest receivable” transactions – which occur on many dates – add about 8,448.35 more. Over the same period, the “Expense” rows (all “Expense” lines of any subtype) add up to about 1,277,155.78 and the single “Depreciation” entry is 45,749.47. (All amounts are given in the same currency unit.) Then the net income is calculated as follows:\n\n  Net income =\n   [Sales profit + Interest Income] – [Expense total + Depreciation]\n   ≈ (2,307,879.11 + 8,448.35) – (1,277,155.78 + 45,749.47)\n   ≈ 2,316,327.46 – 1,322,905.25\n   ≈ 993,422.21\n\nBecause no beginning retained‐earnings balance is given (and it is customary to assume that the initial retained earnings is zero), the final “Retained Earnings” is simply the net income earned over the period.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"993422.21\"\n  }\n}\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep‐by‐step summary (conceptual outline):\n\n1. Identify which “transactions” affect the income statement:\n – “Sale…” rows (whose already–computed “profit” fields are added).\n – “Interest Receivables” rows (which are income even if “Unpaid”).\n – “Expense…” rows (of all kinds: Sales, Administrative, Financial, etc.).\n – “Depreciation…” row.\n (Purchases or fixed asset “Initial” entries are balance‐sheet items and not included in the current–period profit.)\n\n2. Sum up the profit numbers from all “Sale” rows (≈2,307,879.11).\n\n3. Sum up the “Interest Receivables” amounts across all such rows (≈8,448.35).\n\n4. Sum up all “Expense” amounts (from every “Expense…” row; note that the figures are positive numbers that, when expensed, reduce income; total ≈1,277,155.78).\n\n5. Add the “Depreciation” expense (≈45,749.47).\n\n6. Compute net income = (sales profit + interest income) – (total expenses + depreciation) ≈ 993,422.21.\n\n7. Because the “Retained Earnings Initial Value” is assumed 0.00 (no beginning profit carried over) then the “Retained Earnings End Value” equals the net income.\n\nThe final JSON answer is given below.\n\nHope this helps!",
