                        "content": "We must first “filter” the transaction rows to include only those affecting the property, plant and equipment (i.e. non‐current assets). In our case the only rows that affect that “bucket” are:\n• The “Initial” entry that sets up the fixed assets (non‐current asset) balance.\n• Any “Fixed Assets Purchase” (that is, rows whose “type” begins with “FixedAsset” and which list an asset name and asset type) because these are additions.\n• And any “Depreciation” entries that reduce the “non-current assets” account.\n\nStep‐by‐step we do the following:\n\n1. From the “Initial” entries (the three “Initial20231231001” rows) only the row with type “Fixed Assets” is relevant. Its amount is 5,000,000.00. This is the beginning (book) balance for non‐current assets (property, plant and equipment).\n\n2. Then we add all non‐current asset “purchases”. In our data these appear as rows whose “type” is “Fixed Assets Purchase”. In our problem we find the following such lines (the “FixedAsset20231231001” rows):\n\n  a. A Fixed Assets Purchase with amount 73,907.19 (asset “Production Line4”)\n  b. A Fixed Assets Purchase with amount 171,448.09 (asset – the asset name shows as a facility – for example “Production Line7” or “Storage Facilities5”; the exact “name” isn’t needed here)\n  c. A Fixed Assets Purchase with amount 92,277.65 (asset “Production Line6”)\n  d. A Fixed Assets Purchase with amount 191,303.24 (another addition – again in the “Production Line7” group)\n\nLet’s sum these:\n  73,907.19 + 171,448.09 = 245,355.28  \n  245,355.28 + 92,277.65 = 337,632.93  \n  337,632.93 + 191,303.24 = 528,936.17\n\n3. Next we subtract the accumulated depreciation. There is one “Depreciation” row in the data:\n  • Depreciation20240101001 with amount 45,749.47\n\n4. So, the “end value” of non‐current assets is computed as:\n  Ending value = (Initial non‐current assets + non‐current asset additions) − Depreciation  \n  = (5,000,000.00 + 528,936.17) − 45,749.47  \n  = 5,528,936.17 − 45,749.47  \n  = 5,483,186.70\n\nThus the answer is that the Total Non-current Assets Initial Value is 5,000,000.00 and the Total Non-current Assets End Value is 5,483,186.70.\n\nNow we present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal answer:\n────────────────────────────\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"5483186.70\"}}",
