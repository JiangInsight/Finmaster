                        "content": "We need to “back‐solve” the increases (new unpaid obligations) during the period that represent current liabilities. In our system the “Purchase” transactions that are recorded as “Unpaid” (with a Payment Method usually “Account Payable”) become our “current liabilities” (because the company still owes that money). (All the “Initial” rows show starting balances; in this case none of them come “owed” so the liabilities start at zero.)\n\nThus, step‐by‐step we “scan” through the transactions for purchases whose “payment/receipt_status” is “Unpaid” and add up the “amount” values. (Other transaction types such as “Expense” which were “Paid” do not create a liability – and “Interest Receivables” are asset items.) In our list the following “Purchase” rows are “Unpaid” (with an “Account Payable” payment method) and contribute to current liabilities:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001 – amount = 140,000.00  \n2. Purchase20231231003 – amount = 40,000.00  \n3. Purchase20231231004 – amount = 50,000.00  \n4. Purchase20231231007 – amount = 100,000.00  \n5. Purchase20231231011 – amount = 200,000.00  \n6. Purchase20231231012 – amount = 60,000.00  \n7. Purchase20231231014 – amount = 60,000.00  \n8. Purchase20231231017 – amount = 70,000.00  \n9. Purchase20231231020 – amount = 300,000.00  \n10. Purchase20231231022 – amount = 160,000.00  \n11. Purchase20231231023 – amount = 45,000.00  \n12. Purchase20231231024 – amount = 15,000.00\n\nBecause none of the “Initial…” rows include any liability items, the starting (initial) current liabilities value is zero.\n\nNow, adding these (all amounts are in the same currency):\n\n• 140,000.00  \n+ 40,000.00 → 180,000.00  \n+ 50,000.00 → 230,000.00  \n+ 100,000.00 → 330,000.00  \n+ 200,000.00 → 530,000.00  \n+ 60,000.00 → 590,000.00  \n+ 60,000.00 → 650,000.00  \n+ 70,000.00 → 720,000.00  \n+ 300,000.00 → 1,020,000.00  \n+ 160,000.00 → 1,180,000.00  \n+ 45,000.00 → 1,225,000.00  \n+ 15,000.00 → 1,240,000.00\n\nThus the ending current liabilities balance is 1,240,000.00.\n\nFinally we have:\n\n• Total Current Liabilities Initial Value = 0.00  \n• Total Current Liabilities End Value = 1240000.00\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"1240000.00\"} }\n```",
