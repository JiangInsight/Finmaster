                        "content": "We “start” with the bank‐deposit posting from the initial entry (a “Bank deposit” record) and then “adjust” that balance by all later payments that are made using the bank (that is, those transactions whose “payment_method” is “Bank Transfer” or – for fixed assets – “Paid” by bank transfer). (Other transactions that use “Cash” or “Account Payable” do not alter the bank‐deposits account.) \n\nIn the dataset the very first entries include these three “Initial…” rows. Only the “Bank deposit” row is relevant here, with an amount\n\n  5000000.00\n\nThen (roughly speaking) we scan the table for every “Purchase” or “Fixed Assets Purchase” (or similar transaction) that is paid via “Bank Transfer.” For example, from the “Purchase” records we found (and “Paid” by Bank Transfer) the following amounts (all in our “recorded_amount” field):\n\n• 20000.00           (Purchase20231231002)\n• 300000.00           (Purchase20231231005)\n• 200000.00           (Purchase20231231006)\n• 450000.00           (Purchase20231231009)\n• 60000.00            (Purchase20231231010)\n• 90000.00            (Purchase20231231008)\n• 35000.00            (Purchase20231231015)\n• 400000.00           (Purchase20231231016)\n• 90000.00            (Purchase20231231019)\n• 50000.00            (Purchase20231231026)\n\nSumming these gives\n\n  20,000 + 300,000 + 200,000 + 450,000 + 60,000 + 90,000 + 35,000 + 400,000 + 90,000 + 50,000 = 1,695,000.00\n\nIn addition, several fixed asset “purchase” records – those with type “Fixed Assets Purchase” that are paid by bank transfer – further reduce the bank balance. In the data we found these four fixed‐asset transactions with “Bank Transfer” payments:\n \n• 73907.19  \n• 171448.09  \n• 92277.65  \n• 191303.24  \n\nTheir total is\n\n  73,907.19 + 171,448.09 = 245,355.28  \n  245,355.28 + 92,277.65 = 337,632.93  \n  337,632.93 + 191,303.24 = 528,936.17\n\nNow, the total “bank‐transfer outflow” equals the sum from purchase (1,695,000.00) plus that from fixed assets (528,936.17):\n\n  1,695,000.00 + 528,936.17 = 2,223,936.17\n\nSubtracting this total outflow from the initial bank deposit gives the “ending” bank‐deposits balance:\n\n  5000000.00 – 2223936.17 = 2776063.83\n\nThus, reading through all the transactions that would affect the bank account, we conclude that at balance‐sheet date the bank deposits “end” at 2,776,063.83.\n\nSo the answer in the required json format is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"2776063.83\"} }\n\n–––––––––––––\n\nNote: In a full working system one would “trace” each transaction by its payment_method and amount; here we have identified only those transactions paid by Bank Transfer (or via Bank Transfer in the fixed asset purchases) – as these are the items that in our example reduce the bank‐deposit balance while the other entries (paid with Cash, via Account Payable, etc.) do not immediately change the bank account.",
