In our “problem” table the rows that show a fixed assets purchase are those whose “type” is “Fixed Assets Purchase.” (Note that the “Initial” record with type “Fixed Assets” is not a purchase transaction but the opening balance.) In our data we find the following records:\n\n1. Row with id “FixedAsset20231231001” and type “Fixed Assets Purchase” with an amount of 73907.19  \n2. A second “FixedAsset20231231001” row with an amount of 171448.09  \n3. A third similar row with an amount of 92277.65  \n4. A fourth one with an amount of 191303.24\n\nNow we sum these amounts step by step:\n\n• 73907.19 + 171448.09 = 245355.28  \n• 245355.28 + 92277.65 = 337632.93  \n• 337632.93 + 191303.24 = 528936.17\n\nThus, the final purchase of fixed assets is 528936.17.\n\nThe answer in our required format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"528936.17\"\n  }\n}",
