                        "content": "We need to “build up” the liabilities from those transaction entries that “create a payable” (that is, those purchases (or similar transactions) that report a payment‐status of “Unpaid” and a payment method of “Account Payable”). (Other kinds of transactions – such as cash deposits, fixed assets, expenses that are paid, sales, etc.– do not add to liabilities. Also, Interest Receivables are an asset item even if “unpaid”.)\n\nStep‑by‑step, we check the transaction rows that have a “Purchase” type and note if their payment/receipt status is “Unpaid” (or they use “Account Payable” as payment method). (The “Initial” transactions here list our asset beginning “balances;” no liabilities are established in an “Initial” entry.) \n\nBelow we list the “Purchase” transactions that meet liability “criteria” and then sum their “amount” fields:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001 – Purchase amount = 140,000.0, Unpaid, payment method Account Payable → add 140,000.0  \n2. Purchase20231231002 – amount = 20,000.0, but Paid → ignore  \n3. Purchase20231231003 – amount = 40,000.0, Unpaid, payment method Account Payable → add 40,000.0  \n4. Purchase20231231004 – amount = 50,000.0, Unpaid, payment method Account Payable → add 50,000.0  \n5. Purchase20231231005 – 300,000.0 Paid → ignore  \n6. Purchase20231231006 – 200,000.0 Paid → ignore  \n7. Purchase20231231007 – 100,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable → add 100,000.0  \n8. Purchase20231231008 – 90,000.0 Paid → ignore  \n9. Purchase20231231009 – 450,000.0 Paid → ignore  \n10. Purchase20231231010 – 60,000.0 Paid → ignore  \n11. Purchase20231231011 – 200,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable → add 200,000.0  \n12. Purchase20231231012 – 60,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable → add 60,000.0  \n13. Purchase20231231013 – 35,000.0 Paid → ignore  \n14. Purchase20231231014 – 60,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable → add 60,000.0  \n15. Purchase20231231015 – 35,000.0 Paid → ignore  \n16. Purchase20231231016 – 400,000.0 Paid → ignore  \n17. Purchase20231231017 – 70,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable → add 70,000.0  \n18. Purchase20231231018 – 40,000.0 Paid → ignore  \n19. Purchase20231231019 – 90,000.0 Paid → ignore  \n20. Purchase20231231020 – 300,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable → add 300,000.0  \n21. Purchase20231231021 – 15,000.0 Paid → ignore  \n22. Purchase20231231022 – 160,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable → add 160,000.0  \n23. Purchase20231231023 – 45,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable → add 45,000.0  \n24. Purchase20231231024 – 15,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable → add 15,000.0  \n25. Purchase20231231025 – 160,000.0 Paid → ignore  \n26. Purchase20231231026 – 50,000.0 Paid → ignore  \n\nNow, summing the “Unpaid” (liability) amounts:\n  140,000 + 40,000 = 180,000  \n  180,000 + 50,000 = 230,000  \n  230,000 + 100,000 = 330,000  \n  330,000 + 200,000 = 530,000  \n  530,000 + 60,000 = 590,000  \n  590,000 + 60,000 = 650,000  \n  650,000 + 70,000 = 720,000  \n  720,000 + 300,000 = 1,020,000  \n  1,020,000 + 160,000 = 1,180,000  \n  1,180,000 + 45,000 = 1,225,000  \n  1,225,000 + 15,000 = 1,240,000  \n\nThus the final total liabilities are 1,240,000.00.\n\nSince the “Initial …” rows provided represent the opening asset balances (cash, bank, fixed asset), and no initial liability was given, we take:\n\n• Total Liabilities Initial Value = 0.00  \n• Total Liabilities End Value = 1,240,000.00\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"1240000.00\"\n  }\n}",
