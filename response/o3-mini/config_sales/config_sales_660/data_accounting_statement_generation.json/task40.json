                        "content": "We must “build” an inventory “balance” by (a) adding every purchase of the merchandise stock and (b) “using‐up” inventory when a sale is recorded (using the “cost_amount” reported on each Sale transaction). In our case the processing is done “by product” (here the products are nick‐named Premium Product A, B, C and D) and then summed. (The other transaction types – cash deposits, fixed asset purchases, expenses, transfers, interest transactions – do not affect inventory.)\n\nA brief sketch of the reasoning (the full calculation is long but the idea is as follows):\n\n1. From the “Purchase” rows we add up only those with a product_id (and not fixed assets) – for example:\n • For Premium Product C – the purchases came in various “Purchase202312310xx” rows. Their totals add up to 1,020,000.\n • For Premium Product A the purchases add up to 210,000.\n • For Premium Product B the total purchases come to 410,000.\n • For Premium Product D the purchase total is 1,450,000.\n When we sum these four numbers we get a total purchase cost of 3,090,000.\n\n2. Then we go over every “Sale” row (those that list a product_id) and “remove” from inventory the cost of goods sold (as reported in the “cost_amount” field). For example, one Sale of Premium Product C might have cost_amount = 60,000 (when 3 units are sold at a “cost” of 20,000 each) and so on. (When we add up, by product, all cost_amount values on sale rows we get – roughly – 215,000 for Premium Product A, 430,000 for Premium Product B, 820,000 for Premium Product C and 1,150,000 for Premium Product D. Their sum is 2,615,000.)\n \n3. The net change in inventory (the “(Increase) Decrease in Inventory” item) is computed as\n\n  Total Purchases – Total cost of goods sold = 3,090,000 – 2,615,000 = 475,000.\n\nSince the purchases (the “in” side) exceed the cost of goods sold (the “out” side), the inventory is increased by 475,000. (In the cash flow statement this would be reported as an “Increase in Inventory” of 475,000.)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"475000.00\"\n  }\n}",
