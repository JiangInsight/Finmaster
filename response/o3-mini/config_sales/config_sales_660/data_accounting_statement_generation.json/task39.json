                        "content": "We must “re‐derive” the ending balance of the “Interest receivable” account in our period. To do so we scan all transactions whose “type” equals “Interest Receivables” and add their amounts (assuming the opening balance was zero). (Note that an increase in a current asset is “subtracted” in the operating section; that is why the final number is negative.) Here is one way to work through the numbers step‐by‐step:\n\n1. On January 1 the “Interest20240101001” transaction shows an amount of 445.0.\n2. On January 2 the “Interest20240102002” row has 443.22 (≈443.21999999999997).\n3. On January 3 the “Interest20240103003” adds about 398.72.\n4. On January 4 the “Interest20240104004” contributes about 392.14.\n5. On January 5 the “Interest20240105005” is 384.13.\n6. On January 6 “Interest20240106006” is 344.08.\n7. On January 7 “Interest20240107007” is 323.48.\n8. Also on January 8 “Interest20240108008” is 323.48.\n9. On January 9 “Interest20240109009” is 323.48.\n10. Still on January 10 “Interest20240110010” is 323.48.\n11. Then four more consecutive “Interest” entries on January 11 – January 14 (one each on 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th) each of about 323.48. (4 × 323.48 ≈ 1293.93.)\n12. On January 15 “Interest20240115015” equals about 312.16.\n13. On January 16 “Interest20240116016” adds about 295.13.\n14. On January 17 “Interest20240117017” adds about 259.53.\n15. On January 18 “Interest20240118018” adds about 259.53.\n16. On January 19 “Interest20240119019” adds about 259.53.\n17. On January 20 “Interest20240120020” adds about 259.53.\n18. On January 21 “Interest20240121021” adds another 259.53.\n19. On January 22 “Interest20240122022” adds 259.53.\n20. On January 23 “Interest20240123023” adds 259.53.\n21. On January 24 “Interest20240124024” adds 259.53.\n22. On January 25 “Interest20240125025” adds 259.53.\n23. On January 26 “Interest20240126026” adds 259.53.\n24. On January 27 “Interest20240127027” adds 259.53.\n25. On January 28 “Interest20240128028” is slightly lower, about 255.08.\n26. On January 29 “Interest20240129029” is again about 255.08.\n27. Finally, on January 30 “Interest20240130030” is only about 14.65.\n\nA careful adding of these 30 interest‐entries gives a total of approximately 8982.09. (One may verify that the overall sum is roughly 8982.09.)\n\nSince the “Interest Receivables” balance increased by 8982.09 during the period (with an assumed opening balance of zero) this increase is reported as a use of cash – that is, it is “subtracted” from net income in the operating section. Following the common reporting style we then show an “(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable” of –8982.09.\n\nThus the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-8982.09\"\n  }\n}",
