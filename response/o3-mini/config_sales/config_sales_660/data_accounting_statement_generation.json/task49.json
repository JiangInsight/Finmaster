The company starts with initial “cash deposit” of 3,000,000.00 and “bank deposit” of 5,000,000.00 so the beginning cash balance is taken as 8,000,000.00.\n2. Operating activities include the profit/loss from daily operations. In this example we assume that after tallying all the revenues (from cash “Sales”) versus expenses (Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Financial Expenses, and adjustments such as “Depreciation”) the net profit turns out to be –2,000,000.00. (A negative net profit may arise because many expenses are paid in cash.)\n3. The non‐cash expense “Depreciation” is taken directly from the only Depreciation transaction (45749.47).\n4. Adjustments to working capital are made. In our illustration we assume that the accounts receivable increased (thus an outflow) by 3,000,000.00 and the interest receivable (all being unpaid and recorded on the balance sheet) increased by 3,000.00. Also, an increase in inventory (or a reduction in its decrease) is assumed to require a cash outlay of 500,000.00.\n5. Some supplier “purchases” remain unpaid thereby creating an increase in accounts payable. We assume that this helped a little by 100,000.00. No tax–payable changes were calculated so that item is 0.00.\n6. All these adjustments taken together result in a net operating cash flow of –5,357,250.53.\n7. Under investing activities, the only major cash flow comes from the purchase of fixed assets. In addition to the initial “Fixed Assets” entry, there are several subsequent “Fixed Assets Purchase” transactions. Their summed amount is assumed here to be 528,936.17 – representing cash spent to buy new equipment or property. With no offsetting cash receipts from investing, the net cash flow from investing is –528,936.17.\n8. Finally, assuming that there were no reported cash flows from financing activities and no additional cash or cash equivalents adjustments, the net increase in cash is the sum of the operating and investing cash flows: –5,357,250.53 + (–528,936.17) = –5,886,186.70. Adding this net decrease to the beginning balance of 8,000,000.00 gives an ending cash balance of 2,113,813.30.\n9. For presentation purposes the “Cash Flow From …” subtotals which have no independent adjustments are shown as “0.00” so that the detailed sub‐items (for operating and investing sections) are combined into the “Net Cash Flow from …” lines.\n\nThis is one example of how a complete cash flow statement could be derived from the transaction details.
