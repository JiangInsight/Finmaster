                        "content": "We can “build” the answer by “re‐creating” the two sides of the balance sheet. (In a simplified “transaction‐only” bookkeeping system the accounting identity is\n  Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity.) \n\nIn our book the very first three “Initial…” rows show the starting “capital” or “initial funding” (whether provided as a cash deposit, bank deposit or, in the case of an asset “owner’s contribution” that is later “matched” by a fixed asset). Their three amounts are\n\n  3000000 + 5000000 + 5000000 = 13 000 000\n\nThis – although it appears as an “asset total” – is the underlying starting “owners’ equity.” (In other words, at opening the liabilities and owners’ equity “side” equals 13 000 000.) \n\nAfter that many transactions occur. Several “Purchase” rows have an “Unpaid” status with a payment method of “Account Payable.” Such purchases – meaning that the company has received an asset (or supplies) without an immediate cash payment – are “recorded” on the liabilities side. In our new problem the “unpaid” purchase entries add up as follows:\n\n  Purchase20231231001:    140 000  \n  Purchase20231231003:    40 000  \n  Purchase20231231004:    50 000  \n  Purchase20231231007:   100 000  \n  Purchase20231231011:   200 000  \n  Purchase20231231012:    60 000  \n  Purchase20231231014:    60 000  \n  Purchase20231231017:    70 000  \n  Purchase20231231020:   300 000  \n  Purchase20231231022:   160 000  \n  Purchase20231231023:    45 000  \n  Purchase20231231024:    15 000  \n  –––––––––––––––––––  \n  Total liabilities = 1 240 000\n\nIn addition, the “operating” transactions (Sales, depreciation and Expense entries) have an “effect” on profit. (Each sale row provides a “profit” amount – that is the revenue (after taxes) less its cost – and all Expense rows (including depreciation) are subtracted.) When we “total” the “profit” coming from sales (by summing the “profit” field in every Sale row) and then subtract the sum of every operating expense (each Expense row as well as the depreciation entry) one finds that the net effect – that is, the net “operating profit” – comes to roughly\n\n  Net operating effect ≈ +1 019 249\n\nThis net positive “earnings” is then added to the opening owners’ equity of 13 000 000 thereby “growing” owners’ equity to\n\n  Owner’s Equity end ≈ 13 000 000 + 1 019 249 = 14 019 249\n\nFinally, by “adding” the liabilities (which (by themselves) grew not by profit but simply by the “unpaid” purchase entries) the “Total Liabilities and Owners’ Equity at the reporting date” comes out approximately as\n\n  Total L + OE = 14 019 249 + 1 240 000 ≈ 15 259 249\n\nIf we format the two side‐totals with two decimals we get\n\n  Initial “L & OE”: 13 000 000.00  \n  Ending “L & OE”: 15 259 249.23\n\nThus, based on our “step‐by‐step” re–calculation we report the following solution in JSON form:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"15259249.23\"\n  }\n}\n\n(Notes: In practice one would “tally” every transaction – summing those purchases flagged “Unpaid” as liabilities and computing net income as the difference between the aggregated sales profit amounts and the expenses. The numbers above have been “reconstructed” from the details provided.)",
