                        "content": "We need to “reconstruct” the change in the balance for trade receivables (plus any interest receivable) which show up when a sale is “Unpaid” (or collected via “Account Receviable”). In our table the only transactions that contribute to receivables are those sales (and the “Interest Receivables” items) whose “receive_method” is “Account Receviable” (or when the payment/receipt status is Unpaid) plus the “Interest receviable” rows.\n\nThe step‐by‐step procedure is as follows:\n\n1. For every Sale row in the table, if the “receive_method” is “Account Receviable” (that is, the sale is not collected immediately) then the “after_tax_amount” is recorded as an increase in receivables. (For example, if a sale records “after_tax_amount” 37,047.24 and is “Unpaid” with receive method Account Receviable the balance increases by that amount.)\n\n2. In our “Sale” rows (by a careful screening of the data) the following “after_tax_amount” amounts appear (only in transactions where money is to be collected later) – we get (in US dollars):\n\n  a. Sale20240103010: 37,047.24  \n  b. Sale20240104012: 66,933.66  \n  c. Sale20240106019: 52,552.97  \n  d. Sale20240106020: 49,260.94  \n  e. Sale20240107021: 51,580.27  \n  f. Sale20240107023: 36,391.87  \n  g. Sale20240109031: 8,869.84  \n  h. Sale20240110034: 56,918.23  \n  i. Sale20240110036: 99,923.82  \n  j. Sale20240111037: 83,955.25  \n  k. Sale20240112038: 169,514.92  \n  l. Sale20240113044: 18,712.38  \n  m. Sale20240113045: 34,386.08  \n  n. Sale20240115051: 24,541.72  \n  o. Sale20240116057: 32,631.73  \n  p. Sale20240120074: 17,003.12  \n  q. Sale20240120075: 32,581.43  \n  r. Sale20240121077: 34,600.15  \n  s. Sale20240121079: 24,337.43  \n  t. Sale20240122083: 189,563.65  \n  u. Sale20240123088: 18,903.52  \n  v. Sale20240123089: 72,399.97  \n  w. Sale20240124093: 16,313.65  \n  x. Sale20240124094: 28,393.47  \n  y. Sale20240125097: 255,165.46  \n  z. Sale20240128108: 56,425.78  \n  aa. Sale20240128110: 189,852.39\n\nWhen you sum these 27 numbers you obtain a total increase (from sales) of about 1,758,760.94.\n\n3. In addition, the “Interest Receivables” transactions (which are recorded as “Interest Receivables” with “Unpaid” status and the word “Interest receviable” in the related field) add further to the AR balance. In our table the interest amounts are:\n\n  – 445.00  \n  – 443.22  \n  – 398.72  \n  – 392.14  \n  – 384.13  \n  – 344.08  \n  – 323.48 (this value appears repeatedly; exactly one each for the following rows: 20240107007, 20240108008, 20240109009, 20240110010, 20240111011, 20240112012, 20240113013, 20240114014)  \n  – Then a series of slightly lower amounts: 312.16 (from 20240115015), 295.13 (20240116016)  \n  – Then a number of 259.53’s from 20240117017, 20240118018, 20240119019, 20240120020, 20240121021, 20240122022, 20240123023, 20240124024, 20240125025, 20240126026, 20240127027  \n  – At the end the final two interest items are 255.08 (20240128028 and 20240129029).\n\nSumming all your “Interest receivable” amounts gives approximately 8,707.91.\n\n4. Now add the “sales‐related increase” and the “interest receivable” increase:\n\n  1,758,760.94 + 8,707.91 ≈ 1,767,468.85\n\n5. Since there is no beginning balance in AR (we assume zero at the start) the net change in receivables is an increase of 1,767,468.85. When reporting this on the cash flow statement (under the indirect method for operating activities) an increase in receivables is shown as a use of cash – that is, a negative adjustment.\n\nThus the final “(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable” figure is –1,767,468.85.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is therefore:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-1767468.85\"} }",
