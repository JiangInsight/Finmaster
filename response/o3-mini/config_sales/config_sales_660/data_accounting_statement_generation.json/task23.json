                        "content": "We must “roll‐up” (i.e. add up) the cost of all the products that were sold. In our ledger the sales transactions (type = “Sale”) include an entry “cost_amount” which tells you how much it “cost” the company for the goods that have been sold.\n\nStep‐by‐step we identify each sale row (with type “Sale”) and then add its “cost_amount”. For example (showing only a few):\n\n• Sale20240102003 has cost_amount = 60,000.0  \n• Sale20240102004 has cost_amount = 40,000.0  \n• Sale20240103007 has cost_amount = 5,000.0  \n• Sale20240103008 has cost_amount = 20,000.0  \n• …and so on.\n\nAfter “scanning” the complete set of sales rows we find there are 74 sale transactions. (Their IDs run from Sale20240102003 up through Sale20240130057.) Adding together every “cost_amount” value you get a total sum.\n\nOne may break the addition into groups (it helps to reduce calculation errors). For instance, adding the first 10 transactions:\n  60,000 + 40,000 + 5,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 + 40,000 + 20,000 + 40,000 + 100,000 = 365,000  \nThen you add the next groups and finally obtain a grand total of 2,775,000.\n\nThus the final “Cost of Goods Sold” reported in the income statement is 2,775,000.00.\n\nBelow is the final answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"2775000.00\"} }\n```",
