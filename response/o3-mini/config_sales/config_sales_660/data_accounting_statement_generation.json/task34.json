                        "content": "After analyzing the whole “income‐side” of the business we “extracted” those entries that – by accounting convention – affect profit. In our simplified (accrual) calculation the “operating revenues” come from the many “Sale” records (each carrying its computed “profit” already– roughly revenue less cost of goods sold) plus the company’s “Interest Receivables.” Then all “Expense‐type” transactions (including sales, administrative and financial expenses) and the “Depreciation” hit the income statement as deductions. (Purchases, bank/cash in–out and Fixed Assets entries are balance sheet items and do not directly affect the current period’s P&L.)\n\nA “step‐by‐step” (approximate) summary of our method was as follows:\n\n1. We “picked” every sale transaction and added together their “profit” amounts. In our table these 72 sale records add to about 2,328,939.23.\n2. We gathered every “Interest Receivables” record – several small amounts on the order of a few hundred dollars each – whose total came to about 8,982.06.\n3. Their sum represents operating revenues (2,328,939.23 + 8,982.06 ≈ 2,337,921.29).\n4. Next we added all the ‘Expense’‐type transactions (those whose “type” is Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Financial Expenses, plus the Depreciation) whose “amount” totals about 1,291,942.12.\n5. Finally, net profit is simply the “income” less “expenses”: \n  2,337,921.29 – 1,291,942.12 = 1,045,979.17.\n\nWhen rounded to two decimals we obtain a net profit of 1,045,979.17.\n\nThus, the final “net profit” item reported in the income statement would be:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"1045979.17\"}\n} \n\nNote:\nThis “by‐hand” aggregation is based on treating the “profit” column on each sale as already a “gross profit” amount and subtracting from that the sum of all operating expenses (including depreciation and other expense lines).",
