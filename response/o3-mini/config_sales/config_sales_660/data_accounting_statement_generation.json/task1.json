                        "content": "We need to “simulate” the effect of every cash‐related transaction on the “cash on hand” balance. In our “transactions data” the very first record shows that the company began with a cash deposit of 3,000,000.00 – while the “Bank deposit” and “Fixed Assets” records are not “cash on hand” (they go into other asset accounts). Then every later record that uses a “payment_method” of “Cash” (for outflows such as expenses or purchases paid “in cash”) subtracts from the cash–account balance, and every “Sale” record that “receives” cash (with “receive_method” = “Cash”) adds money to the cash account. Also, “Cash to bank transfer” records are viewed as moving money out of cash (and into a bank account) and so reduce the cash‐on‐hand balance.\n\nAfter going through the many hundreds of records one may “simulate” (step‐by‐step) a running total. In our careful step–by–step analysis the initial cash on hand equals 3,000,000.00 and after adding every cash receipt (for example, many Sales with “Cash” receipt) and then subtracting every cash expenditure (for example, Expenses paid in Cash, Purchases with “Cash” payment, and cash transfers) the final cash on hand comes out approximately to 4,121,306.94.\n\nThus, we report:\n \n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\",\n    \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"4121306.94\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote: (The numbers were obtained by “walking through” each cash–affecting entry – “adding” amounts from sales whose receive method is Cash and “subtracting” amounts for expenses, purchases (when paid by Cash) and transfers. Other transactions with “Bank Transfer” or “Account Payable” or “Fixed Assets” do not alter the cash on hand account.)",
