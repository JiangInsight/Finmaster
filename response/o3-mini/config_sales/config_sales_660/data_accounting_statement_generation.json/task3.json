                        "content": "We must determine the “stock‐on‐hand” by “capitalizing” only those transactions that change the inventory balance (that is, purchase transactions add inventory while sales “remove” inventory at the cost of goods sold). In our example no “Initial” inventory item is posted so the beginning inventory is zero. Then, by “restating” the inventory balance we must add all the cost amounts from purchase transactions and subtract the “cost_amount” on sale transactions.\n\nStep 1. From the supplied table we first identify all the inventory “Purchase” rows. (Only those rows that list a product – for example “Premium Product A”, “Premium Product B”, “Premium Product C” and “Premium Product D”—are treated as inventory; items such as cash, bank or fixed‐assets are not part of inventory.) Their “amount” is the purchase cost; for example the very first such row is\n\n  • Purchase20231231001 – amount = 140000.0 (for Premium Product C)\n\nListing them all (with the already–computed cost amounts) we obtained the following (all amounts in monetary units):\n\n  Purchase20231231001: 140000.0  \n  Purchase20231231002: 20000.0  \n  Purchase20231231003: 40000.0  \n  Purchase20231231004: 50000.0  \n  Purchase20231231005: 300000.0  \n  Purchase20231231006: 200000.0  \n  Purchase20231231007: 100000.0  \n  Purchase20231231008: 90000.0  \n  Purchase20231231009: 450000.0  \n  Purchase20231231010: 60000.0  \n  Purchase20231231011: 200000.0  \n  Purchase20231231012: 60000.0  \n  Purchase20231231013: 35000.0  \n  Purchase20231231014: 60000.0  \n  Purchase20231231015: 35000.0  \n  Purchase20231231016: 400000.0  \n  Purchase20231231017: 70000.0  \n  Purchase20231231018: 40000.0  \n  Purchase20231231019: 90000.0  \n  Purchase20231231020: 300000.0  \n  Purchase20231231021: 15000.0  \n  Purchase20231231022: 160000.0  \n  Purchase20231231023: 45000.0  \n  Purchase20231231024: 15000.0  \n  Purchase20231231025: 160000.0  \n  Purchase20231231026: 50000.0\n\nWhen we add all these purchase costs we obtain a total of\n\n  Total Purchased = 3,185,000.0\n\nStep 2. Next, from every inventory “Sale” row we must “remove” (i.e. credit) the cost_amount that was recorded at the sale – that is the cost of goods sold. (Note that each sale row gives a “cost_amount” value and that many sale rows appear, each selling one or more inventory units at a “cost‐based” price.) If we add up every sale’s cost_amount we get (summing our many lines) a total of\n\n  Total Sold (COGS) = 2,545,000.0\n\nStep 3. Because no opening inventory exists (it is zero) the final inventory is simply\n\n  Ending Inventory = Total Purchased – Cost of Goods Sold  \n     = 3,185,000.0 – 2,545,000.0  \n     = 640,000.0\n\nThus we conclude that the “Inventory” account on the balance sheet starts at 0.00 and at period–end contains 640000.00 in cost.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Inventory End Value\": \"640000.00\"\n  }\n}\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nNote: (Because the table contains many transactions, we carefully “filtered” only those that add to or remove cost from the inventory; all other cash, bank, fixed asset, or expense transactions are not counted in the inventory value.)\n",
