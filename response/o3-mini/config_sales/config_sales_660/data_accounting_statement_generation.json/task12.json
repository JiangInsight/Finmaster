                        "content": "We need to “build” accounts payable from transactions. In our system, only “Purchase” transactions that use “Account Payable” as the payment method will hit the “accounts payable” ledger. (If a purchase is made and the payment is “Paid” by another method – say “Bank Transfer” or “Cash” – that is paid immediately and not “on account”.)\n\nStep‐by‐step we do the following:\n\n1. Look at the “Initial” transactions (those with id starting with “Initial20231231001”). In this case the initial transactions are only deposits and fixed asset entries. None record an accounts payable balance. So the starting (initial) value of accounts payable is 0.00.\n\n2. Then, every “Purchase” entry that is “Unpaid” (payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\") and whose payment method is “Account Payable” is recorded as an accounts payable liability. In our list the following “Purchase” transactions qualify:\n\n • Purchase20231231001: amount = 140,000.0, payment method “Account Payable” (Unpaid)\n\n • Purchase20231231003: amount = 40,000.0, payment method “Account Payable” (Unpaid)\n\n • Purchase20231231004: amount = 50,000.0, payment method “Account Payable” (Unpaid)\n\n • Purchase20231231007: amount = 100,000.0, payment method “Account Payable” (Unpaid)\n\n • Purchase20231231011: amount = 200,000.0, payment method “Account Payable” (Unpaid)\n\n • Purchase20231231014: amount = 60,000.0, payment method “Account Payable” (Unpaid)\n\n • Purchase20231231017: amount = 70,000.0, payment method “Account Payable” (Unpaid)\n\n • Purchase20231231020: amount = 300,000.0, payment method “Account Payable” (Unpaid)\n\n • Purchase20231231022: amount = 160,000.0, payment method “Account Payable” (Unpaid)\n\n • Purchase20231231023: amount = 45,000.0, payment method “Account Payable” (Unpaid)\n\n • Purchase20231231024: amount = 15,000.0, payment method “Account Payable” (Unpaid)\n\n(Other purchase lines that are “Paid” – or with a different payment method – are not recognized in accounts payable.)\n\n3. Summing these up we get:\n  140,000.0  \n + 40,000.0 = 180,000.0  \n + 50,000.0 = 230,000.0  \n + 100,000.0 = 330,000.0  \n + 200,000.0 = 530,000.0  \n + 60,000.0 = 590,000.0  \n + 70,000.0 = 660,000.0  \n + 300,000.0 = 960,000.0  \n + 160,000.0 = 1,120,000.0  \n + 45,000.0 = 1,165,000.0  \n + 15,000.0 = 1,180,000.0\n\n4. Because we did not record any payments that clear these liabilities, the ending (final) accounts payable balance is the sum of the above, i.e. 1,180,000.00.\n\nThus, our final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"1180000.00\"\n}\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"1180000.00\"}}\n```",
