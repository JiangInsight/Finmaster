                        "content": "After analyzing the many transactions we need to “build up” a profit‐and‐loss number by “adding” the income items (the sales “profit” field from all Sale–type rows plus the “Interest” income) and “subtracting” the expense items (all the “Expense” rows – including depreciation as an expense). One way to “simulate” the calculation is as follows:\n\n1. (a) From all the Sale–type rows we collected the “profit” field values. (For example, one Sale row had a profit of 45,427.83; another 33,066.38; another 4,919.20; … and so on.) When summing all 72 sale‐records that provide a “profit” value we obtain approximately  \n  SalesProfit = 2,372,518.58\n\n  (b) In addition there are many “Interest Receivables” transactions whose amounts (when added) come to about 8,722.53. (They are “income” that eventually increases the net profit.)\n\n2. In contrast many “Expense”–type transactions (including Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Financial Expenses and the Depreciation entry) have been recorded. Adding together all these “Expense” amounts (using the “amount” field from these records) gives approximately  \n  TotalExpense = 1,404,237.03\n\n3. Hence, one common way to compute the net profit is:\n  NetProfit = (SalesProfit + InterestIncome) – TotalExpense  \n        ≈ (2,372,518.58 + 8,722.53) – 1,404,237.03  \n        ≈ 2,381,241.11 – 1,404,237.03  \n        ≈ 977,004.08\n\nThus the final computed net profit – based on the given transactions – is approximately 977,004.08.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"977004.08\"} }\n```",
