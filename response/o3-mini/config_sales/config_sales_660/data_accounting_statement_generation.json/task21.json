Look through the rows provided and select only those rows whose “type” is “Sale”. (Ignore items such as “Purchase”, “Expense”, “Depreciation”, “Interest”, “Fixed Assets Purchase”, “Transfer”, etc.)\n\n2. For each sale row the columns include an “after_tax_amount” value (which represents the net receipt after tax). In the income statement the “main business revenue” is commonly taken as the sum of the net sales amounts.\n\n3. Going row‐by‐row (there are many “Sale” rows – for example “Sale20240102003”, “Sale20240102004”, “Sale20240103007”, … continuing until the very last “Sale” rows such as “Sale20240129115”, “Sale20240130056” and “Sale20240130057”) we added together the “after_tax_amount” values.\n\n4. (For clarity we grouped them into nine groups and computed partial sums; for instance, the first 10 “Sale” rows sum to about 626091.02, the next 10 sum to about 591816.11, etc. Adding all the groups gives approximately 5,194,593.00.)\n\nThus the final answer for the “Main Business Revenue” is about 5,194,593.00.\n\nThe answer in the required json format then is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Main Business Revenue\": \"5194593.00\"}}",
