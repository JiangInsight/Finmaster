                        "content": "We end up “net‐increasing” our cash balance by only the actual cash flows (that is, ignoring the “opening” (initial) entries) – you add up (1) all money actually “received into” your cash or bank – for example, actual cash sales and (2) subtract all cash “paid out” for expenses, purchases paid in cash or by bank transfers (or similar transactions that decrease a cash account). (Note that items such as depreciation or “unpaid” purchases do not move cash; also, the “Initial” rows are the opening cash balances and are not “flows” during the period.) \n\nIn our (very long!) list we first “see” the initial cash: \n  Cash deposit = 3,000,000.0 \n  Bank deposit = 5,000,000.0 \nwhich together provide an opening of 8,000,000. (The “Initial Fixed Assets” posting is not a cash flow.) \n\nThen, when you “sum up” every cash receipt that comes in (for example, sales that are “Paid” in cash or money from the bank) you eventually obtain a “gross inflow” of about 11,416,191.29. (That total includes, of course, the opening numbers – if one were to “sum all rows” without “disqualifying” the opening balance.) \n\nNext – you go through every cash “outflow” (expenses paid in cash, any purchase or fixed asset that is paid by bank transfer, etc) and you find that the sum of cash‐payments comes to about 3,771,929.37.\n\nSince the “Initial” items are not flows during the period you must remove them from the “inflow” total – that is, subtract the opening 8,000,000. (They “set” the starting balance, but the net change during the period is computed from the other flows.) \n\nThus, the “cash‑flow during the period” is computed as:\n\n  Net cash flow = (Total “inflows” – opening items) – (Total “outflows”)\n          = (11,416,191.29 – 8,000,000.00) – 3,771,929.37\n          ≈ 3,416,191.29 – 3,771,929.37 \n          ≈ –355,738.08\n\nIn other words, over the period the cash and bank balance “fell” by about 355,738.08.\n\nBelow is our final answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"-355738.08\"} }\n```",
