                        "content": "We first need to compute some averages and then use the formulas below. Note that in our calculations, when a beginning balance is provided (and it is zero for Accounts Receivable) we compute the average as (Beginning + Ending)/2.\n\nStep 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n• Formula: (Total Revenue) ÷ (Average Accounts Receivable)  \n• Here, Total Revenue = 5,064,939.23  \n• Beginning Accounts Receivable = 0.00 and Ending Accounts Receivable = 1,851,327.29  \n  ⇒ Average AR = (0.00 + 1,851,327.29) / 2 = 925,663.645  \n• Ratio = 5,064,939.23 ÷ 925,663.645 ≈ 5.47  \n\nStep 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio (and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio)  \n• We use the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities and Current Liabilities.  \n• Here, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –64,099.10  \n• Total Current Liabilities at end = 1,493,246.99  \n• Ratio = –64,099.10 ÷ 1,493,246.99 ≈ –0.04293, which can be rounded to –0.04  \n• (In the sample problem these two ratios are the same.)  \n\nStep 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n• Formula: (Total Revenue) ÷ (Average Total Assets)  \n• Total Assets at beginning = 13,000,000.00 and at end = 15,200,446.16  \n  ⇒ Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 15,200,446.16) / 2 = 14,100,223.08  \n• Ratio = 5,064,939.23 ÷ 14,100,223.08 ≈ 0.3596, rounded to 0.36  \n\nStep 4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n• Formula: (Total Liabilities) ÷ (Total Owner's Equity)  \n• In our balance sheet, the only liabilities given are the current liabilities, which is 1,493,246.99  \n• Total Owner's Equity at end = 13,707,199.17  \n• Ratio = 1,493,246.99 ÷ 13,707,199.17 ≈ 0.1089, rounded to 0.11  \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"5.47\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-0.04\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.04\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.36\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\"\n  }\n}",
