                        "content": "We first determine which number to use for the \"debt\" portion. In the provided example the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio was calculated as the net cash flow from operating activities divided by the Total Current Liabilities. In the example this was:\n\n  Ratio = (–7,259,994.10) / (1,861,550.92) ≈ –3.90\n\nFor the problem at hand, we use the same approach.\n\nStep 1. Identify the net cash flow from operating activities from the cash flow statement:  \n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –64,099.10\n\nStep 2. Identify the total current liabilities from the balance sheet:  \n  Total Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n\nStep 3. Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio using the formula:  \n  Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Current Liabilities)  \n  = –64,099.10 / 1,493,246.99  \n  ≈ –0.04294\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the ratio is –0.04.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.04\"\n  }\n}",
