                        "content": "We start by calculating the Gross Profit Margin. The Gross Profit Margin is defined as:\n\n  Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n  Gross Profit = 2,329,939.23  \n  Total Revenue = 5,064,939.23\n\nSo,\n  Gross Profit Margin = (2,329,939.23 / 5,064,939.23) × 100  \n    = 0.4599 × 100  \n    ≈ 46.00%\n\nNext, we calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio. In these examples, the typical approach is to use the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities and total current liabilities (which serve as the debt figure in this context):\n\n  Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -64,099.10  \n  Total Current Liabilities (from the balance sheet) = 1,493,246.99\n\nThus,\n  Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -64,099.10 / 1,493,246.99  \n    ≈ -0.04293\n\nRounded to two decimal places, this ratio is approximately -0.04.\n\nSo the final solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"46.00%\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.04\"\n  }\n}",
