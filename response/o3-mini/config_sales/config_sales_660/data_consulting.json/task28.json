                        "content": "We start by identifying the needed numbers from the statements and then calculating the three ratios:\n\n1. Debt to Asset Ratio:\n • From the balance sheet, the Total Liabilities can be determined as the difference between Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity and Total Assets. Here,\n  – Total Owner's Equity = 13707199.17 \n  – Total Assets = 15200446.16 \n  – Total Liabilities = Total Assets − Total Owner's Equity = 15200446.16 − 13707199.17 = 1493246.99.\n • Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities ÷ Total Assets = 1493246.99 ÷ 15200446.16 ≈ 0.0983, which rounds to 0.10.\n\n2. Gross Profit Margin:\n • From the income statement,\n  – Gross Profit = 2329939.23 \n  – Total Revenue = 5064939.23.\n • Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit ÷ Total Revenue) × 100 = (2329939.23 ÷ 5064939.23) × 100 ≈ 46.01%.\n\n3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\n • From the cash flow statement,\n  – Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –64099.10 \n  – Total Current Liabilities = 1493246.99.\n • Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities ÷ Total Current Liabilities = –64099.10 ÷ 1493246.99 ≈ –0.0429, which rounds to –0.04.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Gross Profit Margin': '46.01%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.04'}}",
