                        "content": "First, we extract the key numbers from the three statements. (Note: In the absence of non‐current liabilities, we take Total Liabilities as the Total Current Liabilities.)\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n1. From the Balance Sheet (all “End_amount” numbers as of 2024‑01‑29):\n\n• Cash on Hand = 4,540,900.90  \n• Bank Deposits = 2,866,063.83  \n• Interest Receivable = 8,967.44  \n• Accounts Receivable = 1,851,327.29  \n• Inventory = 450,000.00  \n• Total Current Assets = 9,717,259.46  \n• Fixed Assets = 5,528,936.17  \n• Accumulated Depreciation = 45,749.47  \n• Total Non‑current Assets = 5,483,186.70  \n• Total Assets = 15,200,446.16  \n\nLiabilities & Owners’ Equity:  \n• Accounts Payable = 1,240,000.00  \n• Taxes Payable = 253,246.99  \n• Total Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99  \n• Paid‑in Capital = 13,000,000.00  \n• Retained Earnings = 707,199.17  \n• Total Owner’s Equity = 13,707,199.17  \n\n─────────────────────────────  \n2. From the Cash Flow Statement:\n\nOperating activities:  \n• Net Profit = 707,199.17  \n• Depreciation = 45,749.47  \n• (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable = –1,851,327.29  \n• (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable = –8,967.44  \n• (Increase) Decrease in Inventory = –450,000.00  \n• Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable = 1,240,000.00  \n• Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable = 253,246.99  \n\n• Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –64,099.10  \n\n─────────────────────────────  \n3. From the Income Statement:\n\n• Main Business Revenue = 5,064,939.23  \n• Total Revenue = 5,064,939.23  \n• Cost of Goods Sold = 2,735,000.00  \n• Gross Profit = 2,329,939.23  \n• Total Expenses (Admin, Selling, Depreciation & Financial Expenses) = 1,378,460.51  \n• Interest Income = 8,967.44  \n• Profit Before Tax = 960,446.16  \n• Tax Expense = 253,246.99  \n• Net Profit = 707,199.17  \n\n─────────────────────────────  \nNow, let’s compute each ratio step by step:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n   = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Current Liabilities)  \n   = (–64,099.10) / (1,493,246.99)  \n   ≈ –0.0429  \n   Rounded to two decimals: –0.04  \n\n2. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n   (Assuming only current liabilities represent debt)  \n   = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity  \n   = (1,493,246.99) / (13,707,199.17)  \n   ≈ 0.1089  \n   Rounded to two decimals: 0.11  \n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n   = Total Revenue / Total Assets  \n   = 5,064,939.23 / 15,200,446.16  \n   ≈ 0.333  \n   Rounded to two decimals: 0.33  \n\n4. Quick Ratio  \n   (Quick Assets = Current Assets excluding Inventory)  \n   = (Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities  \n   First, sum the quick assets:  \n   = 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 + 8,967.44 + 1,851,327.29  \n   = 9,267,259.46  \n   Then:  \n   = 9,267,259.46 / 1,493,246.99  \n   ≈ 6.208  \n   Rounded to two decimals: 6.21  \n\n5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n   (This is essentially the same as Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio)  \n   = –64,099.10 / 1,493,246.99  \n   ≈ –0.04  \n\n6. Return on Equity (ROE)  \n   = (Net Profit) / (Total Owner’s Equity)  \n   = 707,199.17 / 13,707,199.17  \n   ≈ 0.0516, i.e. 5.16% when expressed as a percentage  \n\n7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n   (Calculated as Revenue divided by average accounts receivable. Since initial AR was 0 and end AR is 1,851,327.29, the average AR = (0 + 1,851,327.29)/2.)  \n   Average Accounts Receivable = 1,851,327.29 / 2  \n   = 925,663.645  \n   \n   Then,  \n   Accounts Receivable Turnover = Main Business Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n   = 5,064,939.23 / 925,663.645  \n   ≈ 5.47  \n\n─────────────────────────────  \nNow, we provide the results in the required JSON output format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.04\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.33\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"6.21\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.04\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"5.16%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"5.47\"\n  }\n}",
