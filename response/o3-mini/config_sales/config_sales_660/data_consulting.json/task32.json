                        "content": "Step 1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n• From the cash‐flow statement, we add Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities and Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities. \n  Operating CF = –64,099.10 \n  Investing CF = –528,936.17 \n  FCF = –64,099.10 + (–528,936.17) = –593,035.27\n\nStep 2. Return on Assets (ROA)\n• ROA is calculated as Net Profit divided by the average Total Assets.\n  Beginning Total Assets = 13,000,000.00 \n  Ending Total Assets = 15,200,446.16 \n  Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 15,200,446.16) / 2 = 14,100,223.08 \n  Net Profit = 707,199.17 \n  ROA = (707,199.17 / 14,100,223.08) × 100 ≈ 5.02%\n\nStep 3. Return on Equity (ROE)\n• ROE is calculated as Net Profit divided by the average Owner’s Equity.\n  Beginning Owner’s Equity = 13,000,000.00 \n  Ending Owner’s Equity = 13,707,199.17 \n  Average Owner’s Equity = (13,000,000.00 + 13,707,199.17) / 2 = 13,353,599.59 \n  ROE = (707,199.17 / 13,353,599.59) × 100 ≈ 5.30%\n\nStep 4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n• This ratio is calculated as Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities divided by Net Profit.\n  = (–64,099.10 / 707,199.17) ≈ –0.09\n\nStep 5. Net Profit Margin\n• Net Profit Margin is found by dividing Net Profit by Total Revenue.\n  Total Revenue = 5,064,939.23 \n  = (707,199.17 / 5,064,939.23) × 100 ≈ 13.96%\n\nStep 6. Gross Profit Margin\n• Gross Profit Margin is calculated as Gross Profit divided by Total Revenue.\n  Gross Profit = 2,329,939.23 \n  = (2,329,939.23 / 5,064,939.23) × 100 ≈ 46.00%\n\nBased on these calculations, the final results are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-593035.27\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"5.02%\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"5.30%\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-0.09\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"13.96%\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"46.00%\"\n  }\n}",
