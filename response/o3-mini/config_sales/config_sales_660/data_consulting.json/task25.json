                        "content": "We need to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial information. Here is a step‐by‐step breakdown:\n\n1. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n• From the balance sheet the Total Liabilities come from the difference between “Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity” and “Total Owner's Equity”. In our case, the only liabilities provided are the “Total Current Liabilities”.  \n  Total Liabilities = 15200446.16 – 13707199.17 = 1493246.99  \n  Total Owner's Equity = 13707199.17  \n• Thus,  \n  Debt to Equity Ratio = 1493246.99 / 13707199.17 ≈ 0.1089, which rounds to 0.11  \n\n2. Net Profit Margin  \n• Using the income statement,  \n  Net Profit = 707199.17  \n  Total Revenue = 5064939.23  \n• Therefore,  \n  Net Profit Margin = (707199.17 / 5064939.23) ≈ 0.13964 or 13.96%  \n\n3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n• From the cash flow statement,  \n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –64099.10  \n  Total Current Liabilities = 1493246.99  \n• Thus,  \n  Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = (–64099.10 / 1493246.99) ≈ –0.04295, which rounds to –0.04  \n\nOur final answer in the requested JSON format is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"13.96%\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.04\"\n  }\n}",
