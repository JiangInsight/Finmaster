                        "content": "We first need to extract the relevant numbers from the three statements. In our case the figures (all “end” values) are as follows:\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. From the Balance Sheet at 2024‐01‐29:\n• Cash on Hand = 4,540,900.90  \n• Bank Deposits = 2,866,063.83  \n• Interest Receivable = 8,967.44  \n• Accounts Receivable = 1,851,327.29  \n• Inventory = 450,000.00  \n\n• Total Current Assets = 9,717,259.46  \n• Current Liabilities (Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable) = 1,240,000.00 + 253,246.99 = 1,493,246.99\n\n• Total Owner’s Equity = 13,707,199.17\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. From the Cash Flow Statement (operating activities):\n• Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –64,099.10  \n(This “Operating Cash Flow” figure will be used in two ratios.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. From the Income Statement:\n• Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = 2,735,000.00  \n(For the Inventory Turnover Ratio we also need average inventory. Since beginning inventory is 0 and ending inventory is 450,000.00, the average inventory = 450,000.00 / 2 = 225,000.00.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nNow let’s calculate each ratio step by step.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n= (–64,099.10) / 1,493,246.99  \n≈ –0.04296  \nRounded to two decimals (for consistency with example): –0.04\n\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \n(This ratio is defined in many cases as Operating Cash Flow / Debt. In our example the “Debt” used was the current liabilities.)  \nThus, it is the same calculation as above:  \n= (–64,099.10) / 1,493,246.99  \n≈ –0.04\n\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio  \nFormula: COGS / Average Inventory  \n= 2,735,000.00 / 225,000.00  \n≈ 12.1556  \nRounded to two decimals: 12.16\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \nFormula: Total Debt / Total Owner’s Equity  \n(Here, “Debt” is taken as the current liabilities)  \n= 1,493,246.99 / 13,707,199.17  \n≈ 0.1089  \nRounded to two decimals: 0.11\n\n5. Quick Ratio  \nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable  \n= 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 + 8,967.44 + 1,851,327.29  \n= 9,267,259.46  \nThen,  \nQuick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities  \n= 9,267,259.46 / 1,493,246.99  \n≈ 6.206  \nRounded to two decimals: 6.21\n\n6. Current Ratio  \nFormula: Total Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \n= 9,717,259.46 / 1,493,246.99  \n≈ 6.512  \nRounded to two decimals: 6.51\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThus, our final results are:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.04', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.04', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '12.16', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Quick Ratio': '6.21', 'Current Ratio': '6.51'}}",
