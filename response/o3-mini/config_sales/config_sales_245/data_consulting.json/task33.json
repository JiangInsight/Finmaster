                        "content": "We can solve the problem step by step as follows:\n\nStep 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n Formula: Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities  \n From the Cash Flow statement, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 215423.24  \n From the Balance Sheet, Total Current Liabilities = 1124588.25  \n Calculation: 215423.24 / 1124588.25 ≈ 0.1916, which we round to 0.19\n\nStep 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \n Usually the “debt” here is taken as Total Liabilities (or in our simplified case, current liabilities if no borrowings are shown separately).  \n Using the same numbers: 215423.24 / 1124588.25 ≈ 0.1916, or 0.19\n\nStep 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio  \n Formula: Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  \n Note: Since the initial inventory is 0 and the ending inventory is given, the average inventory = (0 + Ending Inventory)/2  \n Given: COGS = 3250000.00 from the Income Statement; Ending Inventory = 975000.00  \n Average Inventory = 975000.00 / 2 = 487500.00  \n Calculation: 3250000.00 / 487500.00 ≈ 6.6667, rounded to 6.67\n\nStep 4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n Formula: Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Owner’s Equity  \n Assuming that the only debt represented is the current liabilities of 1124588.25  \n From the Balance Sheet, Total Owner’s Equity = 14163543.07  \n Calculation: 1124588.25 / 14163543.07 ≈ 0.07943, or about 0.08\n\nStep 5. Quick Ratio  \n Formula: Quick Ratio = (Current Assets – Inventory) / Current Liabilities  \n From the Balance Sheet, Current Assets = 10333889.03 and Inventory = 975000.00  \n Quick Assets = 10333889.03 – 975000.00 = 9358889.03  \n Calculation: 9358889.03 / 1124588.25 ≈ 8.317, rounded to 8.32\n\nStep 6. Current Ratio  \n Formula: Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \n Calculation: 10333889.03 / 1124588.25 ≈ 9.188, rounded to 9.19\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"0.19\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"0.19\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"6.67\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.08\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"8.32\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"9.19\"\n  }\n}",
