                        "content": "We first extract the key numbers from the three statements:\n\n• From the cash flow statement, we have:\n – Net Profit = 1,163,543.07 \n – Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 215,423.24\n\n• From the income statement, we have:\n – Total Revenue = 5,991,764.34\n\n• From the balance sheet (end amounts), we have:\n – Current Assets = 10,333,889.03 \n  ○ (This is given as “Total Current Assets” on 2024-01-29)\n – Initial Current Assets = 8,000,000.00 (from 2023-12-31)\n – Quick assets (we include Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, and Accounts Receivable):\n  ○ Cash on Hand = 4,560,423.24 \n  ○ Bank Deposits = 3,655,000.00 \n  ○ Interest Receivable = 10,051.66 \n  ○ Accounts Receivable = 1,133,414.13\n    Sum of Quick Assets = 4,560,423.24 + 3,655,000.00 + 10,051.66 + 1,133,414.13 ≈ 9,358,889.03\n – Current Liabilities (from end amounts):\n  ○ Accounts Payable = 825,000.00 \n  ○ Taxes Payable = 299,588.25 \n    Sum = 1,124,588.25\n\nNow we calculate the three ratios:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio \n  = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Net Profit)\n  = 215,423.24 / 1,163,543.07\n  ≈ 0.1852, which we round to 0.19\n\n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio \n  = (Total Revenue) / (Average Current Assets)\n  First, calculate the average current assets:\n   Average Current Assets = (Beginning Current Assets + Ending Current Assets) / 2\n    = (8,000,000.00 + 10,333,889.03) / 2\n    ≈ 9,166,944.52\n  Thus, the ratio = 5,991,764.34 / 9,166,944.52 ≈ 0.6536, rounded to 0.65\n\n3. Quick Ratio \n  = (Quick Assets) / (Current Liabilities)\n  = 9,358,889.03 / 1,124,588.25\n  ≈ 8.317, which rounds to 8.32\n\nThus, the final answers are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"0.19\",\n    \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.65\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"8.32\"\n  }\n}",
