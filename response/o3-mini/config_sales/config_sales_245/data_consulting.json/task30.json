                        "content": "We will calculate the following ratios using the \"End_amount\" values in the provided balance sheet and cash flow statement as of 2024‐01‐29.\n\nStep 1. Current Ratio\n\n• Current Ratio = (Total Current Assets) / (Total Current Liabilities)\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n Total Current Assets = 10,333,889.03  \n Total Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n\nCalculation:\n Current Ratio = 10,333,889.03 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 9.19\n\nStep 2. Quick Ratio\n\n• Quick Ratio = (Current Assets – Inventory) / (Current Liabilities)\n\nSubtract Inventory from Total Current Assets:\n Inventory = 975,000.00  \n Quick Assets = 10,333,889.03 – 975,000.00 = 9,358,889.03\n\nThen,\n Quick Ratio = 9,358,889.03 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 8.32\n\nStep 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n• Debt to Asset Ratio = (Total Liabilities) / (Total Assets)\n\nIn this balance sheet, Total Liabilities (only current liabilities) = 1,124,588.25 and\n Total Assets = 15,288,131.32\n\nThus,\n Debt to Asset Ratio = 1,124,588.25 / 15,288,131.32 ≈ 0.07\n\nStep 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n• Debt to Equity Ratio = (Total Liabilities) / (Total Owner’s Equity)\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n Total Owner’s Equity = 14,163,543.07\n\nThen,\n Debt to Equity Ratio = 1,124,588.25 / 14,163,543.07 ≈ 0.08\n\nStep 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n• Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Liabilities)\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 215,423.24  \n Total Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n\nThus,\n Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = 215,423.24 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 0.19\n\nThe final answer in the required json format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"9.19\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"8.32\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.07\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.08\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"0.19\"\n  }\n}",
