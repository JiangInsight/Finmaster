The costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers. In our example input the related line item is found in the income statement. Based on the similarity to our example, this is represented by the Selling Expenses. In the income statement provided, the Selling Expenses value is 782775.93.\n\n2. The cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets. In our example input, this is represented on the cash flow statement by the Purchase of Fixed Assets. In the cash flow statement provided, the Purchase of Fixed Assets value is 0.00.\n\nThus, the two specific extracted values are:\nValue1 (cost to secure/deliver): 782775.93  \nValue2 (cash payment on fixed assets): 0.00\n\nThe final answer is provided below in the required JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"value1\": \"782775.93\", \"value2\": \"0.00\"}\n}",
