                        "content": "We start from the “Initial20231231001” record that sets up three accounts. Out of those three, the “Fixed Assets” entry causes a non‐current (property, plant, and equipment) asset of 5,000,000.00 on the balance sheet (the other two – cash and bank – are current assets).\n\nThen, during the period a depreciation transaction is recorded. In this case the “Depreciation20240101001” record has an amount of 45,757.71. (In many accounting systems accumulated depreciation is deducted from the carrying value of fixed assets.) There are no additional fixed asset purchases (or disposals) among the later transactions (the purchase transactions, although many in number, refer to products that are treated as inventory rather than long‑term fixed assets).\n\nThus the ending balance for non‑current assets is computed as follows:\n\n  Ending fixed assets = Initial fixed asset balance − Depreciation  \n    = 5,000,000.00 − 45,757.71  \n    ≈ 4,954,242.29\n\nSo our answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '4954242.29'}}",
