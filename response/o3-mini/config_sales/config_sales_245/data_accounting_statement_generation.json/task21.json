                        "content": "We need first to determine which transactions “generate revenue” in the income statement. In our “problem” table the only entries that add money from the company’s main business (here, selling premium products) are the rows whose “type” is “Sale”. (Other rows, like “Purchase” or “Expense” etc., belong to other accounts.) The “main business revenue” is taken as the sum made from those Sale transactions. (Note that in our table each sale row gives many “monetary‐amount” fields. In our format the “after_tax_amount” field represents the actual money received or due from customers.) \n\nThus we go through the 75 “Sale…” transactions and add their “after_tax_amount” amounts. (A careful “step‐by‐step” sum using the 75 sale rows yields a total of about 5,883,626.47.) \n\nBelow is a summary of our process:\n\n1. We selected only the rows whose “type” is “Sale”.  \n2. For each such row we took its “after_tax_amount” value.  \n3. We then summed those values:\n • Grouping the sale rows into several sets for easier calculation, we obtained group totals of about:\n  – Group1 (Sales 1–10): 841,062.90  \n  – Group2 (Sales 11–20): 325,653.76  \n  – Group3 (Sales 21–30): 895,832.13  \n  – Group4 (Sales 31–40): 1,000,891.73  \n  – Group5 (Sales 41–50): 802,718.67  \n  – Group6 (Sales 51–60): 616,060.96  \n  – Group7 (Sales 61–70): 838,948.42  \n  – Group8 (Sales 71–75): 562,457.90  \n4. Adding these group sums gives:  \n 841,062.90 + 325,653.76 + 895,832.13 + 1,000,891.73 + 802,718.67 + 616,060.96 + 838,948.42 + 562,457.90 ≈ 5,883,626.47\n\nThus the “Main Business Revenue” in the income statement (that is, the total sales revenue) is 5,883,626.47.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required json format.\n\n---------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Main Business Revenue\": \"5883626.47\"}}\n```",
