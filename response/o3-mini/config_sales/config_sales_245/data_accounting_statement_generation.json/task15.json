                        "content": "We first notice that the “Initial” transactions (those with id “Initial20231231001”) list only assets – cash, bank deposits, and fixed assets. (The “initial balance‐sheet” for liabilities is given as zero.) \n\nThen to “build up” the ending liabilities figure we look at transactions that record purchases made on account (that is, those with payment/receipt_status “Unpaid” and a payment_method of “Account Payable”). In our table these are the purchase transactions that did not get “paid” yet. (Other types such as “Sale” even if “Unpaid” are “receivables” – an asset – while “Interest Receivables” also belong on the asset side.)\n\nGoing down the list we identify the following rows that contribute to liabilities:\n \n1. Row with id “Purchase20231231005”: amount = 35,000.0, status “Unpaid” (and payment_method “Account Payable”).\n2. Row “Purchase20231231009”: amount = 50,000.0, Unpaid, payment_method “Account Payable”.\n3. Row “Purchase20231231012”: amount = 35,000.0, Unpaid, payment_method “Account Payable”.\n4. Row “Purchase20231231013”: amount = 45,000.0, Unpaid, payment_method “Account Payable”.\n5. Row “Purchase20231231014”: amount = 400,000.0, Unpaid, payment_method “Account Payable”.\n6. Row “Purchase20231231020”: amount = 30,000.0, Unpaid, payment_method “Account Payable”.\n7. Row “Purchase20231231026”: amount = 140,000.0, Unpaid, payment_method “Account Payable”.\n\nNow we sum these amounts:\n  35,000.0 + 50,000.0 = 85,000.0  \n  85,000.0 + 35,000.0 = 120,000.0  \n  120,000.0 + 45,000.0 = 165,000.0  \n  165,000.0 + 400,000.0 = 565,000.0  \n  565,000.0 + 30,000.0 = 595,000.0  \n  595,000.0 + 140,000.0 = 735,000.0\n\nThus the end‐of‐period liabilities total is 735,000.00.\n\nIn summary, the “Initial Liabilities” were zero (since no initial liability entries were provided) and the “Final Liabilities” total 735,000.00.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"735000.00\"}}\n--------------------------------------------------",
