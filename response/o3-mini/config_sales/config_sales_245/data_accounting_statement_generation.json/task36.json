(In our example the “profit” column on each sale row was already computed as the difference between that sale’s after–tax amount and its “cost_amount” – i.e. its “gross profit”. However, then you must subtract all operating (and other) expense items – such as the various “Expense” rows (sales, administrative and financial) as well as the “Depreciation”–expense – and add any “other revenue” such as interest receivables.) \n\nIn our case the steps were (approximately):\n\n1. Sum up all profit figures given with the sale transactions. In our long table the sale rows (whose profit numbers appear in the right–most column) add up to about\n\n  Sales profit total ≈ 2,783,343.69\n\n2. Sum up all “other income” from “Interest Receivables” (which are not included in the sale “profit” sum). In our data the many interest transactions (with amounts such as 427.20, 376.47, … plus one “odd” small interest of about 14.65) add up approximately to\n\n  Interest income ≈ 10,066.35\n\n3. Sum up all expense lines (the “Expense …” transactions and the Depreciation row). (Do not “re‐expense” purchases because their cost is (partially) built in already – the sale “cost_amount” figures – so these are not operating expenses.) Adding all the “Expense” rows plus the Depreciation row gives approximately\n\n  Total expenses ≈ 1,337,971.73\n\n4. Now the net profit is computed by adding the operating incomes and then subtracting expenses:\n  \n  Net profit ≈ (Sales profit + Interest income) – Total operating expenses \n        ≈ (2,783,343.69 + 10,066.35) – 1,337,971.73 \n        ≈ 2,793,410.04 – 1,337,971.73 \n        ≈ 1,455,438.31\n\nThus, the final net profit item (i.e. the “bottom–line” for the cash flow/income statement) comes out to about 1,455,438.31.\n\nWe now report the answer in the required JSON format.\n\nFinal answer:\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"1455438.31\"}} \n\nNote: Because the table contains hundreds of lines with many decimals, the numbers are approximate.",
