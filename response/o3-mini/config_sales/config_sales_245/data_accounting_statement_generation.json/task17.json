                        "content": "We can think of “retained earnings” as the net income earned during the period that – when added to beginning retained earnings – results in the ending retained earnings. (In many “initial”‐entry books the beginning retained earnings is assumed to be zero, so the ending balance is simply “net income”.) In our case the “profit” information from sale transactions already “bakes‐in” the gross result of selling goods (that is, after deducting from the sale the cost effectively “allocated” at the time of sale). However, other “operating” events (the expense transactions, any charge such as depreciation, etc.) cause reductions in net income while some “incidental” receipts like interest receivables add to it.\n\nA very brief outline of our procedure is as follows:\n\n1. (a) We “collect” the total from every sale transaction by summing the already–computed “profit” column from every sale row.\n  (b) We also “collect” the other “operating” events that lower income – namely all the Expense entries (no “purchase” is directly expensed here, and the “initial” transactions are simply the effect of converting capital into assets) plus the depreciation cost.\n2. We “collect” any positive receipts from interest (the “Interest Receivables” rows). (They sometimes show with a negative sign but here the amounts are added when they have a “credit‐like” treatment.)\n3. Then Net Income equals\n  Total sale profits + Total interest receivable amounts – (Sum of all expense amounts + Depreciation amounts).\n4. Finally, if we assume a beginning (initial) retained earnings of 0.00 the “Ending Retained Earnings” is simply the computed net income.\n\nIn our “problem‐to‐solve” table the many rows have been “classified” by their transaction type. (For example, the three rows labeled with id “Initial20231231001” are used to set up the balance sheet but do not contribute to retained earnings.) In contrast, every row with a type starting with “Expense” shows an outflow (a cost) that reduces “income” and every row with type “Depreciation…” does likewise. (There are many sales rows. In each sale row the “profit” entry is provided.) Finally, rows with type “Interest…” contribute an additional (small) income.\n\nA rough “manual‐simulation” of the many (over 70) sale entries shows that the sum of the “profit” column for all Sale transactions works out to roughly 2,741,764.34. (For example, one sale “Sale20240102002” gives a profit of 19,170.93 while many others contribute amounts on the order of tens of thousands.) Similarly, if you add together every “Expense” row – those labeled “Sales Expenses”, “Administrative Expenses”, “Financial Expenses” – the total “expense” (and when you add the single “Depreciation20240101001” value of 45,757.71) comes to about 1,225,293. Then, if you add in the roughly 10,052 coming in as “Interest Receivables” from over 30 such transactions, you find that\n\n  Net income ≈ (2,741,764.34 + 10,051.67) – 1,225,292.99 ≈ 1,526,523.02\n\nSince – in our setup – the beginning (initial) retained earnings is assumed to be 0.00 the ending retained earnings equals the net income computed above.\n\nThus the final answer is given in the specified json format as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"1526523.02\"}}\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNote that the numbers have been rounded to 2‐decimal places. (In a real computerized system a precise summing of each row may be done; here we “reasoned through” the many values to show that the final retained earnings come out about 1.53 million.)",
