                        "content": "We can “build” the balance‐sheet current liabilities by “pin‐pointing” those transactions in our record that create payables that have not yet been paid. In our working paper the only items that lead to a current liability (as of the period’s end) are Purchase transactions that remain “Unpaid” (that is, with payment/receipt_status = Unpaid and (sometimes) the payment_method—such as “Account Payable”) because those represent outstanding obligations to suppliers.\n\nStep 1. Look at the “Initial” transactions. They show the opening “deposits” and “fixed assets” (the usual opening asset entries); no current liability is “recorded” on the opening balance. Thus the Total Current Liabilities Initial Value is 0.00.\n\nStep 2. Go through the “Purchase” transactions in the table, and pick out those whose status is “Unpaid” (if a purchase was already paid then the obligation has been satisfied and does not appear as a current liability). (Other categories like “Sales” – even when “Unpaid” – are receivables (assets) rather than payables; and expense items have been paid so they do not create a liability.) In our data the following Purchase entries are “Unpaid”:\n\n• Purchase20231231005 – Amount: 35,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231009 – Amount: 50,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231012 – Amount: 35,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231013 – Amount: 45,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231014 – Amount: 400,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231020 – Amount: 30,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231026 – Amount: 140,000.0  \n\nStep 3. Sum these amounts:\n 35,000 + 50,000 = 85,000  \n 85,000 + 35,000 = 120,000  \n 120,000 + 45,000 = 165,000  \n 165,000 + 400,000 = 565,000  \n 565,000 + 30,000 = 595,000  \n 595,000 + 140,000 = 735,000\n\nThus the “current liabilities at period end” total 735,000.00.\n\nStep 4. Report the answer in the required JSON format.\n\nThe final answer is therefore:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"735000.00\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis is our solution based on the interpretation that only unpaid purchase obligations (which use a payment method such as “Account Payable”) form our current liabilities for this period.",
