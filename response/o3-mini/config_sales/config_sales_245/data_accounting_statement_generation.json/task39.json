                        "content": "We must “close‐down” the interest receivables into the cash flow statement by comparing the ending balance of interest receivable at period‑end (which is entirely the sum of the “Interest Receivables” entries recorded during the period when none were collected) against an assumed zero beginning balance. In our case we “pick out” every transaction row whose type is Interest Receivables and then add their amounts (a positive “accrual” implies that the company has recorded interest income that has not yet been received in cash; an increase in receivable is a use of cash).\n\nStep 1. Identify all “Interest Receivables” transactions. For example, the data include entries with id’s like:\n • Interest20240101001 with 427.20  \n • Interest20240102002 with 376.47  \n • Interest20240103003 with 376.47  \n • Interest20240104004 with 358.67  \n • Interest20240105005 with 358.67  \n • Interest20240106006 with 358.67  \n • Interest20240107007 with 358.67  \n • Interest20240108008 with 358.67  \n • Interest20240109009 with 358.67  \n • Interest20240110010 with 358.67  \n • Interest20240111011 with 346.21  \n • Interest20240112012 with 346.21  \n • Interest20240113013 with 346.21  \n • Interest20240114014 with 335.53  \n • Interest20240115015 with 335.53  \n • Interest20240116016 with 335.53  \n • Interest20240117017 with 335.53  \n • Interest20240118018 with 335.53  \n • Interest20240119019 with 335.53  \n • Interest20240120020 with 335.53  \n • Interest20240121021 with 335.53  \n • Interest20240122022 with 334.20 (approximately)  \n • Interest20240123023 with 334.20  \n • Interest20240124024 with 334.20  \n • Interest20240125025 with 334.20  \n • Interest20240126026 with 325.295  \n • Interest20240127027 with 325.295  \n • Interest20240128028 with 325.295  \n • Interest20240129029 with 325.295\n\nStep 2. Sum all these amounts:\n • The first 3 add to: 427.20 + 376.47 + 376.47 = 1,180.14  \n • The next 7 (each ~358.67) contribute about 7×358.67 = 2,510.69 (running total 3,690.83)  \n • The following 3 (each 346.21) add 1,038.63 (running total 4,729.46)  \n • Then 1 + 3 more groups of entries at 335.53 add in four steps (4×335.53 = 1,342.12) taking the total to 7,413.70  \n • Four entries at about 334.20 add 1,336.78 (=> 8,750.48)  \n • Finally four entries at about 325.295 add 1,301.18 (total = 10,051.66)\n\nStep 3. Because no offsetting collections are shown the receivable balance “increased” by 10,051.66. (In a cash flow statement an increase in a current asset is reported as a negative adjustment – a use of cash.)\n\nThus, on the cash flow statement the “(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable” item is –10,051.66.\n\nThe final answer in the required json format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-10051.66\"\n  }\n}",
