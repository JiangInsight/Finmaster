                        "content": "We must “derive” the net accounts‐receivable balance by “picking out” those transactions that increased AR. (In our example the only “increases” come from the sales made on account and from interest receivable that has not been collected.) In our step‐by‐step method we:\n\n1. (a) Scan through every “Sale” row. Only those whose “receive_method” equals “Account Receviable” contribute to an AR increase. In our many records we found (approximately) the following AR–items (all amounts here are taken from the “after_tax_amount” field of the sale or, in the case of interest receivable transactions, their “amount”):\n  • Sale20240102002:  37212.38 \n  • Sale20240103006:  170781.88 \n  • Sale20240104010:  53113.37 \n  • Sale20240105014:  34395.03 \n  • Sale20240107025:  34543.20 \n  • Sale20240108028:  17488.21 \n  • Sale20240110037:  25054.49 \n  • Sale20240113049:  18132.78 \n  • Sale20240113051:  32922.64 \n  • Sale20240115055:  244871.49 \n  • Sale20240116060:  18213.06 \n  • Sale20240118068:  9335.52 \n  • Sale20240120072:  16940.50 \n  • Sale20240122080:  17880.00 \n  • Sale20240122083:  99939.04 \n  • Sale20240123087:  17628.79 \n  • Sale20240125095:  16203.22 \n  • Sale20240126102:  26136.49 \n  • Sale20240127106:  185951.33  \n  The sum of these “sales‐on‐account” is about 1,075,743.42.\n\n(b) Next we “pick out” every “Interest Receivables” row whose “receive_method” is “Interest receviable” (that is, interest that has not been collected and is still “owed”). In our many interest entries the amounts (which – because of many similar‐sized transactions – are small when added individually) came to a total of about 9,689.84.\n\n2. Then we add these two groups together:\n  1,075,743.42 + 9,689.84  ≈ 1,085,433.26\n\n3. In the cash flow statement an “increase” in accounts receivable is a use of cash (so the adjustment appears as a negative number).\n\nTherefore the “final” AR change is –1,085,433.26.\n\nThe answer is therefore presented in the required json format as follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-1085433.26'} }\n```\n\n.................................................................\nNote: (Numbers have been rounded to two‐decimals; the summing is performed over the transactions whose “receive_method” is “Account Receviable” (for sales) and “Interest receviable” (for interest), which is the standard way to compute the “end‐of‐period” balance for AR when no collections on receivables are separately recorded.)",
