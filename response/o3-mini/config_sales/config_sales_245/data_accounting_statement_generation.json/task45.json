(Investing activities normally include uses of cash for acquiring—and sometimes disposing of—long‑term assets, such as fixed assets.)\n\nIn the data set you provided the very first three rows (the “Initial…” rows) simply show the opening balances coming in from cash deposit, bank deposit, and allocation to fixed assets. (When preparing a cash‐flow statement the “initial” amounts are usually treated as beginning balances; only later on do “investment” transactions (that is, any additional purchase or sale of fixed assets) count in the investing section.) \n\nAll subsequent transactions in the list are “Purchase”, “Expense”, “Sale”, “Depreciation”, “Interest” and so on. Although many “Purchase” transactions represent cash‐payments, they are for purchasing inventory (goods to be sold) rather than for acquiring long‑term (fixed) assets. (Only acquisitions of fixed assets—such as a “Fixed Assets Purchase” would be an investing cash flow.)\n\nIn the data provided there is no transaction (apart from the “Initial…” row) that involves an acquisition or sale of a fixed asset. (In our earlier example the only investing cash flow was the “FixedAsset20231231001” row—but note that in that case the “Fixed Assets” recorded on issue with the “Initial…” row is not included in the investing section.) \n\nThus, in the transactions listed here there are no non‑initial investing transactions. Therefore, the sum of cash inflows and outflows from investing activities is 0.0.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.0\"\n  }\n}",
