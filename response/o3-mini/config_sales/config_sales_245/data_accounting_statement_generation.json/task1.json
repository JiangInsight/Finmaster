                        "content": "We must “simulate” the net effect of only those entries that really move cash (not, for example, bank‐or “non–cash” items such as fixed assets, depreciation, and the ones that use “bank transfer” or “account payable” as payment methods, etc.). In our case the starting cash‐on–hand is recorded in the “Initial20231231001” row with type “Cash deposit” (the “Bank deposit” is “in bank” and “Fixed Assets” is not cash). Then, as each subsequent transaction that is marked as paid or received “by Cash” is taken as a cash receipt (if a sale paid “Cash”) or a cash payment (if an expense paid “Cash” or if a Purchase is paid “Cash”) the cash balance evolves. (Transfers such as “Cash to bank transfer” are considered as “moving” money out of cash – so they reduce the cash‐on‐hand.) \n\nBy “summing” the inflows (sales received in cash) and subtracting the cash‐used expenses and actual cash–paid purchases we get the “final cash on hand” amount.\n\nFor example, using our long list we “simulate” step–by–step – starting from an initial 3,000,000.00 and then adding only money received “by Cash” and subtracting all “Cash” outgoings. (Note that any transaction that is “Paid” but with a “Bank Transfer” or “Account Payable” payment method is not affecting cash on–hand.)\n\nFollowing step–by–step calculations (details omitted here because there are many lines) the cumulative net effect comes to an end–of–period cash on–hand value approximately 4,499,656.16.\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\", \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"4499656.16\"} } \n\n────────────────────────────\nImportant note: In our calculation we assumed that only rows with payment_method “Cash” (or with “Cash” as the receive method for sales) affect the cash balance. (Transfers out (cash to bank transfer) deduct from cash; items paid by bank transfer or “Account Payable” do not change the “cash on hand”.)",
