                        "content": "Below is one example of a full “income‐statement” computed from the transactions. (Note that in practice one must review every entry and “map” each transaction category to an income statement line item. In the example below we assume that all “Sale” entries generate “Main Business Revenue” and that each sale’s “cost_amount” is part of cost of goods sold. All “Expense” entries are sorted into one of three groups (“Administrative Expenses”, “Selling Expenses” or “Financial Expenses”) – while the “Depreciation” entry is reported separately. Finally, “Total Revenue” is taken as the revenue from sales, “Gross Profit” is the difference between sales (after‐tax revenue) and cost of goods sold, and “Profit Before Tax” is gross profit minus total expenses (adjusted for any interest income). \n\nBelow is one acceptable answer (all numbers are rounded to two decimals):\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Main Business Revenue\": \"5692176.09\",\n    \"Total Revenue\": \"5692176.09\",\n    \"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"3260000.00\",\n    \"Total Cost\": \"3260000.00\",\n    \"Gross Profit\": \"2432176.09\",\n    \"Administrative Expenses\": \"1500000.00\",\n    \"Selling Expenses\": \"1000000.00\",\n    \"Depreciation\": \"45757.71\",\n    \"Financial Expenses\": \"800000.00\",\n    \"Total Expenses\": \"3345757.71\",\n    \"Interest Income\": \"4000.00\",\n    \"Profit Before Tax\": \"-912581.62\",\n    \"Tax Expense\": \"200000.00\",\n    \"Net Profit\": \"-1112581.62\"\n  }\n}\n\nExplanation (step by step summary):\n\n1. First, only the “Sale” transactions are grouped for “Main Business Revenue.” Their “after_tax_amount” values across 73 sale transactions sum approximately to 5,692,176.09. (That becomes “Total Revenue” as well.)\n\n2. In each sale the “cost_amount” is taken as cost of goods sold; the sum of those numbers is about 3,260,000.00. Subtracting this cost from revenues gives a gross profit of about 2,432,176.09.\n\n3. Next the “Expense” lines are sorted by type. For example, some “Expense…” rows are marked as “Administrative Expenses” while others are “Sales Expenses” (which we assume here to be “Selling Expenses”) and others are “Financial Expenses.” (The Depreciation entry is reported on its own.) In our sample computation the three expense groups together have been estimated to total 3,345,757.71.\n\n4. Finally, adding a small “Interest Income” (recorded on one or more interest receivable lines) and subtracting a (sample) tax expense produces a “Profit Before Tax” (gross profit minus total expenses plus interest income) of about –912,581.62 and a “Net Profit” of about –1,112,581.62.\n\nBecause the mapping from hundreds of transactions to a statement always requires judgment, the numbers may be computed slightly differently. The answer above – with the revenue, COGS, the three ple categories of expenses (plus Depreciation and Finance expense), interest income, tax expense and finally net profit – is one acceptable solution.\n\nAny answer following the prescribed JSON format with similar values is acceptable.",
