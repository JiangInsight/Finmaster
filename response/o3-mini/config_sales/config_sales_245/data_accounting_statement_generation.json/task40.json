                        "content": "We can “build” the ending inventory by tracking the inventory‐items bought (via Purchase transactions) and “using up” inventory as sales occur (using the “cost_amount” given on Sale transactions). In effect, if you “start” with zero inventory, then your ending inventory is\n\n  Ending inventory = (Total purchases cost) – (Total cost of goods sold)\n\nBecause an increase in inventory consumes cash, the cash flow “item” is shown as a negative (i.e. “use of cash”).\n\nStep‑by‑step:\n\n1. Look at each Purchase row and add its “amount” (which represents the cost spent on buying the inventory item). In our problem the following Purchase transactions are present (with their “amount” values):\n  • Purchase20231231001: 200,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231002: 500,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231003: 70,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231004: 100,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231005: 35,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231006: 200,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231007: 180,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231008: 30,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231009: 50,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231010: 140,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231011: 100,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231012: 35,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231013: 45,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231014: 400,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231015: 120,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231016: 200,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231017: 450,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231018: 90,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231019: 15,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231020: 30,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231021: 160,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231022: 350,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231023: 35,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231024: 100,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231025: 450,000.00 \n  • Purchase20231231026: 140,000.00 \n  \nWhen you add all these together the total purchases cost equals 4,225,000.00.\n\n2. Next, add together the “cost_amount” values from each Sale row. (Each sale “uses” up inventory; the “cost_amount” is the cost of that sale’s inventory.) When you go through the many Sale rows in the table the sum of all cost_amount entries comes to 3,260,000.00.\n\n3. Thus, if we had no beginning inventory the “ending inventory” is\n\n  Ending inventory = 4,225,000.00 – 3,260,000.00 = 965,000.00\n\nIn a cash flow statement an increase in inventory is a cash “use” (it “ties up” cash), so it appears as a negative amount. Therefore, the change to be reported is –965,000.00.\n\nWe can now state the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n      \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-965000.00\"\n  }\n}",
