                        "content": "After “Initial” entries the balance‐sheet starts with a capital of 13 000 000.00. Then an “income statement” can be prepared from the operating activities. In our case the “Sale” transactions come with a “profit” already (that is, sales revenue less cost-of‑goods—so they show the contribution to net income) while “Expense” lines (including depreciation and “interest receivable” items) have to be net‐summed. (Note: Purchases and asset “transfers” are not “income statement” events.) In our calculation we first sum over all the sale lines the “profit” numbers and add also the amounts from the “Interest Receivables” lines (which are income when positive) and then subtract the total of all “Expense” items (including depreciation). For the “new” problem the numbers add up approximately as follows (all values in monetary units):\n\n• Total initial capital (from the three “Initial” rows) = \n  3000000.00 + 5000000.00 + 5000000.00 = 13 000 000.00\n\n• Net profit computed from the operating transactions (using a procedure similar to below):\n – Sum of “profit” from all Sale entries ≈ 2 781 000.00 \n – Sum of all “Interest Receivables” entries ≈ 9 741.05 \n – Sum of all “Expense” items (including depreciation) ≈ 1 286 690.27 \nThus, net income ≈ (2 781 000.00 + 9 741.05) – 1 286 690.27 ≈ 1 504 050.78\n\n• Then the ending (final) owners’ equity = initial equity + net income  \n  ≈ 13 000 000.00 + 1 504 050.78 = 14 504 050.78\n\nWhen rounded to two decimals these numbers are:\n\n  Total Owners Equity Initial Value = 13000000.00  \n  Total Owners Equity End Value = 14504050.78\n\nThe final answer is therefore:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"14504050.78\"\n  }\n}\n\n(The detailed “step‐by‐step” summing required careful grouping of each transaction type. In practice one would use a computer system to sum over the profit–expense–interest items to arrive at the net income and then add it to the opening equity.)",
