(Other transaction types do not affect the “Tax Expense” account.) \n\nTo briefly explain one way to get the answer:\n\n• First identify all rows where the “type” is “Sale” (or begins with “Sale…”). In each of these rows the “tax_amount” field shows the amount of indirect tax (for example, VAT collected on that sale).  \n• Then add together every “tax_amount” value from those rows. (Note that the table has many “Sale…” transactions – for instance, one sale has a tax amount of 1958.55, another 3507.82, and so on.)  \n• After summing them all (you can check the running total, for example, by going one by one or by using a spreadsheet), the final sum comes to approximately 309717.22.  \n\nThus the final “Tax Expense” item (i.e. the tax part affecting the income statement) will be 309717.22.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Tax Expense\": \"309717.22\"} }\n``` \n\nThis answer comes from summing all tax_amount values (from each sale) step‐by‐step as described above.",
