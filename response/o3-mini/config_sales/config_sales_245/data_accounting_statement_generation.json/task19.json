                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” the final “owners equity + liabilities” balance by “starting” from the very beginning and then “adding” the net “income” generated by operating transactions and “adding” the increase in unsatisfied payables (ie, purchases that stayed “unpaid”). (In an actual accounting system all the “Sales” – “Expense” items eventually “net‐off” to a “net income” which is added into owners’ equity; meanwhile, those purchases whose “Payment/receipt_status” are “Unpaid” generate a liability.) \n\nIn our (simplified) example the three initial “Initial20231231001” entries sum to\n\n  3,000,000 (cash deposit) + 5,000,000 (bank deposit) + 5,000,000 (fixed assets) = 13,000,000.00\n\nThen, by “reading” the sale lines we note that many sales record a “profit” (which is the recognized net effect for that sale after subtracting its associated cost). When we add up all the “profit” numbers from each “Sale …” row we get an approximate total profit of about 2,740,764.34. (That is the sum of all the “profit”‐columns in all the sale rows.) \n\nAt the same time the “Expense” transactions (including operating “Sales Expenses”, “Administrative expenses”, “Financial Expenses” and also the recorded “Depreciation”) sum to roughly 1,243,089.34. (One may add the several dozens of expense lines; the grand total comes out on the order of 1.19–1.24 million.) Also, there is an “Interest Receivables” component (many such items appear) that – when added– yields about 10,051.66 in extra non–operating income. In other words, the net effect of all transactions is a “net income” of\n\n  Sales profit (≈2,740,764.34)\n   minus Expense (≈1,243,089.34)\n   plus Interest income (≈10,052)\n  ≈ 1,507,727\n\nThis “profit” then is “closed‐into” owners’ equity so that the “operating” change in equity is approximately\n\n  13,000,000.00 + 1,507,727.00 = 14,507,727.00\n\nMeanwhile, not all purchase transactions were “paid.” If you add the amounts on the “Purchase …” rows whose “payment/receipt_status” is “Unpaid” (by looking at the relevant purchase rows we see amounts of 35,000.00, 50,000.00, 35,000.00, 45,000.00, 400,000.00, 90,000.00, 30,000.00 and 140,000.00 – a total of 825,000.00) these represent a liability (an “Accounts Payable” balance) that is not “paid out” from cash. \n\nThus the final “Total Liabilities and Owners’ Equity” equals the final owners’ equity plus these unpaid purchase amounts:\n  14,507,727.00 + 825,000.00 = 15,332,727.00\n\nSo the answer is as follows:\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"15332727.00\"\n  }\n}\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nNote that the “step‐by‐step” calculation involves adding up the initial contributions, “closing‐in” all sale “profit” items (after subtracting the many expense entries) plus non–operating income, and then adding the unpaid purchase amounts which increase the liabilities. (In a real accounting system this would be done automatically by posting all entries into the general ledger.)",
