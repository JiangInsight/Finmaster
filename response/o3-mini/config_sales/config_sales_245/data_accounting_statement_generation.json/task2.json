                        "content": "We start by noticing that the “Initial” records give you the starting values. In our case only the initial “Bank deposit” record (with id “Initial20231231001” and type “Bank deposit”) shows the opening bank‐deposit balance of 5,000,000.00.\n\nThen we must “adjust” that initial figure by taking into account any transactions that use funds from the bank. In our data the only transactions that directly touch the bank account are those in which the “payment_method” is “Bank Transfer” (that is, money paid for a purchase by bank transfer). (Sales collected by “cash” or “account receivable” do not change the bank deposit.) Reviewing the purchase transactions we find the following records (with their amounts in the “amount” field) and payment_method “Bank Transfer”: \n\n• Purchase20231231001 – 200,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231002 – 500,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231003 – 70,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231006 – 200,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231010 – 140,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231015 – 120,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231019 – 15,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231024 – 100,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231026 – 140,000.00  \n\nAdding these amounts gives a total “outflow” via bank transfer of:  \n  200,000 + 500,000 = 700,000  \n  700,000 + 70,000 = 770,000  \n  770,000 + 200,000 = 970,000  \n  970,000 + 140,000 = 1,110,000  \n  1,110,000 + 120,000 = 1,230,000  \n  1,230,000 + 15,000  = 1,245,000  \n  1,245,000 + 100,000 = 1,345,000  \n  1,345,000 + 140,000 = 1,485,000  \n\nSince these payments reduce the bank’s funds, we subtract the total outflow (1,485,000.00) from the opening bank deposit (5,000,000.00):\n\n  Final bank deposit = 5,000,000.00 – 1,485,000.00 = 3,515,000.00\n\nThus the bank deposits item in the balance sheet is as follows:\n\nInitial bank deposit: 5,000,000.00  \nFinal bank deposit: 3,515,000.00\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"3515000.00\"} }\n```",
