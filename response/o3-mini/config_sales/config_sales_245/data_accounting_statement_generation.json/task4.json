                        "content": "We must “build” the AR (Accounts Receivable) balance as of the start–end of the period. In our books the “Initial” (opening) entries do not involve any receivable–all “Initial20231231001” rows simply record cash, bank, fixed assets (with no mention of trade receivables). Then we “build” the receivable side by summing up (only) the sale‐transactions that were “on account,” i.e. those whose receive method is “Account Receviable” (note the spelling in our data) and that have not been “paid.” (Sales that received cash do not add to receivables.) \n\nStep‑by‑step, reading the table row by row the following Sale transactions have “Account Receviable” as receive_method and are unpaid:\n\n1. Sale20240102002 – Amount: 39,170.93  \n2. Sale20240103006 – Amount: 179,770.40  \n3. Sale20240104010 – Amount: 55,908.81  \n4. Sale20240105014 – Amount: 36,205.30  \n5. Sale20240107025 – Amount: 36,361.26  \n6. Sale20240108028 – Amount: 18,408.64  \n7. Sale20240110037 – Amount: 26,373.15  \n8. Sale20240113049 – Amount: 19,087.14  \n9.
