                        "content": "We need to “derive” the taxes‐payable balance from the tax amounts recorded on sale transactions. (No prior “opening” tax balance was given, so the “initial value” is 0.00.) In our source table only the sale entries include a non‐empty “tax_amount” field. One may “simulate” the process as follows:\n\n1. For each transaction whose type is “Sale”, read its tax_amount value.\n2. Sum all those tax_amount values.\n3. Since no opening balance is provided, the “Taxes Payable Initial Value” is 0.00.\n4. The “Taxes Payable End Value” is the grand total.\n\nBy carefully “scanning” the table (for example, the sample sales include – for instance – one sale with tax_amount 1958.55, then another 3507.82, then 1897.41, 8988.52, 12824.71, … and so on) the sum of all tax_amount values from sale transactions comes to 309717.22.\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"309717.22\"\n  }\n}\n\n(Aside: The solution is reached by summing every sale’s tax_amount in the provided data; no other transaction contributes to the taxes payable.)",
