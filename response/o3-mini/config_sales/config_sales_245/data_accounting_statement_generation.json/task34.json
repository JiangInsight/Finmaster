In our listing the only “balance‐sheet” entries are the initial deposits, fixed‐assets and purchases. (They “set up” assets and inventory but do not enter the “profit” calculation.) Only the following kinds of entries contribute to the “profit” (or loss) calculation:\n \n• All “Sale” rows contribute their “profit” value (which has been computed, for example, by subtracting the cost of goods sold from the “after tax” sale proceeds).\n \n• All “Expense” rows (which include “Sales Expenses”, “Administrative Expenses”, “Financial Expenses”, etc.) contribute a cost (an outflow) that – when summed – must be deducted.\n \n• The “Depreciation” rows must also be subtracted.\n \n• The “Interest Receivables” rows are income (even though sometimes they are “unpaid”) and they are added.\n \nOnce we “ignore” the initial/purchase/transfer lines, we can compute a net “operating” result by adding up the sale‐profit items plus interest income and subtracting the sum of all expense–type flows plus depreciation.\n \nBelow is one step‐by‐step summary (all amounts are “amount” numbers as given in the table):\n \n1. Sum of all sale “profit” values (the last column on rows whose type is “Sale”):\n  S ≈ 2,783,342.69\n \n2. Sum of all “Expense” entries (for every row whose type begins with “Expense” – including Sales, Administrative and Financial Expenses):\n  E ≈ 1,276,911.79\n \n3. Add the single “Depreciation” row:\n  D = 45,757.71\n \n4. Sum of all “Interest Receivables” rows (all positive amounts are “additional income”):\n  I ≈ 10,066.31\n \nThe “income‐statement net profit” is then computed as follows:\n \n  Net Profit = (Sales profit S + Interest income I) – (Expenses E + Depreciation D)\n       ≈ (2,783,342.69 + 10,066.31) – (1,276,911.79 + 45,757.71)\n       ≈ 2,793,409.00 – 1,322,669.50\n       ≈ 1,470,739.50\n \nThus, the final computed net profit is about 1,470,739.50.\n \nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '1470739.50'}}",
