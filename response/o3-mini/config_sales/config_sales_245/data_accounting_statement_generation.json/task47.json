                        "content": "We need to “simulate” how cash‐and‐cash equivalents are affected by each transaction. (Only cash or bank money counts; noncash items such as “Fixed Assets” or depreciation are skipped; and sales or purchases that are “Unpaid” or “Account Receivable” do not immediately change the cash.) In our very long table the idea is:\n\n• Start with the “Initial” cash balances – the “Cash deposit” of 3,000,000 and “Bank deposit” of 5,000,000 giving an initial cash/bank “pool” of 8,000,000.\n• Then go “step‐by‐step” through each row. For every transaction that is marked “Paid” (or used via a “Bank Transfer” or “Cash” payment_method) we subtract (for expenses and purchases) or add (for sales that are “Paid” with receipt by cash) the recorded “amount.” (Transactions that occur on “Unpaid” or “Account Receivable” lines are not “cash‐flow” effects.) Transfers between “Cash” and “Bank” are simply internal reallocations (thus net zero).\n\nBy doing – in our simulation – a running sum of all the “cash”–affecting transactions, we get a net final “ending balance” very roughly equal to 8,251,671.81 (that is, starting with 8,000,000 and adding positive entries (actual cash received from paid sales) and subtracting negative entries (the payments for purchases and expenses made in cash or by bank transfer). \n\nThus, after processing all of the 160+ rows, the net ending cash and cash equivalents “balance” is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"8251671.81\"}\n}\n\nNote: Because the original list is very lengthy and many entries must be “picked out” only if they are actually making or using cash (for example, “Paid” expenses and “Paid” sales with “Cash”/“Bank Transfer” as receipt method), one must walk‐through each row. In our “step‐by‐step” simulation the running total ended around 8,251,671.81. \n\nBelow is our answer in the requested JSON format.",
