In our data the only rows that represent expenses are the ones whose “type” begins with “Expense” (for example: “Sales Expenses”, “Administrative Expenses”, “Financial Expenses”, etc.) plus the “Depreciation” row (which is an expense item on the income statement). (We ignore “Purchase”, “Sale”, “Initial…” and “Transfer” transactions and also skip “Interest Receivables” because these do not belong on the expense side.) \n\nThen we simply sum the “amount” column for every expense row (and include the “Depreciation” row as well).
