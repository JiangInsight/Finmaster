                        "content": "We need to “extract” the portion of the transactions that lead to an unpaid liability. In our case only purchase transactions that were not “Paid” and were processed using the “Account Payable” payment method affect the Accounts Payable balance.\n\nStep 1. The “Initial” rows do not include any payable entry so we assume the beginning balance is zero.\n\nStep 2. We scan the “Purchase” transactions that list a payment method of “Account Payable” (and – in most cases – are “Unpaid”). In our data the following purchase records qualify:\n\n• Purchase20231231005 – Amount = 35,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231009 – Amount = 50,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231012 – Amount = 35,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231013 – Amount = 45,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231014 – Amount = 400,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231018 – Amount = 90,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231020 – Amount = 30,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231026 – Amount = 140,000.0\n\nStep 3. We add these amounts:\n  35,000 + 50,000 = 85,000  \n  85,000 + 35,000 = 120,000  \n  120,000 + 45,000 = 165,000  \n  165,000 + 400,000 = 565,000  \n  565,000 + 90,000 = 655,000  \n  655,000 + 30,000 = 685,000  \n  685,000 + 140,000 = 825,000\n\nSo, the ending balance of Accounts Payable is 825,000.\n\nThus the answer is as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"825000.00\"} }\n```",
