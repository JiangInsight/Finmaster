Identify the three items based on the instructions and provided financial statements:\n• From the Balance Sheet, we look for the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares, which is provided as \"Paid-in Capital\". Its end value is 13000000.00.\n• From the Income Statement, we need the profit or loss before deducting tax expense. The related line item is \"Profit Before Tax\", whose value is 1478526.85.\n• From the Cash Flow Statement, we look for the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit. The related line item is \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with a value of 545000.00.\n\nStep 2. Combine the three values in the required order (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value1\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"value2\": \"1478526.85\",\n    \"value3\": \"545000.00\"\n  }\n}",
