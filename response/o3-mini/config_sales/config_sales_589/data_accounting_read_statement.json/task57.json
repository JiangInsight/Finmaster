This is typically the \"Accounts Payable\" (i.e., the liabilities due to purchases on credit).\n\nStep 2: In the cash flow statement, the line \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" shows the amount by which accounts payable have increased during the period. For this problem, the value under that line is 545000.00.\n\nStep 3: This matches the increase in the accounts payable seen in the balance sheet.\n\nThus, the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit is 545000.00.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": { \"value\": \"545000.00\" }\n}",
