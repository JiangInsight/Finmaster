The problem asks us to extract two specific values:\n   • The “costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers.” In the provided example, this corresponds to the \"Selling Expenses\" line item in the Income Statement.\n   • The “cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.” In the provided example, this corresponds to the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" line item in the Cash Flow Statement.\n2. Looking at the provided input for the Income Statement, we identify the \"Selling Expenses\" line item. Its value is 555218.93.\n3. Next, in the Cash Flow Statement, we identify the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" line item. Its value is 106218.20.\n4. Thus, our solution is:\n   • value1 = 555218.93 (from the Income Statement)\n   • value2 = 106218.20 (from the Cash Flow Statement)\n\nTherefore, the final answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '555218.93', 'value2': '106218.20'} }",
