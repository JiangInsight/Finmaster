                        "content": "We start by extracting the key numbers from the three statements (using the “End_amount” figures):\n\n1. From the Balance Sheet (2024-01-28):\n • Total Current Assets = 9,963,057.95  \n • Total Current Liabilities = 829,755.77  \n • Total Assets = 15,023,526.85  \n • Total Liabilities = (Total Assets – Total Owner's Equity) = 15,023,526.85 – 14,193,771.08 = 829,755.77  \n\n2. From the Cash Flow Statement:\n • Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –224,133.22  \n • Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = –106,218.20  \n • (The “Net Increase” in cash is –330,351.42, which is the sum of the above.)  \n\n3. From the Income Statement:\n • Gross Profit = 2,610,115.02  \n • Total Revenue = 5,695,115.02  \n • Net Profit = 1,193,771.08  \n\n4. From the Balance Sheet “Cash” items (for liquidity):\n • Cash on Hand = 3,730,866.78  \n • Bank Deposits = 3,938,781.80  \n • Combined Cash = 3,730,866.78 + 3,938,781.80 = 7,669,648.58\n\nNow, we compute each indicator step by step:\n\nA. Current Ratio  \n Formula: Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \n = 9,963,057.95 / 829,755.77 ≈ 12.01\n\nB. Gross Profit Margin  \n Formula: Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100  \n = (2,610,115.02 / 5,695,115.02) × 100 ≈ 45.80%\n\nC. Debt to Asset Ratio  \n Formula: Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets  \n = 829,755.77 / 15,023,526.85 ≈ 0.0552, which rounds to approximately 0.06\n\nD. Net Profit Margin  \n Formula: Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100  \n = (1,193,771.08 / 5,695,115.02) × 100 ≈ 20.95%\n\nE. Cash to Current Debt Ratio  \n Formula: Cash to Current Debt Ratio = (Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits) / Total Current Liabilities  \n = 7,669,648.58 / 829,755.77 ≈ 9.25\n\nF. Free Cash Flow (FCF)  \n Definition used here: FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  \n = –224,133.22 + (–106,218.20) = –330,351.42\n\nG. Return on Assets (ROA)  \n Formula: ROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) × 100  \n = (1,193,771.08 / 15,023,526.85) × 100 ≈ 7.94%\n\nThus, the solution in the required JSON format is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"12.01\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"45.80%\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.06\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"20.95%\",\n    \"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"9.25\",\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-330351.42\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"7.94%\"\n  }\n}",
