                        "content": "We start by identifying the needed data from the provided statements.\n\nStep 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio \n• Formula: Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities  \n• From the cash‐flow statement, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –224,133.22  \n• From the balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 545,000.00 + 284,755.77 = 829,755.77  \n• Calculation: –224,133.22 / 829,755.77 ≈ –0.27\n\nStep 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \n• Often defined in this context as: Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt  \n• In the absence of separate long–term debt, we take Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 829,755.77  \n• Calculation: –224,133.22 / 829,755.77 ≈ –0.27\n\nStep 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio  \n• Formula: Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  \n• Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) from the income statement = 3,085,000.00  \n• Inventories: Since the beginning inventory is 0.00 and the ending inventory is 720,000.00,  \n  Average Inventory = (0.00 + 720,000.00) / 2 = 360,000.00  \n• Calculation: 3,085,000.00 / 360,000.00 ≈ 8.57\n\nStep 4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n• Formula: Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Owner's Equity  \n• Total Debt (again, here using current liabilities) = 829,755.77  \n• Total Owner’s Equity from balance sheet = 14,193,771.08  \n• Calculation: 829,755.77 / 14,193,771.08 ≈ 0.06\n\nStep 5. Quick Ratio  \n• Formula: Quick Ratio = (Total Current Assets – Inventory) / Total Current Liabilities  \n• Total Current Assets = 9,963,057.95 and Inventory = 720,000.00  \n  Quick assets = 9,963,057.95 – 720,000.00 = 9,243,057.95  \n• Calculation: 9,243,057.95 / 829,755.77 ≈ 11.14\n\nStep 6. Current Ratio  \n• Formula: Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \n• Calculation: 9,963,057.95 / 829,755.77 ≈ 12.01\n\nThus, the final answers are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.27\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.27\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"8.57\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.06\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"11.14\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"12.01\"\n  }\n}",
