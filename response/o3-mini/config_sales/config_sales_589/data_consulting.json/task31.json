                        "content": "Step 1: Calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio.\n• Formula: Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Main Business Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable\n• From the balance sheet, Accounts Receivable:\n  Initial = 0.00  End = 1,562,598.26\n• Average Accounts Receivable = (0.00 + 1,562,598.26) / 2 = 781,299.13\n• Main Business Revenue from the income statement = 5,695,115.02\n• Therefore, Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 5,695,115.02 / 781,299.13 ≈ 7.29\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Operating Cash Flow ratio (which is the operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio).\n• Formula: Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n• From the cash flow statement, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –224,133.22\n• From the balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities (at period end) = 829,755.77\n• Operating Cash Flow Ratio = –224,133.22 / 829,755.77 ≈ –0.27\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Total Asset Turnover Ratio.\n• Formula: Total Asset Turnover Ratio = Main Business Revenue / Average Total Assets\n• From the balance sheet, Total Assets:\n  Initial = 13,000,000.00  End = 15,023,526.85\n• Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 15,023,526.85) / 2 = 14,011,763.43\n• Main Business Revenue = 5,695,115.02\n• Total Asset Turnover Ratio = 5,695,115.02 / 14,011,763.43 ≈ 0.41\n\nStep 4: Calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio.\n• Formula: Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity\n• In the balance sheet, the only liabilities provided are the current liabilities. (No non‐current liabilities are separately listed, so we use Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities.)\n  Total Liabilities (End) = 829,755.77\n  Total Owner’s Equity (End) = 14,193,771.08\n• Debt to Equity Ratio = 829,755.77 / 14,193,771.08 ≈ 0.0585, which rounds to 0.06\n\nThus, the ratios are:\n• Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio ≈ 7.29  \n• Operating Cash Flow Ratio (and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio) ≈ –0.27  \n• Total Asset Turnover Ratio ≈ 0.41  \n• Debt to Equity Ratio ≈ 0.06\n\nThe final answer is provided in the JSON format below.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"7.29\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-0.27\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.27\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.41\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.06\"\n  }\n}",
