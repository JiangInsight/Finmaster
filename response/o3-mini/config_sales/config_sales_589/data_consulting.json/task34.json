                        "content": "We first extract the necessary end‐of‐period figures from the balance sheet and income statement (all “End_amount” values dated 2024‑01‑28):\n\n• Current Assets (ended): \n – Cash on Hand = 3,730,866.78  \n – Bank Deposits = 3,938,781.80  \n – Interest Receivable = 10,811.11  \n – Accounts Receivable = 1,562,598.26  \n – Inventory = 720,000.00  \n Total Current Assets is given as 9,963,057.95  \n\n• Total Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 545,000.00 + 284,755.77 = 829,755.77  \n\n• Total Assets = 15,023,526.85  \n\n• Owner’s Equity (End) = 14,193,771.08  \n Initial Owner’s Equity (from balance sheet initial) = Paid-in Capital + (initial Retained Earnings) = 13,000,000.00 + 0 = 13,000,000.00  \n ⇒ Average Owner’s Equity = (13,000,000.00 + 14,193,771.08) / 2 ≈ 13,596,885.54  \n\n• Operating cash flow (from Cash Flow Statement) = –224,133.22  \n\n• Income Statement figures:  \n – Main Business Revenue = 5,695,115.02  \n – Net Profit = 1,193,771.08  \n\n• Accounts Receivable:  \n Initial = 0.00, End = 1,562,598.26  \n ⇒ Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 1,562,598.26) / 2 = 781,299.13\n\nNow we calculate each ratio:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n = (Operating Cash Flow) / (Current Liabilities)  \n = (–224,133.22) / (829,755.77)  \n ≈ –0.27\n\n2. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n Here, “Debt” is taken as the total current liabilities (since there are no non‐current liabilities given).  \n = (Current Liabilities) / (Owner’s Equity at End)  \n = 829,755.77 / 14,193,771.08  \n ≈ 0.06\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n = (Revenue) / (Total Assets)  \n = 5,695,115.02 / 15,023,526.85  \n ≈ 0.38\n\n4. Quick Ratio  \n Quick Assets = Current Assets – Inventory  \n  = 9,963,057.95 – 720,000.00  \n  = 9,243,057.95  \n Then,  \n Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities  \n ≈ 9,243,057.95 / 829,755.77  \n ≈ 11.14\n\n5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n (This is the same as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio here.)  \n ≈ –0.27\n\n6. Return on Equity (ROE)  \n Using the net profit over average owner’s equity:  \n = (Net Profit) / (Average Owner’s Equity)  \n = 1,193,771.08 / 13,596,885.54  \n ≈ 0.0878 or 8.78%\n\n7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n = (Revenue) / (Average Accounts Receivable)  \n = 5,695,115.02 / 781,299.13  \n ≈ 7.29\n\nThus, the solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.27\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.06\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.38\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"11.14\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.27\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"8.78%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"7.29\"\n  }\n}",
