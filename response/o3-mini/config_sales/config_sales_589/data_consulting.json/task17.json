In the provided example, the ratio was computed as:\n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities.\nFor the example, the debt (i.e. total current liabilities) was the sum of Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable.\n\nStep 2: For our problem, the balance sheet shows:\n  Accounts Payable = 545000.00  \n  Taxes Payable = 284755.77  \nThus, Total Current Liabilities = 545000.00 + 284755.77 = 829755.77\n\nStep 3: From the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is given as –224133.22.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:\n  Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Current Liabilities)\n    = –224133.22 / 829755.77 \n    ≈ –0.27\n\nThus, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is –0.27.\n\nThe final answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.27'} }",
