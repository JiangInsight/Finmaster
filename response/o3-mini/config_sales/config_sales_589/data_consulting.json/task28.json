                        "content": "We first extract the three pieces of information needed from the provided schedules.\n\n1. Debt to Asset Ratio  \n • Total Liabilities: From the balance sheet, the only liabilities given are the “Accounts Payable” and “Taxes Payable.” Their End_amount values are  \n  Accounts Payable = 545000.00  \n  Taxes Payable = 284755.77  \n • Therefore, Total Liabilities = 545000.00 + 284755.77 = 829755.77  \n • Total Assets (End_amount) = 15023526.85  \n • Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets = 829755.77 / 15023526.85 ≈ 0.0552  \n • Rounding to two decimal places, we report this ratio as 0.06.\n\n2. Gross Profit Margin  \n • From the income statement,  \n  Gross Profit = 2610115.02  \n  Total Revenue = 5695115.02  \n • Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100  \n  = (2610115.02 / 5695115.02) × 100 ≈ 45.82%  \n • We express the result as “45.82%.”\n\n3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n • The Operating Cash Flow Ratio is computed using the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities divided by Total Current Liabilities.  \n • From the cash flow statement,  \n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –224133.22  \n • From the balance sheet,  \n  Total Current Liabilities = 829755.77  \n • Operating Cash Flow Ratio = –224133.22 / 829755.77 ≈ –0.2701  \n • Rounding to two decimals, we report this as –0.27.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.06\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"45.82%\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.27\"\n  }\n}",
