The balance sheet shows “Total Current Liabilities” = 829755.77.\n• Total Owner’s Equity: Provided as 14193771.08.\n• Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity = 829755.77 / 14193771.08 ≈ 0.0585, which rounded to two decimals is 0.06.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Net Profit Margin.\n• Net Profit: From the income statement, Net Profit = 1193771.08.\n• Total Revenue: Provided as 5695115.02.\n• Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100 = (1193771.08 / 5695115.02) × 100 ≈ 20.96%.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n• Operating Cash Flow: From the cash flow statement, “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities” = -224133.22.\n• Total Current Liabilities: From the balance sheet = 829755.77.\n• Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Current Liabilities = -224133.22 / 829755.77 ≈ -0.2702, which rounded to two decimals is -0.27.\n\nThus, the solution in the specified JSON format is:\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.06\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"20.96%\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.27\"\n  }\n}",
