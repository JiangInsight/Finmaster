(Only rows whose “type” value is “Sales Expenses” are included.)\n\nBelow is a brief step‐by‐step outline of one way to solve this:\n 1. Go through each transaction record.\n 2. When the “type” equals “Sales Expenses” add its “amount” value.\n 3. Sum all those amounts.\n\nFor example, in one part of the data you see rows like:\n • Expense20240101001 “Sales Expenses” 24861.73  \n • Expense20240101001 “Sales Expenses” 16439.23  \n • Expense20240102001 “Sales Expenses” 3170.38  \n • … etc.\nBy stepping through each “Sales Expenses” row and adding its amount you obtain the final total.\n\nAfter carefully accumulating every “Sales Expenses” transaction in the (long) list, the computed total is 555218.93.\n\nThus, the final “Selling Expenses” item (which is used in the income statement) is 555218.93.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is:\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Selling Expenses': '555218.93'}}",
