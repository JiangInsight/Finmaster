We first identified and “collected” the revenue from all “Sale” transactions – summing the “amount” column from those rows gave about 6,164,344.07. (This figure is used both as the Main Business Revenue and Total Revenue.)\n\n2. The cost of goods sold (COGS) was taken from the “cost_amount” values provided on the sale rows; the sum came to 2,455,000.00. (We assume – as in the sample problem – that no additional allocations from purchase‐side transactions appear on the income statement.)\n\n3. Gross profit is revenue less COGS = 6,164,344.07 – 2,455,000.00 = 3,709,344.07.\n\n4. All “Expense” transactions were grouped by their sub–category. The “Administrative Expenses” summed to approximately 577,442.88 while the “Selling Expenses” (i.e. the Sales Expenses) added up to about 523,489.25. Depreciation was given as 45,749.30 and “Financial Expenses” totaled about 114,016.33. Their overall sum (the Total Expenses) is about 1,260,697.76.\n\n5. The “Interest Receivables” rows (taken as Interest Income) sum to about 10,480.97.\n\n6. Profit before tax is computed as Gross Profit + Interest Income – Total Expenses = 3,709,344.07 + 10,480.97 – 1,260,697.76 = 2,459,127.28.\n\n7. Assuming an effective income tax rate similar to the sample problem (roughly 19.75%), the tax expense is about 485,136.00. Subtracting tax gives a Net Profit of about 2,459,127.28 – 485,136.00 = 1,973,991.28.\n\nThe numbers have been rounded to two decimals as above.",
