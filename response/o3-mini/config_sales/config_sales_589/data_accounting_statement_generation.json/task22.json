                        "content": "We need to “build up” total revenue from our operating revenue sources. In this dataset almost all revenue comes from sales‐transactions (the “Sale…” rows) and (in addition) the “Interest Receivables” rows are reported as revenue. (Other transaction types – purchase, expenses, and fixed‑asset issues – do not affect sales revenue.) \n\nTo explain briefly what we did, note that each “Sale…” row contains an “after_tax_amount” value (which – in an income statement – is the revenue recognized from that sale) and each “Interest…” row (of type “Interest Receivables”) shows an amount that is earned although not yet paid. (In our sample example these two groups are added to produce the “Total Revenue”.) \n\nStep 1. We went through the data and extracted all rows whose type begins with “Sale”. There were 76 “Sale…” rows. We then summed the “after_tax_amount” for each row. (For example, one sale had 82046.15, the next 35745.06, then 49585.70, etc.) When we summed these 76 amounts we obtained approximately 5,601,809.63.\n\nStep 2. Then we added the “Interest Receivables” amounts. In our dataset the “Interest…” row amounts were (in order) about 442.775 (five times), 433.875, then two values of roughly 424.42158 each, then a sequence of six rows with about 376.80658, then four rows with about 373.69158, two rows at 369.24158, one of 366.57158 and finally seven rows at about 350.55158. (All numbers are in the same monetary units.) Their sum came to roughly 10,811.11.\n\nStep 3. Adding the two parts together (sales revenue 5,601,809.63 + interest revenue 10,811.11) gives a final total revenue of about 5,612,620.74.\n\nThus, presenting the answer (rounded to 2 decimals) in the required JSON format we have:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Revenue\": \"5612620.74\"} }\n```",
