                        "content": "We must “build” the balance sheet liabilities by reading our transaction data. Typically, our “initial” transactions (those with an id starting with “Initial…”) are used to set up the beginning assets. In our list the three “Initial20231231001” rows create cash, bank, and fixed‑asset balances – none of which are liabilities. (No “initial liability” appears.) \n\nThen later in the period many “Purchase” transactions are recorded. In our data the ones that become liabilities are those purchases recorded as “Unpaid” (and whose payment method is “Account Payable”). (Other purchases paid by cash or bank transfer are settled immediately and do not leave a “liability” on the balance sheet.) \n\nScanning through the “Purchase” rows (note that each row is dated 2023‑12‑31) we identify the following lines with “Unpaid” status and payment method “Account Payable”:\n\n1. Purchase20231231002: amount = 90,000.0  \n2. Purchase20231231003: amount = 30,000.0  \n3. Purchase20231231018: amount = 60,000.0  \n4. Purchase20231231024: amount = 200,000.0  \n5. Purchase20231231026: amount = 25,000.0  \n6. Purchase20231231027: amount = 140,000.0  \n\nAdding these up step‐by‐step:\n • 90,000 + 30,000 = 120,000  \n • 120,000 + 60,000 = 180,000  \n • 180,000 + 200,000 = 380,000  \n • 380,000 + 25,000 = 405,000  \n • 405,000 + 140,000 = 545,000  \n\nThus, by the end of the period the “liability” side of the balance sheet has accumulated 545,000.00 in unpaid purchase amounts.\n\nIn summary, since none of the initial entries represented liabilities, the Total Liabilities Initial Value is 0.00, and the sum of ongoing (unpaid) purchases gives an ending liability of 545000.00.\n\nThus, our answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"545000.00\"\n  }\n}",
