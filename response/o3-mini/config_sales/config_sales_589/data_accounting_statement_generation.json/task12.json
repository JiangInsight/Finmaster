                        "content": "We have to “build” the accounts payable balance by checking the transactions that are “Purchase” transactions whose payment has not been made by cash/bank (that is, they have a payment‐method of “Account Payable” and a “payment/receipt_status” of Unpaid). (Note that the “Initial” rows are only for assets – cash, bank, fixed assets – so they do not include any opening accounts payable liability; hence the initial AP is 0.00.)\n\nIn the new problem the purchase transactions are as follows (all dated 2023‑12‑31):\n\n1. Purchase20231231001 – 25,000.0 – Paid by Bank Transfer → not on AP.\n2. Purchase20231231002 – 90,000.0 – Unpaid with payment method “Account Payable” → +90,000.0\n3. Purchase20231231003 – 30,000.0 – Unpaid (“Account Payable”) → +30,000.0 \n4. Purchase20231231004 – 250,000.0 – Paid with Cash → ignore.\n5. Purchase20231231005 – 60,000.0 – Paid with Cash → ignore.\n6. Purchase20231231006 – 200,000.0 – Paid with Cash → ignore.\n7. Purchase20231231007 – 400,000.0 – Paid with Cash → ignore.\n8. Purchase20231231008 – 80,000.0 – Paid with Cash → ignore.\n9. Purchase20231231009 – 100,000.0 – Paid (Bank Transfer) → ignore.\n10. Purchase20231231010 – 35,000.0 – Paid → ignore.\n11. Purchase20231231011 – 500,000.0 – Paid → ignore.\n12. Purchase20231231012 – 15,000.0 – Paid → ignore.\n13. Purchase20231231013 – 90,000.0 – Paid → ignore.\n14. Purchase20231231014 – 20,000.0 – Paid → ignore.\n15. Purchase20231231015 – 100,000.0 – Paid → ignore.\n16. Purchase20231231016 – 140,000.0 – Paid → ignore.\n17. Purchase20231231017 – 35,000.0 – Paid → ignore.\n18. Purchase20231231018 – 60,000.0 – Unpaid (“Account Payable”) → +60,000.0\n19. Purchase20231231019 – 50,000.0 – Paid → ignore.\n20. Purchase20231231020 – 450,000.0 – Paid → ignore.\n21. Purchase20231231021 – 30,000.0 – Paid → ignore.\n22. Purchase20231231022 – 160,000.0 – Paid → ignore.\n23. Purchase20231231023 – 20,000.0 – Paid → ignore.\n24. Purchase20231231024 – 200,000.0 – Unpaid (“Account Payable”) → +200,000.0\n25. Purchase20231231025 – 50,000.0 – Paid → ignore.\n26. Purchase20231231026 – 25,000.0 – Unpaid (“Account Payable”) → +25,000.0\n27. Purchase20231231027 – 140,000.0 – Unpaid (“Account Payable”) → +140,000.0\n28. Purchase20231231028 – 450,000.0 – Paid → ignore.\n\nNow, summing up the amounts that add to AP:\n 90,000.0 + 30,000.0 = 120,000.0  \n + 60,000.0 = 180,000.0  \n + 200,000.0 = 380,000.0  \n + 25,000.0 = 405,000.0  \n + 140,000.0 = 545,000.0\n\nBecause no opening accounts payable liability is provided (the “Initial” entries list only assets), the beginning (initial) AP balance is 0.00, and after processing all AP–related purchase transactions the final accounts payable balance is 545,000.00.\n\nThus, we present the answer as follows:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \n    \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"545000.00\"\n  }\n}",
