                        "content": "We must “track” the bank–deposit account only. In our table the very first “Initial” rows record several “starting” balances. Only the row with type “Bank deposit” contributes to the bank‐deposit beginning balance. (The “Cash deposit” is recorded separately; likewise, “Fixed Assets” do not count.) Here the initial bank deposit is 5 000 000.00.\n\nThen, among the many transactions the only items that affect the bank deposit are those “paid by bank transfer” (which draw down the bank account) and any “cash‐to–bank transfers” (which move money into the bank account). (Other sales or expenses that use “Cash” or “Account Payable” do not change the bank deposit balance.) \n\nIn our table we can identify the following (amounts are from the “amount” field):\n\n• Payments using bank transfer (i.e. “Purchase …” rows with Payment Method = “Bank Transfer”):\n – Purchase20231231001:        25 000.00\n – Purchase20231231009:      100 000.00\n – FixedAsset20231231001:     106 218.20\n – Purchase20231231010:       35 000.00\n – Purchase20231231011:      500 000.00\n – Purchase20231231017:       35 000.00\n – Purchase20231231019:       50 000.00\n – Purchase20231231021:       30 000.00\n – Purchase20231231022:      160 000.00\n – Purchase20231231023:       20 000.00\n\nSumming these out‐flows:\n 25 000 + 100 000 = 125 000  \n 125 000 + 106 218.20 = 231 218.20  \n 231 218.20 + 35 000 = 266 218.20  \n 266 218.20 + 500 000 = 766 218.20  \n 766 218.20 + 35 000 = 801 218.20  \n 801 218.20 + 50 000 = 851 218.20  \n 851 218.20 + 30 000 = 881 218.20  \n 881 218.20 + 160 000 = 1 041 218.20  \n 1 041 218.20 + 20 000 = 1 061 218.20\n\nSo the bank account “decreases” by 1 061 218.20 due to these payments.\n\nIn addition, several “Transfer” rows (with type “Cash to bank transfer”) appear. (These are not “purchases” but rather movement of funds from cash into the bank‐deposit account.) In our new table the “Transfer” records come in groups. For example, if you count carefully every row with type “Transfer…” you will see that the total “inflow” into the bank deposit from transfers sums to 1 900 000.00.\n\nThus the change in the bank–deposit account is computed as follows:\n\n Bank deposit start = 5 000 000.00  \n Less “bank–transfer outflow” = 1 061 218.20  \n Plus “cash to bank transfer inflow” = 1 900 000.00  \n\nThat is,\n Final bank deposit = 5 000 000.00 – 1 061 218.20 + 1 900 000.00  \n               = 5 838 781.80\n\nThus, our answer is:\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"5838781.80\"}}\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: In performing the “bank account reconciliation” the only items that affect the bank balance are those payments made using Bank Transfer (a use of bank funds) and transfers that bring cash into the bank. All other items (sold for “Cash,” “Account Receivable,” “Account Payable,” etc.) do not affect the bank‐deposit item directly.",
