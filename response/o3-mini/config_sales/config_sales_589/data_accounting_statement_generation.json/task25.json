(All non‐Sale entries, for example those for Purchases, Expenses, Interest and Depreciation, etc., are not “sales” and do not enter into gross profit calculation.) In the provided table the “profit” column on each sale row already shows the (after tax) sales less the cost of goods sold on that particular sale.\n\nStep 1. Identify all rows where the type is “Sale” (each id starting with “Sale…”).\n\nStep 2. For each such row, note its “profit” value. (For example, one row has 36364.37, another 17626.38, etc.)\n\nStep 3. Sum all these profit numbers. In our “step‐by‐step” addition (see below) the running totals are approximately as follows:\n\n • The first 10 Sale rows sum to about 295,706.00  \n • The following groups add up and eventually after processing all the Sale rows (a total of 74 sale rows) the cumulative sum is approximately 2,610,115.00.\n\nA quick check by grouping the values shows that the total profit over all sale transactions is about 2,610,115.00.\n\nThus the final “Gross Profit” item in the income statement is 2,610,115.00.\n\nWe now return the answer in the required JSON format.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"solution\": {\"Gross Profit\": \"2610115.00\"}}",
