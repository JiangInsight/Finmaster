                        "content": "We need to “extract” only those transactions that increase (or create) a liability—that is, where we received goods or services on credit (not “Paid”) so that the company still owes money. In our data the “Initial” transactions are all asset‐type entries, so they do not create a liability balance. Then we must “look” at all Purchase entries and similar where the payment status is “Unpaid” (and often the payment_method is “Account Payable”). (Other entries such as Sales, Expenses – when Paid – do not “leave” a liability.) \n\nStep‑by‑step we review the Purchase rows:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001 (amount 25000.0) was “Paid” so no liability.\n2. Purchase20231231002 – Type “Purchase” with amount 90000.0 is marked “Unpaid” and the payment_method is “Account Payable.” This creates a current liability of 90,000.\n3. Purchase20231231003 – amount = 30000.0 is “Unpaid” (payment_method “Account Payable”) → add 30,000.\n4. Purchase20231231004 – was “Paid” so skip.\n5. Purchase20231231005 – “Paid.” \n6. Purchase20231231006 – “Paid.”\n7. Purchase20231231007 – “Paid.”\n8. Purchase20231231008 – “Paid.”\n9. Purchase20231231009 – “Paid.”\n10. Purchase20231231010 – “Paid.”\n11. Purchase20231231011 – “Paid.”\n12. Purchase20231231012 – “Paid.”\n13. Purchase20231231013 – “Paid.”\n14. Purchase20231231014 – “Paid.”\n15. Purchase20231231015 – “Paid.”\n16. Purchase20231231016 – “Paid.”\n17. Purchase20231231017 – “Paid.”\n18. Purchase20231231018 – amount = 60000.0 is “Paid”? (Check row 106: this row shows Unpaid with payment method “Account Payable”.) → add 60,000.\n19. Purchase20231231019 – “Paid.”\n20. Purchase20231231020 – “Paid.”\n21. Purchase20231231021 – “Paid.”\n22. Purchase20231231022 – “Paid.”\n23. Purchase20231231023 – “Paid.”\n24. Purchase20231231024 – amount = 250000.0 is marked “Paid” or “Unpaid”?  \n  Looking at the row “Purchase20231231004” we already saw 250000.0 was Paid.\n  Now later the next “Purchase” row with an id “Purchase20231231024” appears (row 175) with amount 200000.0 and payment status “Unpaid” (payment_method “Account Payable”). → add 200,000.\n25. Purchase20231231025 – “Paid.”\n26. Purchase20231231026 – amount = 25000.0 and payment status “Unpaid” → add 25,000.\n27. Purchase20231231027 – amount = 140000.0 and “Unpaid” → add 140,000.\n28. Purchase20231231028 – “Paid.”\n29. Purchase202312310? (rows 24–27 are the only ones with a status of Unpaid)\n\nThus the only “unpaid” (credit) Purchases are:\n • 90000.0  \n • 30000.0  \n • 60000.0  \n • 200000.0  \n • 25000.0  \n • 140000.0  \n\nThe sum becomes:\n 90000 + 30000 = 120000  \n 120000 + 60000 = 180000  \n 180000 + 200000 = 380000  \n 380000 + 25000 = 405000  \n 405000 + 140000 = 545000\n\nAlso, none of the other entries (Sales, Expenses, Depreciation, Interest Receivables, Fixed Asset purchases, or Transfer transactions) create a liability.\n \nSince the “initial” transactions (with id “Initial20231231001”) are deposits and fixed assets, there was no initial current liability – so the current liabilities at the start of the period were 0.00. \n\nThus the balance sheet “current liabilities” for the period end will include the outstanding unpaid Purchases totaling 545000.00.\n\nSo the answer will be:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"545000.00\"\n  }\n}",
