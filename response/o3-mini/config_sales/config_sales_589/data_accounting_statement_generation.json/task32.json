                        "content": "We can “build” an income‐statement from the “income side” (the revenues from selling goods and “other revenue” such as interest receivables) and “deduct” the “expenses” (the operating costs, depreciation and other outgoings). In our case the bulk of the revenue comes from the many “Sale” transactions – each of which already shows its “profit” (that is, sale–cost amounts). Also, the “Interest Receivables” (the ones with type “Interest Receivables”) are to be added while the “Expense” (including administrative, sales, financial and depreciation expenses) decrease the profit.\n\nOne acceptable approach is as follows:\n\n1. Sum up the “profit” fields from every Sale transaction. (In our data there are 78 Sale rows – when you add them all the total is roughly 2,688,344.07.)\n2. Then add the “Interest Receivables” amounts – there are several interest transactions totaling about 10,460.56.\n  – Thus the “total operating (and other) revenue” comes to about \n   2,688,344.07 + 10,460.56 ≈ 2,698,804.63.\n3. Next you subtract all expense‐side items. (Those “Expense” rows – sales expenses, administrative expenses, financial expenses as well as the depreciation – sum to about 1,142,398.)\n4. Thus, the “Profit before tax” equals\n   2,698,804.63 – 1,142,398 ≈ 1,556,406.63.\n\nFor example, one acceptable answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Profit Before Tax\": \"1556406.63\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote that because the table has many rows, one must carefully add each sale’s net “profit” and subtract the aggregated expense amounts (while adding back any income – as for interest receivables) to arrive at the final profit‐before‐tax number.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.",
