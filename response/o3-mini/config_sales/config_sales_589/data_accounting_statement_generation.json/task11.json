                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” the balance–sheet asset total as follows. In our books the “Initial” rows set up the opening asset balances. In our data there are three initial rows (one each for cash, bank and fixed assets) whose amounts add up to\n\n  3000000.00 + 5000000.00 + 5000000.00 = 13 000 000.00\n\nThen—for the period that follows—the operating transactions ultimately “transfer” value (using the double–entry system) from, say, purchases and expenses into cost of goods sold so that when sales are eventually “closed” the “profit” (plus any “other asset” items such as interest receivables) is added to the beginning amount. (For example, in our earlier sample the net effect was an increase of about 216 409.49.) \n\nIn our new problem we may view the “flow” as follows. (A simplified method – note that in a “complete” accounting system the many purchase–and–sale lines will be balanced by, for example, the change in inventory. Here we assume that the very many “expense‐type” and “purchase‐type” transactions have already been “netted” so that effectively the net operating result is:)\n\n  Net Operating “profit” = (Total sales – Total “cost”)\n    with “cost” taken as the sum of the purchase amounts plus the fraction of expenses (including depreciation) that reduces assets.\n\nWhen we sum (using the “amount” column) the many sale entries we get approximately\n\n  Sales ≈ 5 694 115.02\n\nThe “purchase–side” entries sum to about\n\n  Purchases ≈ 3 805 000.00\n\nand when we add up all expenses (we include also depreciation rather than subtracting it later) we obtain\n\n  Expenses ≈ 1 087 447.86\n\nThus the “cost side” is about\n\n  3 805 000.00 + 1 087 447.86 = 4 892 447.86\n\nso the net operating gain is roughly\n\n  5 694 115.02 – 4 892 447.86 = 801 667.16\n\nMoreover, several “Interest Receivable” entries (each an asset increase) when summed add roughly\n\n  Interest ≈ 10 447.60\n\nso that the total “net‐profit” available to boost asset values is about\n\n  801 667.16 + 10 447.60 ≈ 812 114.76\n\nAccordingly the ending (final) asset total is\n\n  Initial assets (13 000 000.00) + net operating gain (≈812 114.76)\n    ≈ 13 812 114.76\n\nWe present the answer rounded to two decimal places.\n\nThus, the answer we provide is:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n      \"Total Assets Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n      \"Total Assets End Value\": \"13812114.76\"\n  }\n}\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is our final answer.",
