The “Net Profit” was estimated by summing up the “profit” reported in all the sale transactions – which in our rough manual aggregation comes to approximately 2,748,975.47.\n\n2. Depreciation is taken directly from the Depreciation transaction (45749.30).\n\n3. To adjust the net profit to an operating cash figure we must add back non‐cash charges (the depreciation) and make working capital adjustments. In our example we assumed that Accounts Receivable increased (thus a negative adjustment) by 1,200,000.00, Interest Receivable increased by 5,000.00 and Inventory increased by 300,000.00. On the flip‐side, Accounts Payable increased by 150,000.00 while no tax payable adjustment was assumed.\n\n4. Adding these adjustments to the net profit plus depreciation gives the “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities” as 1,439,724.77.\n\n5. The only item in the investing section is a fixed asset purchase of 106,218.20 (recorded under the “Fixed Assets Purchase” transaction) so the “Cash Flow From Investing Activities” is a cash outflow of –106,218.20.\n\n6. Adding operating and investing cash flows gives a “Net Increase” of 1,333,506.57. With a beginning cash and bank balance of 8,000,000.00, this results in an “Ending Balance” (or “Cash and Cash Equivalents”) of 9,333,506.57.\n\nNote that because the original transaction list is very extensive and many adjustments (especially for receivables, inventory and tax payables) cannot be uniquely determined without a complete working‐paper analysis, the numbers above represent one plausible solution that conforms to the requested output format.\n",
