                        "content": "We can “close‐the books” by “rolling up” all income (the revenues – the cost and all other expenses) and by “adding” any balance–sheet “liability” that was created (for example, when a purchase is made “unpaid”). In our simplified treatment the idea is that the “initial” owners’ equity is the total of the “Initial” posting (the three lines for cash, bankand fixed assets) – 13 000 000 – and then (a) every sale transaction “generates profit” (the sale record shows a “profit” value) while every expense record (including depreciation) is separately recorded (and goes against profit) and (b) purchases that are “unpaid” are recorded as liabilities. (Other entries (for example, transfers) merely shift money between asset accounts.) \n \nIn our “Problem to Solve” the postings are as follows:\n • The three “Initial…” transactions total 3 000 000 + 5 000 000 + 5 000 000 = 13 000 000.00 – this gives the “Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value.”\n • Then – by “summing‐up” all of the “profit” values on the sale records we find an (aggregate) “sale profit” of roughly 2,610,105.02. (That is, the sale transactions – once the cost of goods is netted – would – if there were no extra expenses – have “generated” that many dollars in the income statement.) \n • In our many “Expense…” records we have spending on sales, on administration and on depreciation – by adding together all those “expense” amounts we get a total of about 1,096,651.09.\n • Thus the net “operating profit” (net income) from the sales is \n  2,610,105.02 – 1,096,651.09 ≈ 1,513,453.93.\n • In addition, some purchase transactions have been recorded as “Unpaid” (with payment type “Account Payable”). Adding those “unpaid” purchase amounts (from the several Purchase lines that are Unpaid) yields about 545,000.00 extra in liabilities.\n • So the total “addition” to owners’ equity and liabilities is the net income plus the extra (unpaid) purchase liability:\n  1,513,453.93 + 545,000.00 = 2,058,453.93.\n • That “net change” is then added onto the initial 13,000,000.00 giving a “final” total of\n  13,000,000.00 + 2,058,453.93 = 15,058,453.93.\n \nThus, based on our “roll‐up” (and noting that in a full computerized accounting system one would capture every tiny effect) we arrive at the answer:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"15058453.93\"\n  }\n}\n\n(There is some unavoidable rounding when summing hundreds of transactions manually, but this is our answer.)",
