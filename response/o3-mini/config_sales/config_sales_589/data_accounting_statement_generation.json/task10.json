                        "content": "We must “build up” the non‐current assets “balance” only from those transactions which actually affect fixed assets. In our data the only non‐current asset value comes from the Initial “Fixed Assets” row (5000000.0) and its subsequent “adjustment” through depreciation. (None of the other “Purchase” transactions—in which products such as Premium Product A, B, etc. are purchased—are capital expenditures that add to fixed assets; they represent inventory or operating items, so they are ignored for our property, plant and equipment calculation.) \n\nThus:\n• The “initial” non‐current asset amount is 5000000.0.\n• Then the depreciation for 2024‐01‐01 is 45749.3; when a depreciation expense is recorded the “net book value” of the fixed assets is reduced by that amount.\n\nCalculating the “end” value:\n  5000000.00 – 45749.30 = 4954250.70\n\nWe then format the numbers to two decimals.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"4954250.70\"\n  }\n}",
