                        "content": "We must first “build” the Accounts Payable balance (a liability) based on the purchase transactions that have not been paid (ie, the ones recorded and “Unpaid” with the payment method “Account Payable”). In our table we have many transactions but only a few Purchase rows add to Accounts Payable. In our case only those “Purchase” transactions with payment/receipt_status = Unpaid and payment_method = Account Payable create a liability.\n\nStep‐by‐step we scan the “Purchase” rows in the data:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001  \n  • Amount = 25,000.0  \n  • Payment Status = Paid  \n  → Does not add to Accounts Payable.\n\n2. Purchase20231231002  \n  • Amount = 90,000.0  \n  • Payment Status = Unpaid and Payment Method = Account Payable  \n  → Add 90,000.0\n\n3. Purchase20231231003  \n  • Amount = 30,000.0  \n  • Payment Status = Unpaid and Payment Method = Account Payable  \n  → Add 30,000.0\n\n4. Purchase20231231004  \n  • Amount = 250,000.0 (Paid)  \n  → Ignore.\n\n5. Later we find Purchase20231231018  \n  • Amount = 60,000.0  \n  • Payment Status = Unpaid and Payment Method = Account Payable  \n  → Add 60,000.0\n\n6. Purchase20231231024  \n  • Amount = 200,000.0  \n  • Payment Status = Unpaid and Payment Method = Account Payable  \n  → Add 200,000.0\n\n7. Purchase20231231026  \n  • Amount = 25,000.0  \n  • Payment Status = Unpaid and Payment Method = Account Payable  \n  → Add 25,000.0\n\n8. Purchase20231231027  \n  • Amount = 140,000.0  \n  • Payment Status = Unpaid and Payment Method = Account Payable  \n  → Add 140,000.0\n\nAll other purchase transactions either are paid or do not use “Account Payable” as their payment method; thus they do not affect the liability.\n\nNow sum the amounts that add to Accounts Payable:\n  90,000.0 + 30,000.0 = 120,000.0  \n  120,000.0 + 60,000.0 = 180,000.0  \n  180,000.0 + 200,000.0 = 380,000.0  \n  380,000.0 + 25,000.0 = 405,000.0  \n  405,000.0 + 140,000.0 = 545,000.0\n\nThus the final Increase in Accounts Payable is 545,000.00.\n\nWe now provide the answer in the required JSON format.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"545000.00\"\n  }\n}",
