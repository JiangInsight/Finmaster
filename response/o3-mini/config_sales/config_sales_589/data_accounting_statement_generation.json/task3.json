                        "content": "We first need to “build” an inventory account from the transactions that “deal” with inventory‐holding products. In this problem only the “Purchase” and “Sale” transactions affect inventory. (The “Initial” transactions establish other kinds of balances but not inventory on hand.) For each purchase the “amount” is exactly the cost paid for a number of units (the cost per unit multiplied by quantity) and for each sale the “cost_amount” represents how much “cost” of goods left inventory (i.e. cost of goods sold).\n\nStep 1. Sum up all the purchase amounts (i.e. the cost with which inventory was brought in). From the “Purchase” rows you have:\n\n• Purchase20231231001:  25,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231002:  90,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231003:  30,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231004: 250,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231005:  60,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231006: 200,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231007: 400,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231008:  80,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231009: 100,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231010:  35,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231011: 500,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231012:  15,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231013:  90,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231014:  20,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231015: 100,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231016: 140,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231017:  35,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231018:  60,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231019:  50,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231020: 450,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231021:  30,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231022: 160,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231023:  20,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231024: 200,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231025:  50,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231026:  25,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231027: 140,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231028: 450,000.00  \n\nIf you add these up you get a total purchase cost of:\n\n  25,000 + 90,000 + 30,000 + 250,000 + 60,000 + 200,000 + 400,000 + 80,000 + 100,000 + 35,000 + 500,000 + 15,000 + 90,000 + 20,000 + 100,000 + 140,000 + 35,000 + 60,000 + 50,000 + 450,000 + 30,000 + 160,000 + 20,000 + 200,000 + 50,000 + 25,000 + 140,000 + 450,000 = 3,805,000.00\n\nStep 2. Sum up the “cost_amount” from every Sale transaction (the value that is “removed” from inventory when goods are sold). (Note that each sale row gives a “cost_amount” field.) When you go through every Sale row and add up its cost_amount you obtain a total cost sold of 3,565,000.00.\n\n(For example, one sale–Sale20240102003–lists cost_amount = 50,000.00; another lists 20,000.00; and so on. Adding all these “cost_amount” values from all the Sale rows gives 3,565,000.00.)\n\nStep 3. Inventory on hand at period end is the difference between what was purchased and what cost was “sold.”\n\n  Inventory End Value = Total Purchases – Total Cost Sold  \n               = 3,805,000.00 – 3,565,000.00  \n               = 240,000.00\n\nStep 4. Since no opening inventory was provided (the initial transactions did not include any “inventory” item) we assume that the inventory initial value is 0.00.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Inventory End Value\": \"240000.00\"\n  }\n}",
