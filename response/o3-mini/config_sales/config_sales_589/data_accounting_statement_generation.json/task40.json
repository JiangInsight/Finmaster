                        "content": "We first “re‐build” the inventory balance from the detailed transactions. In our simplified approach we assume that when new purchases come in the inventory increases by the cost of those purchases and when you sell items you “remove” that cost from inventory (by recording the cost amount on the sale). Then, with no beginning inventory (other than the “initial” cash and fixed‐asset items that are not “inventory”), the end–of–period inventory is simply:\n\n  Ending Inventory (at cost) = (Total cost of all purchases) – (Total cost of goods sold)\n\nBelow we show step–by–step how we arrived at the numbers:\n\n1. (A) Identify the purchase transactions (each “Purchase…” row has a cost_per_unit and quantity; note that the “amount” column is exactly the product of quantity×cost_per_unit). For each purchase we add the transaction’s cost.\n  For example, one row – Purchase20231231001 – has 5 units at 5000.0 per unit giving 5×5000.0 = 25,000.\n  By scanning each purchase row we get (in order; all figures are in currency units):\n\n  • Purchase20231231001: 25,000  \n  • Purchase20231231002: 90,000  \n  • Purchase20231231003: 30,000  \n  • Purchase20231231004: 250,000  \n  • Purchase20231231005: 60,000  \n  • Purchase20231231006: 200,000  \n  • Purchase20231231009: 100,000  \n  • Purchase20231231010: 35,000  \n  • Purchase20231231011: 500,000  \n  • Purchase20231231012: 15,000  \n  • Purchase20231231013: 90,000  \n  • Purchase20231231014: 20,000  \n  • Purchase20231231015: 100,000  \n  • Purchase20231231016: 140,000  \n  • Purchase20231231017: 35,000  \n  • Purchase20231231018: 60,000  \n  • Purchase20231231019: 50,000  \n  • Purchase20231231020: 450,000  \n  • Purchase20231231021: 30,000  \n  • Purchase20231231022: 160,000  \n  • Purchase20231231023: 20,000  \n  • Purchase20231231024: 200,000  \n  • Purchase20231231025: 50,000  \n  • Purchase20231231026: 25,000  \n  • Purchase20231231027: 140,000  \n  • Purchase20231231028: 450,000\n\n  When we add these up we obtain a total purchase cost of 3,325,000.\n\n2. (B) Next, we review the “Sale…” rows. Each sale row lists a “cost_amount” (the cost of goods sold for that sale). Adding up the cost amounts from all the sale rows we get a total cost of goods sold of 3,085,000.\n\n  For example, the first sale record (Sale20240102003) shows a cost_amount = 50,000. Then Sale20240102004 shows 20,000, and so on. (When you add up the cost amounts from all sale transactions – there are many such rows – the total comes to 3,085,000.)\n\n3. (C) Then the ending inventory (valued at cost) is the purchased cost (3,325,000) less the cost of goods sold (3,085,000):\n  3,325,000 – 3,085,000 = 240,000\n\nSince an increase in inventory represents an “investment” in working capital (which will appear as a use of cash in the operating section of an indirect cash flow statement), you show it as a negative number (that is, an increase in inventory “uses” cash). \n\nThus the final inventory (the net change that is “subtracted” in the cash flow adjustments) is –240,000.00\n\nThe answer must be given as:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-240000.00\"\n  }\n}",
