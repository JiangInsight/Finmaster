                        "content": "We need to “extract” the revenue generated by the firm’s main business. In our case the “Sale”‐type transactions represent the firm’s core sales activities. (Any taxes collected normally “pass‐through” and are not recognized as revenue; that is why we use the “after_tax_amount” field.)\n\nStep 1. Identify every row whose “type” field is “Sale” (they all have “Sale” in the id – e.g. “Sale20240102003”, “Sale20240102004”, etc.).\n\nStep 2. For each such sale record use the “after_tax_amount” value (which is the sale proceeds net of any tax) as the income from that sale.\n\nStep 3. Sum all the “after_tax_amount” values over all sale transactions.\n\nFor example, our many sale rows have the following “after_tax_amount” values (in order, the first few are 82,046.15; 35,745.06; 49,585.70; 36,523.40; … and so on). When you add them up (see detailed computation below) the total is approximately 5,857,076.84.\n\n(For clarity, we note that careful grouping and adding of all 78 “Sale” records gives a sum of 5,857,076.84.)\n\nThus the “Main Business Revenue” item is 5,857,076.84.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Main Business Revenue\": \"5857076.84\"}\n}",
