                        "content": "We need to “close‐out” the balance of trade receivables by “adding up” all the sales that were made on credit (that is, where the receive method is “Account Receviable” or “Account Receivable”) plus any interest on receivables that has not been collected – then we compare that to the opening balance. In our case the beginning balance is zero so the “change” is the ending balance. (In a cash‐flow statement an increase in receivables is shown as a use of cash, i.e. negative.)\n\nLet’s explain step‐by‐step.\n\nFor every “Sale” transaction we inspect its “receive_method.” Only those rows where the receive method indicates a credit sale (written as “Account Receviable” in our file) are “added” using their “after_tax_amount” value. Also – separately – every “Interest Receivables” row that is “Unpaid” is taken into account (because interest income that has not been collected is included in accounts receivable).\n\nIn our table the “credit sale” rows are (showing the “after_tax_amount” in each case):\n\n• Sale20240102004:    35745.06  \n• Sale20240103007:    36523.40  \n• Sale20240105015:    33849.62  \n• Sale20240108026:    35983.00  \n• Sale20240109030:    17743.99  \n• Sale20240110036:    53258.72  \n• Sale20240111040:    100441.78  \n• Sale20240112046:    99587.95  \n• Sale20240115058:    36164.71  \n• Sale20240117065:    35679.90  \n• Sale20240117067:    25574.13  \n• Sale20240118070:    67752.78  \n• Sale20240119074:    36423.32  \n• Sale20240120078:    55377.35  \n• Sale20240121081:    53131.64  \n• Sale20240121082:    185501.01  \n• Sale20240124090:    248810.02  \n• Sale20240126097:    37157.48  \n• Sale20240127102:    34651.00  \n• Sale20240128109:    255111.48  \n\nWhen these “after‐tax” amounts are added we obtain a total (for credit sales) of approximately:\n\n  35745.06 + 36523.40 = 72268.46  \n  72268.46 + 33849.62 = 106118.08  \n  106118.08 + 35983.00 = 142101.08  \n  142101.08 + 17743.99 = 159845.07  \n  159845.07 + 53258.72 = 213103.79  \n  213103.79 + 100441.78 = 313545.57  \n  313545.57 + 99587.95 = 413133.52  \n  413133.52 + 36164.71 = 449298.23  \n  449298.23 + 35679.90 = 484978.13  \n  484978.13 + 25574.13 = 510552.26  \n  510552.26 + 67752.78 = 578305.04  \n  578305.04 + 36423.32 = 614728.36  \n  614728.36 + 55377.35 = 670105.71  \n  670105.71 + 53131.64 = 723237.35  \n  723237.35 + 185501.01 = 908738.36  \n  908738.36 + 248810.02 = 1,157548.38  \n  1,157548.38 + 37157.48 = 1,194705.86  \n  1,194705.86 + 34651.00 = 1,229356.86  \n  1,229356.86 + 255111.48 = 1,484468.34  \n\nNext we add the “Interest Receivables” that are still unpaid. (These are recorded on many dates with similar amounts; when one sums the following interest items the total comes to about 10,831.52.)\n\nThe list (using approximate values) is as follows:\n  442.775, 442.775, 442.775, 442.775, 442.775, 433.875, 424.42158, 424.42158, 376.80658, 376.80658, 376.80658, 376.80658, 376.80658, 376.80658, 373.69158, 373.69158, 373.69158, 373.69158, 369.24158, 369.24158, 366.57158, 350.55158, 350.55158, 350.55158, 350.55158, 350.55158, 350.55158, 350.55158, 350.55158, 5.75346, 14.65346  \nwhich sums to roughly 10,831.52.\n\nThus, the ending accounts receivable balance is the sum of credit sales and interest receivables:\n  1,484,468.34 + 10,831.52 ≈ 1,495,299.86\n\nBecause there was no beginning balance for accounts receivable (no prior credit sales), the entire ending balance represents the change. In a cash‐flow statement (using the indirect method) an increase in accounts receivable is shown as a “use” of cash, so it appears with a minus sign.\n\nThus the final (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable is –1,495,299.86.\n\nWe now present the answer as requested.\n\nFinal answer in JSON:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-1495299.86\"\n  }\n}",
