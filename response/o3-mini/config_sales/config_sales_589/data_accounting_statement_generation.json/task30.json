                        "content": "We must “pick‐out” only those transactions that represent expense items (or “period costs”) so that we can arrive at the final “expenses” figure. In our data the only rows we add are those whose “type” begins with “Expense” (which come in various forms – Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Financial Expenses, etc.) and also the “Depreciation” row because that is recognized as an operating expense. (Note that rows with “Purchase,” “Sale,” “Initial,” “Fixed Assets,” “Transfer” and even “Interest Receivables” are not “expense” items in the income statement.) \n\nBelow is one way to work through the table step‐by‐step:\n\n1. From the table we ignore the “Initial…” rows (cash deposit, bank deposit, fixed assets) as well as the “Purchase…”, “Sale…”, “FixedAsset…” and “Transfer…” rows.\n2. We focus on the rows whose type starts with “Expense” and the one “Depreciation…” row.\n3. For each “Expense…” (or “Depreciation…”) row we add its “amount” value.\n4. (Any rows with “Interest Receivables” are not expenses; they are reported on the balance sheet.)\n\nFor example, in our table the first few expense rows are:\n\n• Expense20240101001 (Sales Expenses): 24,861.73  \n• Expense20240101001 (Administrative Expenses): 29,611.11  \n• Expense20240101001 (Sales Expenses): 16,439.23  \n• Depreciation20240101001 (Depreciation): 45,749.30  \n\n…and then many additional “Expense…” rows follow. (A complete scan of the table – using the “type” filter – and then adding the “amount” values from each expense row gives the cumulative sum.)\n\nWhen you add up (step‐by‐step) the amounts of all rows that are of “Expense” or “Depreciation” types, you obtain a grand total of 1,321,396.45. \n\nThus the final total expenses item in the income statement is 1,321,396.45.\n\nBelow is the answer in the expected JSON format:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Expenses\": \"1321396.45\"} }\n```",
