In our dataset the only “investing”‐related entry (aside from the “initial” transactions that are financing in nature) is the one with type “Fixed Assets Purchase”. (In the sample the “Initial Fixed Assets” entry was not counted in investing, only the separate “Fixed Assets Purchase” entry was.) \n\nFor our problem the only investing activity is the row\n\n  id = FixedAsset20231231001  type = Fixed Assets Purchase  amount = 106218.2\n\nThis transaction represents a cash outflow (a purchase of a fixed asset). Therefore, the net cash flow from investing activities is –106218.2.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-106218.2'} }",
