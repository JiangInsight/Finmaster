                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” the owner’s equity change by recognizing that the beginning balance comes only from the “Initial20231231001” transactions (cash, bank and fixed‑assets) and then all “operating” transactions (the many sales, expenses, depreciation and interest‐earning items) affect the net profit (i.e. retained earnings) and thus “adjust” owner’s equity. (Purchases of inventory or fixed assets and “paid” purchases – even if made “unpaid” – are part of the asset/liability mix and – by themselves – do not change the owner’s equity.) \n\nIn our case the three initial postings are\n\n  Cash deposit =  3,000,000.00 \n  Bank deposit =  5,000,000.00 \n  Fixed Assets =  5,000,000.00 \n  ––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n  Total Initial Owners’ Equity = 13,000,000.00\n\nThen the “operating” part produces a net income. You can (in principle) “read‐off” the profit for each sale – it is given in the “profit” column – and then subtract (all the) expense‐type amounts (whether for Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Depreciation, Financial Expenses, etc.). Also, the “Interest Receivables” are recognized as revenue even if not yet paid.\n\nA (step–by–step) executive summary of our work is as follows (numbers are taken from every “Sale…” row and every “Expense…” row and the “Depreciation” row, with similar treatment for the “Interest…” rows):\n\n1. Summing over all sale transactions we obtain (approximately) a total “profit” of about 2,690,244.07.\n2. Summing all expense–type transactions (expenses on Sales, Administrative, Financial, Depreciation, etc.) over all dates we get roughly 1,145,464.00.\n3. The various “Interest Receivables” add roughly 10,811.14 to net income.\n4. Thus the net income computed is\n\n  Net income ≈ (sum of sale profits + interest revenue) – (sum of expense amounts)\n          ≈ (2,690,244.07 + 10,811.14) – 1,145,464.00 \n          ≈ 2,701,055.21 – 1,145,464.00 = 1,555,591.21\n\n5. Finally, the ending owners’ equity is the beginning owners’ equity plus the net income earned over the period. That is,\n\n  Total Owners’ Equity End Value = 13,000,000.00 + 1,555,591.21\n                     ≈ 14,555,591.21\n\n(One may note that in our earlier example the small‐sized “operating” results were a loss, so the final value was lower than the initial; here the “premium” product business shows a positive operating result.)\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \n    \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"14555591.21\"\n  }\n}\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the result obtained by (approximately) summing the “profit” items on each sale and subtracting the summed “operating expense” items (and adding interest income) so that\n\n  Final OE = Initial OE + (Total Sale Profits + Total Interest – Total Expenses).",
