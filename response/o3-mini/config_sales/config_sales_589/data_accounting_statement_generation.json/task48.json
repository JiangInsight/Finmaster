In net the cash (and equivalents) have decreased by about 358,350.\n\nThus, in the final cash flow statement the “net increase in cash and cash equivalents” is –358350.09.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"-358350.09\"}}",
