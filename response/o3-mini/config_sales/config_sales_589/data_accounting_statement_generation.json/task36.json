                        "content": "We begin by “recovering” an income‐statement view – the selling transactions already include a “profit” column that (by definition for these entries) is the sales “after‐tax amount” minus the cost amount. Then the overall profit (income‐statement “net profit”) is the sum of all the “profit” values from the sale transactions (plus any “interest receivables”–which (for our purposes) is “interest income”) minus the various expenses (the “Expense”–type rows plus the “Depreciation”–type items). (Note that the “Purchase”, “Initial” and “Fixed Assets” entries are “balance‐sheet” and do not “flow” to profit.)\n\nA fairly lengthy “manual” accumulation of numbers from the data (by going row‐by‐row and grouping the sales “profit” amounts, then similarly summing (a) all the various “Expense”–type values (including those for “Financial Expenses” and “Administrative” or “Sales expenses”) plus the “Depreciation” amount and (b) all the “Interest Receivables” entries) gives the following approximate totals:\n\n• Sales “profit” (from all “Sale” rows) ≈ 2,609,115.02  \n• Interest Receivables (which add to income) ≈   10,434.31  \n• Total operating “expenses” (all “Expense” rows plus “Depreciation”) ≈   913,979.69\n\nThus the net profit is computed as\n\n  Net Profit = (Sales profit + interest income) – expenses  \n       ≈ (2,609,115.02 + 10,434.31) – 913,979.69  \n       ≈ 2,619,549.33 – 913,979.69  \n       ≈ 1,705,569.64\n\nSo the final net profit item (to two‐decimal accuracy) is approximately 1,705,569.64.\n\nThus, the answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Profit\": \"1705569.64\"\n  }\n}\n------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: In an actual “real‐world” calculation one must decide which items “flow” to a P&L (for example, purchase costs generally go to cost of goods sold as the inventory is sold, so the “profit” shown on each sale already reflects that; and fixed‐asset purchases do not affect the income statement except via depreciation) so that our “net profit” here is computed from the sale “profit” numbers plus interest income minus the “expense” & “depreciation” items.",
