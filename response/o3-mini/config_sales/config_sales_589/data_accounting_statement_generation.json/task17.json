                        "content": "We “net‐off” (in one “period”) the operating “profit” (provided by the sale–records plus any interest income) against the “expenses” (for selling, administration, depreciation and financial expenses). In our books the opening (beginning‐of–period) retained earnings are zero (the “Initial” transactions set up assets, but no accumulated profit or loss yet). Then, after all transactions are “netted” the net income (that is, the total profit from sales plus interest income minus the expenses and depreciation expense) comes out about +1,571,950. (That is, roughly 2,690,344 from all sales plus about 9,172 from interest income is reduced by about 1,127,566 in expenses – see step‐by‐step summary below.) \n\nStep–by–step overview (very roughly):\n\n1. Only “sale”–transactions carry a computed “profit” column. Adding up each sale’s profit we get roughly 2,690,344.07.\n2. Several “interest receivables” rows (all with positive amounts – even if “unpaid” they reflect income) sum to about 9,172.05.\n3. On the “cost/expense” side we add up all “Expense”–records of types Sales, Administrative and Financial as well as the single Depreciation record (which in our data is 45,749.30) and obtain about 1,127,566.13.\n4. Thus net income ≈ (2,690,344.07 + 9,172.05) – 1,127,566.13 ≈ 1,571,950.\n5. Because there was no retained earning balance to start (the “Initial” records do not “earn” profit), the end‐of–period retained earnings equals the period’s net profit.\n\nAccordingly the answer is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"1571949.99\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis answer is rounded to two decimals and shows an ending retained earning balance of approximately 1,571,950.",
