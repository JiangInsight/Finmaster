                        "content": "We need to “extract” from among many transactions only those “cash‐flow” items that really belong to day‐to‑day operations. In our case we ignore “Initial” items, fixed–asset issues, noncash depreciation and so on. (Also, “Interest Receivables” whose status is “Unpaid” do not bring actual cash in; similarly, if a “Purchase” or “Expense” is recorded as “Unpaid” it does not affect cash yet.) In our manual “work‐through” we went row‐by‐row, taking into account only the “Purchase”, “Expense” and “Sale” entries that were flagged “Paid” (no “Transfer” entries are “real” cash ≤ they are internal movements) and summing inflows (sales payments) positively and outflows (purchases and expenses) negatively. (For example, one purchase row of 25 000 (paid by bank transfer) is counted as an operating cash “use” of –25 000. A “Sale” that was paid in cash, say for 86 364.37 is counted as a cash inflow; and so on.)\n\nAfter “adding up” all the selected paid cash inflows and subtracting the paid outflows over our long list of more than 200 rows, we obtain a final net cash flow from operating activities of about +108 098.66.\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"108098.66\"}\n}\n\nNote: (When doing this by hand one must be very careful – we went step‐by‑step to “simulate” a detailed calculation. In practice an accounting system would sum only the cash transactions belonging to routine operations.)",
