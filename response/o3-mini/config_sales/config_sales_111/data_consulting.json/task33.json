                        "content": "We first extract the key numbers from the provided statements.\n\nStep 1. Identify key items from the Balance Sheet (using end amounts):\n• Total Current Assets = 10,261,562.67 \n• Inventory = 430,000.00 \n• Total Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 1,260,000.00 + 288,001.20 = 1,548,001.20 \n• Total Owner’s Equity = 14,105,265.77 \n\nStep 2. From the Cash Flow statement (end date):\n• Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 803,237.11 \n\nStep 3. From the Income Statement:\n• Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = 3,140,000.00 \n\nStep 4. Calculate each ratio.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \nFormula: Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities  \n= 803,237.11 / 1,548,001.20  \n≈ 0.5189 → Rounded to 0.52\n\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \n(Here we use the same debt base as the current liabilities, as in the sample.)  \n= 803,237.11 / 1,548,001.20  \n≈ 0.5189 → 0.52\n\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio  \nFor the inventory turnover, we use the average inventory. Since the beginning inventory is 0.00 and the ending inventory is 430,000.00,  \nAverage Inventory = (0 + 430,000.00) / 2 = 215,000.00  \nThen, Inventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory  \n= 3,140,000.00 / 215,000.00  \n≈ 14.6047 → 14.60\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n= Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity  \n(Here total liabilities are taken as current liabilities, as in the sample.)  \n= 1,548,001.20 / 14,105,265.77  \n≈ 0.1097 → 0.11\n\n5. Quick Ratio  \nFormula: Quick Ratio = (Total Current Assets – Inventory) / Total Current Liabilities  \n= (10,261,562.67 – 430,000.00) / 1,548,001.20  \n= 9,831,562.67 / 1,548,001.20  \n≈ 6.348 → 6.35\n\n6. Current Ratio  \n= Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \n= 10,261,562.67 / 1,548,001.20  \n≈ 6.631 → 6.63\n\nThus, the final results are:\n\n{\n  \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"0.52\", \n  \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"0.52\", \n  \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"14.60\", \n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\", \n  \"Quick Ratio\": \"6.35\", \n  \"Current Ratio\": \"6.63\"\n}\n\nBelow is the answer in the required json format. \n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"0.52\", \n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"0.52\", \n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"14.60\", \n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\", \n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"6.35\", \n    \"Current Ratio\": \"6.63\"\n  }\n}",
