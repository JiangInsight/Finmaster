                        "content": "Let's work through each ratio step-by-step.\n\n1. Return on Equity (ROE)\n\nROE is calculated by dividing the Net Profit by the average Owner’s Equity. Here the Owner’s Equity on the balance sheet is:\n• Initial Owner’s Equity = Paid-in Capital (since Retained Earnings are 0) = 13,000,000.00  \n• Ending Owner’s Equity = 14,105,265.77  \n\nThe average Owner’s Equity = (13,000,000.00 + 14,105,265.77) / 2  \n  = 27,105,265.77 / 2  \n  ≈ 13,552,632.89\n\nNet Profit from the income statement = 1,105,265.77\n\nThus, ROE = (Net Profit / Average Owner's Equity) × 100%  \n  = (1,105,265.77 / 13,552,632.89) × 100%  \n  ≈ 8.16%\n\n2. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\nThis ratio is calculated by dividing total liabilities by total assets. From the balance sheet:\n• Total Liabilities (given as Total Current Liabilities) = 1,548,001.20  \n• Total Assets at the end = 15,653,266.97\n\nThus, Debt to Asset Ratio = 1,548,001.20 / 15,653,266.97  \n  ≈ 0.0989, which rounds to about 0.10\n\n3. Gross Profit Margin\n\nGross Profit Margin is given by Gross Profit divided by Total Revenue. From the income statement:\n• Gross Profit = 2,620,023.09  \n• Total Revenue = 5,760,023.09\n\nThus, Gross Profit Margin = (2,620,023.09 / 5,760,023.09) × 100%  \n  ≈ 45.40%\n\nThe final answers are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"8.16%\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.10\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"45.40%\"\n  }\n}",
