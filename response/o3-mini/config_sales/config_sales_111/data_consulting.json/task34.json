                        "content": "Let's work through each ratio step‐by‐step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n • The cash flow statement gives the net cash provided by operating activities = 803237.11  \n • The balance sheet shows Total Current Liabilities = 1548001.20  \n • Ratio = 803237.11 ÷ 1548001.20 ≈ 0.5189, which we round to 0.52\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n • From the balance sheet, Total Liabilities = 1548001.20 (in this case only current liabilities are provided)  \n • Total Owner’s Equity = 14105265.77  \n • Ratio = 1548001.20 ÷ 14105265.77 ≈ 0.1097, or about 0.11\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n • From the income statement, Total Revenue = 5760023.09  \n • From the balance sheet, Total Assets (end) = 15653266.97  \n • Ratio = 5760023.09 ÷ 15653266.97 ≈ 0.3677, or about 0.37\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Quick Ratio  \n • Quick (or liquid) assets include Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, and Accounts Receivable.  \n  – Cash on Hand = 4863237.11  \n  – Bank Deposits = 3502535.57  \n  – Interest Receivable = 11346.19  \n  – Accounts Receivable = 1454443.80  \n • Sum of quick assets = 4863237.11 + 3502535.57 + 1454443.80 + 11346.19 = 9831562.67  \n • Current Liabilities (from balance sheet) = 1548001.20  \n • Ratio = 9831562.67 ÷ 1548001.20 ≈ 6.35\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n • This is often defined the same as the operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio.  \n • Hence, Ratio = 803237.11 ÷ 1548001.20 ≈ 0.52\n\n──────────────────────────────\n6. Return on Equity (ROE)  \n • Net Profit from the income statement = 1105265.77  \n • Owner's Equity from the balance sheet = 14105265.77  \n • ROE = 1105265.77 ÷ 14105265.77 ≈ 0.07838, which is about 7.84%  \n  (Expressed as a percentage: 7.84%)\n\n──────────────────────────────\n7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n • The standard formula is: Accounts Receivable Turnover = Net Credit Sales ÷ Average Accounts Receivable  \n • For simplicity, assuming all sales are on credit and the beginning Accounts Receivable is 0, the average Accounts Receivable = (0 + Ending Accounts Receivable)/2 = 1454443.80 ÷ 2 = 727221.90  \n • From the income statement, Total Revenue (used as a proxy for net credit sales) = 5760023.09  \n • Ratio = 5760023.09 ÷ 727221.90 ≈ 7.92\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThus, the final calculated ratios are:\n\n{\n  \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"0.52\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\",\n  \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.37\",\n  \"Quick Ratio\": \"6.35\",\n  \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"0.52\",\n  \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"7.84%\",\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"7.92\"\n}\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.",
