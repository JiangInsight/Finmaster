Gross Profit Margin is calculated by:\n  Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n  Gross Profit = 2,620,023.09  \n  Total Revenue = 5,760,023.09\n\nThus,\n  Gross Profit Margin = (2,620,023.09 / 5,760,023.09) × 100  \n  ≈ 0.4542 × 100  \n  ≈ 45.42%\n\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is often calculated using the net cash flow from operating activities divided by the total current liabilities. (The sample problem used the \"Total Current Liabilities\" figure from the balance sheet as the “Debt”.)\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 803,237.11\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n  Total Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n\nThus,\n  Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = 803,237.11 / 1,548,001.20  \n  ≈ 0.52\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"45.42%\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"0.52\"\n  }\n}",
