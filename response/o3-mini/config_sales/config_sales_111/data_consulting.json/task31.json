                        "content": "Let's walk through the calculations step by step.\n\n1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n• The turnover ratio is generally calculated as:\n  Revenue / (Average Accounts Receivable)\n• Since the beginning Accounts Receivable (as of 2023‑12‑31) is 0 and the ending balance is 1,454,443.80, the average is:\n  (0 + 1,454,443.80) / 2 = 727,221.90\n• Revenue is given as 5,760,023.09.\n• Thus, the ratio = 5,760,023.09 / 727,221.90 ≈ 7.92\n\n2. Operating Cash Flow Ratios\n\nBoth the operating cash flow ratio and the operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio are computed as:\n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n• Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 803,237.11\n• Total Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n• Ratio = 803,237.11 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 0.52\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n• This ratio is usually calculated as:\n  Revenue / (Average Total Assets)\n• Total Assets at the beginning: 13,000,000.00 and at the end: 15,653,266.97\n• Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 15,653,266.97) / 2 = 14,326,633.49\n• Thus, the ratio = 5,760,023.09 / 14,326,633.49 ≈ 0.40\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n• In the absence of other liabilities, we assume Total Liabilities comes from the current liabilities figures.\n• Total Liabilities = 1,548,001.20 (from the balance sheet)\n• Total Owner’s Equity (end) = 14,105,265.77\n• Thus, the ratio = 1,548,001.20 / 14,105,265.77 ≈ 0.11\n\nThe final results in the required JSON format are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"7.92\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"0.52\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"0.52\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.40\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\"\n  }\n}",
