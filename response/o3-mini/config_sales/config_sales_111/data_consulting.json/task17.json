In the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is given as 803,237.11.\n\nThus, we calculate:\n  Ratio = 803,237.11 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 0.5186\n\nRounded to two decimal places, we get approximately 0.52.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"0.52\"\n  }\n}",
