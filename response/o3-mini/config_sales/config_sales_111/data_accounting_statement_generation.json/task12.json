                        "content": "We need to “build” the accounts‐payable balance by checking every purchase transaction that used the “Account Payable” payment method and was marked as “Unpaid” (note that paid purchases – even if they are purchases – do not add an outstanding liability). Also, our opening “Initial” transactions did not record any payable balance so the beginning value is zero.\n\nLet’s check the relevant Purchase rows one by one (only taking those with “Unpaid” and “Account Payable” as the payment/receipt method):\n\n1. Row with id Purchase20231231002: \n  amount = 60,000.0 → add 60,000  \n2. Row Purchase20231231003: \n  amount = 60,000.0 → add 60,000  \n  Total so far = 60,000 + 60,000 = 120,000  \n3. Row Purchase20231231004: \n  amount = 100,000.0 → add 100,000  \n  Total = 220,000  \n4. Row Purchase20231231005: \n  amount = 45,000.0 → add 45,000  \n  Total = 265,000  \n5. Row Purchase20231231008: \n  amount = 20,000.0 → add 20,000  \n  Total = 285,000  \n6. Row Purchase20231231009: \n  amount = 160,000.0 → add 160,000  \n  Total = 445,000  \n7. Row Purchase20231231010: \n  amount = 250,000.0 → add 250,000  \n  Total = 695,000  \n8. Row Purchase20231231012: \n  amount = 140,000.0 → add 140,000  \n  Total = 835,000  \n9. Row Purchase20231231014: \n  amount = 30,000.0 → add 30,000  \n  Total = 865,000  \n10. Row Purchase20231231018: \n  amount = 150,000.0 → add 150,000  \n  Total = 1,015,000  \n11. Row Purchase20231231019: \n  amount = 200,000.0 → add 200,000  \n  Total = 1,215,000  \n12. Row Purchase20231231022: \n  amount = 45,000.0 → add 45,000  \n  Total = 1,260,000  \n\nNone of the “Initial” lines or other transactions affect accounts payable (only purchasing on “Account Payable” status does).\n\nThus the beginning (initial) accounts payable balance is 0.00 and by the end the outstanding (unpaid) purchases add up to 1,260,000.00.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"1260000.00\"\n  }\n}",
