The beginning (“initial”) fixed asset balance coming from the “Initial20231231001” row that lists a “Fixed Assets” amount of 5,000,000.00.\n2. Additional fixed asset additions (purchases) that are recorded with type “Fixed Assets Purchase.” In our table there are two such rows:\n  • One with an amount of 321,724.42 (asset “Processing Equipment4”)\n  • A second with an amount of 115,740.01 (asset “Production Line5”)\n  Their total is – \n   321,724.42 + 115,740.01 = 437,464.43.\n3. Depreciation – which reduces the fixed assets. There is one “Depreciation20240101001” row showing 45,760.13.\n\nThus, the end value is calculated as\n\n  End Fixed Assets = Initial + Purchases – Depreciation \n    = 5,000,000.00 + 437,464.43 – 45,760.13 \n    = 5,437,464.43 – 45,760.13 \n    = 5,391,704.30\n\nSo the required answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'fixed assets net Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'fixed assets net End Value': '5391704.30'} }",
