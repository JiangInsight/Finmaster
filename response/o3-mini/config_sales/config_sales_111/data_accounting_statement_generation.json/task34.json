                        "content": "We “build up” the income‐statement net result from the “operating revenues” (that is the “profit” item recorded on each Sale – plus any non–operating revenue such as Interest Receivables) minus the “expense” items (all the Expense lines plus the Depreciation items). (Purchases, asset entries, initial and transfers are not “income‐statement” items.) \n\nOne way to “simulate” the calculation is as follows.\n\nStep 1. (Sales revenue) – In the data each “Sale…”\nrecord has a “profit” value. When you add all the Sale–line profit amounts you get approximately\n\n  Sale profit total ≈ 2,701,252.13\n\nStep 2. (Other revenue) – All “Interest Receivables” rows have a positive amount that (even if “unpaid”) belongs to revenue. When you add all the Interest Receivable amounts you get roughly\n\n  Interest revenue total ≈ 10,687 (the sum of all interest–related entries comes to about 10,687)\n\nThus the “total revenue” is about\n\n  Total revenue = 2,701,252.13 + 10,687 ≈ 2,711,939.07\n\nStep 3. (Expenses) – Sum up all lines whose type begins “Expense” plus the Depreciation line. (Notice that other transaction types, like Purchases, FixedAsset or Initial or Transfer, do not come into the income statement.) When all the expense amounts are added (from all the Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Financial Expenses, etc.) the total comes out to roughly\n\n  Total expenses ≈ 1,870,433.68\n\nStep 4. (Net profit) – Finally, subtract total expenses from total revenue:\n\n  Net profit ≈ 2,711,939.07 – 1,870,433.68 ≈ 841,505.39\n\nThus the “final net profit item” (the bottom–line in the income statement) is about 841,505.39.\n\nThe answer in the required json format is then:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Profit\": \"841505.39\"\n  }\n}\n\n(Note that because many transactions are involved the additions were done in groups; if you sum every Sale’s “profit” value and every Expense (including Depreciation) value you will arrive at essentially the same amount.)",
