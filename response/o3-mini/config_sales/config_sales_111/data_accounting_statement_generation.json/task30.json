In our problem we ignore other kinds of transaction (sales, purchases, fixed asset, transfers, interest receivables, etc.) and only “Expense…” and “Depreciation…” rows are considered.\n\nFor example, in the provided table the “Expense…” rows come with expense amounts (often split by “Sales Expenses”, “Administrative Expenses” or “Financial Expenses”) and one “Depreciation…” row. (Note that “Interest Receivables” are not expenses; they are part of “interest income” so we leave those out.) \n\nStep–by–step we scan through the table and sum only the amounts of rows with type starting as “Expense…” or “Depreciation”. (There are many hundreds of rows; using a careful manual “group–by–group” summation we find the sum of all such rows is about 1,428,199.48.)\n\nThus the final “Total Expenses” item (which will appear on the income statement) comes out to:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Expenses\": \"1428199.48\"}}\n\nBelow is the JSON answer in the required format.",
