In a cash‐flow statement only “investing” transactions are included: that is, those in which the company acquires or sells long–term assets (such as fixed assets), as opposed to operating (day‐to–day operations) or financing (capital and borrowing) activities.\n\nLooking over the list the only transactions we see that represent investing activities are the ones with type (or id) that indicate a fixed asset purchase. (Note that the “Initial … Fixed Assets” item is just an opening balance for the fixed asset “account” and is not included as a cash flow during the period.) In our data there are two investing transactions:\n\n1. A “Fixed Assets Purchase” row with id “FixedAsset20231231001” for Processing Equipment with an amount of 321724.42. As this represents money spent to acquire a long–term asset, it is a cash outflow (–321724.42).\n\n2. Another “Fixed Assets Purchase” row with id “FixedAsset20231231001” for Production Line with an amount of 115740.01. This also is an outflow (–115740.01).\n\nThere are no offsets (no fixed asset sales) so the net cash flow from investing activities is just the sum of these cash outflows. In other words, we sum:\n  –321724.42 + (–115740.01) = –437464.43\n\nThus the net cash flow from investing activities for the period is –437464.43.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-437464.43\"\n  }\n}",
