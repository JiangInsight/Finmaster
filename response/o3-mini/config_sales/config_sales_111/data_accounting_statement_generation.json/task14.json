                        "content": "We start by “listing” the transactions that represent obligations – that is, those purchases recorded as “Unpaid” (with payment method “Account Payable”) because these represent amounts that the company still owes at the reporting date. (Other “Initial” entries are asset injections or fixed‐asset purchases and are not liabilities, and items such as “Interest Receivables” are on the asset side.) \n\nBelow we list only the “Purchase” transactions that are recorded as Unpaid (its payment/receipt status is “Unpaid”):\n\n• Purchase20231231002: amount = 60,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231003: amount = 60,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231004: amount = 100,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231005: amount = 45,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231008: amount = 20,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231009: amount = 160,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231010: amount = 250,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231012: amount = 140,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231014: amount = 30,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231018: amount = 150,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231019: amount = 200,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231022: amount = 45,000.00  \n\nNow summing these amounts step‐by‐step:\n  – 60,000.00 + 60,000.00 = 120,000.00  \n  – 120,000.00 + 100,000.00 = 220,000.00  \n  – 220,000.00 + 45,000.00 = 265,000.00  \n  – 265,000.00 + 20,000.00 = 285,000.00  \n  – 285,000.00 + 160,000.00 = 445,000.00  \n  – 445,000.00 + 250,000.00 = 695,000.00  \n  – 695,000.00 + 140,000.00 = 835,000.00  \n  – 835,000.00 + 30,000.00 = 865,000.00  \n  – 865,000.00 + 150,000.00 = 1,015,000.00  \n  – 1,015,000.00 + 200,000.00 = 1,215,000.00  \n  – 1,215,000.00 + 45,000.00 = 1,260,000.00  \n\nThus the sum of current “unpaid” purchase transactions—which we consider to be the current liabilities end balance—is 1,260,000.00.\n\nSince no initial liabilities (at the beginning of the period) were recorded in the “Initial…” entries, the current liabilities initial value is 0.00.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"1260000.00\"\n  }\n}",
