                        "content": "We must “build up” the bank‐deposits figure from the “bank deposit” opening entry and then “adjust” for later transactions that affect the bank balance. (Only transactions that are “paid” by bank transfer or “fixed‐asset” transactions paid with a bank transfer will directly affect the bank deposits account.) In our dataset the only rows that affect bank deposits are those whose payment method is “Bank Transfer” or are “Fixed Assets Purchase” paid by bank transfer. (Keep in mind that “Unpaid” transactions or those paid by cash do not change the bank deposit.) In our case we identify the following lines that “hit” bank deposits:\n\n1. The opening “Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit” row gives:\n  +5,000,000.00\n\nThen look for the “paid by bank transfer” or “fixed asset” entries that are deducted (i.e. cash paid from bank):\n\n• Purchase20231231001: Paid via Bank Transfer for 40,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231007: Paid via Bank Transfer for 70,000.00  \n• FixedAsset20231231001 (first occurrence): Paid via Bank Transfer for 321,724.42  \n• Purchase20231231020: Paid via Bank Transfer for 250,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231021: Paid via Bank Transfer for 500,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231023: Paid via Bank Transfer for 40,000.00  \n• FixedAsset20231231001 (a later one): Paid via Bank Transfer for 115,740.01  \n• Purchase20231231024: Paid via Bank Transfer for 160,000.00\n\nNow, summing these outflows:\n  40,000.00 + 70,000.00 = 110,000.00  \n  110,000.00 + 321,724.42 = 431,724.42  \n  431,724.42 + 250,000.00 = 681,724.42  \n  681,724.42 + 500,000.00 = 1,181,724.42  \n  1,181,724.42 + 40,000.00 = 1,221,724.42  \n  1,221,724.42 + 115,740.01 = 1,337,464.43  \n  1,337,464.43 + 160,000.00 = 1,497,464.43\n\nThen the final bank deposit balance is given by subtracting the total outflow from the opening balance:\n  5,000,000.00 – 1,497,464.43 = 3,502,535.57\n\nThus the answer in the requested json format is:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"3502535.57\"\n  }\n}\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is our step‐by‐step calculation yielding an ending value of 3,502,535.57 for the bank deposits account.",
