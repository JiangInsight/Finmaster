                        "content": "We must first identify the transactions that affect the “property, plant and equipment” (non‐current assets). In our data the only rows that “change” the non‐current asset “pool” are:\n\n1. The initial “Fixed Assets” (given in the initial trial balance) which sets the beginning book value.  \n • Row “Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets …” has an amount of 5,000,000.00.\n\n2. The “Fixed Assets Purchase” transactions that add to the fixed asset balance. In our table there are two such rows:\n a. One with type “Fixed Assets Purchase” dated 2023‑12‑31, amount = 321,724.42 (with asset name “Processing Equipment4”).\n b. A second “Fixed Assets Purchase” (also dated 2023‑12‑31) with amount = 115,740.01 (with asset name “Production Line5”).\n\nWhen we add these two, we get:  \n 321,724.42 + 115,740.01 = 437,464.43\n\n3. There is one “Depreciation” transaction which reduces the book value of fixed assets.  \n • The depreciation row “Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation …” shows an amount of 45,760.13.\n\nThus we “adjust” the initial fixed assets by adding the purchases then subtracting depreciation to determine the end‐of‐period non‐current assets (fixed assets):\n\n• Initial fixed assets = 5,000,000.00  \n• Add fixed asset additions = +437,464.43  \n  Subtotal = 5,437,464.43  \n• Subtract depreciation = −45,760.13  \n  Resulting ending book value = 5,437,464.43 − 45,760.13 = 5,391,704.30\n\nSo the answers are:\n\n– Total Non‑current Assets Initial Value: 5,000,000.00  \n– Total Non‑current Assets End Value: 5,391,704.30\n\nWe now present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\nFinal answer:\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"5391704.30\"\n  }\n}",
