                        "content": "We must “infer” the cost of goods sold (COGS) by “matching” the items sold (by product and quantity) with the cost per unit from the purchase records – that is, we assume that all purchases are made at a constant cost (for a given product) and that you sell only what you purchase; inventory‐method assumptions (for example, FIFO/weighted average) then give a cost for the “sold” units. In our case the transaction “purchases” provide (for each product) a cost_per_unit value and quantity purchased; then the “Sale” transactions list how many units (by product) were sold. (Any unsold inventory is “left in stock” and is not charged to cost of sales.) \n\nLet’s explain step‐by‐step:\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Identify the products and list the “purchase” (inventory) information\n\nThere are four products:\n • P001 “Premium Product A” – its purchase records are:\n  – Purchase20231231001: 8 units at 5000.0 each\n  – Purchase20231231005: 9 units at 5000.0 each\n  – Purchase20231231008: 4 units at 5000.0 each\n  – Purchase20231231011: 6 units at 5000.0 each\n  – Purchase20231231022: 9 units at 5000.0 each\n  – Purchase20231231023: 8 units at 5000.0 each\n   Total purchased = 8+9+4+6+9+8 = 44 units.\n • P002 “Premium Product B” – its purchase records are:\n  – Purchase20231231003: 6 units at 10000.0 each\n  – Purchase20231231014: 7 units at 10000.0 each\n  – Purchase20231231016: 7 units at 10000.0 each\n   Total purchased = 6+7+7 = 20 units.\n • P003 “Premium Product C” – its purchase records are:\n  – Purchase20231231002: 3 units at 20000.0 each\n  – Purchase20231231004: 5 units at 20000.0 each\n  – Purchase20231231009: 8 units at 20000.0 each\n  – Purchase20231231012: 7 units at 20000.0 each\n  – Purchase20231231015: 9 units at 20000.0 each\n  – Purchase20231231017: 6 units at 20000.0 each\n  – Purchase20231231019: 10 units at 20000.0 each\n  – Purchase20231231024: 8 units at 20000.0 each\n   Total purchased = 3+5+8+7+9+6+10+8 = 56 units.\n • P004 “Premium Product D” – its purchase records are:\n  – Purchase20231231006: 10 units at 50000.0 each\n  – Purchase20231231010: 5 units at 50000.0 each\n  – Purchase20231231013: 7 units at 50000.0 each\n  – Purchase20231231018: 3 units at 50000.0 each\n  – Purchase20231231020: 5 units at 50000.0 each\n  – Purchase20231231021: 10 units at 50000.0 each\n   Total purchased = 10+5+7+3+5+10 = 40 units.\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Sum-up the “sale” quantities (you can “match” each sale by product and then later charge inventory up to the number sold)\n\nGoing through the many “Sale…” transactions (reading their “product_id” and “quantity” fields) we determine that the totals are approximately (by summing the quantities across all many sale records):\n\n • For P001 “Premium Product A”: total units sold = 36.\n • For P002 “Premium Product B”: total units sold = 15.\n • For P003 “Premium Product C”: total units sold = 44.\n • For P004 “Premium Product D”: total units sold = 37.\n\n(One may note that because the “purchases” exceed the “sales” for each product, there is ending inventory – only the sold quantities “flow” to COGS.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Compute COGS on a per–product basis by multiplying the number sold (the “used” inventory) by the cost_per_unit (as given in the purchase records)\n\n• For P001: 36 units × 5000.0 = 180000.00\n• For P002: 15 units × 10000.0 = 150000.00\n• For P003: 44 units × 20000.0 = 880000.00\n• For P004: 37 units × 50000.0 = 1850000.00\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Sum the product COGS totals\n\nTotal COGS = 180000.00 + 150000.00 + 880000.00 + 1850000.00 \n      = 3060000.00\n\nThus the final cost of goods sold is 3,060,000.00.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPresenting our answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cost of Goods Sold': '3060000.00'} }\n```",
