                        "content": "We have to “close‐up” the payable account by adding up the amounts from purchase transactions that (a) are recorded as “Unpaid” and (b) use “Account Payable” as the payment method (which means that these purchases were recorded on credit and thereby increased the liability plus there are no “payments” to decrease AP here).\n\nStep 1. Scan the “Purchase” transactions and pick only those rows whose “payment/receipt_status” is Unpaid and “payment_method” equals “Account Payable.” (If a purchase was paid by “Bank Transfer” or “Cash,” it is not recorded as increasing Accounts Payable.)\n\nStep 2. From the given table the relevant purchase rows are:\n\n• Purchase20231231002 – Amount = 60000.0  \n• Purchase20231231003 – Amount = 60000.0  \n• Purchase20231231004 – Amount = 100000.0  \n• Purchase20231231005 – Amount = 45000.0  \n• Purchase20231231008 – Amount = 20000.0  \n• Purchase20231231009 – Amount = 160000.0  \n• Purchase20231231010 – Amount = 250000.0  \n• Purchase20231231012 – Amount = 140000.0  \n• Purchase20231231014 – Amount = 30000.0  \n• Purchase20231231018 – Amount = 150000.0  \n• Purchase20231231019 – Amount = 200000.0  \n• Purchase20231231022 – Amount = 45000.0\n\nStep 3. Now, add these up:\n\n 60000.0 + 60000.0 = 120000.0  \n 120000.0 + 100000.0 = 220000.0  \n 220000.0 + 45000.0 = 265000.0  \n 265000.0 + 20000.0 = 285000.0  \n 285000.0 + 160000.0 = 445000.0  \n 445000.0 + 250000.0 = 695000.0  \n 695000.0 + 140000.0 = 835000.0  \n 835000.0 + 30000.0 = 865000.0  \n 865000.0 + 150000.0 = 1015000.0  \n 1015000.0 + 200000.0 = 1215000.0  \n 1215000.0 + 45000.0 = 1260000.0\n\nStep 4. There are no transactions that reduce Accounts Payable (for example, no “Paid” entries that impact this account) so the net change is an increase of 1,260,000.00.\n\nThus the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"1260000.00\"}\n}",
