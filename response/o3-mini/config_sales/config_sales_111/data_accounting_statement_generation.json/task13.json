(None of the “initial” transactions carry a tax component so the opening balance is zero.) For every sale record the data list the amount collected as tax (it is given in the field that comes right after the customer ID). Thus, the final “taxes payable” is the sum of all tax amounts on sale transactions during the period.\n\nFor example, in our table we have (by row ID):\n\n• Sale20240102003 – tax_amount = 5235.38  \n• Sale20240102004 – tax_amount = 1278.94  \n• Sale20240102005 – tax_amount = 1293.13  \n• Sale20240103008 – tax_amount = 5817.50  \n• Sale20240103009 – tax_amount = 4603.34  \n• Sale20240103010 – tax_amount = 1928.23  \n• Sale20240104013 – tax_amount = 459.22  \n• Sale20240104014 – tax_amount = 915.51  \n• Sale20240105017 – tax_amount = 8825.42  \n• Sale20240105018 – tax_amount = 1327.36  \n• Sale20240106021 – tax_amount = 1919.55  \n• Sale20240106022 – tax_amount = 954.40  \n• Sale20240106023 – tax_amount = 4751.40  \n• Sale20240107025 – tax_amount = 925.88  \n• Sale20240107026 – tax_amount = 3621.02  \n• Sale20240107027 – tax_amount = 864.97  \n• Sale20240108029 – tax_amount = 3698.73  \n• Sale20240108030 – tax_amount = 4453.80  \n• Sale20240108031 – tax_amount = 14924.55  \n• Sale20240108032 – tax_amount = 8536.71  \n• Sale20240109035 – tax_amount = 429.27  \n• Sale20240109036 – tax_amount = 1301.71  \n• Sale20240110037 – tax_amount = 3508.89  \n• Sale20240111040 – tax_amount = 1961.17  \n• Sale20240111041 – tax_amount = 5213.65  \n• Sale20240112044 – tax_amount = 8915.40  \n• Sale20240112045 – tax_amount = 452.85  \n• Sale20240113046 – tax_amount = 1897.79  \n• Sale20240114050 – tax_amount = 4601.93  \n• Sale20240114051 – tax_amount = 5513.59  \n• Sale20240114052 – tax_amount = 2643.54  \n• Sale20240115056 – tax_amount = 881.12  \n• Sale20240115057 – tax_amount = 3440.75  \n• Sale20240115058 – tax_amount = 942.64  \n• Sale20240116061 – tax_amount = 1825.38  \n• Sale20240116062 – tax_amount = 5663.90  \n• Sale20240117063 – tax_amount = 14235.36  \n• Sale20240117064 – tax_amount = 5226.38  \n• Sale20240117065 – tax_amount = 1948.03  \n• Sale20240118068 – tax_amount = 4436.44  \n• Sale20240118069 – tax_amount = 13952.91  \n• Sale20240118070 – tax_amount = 9107.96  \n• Sale20240118071 – tax_amount = 3514.41  \n• Sale20240119074 – tax_amount = 1784.51  \n• Sale20240119075 – tax_amount = 3576.15  \n• Sale20240120079 – tax_amount = 991.54  \n• Sale20240120080 – tax_amount = 9331.74  \n• Sale20240120081 – tax_amount = 1349.02  \n• Sale20240121084 – tax_amount = 1707.03  \n• Sale20240121085 – tax_amount = 432.86  \n• Sale20240121086 – tax_amount = 1876.28  \n• Sale20240122087 – tax_amount = 983.48  \n• Sale20240122088 – tax_amount = 4270.71  \n• Sale20240122089 – tax_amount = 4668.89  \n• Sale20240123093 – tax_amount = 468.48  \n• Sale20240123094 – tax_amount = 5747.36  \n• Sale20240123095 – tax_amount = 1993.26  \n• Sale20240123096 – tax_amount = 921.25  \n• Sale20240124098 – tax_amount = 864.22  \n• Sale20240124099 – tax_amount = 4316.38  \n• Sale20240124101 – tax_amount = 9245.14  \n• Sale20240125105 – tax_amount = 4934.77  \n• Sale20240125106 – tax_amount = 1410.20  \n• Sale20240126109 – tax_amount = 5369.73  \n• Sale20240126110 – tax_amount = 13943.64  \n• Sale20240127113 – tax_amount = 3824.26  \n• Sale20240127114 – tax_amount = 13423.74  \n• Sale20240127115 – tax_amount = 5898.57  \n• Sale20240128117 – tax_amount = 426.51  \n• Sale20240128118 – tax_amount = 1292.24  \n• Sale20240128119 – tax_amount = 4548.41\n\nWhen all of these are added the sum comes to approximately 287550.48. (You can verify by grouping the numbers and adding them step–by–step.) Since our “Initial…” entries do not carry tax and there are no opening tax payable balances, the opening balance for “taxes payable” is 0.00.\n\nThus the final “taxes payable” (the “end value”) is the accumulation of all these tax amounts — approximately 287550.48.\n\nOur answer is then provided as follows in the requested JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"287550.48\"} }",
