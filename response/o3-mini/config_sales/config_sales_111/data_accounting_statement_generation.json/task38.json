                        "content": "We have to “build” the accounts receivable balance from those transactions that increase AR (namely, credit‐sales and interest receivable that have not been collected) since the beginning AR is zero. (In a cash‐flow statement an increase in AR is shown as a use of cash, so the change is reported as a negative number.)\n\nStep‐by‐step we can do the following:\n\n1. From the “Sale” entries only include those whose “receive_method” is “Account Receviable” (i.e. credit sales) and then use their “after_tax_amount” as the amount that increased AR. In our table the following sale rows have AR as “receive_method” (with their “after_tax_amount” values):\n\n  • Sale20240102005: 24,569.51  \n  • Sale20240103008: 110,532.58  \n  • Sale20240106022: 18,133.50  \n  • Sale20240107026: 68,799.32  \n  • Sale20240107027: 16,434.33  \n  • Sale20240109035: 8,156.21  \n  • Sale20240112045: 8,604.09  \n  • Sale20240113046: 36,057.95  \n  • Sale20240116061: 34,682.23  \n  • Sale20240116062: 107,614.09  \n  • Sale20240118070: 173,051.28  \n  • Sale20240120080: 177,303.00  \n  • Sale20240121085: 8,224.41  \n  • Sale20240123094: 109,199.74  \n  • Sale20240124098: 16,420.16  \n  • Sale20240124099: 82,011.19  \n  • Sale20240124100: 8,563.73  \n  • Sale20240125105: 93,760.70  \n  • Sale20240127114: 255,051.06  \n  • Sale20240128118: 24,552.52  \n\nSumming these (step‐by‐step grouping can be done) you will obtain a total credit sales AR amount of about 1,380,721.60.\n\n2. Also, several “Interest Receivables” entries (all with an “Unpaid” status and “Interest receviable” noted) also add to AR. (In our table there are many such interest rows; if you sum all the amounts you get about 11,366.60.) \n\n3. Thus the ending AR balance is roughly\n  1,380,721.60 + 11,366.60 = 1,392,088.20\n\nSince the beginning balance of AR is zero, the (Increase) in AR is 1,392,088.20; in the cash‐flow statement an increase in a noncash asset is shown as a use of cash (i.e. a negative change).\n\nSo the final answer is an “(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable” of –1,392,088.20.\n\nThe answer in the required output format is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-1392088.20\"\n  }\n}",
