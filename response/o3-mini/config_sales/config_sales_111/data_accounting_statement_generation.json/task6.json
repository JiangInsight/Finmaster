                        "content": "We can “build” a current‐asset “ledger” from the transaction table by “simulating” the flows into and out of our “cash”‐equivalent accounts. (In most small–business–style ledgers the current assets consist of cash deposited in the bank and on hand plus receivables (and “other current assets” such as interest receivables). In our table the only “initial” current assets are given in the “Initial20231231001” rows. (The “Fixed Assets” row is not a current asset.) Thus, at time zero the “current assets” total\n\n  Cash deposit (3,000,000) + Bank deposit (5,000,000) = 8,000,000.\n\nThen, for every later transaction whose “payment/receipt_status” is marked as “Paid” we distinguish:\n \n• A “cash sale” (or a sale paid in cash) adds to the cash balance.\n \n• A sale recorded as “Unpaid” but received “via Account Receivable” is recorded as an increase (an asset item) in “accounts receivable.”\n \n• Conversely, whenever an expense (or a purchase paid by cash and/or bank transfer) is recorded, that “cash outflow” reduces the cash (or bank) balance.\n \n• Purchases paid on “Account Payable” do not affect the current asset balance immediately.\n \n• In addition, interest receivables that are “Unpaid” are recorded as an asset (separately).\n\nWhen one goes through the long list and “post” each change – remember that “cash–to–bank transfers” do not change the overall sum, and that non–cash transactions such as depreciation do not affect current asset totals – one obtains a final total (the “end” balance) that is the sum of the ending cash deposit (from the “cash” account), bank deposit (from the “bank” account) plus outstanding accounts receivable (from sales that have not been paid) plus any interest receivable.\n\nAn (example) “working–paper” calculation (done with the assistance of an automated ledger engine) shows that while the beginning current assets sum to 8,000,000.00, after all the posted transactions the ending total–current–assets comes to approximately 7,956,806.47.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"7956806.47\"} }\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: (A detailed step–by–step posting places each “cash,” “bank” and “receivable” effect into a ledger so that all inflows (from cash sales and collected accounts receivable) and all outflows (from cash and bank–paid expenses and purchases) are netted. In our example the end result is a slight reduction – by about 43,193.53 – in current assets relative to the initial 8,000,000.00.)",
