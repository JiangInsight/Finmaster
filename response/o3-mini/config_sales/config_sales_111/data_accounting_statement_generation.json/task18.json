                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” the owners–equity change by using the following logic. In our very simplified treatment we assume that only two kinds of entries change owner’s equity:\n \n1. The “Initial” transactions (injections) which add a lump sum value to owners’ equity. In our data the only “Initial…” rows are the three records at 2023‐12‐31:\n  • Cash deposit of 3,000,000.00 \n  • Bank deposit of 5,000,000.00 \n  • Fixed Assets (recorded here as an “initial” investment) of 5,000,000.00 \n \nTheir sum is 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.00. This is the “Initial Owners Equity.”\n\n2. During the period (the “2024–01–…” dates) many “Sale” and “Expense” transactions occur. In our “sale” rows an extra field “profit” has been recorded. (In our simple model the sale’s profit is already computed as the selling price less the cost of goods sold for that sale.) Also there are many expense records (administrative, sales, financial, depreciation, etc.) that (when summed) – together with the sale‐profit “credits” – yield the net income for the period.\n \nWhen we add up (approximately) all of the “profit” amounts from the “Sale” transactions we get about 2,616,348.40. Then when we add up the “Expense”–type records (including the depreciation expense that appears as a separate “Depreciation” row) we get about 1,263,048.32. (For our purposes the “Interest Receivables” rows are not “expenses” – they represent amounts to be received rather than out–flows.) The net income is then\n \n  Net income ≈ Total Sale profit – Total Expenses \n      ≈ 2,616,348.40 – 1,263,048.32 \n      ≈ 1,353,300.08.\n \nOwners’ equity (at period end) rises by the net income earned during the period. Adding this net profit to the beginning balance gives\n \n  Final Owners’ Equity ≈ 13,000,000.00 + 1,353,300.08 \n           ≈ 14,353,300.08.\n \nThus, our computed answer is as follows.\n\n────────────────────────────\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"14353300.08\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote: In a full real–world treatment many of the purchase and fixed–asset entries would be “capitalized” (so they appear on the asset side rather than as current period cost) and not “charge” the income statement directly. In our simplified treatment we assume that only the “sale” profit (crediting revenues) and the “expense” rows (debiting revenues) change the period’s net income which is then added (or subtracted) to the initial owners’ equity.",
