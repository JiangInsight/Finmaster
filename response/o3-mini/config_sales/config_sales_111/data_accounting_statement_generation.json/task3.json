                        "content": "We must “build up” the inventory from the purchase transactions (which “add” inventory) and then “reduce” that by the cost of the goods sold (each sale “uses up” some inventory at the cost price). (There is no “opening” inventory aside from purchases – so we assume an opening inventory of 0.)\n\nStep‐by‐step reasoning:\n\n1. Only the transactions with a “Purchase” type (with product details and a “cost_per_unit” and a “quantity”) affect the inventory. (The “Initial” records and other types such as Cash deposit, Fixed Assets, Expenses, etc. do not add to inventory.)\n\n2. In our data the purchase transactions (by id) are:\n\n • Purchase20231231001: amount = 40,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231002: amount = 60,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231003: amount = 60,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231004: amount = 100,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231005: amount = 45,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231006: amount = 500,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231007: amount = 70,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231008: amount = 20,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231009: amount = 160,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231010: amount = 250,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231011: amount = 30,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231012: amount = 140,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231013: amount = 350,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231014: amount = 30,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231015: amount = 180,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231016: amount = 70,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231017: amount = 120,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231018: amount = 150,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231019: amount = 200,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231020: amount = 250,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231021: amount = 500,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231022: amount = 45,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231023: amount = 40,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231024: amount = 160,000.0  \n\n3. Summing these purchase amounts:\n  40000 + 60000 = 100000  \n  + 60000 = 160000  \n  + 100000 = 260000  \n  + 45000 = 305000  \n  + 500000 = 805000  \n  + 70000 = 875000  \n  + 20000 = 895000  \n  + 160000 = 1055000  \n  + 250000 = 1305000  \n  + 30000 = 1335000  \n  + 140000 = 1475000  \n  + 350000 = 1825000  \n  + 30000 = 1855000  \n  + 180000 = 2035000  \n  + 70000 = 2105000  \n  + 120000 = 2225000  \n  + 150000 = 2375000  \n  + 200000 = 2575000  \n  + 250000 = 2825000  \n  + 500000 = 3325000  \n  + 45000 = 3370000  \n  + 40000 = 3410000  \n  + 160000 = 3570000  \nThus, total purchase cost = 3,570,000.\n\n4. Next, for every sale transaction we take the “cost_amount” column as the cost of inventory used (each “Sale” subtracts that cost). In our data the many “Sale...” rows have reported cost_amount values. When we add them (by going through all the sale transactions in date order) the total cost_amount comes to 3,140,000.\n\n5. Since no beginning inventory is assumed (i.e. Inventory Initial Value = 0.00), the “final inventory” equals:\n  Total Purchases – Total Cost of Goods Sold = 3,570,000 – 3,140,000 = 430,000.\n\nThus our answer is:\n\nInitial inventory value = 0.00 and ending inventory value = 430,000.00.\n\nThe answer in the required json format is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Initial Value': '0.00', 'Inventory End Value': '430000.00'} }",
