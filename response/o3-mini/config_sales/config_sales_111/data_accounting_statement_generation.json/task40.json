                        "content": "We can “think out loud” as follows. To compute the change in inventory we first have to add all the “Purchase”–type transactions that add to inventory and then subtract the cost‐of–goods–sold (that is, the “cost_amount” in the Sale transactions) which are “removed” from inventory. (We assume that the beginning inventory is zero.)\n\nStep 1. Sum purchases (each “Purchase” row has an amount that equals (cost per unit)×(quantity)):\n • Purchase20231231001: 8×5000.0 = 40,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231002: 3×20000.0 = 60,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231003: 6×10000.0 = 60,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231004: 5×20000.0 = 100,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231005: 9×5000.0 = 45,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231006: 10×50000.0 = 500,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231007: 7×10000.0 = 70,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231008: 4×5000.0 = 20,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231009: 8×20000.0 = 160,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231010: 5×50000.0 = 250,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231011: 6×5000.0 = 30,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231012: 7×20000.0 = 140,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231013: 7×50000.0 = 350,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231014: 3×10000.0 = 30,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231015: 9×20000.0 = 180,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231016: 7×10000.0 = 70,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231017: 6×20000.0 = 120,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231018: 3×50000.0 = 150,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231019: 10×20000.0 = 200,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231020: 5×50000.0 = 250,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231021: 10×50000.0 = 500,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231022: 9×5000.0 = 45,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231023: 8×5000.0 = 40,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231024: 8×20000.0 = 160,000.0 \n -----------------------------------------------------------------\n  Total purchases = 3,570,000.00\n\nStep 2. Sum the “cost_amount” from all the “Sale”–type transactions. (These rows already list the cost of goods sold for each sale.) When we carefully add all the cost_amount values from every sale row we get a grand total of 3,365,000.00.\n\nStep 3. Compute the net change:\n Net change in inventory = Total purchases – Total COGS = 3,570,000.00 – 3,365,000.00 = 205,000.00\n\nBecause an increase in inventory represents a use of cash, the “(Increase) Decrease in Inventory” item on the cash‐flow statement is reported with a minus sign. Therefore, the final inventory adjustment is –205,000.00.\n\nThe final answer is then presented in the required JSON format as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-205000.00\"} }",
