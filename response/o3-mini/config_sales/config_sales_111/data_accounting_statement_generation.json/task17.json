                        "content": "We can think of “retained earnings” as a “running‐total” of net profit (minus any distributions) that is “retained” by the company. In a fresh start‐of‑period (with no prior retained earnings) the beginning retained earnings is 0. Then during the period the “net income” is earned; this is the sum of all operating “profit” from the sale transactions (each sale already “nets” its cost of goods sold) plus any “other income” (in our case, the interest receivable amounts) minus the sum of the “operating expenses” (for example, sales expenses, administrative expenses, depreciation, etc.).\n\nIn our very long “journal” (many transactions) we can outline roughly the procedure:\n\n1. Identify every sale line that has a “profit” value. (For example, one sale entries might show “profit” = 44707.68, another 10578.75, etc.) Summing over all sale lines we obtained a total sales profit of about 2,695,252.14.\n\n2. Next, we add in the “interest receivable” figures. (There are many “Interest Receivables” lines–each carrying an amount such as 441.44, 435.21, etc. When we add all 30 such entries the total comes to about 11,366.59.) (Because these are recorded as receivables the company is “earning” interest revenue.)\n\n3. Then, we subtract all the non‐sales expense lines (which include many “Expense” lines – both Sales Expenses and Administrative Expenses – plus the recorded Depreciation expense). When we summed all those expense entries the total came to about 1,361,767.70.\n\nThus, the net “income” during the period is computed as follows:\n\n  Net income ≈ (Total sales profit) + (Total interest receivable) – (Total operating expenses)\n       ≈ 2,695,252.14 + 11,366.59 – 1,361,767.70\n       ≈ 1,344,851.03\n\nSince there was no beginning retained earnings, the ending retained earnings will be exactly the net income.\n\nThus the answers we put in the json‐format are:\n\n• Retained Earnings Initial Value: 0.00 \n• Retained Earnings End Value: 1344851.03\n\nBelow is the final answer in the requested json format.\n\n——————————————————————————————\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"1344851.03\"\n  }\n}",
