Identify all “Sale” transactions as the source of the main business revenue. In our table each sale record lists a “Sale…” id with an “amount” (which we assume represents the revenue figure) and a “cost_amount” (the cost of goods sold) and “profit”. Summing every sale’s amount gives a total revenue of about 6,109,226.74. (This is taken as “Main Business Revenue” as well as “Total Revenue”.)\n\n2. Similarly, summing the “cost_amount” from all sale transactions gives a total cost of goods sold of roughly 3,465,000.00.\n\n3. Gross profit is computed as Main Business Revenue minus Cost of Goods Sold (≈6,109,226.74 – 3,465,000.00 = 2,644,227.00).\n\n4. Next, among the expense records the ones with type “Administrative Expenses” are summed (from several dated entries) to yield about 219,307.60.\n\n5. The “Sales Expenses” (i.e. selling expenses) entries are summed separately (again, over several rows) to get roughly 402,408.35.\n\n6. The “Depreciation” transaction (here a single record) contributes 45,760.13.\n\n7. The “Financial Expenses” are obtained by summing all expense lines labelled “Financial Expenses” and come to about 100,008.48.\n\n8. Total Expenses is then the sum of Administrative, Selling, Depreciation and Financial expenses – here 219,307.60 + 402,408.35 + 45,760.13 + 100,008.48 ≈ 767,484.56.\n\n9. The “Interest Receivables” (i.e. interest income) are all added from many small entries (each on the order of a few hundred) and total approximately 11,346.23.\n\n10. Profit Before Tax is Gross Profit less Total Expenses plus Interest Income (2,644,227.00 – 767,484.56 + 11,346.23 ≈ 1,888,088.67).\n\n11. In a sample tax treatment (for example 20% of profit before tax) the tax expense comes out to roughly 377,617.73; subtracting tax gives a Net Profit of about 1,510,470.94.\n\nBecause the table contains many individual transaction lines the above numbers have been “rolled‐up” by type – note that alternative methods of aggregating a real ERP ledger might yield slightly different totals. This is one acceptable complete income statement solution based on the provided data.\n",
