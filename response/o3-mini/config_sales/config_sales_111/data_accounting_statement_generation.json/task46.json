In our data only the “Initial” records with “Cash deposit” and “Bank deposit” supply amounts that immediately affect available cash. (The “Fixed Assets” record does not count as cash even though it is an “initial” record.) \n\nThus, the beginning cash balance is simply:\n\n  Cash deposit = 3,000,000.00  \n  Bank deposit = 5,000,000.00  \n\nSo the total beginning cash and cash equivalents equals 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 8,000,000.00\n\nOther later transactions (purchases, expenses, sales, etc.) are recorded during the period and affect the subsequent cash balance but do not change the opening (or “beginning”) cash figure used in the cash flow statement.\n\nThus the final “Beginning Balance” is 8000000.00.\n\nThe answer is therefore:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\"}\n}",
