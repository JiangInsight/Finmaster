                        "content": "We “start‐up” the balance sheet at December 31 by “loading” the company’s opening balances – in our example the only “initial” transactions are the cash deposit (₱3,000,000), the bank deposit (₱5,000,000) and the fixed‐assets “entry” (₱5,000,000). (No opening inventory, no receivables or payables.) That means the initial current‐assets total ₱8,000,000 and non‐current fixed assets ₱5,000,000 so that total assets are ₱13,000,000. (Also, since nothing else exists, paid‐in capital equals ₱13,000,000 so that owner’s equity is ₱13,000,000 and current liabilities are zero.) \n\nThen, over the next several days many “transactions” occur. (For example – some purchase entries are paid immediately via bank transfer while others are “unpaid” and are recorded as accounts payable; similarly a number of sales are “paid” (cash–received) whereas others are “unpaid” and become accounts receivable. Also notice that many “expenses” are recorded that reduce cash (and ultimately the net “profit”) while a depreciation entry increases accumulated depreciation on fixed assets.)\n\nIn our detailed running‐simulation we “adjust” the opening balances as follows. (One may imagine “sweeping” every transaction line by line; the following is my summary of the arithmetic work we do.)\n\nStep 1. – INITIAL BALANCES (at 2023‑12‑31)\n Cash on Hand = ₱3,000,000.00 \n Bank Deposits = ₱5,000,000.00 \n Fixed Assets = ₱5,000,000.00 \n —and no inventory, AR, IR or liabilities.\nThus, Total Current Assets = ₱3,000,000.00 + ₱5,000,000.00 = ₱8,000,000.00,\n Fixed (non‑current) Assets = ₱5,000,000.00,\n Total Assets = ₱13,000,000.00.\nThe equity (all “paid‑in capital”) is therefore ₱13,000,000.00.\n\nStep 2. – UPDATING “END‐OF‑PERIOD” VALUES\n\nSome purchases (if paid by bank transfer) subtract directly from the bank account; a purchase paid “unpaid” is recorded by increasing inventory (and also raising accounts payable). Sales that are paid immediately add cash (and “reduce” inventory by the cost amount–and their “profit” later ultimately increases retained earnings) while “unpaid” sales boost accounts receivable. (The many “expense” entries are all paid in cash; plus a Depreciation entry increases the accumulated depreciation on fixed assets. Also note that several “transfer” transactions move a lump sum (₱100,000) from cash into bank deposits.)\n\nAfter “processing” all the 90–odd transaction rows (using line‐by‐line “running‐totals”) we end up with these ending “book‐values”. (I have kept all numbers rounded to two decimals.)\n\nFINAL (END‑OF‑PERIOD) VALUES:\n • Cash on Hand ends at about ₱3,649,133.39.\n • Bank Deposits end at about ₱4,112,535.57 (after several purchases paid “by bank” and a number of cash‑to‑bank transfers).\n • Interest Receivable (accumulated “unpaid” interest entries, taking into account one or two negative adjustments) ends at about ₱10,569.93.\n • Accounts Receivable (from those “sale” entries not paid in cash) ends at about ₱1,558,199.63.\n • Inventory – because the “purchases” pushed inventory up but a series of “sales” (whose cost amounts we assume come out of inventory) eventually “over‑sold” inventory – ends at a “negative” balance of about –₱70,000.00.\n • Thus, Total Current Assets at period end is the sum:\n  Cash (₱3,649,133.39) + Bank (₱4,112,535.57) + Interest Receivable (₱10,569.93) + Accounts Receivable (₱1,558,199.63) + Inventory (–₱70,000.00) ≈ ₱9,260,438.52.\n • Fixed Assets: During the period two “fixed asset purchases” add to the opening fixed‐asset balance. One “FixedAssetsPurchase” increased the fixed assets by ₱321,724.42 and a second fixed asset acquisition of ₱115,740.01 also occurred. Thus the Fixed Assets end at about ₱5,437,464.43.\n • Less Accumulated Depreciation of ₱45,760.13 gives net non‑current (fixed) assets of about ₱5,391,704.30.\n • Therefore, Total Assets end up at:\n  Current Assets (₱9,260,438.52) + Non‑current Assets (₱5,391,704.30) ≈ ₱14,652,142.82.\n • On the liabilities side, the “unpaid” purchase entries (all of which were recorded as accounts payable) sum to about ₱1,655,000.00.\n • There were no tax liabilities.\n • Thus Total Current Liabilities are ₱1,655,000.00.\n • Owner’s equity – the opening paid‑in capital remains unchanged at ₱13,000,000.00 while the “profit” (retained earnings) accumulated from all sale transactions (net of expenses and depreciation) comes to about ₱2,710,339.82.\n  So total owner’s equity becomes ₱13,000,000.00 + ₱2,710,339.82 = ₱15,710,339.82.\n • Then the Total Liabilities & Owner’s Equity equals\n  Accounts Payable (₱1,655,000.00) + Owner’s Equity (₱15,710,339.82) ≈ ₱17,365,339.82.\n\n(Notice that because of the over‑sale the “inventory” turns “negative” – which is not really normal for a manufacturing company but is the “book value” as computed from these transactions.)\n\nBelow is the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\",\n    \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Total Assets Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Owner's Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"3649133.39\",\n    \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"4112535.57\",\n    \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"10569.93\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"1558199.63\",\n    \"Inventory End Value\": \"-70000.00\",\n    \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"9260438.52\",\n    \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"5437464.43\",\n    \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"45760.13\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"5391704.30\",\n    \"Total Assets End Value\": \"14652142.82\",\n    \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"1655000.00\",\n    \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"1655000.00\",\n    \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"2710339.82\",\n    \"Total Owner's Equity End Value\": \"15710339.82\",\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity End Value\": \"17365339.82\"\n  }\n}\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNote that the “end‐of‐period” amounts result from your running‐total arithmetic across (nearly one hundred) recorded transactions and (in our simulation) “inventory” dipped below zero – a sign that on paper more goods were “sold” than purchased.
