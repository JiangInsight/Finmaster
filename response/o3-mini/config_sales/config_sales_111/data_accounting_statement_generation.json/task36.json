                        "content": "We can “build” the net–profit number by “adding up” all revenues from sales (the “profit” column on the Sale records) and any “other income” (here the Interest‐Receivable items) and then “subtracting” from that the outlay represented by all the Expense records plus any “non–cash–expense” such as Depreciation. (Items such as the Initial, Purchases, Fixed–Asset acquisitions and Transfers affect the balance sheet but do not enter the P&L.) \n\nIn our example data the idea is to do the following steps:\n\n1. Sum the “profit” amounts on every record whose “type” is “Sale.” (For example, one Sale row shows a profit of 44,707.68; another “Sale” row shows 10,578.75; and so on. When these many “Sale” records are summed we get approximately 2,615,023.09.)\n\n2. Sum the “Interest Receivables” (only those records with type “Interest Receivables” that are not “negative”). In our data these add up to about 11,346.23.\n\n3. Then sum all the Expense–records (that is, all the Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses and Financial Expenses) – in our data the total is about 1,192,342.43.\n\n4. Also subtract the (non–cash) Depreciation amount (here 45,760.13).\n\nThus, the net profit is calculated as\n\n  Net Profit = (Sum of Sale profits) + (Sum of Interest Receivables) − (Sum of Expenses) − (Depreciation)\n       = 2,615,023.09 + 11,346.23 − 1,192,342.43 − 45,760.13 \n       ≈ 1,388,266.76\n\nWhen we round to two decimals the final answer is 1,388,266.76.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"1388266.76\"}}\n``` \n\n(Notice that the step‐by–step “book–keeping” involves going record–by–record and identifying the revenue (the “profit” field on the Sale rows) and adding the Interest amounts while subtracting all Expense items and Depreciation.)",
