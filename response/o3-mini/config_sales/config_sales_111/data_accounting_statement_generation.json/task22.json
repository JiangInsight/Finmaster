In the provided list the “Sale…” transactions show the revenue that the company earned from customers. (Other types such as Purchase, Expense, etc. do not count toward revenue.)\n\nBelow we describe roughly our working steps (“reasoning”):\n\n1. We went through the list and selected every row marked with a type beginning with “Sale” (the identifiers start “SaleYYYYMMDD…”) and noted the “amount” figure from that row. (That amount field is used as the revenue amount for that sale.)\n\n2. We then added together each of those sale amounts. For example, the first few were:\n  • Sale20240102003: 104707.68  \n  • Sale20240102004: 25578.75  \n  • Sale20240102005: 25862.64  \n  … and so on through all the “Sale” rows.\n\n3. After carefully summing each “Sale” transaction (there are many sales lines in the list) we obtained the overall total revenue equal to 6,044,349.38.\n\nThus the final “Total Revenue” item (for the income statement) is 6,044,349.38.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required json format:\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Revenue\": \"6044349.38\"} }",
