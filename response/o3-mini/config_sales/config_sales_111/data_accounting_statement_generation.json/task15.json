                        "content": "We must identify which transactions create liabilities. In our chart the only “liability‐creating” transactions are purchases recorded as “Unpaid” (and their payment method is “Account Payable”). Notice that the “Initial” entries are strictly asset‐related, so they do not add to liabilities. Reviewing each Purchase transaction:\n\n• ID Purchase20231231001 is “Paid” (so no liability).\n• Purchase20231231002 is “Unpaid” – its amount is 60,000.0.\n• Purchase20231231003 is “Unpaid” – its amount is 60,000.0.\n• Purchase20231231004 is “Unpaid” – its amount is 100,000.0.\n• Purchase20231231005 is “Unpaid” – its amount is 45,000.0.\n• Purchase20231231006 is “Paid” (ignore).\n• Purchase20231231007 is “Paid” (ignore).\n• Purchase20231231008 is “Unpaid” – its amount is 20,000.0.\n• Purchase20231231009 is “Unpaid” – its amount is 160,000.0.\n• Purchase20231231010 is “Unpaid” – its amount is 250,000.0.\n• Purchase20231231011 is “Paid” (ignore).\n• Purchase20231231012 is “Unpaid” – its amount is 140,000.0.\n• Purchase20231231013 is “Paid” (ignore).\n• Purchase20231231014 is “Unpaid” – its amount is 30,000.0.\n• Purchase20231231015 is “Paid” (ignore).\n• Purchase20231231016 is “Paid” (ignore).\n• Purchase20231231017 is “Paid” (ignore).\n• Purchase20231231018 is “Unpaid” – its amount is 150,000.0.\n• Purchase20231231019 is “Unpaid” – its amount is 200,000.0.\n• Purchase20231231020 is “Paid” (ignore).\n• Purchase20231231021 is “Paid” (ignore).\n• Purchase20231231022 is “Unpaid” – its amount is 45,000.0.\n• Purchase20231231023 and Purchase20231231024 are “Paid” so ignored.\n\nAdding up the amounts for the “Unpaid” purchase transactions we have:\n 60,000 + 60,000 = 120,000  \n 120,000 + 100,000 = 220,000  \n 220,000 + 45,000 = 265,000  \n 265,000 + 20,000 = 285,000  \n 285,000 + 160,000 = 445,000  \n 445,000 + 250,000 = 695,000  \n 695,000 + 140,000 = 835,000  \n 835,000 + 30,000 = 865,000  \n 865,000 + 150,000 = 1,015,000  \n 1,015,000 + 200,000 = 1,215,000  \n 1,215,000 + 45,000 = 1,260,000  \n\nThere are no liability entries included in the initial transactions so the initial liabilities total is 0.00.\n\nThus, the balance‐sheet “Total Liabilities” at the end is 1,260,000.00.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', 'Total Liabilities End Value': '1260000.00'} }",
