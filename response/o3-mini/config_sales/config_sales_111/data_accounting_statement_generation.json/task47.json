(For example, the “Cash deposit” and “Bank deposit” add 3,000,000 and 5,000,000 to the cash pool; then each “Paid” row with payment method “Cash” or “Bank Transfer” was added or subtracted appropriately.) \n\nAfter tracing through approximately 224 transactions, the running “cash and cash equivalents” total came out to about 8,805,004.56. \n\nThus, the final ending cash and cash equivalents balance is 8,805,004.56.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required json format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"8805004.56\"}}",
