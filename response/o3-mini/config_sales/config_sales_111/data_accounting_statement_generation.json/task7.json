In our data there are two such transactions:\n\n1. A FixedAsset20231231001 row with:\n  amount = 321724.42  \n  (asset_name “Processing Equipment4”, asset_type “Processing Equipment”)\n\n2. Another FixedAsset20231231001 row with:\n  amount = 115740.01 \n  (asset_name “Production Line5”, asset_type “Production Line”)\n\nWe add these two purchase amounts:  \n  321724.42 + 115740.01 = 437464.43\n\nThen the Fixed Assets ending value is the initial fixed assets added by the new purchases:\n  5000000.00 + 437464.43 = 5437464.43\n\nNote that even though a Depreciation transaction is present, in our balance‐sheet “fixed assets” item (at least as it is recorded in the problem) we consider the purchase additions on top of the initial cost.\n\nThus our answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"5437464.43\"\n  }\n}",
