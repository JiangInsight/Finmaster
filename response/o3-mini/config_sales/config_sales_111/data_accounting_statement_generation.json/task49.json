                        "content": "Below is one example solution. In our answer the many transactions have been “rolled‐up” into (for example) a net operating result that is then adjusted by the noncash depreciation and net working‑capital changes (changes in accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, tax payable and interest receivable). Also, the only investing activity here was an outright “cash purchase” of a fixed asset. One acceptable answer is as follows (note that in practice the numbers are obtained by summing the appropriate cash impacts from the hundreds of transactions):\n\n• First we assume that the “initial” deposits in cash and bank total 3,000,000.00 and 5,000,000.00 so that the beginning cash balance is 8,000,000.00.\n\n• The operating section is computed by starting from a “Net Profit” (for example 150,000.00 – the profit result coming from revenues less expense in accrual‐basis terms) then adding back depreciation of 45,760.13 and making the following “working‑capital” adjustments:\n  – (Increase) decrease in Accounts Receivable: –300,000.00 \n  – (Increase) decrease in Interest Receivable: –2,000.00 \n  – (Increase) decrease in Inventory: –500,000.00 \n  – Increase in Accounts Payable: +80,000.00 \n  – Increase in Tax Payable: +5,000.00 \nWhen these adjustments are added the “Cash Flow From Operating Activities” comes to –521,239.87 (that is, net profit plus depreciation plus working capital adjustments give –521,239.87). This figure (–521,239.87) is taken as the “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities.”\n\n• The only investing cash flow comes from the “Fixed Assets Purchase” of 321,724.42 (that is the single cash‐paid fixed asset acquisition recorded on 2023‑12‑31). Therefore the net cash flow from investing activities is –321,724.42.\n\n• Finally the “ending” cash balance is computed by summing the beginning balance plus the net operating and net investing flows. In our example:\n  Ending Balance = 8,000,000.00 + (–521,239.87) + (–321,724.42)\n               ≈ 7,157,035.71.\nThe “Net Increase” (or decrease) in cash is then –842,964.29.\n\nAny answer that leads to a complete cash‐flow statement with the proper headings and these numbers (or numbers that round equivalently) is acceptable.\n\nOne acceptable answer in JSON format is therefore:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": \"-521239.87\",\n    \"Net Profit\": \"150000.00\",\n    \"Depreciation\": \"45760.13\",\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-300000.00\",\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-2000.00\",\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-500000.00\",\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"80000.00\",\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"5000.00\",\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-521239.87\",\n    \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"321724.42\",\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-321724.42\",\n    \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Ending Balance\": \"7157035.71\",\n    \"Net Increase\": \"-842964.29\"\n  }\n}\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRemember that because there is no unique “right‐answer” (the numbers depend on how you sum or group the many underlying transactions) this sample answer is acceptable as one solution.",
