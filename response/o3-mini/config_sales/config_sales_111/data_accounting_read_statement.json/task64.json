From the balance sheet, the “capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares” is found at the “Paid-in Capital” line (end value).\n2. From the income statement, the “profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense” is the “Profit Before Tax” line.\n3. Also from the balance sheet, the “addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period” is the “Accounts Payable” line.\n\nUsing the new problem statements:\n• In the balance sheet, “Paid-in Capital” End_amount = 13000000.00.\n• In the income statement, “Profit Before Tax” = 1393266.97.\n• In the balance sheet, “Accounts Payable” End_amount = 1260000.00.\n\nFollowing the sample solution’s ordering (first Paid-in Capital, then Profit Before Tax, then Accounts Payable) the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value1\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"value2\": \"1393266.97\",\n    \"value3\": \"1260000.00\"\n  }\n}",
