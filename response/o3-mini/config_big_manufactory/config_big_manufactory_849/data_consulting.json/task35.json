                        "content": "Let's calculate each metric step by step:\n\n1. Current Ratio  \n Formula: Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \n From the balance sheet:  \n  Total Current Assets = 23,990,150.22  \n  Total Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82  \n Calculation: 23,990,150.22 ÷ 4,319,436.82 ≈ 5.55  \n\n2. Gross Profit Margin  \n Formula: Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%  \n From the income statement:  \n  Gross Profit = 4,788,736.33  \n  Total Revenue = 16,388,736.33  \n Calculation: (4,788,736.33 ÷ 16,388,736.33) × 100 ≈ 29.23%  \n\n3. Debt to Asset Ratio  \n Formula: Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets  \n Assuming that Total Liabilities is given by Total Current Liabilities (since no non-current liabilities are provided):  \n  Total Liabilities = 4,319,436.82  \n  Total Assets = 33,610,271.98  \n Calculation: 4,319,436.82 ÷ 33,610,271.98 ≈ 0.13  \n\n4. Net Profit Margin  \n Formula: Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%  \n From the income statement:  \n  Net Profit = 1,290,835.16  \n  Total Revenue = 16,388,736.33  \n Calculation: (1,290,835.16 ÷ 16,388,736.33) × 100 ≈ 7.88%  \n\n5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio  \n Formula: Cash to Current Debt Ratio = (Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits) / Total Current Liabilities  \n From the balance sheet:  \n  Cash on Hand = 9,383,594.56  \n  Bank Deposits = 2,573,984.92  \n  Sum = 9,383,594.56 + 2,573,984.92 = 11,957,579.48  \n  Total Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82  \n Calculation: 11,957,579.48 ÷ 4,319,436.82 ≈ 2.77  \n\n6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)  \n Formula: FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities – Capital Expenditures  \n From the cash flow statement:  \n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –6,316,405.44  \n  Purchase of Fixed Assets (Capital Expenditures) = 1,726,015.08  \n Calculation: –6,316,405.44 – 1,726,015.08 = –8,042,420.52  \n\n7. Return on Assets (ROA)  \n Formula: ROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) × 100%  \n From the provided data:  \n  Net Profit = 1,290,835.16  \n  Total Assets = 33,610,271.98  \n Calculation: (1,290,835.16 ÷ 33,610,271.98) × 100 ≈ 3.84%  \n\nNow, formatting our answers in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"5.55\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"29.23%\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.13\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"7.88%\",\n    \"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"2.77\",\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-8042420.52\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"3.84%\"\n  }\n}",
