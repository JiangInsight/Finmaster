                        "content": "We first compute the two ratios from the provided statements using the figure at the “End” date.\n\n1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated as:\n  Total Liabilities ÷ Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet at the end date:\n  Total Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 3,500,000.00 + 819,436.82 = 4,319,436.82  \n  Total Assets = 33,610,271.98\n\nThus,\n  Debt to Asset Ratio = 4,319,436.82 ÷ 33,610,271.98 ≈ 0.1285  \nRounded to two decimal places, this is approximately 0.13.\n\n2. Net Cash Ratio\n\nIn the sample answer the second ratio was given as the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio. We follow the same approach here by taking the Operating Cash Flow from Operating Activities and dividing it by Net Profit (using the sign convention as provided).\n\nFrom the cash flow and income statement:\n  Operating Cash Flow (from Operating Activities) = –6,316,405.44  \n  Net Profit = 1,290,835.16\n\nThen,\n  Net Cash Ratio = (–6,316,405.44) ÷ 1,290,835.16 ≈ –4.892\n\nRounded to two decimal places, this is –4.89.\n\nThus, the solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.13\",\n    \"Net Cash Ratio\": \"-4.89\"\n  }\n}",
