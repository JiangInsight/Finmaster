                        "content": "We start by noting that Free Cash Flow (FCF) is typically calculated as the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities minus the capital expenditures (in this case, the Purchase of Fixed Assets). So the formula is:\n\n  FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities – Purchase of Fixed Assets\n\nFrom the problem data:\n\n• Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,316,405.44  \n• Purchase of Fixed Assets = 1,726,015.08  \n\nCalculate FCF:\n  FCF = -6,316,405.44 - 1,726,015.08 = -8,042,420.52\n\nThus, the computed Free Cash Flow (FCF) is -8,042,420.52.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested json format:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-8042420.52'} }",
