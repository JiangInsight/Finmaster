                        "content": "We first need to interpret which formulas to use. In the example the “Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio” is computed (even though the task calls it the “Net Cash Ratio”). Similarly, the “Current Assets Turnover Ratio” is obtained by dividing Total Revenue by the average current assets, and the “Quick Ratio” is computed by taking the “quick assets” (cash and equivalents, interest receivable, plus accounts receivable) divided by current liabilities. For clarity, here are the formulas we use:\n\n1. Net Cash Ratio = Operating CF from operating activities / Net Profit  \n  • (Use the numbers from the cash flow and income statement.)\n\n2. Turnover Ratio (Current Assets Turnover Ratio) = Total Revenue / Average Current Assets  \n  • Average Current Assets = (Initial Current Assets + End Current Assets) / 2\n\n3. Quick Ratio = (Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities\n\nNow we apply these to our problem:\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 1. Net Cash Ratio  \n• From Cash Flow statement:  \n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –6,316,405.44  \n• From Income Statement:  \n  Net Profit = 1,290,835.16  \nThus,  \n  Net Cash Ratio = –6,316,405.44 / 1,290,835.16 ≈ –4.89\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 2. Turnover Ratio (Current Assets Turnover Ratio)  \n• From Balance Sheet:  \n  Initial Current Assets = 20,000,000.00  \n  End Current Assets = 23,990,150.22  \nAverage Current Assets = (20,000,000.00 + 23,990,150.22) / 2  \n    = 43,990,150.22 / 2  \n    ≈ 21,995,075.11  \n• From Income Statement:  \n  Total Revenue = 16,388,736.33  \nThus,  \n  Current Assets Turnover Ratio = 16,388,736.33 / 21,995,075.11 ≈ 0.75\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 3. Quick Ratio  \n• Quick Assets are calculated by summing:  \n  Cash on Hand = 9,383,594.56  \n  Bank Deposits = 2,573,984.92  \n  Interest Receivable = 23,583.67  \n  Accounts Receivable = 6,408,987.07  \nSum = 9,383,594.56 + 2,573,984.92 = 11,957,579.48  \n  Then add Interest Receivable: 11,957,579.48 + 23,583.67 = 11,981,163.15  \n  Then add Accounts Receivable: 11,981,163.15 + 6,408,987.07 ≈ 18,390,150.22  \n• From Balance Sheet:  \n  Total Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82  \nThus,  \n  Quick Ratio = 18,390,150.22 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ 4.26\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nThus, our three calculated ratios are:  \nNet Cash Ratio: –4.89  \nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio: 0.75  \nQuick Ratio: 4.26\n\nWe now present the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Ratio\": \"-4.89\", \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.75\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"4.26\"}}",
