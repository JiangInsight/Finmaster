Thus the Average Accounts Receivable is:\n  (0.00 + 6,408,987.07) / 2 = 3,204,493.535\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n  16,388,736.33 / 3,204,493.535 ≈ 5.11\n\nThus, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is approximately 5.11.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"5.11\"\n  }\n}",
