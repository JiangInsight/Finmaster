In the sample, both numbers were negative so that a division resulted in a positive ratio:\n  Ratio = (–7,259,994.10) ÷ (–1,645,141.43) ≈ 4.41\n\nStep 2: For the new problem we have:\n • Net Profit = 1,290,835.16 \n • Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –6,316,405.44\n\nStep 3: Compute the ratio:\n  Ratio = (–6,316,405.44) ÷ (1,290,835.16) ≈ –4.89\n\nThus, the Net Cash Ratio (calculated as Operating Cash Flow ÷ Net Profit) is approximately –4.89.\n\nThe result in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Ratio\": \"-4.89\"}}",
