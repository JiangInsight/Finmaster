                        "content": "We begin by extracting the key end‐period numbers from the balance sheet, cash flow statement and income statement.\n\nStep 1. Identify relevant items:\n• Current Liabilities: From the balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\n• Total Owner’s Equity: 29,290,835.16\n• (Total) Debt: Since there is no additional noncurrent liability provided, “Total Debt” is taken as Total Liabilities, which from the balance sheet equals 4,319,436.82 (because Total Assets – Total Owner’s Equity = 33,610,271.98 – 29,290,835.16 = 4,319,436.82).\n• Current Assets: Total Current Assets = 23,990,150.22\n• Inventory: Inventory = 5,600,000.00\n• Cost of Goods Sold: From the income statement = 11,600,000.00\n• Operating Cash Flow: From the cash flow statement, net cash flow from operating activities = –6,316,405.44\n\nStep 2. Compute the ratios.\n\nA. Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n  = –6,316,405.44 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ –1.46\n\nB. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt  \n  Since Total Debt = 4,319,436.82, the ratio is the same as above  \n  = –6,316,405.44 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ –1.46\n\nC. Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Inventory  \n  = 11,600,000.00 / 5,600,000.00 ≈ 2.07\n\nD. Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity  \n  = 4,319,436.82 / 29,290,835.16 ≈ 0.15\n\nE. Quick Ratio = (Current Assets – Inventory) / Current Liabilities  \n  = (23,990,150.22 – 5,600,000.00) / 4,319,436.82  \n  = 18,390,150.22 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ 4.26\n\nF. Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \n  = 23,990,150.22 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ 5.55\n\nStep 3. Present the results rounded to two decimals:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.46\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-1.46\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"2.07\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.15\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"4.26\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"5.55\"\n  }\n}",
