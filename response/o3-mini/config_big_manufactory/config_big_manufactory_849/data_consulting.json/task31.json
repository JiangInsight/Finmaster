                        "content": "Step 1. Calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio.  \n• Formula: Accounts Receivable Turnover = Sales / Average Accounts Receivable.  \n• From the income statement, Sales (Main Business Revenue) = 16,388,736.33.  \n• From the balance sheet, Accounts Receivable at the beginning is 0.00 and at the end is 6,408,987.07.  \n• Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 6,408,987.07) / 2 = 3,204,493.535.  \n• Ratio = 16,388,736.33 / 3,204,493.535 ≈ 5.11.\n\nStep 2. Calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratios.  \nBoth “operating cash flow ratio” and “operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio” use the same formula:  \n• Formula: Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities.  \n• From the cash flow statement, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –6,316,405.44.  \n• From the balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities at the end = 4,319,436.82.  \n• Ratio = –6,316,405.44 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ –1.46.\n\nStep 3. Calculate the Total Asset Turnover Ratio.  \n• Formula: Total Asset Turnover = Sales / Average Total Assets.  \n• From the income statement, Sales = 16,388,736.33.  \n• From the balance sheet, Total Assets: Initial = 28,000,000.00 and End = 33,610,271.98.  \n• Average Total Assets = (28,000,000.00 + 33,610,271.98) / 2 ≈ 30,805,135.99.  \n• Ratio = 16,388,736.33 / 30,805,135.99 ≈ 0.53.\n\nStep 4. Calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio.  \n• Formula: Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity.  \n• From the balance sheet, Total Liabilities can be determined by subtracting Owner's Equity from Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity.  \n  Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity (End) = 33,610,271.98  \n  Owner’s Equity (End) = 29,290,835.16  \n  Thus, Total Liabilities = 33,610,271.98 − 29,290,835.16 = 4,319,436.82.  \n• Ratio = 4,319,436.82 / 29,290,835.16 ≈ 0.15.\n\nThus, the final solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"5.11\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-1.46\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.46\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.53\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.15\"\n  }\n}",
