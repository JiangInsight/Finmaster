According to the task description and the provided examples, we need to find the line item that represents the income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities and the line item that represents the carrying amount of inventories sold. \n2. In an income statement, \"Main Business Revenue\" represents the income from the entity's core operating activities, while \"Cost of Goods Sold\" represents the carrying amount of inventories sold.\n3. Looking at the provided data, the values are:\n   - Main Business Revenue: 16388736.33\n   - Cost of Goods Sold: 11600000.00\n4. Therefore, we assign value1 to the Main Business Revenue and value2 to the Cost of Goods Sold.\n\nThe final answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16388736.33', 'value2': '11600000.00'} }\n```",
