                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” the result by remembering that in a simple accounting system the balance‐sheet “equation” always holds:\n\n  Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity\n\nIf the business began with certain “initial” resources the balance–sheet “initial value” of owners’ equity (plus any liabilities) is given by the sum of the “Initial” transactions. In our sample problem the three “Initial” transactions were a Cash deposit of 5,000,000, a Bank deposit of 15,000,000 and Fixed Assets of 8,000,000. (Here we assume that these initial entries represent the entire “capital” injection so that the initial liabilities+owners’ equity equals 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 28,000,000.)\n\nThen during the operating period many transactions occur. In our fairly “asset‐and‐expense”–oriented system one may think of the “net income” that is “generated” during the period as “increasing” owners’ equity (so that at the end the balance–sheet total for Liabilities+Owners’ Equity is the beginning balance plus the net profit).\n\nIn our new problem the only “profit” information that is already computed appears on the sale transactions. (For example, one Sale shows a profit of 248087.14; another gives 646535.22; and so on.) When we add up all the “profit” figures that have been recorded on the various Sale rows we get approximately\n\n  4,788,736.33\n\nIn addition, several “Interest Receivables” transactions – recorded in separate rows – add non–operating income. (For example, one Interest row shows 1201.50; another 1078.13; many others appear with amounts roughly 935.73, 846.73, 704.33, 615.33, 570.83, 437.33 or 229.08. When you add all such interest–amounts the total comes out near 22,968.34.) In a “complete” net–income number these interest revenues would be added as well. (They have not been “restated” as separate profit numbers so we must add them in now.) Altogether then the period’s net income is about\n\n  4,788,736.33 + 22,968.34 ≈ 4,811,704.67\n\nThat net income is “added” to the beginning owners’ equity (with no other owner withdrawals or contributions occurring) so that at period–end the total “liabilities and owners’ equity” equals\n\n  28,000,000.00 + 4,811,704.67 ≈ 32,811,704.67\n\nThus, in our new problem the totals come out as follows:\n\nInitial Total Liabilities and Owners’ Equity: 28,000,000.00\nEnd–of–period Total Liabilities and Owners’ Equity: 32,811,704.67\n\nWe now present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"32811704.67\"\n  }\n}\n\n────────────────────────────\n\nNote: Because the transactions are many and many affect (in different ways) assets and equity, one common way is to “net” the recorded sale “profit” and add any additional non–operating income (here the interest receivables) to the initial balance. (Other items like purchases and depreciation move assets but – if the purchase is offset by an equal increase in liabilities or inventory – do not affect total liabilities plus equity.) This “back–of–the–envelope” calculation is consistent with the sample answer provided.",
