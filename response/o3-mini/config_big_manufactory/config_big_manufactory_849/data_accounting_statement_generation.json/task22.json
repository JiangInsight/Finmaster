                        "content": "We need to “extract” from the full table only the transactions that have type equal to \"Sale\" (because those represent revenue‐earning operations) and then sum the amounts that are reported in the “after_tax_amount” column. (Typically, in an income statement “total revenue” comes from the sales “after tax” receipts.) Notice that other types of transactions (like purchases, expenses, interest, etc.) are not “revenue”; they are either cost or non‐operating items.\n\nBelow is our step‐by‐step calculation.\n\nStep 1. Identify the rows with type = \"Sale\". In our many rows the following records (by id and “after_tax_amount”) are “Sale” transactions:\n\n1. Sale20240106004 – after_tax_amount = 710,682.78  \n2. Sale20240108006 – after_tax_amount = 2,039,208.46  \n3. Sale20240111008 – after_tax_amount = 1,093,769.80  \n4. Sale20240114010 – after_tax_amount = 658,868.95  \n5. Sale20240119016 – after_tax_amount = 1,280,664.77  \n6. Sale20240122019 – after_tax_amount = 659,924.83  \n7. Sale20240123021 – after_tax_amount = 1,022,251.53  \n8. Sale20240124022 – after_tax_amount = 643,496.33  \n9. Sale20240125024 – after_tax_amount = 2,100,055.92  \n10. Sale20240126025 – after_tax_amount = 628,501.63  \n11. Sale20240130031 – after_tax_amount = 1,418,227.07  \n12. Sale20240131033 – after_tax_amount = 681,971.04  \n13. Sale20240202035 – after_tax_amount = 627,921.21  \n14. Sale20240204038 – after_tax_amount = 2,003,755.19\n\nStep 2. Sum these after‑tax amounts.\n\nFor clarity we add them one by one (all figures are in monetary units):\n\n• After first two:\n  710,682.78 + 2,039,208.46 ≈ 2,749,891.24\n\n• Add the 3rd:\n  2,749,891.24 + 1,093,769.80 = 3,843,661.04\n\n• Add the 4th:\n  3,843,661.04 + 658,868.95 = 4,502,529.99\n\n• Add the 5th:\n  4,502,529.99 + 1,280,664.77 = 5,783,194.76\n\n• Add the 6th:\n  5,783,194.76 + 659,924.83 = 6,443,119.59\n\n• Add the 7th:\n  6,443,119.59 + 1,022,251.53 = 7,465,371.12\n\n• Add the 8th:\n  7,465,371.12 + 643,496.33 = 8,108,867.45\n\n• Add the 9th:\n  8,108,867.45 + 2,100,055.92 = 10,208,923.37\n\n• Add the 10th:\n  10,208,923.37 + 628,501.63 = 10,837,425.00\n\n• Add the 11th:\n  10,837,425.00 + 1,418,227.07 = 12,255,652.07\n\n• Add the 12th:\n  12,255,652.07 + 681,971.04 = 12,937,623.11\n\n• Add the 13th:\n  12,937,623.11 + 627,921.21 = 13,565,544.32\n\n• Add the 14th:\n  13,565,544.32 + 2,003,755.19 = 15,569,299.51\n\nThus, the sum of all “after_tax_amount” values for the “Sale” transactions is roughly 15,569,299.51.\n\nStep 3. We then format that as the “Total Revenue” on the income statement. (For presentation one may round to two decimals.)\n\nTherefore, our final answer is approximately 15,569,299.51.\n\nNow we present the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Total Revenue\": \"15569299.51\"}\n}",
