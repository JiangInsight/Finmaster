                        "content": "We need to determine the cash‐flow “outlay” specifically for acquiring fixed assets. In our dataset the initial “Fixed Assets” entry (with an amount of 8,000,000.0) is an opening balance and not a purchase during the period. Instead, the “purchase” transactions for new fixed assets are recorded with a type that explicitly indicates a fixed asset acquisition (in our case, the rows whose “type” is “Fixed Assets Purchase”).\n\nLooking carefully at the provided rows, we find exactly two fixed assets purchase transactions:\n\n1. The row with id “FixedAsset20231231001” (the first one) has:\n  • Type: “Fixed Assets Purchase”\n  • Amount: 886161.25\n\n2. Later in the table (again with id “FixedAsset20231231001”) there is another row with:\n  • Type: “Fixed Assets Purchase”\n  • Amount: 839853.83\n\nTo get the final purchase of fixed assets we sum these two amounts:\n  886161.25 + 839853.83 = 1726015.08\n\nThus, the final purchase of fixed assets in the cash flow statement is 1726015.08.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required json format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"1726015.08\"}}\n```",
