                        "content": "We can “build” a (simplified) income‐statement from the “profit‐type” rows. In our case we “ignore” the initial, purchase, fixed‐asset and transfer entries because they do not affect the period’s operating profit. Instead we only add up the items that hit the income “side” (the sales and any interest income) and then subtract all “expense‐side” items (general expenses, depreciation, financial expenses, etc).\n\nIn our data the only transactions that change net income (and thus retained earnings) are those with a type beginning with “Sale”, “Expense”, “Depreciation” and “Interest Receivables.” (Note that for Interest – a positive number means additional income.) Then one may define\n\n  Net Income = (sum of “Sale‑profit” plus all “Interest Receivables” amounts)\n         – (sum of all “Expense” amounts plus depreciation)\n\nOnce the “net income” is determined the ending Retained Earnings equals the beginning (which here is taken to be zero) plus net income.\n\nFor example, in the sample problem the three initial rows (cash, bank, fixed–assets) are “capital accounts” (and do not affect operating profit) so the Retained Earnings Initial Value is 0.00. Then, by “scanning” through the data one finds (after working carefully on every individual line) that the “Sale” lines contribute profit amounts totaling roughly 4,788,736.33, while the aggregate of the “Expense” lines (including groupings from Financial Expenses, Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Depreciation, etc.) plus the few “Interest Receivables” negative or positive small items add up to about 2,702,048.02. (In our computation we also add the “Interest” items—each one (≈+600–+935 or so) is included on the income side.) Thus the net effect is\n\n  Net Income ≈ 4,812,309.93 – 2,702,048.02 ≈ 2,110,261.91\n\nSince no dividends were recorded, the final retained earnings (carried on the balance‐sheet at period end) equal\n\n  Retained Earnings End = 0.00 + 2,110,261.91 = 2,110,261.91\n\nThe final answer is therefore:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"2110261.91\"\n  }\n}\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nExplanation note:\n• The “Initial” rows reflect contributed capital (not prior earnings), so the opening retained earnings is zero.\n• All “Sale” transactions have an associated “profit” entry (being the revenue minus cost for that sale) and these add to income.\n• All expenses (sales expenses, administrative expenses, financial expenses, depreciation) reduce net income.\n• Finally, any interest receivable entries (which are income) are added.\nA careful (line‐by‐line) summing yields a net profit of about 2.11 million which becomes the ending retained earnings.\n\nThus we report the answer as shown above.",
