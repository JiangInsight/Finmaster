                        "content": "We need to identify which transactions add or reduce the “accounts payable” balance. In our case only purchase entries having a payment‐status of “Unpaid” and a payment method of “Account Payable” affect the accounts payable balance. (Any “Purchase” that is settled (paid via Bank Transfer or Cash) does not leave a payable.) \n\nStep‑by‑step reasoning:\n\n1. First look at the “Initial” lines. Those “Initial” transactions (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) establish the starting asset balances. There is no “accounts payable” entry recorded initially so the opening (or initial) accounts payable balance is 0.00.\n\n2. In the rest of the data we only count the purchase transactions where:\n  • the transaction type is “Purchase”\n  • the payment/receipt_status is “Unpaid”\n  • the payment_method is “Account Payable”\n\n3. Scanning the list we find the following two “Purchase” transactions that meet the criteria:\n  a. id = Purchase20231231004 – This purchase has an amount = 3000000.0 and its payment method is “Account Payable” (with status “Unpaid”).\n  b. id = Purchase20231231011 – This purchase has an amount = 500000.0 and it too is “Unpaid” with payment method “Account Payable”.\n\n4. In our period no separate “settlement” (payment) event of these pending purchases appears so they remain on the balance sheet. \n\n5. The closing (final) accounts payable balance is thus the sum of these unpaid purchases:\n  3000000.0 + 500000.0 = 3500000.0\n\n6. As there were no accounts payable carried forward from a previous period (since the initial entries do not include any payable) the initial value is 0.00.\n\nThus, the answer – expressed in the required JSON format – is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"3500000.00\"\n  }\n}\n--------------------------------------------------",
