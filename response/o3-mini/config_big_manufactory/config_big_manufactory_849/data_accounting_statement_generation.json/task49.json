                        "content": "We can “build” a complete cash‐flow statement by first grouping the many transactions into operating versus investing flows. In our (simplified) example the procedure was as follows:\n\n1. (a) The “initial” transactions show that the entity started with two types of cash funds – a cash deposit of 5 000 000 and a bank deposit of 15 000 000. (The “fixed assets” initial record reflects a “contribution in kind” that is not treated as available cash.) Thus we consider the beginning cash and bank ﬂow as 20 000 000.\n\n2. (b) Next we group “operating” transactions. In our data many expense items (sales, administrative and financial expenses) are paid by cash and many “sale” records are received in cash. For example (roughly) one finds that:\n  – The total cash received “from cash sales” adds up to about 9 979 749.26.\n  – The cash‐paid operating expenses (sales expenses, admin and financial expenses) add up to roughly 2 597 000.\nThat “net” (9.98 m − 2.60 m) would be 7.38 m if there were no further working‐capital changes. However, many sale records are not received in cash but “on account”. Their effect is to increase accounts receivable – reducing the cash available. In our example the sum of “unpaid” sales (which are recorded as an increase in accounts receivable) is nearly 6 408 987.07 (a use of cash). Also, several “Interest receivable” records (which are not collected in cash) add a further working–capital use of about 23 583.61. (No operating inventory exists here and no operating payable or tax payable adjustments are observed.) Finally, then the net cash flow from operations becomes roughly\n\n  7.38 m – 6.41 m – 0.024 m ≃ 0.95 m.\n\nSince “net profit” (the sum of the (positive) “profit” amounts that the sale records show) comes in at about 5 397 952.32 and the noncash expense depreciation (from two records – one January and one February) totals about 105 893.32 the “operating work–capital adjustments” must “subtract” the roughly 6.41 m from sales on account plus the interest receivable use (≈23.6 k). When everything is combined we obtain a net cash flow from the Operating Activities on the order of 948 178.19.\n\n3. (c) The “investing” section reflects purchases of fixed assets. (Here we assume that items bought on credit do not cause an immediate cash outlay.) In our data the paid “fixed asset”‐purchases (those paid by bank transfer or cash) add up approximately to\n\n  – 1 500 000 (a purchase of Heavy Equipment D)\n  – 886 161.25 (a fixed–asset purchase record)\n  – 500 000 (purchase of Heavy Equipment A)\n  – 1 600 000 (purchase of Heavy Equipment B)\n  – 1 000 000 (purchase of Heavy Equipment C)\n  – 2 000 000 (a second purchase of Heavy Equipment C)\n  – 1 000 000 (another Heavy Equipment A)\n  – 1 600 000 (a further purchase on Heavy Equipment B)\n  – 1 000 000 (another Heavy Equipment A)\n  – 500 000 (a purchase of Heavy Equipment A)\n  – 1 500 000 (a second purchase of Heavy Equipment D)\n  – 839 853.83 (a fixed assets purchase recorded later)\n  – 500 000 (yet another purchase of Heavy Equipment A)\n  – 1 000 000 (another Heavy Equipment C)\n  – 1 000 000 (another purchase of Heavy Equipment C)\n  \nWhen these “paid” investing items are totaled the result is approximately an outflow of –16 426 015.08.\n\n4. (d) Finally, the overall (net) cash‐flow during the period is obtained by adding the operating net to the (negative) investing net. In our example this “net increase” is\n\n  948 178.19 + (–16 426 015.08) = –15 477 836.89.\n\nWhen one adds the initial cash and bank balance of 20 000 000, the ending cash balance comes to\n\n  20 000 000 + (–15 477 836.89) = 4 522 163.11.\n\nFinally, we then present (using our sample numbers) a complete cash–flow statement in a JSON object. (Note that the “Cash Flow from Investing Activities” field is sometimes given as zero, with the “purchase” line stated separately; we follow the format of the sample provided.)\n\nThe final answer (all numbers rounded to two decimals) is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": \"948178.19\",\n  \"Net Profit\": \"5397952.32\",\n  \"Depreciation\": \"105893.32\",\n  \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-6408987.07\",\n  \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-23583.61\",\n  \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"948178.19\",\n  \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"-16426015.08\",\n  \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-16426015.08\",\n  \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Beginning Balance\": \"20000000.00\",\n  \"Ending Balance\": \"4522163.11\",\n  \"Net Increase\": \"-15477836.89\"\n}\n\nBelow is the JSON answer in the required format. \n\n────────────────────────────────────────\nJSON answer:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": \"948178.19\", \"Net Profit\": \"5397952.32\", \"Depreciation\": \"105893.32\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-6408987.07\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-23583.61\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"0.00\", \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"0.00\", \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"0.00\", \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"948178.19\", \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"-16426015.08\", \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-16426015.08\", \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": \"0.00\", \"Beginning Balance\": \"20000000.00\", \"Ending Balance\": \"4522163.11\", \"Net Increase\": \"-15477836.89\"}}\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\n\nNote:\nBecause the original dataset is very detailed, many approximations have been made and the numbers have been “rolled‐up” into typical working–capital (accounts receivable, interest receivable) and fixed asset purchase totals. (Any “unpaid” purchase is not treated as a cash outlay.) This is one acceptable acceptable interpretation of the working paper data.",
