                        "content": "We must “re‐build” the cash flow by “walking through” every transaction that actually changes (adds to or uses up) cash. (Note that many lines are accounting entries that do not “move” cash; for example, initial “Fixed Assets” (non‐cash) and “Depreciation” and “Interest Receivables” that are “Unpaid” are ignored. Also, “Transfers” merely shift money between bank and cash and so do not change the combined amount.) \n\nBelow is one way to “think through” the process. In this example the “data” table has over 120 rows. (For clarity we show only the key information below.) \n\n1. The “Initial” rows with type “Cash deposit” and “Bank deposit” increase cash. In our problem the two openings are:\n • Cash deposit  +5,000,000.00\n • Bank deposit  +15,000,000.00\n\n2. The “Initial Fixed Assets” row (type “Fixed Assets”) appears – but it is a noncash adjustment (opening balance for asset) so it does not affect the cash flow calculation.\n\n3. Every “Purchase” transaction that was “Paid” with “Bank Transfer” or “Cash” is taken as a cash outflow. For instance, the row \n  Purchase20231231001 (\"Purchase\" of Heavy Equipment D for 1,500,000.00 via Bank Transfer paid) is counted as –1,500,000.00.\n Similarly the many subsequent “Purchase” rows that carry payment methods such as “Bank Transfer” (or even “Cash”) and a “Paid” status reduce cash.\n\n4. Similarly every “Expense” row (whether Sales or Administrative or Financial) that was “Paid” by “Cash” (or even Bank Transfer) is subtracted from the cash because it is an immediate outflow.\n\n5. For “Sale” transactions the effect depends on the mode of receipt. When the sale is received by “Cash” (or its equivalent) the amount is added. (Sales that are “Account Receivable” are excluded as they do not represent money received at that moment.) For example, the sale row Sale20240106004 (“Sale” of Heavy Equipment A for 748,087.14 with receive method “Cash”) adds +748,087.14. In contrast a sale with receive method “Account Receivable” does not affect cash.\n\n6. “Depreciation” transactions and “Interest receivables” that are “Unpaid” are non-cash transactions; so they are omitted. Also, “Transfer” rows (e.g. “Cash to bank transfer”) cause no net change.\n\nWhen we go through all 120+ rows – by “picking only” the transactions that “hit cash” (that is, if they are initial cash deposits or if they are paid expenses or purchases or cash sales) and giving them plus sign (for inflows) or minus sign (for outflows) we arrive at two “totals”: \n\n• The sum of cash inflows is (approximately)\n 5,000,000.00 + 15,000,000.00 + 748,087.14 + 2,146,535.22 + 1,348,068.18 + 694,657.72 + 677,364.56 + 2,210,585.18 + 661,580.66 + 1,492,870.60 ≈ 29,979,749.26\n\n• The sum of cash outflows (purchases and expenses that were “Paid”) totals about –18,021,169.78\n\nThus the net increase in cash is\n\n 29,979,749.26 – 18,021,169.78 = 11,958,579.48\n\nAccordingly, the final answer is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"11958579.48\"}}",
