In our setting the “investing” items are those that reflect purchases (outflows) or sales (inflows) of long‐term assets. (Note that initial noncash “Fixed Assets” do not result in a “cash” flow during the period.) In our list many rows are “Purchase…” or “Fixed Assets Purchase” (together with “Sale…” of heavy equipment) that concern heavy equipment or heavy machinery. We must also “exclude” items that (a) are operating/administrative/expense/interest (b) are not “paid” in cash (for example, if the Payment/Receipt status is “Unpaid” or if the receive method is “Account Receivable”). Then we “sum up” all the cash amounts “paid for” fixed asset purchases (a negative cash impact) and “received” when a fixed asset is sold (a positive cash impact).\n\nLet’s step‐through the list briefly:\n\n────────────────────────────\n1.
