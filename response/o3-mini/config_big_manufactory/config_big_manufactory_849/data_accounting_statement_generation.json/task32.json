                        "content": "We “build” the income‐statement profit by “reading” only those transactions that actually affect the profit–that is, ignoring balance‐sheet events (initial “deposit”, “purchase” and “fixed assets” are not “income statement” items). In our data the following types “flow” into the profit calculation:\n\n• “Sale” rows come with an already–calculated “profit” value (which is essentially the sales revenue minus the cost of goods sold for that sale).  \n• “Interest Receivables” rows are “other income” (even if sometimes “unpaid”) and so they add to income.  \n• “Expense” rows (that is, “Sales Expenses”, “Administrative Expenses” and “Financial Expenses”) and “Depreciation” rows are “cost” items that are subtracted.\n\nOne acceptable method is to “sum” (a) all the sale‑profit values plus interest receivables amounts and then (b) subtract all expense‐type amounts and depreciation. (Other transactions such as “Purchase”, “Fixed Assets” or “Initial” do not affect the P&L.)\n\nAfter carefully “reading through” the new dataset we interpret the following sums:\n\n 1. Sum of all “Sale” profit values (from the Sale rows) came to approximately 4,788,736.33.  \n 2. Sum of all “Interest Receivables” amounts came to approximately 23,483.64.  \n 3. Sum of all “Expense” lines plus “Depreciation” (from Expense and Depreciation rows) came to approximately 2,576,587.09.\n\nThus the “Profit Before Tax” is computed as\n\n  Profit Before Tax = (sales profit + interest income) – (expenses + depreciation)\n            ≈ (4,788,736.33 + 23,483.64) – 2,576,587.09 \n            ≈ 4,812,219.97 – 2,576,587.09 \n            ≈ 2,235,632.88\n\nPresenting the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Profit Before Tax\": \"2235632.88\"}}\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: Because there are many transactions the numbers have been “accumulated” step‐by‑step; small rounding differences may occur. The final computed profit before tax is approximately 2,235,632.88.",
