                        "content": "We need to “build” the ending balance of accounts payable by looking only at transactions that represent purchases that have not yet been paid (that is, those that are recorded as “Unpaid” and (typically) use the “Account Payable” payment method). In our data the only “Purchase”‐type rows that affect accounts payable are those in which the payment/receipt status is Unpaid and the payment_method is “Account Payable.”\n\nStep‑by‑step:\n\n1. Looking over the list we ignore items such as cash deposits, bank deposits, expense items and sales. We concentrate on rows with type “Purchase.”\n\n2. There are several Purchase rows. For each row we check:\n • If its “payment/receipt_status” is Paid then the supplier has been paid already (so no liability remains) and it does not contribute to accounts payable.\n • If its “payment/receipt_status” is Unpaid and its payment_method is “Account Payable” then the purchase is recorded as a liability.\n\n3. Scanning the data we find:\n • Row with id Purchase20231231004: \n  – Type: Purchase\n  – Amount = 3000000.0 \n  – Payment/receipt_status = “Unpaid”\n  – Payment_method = “Account Payable”\n  => This adds 3,000,000.0 to accounts payable.\n • Row with id Purchase20231231011:\n  – Type: Purchase\n  – Amount = 500000.0 \n  – Payment/receipt_status = “Unpaid”\n  – Payment_method = “Account Payable”\n  => This adds 500,000.0.\n Other Purchase rows were paid (using Bank Transfer or Cash) and do not affect the AP balance.\n\n4. Therefore we sum:\n 3,000,000.0 + 500,000.0 = 3,500,000.0\n\nThus, the final “Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable” equals 3500000.00.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"3500000.00\"}\n}",
