                        "content": "We must “extract” the cost of the items that were sold during the period and add these together to arrive at the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). In retail or manufacturing the COGS is calculated by taking (beginning inventory + purchases during the period – ending inventory) but when the information available is a list of transactions including sale entries that already record the cost at which each item was sold (using their “cost_amount” column), a common “shortcut” is to sum the cost amounts on all sale transactions. (In our example both sample and current problems use the sale transactions’ cost field.)\n\nLet’s go through the process step‐by‐step for our data:\n\n1. Look through the table and pick out all rows where the type is “Sale.” (In our transactions these are the rows whose id begins with “Sale”.)\n2. For each such row the “cost_amount” field gives the cost assigned to the item sold. (This represents the cost of the unit times the quantity sold as recorded.) \n3. For our problem these “Sale” rows are:\n\n • Sale20240106004 – cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n • Sale20240108006 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n • Sale20240111008 – cost_amount = 800,000.0  \n • Sale20240114010 – cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n • Sale20240119016 – cost_amount = 1,000,000.0  \n • Sale20240122019 – cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n • Sale20240123021 – cost_amount = 800,000.0  \n • Sale20240124022 – cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n • Sale20240125024 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n • Sale20240126025 – cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n • Sale20240130031 – cost_amount = 1,000,000.0  \n • Sale20240131033 – cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n • Sale20240202035 – cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n • Sale20240204038 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.0\n\n4. Now we add these values together:\n  • Start: 500,000.0  \n  • Plus 1,500,000.0 = 2,000,000.0  \n  • Plus 800,000.0 = 2,800,000.0  \n  • Plus 500,000.0 = 3,300,000.0  \n  • Plus 1,000,000.0 = 4,300,000.0  \n  • Plus 500,000.0 = 4,800,000.0  \n  • Plus 800,000.0 = 5,600,000.0  \n  • Plus 500,000.0 = 6,100,000.0  \n  • Plus 1,500,000.0 = 7,600,000.0  \n  • Plus 500,000.0 = 8,100,000.0  \n  • Plus 1,000,000.0 = 9,100,000.0  \n  • Plus 500,000.0 = 9,600,000.0  \n  • Plus 500,000.0 = 10,100,000.0  \n  • Plus 1,500,000.0 = 11,600,000.0\n\n5. This sum – 11,600,000.0 – is the total cost of the goods that have been “sold” over the period; that is, the cost-of-goods-sold.\n\nThus, the final Cost of Goods Sold line item to be reported in the income statement is 11,600,000.00.\n\nThe answer in the requested JSON output is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"11600000.00\"}\n}",
