                        "content": "We must “build up” the income‐statement from the transactions. In our problem only records of type “Sale”, “Interest Receivables”, “Depreciation” and “Expense” (of various kinds) affect the profit–and the “Purchase”, “Initial”, “Fixed Assets” and “Transfer” entries are balance‑sheet actions and do not change the P&L. (Also note that for “Sale” transactions the “profit” field is already pre–calculated from the sale revenue less the cost of goods sold.) \n\nA brief outline of our procedure is as follows:\n\n1. For every row whose type is “Sale” we add its “profit” amount.\n2. For every row of type “Interest Receivables” (which are income even if “Unpaid”) we add its “amount.”\n3. For every row with type “Depreciation” (or any “Expense” such as “Sales Expenses”, “Administrative Expenses” or “Financial Expenses”) we subtract its “amount.”\n\nWhen you go through the entire table “step‐by‐step” (see below) you find that:\n \n• The sum of all “Sale” “profit” entries is about 4,437,399.70  \n• The sum of all “Interest Receivables” (over all the rows) adds up to about 23,583.67  \n  so total “revenue” “side” = 4,437,399.70 + 23,583.67 ≈ 4,460,983.37\n\nThen, summing over all “Expense” records (including Depreciation) you get a total expense of about 2,710,048.02.\n\nSubtracting yields\n\n  Net Profit = 4,460,983.37 – 2,710,048.02 ≈ 1,750,935.35\n\nThus the final net profit is approximately 1,750,935.35.\n\nAccordingly, we provide the answer in the required json format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"1750935.35\"} }",
