                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” the net profit by treating the income‐side as made up of revenue items (that is, the “profit” from each sale together with any interest income) and subtracting from that the “expense‐side” (all the Expense items as well as “Depreciation”). (Purchases, initial cash/fixed–asset entries, etc. are capital in nature and do not “hit” the income statement.)\n\nIn our sample the following method was used:\n\n1. For each row with type = “Sale” the “profit” field roughly represents the sale’s operating gain (after tax and after having “removed” the cost‐of‐goods sold). In our data the sale rows (by id and date) are (with their “profit” amounts in the last column):\n\n  • Sale20240106004: 248087.14  \n  • Sale20240108006: 646535.22  \n  • Sale20240111008: 351336.63  \n  • Sale20240114010: 193546.26  \n  • Sale20240119016: 348068.18  \n  • Sale20240122019: 194657.72  \n  • Sale20240123021: 276054.24  \n  • Sale20240124022: 177364.56  \n  • Sale20240125024: 710585.18  \n  • Sale20240126025: 161580.66  \n  • Sale20240130031: 492870.60  \n  • Sale20240131033: 217864.25  \n  • Sale20240202035: 160969.70  \n  • Sale20240204038: 609215.99  \n\nAdding these together we get an approximate total sale–profit of about\n\n  4,788,736.33\n\n2. Next, many “Interest Receivables” rows (which have an “amount” in them) add additional operating income. (For instance, while a small number in many problems, if you sum all the Interest rows you get approximately 23,583.67.) So we add that:\n  4,788,736.33 + 23,583.67 ≈ 4,812,320.00\n\n3. On the “expense side” we sum all rows of type “Expense” (including the different administrative, sales, financial‐expense lines) – in our data the sum of all Expense amounts is about:\n  2,596,154.70\n\n4. Also, depreciation is recorded as a separate “Depreciation” row. In our data there are two such entries (one of about 45,745.88 and one of about 60,147.44) whose total is\n  45,745.88 + 60,147.44 = 105,893.32\n\n5. (Other items – such as initial cash/investment entries or purchases – go into the financing or investing sections of the cash flow statement and are not “net‐earned.”)\n\n6. Finally, the “net profit” is computed as the total “income” minus the total “expenses.” In our case\n\n  Income (sale–profit + interest) ≈ 4,812,320.00  \n  Expenses (expenses + depreciation) ≈ 2,596,154.70 + 105,893.32 = 2,702,048.02\n\nSubtracting, we get\n\n  Net Profit ≈ 4,812,320.00 – 2,702,048.02 = 2,110,271.98\n\nThus the final net profit is about 2,110,271.98.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"2110271.98\"}}",
