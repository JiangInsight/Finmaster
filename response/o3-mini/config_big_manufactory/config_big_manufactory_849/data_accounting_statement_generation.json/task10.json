                        "content": "We can work “behind‐the‐scenes” using only the cost figures that change a firm’s “fixed (or non‐current) assets” balance. In our sample the “initial” balance is provided on 2023‑12‑31 as a “Fixed Assets” row of 8,000,000. (All monetary “amount” figures are assumed to be in the same unit.) Then during the period several transactions add new fixed assets (by “Purchase …” or “Fixed Assets Purchase” transactions) while a number of “Sale …” transactions record asset‐disposals (their “cost_amount” is taken to be the book cost being removed) and, finally, “Depreciation” is charged.\n\nA step–by–step outline is given below:\n\n1. The opening “non-current assets” (property, plant, and equipment) are taken from the initial “Fixed Assets” row:\n  Initial value = 8,000,000.00\n\n2. Identify each purchase whose “product” is a heavy equipment/machinery (or represents a “Fixed Assets Purchase”). In our case we add (all numbers in “amount”):\n\n • Purchase20231231001, Heavy Equipment D  1500000.00  \n • FixedAsset20231231001, Heavy Machinery4    886161.25  \n • Purchase20231231002, Heavy Equipment A   500000.00  \n • Purchase20231231003, Heavy Equipment B   1600000.00  \n • Purchase20231231004, Heavy Equipment D   3000000.00  \n • Purchase20231231005, Heavy Equipment C   1000000.00  \n • Purchase20231231006, Heavy Equipment C   2000000.00  \n • Purchase20231231007, Heavy Equipment A   1000000.00  \n • Purchase20231231008, Heavy Equipment B   1600000.00  \n • Purchase20231231009, Heavy Equipment A   1000000.00  \n • Purchase20231231010, Heavy Equipment A   500000.00  \n • Purchase20231231011, Heavy Equipment A   500000.00  \n • Purchase20231231012, Heavy Equipment D   1500000.00  \n • FixedAsset20231231001 (a second one), with asset “Production Line Equipment5”  839853.83  \n • Purchase20231231013, Heavy Equipment A   500000.00  \n • Purchase20231231014, Heavy Equipment C   1000000.00\n\nWhen we add these additions the total is computed as follows:\n  1500000 + 886161.25 = 2386161.25  \n  + 500000   = 2886161.25  \n  + 1600000  = 4486161.25  \n  + 3000000  = 7486161.25  \n  + 1000000  = 8486161.25  \n  + 2000000  = 10486161.25  \n  + 1000000  = 11486161.25  \n  + 1600000  = 13086161.25  \n  + 1000000  = 14086161.25  \n  + 500000   = 14586161.25  \n  + 500000   = 15086161.25  \n  + 1500000  = 16586161.25  \n  + 839853.83 = 17426015.08  \n  + 500000   = 17926015.08  \n  + 1000000  = 18926015.08\n\nThus the “additions” sum to 18,926,015.08. (This is the total value of new asset purchases added over the period.)\n\n3. Next, we subtract those fixed assets that have been sold.\nA number of “Sale …” transactions list a “cost_amount” that shows the original (book) cost of the disposed asset. In our example these sale transactions are (with their “cost_amount” values):\n\n • Sale20240106004, Heavy Equipment A    500000.00  \n • Sale20240108006, Heavy Equipment D    1500000.00  \n • Sale20240111008, Heavy Equipment B    800000.00  \n • Sale20240114010, Heavy Equipment A    500000.00  \n • Sale20240119016, Heavy Equipment C    1000000.00  \n • Sale20240122019, Heavy Equipment A    500000.00  \n • Sale20240123021, Heavy Equipment B    800000.00  \n • Sale20240124022, Heavy Equipment A    500000.00  \n • Sale20240125024, Heavy Equipment D    1500000.00  \n • Sale20240126025, Heavy Equipment A    500000.00  \n • Sale20240130031, Heavy Equipment C    1000000.00  \n • Sale20240131033, Heavy Equipment A    500000.00  \n • Sale20240202035, Heavy Equipment A    500000.00  \n • Sale20240204038, Heavy Equipment D    1500000.00\n\nSumming these 14 disposal items:\n 500000 + 1500000 = 2000000  \n + 800000   = 2800000  \n + 500000   = 3300000  \n + 1000000  = 4300000  \n + 500000   = 4800000  \n + 800000   = 5600000  \n + 500000   = 6100000  \n + 1500000  = 7600000  \n + 500000   = 8100000  \n + 1000000  = 9100000  \n + 500000   = 9600000  \n + 500000   = 10100000  \n + 1500000  = 11600000\n\nSo, the total “disposals” amount to 11,600,000.\n\n4. Finally, the “Depreciation” entries on fixed assets are taken from the period as well. In our sample there are two depreciation transactions:\n • Depreciation20240101001 – 45,745.88  \n • Depreciation20240201002 – 60,147.44  \nTheir sum is 45,745.88 + 60,147.44 = 105,893.32\n\n5. Now we combine the effects:\n (a) The “asset base” before deductions equals the opening balance plus all the additions:\n  8,000,000 + 18,926,015.08 = 26,926,015.08\n\n (b) Then we subtract both the disposed (sold-out) asset cost and the accumulated depreciation:\n  26,926,015.08 – 11,600,000 – 105,893.32 = 15,220,121.76\n\nThus, in our calculated non–current asset “item” on the balance sheet the “initial” fixed asset value was 8,000,000.00 and after recording the asset purchases, asset disposals and depreciation charges the “end‐of–period” value is about 15,220,121.76.\n\nThe final answer is then provided in the requested JSON format as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '15220121.76'}}",
