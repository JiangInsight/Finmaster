                        "content": "We need to “simulate” a cash‐on‐hand calculation from a long list of transactions. In our source data only the “Cash deposit” (and other cash‐related activities) affect the cash on hand. (Note that although the “Bank deposit” or “Fixed Assets” appear on the initial balance sheet, they are not counted as “cash on hand” because only actual cash in hand is counted.) Also, only transactions paid “by Cash” (or “Cash deposit” initially) change the cash balance; many transactions are paid by bank transfer, are recorded as “Unpaid” or are noncash entries (for example, depreciation) and thus are not included. \n\nIn our “Initial” section we have three rows:\n • The first row (“Cash deposit”) shows an amount of 5,000,000.0 – this is the physical cash on hand.\n • The “Bank deposit” and “Fixed Assets” – though recorded – do not add to “cash on hand.”\n\nThen, for every subsequent transaction we “simulate” a cash flow using these rules:\n – Incoming cash: Sale transactions whose “payment method” is Cash \n – Outgoing cash: Expense (Sales, Administrative, Financial) transactions that are “Paid” by Cash plus any purchase that was paid by cash.\n – Transactions with payment method Bank Transfer or “Unpaid” (Accounts Receivable/Payable) as well as depreciation entries are ignored.\n\nI have read through each row and (after a long step‐by‐step review) I have collected a “cash in” total and a “cash out” total. (For clarity we list below our categories and sums.)\n\n• Initial Cash on hand = 5,000,000.00\n\n• Cash Inflows (only the sale transactions paid in cash):\n Sale20240106004: +748,087.14  \n Sale20240108006: +2,146,535.22  \n Sale20240119016: +1,348,068.18  \n Sale20240122019: +694,657.72  \n Sale20240124022: +677,364.56  \n Sale20240125024: +2,210,585.18  \n Sale20240126025: +661,580.66  \n Sale20240130031: +1,492,870.60  \n  Total Inflows ≈ 9,979,749.26\n\n• Cash Outflows (only the “Cash‐paid” expenses and purchases – note that several purchase rows paid by bank transfer or “unpaid” were not included; the detail outflows have been summed over more than 60 cash expense entries) \n Total Outflows ≈ 4,596,154.70\n\nThus, the final cash on hand (the “ending cash”) is computed as follows:\n Final cash = Initial cash + inflows – outflows \n        = 5,000,000.00 + 9,979,749.26 – 4,596,154.70 \n        = 10,383,594.56\n\nThe answer is presented in the desired JSON format.\n\nBelow is our final answer:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"10383594.56\"}}",
