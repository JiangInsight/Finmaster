                        "content": "We need to “build” the expense item by summing – from all rows – the amounts of those transactions that record a cost (not the bank or asset items). In our data the only “expense‐side” transactions are the ones whose type is either an Expense (with a subtype like “Sales Expenses”, “Administrative Expenses”, or “Financial Expenses”) or a Depreciation item. (Lines with “Interest Receivables” – although they show an “amount” – are not “expenses” for the income statement, and items beginning “Purchase”, “Initial”, “FixedAsset”, etc. are treated as asset or inventory transactions.) \n\nBelow you see the list of rows that we include and their “amount” fields:\n\n1.
