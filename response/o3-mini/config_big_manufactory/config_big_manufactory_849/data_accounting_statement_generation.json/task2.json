In our case the only opening‐entry for bank deposits is the “Initial20231231001” row of type “Bank deposit” showing 15,000,000.00. Then, every “outflow” paid by bank transfer (not by “cash” or “account payable”) will reduce that bank deposits account.\n\nLooking over the table, we note the following transactions that use payment_method = “Bank Transfer” (or “Paid” with a bank payment) and so are assumed to withdraw from the Bank deposit:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001 (“Purchase”) – amount = 1,500,000.00  \n2. FixedAsset20231231001 (“Fixed Assets Purchase”) – amount = 886,161.25  \n3. Purchase20231231002 (“Purchase”) – amount = 500,000.00  \n4. Purchase20231231003 (“Purchase”) – amount = 1,600,000.00  \n5. Purchase20231231007 (“Purchase”) – amount = 1,000,000.00  \n6. Purchase20231231008 (“Purchase”) – amount = 1,600,000.00  \n7. Purchase20231231009 (“Purchase”) – amount = 1,000,000.00  \n8. Purchase20231231010 (“Purchase”) – amount = 500,000.00  \n9. Purchase20231231012 (“Purchase”) – amount = 1,500,000.00  \n10. FixedAsset20231231001 (later in the list, another “Fixed Assets Purchase”) – amount = 839,853.83  \n11. Purchase20231231013 (“Purchase”) – amount = 500,000.00  \n12. Purchase20231231014 (“Purchase”) – amount = 1,000,000.00  \n\n(Other purchase entries that are paid by “Cash” or that are recorded as “Account Payable” are assumed not to affect the bank deposits at the time of signing.)\n\nNow let’s sum the bank‐transfer outflows:\n\n• 1,500,000.00  \n+  886,161.25  = 2,386,161.25  \n+  500,000.00  = 2,886,161.25  \n+  1,600,000.00 = 4,486,161.25  \n+  1,000,000.00 = 5,486,161.25  \n+  1,600,000.00 = 7,086,161.25  \n+  1,000,000.00 = 8,086,161.25  \n+  500,000.00  = 8,586,161.25  \n+  1,500,000.00 = 10,086,161.25  \n+  839,853.83  = 10,926,015.08  \n+  500,000.00  = 11,426,015.08  \n+  1,000,000.00 = 12,426,015.08\n\nStarting with the opening balance of 15,000,000.00 the final bank deposit becomes\n\n  15,000,000.00 – 12,426,015.08 = 2,573,984.92\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"15000000.00\",\n    \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"2573984.92\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis is our calculated result step‐by‐step.",
