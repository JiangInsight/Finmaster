                        "content": "We need to “net‐out” every cash impact – that is, add the items that increase cash (the “initial deposits” plus the “cash–received sale amounts”) and subtract every cash–paid outflow (including cash or bank “Paid” purchases, fixed asset purchases paid by bank or cash, and “Expense” items paid in cash). One way to solve the problem is to work “row‐by–row” through the table (or at least to add up the items that affect cash), as explained below.\n\nLet’s summarize the procedure in brief:\n\n1. Start with your initial cash balances. In the problem these come from:  \n  • “Cash deposit” = 5,000,000.0  \n  • “Bank deposit” = 15,000,000.0  \n  So initial cash + bank = 20,000,000.0\n\n2. Next, subtract every “Payment” that uses cash (or bank transfer)––for example, in the “Purchase” rows (if paid “Paid”), the “Fixed Assets Purchase” items that are paid out by bank transfer, and any “Expense” lines which are “Paid” using cash. (Note that non–cash items such as Depreciation or “Interest … Unpaid” do not affect cash.)\n\n3. Then add cash inflows from “Sale” lines when the sale is marked as “Paid” in cash (not those for which the receive method is “Account Receivable”).\n\nGoing “row–by–row” (only listing the key ones) we find (amounts in monetary unit):\n • Outflows (for example):  \n  Purchase20231231001: –1,500,000  \n  FixedAsset20231231001 (“Fixed Assets Purchase”): –886,161.25  \n  Purchase20231231002: –500,000  \n  Expense20240101001 (Sales Expenses): –79,714.42  \n  Expense20240102001 (Financial): –51,825.36  \n  Expense20240102001 (Administrative): –46,725.01  \n  Purchase20231231003: –1,600,000  \n  Expense20240103001: –74,702  \n  Expense20240104001 (Administrative): –78,889.09  \n  Expense20240105001 (Sales): –38,780.99  \n  Expense20240105001 (Administrative): –68,900.09  \n  … (and so on for all rows that “Paid” with Cash or Bank Transfer, including fixed–asset, purchase, expense transactions)\n • Inflows:  \n  Sale20240106004: +748,087.14  \n  Sale20240108006: +2,146,535.22  \n  Sale20240119016: +1,348,068.18  \n  Sale20240122019: +694,657.72  \n  Sale20240124022: +677,364.56  \n  Sale20240125024: +2,210,585.18  \n  Sale20240126025: +661,580.66  \n  Sale20240130031: +1,492,870.60  \n  (All “Sale” rows that are “Paid” in cash add to the inflows; those using “Account Receivable” are not included)\n\nWhen you carefully add all cash–inflows and subtract all cash–outflows the net result comes to\n\n  Ending balance = (20,000,000 + 9,979,749.26) – 18,022,169.78 = 11,957,579.48\n\n(For clarity, one may verify that the sum of all “cash–in” items gives about 9,979,749.26, and the sum of every “cash–out” item totals about 18,022,169.78; then the net cash available is 29,979,749.26 – 18,022,169.78.)\n\nThus, the final ending cash and cash equivalents balance (including cash and bank deposits) is 11,957,579.48.\n\nWe now present the answer as required.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"11957579.48\"}}\n```",
