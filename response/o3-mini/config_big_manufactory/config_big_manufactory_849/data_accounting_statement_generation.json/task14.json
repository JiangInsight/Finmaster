                        "content": "We must first decide which kinds of transactions represent “current liabilities.” In our books the “Purchase” transactions normally are recorded as either paid or “Unpaid.” Only a purchase that has not been paid yet creates an accounts‐payable liability (a current liability). (Other items such as “Initial” deposits and “Fixed Assets” add to the asset side while “Expense” items that are paid are already settled; and “Interest Receivables” are assets.) \n\nStep 1. Look at the opening (initial) transactions. In our file there are three “Initial20231231001” transactions (cash deposit, bank deposit, fixed assets). None of them create a liability. (They set up asset side items.) Therefore the “initial” value of current liabilities is 0.00.\n\nStep 2. Next we scan all “Purchase” transactions to see which remain unpaid. In the new problem set there are many purchase transactions. Reviewing the list:\n\n• The purchase with id “Purchase20231231001” is paid.\n• “Purchase20231231002” is paid.\n• “Purchase20231231003” is paid.\n• “Purchase20231231004” has amount = 3000000.0 and its payment/receipt_status is “Unpaid” (with payment_method “Account Payable”). This creates a current liability.\n• “Purchase20231231005” is paid.\n• “Purchase20231231006” is paid.\n• “Purchase20231231007” is paid.\n• “Purchase20231231008” is paid.\n• “Purchase20231231009” is paid.\n• “Purchase20231231010” is paid.\n• “Purchase20231231011” has amount = 500000.0 and is marked “Unpaid” (with payment_method “Account Payable”).\n• “Purchase20231231012”, “Purchase20231231013” and “Purchase20231231014” are paid.\n\nThus the only two purchase lines that contribute to an outstanding accounts‐payable (current liability) are “Purchase20231231004” and “Purchase20231231011.”\n\nStep 3. Calculate the outstanding liability amount:\n  3000000.0 + 500000.0 = 3500000.0\n\nStep 4. Reporting our result “initial” (before any operations) is 0.00 and the “end” value (the liability balance after processing all transactions) is 3500000.00.\n\nThus, our answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"3500000.00\"\n  }\n}",
