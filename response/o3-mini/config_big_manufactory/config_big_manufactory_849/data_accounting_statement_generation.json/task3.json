                        "content": "We must “build” an inventory account for the period from December 31 – February 01 by looking at the transactions that add items to inventory (the “Purchase” lines for items that we eventually sell) minus the cost of the items sold (the “Sale” lines’ COGS values, here given as “cost_amount”). (Any “Initial” transactions related to cash, bank, fixed assets, etc. are not “inventory‐items” so the beginning inventory is zero.) \n\nStep 1. Identify purchases (ignoring FixedAsset–type or “Initial” rows). In our new problem the “Purchase” rows are the following (all dated 2023‑12‑31):\n\n• Purchase20231231001: amount = 1,500,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231002: amount = 500,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231003: amount = 1,600,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231004: amount = 3,000,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231005: amount = 1,000,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231006: amount = 2,000,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231007: amount = 1,000,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231008: amount = 1,600,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231009: amount = 1,000,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231010: amount = 500,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231011: amount = 500,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231012: amount = 1,500,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231013: amount = 500,000.0  \n• Purchase20231231014: amount = 1,000,000.0\n\nSumming these amounts gives:\n\n  1,500,000 + 500,000 = 2,000,000  \n  2,000,000 + 1,600,000 = 3,600,000  \n  3,600,000 + 3,000,000 = 6,600,000  \n  6,600,000 + 1,000,000 = 7,600,000  \n  7,600,000 + 2,000,000 = 9,600,000  \n  9,600,000 + 1,000,000 = 10,600,000  \n  10,600,000 + 1,600,000 = 12,200,000  \n  12,200,000 + 1,000,000 = 13,200,000  \n  13,200,000 + 500,000 = 13,700,000  \n  13,700,000 + 500,000 = 14,200,000  \n  14,200,000 + 1,500,000 = 15,700,000  \n  15,700,000 + 500,000 = 16,200,000  \n  16,200,000 + 1,000,000 = 17,200,000\n\nThus the total cost of all purchased inventory is 17,200,000.\n\nStep 2. Identify the “Sale” transactions that remove inventory from the warehouse – that is, those sales in which the product is one of our heavy equipment and the “cost_amount” field shows the cost allocated to that sale. In our problem the Sale rows (with their cost amounts) are:\n\n1. Sale20240106004: cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n2. Sale20240108006: cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n3. Sale20240111008: cost_amount = 800,000.0  \n4. Sale20240114010: cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n5. Sale20240119016: cost_amount = 1,000,000.0  \n6. Sale20240122019: cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n7. Sale20240123021: cost_amount = 800,000.0  \n8. Sale20240124022: cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n9. Sale20240125024: cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n10. Sale20240126025: cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n11. Sale20240130031: cost_amount = 1,000,000.0  \n12. Sale20240131033: cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n13. Sale20240202035: cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n14. Sale20240204038: cost_amount = 1,500,000.0\n\nNow, add these amounts:\n\n• 500,000.0 + 1,500,000.0 = 2,000,000.0  \n• 2,000,000.0 + 800,000.0 = 2,800,000.0  \n• 2,800,000.0 + 500,000.0 = 3,300,000.0  \n• 3,300,000.0 + 1,000,000.0 = 4,300,000.0  \n• 4,300,000.0 + 500,000.0 = 4,800,000.0  \n• 4,800,000.0 + 800,000.0 = 5,600,000.0  \n• 5,600,000.0 + 500,000.0 = 6,100,000.0  \n• 6,100,000.0 + 1,500,000.0 = 7,600,000.0  \n• 7,600,000.0 + 500,000.0 = 8,100,000.0  \n• 8,100,000.0 + 1,000,000.0 = 9,100,000.0  \n• 9,100,000.0 + 500,000.0 = 9,600,000.0  \n• 9,600,000.0 + 500,000.0 = 10,100,000.0  \n• 10,100,000.0 + 1,500,000.0 = 11,600,000.0\n\nThus the total cost of goods sold (COGS) is 11,600,000.\n\nStep 3. Compute the ending inventory value:\n  Ending inventory = (Total purchases) – (COGS)  \n    = 17,200,000 – 11,600,000  \n    = 5,600,000\n\nStep 4. The initial inventory balance for this reporting period, based on the “Initial” rows, does not include any inventory items (only cash, bank and fixed assets appear) so we take it as 0.00.\n\nThus the final answer is:\n\nInitial Inventory Value: 0.00  \nEnding Inventory Value: 5600000.00\n\nWe now present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\nFinal answer:\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Inventory End Value\": \"5600000.00\"}}",
