Let’s walk through the process step by step.\n\nStep 1. From the given transactions list, we go row by row and select only those rows whose “type” column is “Expense” and that have the specific category of “Financial Expenses.”\n\nLooking through the provided transactions the following rows qualify (showing the id, type and the “amount” field):\n\n• Row with id Expense20240102001 – type “Financial Expenses” – amount = 51825.36  \n• Row with id Expense20240108001 – type “Financial Expenses” – amount = 52268.2  \n• Row with id Expense20240111001 – type “Financial Expenses” – amount = 57634.9  \n• Row with id Expense20240112001 – type “Financial Expenses” – amount = 20862.57  \n• Row with id Expense20240117001 – type “Financial Expenses” – amount = 69211.25  \n• Row with id Expense20240120001 – type “Financial Expenses” – amount = 87474.45  \n• Row with id Expense20240123001 – type “Financial Expenses” – amount = 14855.75  \n• Row with id Expense20240127001 – second “Financial Expenses” row – amount = 74109.93  \n• Row with id Expense20240201001 – the row with “Financial Expenses” (note that another Expense20240201001 row is Administrative Expenses, so ignore it) – amount = 12261.8  \n• Row with id Expense20240204001 – type “Financial Expenses” – amount = 83123.11\n\nStep 2. Sum these amounts.\n\nLet’s add them step by step:\n\n1. 51825.36 + 52268.2 = 104093.56  \n2. 104093.56 + 57634.9 = 161728.46  \n3. 161728.46 + 20862.57 = 182591.03  \n4. 182591.03 + 69211.25 = 251802.28  \n5. 251802.28 + 87474.45 = 339276.73  \n6. 339276.73 + 14855.75 = 354132.48  \n7. 354132.48 + 74109.93 = 428242.41  \n8. 428242.41 + 12261.8 = 440504.21  \n9. 440504.21 + 83123.11 = 523627.32  \n\nStep 3. The final sum for “Financial Expenses” is 523627.32.\n\nThus, the answer formatted in JSON is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Financial Expenses\": \"523627.32\"}\n}",
