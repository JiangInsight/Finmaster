                        "content": "We can think of the “owners’ equity” in two parts. One part is the “initial‐capital” established by the initial funding – for example “Initial20231231001” records that posted amount for “Cash deposit”, “Bank deposit” and “Fixed Assets.” The other major change occurs as the business “runs” – its operating results (its “net profit” or “loss”) move equity up or down.\n\nIn our “problem to solve” the first three rows give the initial injections:\n\n• Cash deposit – 5,000,000.00  \n• Bank deposit – 15,000,000.00  \n• Fixed Assets – 8,000,000.00  \n\nThat sums to an initial owners’ equity of\n\n  5,000,000.00 + 15,000,000.00 + 8,000,000.00 = 28,000,000.00\n\nThen, the business “operates” through many transactions. In our data “Sale” rows already include a “profit” amount (the excess of the after–tax sale proceeds over the cost of sale) and there are also “Interest Receivables” transactions that add minor positive income. (Other transactions such as “Purchases” or “Fixed Assets Purchase” are conversion of one asset into another and so do not by themselves affect net profit.) Also, many “Expense”–type transactions (for Sales, Administrative, Financial, and also “Depreciation” for long–lived assets) are recorded.\n\nOne acceptable approach is to “sum up” the operating profit that actually “flows into” owners’ equity – i.e. add together the “profit” from every Sale transaction and add in the “Interest Receivables” (which are income) then subtract the “operating expense” side (the purchases of goods, administrative/financial/sales expenses and depreciation have already been “netted out” to produce the sale profit values). In our records the “Sale” rows explicitly include a “profit” (for example, one Sale row gives profit = 248087.14, another 646535.22, etc.). When we add up the 14 “Sale” records that provided a profit – plus add in the sums from the “Interest Receivables” rows – one obtains approximately\n\n  Total Sale–profit ≈ 4,788,736.34  \n  Total Interest income ≈      23,583.67  \n  ------------------------------------------------–  \n  Total positive operating effect ≈ 4,812,320.01\n\nNow, we must “offset” those operating results against the various expenses (of which we have many “Expense…” and “Depreciation…” transactions). When all the “Expense” transactions are summed (including Sales, Administrative, Financial expenses) the total comes out to be roughly\n\n  Total expenses ≈ 2,702,048.02\n\nThus, the “net profit” (income minus expense) is about\n\n  Net profit ≈ 4,812,320.01 – 2,702,048.02 ≈ 2,110,272.00\n\nFinally, the end–of–period owners’ equity is simply\n\n  Initial owners’ equity + net profit  \n     = 28,000,000.00 + 2,110,272.00  \n     ≈ 30,110,272.00\n\nSo the answers are:\n\n• Total Owners Equity Initial Value: 28,000,000.00  \n• Total Owners Equity End Value: 30,110,272.00\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\",\n    \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"30110272.00\"\n  }\n} \n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nNote: In practice one would decide exactly which transactions are “profit‐items” (such as using the profits explicitly given on sale rows plus interest income) and only these (rather than the “gross” sale amounts) affect the net income. Here the provided “profit” fields on sale rows (plus interest income) minus the detailed “Expense” totals lead to the above net profit which then adds to the initial 28 million.",
