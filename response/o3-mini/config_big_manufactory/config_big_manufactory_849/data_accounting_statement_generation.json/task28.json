                        "content": "We must sum up all the “Sales Expenses” amounts recorded in the transactions. One way to do this is to “filter” the table for those rows whose type equals “Sales Expenses” and then add up their amount values. (Note that “Sales Expenses” is sometimes also called “Selling Expenses” on the income statement.)\n\nBelow is one way to “walk‐through” the process:\n\n1. From the data we identify the rows where the type is “Sales Expenses” (we ignore Administrative, Financial, Depreciation, etc.) In our table the following rows (with the “amount” values) are “Sales Expenses”:\n  • Expense20240101001 – 79,714.42  \n  • Expense20240103001 – 74,702.00  \n  • Expense20240105001 – 38,780.99  \n  • Expense20240106001 – 87,591.46  \n  • Expense20240109001 – 93,194.55  \n  • Expense20240113001 (Sales Expenses part) – 20,833.95  \n  • Expense20240115001 (Sales Expenses) – 70,515.58  \n  • Expense20240116001 (first Sales Expenses row) – 73,168.68  \n  • Expense20240116001 (second Sales Expenses row) – 96,515.15  \n  • Expense20240117001 (Sales Expenses part) – 53,607.84  \n  • Expense20240118001 – 14,562.34  \n  • Expense20240119001 – 86,673.60  \n  • Expense20240121001 – 83,217.37  \n  • Expense20240122001 – 28,972.80  \n  • Expense20240124001 (Sales Expenses) – 39,148.75  \n  • Expense20240126001 (first Sales Expenses) – 60,508.87  \n  • Expense20240126001 (second Sales Expenses) – 33,905.06  \n  • Expense20240128001 (first Sales Expenses) – 42,910.54  \n  • Expense20240128001 (second Sales Expenses) – 49,551.38  \n  • Expense20240129001 – 63,370.00  \n  • Expense20240130001 – 45,613.09  \n  • Expense20240131001 – 42,688.86  \n  • Expense20240202001 – 31,799.89  \n  • Expense20240203001 – 22,552.80\n\n2. Now add these numbers step‐by‐step:\n  79,714.42  \n+ 74,702.00 = 154,416.42  \n+ 38,780.99 = 193,197.41  \n+ 87,591.46 = 280,788.87  \n+ 93,194.55 = 373,983.42  \n+ 20,833.95 = 394,817.37  \n+ 70,515.58 = 465,332.95  \n+ 73,168.68 = 538,501.63  \n+ 96,515.15 = 635,016.78  \n+ 53,607.84 = 688,624.62  \n+ 14,562.34 = 703,186.96  \n+ 86,673.60 = 789,860.56  \n+ 83,217.37 = 873,077.93  \n+ 28,972.80 = 902,050.73  \n+ 39,148.75 = 941,199.48  \n+ 60,508.87 = 1,001,708.35  \n+ 33,905.06 = 1,035,613.41  \n+ 42,910.54 = 1,078,523.95  \n+ 49,551.38 = 1,128,075.33  \n+ 63,370.00 = 1,191,445.33  \n+ 45,613.09 = 1,237,058.42  \n+ 42,688.86 = 1,279,747.28  \n+ 31,799.89 = 1,311,547.17  \n+ 22,552.80 = 1,334,099.97\n\n3. The final summed amount is approximately 1,334,099.97.\n\nThus, the final “Selling Expenses” (as reported on the income statement) amount is about 1,334,099.97.\n\nWe now present our answer in the required json format.\n\nFinal answer:\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Selling Expenses\": \"1334099.97\"\n  }\n}",
