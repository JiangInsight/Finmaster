                        "content": "We must “build up” the receivables balance by adding in – throughout the reporting period – every transaction that creates a receivable. (Since no “opening‐balance” transaction created an AR item the “initial” AR is zero.) In our example the only transactions that “build up” AR are those created on a sale when the customer did not pay immediately (that is, a Sale with a “receive_method” of Account Receviable) plus any “Interest Receivables” whose payment status is “Unpaid”. (Other transactions – such as cash deposits, bank deposits, purchases, expenses, depreciation, etc. – do not affect the AR balance.)\n\nBelow is one way to break the calculation down:\n\n1. (Initial value) No “Beginning‐of‐period AR” transaction is recorded so we set \n  Accounts Receivable Initial Value = 0.00\n\n2. Next we “add in” every AR‐creating transaction. For example, reading the table we note that (with approximate amounts as given by the “amount” field):\n\n  • Several “Interest Receivables” appear. For instance, one interest receivable of 1201.50, another of 1078.13, then many repeated “Interest receviable” entries of values such as 935.73; 846.73; 704.33; 615.33; 570.83; 437.33; and 229.08. (These come from rows with id’s “Interest20240101001”, “Interest20240102002”, “Interest20240103003”, “Interest20240104004”, “Interest20240105005”, etc.) \n  • In addition, there are six “Sale” transactions (for example, see the rows with id “Sale20240111008”, “Sale20240114010”, “Sale20240123021”, “Sale20240131033”, etc.) that have “receive_method” noted as Account Receviable and (because their payment/receipt status is “Unpaid”) create a receivable. Their amounts are approximately:\n    1151336.63  \n    693546.26  \n    1076054.24  \n    717864.25  \n    660969.70  \n    2109215.99\n\nIf you add up these six “sale” receivables you get roughly 6,408,987.07. Then, if you add in all of the “Interest Receivable” entries (which, when added together, total roughly 23,583.66), the overall “AR‐credit” total over the reporting period comes to about\n\n  6,408,987.07 + 23,583.66 = 6,432,570.73\n\n3. (Final value) Because no AR have been “written off” or “collected” (that is, no payment against pre‐existing receivables exists), the final AR is simply the sum of all transactions that created AR. In our case this final value is therefore about 6,432,570.73.\n\nThus we report our answer as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"6432570.73\"} }\n```\n\nNote: In practice each “Interest Receivable” amount is carried with full (and possibly many‐decimal) precision; here the numbers have been rounded only at the end to two decimals.",
