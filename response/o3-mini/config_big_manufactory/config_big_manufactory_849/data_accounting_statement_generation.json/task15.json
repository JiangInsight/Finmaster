                        "content": "We need to “build‐up” the liability balance by “looking” at the transactions that create outstanding liabilities. In our data the only transactions that record a purchase with a status of “Unpaid” (and/or a payment method of “Account Payable”) are the ones that increase our liabilities. (Initial transactions for cash, bank and fixed assets are all on the asset side and do not affect liabilities.)\n\nLet’s check the purchase rows:\n\n• The 4th transaction (Purchase20231231001) is a purchase of 1,500,000.0 but its status is “Paid” so it does not generate an outstanding liability.\n• The 9th, 13th, 23rd, 26th, 33rd, 44th, 51st, 80th, etc. purchases are all “Paid.”\n• Then we come to the row with id Purchase20231231004 – this row is of type “Purchase” for 3,000,000.0 with status “Unpaid” (and the payment method is “Account Payable”). That means we owe 3,000,000.0.\n• Later, the row with id Purchase20231231011 (note the “Unpaid” status with payment_method “Account Payable”) has an amount of 500,000.0.\n\nNone of the other transactions (even if they are “Interest Receivables” with an “Unpaid” status) count toward liabilities because interest receivables represent amounts to be collected (that is, they are assets).\n\nSince there were no liability entries in the “Initial” opening (the three “Initial…” rows are simply asset seeds), the initial liabilities balance is 0.00.\n\nThen, the “end” liability amount (based on the outstanding purchase amounts) is simply the sum from our two unpaid purchase transactions:\n\n  3,000,000.0 + 500,000.0 = 3,500,000.0\n\nThus in our answer we provide two numbers (formatted with two decimals):\n\nTotal Liabilities Initial Value = 0.00  \nTotal Liabilities End Value = 3500000.00\n\nSo our final output in the requested json format is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"3500000.00\"}}",
