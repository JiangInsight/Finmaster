In our case the “inventorized” items are those bought in the Purchase entries (with product IDs P001–P004) and then later sold in the Sale entries.\n\nStep 1. – Sum up purchases by product\n\n• P001 (Heavy Equipment A):\n – From Purchase20231231002: 1 unit at 500,000  \n – From Purchase20231231007: 2 units at 500,000 each → 1,000,000  \n – From Purchase20231231009: 2 units at 500,000 each → 1,000,000  \n – From Purchase20231231010: 1 unit at 500,000  \n – From Purchase20231231011: 1 unit at 500,000  \n – From Purchase20231231013: 1 unit at 500,000  \n  Total purchased: 1+2+2+1+1+1 = 8 units  \n  Total cost = 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 = 4,000,000\n\n• P002 (Heavy Equipment B):\n – From Purchase20231231003: 2 units at 800,000 each → 1,600,000  \n – From Purchase20231231008: 2 units at 800,000 each → 1,600,000  \n  Total purchased: 2+2 = 4 units  \n  Total cost = 1,600,000 + 1,600,000 = 3,200,000\n\n• P003 (Heavy Equipment C):\n – From Purchase20231231005: 1 unit at 1,000,000  \n – From Purchase20231231006: 2 units at 1,000,000 each → 2,000,000  \n – From Purchase20231231014: 1 unit at 1,000,000  \n  Total purchased: 1+2+1 = 4 units  \n  Total cost = 1,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 4,000,000\n\n• P004 (Heavy Equipment D):\n – From Purchase20231231001: 1 unit at 1,500,000  \n – From Purchase20231231004: 2 units at 1,500,000 each → 3,000,000  \n – From Purchase20231231012: 1 unit at 1,500,000  \n  Total purchased: 1+2+1 = 4 units  \n  Total cost = 1,500,000 + 3,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 6,000,000\n\nStep 2. – Sum up sales (using the “cost_amount” given in each sale row to represent the cost removed from inventory)\n\nLooking at the sale transactions that mention our products we obtain:\n\n• P001:\n – Sale20240106004: sold 1 unit – cost 500,000  \n – Sale20240114010: sold 1 unit – cost 500,000  \n – Sale20240122019: sold 1 unit – cost 500,000  \n – Sale20240124022: sold 1 unit – cost 500,000  \n – Sale20240126025: sold 1 unit – cost 500,000  \n – Sale20240131033: sold 1 unit – cost 500,000  \n – Sale20240202035: sold 1 unit – cost 500,000  \n  Total sold: 7 units  \n  Total cost = 7 × 500,000 = 3,500,000\n\n• P002:\n – Sale20240111008: sold 1 unit – cost 800,000  \n – Sale20240123021: sold 1 unit – cost 800,000  \n  Total sold: 2 units  \n  Total cost = 2 × 800,000 = 1,600,000\n\n• P003:\n – Sale20240119016: sold 1 unit – cost 1,000,000  \n – Sale20240130031: sold 1 unit – cost 1,000,000  \n  Total sold: 2 units  \n  Total cost = 2,000,000\n\n• P004:\n – Sale20240108006: sold 1 unit – cost 1,500,000  \n – Sale20240125024: sold 1 unit – cost 1,500,000  \n – Sale20240204038: sold 1 unit – cost 1,500,000  \n  Total sold: 3 units  \n  Total cost = 3 × 1,500,000 = 4,500,000\n\nStep 3. – Calculate ending inventory\n\nFor each product the ending inventory is the purchased cost minus the sold cost:\n\n• P001: Ending cost = 4,000,000 – 3,500,000 = 500,000  \n• P002: Ending cost = 3,200,000 – 1,600,000 = 1,600,000  \n• P003: Ending cost = 4,000,000 – 2,000,000 = 2,000,000  \n• P004: Ending cost = 6,000,000 – 4,500,000 = 1,500,000  \n\nTotal ending inventory = 500,000 + 1,600,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 5,600,000\n\nStep 4. – Determine the change in inventory\n\nIf there is no opening balance (other than what was purchased during the period) then the ending inventory of 5,600,000 represents an increase in inventory over the period. In the cash flow statement an increase in inventory is shown as a use of cash (a “decrease” in cash flow).\n\nThus the “(Increase) Decrease in Inventory” line item is –5,600,000.00\n\nPresenting the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-5600000.00\"\n  }\n}",
