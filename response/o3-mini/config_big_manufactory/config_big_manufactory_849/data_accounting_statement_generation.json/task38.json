                        "content": "We must “build” the AR balance from only those transactions that change a company’s receivables. In our records only sales made on credit (i.e. with the “receive_method” equal to “Account Receviable”) affect AR. (Any cash‐sales immediately bring cash in and do not add to AR.) Also, note that any credit sale that is “Unpaid” creates an AR item—in the cash flow statement an increase in AR is “a use of cash” (and so is shown with a negative sign).\n\nLet’s scan the “Sale” entries in our data and check – using the defined column order, the 18th column (“receive_method”) indicates how the sale was received. In the following rows the “receive_method” is “Account Receviable” so they “add” to AR:\n\n1. Row with id Sale20240111008  \n  • amount = 1,151,336.63 (but the key value is the “after_tax_amount” = 1,093,769.80)  \n    → AR increase: 1,093,769.80\n\n2. Row with id Sale20240114010  \n  • “after_tax_amount” = 658,868.95  \n    → AR increase: 658,868.95\n\n3. Row with id Sale20240123021  \n  • “after_tax_amount” = 1,022,251.53  \n    → AR increase: 1,022,251.53\n\n4. Row with id Sale20240131033  \n  • “after_tax_amount” = 681,971.04  \n    → AR increase: 681,971.04\n\n5. Row with id Sale20240202035  \n  • “after_tax_amount” = 627,921.21  \n    → AR increase: 627,921.21\n\n6. Row with id Sale20240204038  \n  • “after_tax_amount” = 2,003,755.19  \n    → AR increase: 2,003,755.19\n\n(Other sales are received in cash and so are not “credited” to AR.)\n\nNow we add these amounts to compute the ending AR balance (assuming that prior to these transactions the AR balance was zero):\n\n Total AR = 1,093,769.80  \n     + 658,868.95 = 1,752,638.75  \n     + 1,022,251.53 = 2,774,890.28  \n     + 681,971.04  = 3,456,861.32  \n     + 627,921.21  = 4,084,782.53  \n     + 2,003,755.19 = 6,088,537.72\n\nSince an increase in AR is reported as a “use” of cash in the operating section, we show it with a minus sign. (No offsetting collections on receivables appear in these data, so the net change from the beginning balance of zero is an increase of 6,088,537.72.)\n\nThus, the final cash flow statement item that relates to changes in receivables is:\n\n{\n  \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-6088537.72\"\n}\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format. \n\n--------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-6088537.72\"} }\n```",
