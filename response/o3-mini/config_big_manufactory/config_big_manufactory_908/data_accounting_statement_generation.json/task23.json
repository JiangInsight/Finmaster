In our transactions the sales records (the rows with type “Sale”) include a field called “cost_amount” that tells us the cost at which that product was taken out of inventory (or “cost of goods sold” for that sale).\n\nStep‐by‐step, we extract the sales transactions and add up their cost_amount values:\n\n1. Sale20240103002 for Heavy Equipment C has cost_amount = 1,000,000.00  \n2. Sale20240115014 for Heavy Equipment A has cost_amount = 500,000.00  \n3.

Sale20240202036 for Heavy Equipment D has cost_amount = 1,500,000.00  \n12. Sale20240204039 for Heavy Equipment D has cost_amount = 1,500,000.00  \n13. Sale20240205041 for Heavy Equipment C has cost_amount = 1,000,000.00  \n\nNow add these numbers:  \n1,000,000 + 500,000 = 1,500,000  \n1,500,000 + 500,000 = 2,000,000  \n2,000,000 + 800,000 = 2,800,000  \n2,800,000 + 800,000 = 3,600,000  \n3,600,000 + 800,000 = 4,400,000  \n4,400,000 + 500,000 = 4,900,000  \n4,900,000 + 1,000,000 = 5,900,000  \n5,900,000 + 500,000 = 6,400,000  \n6,400,000 + 1,000,000 = 7,400,000  \n7,400,000 + 1,500,000 = 8,900,000  \n8,900,000 + 1,500,000 = 10,400,000  \n10,400,000 + 1,000,000 = 11,400,000\n\nThus, the overall cost of goods sold is 11,400,000.00.\n\nWe now output the answer in the required JSON format.\n\nFinal answer in JSON:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"11400000.00\"}\n}",
