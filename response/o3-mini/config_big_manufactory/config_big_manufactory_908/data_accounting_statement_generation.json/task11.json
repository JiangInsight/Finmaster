                        "content": "We can “build‐up” the final balance conceptually by “starting” with the beginning (or “initial”) asset accounts and then “adding” those asset changes (and “subtracting” those items that lower an asset’s value) that are not “just shifting money around” (for example, between cash and bank, or when a paid purchase simply converts one asset into another).\n\nIn our “problem” the three initial entries tell us that at December 31 the company held\n • Cash deposit = 5,000,000.00 \n • Bank deposit = 15,000,000.00 \n • Fixed Assets = 8,000,000.00 \nso that the initial total‐assets sum is\n\n  5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 28,000,000.00\n\nThen – roughly – the “non‐conversion” transactions (that is, those that add a “new” asset such as an “unpaid” purchase or a new fixed‐asset recorded by a “Fixed Assets Purchase” entry, plus “interest receivables” that have not yet been paid, and any “profit from sales” that is “earned” for the business) will boost the asset “pool.” In contrast, items such as expenses (cash paid out) and depreciation (which lowers the book value of fixed assets) reduce the overall asset total.\n\nA fairly standard (though simplified) “build–up” for the ending assets is as follows:\n\n1. Add to the initial total all “new” asset recognitions that are not simply cash–for–cash conversions. In our case these include:\n • Two “unpaid” purchase entries (one for Heavy Equipment C and one for Heavy Equipment A) that add a total of 1,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 = 2,000,000.00.\n • The two “Fixed Assets Purchase” entries (which record “new” fixed assets purchased by other means) whose amounts add to 1,219,968.64 + 1,509,063.62 = 2,729,032.26.\n • “Interest Receivables” recorded over the period (all the “Interest” transactions that are marked “Unpaid”) which add about 13,239.11.\n • And finally the “profit” reported on the “Sale” lines (which—after the cancellation of cost versus sales revenue—adds net to the asset total) which in our data add to roughly 5,368,356.89.\n\n2. From that subtotal we subtract those events that lower asset values:\n • The “Depreciation” entries (which lower the book–value of fixed assets) come in at 45,747.00 plus 74,884.67 = 120,631.67.\n • And the “Expense” entries (which are out–flows of cash or other asset reductions) sum up to roughly 2,972,326.00.\n\nThus the net “adjustment” beyond the starting value is estimated as\n\n  2,000,000.00 + 2,729,032.26 + 13,239.11 + 5,368,356.89 \n        = 10,110,628.26 \n  minus (120,631.67 + 2,972,326.00) ≈ 10,110,628.26 – 3,092,957.67 \n        ≈ 7,017,670.59\n\nFinally, adding this net “adjustment” to the beginning total gives\n\n  28,000,000.00 + 7,017,670.59 = 35,017,670.59\n\n(Notice that many transactions – for example those that simply move money between bank and cash – drop out of the net change calculation; only transactions that either create new asset balances or “use up” an asset are counted.)\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nTotal Assets Initial Value = 28,000,000.00 \nTotal Assets End Value ≈ 35,017,670.59\n\nWe now present the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Assets Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\", \"Total Assets End Value\": \"35017670.59\"}}\n```",
