In our trial data the “initial” transactions (those with id starting with Initial…) show only “asset” balances (cash, bank and fixed assets) and no borrowed funds or “payable‐type” items. (Sometimes, a beginning “balance‐sheet” might include old liabilities but here no such entries exist.) \n\nThen, among our subsequent transactions only some “Purchase” entries are “Unpaid” and have a payment method of “Account Payable.” In our data there are two such “Purchase” transactions:\n • One with id Purchase20231231007 has an amount of 1000000.0 and is marked “Unpaid” (with payment_method “Account Payable”).\n • One with id Purchase20231231013 again is “Unpaid” for the amount of 1000000.0.\n \nAll other transactions are either “Paid” (or are expense or sale entries) or involve “Interest Receivables” (which are amounts expected to be received – assets). \n\nThus, no beginning liability entries are recorded so the “Total Liabilities Initial Value” is 0.00. The ending liabilities come from the sum of the two outstanding purchases (which have not been paid), namely:\n\n 1000000.0 + 1000000.0 = 2000000.00\n\nSo we conclude the final liabilities total is 2000000.00.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required json format.\n\n================================\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"2000000.00\"}}",
