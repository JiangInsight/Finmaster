                        "content": "We can “derive” an income‐statement “cost” by adding up the cost components that were allocated to each sale transaction. In our setup the sale rows include a field labeled “cost_amount.” (In a full real‐world income statement, COGS is computed from things like beginning inventory + purchases – ending inventory, but here the books have already “posted” a cost figure for each sale.) \n\nLooking at each transaction of type “Sale” in the problem, we note the following cost amounts for each sale (the numbers appear in the “cost_amount” column):\n\n • Sale20240103002: 1,000,000.00  \n • Sale20240108007: 1,000,000.00  \n • Sale20240109009: 1,000,000.00  \n • Sale20240115014: 500,000.00  \n • Sale20240116016: 500,000.00  \n • Sale20240117018: 800,000.00  \n • Sale20240118019: 800,000.00  \n • Sale20240119021: 800,000.00  \n • Sale20240120023: 500,000.00  \n • Sale20240122024: 1,000,000.00  \n • Sale20240123026: 500,000.00  \n • Sale20240130032: 1,000,000.00  \n • Sale20240202036: 1,500,000.00  \n • Sale20240204039: 1,500,000.00  \n • Sale20240205041: 1,000,000.00  \n\nNow, we add these up step by step:\n\n 1,000,000.00 (first sale)  \n+ 1,000,000.00 = 2,000,000.00  \n+ 1,000,000.00 = 3,000,000.00  \n+ 500,000.00 = 3,500,000.00  \n+ 500,000.00 = 4,000,000.00  \n+ 800,000.00 = 4,800,000.00  \n+ 800,000.00 = 5,600,000.00  \n+ 800,000.00 = 6,400,000.00  \n+ 500,000.00 = 6,900,000.00  \n+1,000,000.00 = 7,900,000.00  \n+ 500,000.00 = 8,400,000.00  \n+1,000,000.00 = 9,400,000.00  \n+1,500,000.00 = 10,900,000.00  \n+1,500,000.00 = 12,400,000.00  \n+1,000,000.00 = 13,400,000.00  \n\nThus, the summed cost amount for all sale transactions is 13,400,000.00.\n\nThis “Total Cost” would be the cost item on the income statement (that is, the cost of goods sold based on these recorded sale cost_amount figures).\n\nThe final answer is then:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Cost\": \"13400000.00\"\n  }\n}",
