                        "content": "We have a long list of transactions. In this example the “Initial” transactions are the starting values that the balance‐sheet “Owners Equity and Liabilities” item is built on. In the sample problem the three “Initial” rows had total 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 28,000,000. (Note that although these are “assets” items, in our system the owners’ equity for a start‐up is simply the “capital” contributed at the beginning.) \n\nThen at closing the balance‐sheet “Liabilities and Owners Equity” is increased by the cumulative “profit” generated by selling goods – that is, the net income that is transferred into retained earnings. (Other transactions, such as purchases or expense entries, affect the income statement so that the “profit” figure computed on each sale (after cost, tax etc.) already is the “net income” component.) \n\nFor our data the only rows that include a “profit” value are the sales entries. Their “profit” fields are as follows:\n\n1. Sale20240103002:    302111.59  \n2. Sale20240108007:    460946.33  \n3. Sale20240109009:    489365.79  \n4. Sale20240115014:    174738.01  \n5.

Sale20240122024:   499323.77  \n11. Sale20240123026:   210732.40  \n12. Sale20240130032:   384532.44  \n13. Sale20240202036:   563873.27  \n14. Sale20240204039:   502579.13  \n15. Sale20240205041:   428329.11  \n\nAdding these we get:\n\n 302111.59  \n+ 460946.33 = 763057.92  \n+ 489365.79 = 1,252,423.71  \n+ 174738.01 = 1,427,161.72  \n+ 151423.21 = 1,578,584.93  \n+ 324652.91 = 1,903,237.84  \n+ 366055.78 = 2,269,293.62  \n+ 350635.95 = 2,619,929.57  \n+ 159057.20 = 2,778,986.77  \n+ 499323.77 = 3,278,310.54  \n+ 210732.40 = 3,489,042.94  \n+ 384532.44 = 3,873,575.38  \n+ 563873.27 = 4,437,448.65  \n+ 502579.13 = 4,940,027.78  \n+ 428329.11 = 5,368,356.89  \n\nThus the cumulative net profit (which “flows” into retained earnings) is 5,368,356.89.\n\nFinally, the ending “Liabilities and Owners Equity” is computed as the initial balance plus the net income accumulated. That is:\n\n 28,000,000.00 + 5,368,356.89 = 33,368,356.89\n\nWe now present the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value': '28000000.00', 'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value': '33368356.89'}}",
