                        "content": "We need to review the list of transactions and identify which ones affect the accounts payable balance. In our context only “Purchase” transactions recorded as “Unpaid” using the “Account Payable” payment method are added as liabilities to accounts payable. (Initial “deposits” or other items do not affect accounts payable; if a purchase is “Paid” through other methods it does not leave a liability.)\n\nStep‐by‐step:\n\n1. In the “Initial20231231001” entries (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) there is no AP balance recorded. So the beginning accounts payable on December 31 is zero.\n\n2. Now we inspect the “Purchase” transactions:\n  • Purchase20231231001, 20231231002, 20231231003, 20231231004, 20231231005, 20231231006 – all are “Paid” so they do not create AP.\n  • Purchase20231231007 is recorded as “Purchase” with Payment/receipt_status “Unpaid” and its payment method is “Account Payable”. Its amount is 1,000,000.0.\n  • Purchase20231231008, 09, 10, 11, 12 – are marked “Paid.”\n  • Purchase20231231013 is observed with the Payment status “Unpaid” and the payment method is “Account Payable” – its amount is 1,000,000.0.\n  • The remaining purchase transactions (Purchase20231231014, …, Purchase20231231017) are “Paid.”\n\n3. Only the two transactions that create an accounts payable balance are:\n  – Purchase20231231007: 1,000,000.00\n  – Purchase20231231013: 1,000,000.00\n\n4. Thus the ending accounts payable equals the sum of these “unpaid” purchase amounts:\n  1,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 = 2,000,000.00\n\nSo, the accounts payable balances are:\n  Initial Value: 0.00  \n  End Value: 2000000.00\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"2000000.00\"\n  }\n}",
