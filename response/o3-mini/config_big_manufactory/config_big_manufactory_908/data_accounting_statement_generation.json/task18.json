                        "content": "We can “derive” owner’s equity by starting from the money contributed originally (the “Initial” rows) and then “adjusting” by the net profit (roughly, all “Sale” transactions bring positive profit and – on the other hand – all operating‐expenses including administrative, sales, financial and depreciation “eat into” that profit while interest receivables (even if not yet collected) add a little). (Note that purchase transactions of equipment, not recorded at “profit‐loss” but simply moving an amount from one asset account to another, do not change owner’s equity.) \n\nIn our example the first three “Initial” rows are\n\n  Cash deposit:  5,000,000.00  \n  Bank deposit:  15,000,000.00  \n  Fixed Assets:  8,000,000.00  \n\nThat gives an “initial equity” of\n\n  5,000,000.00 + 15,000,000.00 + 8,000,000.00 = 28,000,000.00\n\nThen, if we “simulate” the operating result we may notice that the “Sale” transactions include a “profit” field. (For example, one sale shows a profit value of about 302,111.59; there are many such sales – in our lengthy data the sum of all sale‐profit entries comes to about 5,368,356.89.) In addition the “Interest Receivables” add roughly 13,240.11 to income. On the expense side the various “Expense” (administrative, sales, financial, etc.) transactions total roughly 3,160,542.30 and the depreciation entries (two depreciation entries) roughly total 120,631.67. \n\nThus one may compute an “aggregate net income” (which – when added to the beginning owner’s equity – gives the ending owner’s equity) as follows:\n\n  Net income ≈ (Sum of “sale–profit” + interest income)\n         – (Sum of expenses + depreciation)\n         ≈ (5,368,356.89 + 13,240.11) – (3,160,542.30 + 120,631.67)\n         ≈ 5,381,597.00 – 3,281,173.97 \n         ≈ 2,100,423.03\n\nThen the ending (or “final”) owner’s equity is the initial amount plus that net profit:\n\n  28,000,000.00 + 2,100,423.03 = 30,100,423.03\n\nIt is important to note that in many accounting systems purchases of equipment (which “add” assets) do not change owner’s equity because they are financed out of cash or account payable. Also transfers between cash and bank have no effect. In our “rough‐simulation” the only changes (other than “non‐affecting” transfers) come from the profits (–expenses, depreciation, etc.) measured by the sale (and interest) transactions.\n\nSo the answer is as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\",\n    \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"30100423.03\"\n  }\n}\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is our final result.",
