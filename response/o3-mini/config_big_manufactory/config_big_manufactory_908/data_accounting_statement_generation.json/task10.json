                        "content": "We want to know the book‐value of the “fixed assets” (that is, property‐plant–equipment and similar “non‐current assets”) at two dates. In our “data set” the procedure is as follows:\n\n1. The “Initial” entry that shows the “Fixed Assets” record gives the opening (or “initial”) value of non‑current assets. In our case that “Initial” row gives an “amount” of 8,000,000.00.\n\n2. Later “Purchase” (and “Fixed Assets Purchase”) transactions increase the asset base. (We assume that every purchase whose description (for example, product names “Heavy Equipment …”, “Heavy Machinery …”, “Industrial Facilities …” etc.) is capital in nature is added.) In our data the following transactions add to the non‑current assets (we ignore those “Expense” entries and other operating transactions):\n\n  • Purchase20231231001:  2,000,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231002:  1,500,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231003:  1,600,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231004:  500,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231005:  1,000,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231006:  1,500,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231007:  1,000,000.00  \n  • FixedAsset20231231001 (first occurrence):  1,219,968.64  \n  • FixedAsset20231231001 (second occurrence):  1,509,063.62  \n  • Purchase20231231008:  1,000,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231009:  1,000,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231010:  800,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231011:  1,600,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231012:  500,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231013:  1,000,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231014:  2,000,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231015:  1,500,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231016:  1,500,000.00  \n  • Purchase20231231017:  3,000,000.00\n\nWhen we add these up step‐by‐step we obtain:\n\n  2,000,000.00  \n  + 1,500,000.00 = 3,500,000.00  \n  + 1,600,000.00 = 5,100,000.00  \n  + 500,000.00 = 5,600,000.00  \n  + 1,000,000.00 = 6,600,000.00  \n  + 1,500,000.00 = 8,100,000.00  \n  + 1,000,000.00 = 9,100,000.00  \n  + 1,219,968.64 = 10,319,968.64  \n  + 1,509,063.62 = 11,829,032.26  \n  + 1,000,000.00 = 12,829,032.26  \n  + 1,000,000.00 = 13,829,032.26  \n  + 800,000.00 = 14,629,032.26  \n  + 1,600,000.00 = 16,229,032.26  \n  + 500,000.00 = 16,729,032.26  \n  + 1,000,000.00 = 17,729,032.26  \n  + 2,000,000.00 = 19,729,032.26  \n  + 1,500,000.00 = 21,229,032.26  \n  + 1,500,000.00 = 22,729,032.26  \n  + 3,000,000.00 = 25,729,032.26\n\nThus the total additions (the sum of all “non‐current asset purchase” transactions) is 25,729,032.26.\n\n3. Then the “final (or end‑of‑period)” gross value of the non‑current assets equals the sum of the opening (8,000,000.00) plus all the additions:\n  8,000,000.00 + 25,729,032.26 = 33,729,032.26\n\n4. Finally, “Depreciation” transactions reduce the book value of non‑current assets. In the data we see two depreciation transactions:\n  • Depreciation20240101001:  45,747.00  \n  • Depreciation20240201002:  74,884.67  \n  ------------------------------------------------  \n  Total Depreciation = 45,747.00 + 74,884.67 = 120,631.67\n\n5. So the final (“end‐of‐period”) net value of the fixed (non‑current) assets becomes:\n  33,729,032.26 – 120,631.67 = 33,608,400.59\n\nNote on rounding: We present the answers with two decimal places.\n\nIMPORTANT REMARK ON NUMERICAL SUMS:\nIt is always important to note that the “Initial Non-current Assets” value (the “opening balance”) is taken from the “Initial” record – here that is 8,000,000.00. All subsequent purchases add to the asset base and then depreciation is deducted to arrive at the end value.\n\nThus our answers are:\n\n• Total Non-current Assets Initial Value: 8,000,000.00  \n• Total Non-current Assets End Value: 33,608,400.59\n\nNow – if you compare with the sample provided with a smaller set, you see a similar structure: the “Initial” fixed asset amount is taken as is, and then all new additions minus depreciation yield the end balance.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"33608400.59\"}}",
