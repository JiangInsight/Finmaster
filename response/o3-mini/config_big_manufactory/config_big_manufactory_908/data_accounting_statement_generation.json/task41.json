                        "content": "We need to determine the net change in the Accounts Payable balance – that is, how much the balance increased (or decreased) compared with its previous value. In our Chart of Transactions the only entries that hit Accounts Payable are those “Purchase” transactions whose payment status is “Unpaid” and where the payment method indicates “Account Payable”. (Other transactions, even if large, are not relevant if they are paid from cash/bank, or affect other accounts such as interest receivable.) \n\nReviewing the transactions one‐by‐one shows that among the many lines only two purchase transactions are recorded as “Unpaid” with a payment method of “Account Payable”:\n\n1. Transaction id “Purchase20231231007”:  \n – Type: Purchase  \n – Payment status: Unpaid  \n – Payment method: Account Payable  \n – Amount: 1,000,000.00\n\n2. Transaction id “Purchase20231231013”:  \n – Type: Purchase  \n – Payment status: Unpaid  \n – Payment method: Account Payable  \n – Amount: 1,000,000.00\n\nAll the other lines either involve cash/bank transfers or are “Paid” (or affect other accounts such as receivables, depreciation, or expenses).\n\nThus, the net increase in Accounts Payable is the sum of these unpaid purchase amounts:\n\n  1,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 = 2,000,000.00\n\nThere is no offsetting (reduction) on the Accounts Payable side reported, so the final increase is 2,000,000.00.\n\nThus, in the cash flow statement the “Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable” item would show an increase of 2,000,000.00.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"2000000.00\"\n  }\n}",
