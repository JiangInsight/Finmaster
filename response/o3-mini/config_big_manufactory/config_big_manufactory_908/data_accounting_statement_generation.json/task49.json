In summary, starting with an initial cash and bank balance of 20 million, the operating activities (which include cash receipts only from the relatively few “paid” sales offset by the nearly 3.17 million of expense cash–outlays as well as the large non–cash change due to skyrocketing receivables) produce a negative net operating cash flow of about –9.45 million. On the investing side the numerous purchases of heavy equipment (including the two fixed–asset purchase entries totaling roughly 2.73 million plus the other equipment purchases which add up to about 23 million) lead to an overall cash–outflow in investing activities of about –25.73 million. When the two are added to the beginning balance the net effect is a hugely negative net increase (–35.18 million) and an ending cash balance of about –15.18 million.\n\nNote that in an actual financial statement additional details and adjustments (for example, treatment of tax payables and the precise method used to “back out” the changes in working capital) may be needed; the numbers above are based on a careful, approximate classification and summation of the sample transactions.",
