In our table only the rows whose type is “Sale” have a non–empty tax_amount value. (Other kinds of transactions—purchases, expenses, depreciation, interest, etc.—do not contribute here.) \n\nStep‑by‑step we scan the “Sale” rows and read the “tax_amount” value:\n\n• Sale20240103002 – tax_amount = 65,105.58  \n• Sale20240108007 – tax_amount = 73,047.32  \n• Sale20240109009 – tax_amount = 74,468.29  \n• Sale20240115014 – tax_amount = 33,736.90  \n• Sale20240116016 – tax_amount = 32,571.16  \n• Sale20240117018 – tax_amount = 56,232.65  \n• Sale20240118019 – tax_amount = 58,302.79  \n• Sale20240119021 – tax_amount = 57,531.80  \n• Sale20240120023 – tax_amount = 32,952.86  \n• Sale20240122024 – tax_amount = 74,966.19  \n• Sale20240123026 – tax_amount = 35,536.62  \n• Sale20240125027 – tax_amount = 100,417.33  \n• Sale20240128030 – tax_amount = 104,998.70  \n• Sale20240130032 – tax_amount = 69,226.62  \n• Sale20240202036 – tax_amount = 103,193.66  \n• Sale20240204039 – tax_amount = 100,128.96  \n• Sale20240205041 – tax_amount = 71,416.46  \n\nWe then add these up step‐by‐step:\n\n1. 65,105.58 + 73,047.32 = 138,152.90  \n2. 138,152.90 + 74,468.29 = 212,621.19  \n3. 212,621.19 + 33,736.90 = 246,358.09  \n4. 246,358.09 + 32,571.16 = 278,929.25  \n5. 278,929.25 + 56,232.65 = 335,161.90  \n6. 335,161.90 + 58,302.79 = 393,464.69  \n7. 393,464.69 + 57,531.80 = 450,996.49  \n8. 450,996.49 + 32,952.86 = 483,949.35  \n9. 483,949.35 + 74,966.19 = 558,915.54  \n10. 558,915.54 + 35,536.62 = 594,452.16  \n11. 594,452.16 + 100,417.33 = 694,869.49  \n12. 694,869.49 + 104,998.70 = 799,868.19  \n13. 799,868.19 + 69,226.62 = 869,094.81  \n14. 869,094.81 + 103,193.66 = 972,288.47  \n15. 972,288.47 + 100,128.96 = 1,072,417.43  \n16. 1,072,417.43 + 71,416.46 = 1,143,833.89  \n\nThus the total (or “end‐period”) taxes payable is 1,143,833.89.\n\nBecause none of the initial “Initial” transactions record any tax amounts, the “Taxes Payable Initial Value” is 0.00.\n\nTherefore, our final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"1143833.89\"\n  }\n}",
