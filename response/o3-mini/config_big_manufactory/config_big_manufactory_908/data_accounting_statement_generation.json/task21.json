                        "content": "We have to “build up” the “main business revenue” from only those transaction rows that record sales. In our table the only revenue‐generating entries are those whose type is “Sale” – that is, revenue from selling your product. (Other transaction types – Initial, Purchase, Expense, Depreciation, Interest, Fixed Assets, Transfers – are not part of the “main business revenue”.)\n\nOne generally‐used approach is to sum the “net” revenue recognized on each sale. (In many companies the sale is recorded net of sales taxes so that the “after_tax_amount” in the sale row gives the revenue figure – sometimes later cost of sales is subtracted to find gross profit, but the “main business revenue” is the total sales revenue.) In our table each sale row comes with many figures; we use the “after_tax_amount” field.\n\nBelow are the sale rows (their IDs and “after_tax_amount” amounts):\n\n1. Sale20240103002: after_tax_amount = 1,237,006.01  \n2. Sale20240115014: after_tax_amount = 641,001.11  \n3. Sale20240116016: after_tax_amount = 618,852.05  \n4. Sale20240117018: after_tax_amount = 1,068,420.26  \n5. Sale20240118019: after_tax_amount = 1,107,752.99  \n6. Sale20240119021: after_tax_amount = 1,093,104.15  \n7. Sale20240120023: after_tax_amount = 626,104.34  \n8. Sale20240122024: after_tax_amount = 1,424,357.58  \n9. Sale20240123026: after_tax_amount = 675,195.78  \n10. Sale20240125027: after_tax_amount = 1,907,929.30  \n11. Sale20240128030: after_tax_amount = 1,994,975.34  \n12. Sale20240130032: after_tax_amount = 1,315,305.82  \n13. Sale20240202036: after_tax_amount = 1,960,679.61  \n14. Sale20240204039: after_tax_amount = 1,902,450.17  \n15. Sale20240205041: after_tax_amount = 1,356,912.65  \n\nStep–by–step the sum is computed as follows:\n\n• After first sale: 1,237,006.01  \n• ＋ second: 1,237,006.01 + 641,001.11 = 1,878,007.12  \n• ＋ third: 1,878,007.12 + 618,852.05 = 2,496,859.17  \n• ＋ fourth: 2,496,859.17 + 1,068,420.26 = 3,565,279.43  \n• ＋ fifth: 3,565,279.43 + 1,107,752.99 = 4,673,032.42  \n• ＋ sixth: 4,673,032.42 + 1,093,104.15 = 5,766,136.57  \n• ＋ seventh: 5,766,136.57 + 626,104.34 = 6,392,240.91  \n• ＋ eighth: 6,392,240.91 + 1,424,357.58 = 7,816,598.49  \n• ＋ ninth: 7,816,598.49 + 675,195.78 = 8,491,794.27  \n• ＋ tenth: 8,491,794.27 + 1,907,929.30 = 10,399,723.57  \n• ＋ eleventh: 10,399,723.57 + 1,994,975.34 = 12,394,698.91  \n• ＋ twelfth: 12,394,698.91 + 1,315,305.82 = 13,710,004.73  \n• ＋ thirteenth: 13,710,004.73 + 1,960,679.61 = 15,670,684.34  \n• ＋ fourteenth: 15,670,684.34 + 1,902,450.17 = 17,573,134.51  \n• ＋ fifteenth: 17,573,134.51 + 1,356,912.65 = 18,930,047.16  \n\nThus, the total “after_tax_amount” across all sale transactions (i.e. the total main business revenue) is 18,930,047.16.\n\nWe then output our answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Main Business Revenue\": \"18930047.16\"\n  }\n}",
