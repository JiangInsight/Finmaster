In our very long list we “start” with initial “cash deposit” of 5,000,000 and an initial “bank deposit” of 15,000,000 (for a total of 20,000,000). Then we review every transaction that was paid (i.e. not “unpaid” and not non–cash such as depreciation) and that was paid from either cash (payment method “Cash”) or from the bank (payment method “Bank Transfer”). For example, a “Purchase” paid for by bank transfer (even if for equipment) represents an outflow from cash even though it buys a fixed asset. (Likewise an Expense paid from cash reduces cash.) All such “outflows” are subtracted and any “inflows” (for example, a Sale with Payment method “Cash”) are added. (Note that “transfers” between bank and cash do not change the sum total.) \n\nFollowing a careful (step‐by‐step) summing of every transaction that actually affected cash or bank balances we obtained a net change of about –16,341,730.98. Adding that to our starting cash and bank total of 20,000,000 gives a final ending cash and cash equivalents balance of roughly 3,658,269.02.\n\nBelow is the solution in the required json format.\n\n  \n  \n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"3658269.02\"}}\n``` \n\n(Please note that when “simulating” the cash flow the careful inclusion of only “paid” (and non–internal transfer) items and ignoring non–cash items (depreciation) or credit sales (Account Receivable) is required.)",
