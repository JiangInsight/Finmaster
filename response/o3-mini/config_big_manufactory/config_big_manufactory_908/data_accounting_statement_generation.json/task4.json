                        "content": "We must “build up” the AR balance as follows. In our books the beginning‐of–period (“Initial…”) transactions do not include any credit (“on‐account”) sales, so we start with zero. Then every “Sale” record that used “Account Receviable” in the “receive_method” (i.e. a credit sale) is “added” – and we also include the separately recorded Interest Receivables (whose receive_method is “Interest receviable”) because they represent amounts due from customers. (No receipts are recorded that would reduce those balances.) \n\nBelow is one accepted method to “reconstruct” the number:\n\n1. From the “Sale” transactions that are on credit we extract the “after_tax_amount” (because that is the amount customers owe) as follows:\n • Sale20240103002 – after_tax_amount = 1,237,006.01  \n • Sale20240108007 – 1,387,899.01  \n • Sale20240109009 – 1,414,897.50  \n • Sale20240115014 – 641,001.11  \n • Sale20240117018 – 1,124,652.91 (note: its after_tax_amount is given as 1,068,420.26 “net of tax” but the table shows the gross value in the “amount” field; here the “after_tax_amount” field is used, and the number we read on our line is 1,068,420.26 – see “Sale20240117018” below – so please note that the sale “Sale20240117018” appears with an after_tax_amount = 1,068,420.26)  \n • Sale20240118019 – 1,107,752.99  \n • Sale20240119021 – 1,093,104.15  \n • Sale20240122024 – 1,424,357.58  \n • Sale20240202036 – 1,960,679.61  \n • Sale20240204039 – 1,902,450.17  \n • Sale20240205041 – 1,356,912.65  \n\nSumming these credit‐sales gives a subtotal of about 14,594,481.04.\n\n2. Next, we add all “Interest Receivables” amounts (each one recorded with “Interest receviable” in its “receive_method”). Going line‐by‐line all the “Interest…” records (for example, from Interest20240101001, Interest20240102002, … up to Interest20240205036) the sum comes out to approximately 13,240.11.\n\n3. In our period no payment on credit sales (i.e. collections from accounts receivable) were recorded so nothing is subtracted.\n\nThus, the ending Accounts Receivable balance becomes\n\n  0 (initial) + 14,594,481.04 + 13,240.11 = 14,607,721.15\n\nWe then present our answer (rounding to 2 decimals) in our required JSON format.\n\nNote:\n• Although the “Sale” row for 2024‑01‑17 in our data shows an “after_tax_amount” of 1,068,420.26 in one column, the figure used for AR here is always the “after_tax_amount” as recorded. (In our reconstruction the small differences are due to following the printed amounts record‐by‐record.)\n• Transfers among cash or bank do not affect AR, so they are ignored.\n\nThus, the result is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accounts Receivable End Value': '14607721.15'} }",
