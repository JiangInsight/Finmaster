In our case the “Initial” lines (cash, bank, fixed assets) do not include inventory items, so the beginning inventory is zero.\n\nStep 1. Gather all purchase transactions that add to inventory (ignoring any fixed asset acquisition):\n\n• Purchase20231231001: Product P003 (“Heavy Equipment C”): 2 units at 1,000,000 each → Total = 2,000,000  \n• Purchase20231231002: Product P004 (“Heavy Equipment D”): 1 unit at 1,500,000 → Total = 1,500,000  \n• Purchase20231231003: Product P002 (“Heavy Equipment B”): 2 units at 800,000 each → Total = 1,600,000  \n• Purchase20231231004: Product P001 (“Heavy Equipment A”): 1 unit at 500,000 → Total = 500,000  \n• Purchase20231231005: Product P001 (“Heavy Equipment A”): 2 units at 500,000 → Total = 1,000,000  \n• Purchase20231231006: Product P004 (“Heavy Equipment D”): 1 unit at 1,500,000 → Total = 1,500,000  \n• Purchase20231231007: Product P003 (“Heavy Equipment C”): 1 unit at 1,000,000 → Total = 1,000,000  \n• Purchase20231231008: Product P003 (“Heavy Equipment C”): 1 unit at 1,000,000 → Total = 1,000,000  \n• Purchase20231231009: Product P003 (“Heavy Equipment C”): 1 unit at 1,000,000 → Total = 1,000,000  \n• Purchase20231231010: Product P002 (“Heavy Equipment B”): 1 unit at 800,000 → Total = 800,000  \n• Purchase20231231011: Product P003 (“Heavy Equipment C”): 1 unit at 1,000,000 → Total = 1,000,000  \n• Purchase20231231012: Product P001 (“Heavy Equipment A”): 1 unit at 500,000 → Total = 500,000  \n• Purchase20231231013: Product P001 (“Heavy Equipment A”): 2 units at 500,000 → Total = 1,000,000  \n• Purchase20231231014: Product P003 (“Heavy Equipment C”): 2 units at 1,000,000 → Total = 2,000,000  \n• Purchase20231231015: Product P004 (“Heavy Equipment D”): 1 unit at 1,500,000 → Total = 1,500,000  \n• Purchase20231231016: Product P004 (“Heavy Equipment D”): 1 unit at 1,500,000 → Total = 1,500,000  \n• Purchase20231231017: Product P004 (“Heavy Equipment D”): 2 units at 1,500,000 → Total = 3,000,000  \n\nNow, grouping by product:\n\n• P001 (“Heavy Equipment A”):\n Purchases: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6 units at 500,000 each → Total cost = 6 × 500,000 = 3,000,000\n\n• P002 (“Heavy Equipment B”):\n Purchases: 2 + 1 = 3 units at 800,000 each → Total cost = 3 × 800,000 = 2,400,000\n\n• P003 (“Heavy Equipment C”):\n Purchases: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 8 units at 1,000,000 each → Total cost = 8 × 1,000,000 = 8,000,000\n\n• P004 (“Heavy Equipment D”):\n Purchases: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6 units at 1,500,000 each → Total cost = 6 × 1,500,000 = 9,000,000\n\nThe total cost of purchases (which become inventory) is then 3,000,000 + 2,400,000 + 8,000,000 + 9,000,000 = 22,400,000.\n\nStep 2. Sum up the “Sale” transactions that remove inventory (we assume that the “cost amount” on sale is the cost of the sold item; here we simply “remove” the corresponding cost once an item is sold).\n\nList the sales by product:\n\n• P001 (“Heavy Equipment A”):\n Sales:\n  Sale20240115014: 1 unit (cost = 500,000)\n  Sale20240116016: 1 unit (500,000)\n  Sale20240120023: 1 unit (500,000)\n  Sale20240123026: 1 unit (500,000)\n Total = 4 units → Total cost = 4 × 500,000 = 2,000,000\n\n• P002 (“Heavy Equipment B”):\n Sales:\n  Sale20240117018: 1 unit (800,000)\n  Sale20240118019: 1 unit (800,000)\n  Sale20240119021: 1 unit (800,000)\n Total = 3 units → Total cost = 3 × 800,000 = 2,400,000\n\n• P003 (“Heavy Equipment C”):\n Sales:\n  Sale20240103002: 1 unit (1,000,000)\n  Sale20240122024: 1 unit (1,000,000)\n  Sale20240130032: 1 unit (1,000,000)\n  Sale20240205041: 1 unit (1,000,000)\n Total = 4 units → Total cost = 4 × 1,000,000 = 4,000,000\n\n• P004 (“Heavy Equipment D”):\n Sales:\n  Sale20240125027: 1 unit (1,500,000)\n  Sale20240128030: 1 unit (1,500,000)\n  Sale20240202036: 1 unit (1,500,000)\n  Sale20240204039: 1 unit (1,500,000)\n Total = 4 units → Total cost = 4 × 1,500,000 = 6,000,000\n\nNow sum the cost of goods sold: 2,000,000 + 2,400,000 + 4,000,000 + 6,000,000 = 14,400,000.\n\nStep 3. The ending inventory value is the cost of purchases – cost of sold inventory:\n  22,400,000 – 14,400,000 = 8,000,000\n\nSince no inventory was on hand at the beginning (initial inventory value is zero), we have:\n\n• Inventory Initial Value = 0.00  \n• Inventory End Value = 8,000,000.00\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Inventory End Value\": \"8000000.00\"\n  }\n}",
