From all the “Sale” transactions, we added the “amount” fields to get the Total Revenue (and hence the Main Business Revenue). In our case the sum of all sale amounts came to 18,768,356.89.\n\n2. For the cost side we summed the “cost_amount” fields on each sale. Their total was 13,400,000.00. This figure serves both as “Cost of Goods Sold” and “Total Cost.”\n\n3. Gross Profit is obtained as Total Revenue less Cost of Goods Sold, i.e. 18,768,356.89 – 13,400,000.00 = 5,368,356.89.\n\n4. Next the operating expenses were aggregated. We summed the Administrative Expenses separately (from each “Administrative Expenses” row) to get 990,424.48 and the Selling Expenses (from each “Sales Expenses” row) to get 1,370,422.26.\n\n5. Depreciation was taken from the two depreciation entries (4,5747.0 and 74,884.67) summing to 120,631.67.\n\n6. Financial Expenses were summed from their respective expense entries to total 632,582.44.\n\n7. Total Expenses equals the sum of Administrative, Selling, Depreciation and Financial Expenses: 990,424.48 + 1,370,422.26 + 120,631.67 + 632,582.44 = 3,114,060.85.\n\n8. All the “Interest Receivables” entries (aside from one negative adjustment) were summed to yield an Interest Income of 13,240.11.\n\n9. Profit Before Tax is calculated as Gross Profit less Total Expenses plus Interest Income: 5,368,356.89 – 3,114,060.85 + 13,240.11 = 2,267,536.15.\n\n10. Assuming a tax rate of roughly 20% (in line with the example’s approximate ratio) the Tax Expense is 20% of Profit Before Tax, about 453,507.23.\n\n11. Finally, Net Profit is Profit Before Tax minus Tax Expense, 2,267,536.15 – 453,507.23 = 1,814,028.92.\n\nThe above income statement values have been rounded to two decimals and presented in the required JSON format.",
