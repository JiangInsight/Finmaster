In our case the huge table has many kinds of entries. (Note that “Interest Receivables” may eventually be operating receipts, but if the “payment/receipt_status” is “Unpaid” no cash has actually moved.) \n\nFor example, in our file we discard \n • the “Initial” lines (“Cash deposit”, “Bank deposit”, “Fixed Assets”) \n • all “Purchase…” entries that buy heavy equipment (which are capital expenditures—investing cash flows) \n • “Fixed Asset …” lines and “Transfer…” lines (transfers between accounts)\n\nThen we include (with a “–” sign for cash‐outflows) only those rows which are “Expense…” (administrative, sales, financial, etc) provided the “payment/receipt_status” is “Paid” and those “Sale…” entries provided that they are “Paid” (if “Unpaid” the cash hasn’t been received).\n\nA careful step–by–step “by hand” processing of the rows gives (approximately):\n\nOperating outflows (expenses) – the sum of all paid operating expense amounts comes out to about 3,285,464.64  \nOperating inflows (sales receipts) – the sum of all paid sales amounts comes out to about 7,514,065.92\n\nSubtracting expenses from receipts we get a net operating cash flow of\n\n  7,514,065.92 – 3,285,464.64 = 4,228,601.28\n\nThus the final “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities” (to two decimal places) is 4,228,601.28.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"4228601.28\"} }\n```",
