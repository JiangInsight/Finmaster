                        "content": "We must “build” the income‐statement by taking only those transactions that affect revenue or expense. In our “book” the following groups contribute:\n\n• Revenues come only from the “Sale” and “Interest Receivables” entries. (Initial “cash” or “purchase” or “transfer” lines change the balance sheet but do not appear on the income statement.)  \n• Expenses come from “Expense” (of any kind: Administrative, Sales, Financial), from “Depreciation” and (if any) negative interest amounts.\n\nThen the (final) net income is computed as\n\n  net profit = (sum of incomes) – (sum of expenses).\n\nBecause the table is long we briefly explain our procedure:\n\n1. For every row whose “type” is “Sale” we take the “profit” column. In our data the Sales entries are (by id):\n  Sale20240103002 (profit = 302111.59),\n  Sale20240108007 (460946.33),\n  Sale20240109009 (489365.79),\n  Sale20240115014 (174738.01),\n  Sale20240116016 (151423.21),\n  Sale20240117018 (324652.91),\n  Sale20240118019 (366055.78),\n  Sale20240119021 (350635.95),\n  Sale20240120023 (159057.20),\n  Sale20240122024 (499323.77),\n  Sale20240123026 (210732.40),\n  Sale20240125027 (508346.63),\n  Sale20240128030 (599974.04),\n  Sale20240130032 (384532.44),\n  Sale20240202036 (563873.27),\n  Sale20240204039 (502579.13) and\n  Sale20240205041 (428329.11).\n\nWhen summed these “Sale” profits total about 6,476,677.56.\n\n2. For every “Interest Receivables” row that is positive we add the “amount” (if a row shows a negative amount, we include it as an expense). When summing all interest entries (for example, 1157.0, 1023.5, 890.0, 756.5, …, etc.) we got a total of about 13,240.11.\n\nThus the total “income” equals\n  6,476,677.56 + 13,240.11 ≈ 6,489,917.67.\n\n3. Next we add up every “Expense” (Administrtive, Sales, Financial)–plus the “Depreciation” rows. (For example, on 2024‑01‑01 there are Administrative 27,665.22 and Financial 85,147.37; there is also a Depreciation for 45,747.0; etc.) When summing all of these lines (ignoring the balance‐sheet entries such as Purchase or Initial or Transfers) we obtain a total “expense” of about 3,779,012.56.\n\n4. Finally, (net profit) = 6,489,917.67 – 3,779,012.56 ≈ 2,710,905.11.\n\nThus the final computed net profit is about +2,710,905.11.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"2710905.11\"}}",
