                        "content": "We note that none of the “Initial…” rows create a liability (they simply set up your asset balances). In the ongoing period the only transactions that record amounts still “Unpaid” (and so still in the books as current liabilities) are the purchase entries “Purchase20231231007” and “Purchase20231231013”. In our data these two entries are as follows:\n\n• Purchase20231231007 – a “Purchase” with payment/receipt_status “Unpaid” for an amount of 1,000,000.00  \n• Purchase20231231013 – a “Purchase” with payment/receipt_status “Unpaid” for an amount of 1,000,000.00\n\nAll other transactions (even if they are “Interest Receivables”, “Depreciation”, “Expense” or “Fixed Assets”) are not recorded in current liabilities. (In our sample example the “Interest receivables” are treated on the asset side.)\n\nThus, at the very beginning (initial balance date) current liabilities are 0.00, and at the end the sum of the unpaid purchase amounts is:\n\n  1,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 = 2,000,000.00\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"2000000.00\"\n  }\n}",
