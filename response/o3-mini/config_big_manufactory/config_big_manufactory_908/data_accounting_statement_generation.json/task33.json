                        "content": "We can “derive” the tax‐expense simply by noticing that—in our books the “Sale” transactions carry a “tax_amount” (the tax collected/charged on the sale). In many computerized accounting systems the tax‐expense is recorded on sale transactions by storing the tax liability as a “tax_amount” field. (Sometimes one might calculate income tax on the profit, but here the posting shows that each sale has its own tax sub‐amount already, and then the “final tax expense” is simply the total of those amounts.) \n\nFor example, the sample problem had several sale transactions whose “tax_amount” fields add up to 271550.92, and that was our final tax‐expense item.\n\nIn our current “Heavy Equipment” problem the table includes many transactions. The only rows with a tax component are those of type “Sale.” (All other types do not report a tax_amount.) For each Sale row the “tax_amount” is shown in that “tax_amount” column. Our task is then to sum up these tax_amount values from all the sale transactions.\n\nListing the “Sale” rows (only the important columns are shown):\n\n1. Sale20240103002: tax_amount = 65,105.58  \n2. Sale20240108007: tax_amount = 73,047.32  \n3. Sale20240109009: tax_amount = 74,468.29  \n4. Sale20240115014: tax_amount = 33,736.90  \n5. Sale20240116016: tax_amount = 32,571.16  \n6. Sale20240117018: tax_amount = 56,232.65  \n7. Sale20240118019: tax_amount = 58,302.79  \n8. Sale20240119021: tax_amount = 57,531.80  \n9. Sale20240120023: tax_amount = 32,952.86  \n10. Sale20240122024: tax_amount = 74,966.19  \n11. Sale20240123026: tax_amount = 35,536.62  \n12. Sale20240125027: tax_amount = 100,417.33  \n13. Sale20240128030: tax_amount = 104,998.70  \n14. Sale20240130032: tax_amount = 69,226.62  \n15. Sale20240202036: tax_amount = 103,193.66  \n16. Sale20240204039: tax_amount = 100,128.96  \n17. Sale20240205041: tax_amount = 71,416.46  \n\nWe then sum these amounts step‐by‐step:\n\n– First grouping a few values:  \n 65105.58 + 73047.32 = 138152.90  \n 74468.29 + 33736.90 = 108205.19  \n 32571.16 + 56232.65 = 88,803.81  \n 58302.79 + 57531.80 = 115834.59  \n 32952.86 + 74966.19 = 107919.05  \n 35536.62 + 100417.33 = 135953.95  \n 104998.70 + 69226.62 = 174225.32  \n 103193.66 + 100128.96 = 203322.62  \nThen add the final remaining value of 71,416.46.\n\nNow adding these group‐sums sequentially:\n\n• 138152.90 + 108205.19 = 246358.09  \n• 246358.09 + 88803.81 = 335161.90  \n• 335161.90 + 115834.59 = 450996.49  \n• 450996.49 + 107919.05 = 558915.54  \n• 558915.54 + 135953.95 = 694869.49  \n• 694869.49 + 174225.32 = 869094.81  \n• 869094.81 + 203322.62 = 1,072,417.43  \n• Finally, 1,072,417.43 + 71416.46 = 1,143,833.89\n\nThus the total tax “expense” for the period is 1,143,833.89.\n\nSo, in our required output format the result is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n     \"Tax Expense\": \"1143833.89\"\n  }\n}",
