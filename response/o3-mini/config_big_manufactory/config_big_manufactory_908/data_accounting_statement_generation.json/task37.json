In this data the depreciation expense appears as a separate transaction (or transactions) which is later “added back” when preparing the cash flow statement because depreciation is a non‐cash expense.\n\nLooking at the table, we find the rows whose “type” is Depreciation. In our current problem we have two entries:\n\n1. Row with id “Depreciation20240101001” on 2024‑01‑01 has an amount of 45747.0.\n2. Row with id “Depreciation20240201002” on 2024‑02‑01 has an amount of 74884.67 \n   (the raw value is 74884.66999999998, which rounds to 74884.67).\n\nBecause in preparing a cash flow statement (for a defined period) the “depreciation” item is the sum of all depreciation expenses during that period, we add these two amounts together.\n\nCalculation:\n  45747.0 + 74884.67 = 120631.67\n\nThus, the final depreciation item to be reported is 120631.67.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Depreciation\": \"120631.67\"}}",
