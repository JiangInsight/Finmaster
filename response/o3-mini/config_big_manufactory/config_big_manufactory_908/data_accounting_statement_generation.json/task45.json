In our process we treat as investing only those transactions that affect the purchase or sale of long‐term assets (for example, heavy equipment, fixed assets, etc.). Note that the “Initial” entries (the beginning–of–period opening balances for cash or for fixed assets) are not “cash‐flow events” even if they set up the balance‐sheet values. Only actual “investing” transactions cause a change in cash. In our file the following rows are “investing” in nature (with (–) indicating cash outflow when buying a fixed asset and (+) a cash inflow when selling one):\n\n• Row 4: A Purchase of Heavy Equipment C for 2,000,000.0 (Paid by bank transfer) → –2,000,000.0  \n• Row 9: A Purchase of Heavy Equipment D for 1,500,000.0 → –1,500,000.0  \n• Row 10: A Purchase of Heavy Equipment B for 1,600,000.0 → –1,600,000.0  \n• Row 14: A Sale of Heavy Equipment C for 1,302,111.59 (though “Unpaid” its eventual receipt is an investing inflow) → +1,302,111.59  \n• Row 15: A Purchase of Heavy Equipment A for 500,000.0 → –500,000.0  \n• Row 16: A Purchase of Heavy Equipment A for 1,000,000.0 → –1,000,000.0  \n• Row 19: A Purchase of Heavy Equipment D for 1,500,000.0 → –1,500,000.0  \n• Row 29: A “Fixed Assets Purchase” (recorded separately) for 1,219,968.64 → –1,219,968.64  \n• Row 32: A Sale of Heavy Equipment C for 1,460,946.33 → +1,460,946.33  \n• Row 35: A Sale of Heavy Equipment C for 1,489,365.79 → +1,489,365.79  \n• Row 36: A Purchase of Heavy Equipment C for 1,000,000.0 → –1,000,000.0  \n• Row 42: A “Fixed Assets Purchase” for 1,509,063.62 → –1,509,063.62  \n• Row 51: A Purchase of Heavy Equipment C for 1,000,000.0 → –1,000,000.0  \n• Row 54: A Sale of Heavy Equipment A for 674,738.01 → +674,738.01  \n• Row 57: A Sale of Heavy Equipment A for 651,423.21 → +651,423.21  \n• Row 61: A Sale of Heavy Equipment B for 1,124,652.91 → +1,124,652.91  \n• Row 62: A Purchase of Heavy Equipment B for 800,000.0 → –800,000.0  \n• Row 66: A Sale of Heavy Equipment B for 1,166,055.78 → +1,166,055.78  \n• Row 67: A Purchase of Heavy Equipment B for 1,600,000.0 → –1,600,000.0  \n• Row 71: A Sale of Heavy Equipment B for 1,150,635.95 → +1,150,635.95  \n• Row 72: A Purchase of Heavy Equipment A for 500,000.0 → –500,000.0  \n• Row 76: A Sale of Heavy Equipment A for 659,057.20 → +659,057.20  \n• Row 83: A Sale of Heavy Equipment C for 1,499,323.77 → +1,499,323.77  \n• Row 84: A Purchase of Heavy Equipment C for 2,000,000.0 → –2,000,000.0  \n• Row 88: A Sale of Heavy Equipment A for 710,732.40 → +710,732.40  \n• Row 97: A Sale of Heavy Equipment D for 2,008,346.63 → +2,008,346.63  \n• Row 99: A Purchase of Heavy Equipment D for 1,500,000.0 → –1,500,000.0  \n• Row 116: A Sale of Heavy Equipment D for 2,099,974.04 → +2,099,974.04  \n• Row 120: A Purchase of Heavy Equipment D for 1,500,000.0 → –1,500,000.0  \n• Row 126: A Sale of Heavy Equipment C for 1,384,532.44 → +1,384,532.44  \n• Row 134: A Sale of Heavy Equipment D for 2,063,873.27 → +2,063,873.27  \n• Row 141: A Sale of Heavy Equipment D for 2,002,579.13 → +2,002,579.13  \n• Row 144: A Sale of Heavy Equipment C for 1,428,329.11 → +1,428,329.11  \n• Row 145: A Purchase of Heavy Equipment D for 3,000,000.0 → –3,000,000.0  \n• Row 42 through row 145 (and others below) have many “transfer‐free” investing events.
