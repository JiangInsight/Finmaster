                        "content": "We must “reverse‐convert” all sales made on credit so that an increase in AR is shown as a use (hence a negative adjustment in the cash flow statement). In our case the only transactions that affect accounts receivable are the “Sale” entries whose “receive_method” is “Account Receviable.” (Other sale entries with “Cash” do not generate receivables.) We list them below – note that in this problem all such sales remain “Unpaid” (so the entire sale amount is recorded in receivables):\n\n• Sale20240103002 – amount = 1,302,111.59  \n• Sale20240108007 – amount = 1,460,946.33  \n• Sale20240109009 – amount = 1,489,365.79  \n• Sale20240115014 – amount = 674,738.01  \n• Sale20240117018 – amount = 1,124,652.91  \n• Sale20240118019 – amount = 1,166,055.78  \n• Sale20240119021 – amount = 1,150,635.95  \n• Sale20240122024 – amount = 1,499,323.77  \n• Sale20240202036 – amount = 2,063,873.27  \n• Sale20240204039 – amount = 2,002,579.13  \n• Sale20240205041 – amount = 1,428,329.11  \n\nStep–by–step we sum these amounts:\n  1) 1,302,111.59 + 1,460,946.33 = 2,763,057.92  \n  2) 2,763,057.92 + 1,489,365.79 = 4,252,423.71  \n  3) 4,252,423.71 + 674,738.01 = 4,927,161.72  \n  4) 4,927,161.72 + 1,124,652.91 = 6,051,814.63  \n  5) 6,051,814.63 + 1,166,055.78 = 7,217,870.41  \n  6) 7,217,870.41 + 1,150,635.95 = 8,368,506.36  \n  7) 8,368,506.36 + 1,499,323.77 = 9,867,830.13  \n  8) 9,867,830.13 + 2,063,873.27 = 11,931,703.40  \n  9) 11,931,703.40 + 2,002,579.13 = 13,934,282.53  \n  10) 13,934,282.53 + 1,428,329.11 = 15,362,611.64  \n\nThus, assuming that the beginning (prior period) AR balance was zero (no AR at the start), the ending accounts receivable is 15,362,611.64. In the cash flow statement the “Increase in Accounts Receivable” is shown as a reduction in operating cash. Therefore we record it with a minus sign:\n\n\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" = –15,362,611.64\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-15362611.64\"}}",
