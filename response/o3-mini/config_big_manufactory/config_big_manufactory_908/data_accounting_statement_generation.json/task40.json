                        "content": "We need to “re‐build” the inventory balance using only those transactions that “add” or “remove” items “for resale” (that is, non–fixed‐asset items) –– that is, the purchases that add to stock and the sales in which the sold cost is “written off” (COGS).\n\nStep 1. Identify the purchase transactions (not the fixed–asset purchase) that add to inventory. For each such row the “amount” (or equivalently, quantity×unit price) is the cost added. In our table the following Purchase rows (by id) are for inventory:\n • Purchase20231231001: Heavy Equipment C  \n  • Amount = 2,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231002: Heavy Equipment D  \n  • Amount = 1,500,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231003: Heavy Equipment B  \n  • Amount = 1,600,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231004: Heavy Equipment A  \n  • Amount = 500,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231005: Heavy Equipment A  \n  • Amount = 1,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231006: Heavy Equipment D  \n  • Amount = 1,500,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231007: Heavy Equipment C  \n  • Amount = 1,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231008: Heavy Equipment C  \n  • Amount = 1,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231009: Heavy Equipment C  \n  • Amount = 1,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231010: Heavy Equipment B  \n  • Amount = 800,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231011: Heavy Equipment C  \n  • Amount = 1,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231012: Heavy Equipment A  \n  • Amount = 500,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231013: Heavy Equipment A  \n  • Amount = 1,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231014: Heavy Equipment C  \n  • Amount = 2,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231015: Heavy Equipment D  \n  • Amount = 1,500,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231016: Heavy Equipment D  \n  • Amount = 1,500,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231017: Heavy Equipment D  \n  • Amount = 3,000,000.0  \n\nSum of purchases =\n 2,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,600,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 800,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,500,000 + 3,000,000  \n    = 22,400,000.0\n\nStep 2. Identify the sale transactions that “remove” inventory. In these sales the “cost_amount” represents the cost of the goods sold (COGS). Listed “Sale” rows are (with the corresponding cost_amount):\n\n 1. Sale20240103002 (Heavy Equipment C): 1,000,000.0  \n 2. Sale20240108007 (Heavy Equipment C): 1,000,000.0  \n 3. Sale20240109009 (Heavy Equipment C): 1,000,000.0  \n 4. Sale20240115014 (Heavy Equipment A): 500,000.0  \n 5. Sale20240116016 (Heavy Equipment A): 500,000.0  \n 6. Sale20240117018 (Heavy Equipment B): 800,000.0  \n 7. Sale20240118019 (Heavy Equipment B): 800,000.0  \n 8. Sale20240119021 (Heavy Equipment B): 800,000.0  \n 9. Sale20240120023 (Heavy Equipment A): 500,000.0  \n 10. Sale20240122024 (Heavy Equipment C): 1,000,000.0  \n 11. Sale20240123026 (Heavy Equipment A): 500,000.0  \n 12. Sale20240125027 (Heavy Equipment D): 1,500,000.0  \n 13. Sale20240128030 (Heavy Equipment D): 1,500,000.0  \n 14. Sale20240130032 (Heavy Equipment C): 1,000,000.0  \n 15. Sale20240202036 (Heavy Equipment D): 1,500,000.0  \n 16. Sale20240204039 (Heavy Equipment D): 1,500,000.0  \n 17. Sale20240205041 (Heavy Equipment C): 1,000,000.0\n\nNow sum the COGS from sales:\n = 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 + 800,000 + 800,000 + 800,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,000,000  \n    = 16,400,000.0\n\nStep 3. (Ending Inventory Change) = Purchases (added to inventory) – Cost of Goods Sold (inventory removed)\n  = 22,400,000.0 – 16,400,000.0  \n  = 6,000,000.0\n\nStep 4. In the cash flow statement the “Increase in Inventory” is a use of cash so it is shown with a negative sign. Thus, the final line item for “(Increase) Decrease in Inventory” is –6,000,000.00\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-6000000.00\"\n  }\n}",
