In this dataset the only transactions that are “Fixed Assets Purchase” (that is, they come in a row whose type is “Fixed Assets Purchase”) are the following two rows:\n\n• Row 1:\n  id: FixedAsset20231231001, type: Fixed Assets Purchase, amount: 1219968.64  \n• Row 2:\n  id: FixedAsset20231231001, type: Fixed Assets Purchase, amount: 1509063.62\n\n(The other rows for “Purchase” that do not fill in any asset details are for other kinds of purchases; also the initial “Fixed Assets” row is just the opening balance and is not a purchase during the period.)\n\nSo, the purchase of fixed assets during the period is obtained by summing these two fixed asset purchase transactions:\n\n  1219968.64 + 1509063.62 = 2729032.26\n\nThus, the final purchase of fixed assets in the cash flow statement is 2729032.26.\n\nWe now present the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"2729032.26\"}}",
