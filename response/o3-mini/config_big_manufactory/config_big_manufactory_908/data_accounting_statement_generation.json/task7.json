                        "content": "We need to “build up” the gross level of fixed‐assets (that is, “Fixed Assets” on the balance–sheet) by starting with the “Initial” balance for fixed assets and then adding every acquisition that is to be capitalized – whether the acquisition comes in with a “Purchase” record (here the items are “Heavy Equipment …”) or with an explicit “Fixed Assets Purchase” record – and then subtracting depreciation.\n\nLet’s explain step‐by–step.\n\n1. From the initial entries (all dated 2023‑12‑31) you see three records. Only one of them is for fixed assets. Its “amount” is 8,000,000.0. This is taken as the beginning “Fixed Assets” balance.\n\n  Initial Fixed Assets = 8,000,000.00\n\n2. Next, go through the “Purchase” transactions that are “capital purchases” (the product names begin with “Heavy Equipment …”) and add their “amount” fields. (Even if the payment status is “Unpaid,” the acquisition enters the balance sheet at its cost.) The following purchases are present (each dated 2023‑12‑31):\n\n  • Purchase20231231001: 2,000,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231002: 1,500,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231003: 1,600,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231004: 500,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231005: 1,000,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231006: 1,500,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231007: 1,000,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231008: 1,000,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231009: 1,000,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231010: 800,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231011: 500,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231013: 1,000,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231014: 2,000,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231015: 1,500,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231016: 1,500,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231017: 3,000,000.0\n\nLet’s add these up:\n\n  2,000,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 3,500,000  \n  + 1,600,000 = 5,100,000  \n  +   500,000 = 5,600,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 6,600,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 8,100,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 9,100,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 10,100,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 11,100,000  \n  +   800,000 = 11,900,000  \n  +   500,000 = 12,400,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 13,400,000  \n  + 2,000,000 = 15,400,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 16,900,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 18,400,000  \n  + 3,000,000 = 21,400,000\n\nSo the purchase‐based acquisitions total 21,400,000.0\n\n3. In addition, there are transactions whose type is “Fixed Assets Purchase.” (They are usually recorded separately.) In our data there are two of these:\n\n  • FixedAsset20231231001 with amount = 1,219,968.64  \n  • FixedAsset20231231001 (a later one) with amount = 1,509,063.62\n\nThe total from these fixed–asset–specific entries is\n\n  1,219,968.64 + 1,509,063.62 = 2,729,032.26\n\n4. Now the total “additions” (or acquisitions) to fixed assets equals the sum of the purchase–based acquisitions plus the fixed asset purchase entries:\n  Total additions = 21,400,000.0 + 2,729,032.26 = 24,129,032.26\n\n5. Add this to the initial fixed assets to obtain the “gross” fixed assets before depreciation:\n  Gross Fixed Assets = 8,000,000.00 + 24,129,032.26 = 32,129,032.26\n\n6. Next, subtract depreciation. In our data the depreciation transactions are:\n\n  • Depreciation20240101001 for 45,747.0  \n  • Depreciation20240201002 for 74,884.67\n\nTotal depreciation = 45,747.0 + 74,884.67 = 120,631.67\n\n7. Finally, the ending fixed assets balance is:\n  Fixed Assets End Value = 32,129,032.26 – 120,631.67 = 32,008,400.59\n\nThus we have:\n\n  Fixed Assets Initial Value: 8,000,000.00  \n  Fixed Assets End Value: 32,008,400.59\n\nBelow is the answer according to the requested json format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"32008400.59\"\n  }\n}",
