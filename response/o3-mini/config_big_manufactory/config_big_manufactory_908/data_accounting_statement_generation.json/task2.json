                        "content": "We “see” that in this problem the bank‐deposit account starts with an “Initial” bank deposit record and then many transactions using “Bank Transfer” (and some “Transfer” moves) change the cash balance kept in the bank. One method is to “simulate” the flows that hit the bank account:\n\n1. Look at the starting “Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit” record. Its amount is 15,000,000.00. (This is the “initial bank deposit‐value”.)\n\n2. Then add up every transaction where money is withdrawn from the bank. In our table these include all payments that use “Bank Transfer” as payment (or – in the case of a fixed asset purchase paid by bank, then money is drawn from the bank) – for example, the purchase of Heavy Equipment in rows whose payment method is “Bank Transfer.” (We must ignore transactions paid by Cash or “Account Payable” – if not yet paid from bank.)\n\n3. Also include the “Transfer” records. Often a “Cash to bank transfer” will add an amount into the bank account while a “Bank to cash transfer” subtracts money. (The identifiers in our “type” field tell you which kind of transfer each is.)\n\nIn our detailed review (see step‐by‐step “simulation” below for a representative explanation), we “pick” out the following contributions:\n\nA. The starting bank‐deposit is +15,000,000.00.\n\nB. “Purchase” records that are paid by bank transfer (or “Bank Transfer” payment method) subtract:\n  • Purchase20231231001 (–2,000,000.00)\n  • Purchase20231231002 (–1,500,000.00)\n  • Purchase20231231004 (–500,000.00)\n  • Purchase20231231005 (–1,000,000.00)\n  • Purchase20231231006 (–1,500,000.00)\n  • FixedAsset20231231001 (Heavy Assets purchase) (–1,219,968.64)\n  • Purchase20231231008 (–1,000,000.00)\n  • Purchase20231231010 (–800,000.00)\n  • Purchase20231231011 (–1,600,000.00)\n  • Purchase20231231012 (–500,000.00)\n  • Purchase20231231014 (–2,000,000.00)\n  • Purchase20231231017 (–3,000,000.00)\n  – Summing these gives a total “bank‐withdrawal” via purchases of –16,619,968.64.\n\nC. Next, “Transfer” records that affect the bank deposit:\n  • Several “Cash to bank transfer” entries add +1,000,000.00 each while “Bank to cash transfer” entries subtract –1,000,000.00. When we add them up the net effect of all transfer records is +3,000,000.00.\n\nThus, starting with 15,000,000.00 and then:\n  15,000,000.00 + 3,000,000.00 = 18,000,000.00 (after transfers)\nSubtract the “bank paid–out” total of 16,619,968.64:\n  18,000,000.00 – 16,619,968.64 = 1,380,031.36\n\nThat is our ending bank deposit balance.\n\nSo finally we have:\n\n• Bank Deposits Initial Value = 15,000,000.00 \n• Bank Deposits End Value = 1,380,031.36\n\nBelow is the final answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"15000000.00\",\n    \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"1380031.36\"\n  }\n}\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────\nNote on the reasoning:\n• We “filtered” only the transactions that change bank cash – that is, those with “Bank Transfer” (purchases and fixed asset payments) and the “Transfer” records (“Cash to bank” increases, “Bank to cash” decreases).\n• Other transactions (paid in Cash or with “Account Payable”) are assumed not to affect the bank deposit account immediately.\n\nThis yields the above results.",
