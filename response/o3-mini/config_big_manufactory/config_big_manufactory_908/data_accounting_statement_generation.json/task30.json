Identify only rows whose “type” begins with “Expense” or “Depreciation.” (For example, ignore “Initial”, “Purchase”, “Sale”, “Interest Receivables”, “Fixed Assets Purchase”, “Transfer”, etc.)\n\n2. From the table the following rows (by their “id”) are included and their “amount” values are:\n\n  • Expense20240101001 – Administrative Expenses: 27,665.22  \n  • Expense20240101001 – Financial Expenses: 85,147.37  \n  • Depreciation20240101001 – Depreciation: 45,747.00  \n  • Expense20240102001 – Administrative Expenses: 78,979.22  \n  • Expense20240102001 – Sales Expenses: 93,842.80  \n  • Expense20240103001 – Sales Expenses: 72,054.07  \n  • Expense20240104001 – Administrative Expenses: 96,158.64  \n  • Expense20240105001 – Administrative Expenses: 58,160.20  \n  • Expense20240105001 – Sales Expenses: 12,403.65  \n  • Expense20240106001 – Financial Expenses: 80,927.47  \n  • Expense20240106001 – Sales Expenses: 55,244.67  \n  • Expense20240107001 – Sales Expenses: 90,710.35  \n  • Expense20240108001 – Sales Expenses: 38,143.60  \n  • Expense20240109001 – Sales Expenses: 15,569.62  \n  • Expense20240109001 – Sales Expenses: 82,068.28  \n  • Expense20240110001 – Administrative Expenses: 11,242.06  \n  • Expense20240111001 – Administrative Expenses: 93,771.10  \n  • Expense20240111001 – Administrative Expenses: 84,202.53  \n  • Expense20240112001 – Sales Expenses: 86,165.15  \n  • Expense20240113001 – Administrative Expenses: 45,256.88  \n  • Expense20240113001 – Financial Expenses: 86,582.27  \n  • Expense20240114001 – Sales Expenses: 49,553.54  \n  • Expense20240115001 – Sales Expenses: 77,935.63  \n  • Expense20240116001 – Sales Expenses: 46,003.89  \n  • Expense20240116001 – Administrative Expenses: 16,712.52  \n  • Expense20240117001 – Financial Expenses: 12,485.39  \n  • Expense20240117001 – Administrative Expenses: 76,658.64  \n  • Expense20240118001 – Financial Expenses: 23,920.73  \n  • Expense20240118001 – Sales Expenses: 73,389.05  \n  • Expense20240119001 – Financial Expenses: 82,862.75  \n  • Expense20240119001 – Sales Expenses: 21,035.98  \n  • Expense20240120001 – Administrative Expenses: 96,278.36  \n  • Expense20240121001 – Administrative Expenses: 50,605.14  \n  • Expense20240121001 – Administrative Expenses: 89,152.38  \n  • Expense20240122001 – Sales Expenses: 66,953.91  \n  • Expense20240123001 – Financial Expenses: 76,771.42  \n  • Expense20240124001 – Administrative Expenses: 28,942.11  \n  • Expense20240125001 – Financial Expenses: 92,558.72  \n  • Expense20240125001 – Administrative Expenses: 54,062.11  \n  • Expense20240126001 – Sales Expenses: 66,053.33  \n  • Expense20240127001 – Administrative Expenses: 48,958.22  \n  • Expense20240127001 – Sales Expenses: 25,010.75  \n  • Expense20240128001 – Administrative Expenses: 40,022.82  \n  • Expense20240128001 – Sales Expenses: 66,279.02  \n  • Expense20240129001 – Financial Expenses: 42,174.02  \n  • Expense20240129001 – Administrative Expenses: 64,541.96  \n  • Expense20240130001 – Sales Expenses: 99,857.40  \n  • Expense20240131001 – Sales Expenses: 99,981.12  \n  • Expense20240201001 – Sales Expenses: 57,315.43  \n  • Depreciation20240201002 – Depreciation: 74,884.67  \n  • Expense20240202001 – Sales Expenses: 69,500.88  \n  • Expense20240202001 – Sales Expenses: 56,421.46  \n  • Expense20240203001 – Financial Expenses: 49,152.30  \n  • Expense20240203001 – Administrative Expenses: 18,035.41  \n  • Expense20240204001 – Sales Expenses: 39,992.76  \n  • Expense20240205001 – Administrative Expenses: 14,646.48  \n  • Expense20240205001 – Administrative Expenses: 98,343.86\n\n3. Now sum these amounts. (One way to “check” is to add them sequentially.)\n\nBy summing the listed numbers step by step one obtains a grand total of approximately 3,407,096.31.\n\nThe final “Total Expenses” item that would appear on the income statement is thus 3,407,096.31.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Expenses\": \"3407096.31\"}}",
