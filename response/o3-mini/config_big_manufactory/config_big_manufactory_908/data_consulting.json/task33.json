                        "content": "We first need to extract and compute the key amounts from the provided statements. Note that “total current liabilities” (our “debt”) come from the Balance Sheet and “net cash flow from operating activities” appears in the Cash Flow statement. In addition, the Inventory Turnover Ratio uses the Cost of Goods Sold from the Income Statement and the average inventory (using the beginning value and ending value from the Balance Sheet).\n\nStep 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio and Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \n• Operating Cash Flow Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Current Liabilities)  \n• Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is computed the same way here (using total current liabilities as debt).\n\nFrom the Cash Flow statement:  \n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –16,772,398.72  \nFrom the Balance Sheet:  \n  Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89  \n\nThus:  \n  Ratio = –16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ –5.337 ≈ –5.34  \n\nStep 2. Inventory Turnover Ratio  \nThis ratio is usually computed as:  \n  Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  \n\nFrom the Income Statement:  \n  Cost of Goods Sold = 16,400,000.00  \nFrom the Balance Sheet, Inventory:  \n  Beginning Inventory = 0.00  \n  Ending Inventory = 6,600,000.00  \nSo, Average Inventory = (0.00 + 6,600,000.00) / 2 = 3,300,000.00  \n\nThus:  \n  Ratio = 16,400,000.00 / 3,300,000.00 ≈ 4.9697 ≈ 4.97  \n\nStep 3. Debt to Equity Ratio  \nThis is given by:  \n  Debt to Equity = (Total Liabilities) / (Total Owner’s Equity)\n\nHere, Total Liabilities (only current liabilities appear) = 3,143,833.89  \n  Total Owner’s Equity = 29,938,987.47  \n\nThus:  \n  Ratio = 3,143,833.89 / 29,938,987.47 ≈ 0.105 ≈ 0.11  \n\nStep 4. Quick Ratio  \nCalculated as:  \n  Quick Ratio = (Total Current Assets – Inventory) / (Total Current Liabilities)\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:  \n  Total Current Assets = 22,474,420.77  \n  Inventory = 6,600,000.00  \n\nThus:  \n  Numerator = 22,474,420.77 – 6,600,000.00 = 15,874,420.77  \n  Ratio = 15,874,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 5.049 ≈ 5.05  \n\nStep 5. Current Ratio  \nIt is computed as:  \n  Current Ratio = (Total Current Assets) / (Total Current Liabilities)\n\nThus:  \n  Ratio = 22,474,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 7. fifteen (7.15)\n\nFinally, we put our results into the required JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-5.34\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-5.34\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"4.97\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"5.05\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"7.15\"\n  }\n}",
