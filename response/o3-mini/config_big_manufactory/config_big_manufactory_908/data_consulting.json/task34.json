                        "content": "We first extract the end‐of‐period numbers from the provided statements. Then we use the following formulas:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Current Liabilities)\n\n  = –16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ –5.34\n\n2. Debt to Equity Ratio = (Total Liabilities) / (Total Owner’s Equity)\n\n  Here Total Liabilities can be computed as Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity – Owner’s Equity:\n  = (33,082,821.36 – 29,938,987.47) / 29,938,987.47 = 3,143,833.89 / 29,938,987.47 ≈ 0.11\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio = (Total Revenue) / (Total Assets)\n\n  = 22,876,677.56 / 33,082,821.36 ≈ 0.69\n\n4. Quick Ratio = (Current Assets – Inventory) / (Total Current Liabilities)\n\n  = (22,474,420.77 – 6,600,000.00) / 3,143,833.89 \n  = 15,874,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 5.05\n\n5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Current Liabilities)\n\n  This is the same as (1), so –5.34\n\n6. Return on Equity (ROE) = (Net Profit) / (Total Owner’s Equity)\n\n  = 1,938,987.47 / 29,938,987.47 ≈ 0.0648, or about 6.48%\n\n7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = (Total Revenue) / (Average Accounts Receivable)\n\n  Assuming the beginning accounts receivable is zero, the average is (0 + Ending Accounts Receivable)/2 = 15,362,611.64/2 = 7,681,305.82\n  Thus, the ratio = 22,876,677.56 / 7,681,305.82 ≈ 2.98\n\nBelow is the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-5.34\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.69\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"5.05\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-5.34\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"6.48%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.98\"\n  }\n}",
