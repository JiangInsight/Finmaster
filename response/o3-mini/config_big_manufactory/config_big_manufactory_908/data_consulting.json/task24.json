Calculate Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n• From the balance sheet the “Total Liabilities” are given by “Total Current Liabilities” which is  \n  3143833.89  \n• The “Total Assets” (end amount) is  \n  33082821.36  \n• The Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated as:  \n  Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets  \n  = 3143833.89 / 33082821.36  \n  ≈ 0.0951  \nRounded to two decimal places, this ratio is 0.10.\n\nStep 2. Calculate “Net Cash Ratio”\n\n(Note: The sample problem’s second ratio was computed as the Operating Cash Flow to Net Profit Ratio. In our case we follow that same method.)\n\n• From the cash flow statement, the “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities” is  \n  -16772398.72  \n• From the income statement, the “Net Profit” is  \n  1938987.47  \n• The ratio is computed as:  \n  Net Cash Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Net Profit  \n  = (-16772398.72) / 1938987.47  \n  ≈ -8.65\n\nThus, our two computed ratios are:\n\n• Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.10  \n• Net Cash Ratio: -8.65\n\nWe now present the answer in the required json format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.10\",\n    \"Net Cash Ratio\": \"-8.65\"\n  }\n}",
