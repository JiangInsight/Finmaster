                        "content": "We start by extracting and computing the required items from the provided financial statements.\n\n1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nFrom the balance sheet, the Total Owner’s Equity at end‑date is 29,938,987.47 and the Total Liabilities can be determined as the difference between the Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity and the Owner’s Equity. That is:\n\n  Total Liabilities = Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity – Total Owner’s Equity  \n    = 33,082,821.36 – 29,938,987.47  \n    ≈ 3,143,833.89\n\nThen,\n  Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities ÷ Total Owner’s Equity  \n    ≈ 3,143,833.89 ÷ 29,938,987.47  \n    ≈ 0.105 (rounded to two decimals, this is 0.11)\n\n2. Net Profit Margin\n\nNet Profit Margin is defined as\n  (Net Profit ÷ Total Revenue) × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement, Net Profit = 1,938,987.47 and Total Revenue (or Main Business Revenue) = 22,876,677.56. Thus:\n\n  Net Profit Margin = (1,938,987.47 ÷ 22,876,677.56) × 100%  \n    ≈ 0.08474 × 100%  \n    ≈ 8.47%\n\n3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n\nROA is computed by:\n  (Net Profit ÷ Total Assets) × 100%\n\nThe Total Assets at end‑date are 33,082,821.36. Hence,\n\n  ROA = (1,938,987.47 ÷ 33,082,821.36) × 100%  \n    ≈ 0.0586 × 100%  \n    ≈ 5.86%\n\n4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\nThis ratio is usually calculated as Sales (or Main Business Revenue) divided by the average Accounts Receivable. Here, there is no beginning Accounts Receivable on the balance sheet (it is 0.00); the end amount is 15,362,611.64 so the average equals:\n\n  Average Accounts Receivable = (0.00 + 15,362,611.64) ÷ 2  \n    ≈ 7,681,305.82\n\nThus, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio becomes:\n  = Main Business Revenue ÷ Average Accounts Receivable  \n  = 22,876,677.56 ÷ 7,681,305.82  \n  ≈ 2.98\n\nNow we present the final answers in the requested format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"8.47%\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"5.86%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.98\"\n  }\n}",
