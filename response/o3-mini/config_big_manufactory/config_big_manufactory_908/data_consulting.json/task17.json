In the example, the debt was represented by Total Current Liabilities. We do the same here.\n\nStep 1. From the cash flow statement:\n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –16,772,398.72\n\nStep 2. From the balance sheet at the end date:\n  Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n\nStep 3. Compute the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio using:\n  Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Current Liabilities)\n\nThus:\n  Ratio = –16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ –5.34\n\nPresenting the result in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-5.34\"}\n}",
