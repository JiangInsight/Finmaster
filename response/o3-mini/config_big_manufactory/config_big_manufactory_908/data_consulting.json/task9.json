Find Cash and Cash Equivalents:\n• From the balance sheet, the “Cash on Hand” ending amount is 627601.28 and the “Bank Deposits” ending amount is –129032.26.\n• Their sum is: 627601.28 + (–129032.26) = 498569.02.  \n• This value matches the “Ending Balance” from the “Cash and Cash Equivalents” section in the cash flow statement.\n\nStep 2. Find Current Liabilities:\n• The balance sheet reports “Total Current Liabilities” at 3143833.89.\n\nStep 3. Calculate the Ratio:\n• Cash to Current Debt Ratio = Cash and Cash Equivalents / Total Current Liabilities  \n• = 498569.02 / 3143833.89 ≈ 0.1585, which rounds to approximately 0.16.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"0.16\"}\n}",
