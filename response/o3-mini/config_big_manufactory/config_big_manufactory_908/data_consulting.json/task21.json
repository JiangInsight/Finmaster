                        "content": "We first calculate the Free Cash Flow (FCF) by subtracting the capital expenditure (the “Purchase of Fixed Assets”) from the operating cash flow. In the cash flow statement the “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities” is –16,772,398.72 and the “Purchase of Fixed Assets” is 2,729,032.26. Thus:\n\n  FCF = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) – (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n    = –16,772,398.72 – 2,729,032.26 \n    = –19,501,430.98\n\nNext, the Current Assets Turnover Ratio is computed as Total Revenue divided by the ending Total Current Assets. The income statement shows a Total Revenue of 22,876,677.56 and the balance sheet “Total Current Assets” at the end is 22,474,420.77. Therefore:\n\n  Current Assets Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / End Total Current Assets \n    ≈ 22,876,677.56 / 22,474,420.77 \n    ≈ 1.0179, which rounds to 1.02\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-19501430.98\",\n    \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"1.02\"\n  }\n}",
