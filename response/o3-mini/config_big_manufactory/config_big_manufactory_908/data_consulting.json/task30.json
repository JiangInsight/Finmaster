                        "content": "We start by extracting the key figures (all values are taken as the End_amount from the balance sheet):\n\n1. Current Assets = 22,474,420.77  \n   Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89  \n\n• Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \n  = 22,474,420.77 / 3,143,833.89  \n  ≈ 7.15\n\n2. Inventory = 6,600,000.00  \n For the Quick Ratio, we subtract Inventory from Current Assets:  \n  Quick Assets = Current Assets – Inventory  \n    = 22,474,420.77 – 6,600,000.00  \n    = 15,874,420.77  \n• Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities  \n  = 15,874,420.77 / 3,143,833.89  \n  ≈ 5.05\n\n3. Total Assets = 33,082,821.36  \n   Note: In this case, the only liabilities provided are the current liabilities.\n• Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets  \n  = 3,143,833.89 / 33,082,821.36  \n  ≈ 0.095 (which we round to 0.10)\n\n4. Total Owner's Equity = 29,938,987.47  \n• Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity  \n  = 3,143,833.89 / 29,938,987.47  \n  ≈ 0.105 (or 0.11)\n\n5. From the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is –16,772,398.72.  \n We use current liabilities as the “debt” measure.  \n• Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Liabilities  \n  = –16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89  \n  ≈ –5.34\n\nThus, the final calculated figures are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"7.15\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"5.05\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.10\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-5.34\"\n  }\n}",
