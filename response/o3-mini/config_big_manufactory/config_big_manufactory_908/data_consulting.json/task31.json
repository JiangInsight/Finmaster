                        "content": "We start by extracting the required figures from the provided statements.\n\n1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n• Sales (from the income statement – Main Business Revenue) = 22,876,677.56  \n• Accounts Receivable at the end is 15,362,611.64 (beginning is 0).  \n• Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 15,362,611.64) / 2 = 7,681,305.82  \n• Ratio = 22,876,677.56 / 7,681,305.82 ≈ 2.98  \n\n2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio AND Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \nThe cash flow statement shows:  \n• Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –16,772,398.72  \n• Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89 (from balance sheet)  \n• Ratio = –16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ –5.34  \n(Note: Here both ratios are computed the same way.)  \n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n• Sales = 22,876,677.56  \n• Total Assets: Beginning = 28,000,000.00 and End = 33,082,821.36  \n• Average Total Assets = (28,000,000.00 + 33,082,821.36) / 2 = 30,541,410.68  \n• Ratio = 22,876,677.56 / 30,541,410.68 ≈ 0.75  \n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n• Total Liabilities are calculated from the balance sheet as:  \n  Total Liabilities = Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity – Total Owner's Equity  \n  = 33,082,821.36 – 29,938,987.47 = 3,143,833.89  \n• Total Owner’s Equity (end) = 29,938,987.47  \n• Ratio = 3,143,833.89 / 29,938,987.47 ≈ 0.105, which rounds to 0.11  \n\nThus, the final answers are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.98\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-5.34\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-5.34\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.75\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\"\n  }\n}",
