In this case, the only liabilities are current liabilities:\n  Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 2,000,000.00 + 1,143,833.89 = 3,143,833.89.\n• Total Owner’s Equity (at end date) is given as 29,938,987.47.\n• Debt to Equity Ratio = 3,143,833.89 / 29,938,987.47 ≈ 0.105 → Rounded to 0.11.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Net Profit Margin.\n• Net Profit is given as 1,938,987.47.\n• Total Revenue is given as 22,876,677.56.\n• Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100\n  = (1,938,987.47 / 22,876,677.56) × 100 ≈ 8.47%.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n• Operating Cash Flow is given as Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –16,772,398.72.\n• Current Liabilities total = 3,143,833.89.\n• Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities = –16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ –5.335 → Rounded to –5.34.\n\nThus, the final answers are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"8.47%\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-5.34\"\n  }\n}",
