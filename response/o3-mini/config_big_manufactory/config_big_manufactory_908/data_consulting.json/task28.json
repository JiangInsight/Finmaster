Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio.\n• From the balance sheet, Total Liabilities is given as \"Total Current Liabilities\": 3,143,833.89.\n• Total Assets at period end are 33,082,821.36.\n• Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets = 3,143,833.89 / 33,082,821.36 ≈ 0.0951.\n• Rounded to two decimals, we get 0.10.\n\nStep 2. Calculate the Gross Profit Margin.\n• From the income statement, Gross Profit = 6,476,677.56 and Total Revenue = 22,876,677.56.\n• Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100% = (6,476,677.56 / 22,876,677.56) × 100% ≈ 28.33%.\n\nStep 3. Calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n• From the cash flow statement, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –16,772,398.72.\n• Using the same Total Current Liabilities of 3,143,833.89 (from the balance sheet) :\n• Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Operating CF / Total Current Liabilities = –16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ –5.337.\n• Rounded to two decimals, the ratio is approximately –5.34.\n\nFinally, the answer is provided in the required json format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.10\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"28.33%\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-5.34\"\n  }\n}",
