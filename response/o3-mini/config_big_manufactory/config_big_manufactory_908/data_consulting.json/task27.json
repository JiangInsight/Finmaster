                        "content": "We start by identifying and extracting the required key figures from the provided statements. In our case the three ratios will be computed as follows:\n\n1. Net Cash Ratio (a.k.a. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio):\n  = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Net Profit)\n  From the cash-flow statement:\n   Net CF (Operating) = –16,772,398.72 \n  and from the income statement:\n   Net Profit = 1,938,987.47\n  Thus,\n   Ratio = –16,772,398.72 / 1,938,987.47 ≈ –8.65\n\n  Note: In the example both numbers had the same sign and the ratio came out positive. Here the operating cash flow is negative while the net profit is positive, so the ratio is negative.\n\n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio:\n  = (Total Revenue) / (Total Current Assets)\n  From the income statement:\n   Total Revenue = 22,876,677.56\n  and from the balance sheet:\n   Total Current Assets = 22,474,420.77\n  Thus,\n   Ratio = 22,876,677.56 / 22,474,420.77 ≈ 1.02\n\n3. Quick Ratio:\n  = (Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable) / (Total Current Liabilities)\n  From the balance sheet:\n   Cash on Hand = 627,601.28\n   Bank Deposits = –129,032.26  (note: negative bank deposits indicate an overdraft)\n   Interest Receivable = 13,240.11\n   Accounts Receivable = 15,362,611.64\n  The sum of these (quick assets) is:\n   Quick Assets = 627,601.28 + (–129,032.26) + 13,240.11 + 15,362,611.64 \n                  = 15,874,420.77\n  and Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89.\n  Thus,\n   Quick Ratio = 15,874,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 5.05\n\nPresenting the final answers in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Ratio\": \"-8.65\",\n    \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"1.02\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"5.05\"\n  }\n}",
