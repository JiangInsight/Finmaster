                        "content": "We first note that the sample problem calculated a ratio by comparing the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities (which is the cash flow from operating activities) with the Net Profit. In the sample, the ratio was calculated as follows:\n\n  Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities ÷ Net Profit  \n  = (–7,259,994.10) ÷ (–1,645,141.43) ≈ 4.41\n\nFor the current problem, we use the same method. The values provided are:\n\n  Net Profit = 1,938,987.47  \n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –16,772,398.72\n\nThus, the ratio is computed as:\n\n  Net Cash Ratio = –16,772,398.72 ÷ 1,938,987.47  \n  ≈ –8.65\n\nSo, the answer is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Net Cash Ratio\": \"-8.65\"}\n}",
