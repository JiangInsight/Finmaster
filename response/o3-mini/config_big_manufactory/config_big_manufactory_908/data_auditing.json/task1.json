In doing so we found two rows where one or more fields conflict with (or are clearly in error when compared to) the standardized information provided by the invoice text. In one case a transaction whose type was recorded as “Sale” has an invoice that clearly indicates an Interest Receivables entry. In the other case the invoice–amount field for an Interest Receivables transaction is negative. Our best‐guess corrections are that the “Interest20240113013” should have been recorded as “Interest Receivables” rather than “Sale” and that the negative figure in “Interest20240205036” (–11.48) should be corrected to be a positive 11.48. \n\nBelow we provide our answer using the requested JSON format. \n\n----------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": [\n  {\n    \"Original category\": \"Interest Receivables\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Original date\": null,\n    \"Recorded date\": null,\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Original payment_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n    \"Original quantity\": null,\n    \"Recorded quantity\": null,\n    \"Original price\": null,\n    \"Recorded price\": null,\n    \"Original receive_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": null,\n    \"Original amount\": null,\n    \"Recorded amount\": null,\n    \"Original tax\": null,\n    \"Recorded tax\": null,\n    \"Original profit\": null,\n    \"Recorded profit\": null,\n    \"Original Preparer\": null,\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n    \"Original Approver\": null,\n    \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n    \"id\": \"Interest20240113013\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Original category\": null,\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Interest Receivables\",\n    \"Original date\": null,\n    \"Recorded date\": null,\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Original payment_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n    \"Original quantity\": null,\n    \"Recorded quantity\": null,\n    \"Original price\": null,\n    \"Recorded price\": null,\n    \"Original receive_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": null,\n    \"Original amount\": \"11.48\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"-11.48\",\n    \"Original tax\": null,\n    \"Recorded tax\": null,\n    \"Original profit\": null,\n    \"Recorded profit\": null,\n    \"Original Preparer\": null,\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n    \"Original Approver\": null,\n    \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n    \"id\": \"Interest20240205036\"\n  }\n]}\n",
