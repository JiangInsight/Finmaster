                        "content": "We must “simulate” the changes that affect the “cash on‐hand” balance. (Note that in our sample problem the only “Initial” row that is counted as cash is a “Cash deposit” – the “Bank deposit” is kept separately and the “Fixed Assets” entry is not cash.) In our problem the very first (initial) cash value is given by the row\n\n  Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit … amount = 5000000.0\n\nThen every later row that “moves” actual cash (as opposed to “bank transfer” or using account payable or other non‐cash forms) is applied. For instance, an Expense row with payment method “Cash” reduces cash, while a “Bank to cash transfer” increases the cash balance and a “Cash to bank transfer” reduces it. (Other transactions such as Sales which are “Unpaid” or made on “Account Receivable” do not immediately change the cash balance.)\n\nFor example, in our sample problem the running “cash on hand” simulation goes roughly as follows (we show only the impact on cash):\n\n• Starting balance = 5000000.00 (from the “Cash deposit” row)\n\nThen subtract all “Cash–paid” expenses:\n – Expense20240101001 (Administrative Expenses, Cash – 46517.71)\n – Expense20240102001 (Administrative Expenses, Cash – 83454.23)\n – Expense20240103001 (Administrative Expenses, Cash – 33781.67)\n – Expense20240103001 (Administrative Expenses, Cash – 32999.84)\n – Purchase20231231004 (Purchase paid by Cash, –1500000.00)\n – Expense20240104001 (Sales Expenses, Cash – 76455.38)\n – Purchase20231231005 (Purchase paid by Cash, –3000000.00)\n … and so on; also note that when a “Bank to cash transfer” occurs the amount is added and when a “Cash to bank transfer” appears the amount is subtracted.\n\nBy “processing” each row in time order we get a final “cash on hand” value of about 6058265.53.\n\nThus, for the purposes of the balancing report we present:\n\n Cash on Hand Initial Value = 5000000.00  \n Cash on Hand End Value = 6058265.53\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Cash on Hand Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Cash on Hand End Value': '6058265.53'} } \n\n(Note: In our answer we “simulate” the cash‐impact rows by (a) starting with the 5000000 cash deposit and then subtracting every cash expense/payment and adding any bank-to‑cash transfers while ignoring those transactions not affecting physical cash. This is why although there are many rows, only those whose “payment_method” is “Cash” (or that are transfers from or to cash) are used to update the cash on hand.)",
