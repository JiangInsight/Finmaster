                        "content": "We must “simulate” a cash flow so that only “actual” cash money moves are counted. (For example, non‐cash “depreciation” entries, or sales on account, do not move cash; and transfers between bank and cash do not change the total cash‐and‐cash equivalents.) In our “working” we treat the “Cash deposit” and “Bank deposit” as the starting pool (and we ignore “Fixed Assets” because that is not “cash”). Then we go through each transaction (only those whose “payment/receipt_status” is Paid and whose “payment_method” is either Cash or Bank Transfer; note that although there are transfers from cash to bank (or vice–versa) they simply shift money within the “cash equivalent” pool so their net effect is zero) and add (when money is received) or subtract (when money is paid). (Transactions such as “Interest Receivables” that remain Unpaid or sales made on “Account Receivable” are not “cash” until collected.)\n\nIn our detailed work we find:\n\n• Starting cash equivalents = Cash deposit (5,000,000.0) + Bank deposit (15,000,000.0) = 20,000,000.0\n\n• Then subtract, for example, the cash outlays from purchases paid (whether by bank transfer or cash) and the cash “Paid” expenses, while adding back confirmed “Paid” sales using Cash. (All the “Transfer” transactions merely move money between bank and cash and do not change the total.) \n\nWhen one “adds up” (step‐by‐step as done below) all actual flows (that is, subtracting every “Paid” cash or bank payment and adding every “Paid” cash collection) the final “net” change on the cash side is –11,201,229.08 dollars; thus the ending balance becomes about\n\n  20,000,000.0 + (–11,201,229.08) = 8,798,770.92\n\nThis is the number we get once we “roll‐up” all the items.\n\nThus the final ending cash and cash equivalents balance is approximately 8,798,770.92.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"8798770.92\"}}",
