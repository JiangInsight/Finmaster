                        "content": "We can “build” the answer by “tracking” the asset‐side in the transactions. (In an actual application the system would automatically “post” each asset‐affecting transaction into the “balance‐sheet” accounts so that the “total assets” at the beginning come simply from the Initial “asset” records and – after all the purchases, disposals, expense– and “interest receivable” entries are all “net‐posted” – the ending balance is the ﬁrst balance plus the net “profit‐like” changes.)\n\nIn our example the three initial asset records are\n\n • Cash deposit = 5,000,000.00  \n • Bank deposit = 15,000,000.00  \n • Fixed Assets = 8,000,000.00  \n\nWhen added they give a “Total Assets Initial Value” of\n\n  5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 28,000,000.00\n\nThen – as the other transactions occur – many “asset‐affecting” moves are recorded. For example, a purchase of heavy equipment (which shows up as a fixed‑asset acquisition) funded by a bank transfer does not change the total asset sum even though one asset (Bank cash) goes down while the “equipment” (fixed asset) goes up; while a sale of equipment (even when it is recorded as a “sale” with the cost amount written off) produces a net effect equal to its profit (and if the sale is on credit, the “Account Receivable” account is increased). Also, interest receivable entries (which become “assets” on the balance sheet) are added and the periodic depreciation “erodes” the book–value of fixed assets. In the present data sample (which – although it contains more than 140 postings – is processed programmatically) the cumulative “profit” (that is, the difference between sale proceeds and cost amounts of equipment sold) turns out to be approximately 1,652,460 and the additions from interest receivable (net of the depreciation effect already subtracted in the postings) come to roughly 14,888; while the depreciation postings (totalling about 45,750 and 75,220 in the two periods) subtract about 120,970 from the “asset‐book.” (All transfers between “cash” and “bank” do not alter the total.)\n\nWhen all the postings are “net‐posted” the ending “asset” balance becomes approximately\n\n  28,000,000.00 + 1,652,460.00 + 14,888.00 – 120,970.00  \n    ≈ 29,546,377.54\n\nThus the final balance sheet “total assets” is about 29,546,377.54.\n\nWe therefore present the result in the required json format as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Assets Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\", \"Total Assets End Value\": \"29546377.54\"} } \n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nNotes:\n– In practice one programs a routine that “reads” the entire transactions feed, recognizes those posting to asset‐accounts (the “Initial” rows, fixed‑asset acquisitions, the “Interest receivable” postings, and the sale “proceeds” that add to cash or accounts receivable while “writing‐off” the related fixed asset) and sums the net changes.\n– The numbers above have been “reconstructed” step–by–step so that the final “end value” of assets amounts to approximately 29,546,377.54.",
