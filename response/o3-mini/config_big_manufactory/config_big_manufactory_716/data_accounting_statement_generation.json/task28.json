                        "content": "We need to “pick out” all the transactions that record a “Sales Expenses” (that is, only those rows whose type is exactly \"Sales Expenses\") and then add (sum) their amounts. (Note that in an income‐statement you list “selling expenses” – here we treat our “Sales Expenses” rows as the only items under that heading.)\n\nStep 1. Identify the “Sales Expenses” rows. In the given table these rows are:\n\n• Row 18 – Expense20240104001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 76,455.38  \n• Row 23 – Expense20240105001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 19,956.10  \n• Row 26 – Expense20240106001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 66,794.44  \n• Row 39 – Expense20240109001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 70,987.96  \n• Row 46 – Expense20240111001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 51,086.01  \n• Row 54 – Expense20240113001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 41,117.40  \n• Row 55 – Expense20240113001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 68,725.40  \n• Row 61 – Expense20240115001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 34,107.04  \n• Row 65 – Expense20240116001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 99,827.65  \n• Row 72 – Expense20240118001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 16,630.45  \n• Row 80 – Expense20240120001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 35,294.97  \n• Row 87 – Expense20240121001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 69,032.68  \n• Row 98 – Expense20240124001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 28,346.48  \n• Row 101 – Expense20240125001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 41,705.41  \n• Row 103 – Expense20240126001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 69,296.99  \n• Row 108 – Expense20240127001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 57,454.13  \n• Row 113 – Expense20240129001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 60,968.71  \n• Row 122 – Expense20240131001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 18,674.79  \n• Row 130 – Expense20240202001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 98,116.24  \n• Row 134 – Expense20240203001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 86,216.74  \n• Row 135 – Expense20240203001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 46,127.65  \n• Row 141 – Expense20240205001 – Sales Expenses – amount = 20,182.64  \n\nStep 2. Sum these amounts. For clarity, let’s add them in groups:\n\nGroup 1 (rows 18, 23, 26, 39, 46):  \n 76,455.38 + 19,956.10 = 96,411.48  \n 96,411.48 + 66,794.44 = 163,205.92  \n 163,205.92 + 70,987.96 = 234,193.88  \n 234,193.88 + 51,086.01 = 285,279.89  \n\nGroup 2 (rows 54, 55, 61, 65):  \n 41,117.40 + 68,725.40 = 109,842.80  \n 109,842.80 + 34,107.04 = 143,949.84  \n 143,949.84 + 99,827.65 = 243,777.49  \n\nGroup 3 (rows 72, 80, 87, 98):  \n 16,630.45 + 35,294.97 = 51,925.42  \n 51,925.42 + 69,032.68 = 120,958.10 (approximately)  \n 120,958.10 + 28,346.48 = 149,304.58 (the small rounding differences do not change the final result much)  \n\nGroup 4 (rows 101, 103, 108, 113):  \n 41,705.41 + 69,296.99 = 111,002.40  \n 111,002.40 + 57,454.13 = 168,456.53  \n 168,456.53 + 60,968.71 = 229,425.24  \n\nGroup 5 (rows 122, 130, 134, 135, 141):  \n 18,674.79 + 98,116.24 = 116,791.03  \n 116,791.03 + 86,216.74 = 203,007.77  \n 203,007.77 + 46,127.65 = 249,135.42  \n 249,135.42 + 20,182.64 = 269,318.06  \n\nNow, adding all groups:  \n Group 1 + Group 2 = 285,279.89 + 243,777.49 = 529,057.38  \n 529,057.38 + Group 3 (≈149,304.58) = 678,361.96  \n 678,361.96 + Group 4 (229,425.24) = 907,787.20  \n 907,787.20 + Group 5 (269,318.06) = 1,177,105.26 (≈1,177,105.26)\n\nA more careful grouping gives a final total of about 1,177,105.26.\n\nStep 3. Format your answer.\nWe present the result as the final \"Selling Expenses\" in the income statement.\n\nThus the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Selling Expenses\": \"1177105.26\"\n  }\n}\n\n(Using two‐decimal rounding you may also write \"1177105.26\".)\n\nBelow is our answer in the requested JSON format. \n\nFinal Answer:\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Selling Expenses\": \"1177105.26\"}}",
