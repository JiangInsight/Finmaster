                        "content": "We must “re‐build” the balance‐sheet fixed asset amount by starting with the “initial fixed assets” (from your “Initial” row) and then “adjusting” for any later “fixed asset purchase” and “depreciation” transactions. (Other purchases for supplies or inventory even if they are heavy and expensive are not part of the “fixed assets” account if they are not recorded in the fixed assets category.) \n\nStep‑by‑step reasoning:\n\n1. Look at the “initial” rows. There is an initial record of type “Fixed Assets” on 2023‑12‑31 with an amount of 8,000,000.0. This is the starting (or “initial”) fixed asset value.\n\n2. Next, add any acquisitions of fixed assets. In these transactions the “type” is “Fixed Assets Purchase”. In our data there is one such row:\n  • id = FixedAsset20231231001 “Fixed Assets Purchase” on 2023‑12‑31 with an amount of 758,493.61\nThus the fixed assets “gross” before depreciation become:\n  8,000,000.00 + 758,493.61 = 8,758,493.61\n\n3. Finally, subtract any depreciation recorded. In our postings there are two depreciation entries:\n  • Depreciation20240101001: amount = 45,749.96 (on 2024‑01‑01)\n  • Depreciation20240201002: amount = 75,220.20 (on 2024‑02‑01)\nThe total depreciation is:\n  45,749.96 + 75,220.20 = 120,970.16\n\n4. Hence, the “end” (or net book value) of fixed assets is:\n  8,758,493.61 – 120,970.16 = 8,637,523.45\n\n5. Rounding these to two decimals, we express them as:\n  Initial value: 8,000,000.00\n  End value (net book value): 8,637,523.45\n\nThus the answer to the task is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"8637523.45\"\n  }\n}",
