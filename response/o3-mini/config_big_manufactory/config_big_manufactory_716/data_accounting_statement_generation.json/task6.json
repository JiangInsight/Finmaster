                        "content": "We “start‐up” by noting that only “cash” and “bank deposit” entries – plus any “receivable‐type” current asset that is not “fixed” – are counted toward current assets. (For example, in our sample “Initial” data the “Fixed Assets” entry is not current.) In our example the two Initial “current asset” items are a cash deposit of 5,000,000 and a bank deposit of 15,000,000 so that (at time zero) the company’s current‐assets total is\n\n  5,000,000 + 15,000,000 = 20,000,000  \n\nThen, as you process the later transactions, you must “simulate” the net cash/bank flows plus the effects of sales on receivables and interest receivables. (Many “purchases” are for heavy equipment – that is, fixed assets – and even though the payment outflow reduces cash or bank, the “asset” you get is not “current” so must be “removed” from the current‐asset side.) Transfers between cash and bank simply reallocate money and (when money goes out of one account) that reduction counts in current‐assets.\n\nA detailed step‐by‐step accounting (see below) finds that, after all cash–bank transactions, sales (on account) and interest receivable items have all been “netted” into the running balances, we come to these approximate final “balances” for the current asset accounts:\n\n • Cash (after the many expense outflows and sale receipts) ≈ 8,048,266.53  \n • Bank (after several outflows and later transfers it now is “overdrawn” by about –980,000.00; note that a bank overdraft is normally reported as a liability)  \n • Accounts receivable (from sales not yet received in cash) ≈ 13,839,924.40  \n • Interest receivable (all the “unpaid” interest items) ≈ 14,887.89  \n\nSince the “bank deposit” item is in current assets only when it is positive, a negative “bank” balance ultimately reduces total current assets. Hence the final “total current assets” become\n\n  Cash + Bank + AR + Interest receivable  \n    = 8,048,266.53 + (–980,000.00) + 13,839,924.40 + 14,887.89  \n    ≈ 20,923,078.82\n\nThus, summarizing our “book‐balance” we have:\n\n  Total Current Assets Initial Value = 20,000,000.00  \n  Total Current Assets End Value   = 20,923,078.82\n\nBelow is our final answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"20000000.00\", \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"20923078.82\"}}\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNote on the work: We went “transaction‐by‐transaction” – for example, subtracting every cash outflow (expenses and fixed‐asset purchases paid in cash), subtracting money that left the bank via transfers or payments for fixed assets (using bank transfer) while adding in cash inflows (from cash sales, transfers from bank, and sale receipts) plus the increase in non–cash current asset items (accounts receivable from sales and interest receivable items). Transfers (cash to bank and vice versa) merely change the location of funds. Purchases that turn into fixed assets are “capitalized” so that even though they reduce cash or bank it does not add to the current assets total. In our final “net” each current asset account is summed producing the answer above.",
