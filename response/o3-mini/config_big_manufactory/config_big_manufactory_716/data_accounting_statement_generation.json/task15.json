                        "content": "We start by “declaring” that in the opening (“Initial…”) rows the company did not record any liability amount. (The three “Initial” entries are asset‐type opening balances only.) Then we scan through the subsequent transactions and “flag” those purchase transactions that have not been paid (that is, with a status of “Unpaid” and/or with a payment method denoted as “Account Payable”). In our table the only purchase entries with status “Unpaid” (that is, creating a liability) are:\n\n• Row with id Purchase20231231002 (a purchase for Heavy Equipment C) – amount 1,000,000.0  \n• Row with id Purchase20231231008 (a purchase for Heavy Equipment A) – amount 1,000,000.0  \n• Row with id Purchase20231231012 (a purchase for Heavy Equipment B) – amount 1,600,000.0  \n• Row with id Purchase20231231018 (a purchase for Heavy Equipment D) – amount 3,000,000.0  \n\n(Other purchase transactions have status “Paid” – meaning they have been settled immediately and so do not “show up” as a liability.)\n\nWe then sum the amounts on the “unpaid” purchases:\n  1,000,000.0 + 1,000,000.0 = 2,000,000.0  \n  2,000,000.0 + 1,600,000.0 = 3,600,000.0  \n  3,600,000.0 + 3,000,000.0 = 6,600,000.0\n\nThus the “final” (end‐of‐period) total liabilities amount is 6,600,000.00 while the initial liabilities balance (since none of the “Initial…” rows gave a liability) is 0.00.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"6600000.00\"} }\n--------------------------------------------------",
