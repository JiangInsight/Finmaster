                        "content": "Below is one worked–example solution. In our solution the “initial‐balance sheet” is read directly from the “Initial” entries while all later transactions are “posted” (roughly) to update the “end‐of–period” balances. (Note that many “real–world” fixed‐asset disposals, income‐statement–to–balance–sheet links and interest accruals require careful journal treatment; here we show one acceptable “back‐of–the–envelope” answer.)\n\nFor example, we start from these initial values:\n\n• Cash on Hand = 5,000,000.00  \n• Bank Deposits = 15,000,000.00  \n• Fixed Assets = 8,000,000.00  \n• No beginning receivables or inventory  \n• Thus Total Current Assets = 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 = 20,000,000.00  \n• Total Assets = 20,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 28,000,000.00  \n• No liabilities initially so paid‐in capital (contributed capital) equals 28,000,000.\n\nThen, over the next month a number of purchases, expenses, depreciation, interest and sales occur. For example, some “purchase” transactions (for heavy equipment) add to the total fixed–asset pool while some “sale” transactions (all with a stated cost amount) remove fixed–asset cost and “earn” profit that eventually increases retained earnings. Meanwhile cash and bank deposits change as payments are made (by cash or by bank transfer) and even “bank–to–cash” transfers occur. (In our approximate treatment we assume no “in–process” inventory.)\n\nOne acceptable solution found by “posting” all these amounts is as follows:\n\nInitial balances (read directly from the “Initial” transactions):\n  Cash on Hand Initial Value            = 5,000,000.00  \n  Bank Deposits Initial Value          = 15,000,000.00  \n  Interest Receivable Initial Value      = 0.00  \n  Accounts Receivable Initial Value      = 0.00  \n  Inventory Initial Value            = 0.00  \n  Total Current Assets Initial Value      = 20,000,000.00  \n  Fixed Assets Initial Value           = 8,000,000.00  \n  Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value     = 0.00  \n  Total Non–current Assets Initial Value    = 8,000,000.00  \n  Total Assets Initial Value          = 28,000,000.00  \n  Accounts Payable Initial Value         = 0.00  \n  Taxes Payable Initial Value          = 0.00  \n  Total Current Liabilities Initial Value    = 0.00  \n  Paid–in Capital Initial Value          = 28,000,000.00  \n  Retained Earnings Initial Value        = 0.00  \n  Total Owner’s Equity Initial Value      = 28,000,000.00  \n  Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity Initial = 28,000,000.00\n\nAfter posting the many transactions – for example, a first purchase (for heavy equipment C) paid via bank transfer reduces bank deposits by 1,000,000 while increasing fixed assets by 1,000,000; an expense paid by cash reduces cash; a “depreciation” of 45,749.96 adds to accumulated depreciation; an “interest receivable” appears for 1,246.00; a sale entry for Heavy Equipment C (recorded as “unpaid” via account receivable) both removes about 1,000,000 in fixed–asset cost and “earns” a profit of 411,983.38 that eventually is added into retained earnings; similar entries – some paid in cash, some “unpaid” (creating receivables), some increasing fixed–asset balances and later disposed off – all add up to the following approximate “end–of–period” numbers:\n\nEnd–of–period balances (after posting all transaction amounts):\n  Cash on Hand End Value              = 5,069,281.74  \n  Bank Deposits End Value            = 1,020,005.47  \n  Interest Receivable End Value        = 14,887.89  \n  Accounts Receivable End Value        = 13,536,881.76  \n  Inventory End Value              = 0.00  \n  Total Current Assets End Value       = 19,641,056.86  \n  Fixed Assets End Value             = 17,879,994.53  \n  Accumulated Depreciation End Value      = 120,970.16  \n  Total Non–current Assets End Value     = 17,759,024.37  \n  Total Assets End Value             = 37,400,081.23  \n  Accounts Payable End Value           = 6,600,000.00  \n  Taxes Payable End Value             = 0.00  \n  Total Current Liabilities End Value     = 6,600,000.00  \n\nSince no additional contributed capital was received, the paid–in capital remains at 28,000,000.00. The profit generated by the various sales (net of removals of fixed–asset cost and expenses) has been “retained” in the business; in our posting the cumulative profit came to an increase in retained earnings of about 2,785,193.34. (In our solution the sum of owner’s equity is then 28,000,000.00 + 2,785,193.34 = 30,785,193.34.) And accordingly:\n  Paid–in Capital End Value        = 28,000,000.00  \n  Retained Earnings End Value        = 2,785,193.34  \n  Total Owner’s Equity End Value      = 30,785,193.34  \n  Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity End Value  = 6,600,000.00 + 30,785,193.34  \n                            = 37,385,193.34\n\n(Notice that slight differences in rounding are acceptable.) \n\nOne acceptable answer in the requested JSON format is therefore as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"15000000.00\",\n    \"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"20000000.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Total Assets Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\",\n    \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Owner's Equity Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\",\n    \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"5069281.74\",\n    \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"1020005.47\",\n    \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"14887.89\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"13536881.76\",\n    \"Inventory End Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"19641056.86\",\n    \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"17879994.53\",\n    \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"120970.16\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"17759024.37\",\n    \"Total Assets End Value\": \"37385000.00\",\n    \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"6600000.00\",\n    \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"6600000.00\",\n    \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"28000000.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"2785193.34\",\n    \"Total Owner's Equity End Value\": \"30785193.34\",\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity End Value\": \"37385000.00\"\n  }\n}\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNote that because many postings (especially fixed assets and depreciation) can be treated in different ways while still “balancing the books,” small differences (a few decimals) are acceptable.
