                        "content": "We must “build” the accounts payable balance by “adding” all new purchase items that have not been paid (i.e. that use the liability “Account Payable” as payment method and/or show “Unpaid” in their status) while payments on purchases (that were already paid) do not remain outstanding. In our data the only items that increase accounts payable are the purchase transactions whose “payment/receipt_status” is “Unpaid” and which were processed via Account Payable. Reviewing the rows:\n\n• Row with id Purchase20231231002 shows an Unpaid purchase for 1,000,000.0  \n• Row with id Purchase20231231008 shows an Unpaid purchase for 1,000,000.0  \n• Row with id Purchase20231231012 shows an Unpaid purchase for 1,600,000.0  \n• Row with id Purchase20231231018 shows an Unpaid purchase for 3,000,000.0  \n\nNone of the other purchase transactions increase the accounts payable balance because they were already “Paid” (or settled by a bank or cash transfer).\n\nThus, the net increase in Accounts Payable equals: \n\n  1,000,000.0 + 1,000,000.0 + 1,600,000.0 + 3,000,000.0 = 6,600,000.0\n\nSince no other adjustments (like payments against outstanding purchases) are recorded here, the final accounts payable figure is an increase of 6,600,000.00.\n\nAccordingly, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"6600000.00\"\n  }\n}",
