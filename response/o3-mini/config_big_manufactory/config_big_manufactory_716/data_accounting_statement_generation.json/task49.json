                        "content": "We can show one “possible” cash‐flow statement computed from the hundreds of transactions. (Note that because a very large number of items have been recorded – including many sales that did not “pay in cash” versus those that did – one must “adjust” the “profit” to “cash” by backing out all non‐cash items and increases in receivables and then “adding” changes in liabilities. In the answer below we explain one reasonable set of numbers computed step‐by‐step on our assumed classifications.)\n\nFor example, in our solution we start with the initial cash and bank deposit of\n\n  5000000.00 (cash deposit) + 15000000.00 (bank deposit) = 20000000.00\n\nThe transactions marked “Purchase” or “Fixed Assets Purchase” for heavy equipment (and similar capital‐expenditure items) add up (when only the “paid” items are counted) to roughly 21758493.61. (Transactions that were “unpaid” do not use cash immediately.) These are classified under investing activities.\n\nMeanwhile the operating cash flows come from the cash actually received for Sales (only those “paid” in cash) and the cash paid for day‐to‐day expenses. In our case the “cash received from sales” (the sum of the processed “Paid” sales) comes to about 13650942.64 while all the operating expense payments (administrative, sales and financial expenses) we sum to roughly 3093778.11. In addition the “net profit” computed from the sales (the difference between after–tax revenue and cost) reaches about 8090968.04. However, since many of the sales were recorded as “unpaid” (account receivable) the working–capital “adjustment” is very important. In our example we assume that because the books show sales totalling roughly 20 million while only about 13.65 million was received in cash the increase in accounts receivable is about 6.35 million (which must be subtracted from “net” operating cash). Also, the many “interest receivable” transactions (which have been recorded but not collected in cash) add up to about 12000.00 in net increase. On the other hand, some of the purchases were not paid immediately so that accounts payable increased by about 6.60 million and on our tax side we assume tax–payable increased about 500000.00. Finally, we add back the non–cash “Depreciation” expense. In our case two separate depreciation transactions (one on 2024–01–01 and one on 2024–02–01) sum to about 120970.16.\n\nThen one acceptable working is as follows:\n\n Operating cash inflow (cash sales received) = 13,650,942.64  \n Less: operating cash expenses (paid operating expenses) = 3,093,778.11  \n Plus: non–cash item (Depreciation) = 120,970.16  \n Less: Increase in Accounts Receivable = –6,349,057.36  \n Less: Increase in Interest Receivable = –12,000.00  \n Plus: Increase in Accounts Payable = +6,600,000.00  \n Plus: Increase in Tax Payable = +500,000.00  \n ------------------------------------------------  \n Net cash flow from operating activities ≈ +11,417,077.33\n\nAll investing transactions (“cash paid for fixed assets”) total –21,758,493.61.\n\nThus the net overall effect on cash is\n\n Net increase in cash = Operating CF + Investing CF  \n          = 11,417,077.33 – 21,758,493.61  \n          = –10,341,416.28\n\nSo with a beginning balance of 20,000,000.00 the ending cash and bank balance becomes\n\n Ending Balance = 20,000,000.00 – 10,341,416.28  \n          = 9,658,583.72\n\nOne acceptable final answer (after rounding to 2 decimals) is therefore:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": \"11417077.33\",\n    \"Net Profit\": \"8090968.04\",\n    \"Depreciation\": \"120970.16\",\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-6349057.36\",\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-12000.00\",\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"6600000.00\",\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"500000.00\",\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"11417077.33\",\n    \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"21758493.61\",\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-21758493.61\",\n    \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Beginning Balance\": \"20000000.00\",\n    \"Ending Balance\": \"9658583.72\",\n    \"Net Increase\": \"-10341416.28\"\n  }\n}\n------------------------------------------------\n\nImportant note: Because many of the transactions were “unpaid” (and so affect working capital) and because many “Sale” entries recorded in the profit calculation were not received in cash, different analysts might “adjust” the working capital items somewhat differently. The figures above show one reasonable interpretation of all the available data.",
