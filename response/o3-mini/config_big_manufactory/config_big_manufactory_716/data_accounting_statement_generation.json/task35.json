All “Sale”‐type transactions were summed to yield a total “Main Business Revenue” of 28,562,608.70 (and so “Total Revenue” was the same).\n2. All “cost_amount” fields on the sale lines were summed (20,200,000.00) to yield the cost of goods sold and total cost.\n3. Gross profit was computed as Revenue minus COGS (8,362,608.70).\n4. Among the operating expenses the “Administrative Expenses” and “Sales Expenses” (here treated as “Selling Expenses”) were separately summed to 1,458,073.43 and 1,160,430.47 respectively. The “Depreciation” transactions added to 120,970.16 and the “Financial Expenses” totaled 302,433.42. Their overall sum gave Total Expenses of 3,041,907.48.\n5. All “Interest Receivables” records (non‐operating income) were summed – here 14,887.89.\n6. Profit before tax is Gross Profit minus Total Expenses plus Interest Income (5,335,589.11).\n7. Assuming an effective tax rate of 25% on profit before tax, Tax Expense was computed as 1,333,897.28, leaving a Net Profit of 4,001,691.83.\nEach number has been rounded to two decimals.\n",
