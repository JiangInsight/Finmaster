                        "content": "We need to “recover” from the list of transactions the net change in inventory so that we can see by how much (if any) our ending inventory is higher than our beginning inventory.\n\nIn our “problem to solve” the only transactions with a non‐empty product_id (and a cost_per_unit value) are the ones “brought in” as purchases and “removed” via sales. (Note that “Fixed Assets” and similar lines are not “inventory” in an operating sense.) In other words, we “build” an ending inventory balance for the operating items by summing the purchased units (each valued at its cost) then subtracting out the units that have been sold (using the cost that was “assigned” when purchased). One common approach is to compute the net quantity on hand for each product and then multiply by the purchase cost per unit (here the purchases for each product come at a consistent price).\n\nLet’s go step‐by‐step (using the simplified assumption that there was no beginning inventory):\n\n───────────────────────────────  \nStep 1. Identify purchase entries that “add” to inventory (only those with a product_id):\n\nFor each “Purchase” row we have (remember that all amounts are in monetary units, and the “quantity” column tells how many units were purchased):\n\n• For product P003 (Heavy Equipment C):\n – Purchase20231231001: quantity = 1 (unit price 1,000,000)\n – Purchase20231231002: quantity = 1 \n – Purchase20231231003: quantity = 1 \n – Purchase20231231016: quantity = 2 (unit price 1,000,000)\n  Total purchased P003 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5 units  \n  Value = 5 × 1,000,000 = 5,000,000\n\n• For product P004 (Heavy Equipment D):\n – Purchase20231231004: quantity = 1 (unit price 1,500,000)\n – Purchase20231231005: quantity = 2 (unit price 1,500,000)\n – Purchase20231231010: quantity = 1 \n – Purchase20231231014: quantity = 1 \n – Purchase20231231015: quantity = 2 \n – Purchase20231231017: quantity = 1 \n – Purchase20231231018: quantity = 2 \n  Total purchased P004 = 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 10 units  \n  Value = 10 × 1,500,000 = 15,000,000\n\n• For product P002 (Heavy Equipment B):\n – Purchase20231231006: quantity = 2 (unit price 800,000)\n – Purchase20231231007: quantity = 1 \n – Purchase20231231009: quantity = 2 \n – Purchase20231231012: quantity = 2 \n  Total purchased P002 = 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7 units  \n  Value = 7 × 800,000 = 5,600,000\n\n• For product P001 (Heavy Equipment A):\n – Purchase20231231008: quantity = 2 (unit price 500,000)\n – Purchase20231231011: quantity = 1 \n – Purchase20231231013: quantity = 1 \n  Total purchased P001 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 units  \n  Value = 4 × 500,000 = 2,000,000\n\n───────────────────────────────  \nStep 2. Identify “Sale” entries that remove inventory:\n\nOnly the “Sale” rows which have a product_id (with a “cost_amount” given) affect inventory. (We assume the “cost_amount” is the cost assigned to the sold unit.) Let’s list the units sold by product:\n\n• P003 (Heavy Equipment C):\n – Sale20240103001: quantity = 1  (cost_amount 1,000,000)\n – Sale20240124024: quantity = 1  (cost_amount 1,000,000)\n – Sale20240127028: quantity = 1  (cost_amount 1,000,000)\n – Sale20240204039: quantity = 1  (cost_amount 1,000,000)  \n  Total sold P003 = 1+1+1+1 = 4 units\n\n• P004 (Heavy Equipment D):\n – Sale20240107006: quantity = 1  (cost_amount 1,500,000)\n – Sale20240113011: quantity = 1  (cost_amount 1,500,000)\n – Sale20240119019: quantity = 1  (cost_amount 1,500,000)\n – Sale20240121022: quantity = 1  (cost_amount 1,500,000)\n – Sale20240128030: quantity = 1  (cost_amount 1,500,000)\n – Sale20240130032: quantity = 1  (cost_amount 1,500,000)\n – Sale20240201034: quantity = 1  (cost_amount 1,500,000)\n – Sale20240203036: quantity = 1  (cost_amount 1,500,000)  \n  Total sold P004 = 8 units\n\n• P002 (Heavy Equipment B):\n – Sale20240106004: quantity = 1  (cost_amount 800,000)\n – Sale20240110009: quantity = 1  (cost_amount 800,000)\n – Sale20240118017: quantity = 1  (cost_amount 800,000)  \n  Total sold P002 = 3 units\n\n• P001 (Heavy Equipment A):\n – Sale20240117016: quantity = 1  (cost_amount 500,000)\n – Sale20240120020: quantity = 1  (cost_amount 500,000)  \n  Total sold P001 = 2 units\n\n───────────────────────────────  \nStep 3. Compute ending inventory per product\n\nFor a given product:\n Ending units = Purchased quantity – Sold quantity\n\n• P003: 5 – 4 = 1 unit  = 1 × 1,000,000 = 1,000,000  \n• P004: 10 – 8 = 2 units  = 2 × 1,500,000 = 3,000,000  \n• P002: 7 – 3 = 4 units  = 4 × 800,000 = 3,200,000  \n• P001: 4 – 2 = 2 units  = 2 × 500,000 = 1,000,000  \n\nNow, the total ending inventory value = 1,000,000 + 3,000,000 + 3,200,000 + 1,000,000 = 8,200,000\n\n───────────────────────────────  \nStep 4. Establish the “(Increase) Decrease in Inventory” for the cash flow statement\n\nBecause no “initial inventory” was given (we assume a zero beginning inventory) the entire ending inventory shows as an increase. In a cash flow statement a rise in inventory is a use of cash and is normally shown with a negative sign. (It “decreases” cash even though the asset balance is higher.)\n\nThus, the change is an increase of 8,200,000, and when entered into the cash flow statement it is reported as –8,200,000.00\n\n───────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answer in the Requested JSON Format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-8200000.00\"\n  }\n}",
