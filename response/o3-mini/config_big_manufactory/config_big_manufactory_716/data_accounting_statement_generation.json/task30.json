(Note that we do not include beginning cash/bank/fixed asset “Initial” rows, purchases, transfers, interest receivables, sales, or other non–expense transactions.)\n\nBelow is our step‐by‐step procedure:\n\n1. Identify every row in the table whose “type” starts with “Expense” (such as “Administrative Expenses”, “Sales Expenses”, “Financial Expenses”) or is “Depreciation.” (Other types like Purchase, Sale, Transfer, Interest Receivables, Fixed Assets etc. are not expense items for computing the “total expenses” on the income statement.)\n\n2. Extract the “amount” field for each such row. In our input table the following rows (with their amount values) qualify:\n\n • Expense20240101001 (Administrative Expenses):     46,517.71  \n • Depreciation20240101001 (Depreciation):             45,749.96  \n • Expense20240102001 (Administrative Expenses):     83,454.23  \n • Expense20240103001 (Administrative Expenses):     33,781.67  \n • Expense20240103001 (Administrative Expenses):     32,999.84  \n • Expense20240104001 (Sales Expenses):               76,455.38  \n • Expense20240105001 (Sales Expenses):               19,956.10  \n • Expense20240106001 (Sales Expenses):               66,794.44  \n • Expense20240107001 (Administrative Expenses):      88,987.43  \n • Expense20240107001 (Administrative Expenses):      41,863.27  \n • Expense20240108001 (Administrative Expenses):      10,564.48  \n • Expense20240108001 (Administrative Expenses):      76,852.11  \n • Expense20240109001 (Administrative Expenses):     79,898.85  \n • Expense20240109001 (Sales Expenses):               70,987.96  \n • Expense20240110001 (Administrative Expenses):      33,141.79  \n • Expense20240110001 (Financial Expenses):           60,049.63  \n • Expense20240111001 (Sales Expenses):               51,086.01  \n • Expense20240111001 (Financial Expenses):           52,391.74  \n • Expense20240112001 (Administrative Expenses):      90,795.92  \n • Expense20240112001 (Financial Expenses):           69,569.70  \n • Expense20240113001 (Sales Expenses):               41,117.40  \n • Expense20240113001 (Sales Expenses):               68,725.40  \n • Expense20240114001 (Administrative Expenses):      19,703.65  \n • Expense20240115001 (Sales Expenses):               34,107.04  \n • Expense20240115001 (Administrative Expenses):      79,293.14  \n • Expense20240116001 (Administrative Expenses):      89,732.07  \n • Expense20240116001 (Sales Expenses):               99,827.65  \n • Expense20240117001 (Administrative Expenses):      39,891.05  \n • Expense20240118001 (Sales Expenses):               16,630.45  \n • Expense20240119001 (Administrative Expenses):      72,945.61  \n • Expense20240119001 (Administrative Expenses):      67,136.76  \n • Expense20240120001 (Sales Expenses):               35,294.97  \n • Expense20240120001 (Administrative Expenses):      87,087.28  \n • Expense20240121001 (Sales Expenses):               69,032.68  \n • Expense20240122001 (Administrative Expenses):      23,299.79  \n • Expense20240123001 (Administrative Expenses):      78,951.08  \n • Expense20240123001 (Administrative Expenses):      39,097.33  \n • Expense20240124001 (Sales Expenses):               28,346.48  \n • Expense20240125001 (Sales Expenses):               41,705.41  \n • Expense20240126001 (Sales Expenses):               69,296.99  \n • Expense20240126001 (Financial Expenses):           36,380.83  \n • Expense20240127001 (Sales Expenses):               57,454.13  \n • Expense20240128001 (Administrative Expenses):      79,524.95  \n • Expense20240129001 (Sales Expenses):               60,968.71  \n • Expense20240129001 (Administrative Expenses):      10,275.59  \n • Expense20240130001 (Administrative Expenses):      25,487.02  \n • Expense20240130001 (Financial Expenses):           66,912.09  \n • Expense20240131001 (Sales Expenses):               18,674.79  \n • Expense20240131001 (Administrative Expenses):      63,593.73  \n • Expense20240201001 (Administrative Expenses):      82,900.73  \n • Depreciation20240201002 (Depreciation):             75,220.20  \n • Expense20240202001 (Sales Expenses):               98,116.24  \n • Expense20240202001 (Administrative Expenses):      66,892.65  \n • Expense20240203001 (Sales Expenses):               86,216.74  \n • Expense20240203001 (Sales Expenses):               46,127.65  \n • Expense20240204001 (Financial Expenses):           52,734.73  \n • Expense20240204001 (Financial Expenses):           33,964.40  \n • Expense20240205001 (Sales Expenses):               20,182.64\n\n3.
