(Note that the “Initial” transactions do not include any accounts payable.) \n\nLooking at the data, only purchase transactions with “payment_method” marked as “Account Payable” (and with an “Unpaid” status) will affect the liability “Accounts Payable.” In the table below these are the only rows that matter:\n\n1. Transaction with id “Purchase20231231002”  \n  • Amount = 1,000,000.00  \n  • Payment method “Account Payable” and status “Unpaid.”\n\n2. Transaction with id “Purchase20231231008”  \n  • Amount = 1,000,000.00  \n  • Payment method “Account Payable” (Unpaid).\n\n3. Transaction with id “Purchase20231231012”  \n  • Amount = 1,600,000.00  \n  • Payment method “Account Payable” (Unpaid).\n\n4. Transaction with id “Purchase20231231018”  \n  • Amount = 3,000,000.00  \n  • Payment method “Account Payable” (Unpaid).\n\nNone of the “Initial” transactions mention accounts payable (they are only for cash deposit, bank deposit, fixed assets, etc.) so the beginning balance for Accounts Payable is zero.\n\nNow add up the amounts of the “Account Payable” purchases:  \n  1,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 = 2,000,000.00  \n  2,000,000.00 + 1,600,000.00 = 3,600,000.00  \n  3,600,000.00 + 3,000,000.00 = 6,600,000.00\n\nThus, the initial Accounts Payable balance is 0.00 and the ending balance (after processing all transactions) is 6,600,000.00.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"6600000.00\"} }",
