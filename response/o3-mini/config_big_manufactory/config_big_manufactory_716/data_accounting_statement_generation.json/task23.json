In our table the sales records list their cost_amount. Our first step is to identify all the sales rows and then sum their cost_amount values.\n\nLet’s list the sale transactions and the corresponding cost_amount values:\n\n1. Sale20240103001 – cost_amount = 1,000,000.0  \n2. Sale20240106004 – cost_amount = 800,000.0  \n3. Sale20240107006 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n4. Sale20240109007 – cost_amount = 800,000.0  \n5. Sale20240110009 – cost_amount = 800,000.0  \n6. Sale20240113011 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n7. Sale20240117016 – cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n8. Sale20240118017 – cost_amount = 800,000.0  \n9. Sale20240119019 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n10. Sale20240120020 – cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n11. Sale20240121022 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n12. Sale20240124024 – cost_amount = 1,000,000.0  \n13. Sale20240127028 – cost_amount = 1,000,000.0  \n14. Sale20240128030 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n15. Sale20240130032 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n16. Sale20240201034 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n17. Sale20240203036 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n18. Sale20240204039 – cost_amount = 1,000,000.0  \n\nNow we add these amounts step‑by‑step:\n\n• 1,000,000  \n+   800,000 = 1,800,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 3,300,000  \n+   800,000 = 4,100,000  \n+   800,000 = 4,900,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 6,400,000  \n+   500,000 = 6,900,000  \n+   800,000 = 7,700,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 9,200,000  \n+   500,000 = 9,700,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 11,200,000  \n+ 1,000,000 = 12,200,000  \n+ 1,000,000 = 13,200,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 14,700,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 16,200,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 17,700,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 19,200,000  \n+ 1,000,000 = 20,200,000  \n\nThus, the final Cost of Goods Sold is 20,200,000.00.\n\nWe now present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n  \n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"20200000.00\"} }\n```",
