                        "content": "We must “close‐the books” by “netting” all operating revenue and expense items. In our simplified treatment we assume that any opening retained earnings is zero and that only those transactions that hit the income‐statement (not purchases or balance transfers) change our “retained earnings.”\n\nIn our file the rows that affect profit (and so retained earnings) are of type “Sale”, “Expense”, “Depreciation” and “Interest Receivables” (which—for our purposes—are “interest income”). (Note that purchases, fixed asset “Initial” entries and inter‐account “Transfer” rows change balance–sheet asset/liability accounts but do not affect the profit shown on the income statement.)\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n\n1. For each “Sale” row we use the “profit” field (which is computed as after–tax revenue less the cost amount) and add all such profit values.\n  • In our file the sale rows (by id) and example profits are:\n   – Sale20240103001: profit ≈ 411983.38 \n   – Sale20240106004: profit ≈ 380660.04 \n   – Sale20240107006: profit ≈ 683357.44 \n   – Sale20240109007: profit ≈ 281640.66 \n   – Sale20240110009: profit ≈ 264438.17 \n   – Sale20240113011: profit ≈ 697737.08 \n   – Sale20240117016: profit ≈ 220191.63 \n   – Sale20240118017: profit ≈ 306030.68 \n   – Sale20240119019: profit ≈ 568407.48 \n   – Sale20240120020: profit ≈ 221719.53 \n   – Sale20240121022: profit ≈ 670939.20 \n   – Sale20240124024: profit ≈ 455453.32 \n   – Sale20240127028: profit ≈ 384684.30 \n   – Sale20240128030: profit ≈ 696931.90 \n   – Sale20240130032: profit ≈ 601413.12 \n   – Sale20240201034: profit ≈ 620132.85 \n   – Sale20240203036: profit ≈ 474918.04 \n   – Sale20240204039: profit ≈ 431969.88 \n  When we add them all (carefully using a step‐by‐step sum) we obtain roughly 8,372,609.\n\n2. Then we add all “Interest Receivables” amounts (all positive amounts in our file) which total roughly 14,888.\n\n3. We also subtract all “Expense” items. (Here “Expense” rows come in several flavors: Administrative, Sales, Financial – plus “Depreciation” is also an expense.) Adding together all the administrative expenses (all the “Expense… Administrative Expenses” rows) gives roughly 1,457,869; all the Sales expenses sum to about 946,831; all the Financial expenses sum to about 304,091; and the two Depreciation rows add to about 120,970. In total the “expense side” is about 2,829,762.\n\n4. The net profit then is\n\n  Net income ≈ (Sale profits + Interest income) – Expenses  \n    ≈ (8,372,609 + 14,888) – 2,829,762  \n    ≈ 8,387,497 – 2,829,762  \n    ≈ 5,557,735\n\nSince we assume the retained earnings “book‐balance” started at 0.00, the “ending” retained earnings is just the net income.\n\nThus the answer is:\n\nRetained Earnings Initial Value: 0.00  \nRetained Earnings End Value: approximately 5,557,735.00\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"5557735.00\"} }\n``` \n\n(Note: All values are approximate to two–decimal accuracy.)",
