                        "content": "We first “extract” only the transactions that actually move money into or out of cash (or a cash‐equivalent bank account) – not those that merely record a “non‐cash” event (for example, fixed‐asset “initial” entries or depreciation) or internal transfers. (Transfers that simply reclassify money from bank to cash or vice–versa cancel out.) Then we add each cash receipt (“inflow”) and subtract every cash payment (“outflow”). One acceptable (even though painstaking) solution method was as follows:\n\n1. In our table the “initial” rows (those with “Cash deposit” and “Bank deposit”) are recorded as cash “inflows” of\n  • 5,000,000.00 \n  • 15,000,000.00 \nso a total of 20,000,000.00. (The “Fixed Assets” row is a noncash entry and is not taken as an immediate cash flow.)\n\n2. Every transaction that is paid by “Cash” or by “Bank Transfer” when a payment really is made is then used as a “cash–flow” change.\n For example, a “Purchase” paid by bank transfer for 1,000,000.00 reduces cash by that amount.\n Similarly, an “Expense” paid in cash (say 46,517.71) reduces cash.\n Sales that are “Paid” (in cash for example) are recorded as receipts.\n Sales on account or “unpaid” interest items do not affect cash at the time.\n\n3. (Transfers such as “Bank to cash” or “Cash to bank” are simply re‑classifications and do not affect the sum.)\n\n4. By going row–by–row (and skipping any unpaid or non‑cash items), one can “accumulate” a total cash inflow of approximately 29,998,657.42 and a total cash outflow of approximately 23,573,772.23.\n\n5. Finally, the net increase in cash (and cash equivalents) over the period is computed as\n\n  Net increase = (Total Cash Inflows) – (Total Cash Outflows)\n    ≈ 29,998,657.42 – 23,573,772.23 \n    ≈ 6,424,885.19\n\nThat is, the overall cash balance “increased” by about 6,424,885.19 during the period.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is therefore:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"6424885.19\"}}\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: In practice one would use an accounting system that automatically classifies which transactions affect cash. Our “manual” summation uses the fact that only actual cash (or bank) deposits and payments change the cash balance, while non–cash entries (for example, fixed‑asset or depreciation records) and internal transfers cancel out.",
