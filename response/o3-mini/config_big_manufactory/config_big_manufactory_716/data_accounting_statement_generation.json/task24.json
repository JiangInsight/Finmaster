                        "content": "We can “build” the cost‐side of the income statement by “adding up” the cost‐of–sales (that is, the cost of items that have been sold) plus all the operating cost expenses (the “Expense” and “Depreciation” rows) – while not “counting” items that deal with financing (Interest), initial deposits and transfers or “capital” transactions (Fixed Assets, Fixed Assets Purchase).\n\nIn our “transaction table” the two groups that “run” into the “expense” side of the income statement are:\n\n1. The “Sale …” rows in which a “cost_amount” is given. For example, the first sale (row “Sale20240103001”) shows that although the sale brings in over 1.4 million, the “cost_amount” recorded for that sold‐item is 1,000,000. (Each sale row “already” shows its cost of goods sold.)\n\n2. The various “Expense …” (and “Depreciation …”) rows that record operating costs (for Administrative, Sales, Financial and Depreciation). (Items such as Interest Receivables, Transfers, and Initial/Fixed Assets are not “costs” in the income statement.)\n\nA careful (step–by–step) reading of the table shows the following totals:\n\nA. – For the “Sale” rows, we add up all the cost_amount values:\n  • Row “Sale20240103001”: 1,000,000.00 \n  • “Sale20240106004”:   800,000.00 \n  • “Sale20240107006”:  1,500,000.00 \n  • “Sale20240109007”:   800,000.00 \n  • “Sale20240110009”:   800,000.00 \n  • “Sale20240113011”:  1,500,000.00 \n  • “Sale20240117016”:   500,000.00 \n  • “Sale20240118017”:   800,000.00 \n  • “Sale20240119019”:  1,500,000.00 \n  • “Sale20240120020”:   500,000.00 \n  • “Sale20240121022”:  1,500,000.00 \n  • “Sale20240124024”:  1,000,000.00 \n  • “Sale20240127028”:  1,000,000.00 \n  • “Sale20240128030”:  1,500,000.00 \n  • “Sale20240130032”:  1,500,000.00 \n  • “Sale20240201034”:  1,500,000.00 \n  • “Sale20240203036”:  1,500,000.00 \n  • “Sale20240204039”:  1,000,000.00 \n\nWhen we sum these we get:\n\n  1,000,000 + 800,000 = 1,800,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 3,300,000  \n  + 800,000 = 4,100,000  \n  + 800,000 = 4,900,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 6,400,000  \n  + 500,000 = 6,900,000  \n  + 800,000 = 7,700,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 9,200,000  \n  + 500,000 = 9,700,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 11,200,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 12,200,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 13,200,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 14,700,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 16,200,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 17,700,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 19,200,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 20,200,000\n\nThat “COGS” (cost‐of–goods sold) total is 20,200,000.\n\nB. – Next we add the “operating expense” pieces. (We include every “Expense …” row as well as each “Depreciation …” row while not “adding” items like Transfers, Interest or the Initial/Fixed Assets rows.)

Transactions not part of operating results (e.g. initial deposits, transfers, fixed assets and interest receivables) are not included.\n\nTherefore the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Cost\": \"23338528.07\"\n  }\n}",
