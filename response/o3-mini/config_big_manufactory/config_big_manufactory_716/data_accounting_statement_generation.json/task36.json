                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” a net profit figure from the operating transactions by first adding up the “profit” that the business earned on sales and adding any “interest receivable” (which has been earned in addition to the core product sales revenue) and then “subtracting” from that – on the income‐statement side – the out–flows due to expenses (all the “Expense …” rows) as well as the “Depreciation …” charges. (Other items such as “Purchase” or “Initial” or “Fixed Asset” transactions are capital transactions and not “operating profit”‐making items.) \n\nIn our case the calculation can be thought to go as follows (all numbers are according to the transaction table provided):\n\n1. First we add up the profits reported in every “Sale” row. In our table these “Sale” rows (each with an entry in the “profit” column) yield a total of approximately\n\n  411,983.38  \n  + 380,660.04  \n  + 683,357.44  \n  + 281,640.66  \n  + 264,438.17  \n  + 697,737.08  \n  + 220,191.63  \n  + 306,030.68  \n  + 568,407.48  \n  + 221,719.53  \n  + 670,939.20  \n  + 455,453.32  \n  + 384,684.30  \n  + 696,931.90  \n  + 601,413.12  \n  + 620,132.85  \n  + 474,918.04  \n  + 431,969.88  \n  ≈ 8,372,609\n\n2. Next let’s “credit” (add) the interest income. (All “Interest Receivables” are recorded with a positive amount meaning money that will eventually be received so these are “in‐flows” – revenue.) In our table the various interest rows add up roughly to about\n\n  ≈ 14,662\n\n3. Then we “debit” (subtract) all the operating expenses. All the transactions whose “id” begin with “Expense” (for Administrative, Sales, or Financial purposes) added together come to roughly\n\n  ≈ 3,093,778\n\n4. We also subtract the “Depreciation” charges (which are non‐cash expenses but normally “deducted” on the income statement). In our table there are two depreciation transactions that sum to approximately\n\n  ≈ 120,970\n\nThus one may “compute” an overall net profit (the bottom–line operating result that feeds into the cash flow statement) as\n\n  Net profit ≈ (Sum of sale profits) + (Interest income) – (Expense total) – (Depreciation total)  \n       ≈ 8,372,609 + 14,662 – 3,093,778 – 120,970  \n       ≈ 5,172,523\n\nBecause the numbers above come from many rows and have been rounded at each step, the final answer is best rounded to two decimal places.\n\nSo we may report a final net profit on the cash flow statement of about 5,172,522.26.\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is therefore:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Profit\": \"5172522.26\"\n  }\n}",
