                        "content": "We can “build‐up” the final balance in Liabilities & Owners’ Equity by starting with the “initial” balance and then “adding in” the non–cash‐flow “results” of business (the net operating result plus any items that increased “payables” – that is, unpaid purchases change the “liability” side, even though cash was not exchanged).\n\nIn our case the following reasoning was used:\n\n1. The three “Initial” records give the starting “balance‐sheet figure” (which in a simple “capital‐contribution” approach is taken as the start of Owners’ Equity plus any “liability” backing the business). Here the initial amounts are\n\n  • Cash deposit = 5,000,000.00  \n  • Bank deposit = 15,000,000.00  \n  • Fixed Assets = 8,000,000.00\n\nAdding these up we get an initial “balance”\n  5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 28,000,000.00\n\n2. Next, note that some transactions do not “change” the net worth (for example, when a paid purchase simply converts cash into an asset) but some do affect the “business surplus” and others “build a liability.”  \n  \n• Many “Sale” rows carry a “profit” field. (Their profit is the sale’s revenue minus its cost of goods sold–after including any tax, etc.) In our data the sale entries have the following profit amounts (all in one currency unit):\n\n  – Sale20240103001: 411,983.38  \n  – Sale20240106004: 380,660.04  \n  – Sale20240107006: 683,357.44  \n  – Sale20240109007: 281,640.66  \n  – Sale20240110009: 264,438.17  \n  – Sale20240113011: 697,737.08  \n  – Sale20240117016: 220,191.63  \n  – Sale20240118017: 306,030.68  \n  – Sale20240119019: 568,407.48  \n  – Sale20240120020: 221,719.53  \n  – Sale20240121022: 670,939.20  \n  – Sale20240124024: 455,453.32  \n  – Sale20240127028: 384,684.30  \n  – Sale20240128030: 696,931.90  \n  – Sale20240130032: 601,413.12  \n  – Sale20240201034: 620,132.85  \n  – Sale20240203036: 474,918.04  \n  – Sale20240204039: 431,969.88\n\nAdding these “profit” amounts gives a total increase (from “sales‐result”) of about 8,372,608.70.\n\n• At the same time the business “runs expenses” (for Administration, Sales, and Financial purposes as well as the “Depreciation” item) that have been recorded in many “Expense…” lines. (These items reduce the net profit.) Adding all those expense amounts yields a total cost near 3,137,573.00. (There were many individual entries from about 46 thousand up to nearly 190 thousand – when summed they amount to roughly 3.14 million.)  \n  \nThus the “net operating effect” on Owners’ Equity from running the business is\n\n  8,372,608.70 – 3,137,573.00 = 5,235,036.70  (approximately).\n\n• In addition, note that some “Purchase” transactions were not paid in cash. For example, look at the following “Purchase” records:\n  – Purchase20231231002: 1,000,000.00 (status “Unpaid”)  \n  – Purchase20231231008: 1,000,000.00 (status “Unpaid”)  \n  – Purchase20231231018: 3,000,000.00 (status “Unpaid”)\n\nTheir sum (1 + 1 + 3) is 5,000,000.00, and each such “unpaid” purchase shows up as an increase in liabilities.\n\n3. Finally, the ending “Liabilities and Owners’ Equity” balance is found by adding these “changes” (the operating surplus plus the extra liability items) to the initial balance:\n  \n  Initial Balance: 28,000,000.00  \n  Net operating “gain” (surplus): +5,235,036.70  \n  Increase in liabilities from unpaid purchases: +5,000,000.00  \n  ——————————————————————————————  \n  Ending Liabilities & Owners’ Equity ≈ 28,000,000.00 + 5,235,036.70 + 5,000,000.00  \n                    = 38,235,036.70\n\n(In our presentation we round to two decimals.)\n\nThus the answers are:\n\n– Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value: 28,000,000.00  \n– Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value: 38,235,036.70\n\nFollowing the format requested we provide:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\", \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"38235036.70\"} } \n\n(Notes: In an actual accounting treatment one would “post” each transaction to its proper GL account; here we have “tallied” the net effect from the profit‐items (sales profit minus operating expenses) and added the increase due to “unpaid” purchase entries.)",
