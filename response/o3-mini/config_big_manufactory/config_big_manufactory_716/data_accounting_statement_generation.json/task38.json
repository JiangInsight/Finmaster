                        "content": "We must “build up” the ending (working‑capital) balance in accounts receivable from the period’s activities. In our books only those “Sale” transactions whose receive_method is “Account Receviable” (plus any “Interest Receivables” entries) will “add” to accounts receivable. Then, since there is no starting accounts receivable balance (see the “Initial” rows – they show only cash, bank, fixed asset amounts), an increase in AR during the period means that at period‑end AR is positive and—as far as cash flow is concerned—that increase uses cash (and so appears as a “decrease” item in the operating activities section).\n\nStep‐by‐step we proceed as follows:\n\n1. (a) Identify “Sale” transactions for which the receive_method equals “Account Receviable” (and where the payment/receipt_status remains “Unpaid”) since if customers have already paid the receipt method would have been “Cash.”\n • Sale20240103001 – after‑tax amount = 1,341,384.21 \n • Sale20240106004 – 1,121,627.04 \n • Sale20240107006 – 2,074,189.57 \n • Sale20240109007 – 1,027,558.63 \n • Sale20240121022 – 2,062,392.24 \n • Sale20240127028 – 1,315,450.08 \n • Sale20240130032 – 1,996,342.46 \n • Sale20240203036 – 1,876,172.14 \n • Sale20240204039 – 1,360,371.39 \n\n Summing these:\n  1,341,384.21 + 1,121,627.04 = 2,463,011.25  \n  + 2,074,189.57 = 4,537,200.82  \n  + 1,027,558.63 = 5,564,759.45  \n  + 2,062,392.24 = 7,627,151.69  \n  + 1,315,450.08 = 8,942,601.77  \n  + 1,996,342.46 = 10,938,944.23  \n  + 1,876,172.14 = 12,815,116.37  \n  + 1,360,371.39 = 14,175,487.76  \n\n(b) Next, “Interest Receivables” also occur (each recorded with type “Interest Receivables” and with an “Unpaid” status) so we add their amounts. (There are many such rows – when we sum them all the total comes out to about 14,661.83.)\n\n2. Now the ending Accounts Receivable balance is simply the sum of the “credit sales” plus the “interest receivables” that have not yet been collected:\n  Ending AR = 14,175,487.76 + 14,661.83 ≈ 14,190,149.59\n\n3. Since there was no AR at the start of the period, the net change is an increase of 14,190,149.59. (And in a cash‐flow statement, an increase in accounts receivable is “shown” as a use of cash – that is, a negative number.)\n\nThus the “(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable” line item to be reported in the cash flow statement is –14,190,149.59.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-14190149.59\"\n  }\n}",
