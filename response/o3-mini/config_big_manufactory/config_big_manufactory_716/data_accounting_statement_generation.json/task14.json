                        "content": "We need to “build” the current liabilities figure by looking at those transactions that – when still outstanding – drive a balance on the liability side. In our case the only items that affect current liabilities are purchases that were not “paid” (and in our list they appear with a payment/receipt_status of “Unpaid” and a payment_method that indicates a credit account such as “Account Payable”). (Other items such as “Initial” deposits or “Fixed Assets” are not current liabilities; likewise “Expense” items are passed to the income statement and later to retained earnings. Also “Interest Receivables” are assets and not liabilities.) \n\nStep 1. Look at all the “Purchase” transactions that occurred on 2023‑12‑31 because our “Initial” and “End” balances come from our period‐end position. In our list the “Purchase” rows are:\n\n• Purchase20231231001 – this one is Paid (via Bank Transfer) so it is not a liability.\n• Purchase20231231002 – recorded on 2023‑12‑31, amount = 1,000,000.0, payment/receipt_status = “Unpaid” and the payment_method is “Account Payable”. This increases current liabilities.\n• Purchase20231231003 – Paid.\n• Purchase20231231004 – Paid.\n• Purchase20231231005 – Paid.\n• Purchase20231231007 – Paid.\n• Purchase20231231008 – recorded on 2023‑12‑31, amount = 1,000,000.0, “Unpaid” with payment_method “Account Payable”. Include this amount.\n• Purchase20231231009 – Paid.\n• Purchase20231231010 – Paid.\n• Purchase20231231011 – Paid.\n• Purchase20231231012 – recorded on 2023‑12‑31, amount = 1,600,000.0, “Unpaid” (with typical “Account Payable” treatment). Include.\n• Purchase20231231013 – Paid.\n• Purchase20231231014 – Paid.\n• Purchase20231231015 – Paid.\n• Purchase20231231016 – Paid.\n• Purchase20231231017 – Paid.\n• Purchase20231231018 – recorded on 2023‑12‑31, amount = 3,000,000.0, “Unpaid” (and with payment_method “Account Payable”). Include.\n\nStep 2. Sum the amounts for the “Unpaid” purchases:\n  = 1,000,000.0 (from Purchase20231231002)\n  + 1,000,000.0 (from Purchase20231231008)\n  + 1,600,000.0 (from Purchase20231231012)\n  + 3,000,000.0 (from Purchase20231231018)\n  = 6,600,000.0\n\nNote that none of these “Unpaid” entries were paid later so they remain on the balance sheet both as the opening (initial) trial‐balance on 2023‑12‑31 and at the “end” of the period.\n\nThus the “Total Current Liabilities Initial Value” is 6,600,000.00 and the “Total Current Liabilities End Value” remains 6,600,000.00.\n\nWe now present the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\nFinal answer:\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Liabilities Initial Value': '6600000.00', 'Total Current Liabilities End Value': '6600000.00'}}",
