                        "content": "We must “build” the current inventory (its “end‐of‐period” value) by “adding” all the purchases of goods (the “inventory‐items”) and then “subtracting” the cost amounts of the goods that were sold. (Note that our “initial” balance for inventory is not given – so it is taken to be zero.) \n\nBelow is a brief outline of our step–by–step reasoning:\n\n1. Looking at the “Purchase…” rows we pick out those that carry a non‐empty product (for example, “Heavy Equipment C”, “Heavy Equipment D”, “Heavy Equipment B” and “Heavy Equipment A”). (Note that the “Initial” rows are for cash, bank or fixed assets; they are not “inventory” items.) In our table there are many purchase rows. For each such row we take the “amount” (which is recorded as quantity×unit cost) and add them up. In our work we found that the sum of all “inventory purchases” is\n\n  1,000,000.0 (from Purchase20231231001)  \n+ 1,000,000.0 (Purchase20231231002)  \n+ 1,000,000.0 (Purchase20231231003)  \n+ 1,500,000.0 (Purchase20231231004)  \n+ 3,000,000.0 (Purchase20231231005)  \n+ 1,600,000.0 (Purchase20231231006)  \n+ 800,000.0  (Purchase20231231007)  \n+ 1,000,000.0 (Purchase20231231008)  \n+ 1,600,000.0 (Purchase20231231009)  \n+ 1,500,000.0 (Purchase20231231010)  \n+ 500,000.0  (Purchase20231231011)  \n+ 1,600,000.0 (Purchase20231231012)  \n+ 500,000.0  (Purchase20231231013)  \n+ 1,500,000.0 (Purchase20231231014)  \n+ 3,000,000.0 (Purchase20231231015)  \n+ 2,000,000.0 (Purchase20231231016)  \n+ 1,500,000.0 (Purchase20231231017)  \n+ 3,000,000.0 (Purchase20231231018)  \n  = 27,600,000.0 \n\n2. Next the “Sale…” rows that remove inventory were identified. (Again, we work only with those rows that have a product – the “Sale” rows show a “cost_amount” that tells us the cost of the inventory items sold.) Summing up their cost amounts we get:\n\n  1,000,000.0 (Sale20240103001)  \n+ 800,000.0  (Sale20240106004)  \n+ 1,500,000.0 (Sale20240107006)  \n+ 800,000.0  (Sale20240109007)  \n+ 800,000.0  (Sale20240110009)  \n+ 1,500,000.0 (Sale20240113011)  \n+ 500,000.0  (Sale20240117016)  \n+ 800,000.0  (Sale20240118017)  \n+ 1,500,000.0 (Sale20240119019)  \n+ 500,000.0  (Sale20240120020)  \n+ 1,500,000.0 (Sale20240121022)  \n+ 1,000,000.0 (Sale20240124024)  \n+ 1,000,000.0 (Sale20240127028)  \n+ 1,500,000.0 (Sale20240128030)  \n+ 1,500,000.0 (Sale20240130032)  \n+ 1,500,000.0 (Sale20240201034)  \n+ 1,500,000.0 (Sale20240203036)  \n+ 1,000,000.0 (Sale20240204039)  \n  = 20,200,000.0 \n\n3. (Since there is no “inventory” provided at the beginning of the period the “Inventory Initial Value” is assumed to be zero.)\n\n4. Finally, the ending inventory amount is computed as\n\n  Ending inventory = (Total purchases) – (Total cost of goods sold)  \n    = 27,600,000.0 – 20,200,000.0  \n    = 7,400,000.0\n\nThus the results to be shown on the balance‐sheet for inventory are an “Inventory Initial Value” of 0.00 and an “Inventory End Value” of 7400000.00.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Inventory End Value\": \"7400000.00\"}}",
