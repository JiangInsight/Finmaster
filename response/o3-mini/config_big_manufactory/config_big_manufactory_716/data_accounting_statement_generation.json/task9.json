In this case the opening balance is from the “Initial20231231001” row with type “Fixed Assets” and an amount of 8,000,000.0.\n\nNext we look for any transactions that add to the fixed asset base. In our data the only addition is the row whose type is “Fixed Assets Purchase” (the row with id FixedAsset20231231001) with an amount of 758,493.61. (Other “Purchase” rows may refer to operating purchases; only those clearly recorded on the fixed‐asset side—i.e. that record an asset name and asset type—are used here.)\n\nNow we must subtract depreciation. In our data there are two depreciation transactions:\n• Depreciation20240101001 with an amount of 45,749.96 \n• Depreciation20240201002 with an amount of 75,220.2 \nTheir total is 45,749.96 + 75,220.2 = 120,970.16.\n\nThus the net fixed assets at the end of the period are calculated as follows:\n  Net Fixed Assets = initial value + fixed asset additions – depreciation\n    = 8,000,000.00 + 758,493.61 – 120,970.16 \n    = 8,758,493.61 – 120,970.16 \n    = 8,637,523.45\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"fixed assets net Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"fixed assets net End Value\": \"8637523.45\"\n  }\n}",
