                        "content": "We can “derive” the tax‐payable balance for the period by “adding up” the tax amounts generated on sales (since no tax‐remittance or “input credits” appear on purchases). In our transactions the only nonzero “tax_amount” entries are on the sale rows. Thus, after going through all the sale transactions we can “sum” the tax amounts and interpret that as the net increase in the tax–payable account (with a zero opening balance).\n\nThe sale transactions (with their tax_amount values) are as follows:\n\n1. Sale20240103001: 70,599.17  \n2. Sale20240106004: 59,033.00  \n3. Sale20240107006: 109,167.87  \n4. Sale20240109007: 54,082.03  \n5. Sale20240110009: 53,221.91  \n6. Sale20240113011: 109,886.85  \n7. Sale20240117016: 36,009.58  \n8. Sale20240118017: 55,301.53  \n9. Sale20240119019: 103,420.37  \n10. Sale20240120020: 36,085.98  \n11. Sale20240121022: 108,546.96  \n12. Sale20240124024: 72,772.67  \n13. Sale20240127028: 69,234.22  \n14. Sale20240128030: 109,846.60  \n15. Sale20240130032: 105,070.66  \n16. Sale20240201034: 106,006.64  \n17. Sale20240203036: 98,745.90  \n18. Sale20240204039: 71,598.49  \n\nNow we add these up step‐by‐step:\n\n• 70,599.17 + 59,033.00 = 129,632.17  \n• 129,632.17 + 109,167.87 = 238,800.04  \n• 238,800.04 + 54,082.03 = 292,882.07  \n• 292,882.07 + 53,221.91 = 346,103.98  \n• 346,103.98 + 109,886.85 = 455,990.83  \n• 455,990.83 + 36,009.58 = 492,000.41  \n• 492,000.41 + 55,301.53 = 547,301.94  \n• 547,301.94 + 103,420.37 = 650,722.31  \n• 650,722.31 + 36,085.98 = 686,808.29  \n• 686,808.29 + 108,546.96 = 795,355.25  \n• 795,355.25 + 72,772.67 = 868,127.92  \n• 868,127.92 + 69,234.22 = 937,362.14  \n• 937,362.14 + 109,846.60 = 1,047,208.74  \n• 1,047,208.74 + 105,070.66 = 1,152,279.40  \n• 1,152,279.40 + 106,006.64 = 1,258,286.04  \n• 1,258,286.04 + 98,745.90 = 1,357,031.94  \n• 1,357,031.94 + 71,598.49 = 1,428,630.43  \n\nThus, the total “tax_amount” collected on sales in the period is 1,428,630.43. (No separate “tax‐payment” transactions are shown, and we assume an opening balance of zero.) Hence the tax–payable account “increased” by 1,428,630.43 during this period.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"1428630.43\"\n  }\n}\n\nRemember that this procedure is based on summing the tax amounts on sales transactions (which represent the sales tax liability) and is consistent with how many cash flow statements “reconcile” changes in current liabilities when no tax remittance has been recorded.",
