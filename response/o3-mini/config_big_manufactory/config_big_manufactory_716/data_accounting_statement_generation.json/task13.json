                        "content": "We can “build” the value of taxes payable by “adding up” the tax amounts collected on all sale transactions that appear during the period. (In this kind of accounting problem the “taxes payable” item on the balance‐sheet is the liability the firm has (accumulated from running its sales) that still is due for remittance.) Note that the “Initial” transactions – the opening “Cash deposit,” “Bank deposit” and “Fixed Assets” – have no tax component.\n\nLet’s illustrate our reasoning step‐by‐step:\n\n1. Examine the “Sale” rows – only the rows whose “type” is “Sale” are expected to produce a tax amount (the “tax_amount” field in the row). In our data the following sale rows (by their id) have a tax_amount and their values are as follows:\n\n • Sale20240103001:  tax_amount = 70,599.17  \n • Sale20240106004:  tax_amount = 59,033.00  \n • Sale20240107006:  tax_amount = 109,167.87  \n • Sale20240109007:  tax_amount = 54,082.03  \n • Sale20240110009:  tax_amount = 53,221.91  \n • Sale20240113011:  tax_amount = 109,886.85  \n • Sale20240117016:  tax_amount = 36,009.58  \n • Sale20240118017:  tax_amount = 55,301.53  \n • Sale20240119019:  tax_amount = 103,420.37  \n • Sale20240120020:  tax_amount = 36,085.98  \n • Sale20240121022:  tax_amount = 108,546.96  \n • Sale20240124024:  tax_amount = 72,772.67  \n • Sale20240127028:  tax_amount = 69,234.22  \n • Sale20240128030:  tax_amount = 109,846.60  \n • Sale20240130032:  tax_amount = 105,070.66  \n • Sale20240201034:  tax_amount = 106,006.64  \n • Sale20240203036:  tax_amount = 98,745.90  \n • Sale20240204039:  tax_amount = 71,598.49\n\n2. Sum all these tax amounts (the “output tax”) to obtain the new tax liability to be carried on the balance‐sheet (we assume there is no beginning “taxes payable” balance in the period, so the initial “taxes payable” is zero).\n\nLet’s add them step‐by‐step (all amounts are taken from above):\n\n 70,599.17  \n+ 59,033.00  = 129,632.17  \n+ 109,167.87 = 238,800.04  \n+ 54,082.03 = 292,882.07  \n+ 53,221.91 = 346,103.98  \n+ 109,886.85 = 455,990.83  \n+ 36,009.58 = 492,000.41  \n+ 55,301.53 = 547,301.94  \n+ 103,420.37 = 650,722.31  \n+ 36,085.98 = 686,808.29  \n+ 108,546.96 = 795,355.25  \n+ 72,772.67 = 868,127.92  \n+ 69,234.22 = 937,362.14  \n+ 109,846.60 = 1,047,208.74  \n+ 105,070.66 = 1,152,279.40  \n+ 106,006.64 = 1,258,286.04  \n+ 98,745.90 = 1,357,031.94  \n+ 71,598.49 = 1,428,630.43\n\n3. Since none of the “Initial” transactions contained any tax (and none of the “Purchase” or “Expense” ones even have a tax_amount to offset the sales tax) the beginning (or “initial”) taxes payable balance is simply 0.00.\n\n4. The “end” value (after taking into account all the sale transactions during the period) is the total computed above: 1,428,630.43.\n\nThus, we have:\n\n• Taxes Payable Initial Value = 0.00  \n• Taxes Payable End Value = 1,428,630.43\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"1428630.43\"} }",
