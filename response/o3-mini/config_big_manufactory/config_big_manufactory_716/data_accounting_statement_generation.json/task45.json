In our dataset several rows represent a “Fixed Assets Purchase” or “Purchase” of heavy equipment (which are “investing” items) that were paid (i.e. “Paid” status); any items that are “Unpaid” (or that are initial “Fixed Assets” or other operating/financing items) are not counted in the investing cash flows.\n\nBelow we list (by “id” and “type”) the transactions that we include and then sum their amounts (using a “–” sign for cash outflows and “+” for cash receipts):\n\nInvesting outflows (cash paid):\n1.
