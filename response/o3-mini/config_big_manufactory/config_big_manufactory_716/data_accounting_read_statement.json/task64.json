Its End_amount is \"28000000.00\".\n\n• For profit or loss before deducting tax expense, we look at the Income Statement line \"Profit Before Tax\". Its Amount is \"5172748.32\".\n\n• For the addition in the amount owed for goods or services received on credit, we look at the Cash Flow Statement line \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\". Its Amount is \"6600000.00\".\n\nStep 2: Structure the output following the specified group order:\n1. Balance Sheet → value1\n2. Income Statement → value2\n3. Cash Flow Statement → value3\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value1\": \"28000000.00\",\n    \"value2\": \"5172748.32\",\n    \"value3\": \"6600000.00\"\n  }\n}",
