                        "content": "We start by extracting the key numbers from the three statements.\n\n(1) Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n• From the cash‐flow statement, FCF is typically computed as: \n  FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities – Capital Expenditures.\n• Here:\n  Operating CF = –10,442,735.47\n  Capital Expenditures = Purchase of Fixed Assets = 2,479,994.53\nSo,\n  FCF = –10,442,735.47 – 2,479,994.53 = –12,922,730.00\n\n(2) Return on Assets (ROA)\n• ROA is defined as Net Profit divided by average Total Assets.\n• From the balance sheet:\n  Beginning Total Assets = 28,000,000.00\n  Ending Total Assets = 39,772,748.32\n  Average Total Assets = (28,000,000.00 + 39,772,748.32) / 2 \n                = 67,772,748.32 / 2\n                = 33,886,374.16\n• Net Profit from income statement = 3,744,117.89\nThus,\n  ROA = 3,744,117.89 / 33,886,374.16 ≈ 0.1105 or 11.05%\n\n(3) Return on Equity (ROE)\n• ROE is calculated as Net Profit divided by average Owner’s Equity.\n• From the balance sheet:\n  Beginning Owner’s Equity = Paid-in Capital = 28,000,000.00\n  Ending Owner’s Equity = 31,744,117.89\n  Average Owner’s Equity = (28,000,000.00 + 31,744,117.89) / 2 \n              = 59,744,117.89 / 2 \n              ≈ 29,872,058.945\nThus,\n  ROE = 3,744,117.89 / 29,872,058.945 ≈ 0.1254 or 12.54%\n\n(4) Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio \n• This ratio is defined as Operating CF divided by Net Profit.\n• Here:\n  Operating CF = –10,442,735.47\n  Net Profit = 3,744,117.89\nThus,\n  Ratio = –10,442,735.47 / 3,744,117.89 ≈ –2.79\n\n(5) Net Profit Margin \n• Net Profit Margin is calculated as Net Profit divided by Total Revenue (from the income statement) multiplied by 100.\n• Here:\n  Net Profit = 3,744,117.89\n  Total Revenue = 28,572,608.70\nThus,\n  Margin = (3,744,117.89 / 28,572,608.70) × 100 ≈ 13.11%\n\n(6) Gross Profit Margin \n• This margin is computed as Gross Profit divided by Total Revenue multiplied by 100.\n• From the income statement:\n  Gross Profit = 8,372,608.70\n  Total Revenue = 28,572,608.70\nThus,\n  Margin = (8,372,608.70 / 28,572,608.70) × 100 ≈ 29.31%\n\nNow we present the solution in the required JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-12922730.00\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"11.05%\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"12.54%\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-2.79\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"13.11%\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"29.31%\"\n  }\n}",
