Their sum equals:\n\n  6,057,264.53 + 1,020,005.47 = 7,077,270.00\n\nStep 2: Identify the current liabilities (current debt). From the balance sheet, these are given as Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable. Their total is:\n\n  6,600,000.00 + 1,428,630.43 = 8,028,630.43\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Cash to Current Debt Ratio by dividing the cash and cash equivalents by the current liabilities.\n\n  Ratio = 7,077,270.00 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ 0.881\n\nRounded to two decimal places, this ratio is approximately 0.88.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"0.88\"}}",
