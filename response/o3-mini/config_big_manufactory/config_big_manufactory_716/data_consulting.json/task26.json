                        "content": "Step 1. Calculate ROE (Return on Equity)\n• ROE is defined as the Net Profit divided by the Average Owner’s Equity.\n• From the balance sheet:\n – Beginning Owner’s Equity = Paid‑in Capital = 28,000,000.00\n – Ending Owner’s Equity = Total Owner’s Equity = 31,744,117.89\n• Average Owner’s Equity = (28,000,000.00 + 31,744,117.89) / 2 = 29,872,058.945\n• From the income statement, Net Profit = 3,744,117.89\n• ROE = (3,744,117.89 / 29,872,058.945) ≈ 0.1254 or 12.54%\n\nStep 2. Calculate Debt to Asset Ratio\n• Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets.\n• From the balance sheet:\n – Total Liabilities (given by Total Current Liabilities) = 8,028,630.43\n – Total Assets = 39,772,748.32\n• Debt to Asset Ratio = 8,028,630.43 / 39,772,748.32 ≈ 0.202 or 0.20 when rounded\n\nStep 3. Calculate Gross Profit Margin\n• Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Total Revenue.\n• From the income statement:\n – Gross Profit = 8,372,608.70\n – Total Revenue = 28,572,608.70\n• Gross Profit Margin = 8,372,608.70 / 28,572,608.70 ≈ 0.2933, which is about 29.33%\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"12.54%\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.20\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"29.33%\"\n  }\n}",
