                        "content": "We need to calculate five ratios. To do so we must first determine the “average” balances for accounts that start with a zero initial balance (such as Accounts Receivable) and the average of beginning and ending total assets.\n\nStep 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio \n• Formula: Sales / Average Accounts Receivable \n• Sales (from income statement): Main Business Revenue = 28,572,608.70 \n• Accounts Receivable:\n  Beginning (2023-12-31) = 0.00 \n  Ending (2024-02-05) = 14,921,566.06 \n  Average = (0 + 14,921,566.06) / 2 = 7,460,783.03 \n• Ratio = 28,572,608.70 / 7,460,783.03 ≈ 3.83\n\nStep 2. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio \n• Formula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities \n• Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities (from cash flow statement) = –10,442,735.47 \n• Total Current Liabilities (from balance sheet) = 8,028,630.43 \n• Ratio = –10,442,735.47 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ –1.30\n\nStep 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio \nOften this is taken as the operating cash flow divided by current liabilities. (Note: In the example both operating cash flow ratio and operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio were the same.)  \n• Thus, we again get –1.30\n\nStep 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio \n• Formula: Revenue / Average Total Assets \n• Total Assets: \n  Beginning (2023-12-31) = 28,000,000.00 \n  Ending (2024-02-05) = 39,772,748.32 \n  Average = (28,000,000.00 + 39,772,748.32) / 2 = 33,886,374.16 \n• Ratio = 28,572,608.70 / 33,886,374.16 ≈ 0.84\n\nStep 5. Debt to Equity Ratio \n• Formula: Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity \n• Total Liabilities: (here only current liabilities are provided) = 8,028,630.43  \n• Total Owner’s Equity (from balance sheet, end date) = 31,744,117.89 \n• Ratio = 8,028,630.43 / 31,744,117.89 ≈ 0.25\n\nAs requested, the solution in JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.83\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-1.30\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.30\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.84\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.25\"\n  }\n}",
