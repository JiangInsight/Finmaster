Operating Cash Flow Ratio \n  = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Current Liabilities)\n  = (–10,442,735.47) / (8,028,630.43)\n  ≈ –1.30\n\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio \n  (Here “Debt” is taken as the current liabilities, as no non‐current liabilities are provided.)\n  = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Current Liabilities)\n  = (–10,442,735.47) / (8,028,630.43)\n  ≈ –1.30\n\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio \n  Since the beginning inventory is 0, we use the average inventory = (0 + End Inventory) / 2.\n  Average Inventory = 7,400,000 / 2 = 3,700,000\n  = (Cost of Goods Sold) / (Average Inventory)\n  = 20,200,000 / 3,700,000\n  ≈ 5.46\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio \n  = (Total Liabilities) / (Total Owner's Equity)\n  = 8,028,630.43 / 31,744,117.89\n  ≈ 0.25\n\n5. Quick Ratio \n  = (Total Current Assets – Inventory) / (Current Liabilities)\n  = (29,413,723.95 – 7,400,000.00) / (8,028,630.43)\n  = 22,013,723.95 / 8,028,630.43\n  ≈ 2.74\n\n6. Current Ratio \n  = (Total Current Assets) / (Current Liabilities)\n  = 29,413,723.95 / 8,028,630.43\n  ≈ 3.66\n\nThus, the final solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.30\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-1.30\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"5.46\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.25\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"2.74\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"3.66\"\n  }\n}",
