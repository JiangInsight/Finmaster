                        "content": "First, we extract the key items from each statement (using the “end” amounts):\n\n1. From the balance sheet:\n • Total Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43  \n • Total Current Assets = 29,413,723.95  \n • Inventory = 7,400,000.00  \n • Total Owner's Equity = 31,744,117.89  \n • Total Assets = 39,772,748.32  \n • Accounts Receivable = 14,921,566.06  \n\n2. From the cash flow statement:\n • Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities (i.e. Operating Cash Flow) = –10,442,735.47\n\n3. From the income statement:\n • Total Revenue = 28,572,608.70  \n • Net Profit = 3,744,117.89\n\nNow, we calculate each ratio step by step:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n = Operating Cash Flow / Total Current Liabilities  \n = –10,442,735.47 / 8,028,630.43  \n ≈ –1.30\n\n2. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n Here, “Debt” is represented by total liabilities. Since the only liabilities shown are current liabilities, we can use Total Liabilities = Total Assets – Owner’s Equity.  \n = 39,772,748.32 – 31,744,117.89  \n = 8,028,630.43  \n Thus, Debt to Equity Ratio = 8,028,630.43 / 31,744,117.89  \n ≈ 0.25\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n = Total Revenue / Total Assets  \n = 28,572,608.70 / 39,772,748.32  \n ≈ 0.72\n\n4. Quick Ratio  \n = (Current Assets – Inventory) / Current Liabilities  \n = (29,413,723.95 – 7,400,000.00) / 8,028,630.43  \n = 22,013,723.95 / 8,028,630.43  \n ≈ 2.74\n\n5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n This ratio is also calculated as Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n ≈ –1.30\n\n6. Return on Equity (ROE)  \n = Net Profit / Total Owner's Equity  \n = 3,744,117.89 / 31,744,117.89  \n ≈ 0.118 or 11.80%\n\n7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n = Total Revenue / Accounts Receivable  \n = 28,572,608.70 / 14,921,566.06  \n ≈ 1.92\n\nThus, the final solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.30\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.25\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.72\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"2.74\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.30\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"11.80%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"1.92\"\n  }\n}",
