Calculate Debt to Equity Ratio  \n• From the balance sheet, the only liabilities shown are current liabilities.  \n  Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43  \n  Total Owner's Equity = 31,744,117.89  \nThus, Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity  \n  = 8,028,630.43 / 31,744,117.89  \n  ≈ 0.25  \n\nStep 2. Calculate Net Profit Margin  \n• From the income statement:  \n  Net Profit = 3,744,117.89  \n  Total Revenue = 28,572,608.70  \nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100  \n  = (3,744,117.89 / 28,572,608.70) × 100  \n  ≈ 13.11%  \n\nStep 3. Calculate Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n• From the cash flow statement:  \n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -10,442,735.47  \n• From the balance sheet:  \n  Total Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43  \nThus, Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities  \n  = -10,442,735.47 / 8,028,630.43  \n  ≈ -1.30  \n\nNow, we present the answers in the required JSON format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.25\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"13.11%\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.30\"\n  }\n}",
