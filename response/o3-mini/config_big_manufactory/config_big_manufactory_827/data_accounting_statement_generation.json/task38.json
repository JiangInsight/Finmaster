                        "content": "We need to “build up” the ending receivables balance from only those revenue‐(sale) items that have been sold on credit (and any interest receivables that have been earned but not yet received). (In the guidance for the cash‐flow statement the “(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable” line is taken to be the change in working capital – an increase in accounts receivable “uses” cash and is shown as a negative number.)\n\nIn our problem the only “Sale” transactions that affect accounts receivable are only those whose “receive_method” is “Account Receviable” (not “Cash”). Also, the “Interest Receivables” (which are recorded as “Unpaid”) are generally included as part of the working‐capital “accounts receivable” balance.\n\nLet’s list the credit “Sale” lines (note the payment/receipt_status is “Unpaid” so that no cash has yet been received) and note the “after_tax_amount” (which is the customer’s total):\n \n• Sale20240103001 – after_tax_amount: 1,070,083.00  \n• Sale20240108008 – after_tax_amount: 1,027,814.64  \n• Sale20240109009 – after_tax_amount: 1,966,974.59  \n• Sale20240111011 – after_tax_amount: 2,104,292.65  \n• Sale20240117017 – after_tax_amount: 667,858.71  \n• Sale20240125030 – after_tax_amount: 1,252,501.23  \n• Sale20240131038 – after_tax_amount: 1,921,419.93  \n\nIf we add these together we get:\n\n  1,070,083.00  \n+ 1,027,814.64  = 2,097,897.64  \n+ 1,966,974.59  = 4,064,872.23  \n+ 2,104,292.65  = 6,169,164.88  \n+    667,858.71  = 6,837,023.59  \n+ 1,252,501.23  = 8,089,524.82  \n+ 1,921,419.93  = 10,010,944.75  \n\nIn addition, we have many “Interest Receivables” entries (all “Unpaid”). Their individual amounts add up approximately as follows (we sum each line in order):\n\n  1335.0  \n+ 1335.0    = 2670.0  \n+ 1157.0    = 3827.0  \n+ 1085.8    = 4912.8  \n+  996.8    = 5909.6  \n+  729.8    = 6639.4  \n+  658.6    = 7298.0  \n+  658.6    = 7956.6  \n+  587.4    = 8544.0  \n+  509.81    ≈ 9053.81  \n+  509.81    ≈ 9563.63  \n+  331.81    ≈ 9895.44  \n+  331.81    ≈ 10227.26  \n+  331.81    ≈ 10559.07  \n+  331.81    ≈ 10890.88  \n+  331.81    ≈ 11222.70  \n+  242.81    ≈ 11465.51  \n+  242.81    ≈ 11708.33  \n+  149.65    ≈ 11857.98  \n+  149.65    ≈ 12007.63  \n+  149.65    ≈ 12157.28  \n+  149.65    ≈ 12306.93  \n+  149.65    ≈ 12456.58  \n+  98.25    ≈ 12554.83  \n+  98.25    ≈ 12653.09  \n+  98.25    ≈ 12751.34  \n+  98.25    ≈ 12849.60  \n+  98.25    ≈ 12947.85  \n+  98.25    ≈ 13046.11  \n+  98.25    ≈ 13144.36  \n+  98.25    ≈ 13242.61  \n+  9.25     ≈ 13251.87  \n+  9.25     ≈ 13261.12  \n+  98.25    ≈ 13359.38  \n\nThus the total “Interest Receivables” amount is about 13,359.38.\n\nThen the ending “Accounts Receivable” balance (credit sales not yet collected plus interest receivable) is\n\n  10,010,944.75 + 13,359.38 = 10,024,304.13\n\nBecause a rising accounts receivable balance represents a use of cash (that is, cash that is tied up in receivables), in the operating cash‐flow section using the indirect method we show this as a “decrease” in cash (i.e. a negative adjustment).\n\nThus the final “(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable” will be\n\n  –10,024,304.13\n\nBelow is our answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-10024304.13\"}}\n``` \n\nNote: (Any minor rounding differences may occur, but the calculation is based on summing the credit (unpaid) sale amounts plus all unpaid interest receivables.)",
