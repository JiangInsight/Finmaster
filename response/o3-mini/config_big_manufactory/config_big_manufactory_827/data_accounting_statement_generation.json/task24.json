                        "content": "We need to “close‐out” the income statement’s cost-of‑sales item. In our situation (as in the sample example) the “cost” used in a sale is given in the sale record’s “cost_amount” field. (Note that other transactions like administrative/sales/financial expenses, depreciation, “initial” and “fixed asset” records do not go into the “cost” of goods sold.) Therefore, to get the final cost amount (i.e. the “total cost” on the income statement) we add together the cost amounts that were recorded on sales transactions.\n\nLooking at the provided table (the “Problem to Solve” data) look for rows whose type is “Sale.” In each such sale row there is a column named “cost_amount.” (In our table the “cost_amount” field appears typically as the 22nd column.) Let’s list them with the amounts:\n\n1. Sale20240103001: cost_amount = 800000.0  \n2. Sale20240106004: cost_amount = 500000.0  \n3. Sale20240107005: cost_amount = 1000000.0  \n4. Sale20240108008: cost_amount = 800000.0  \n5. Sale20240109009: cost_amount = 1500000.0  \n6. Sale20240111011: cost_amount = 1500000.0  \n7. Sale20240122024: cost_amount = 500000.0  \n8. Sale20240124028: cost_amount = 500000.0  \n9. Sale20240125030: cost_amount = 1000000.0  \n10. Sale20240129034: cost_amount = 1500000.0  \n11. Sale20240131038: cost_amount = 1500000.0  \n12. Sale20240205042: cost_amount = 1500000.0  \n\nNow add these up step‐by‐step:\n\n• After the 1st sale: 800,000.0  \n• 1st + 2nd: 800,000.0 + 500,000.0 = 1,300,000.0  \n• + 3rd: 1,300,000.0 + 1,000,000.0 = 2,300,000.0  \n• + 4th: 2,300,000.0 + 800,000.0 = 3,100,000.0  \n• + 5th: 3,100,000.0 + 1,500,000.0 = 4,600,000.0  \n• + 6th: 4,600,000.0 + 1,500,000.0 = 6,100,000.0  \n• + 7th: 6,100,000.0 + 500,000.0 = 6,600,000.0  \n• + 8th: 6,600,000.0 + 500,000.0 = 7,100,000.0  \n• + 9th: 7,100,000.0 + 1,000,000.0 = 8,100,000.0  \n• + 10th: 8,100,000.0 + 1,500,000.0 = 9,600,000.0  \n• + 11th: 9,600,000.0 + 1,500,000.0 = 11,100,000.0  \n• + 12th: 11,100,000.0 + 1,500,000.0 = 12,600,000.0  \n\nThus the final “total cost” item equals 12,600,000.00.\n\nWe then output the answer in the required JSON format.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Cost\": \"12600000.00\"\n  }\n}",
