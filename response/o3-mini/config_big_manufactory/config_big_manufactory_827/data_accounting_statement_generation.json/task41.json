In our chart the only entry that is recorded “Unpaid” with a payment method of “Account Payable” is the purchase with id Purchase20231231011. Its recorded amount is 1,000,000.0 and because it is not yet paid it is recorded as an outstanding liability (i.e. an increase in accounts payable).\n\nNo other purchase or liability‐related transaction (or subsequent payment reducing a prior liability) appears to affect AP, so the net change is an increase of 1,000,000.00.\n\nThe answer is therefore as follows:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"1000000.00\"\n  }\n}",
