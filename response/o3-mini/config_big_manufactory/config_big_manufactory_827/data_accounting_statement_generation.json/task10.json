                        "content": "We must “build” the book‐value of our property, plant and equipment as follows. In our data the “non‑current assets” come from the …\n\n• a beginning “Initial” record for “Fixed Assets” (the opening balance reported at 2023‑12‑31)  \n• any “acquisitions” made during the period (both regular “Purchase” lines that are capitalized – for products such as “Heavy Equipment …” – and the special “Fixed Assets Purchase” transactions)  \n• then we subtract any “disposals” when an asset was sold (the sale transactions list a “cost_amount”)  \n• and finally we subtract depreciation.\n\nStep‐by‐step we proceed as follows:\n\n1. The opening balance is taken from the “Initial20231231001” row with type “Fixed Assets” and amount = 8,000,000.0.\n\n2. Next, add up all “acquisition” amounts (which are “purchases” that add to the fixed asset base and the fixed‐asset purchase transactions):\n\n  a. From “Purchase” lines (by looking at the rows with product names beginning “Heavy Equipment …”):\n   • Purchase20231231001:   800,000.00  \n   • Purchase20231231002: 2,000,000.00  \n   • Purchase20231231003:  800,000.00  \n   • Purchase20231231004: 1,000,000.00  \n   • Purchase20231231005: 3,000,000.00  \n   • Purchase20231231006:  800,000.00  \n   • Purchase20231231007:  800,000.00  \n   • Purchase20231231008: 3,000,000.00  \n   • Purchase20231231009:  130,000.00  \n   • Purchase20231231010: 2,000,000.00  \n   • Purchase20231231011: 1,000,000.00  \n   • Purchase20231231012: 3,000,000.00  \n\n  Let’s sum these “purchase” amounts:\n   800,000  \n  +2,000,000 = 2,800,000  \n  + 800,000 = 3,600,000  \n  +1,000,000 = 4,600,000  \n  +3,000,000 = 7,600,000  \n  + 800,000 = 8,400,000  \n  + 800,000 = 9,200,000  \n  +3,000,000 =12,200,000  \n  + 130,000 =12,330,000  \n  +2,000,000 =14,330,000  \n  +1,000,000 =15,330,000  \n  +3,000,000 =18,330,000  \n\n  b. From the “Fixed Assets Purchase” rows we have three additions:\n   • FixedAsset20231231001 (first):  871,751.87  \n   • FixedAsset20231231001 (second): 1,046,775.17  \n   • FixedAsset20231231001 (third):  577,494.56  \n  Their total = 871,751.87 + 1,046,775.17 = 1,918,527.04; then plus 577,494.56 gives 2,496,021.60.\n\n  c. Total acquisitions = (sum of “Purchase” lines) + (Fixed Assets Purchase additions)\n   = 18,330,000.00 + 2,496,021.60  \n   = 20,826,021.60.\n\n3. Now the “base” available before disposals and depreciation is the opening fixed assets plus acquisitions:\n  Opening 8,000,000.00 + 20,826,021.60 = 28,826,021.60.\n\n4. Next, subtract the “disposals” from sales. (When an asset is sold its cost is removed.) The sale rows giving non‑current asset cost amounts are (with cost_amount values):\n  • Sale20240103001:   800,000.00  \n  • Sale20240106004:   500,000.00  \n  • Sale20240107005: 1,000,000.00  \n  • Sale20240108008:  800,000.00  \n  • Sale20240109009: 1,500,000.00  \n  • Sale20240111011: 1,500,000.00  \n  • Sale20240117017:  500,000.00  \n  • Sale20240122024:  500,000.00  \n  • Sale20240129034: 1,500,000.00  \n  • Sale20240131038: 1,500,000.00  \n  • Sale20240205042: 1,500,000.00\n\n  Summing these:\n  800,000 + 500,000 = 1,300,000  \n  +1,000,000 = 2,300,000  \n  +800,000 = 3,100,000  \n  +1,500,000 = 4,600,000  \n  +1,500,000 = 6,100,000  \n  +500,000 = 6,600,000  \n  +500,000 = 7,100,000  \n  +1,500,000 = 8,600,000  \n  +1,500,000 =10,100,000  \n  +1,500,000 =11,600,000.\n\n5. Also subtract accumulated depreciation over the period. (Depreciation reduces the carrying amount.) We have two depreciation transactions:\n  • Depreciation20240101001: 45,751.31  \n  • Depreciation20240201002: 93,206.48  \n  Total depreciation = 45,751.31 + 93,206.48 = 138,957.79.\n\n6. Total reductions = Sales disposals (11,600,000.00) + Depreciation (138,957.79) = 11,738,957.79.\n\n7. Finally, the End Value of the property, plant and equipment is:\n  28,826,021.60 – 11,738,957.79 = 17,087,063.81.\n\nThus, according to our step‐by‐step aggregation:\n\n• Total Non‑current Assets Initial Value = 8,000,000.00  \n• Total Non‑current Assets End Value = 17,087,063.81\n\nPresenting the answer as requested:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"17087063.81\"\n  }\n}",
