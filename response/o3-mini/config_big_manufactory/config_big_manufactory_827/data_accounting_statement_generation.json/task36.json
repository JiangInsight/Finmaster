                        "content": "We must “roll‐up” the operating results by “adding” the income–items (mainly the profit shown on each sale plus the interest income from all “Interest Receivable” records) and “subtracting” all of the expense items (that is, all the “Expense” lines – whether Administrative, Sales or Financial – plus depreciation). (Other “investing” items such as Purchases, Fixed Assets and Transfers do not affect the net profit.)\n\nIn our data the “Sale” lines already come with a “profit” field; these are pre‐computed contributions from each sale. (For example, one sale shows an “after tax” amount, a cost and then a computed “profit” as well as the tax–side being “added back” to the result.)Then we also add the amounts from every “Interest Receivables” record (which represent interest income) and finally subtract the “Expense” amounts and the “Depreciation” amounts.\n\nStep 1. Sum the “profit” fields on every Sale record. (There are 13 sale lines:)\n\n  Sale20240103001: 326403.16  \n  Sale20240106004: 184558.74  \n  Sale20240107005: 354106.17  \n  Sale20240108008: 281910.15  \n  Sale20240109009: 570499.57  \n  Sale20240111011: 715044.89  \n  Sale20240117017: 203009.17  \n  Sale20240122024: 152509.01  \n  Sale20240124028: 236928.63  \n  Sale20240125030: 318422.35  \n  Sale20240129034: 452322.13  \n  Sale20240131038: 522547.30  \n  Sale20240205042: 644176.18  \n\nWhen added these yield approximately 4,962,437.45.\n\nStep 2. Sum all “Interest Receivables” amounts. (There are many – see below; when all are added the total is about 13,654.14.)\n\nStep 3. Sum every “Expense” amount. (All Expense records of types “Administrative Expenses”, “Sales Expenses” and “Financial Expenses” add up to about 2,658,166.19.)\n\nStep 4. Sum all “Depreciation” amounts. In our file there are two depreciation records whose amounts (45751.31 and 93206.48) add up to approximately 138,957.79.\n\nStep 5. Now, the “net profit” is computed as\n\n  Net Profit = (Total Sale profit + Total Interest income)\n        – (Total Expenses + Total Depreciation)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n  Net Profit ≈ (4,962,437.45 + 13,654.14) – (2,658,166.19 + 138,957.79)\n         = 4,976,091.59 – 2,797,123.98\n         ≈ 2,178,967.61\n\nThus the final net profit is about 2,178,967.61.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"2178967.61\"}}",
