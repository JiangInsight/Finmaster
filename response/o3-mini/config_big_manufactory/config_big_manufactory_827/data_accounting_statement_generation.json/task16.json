                        "content": "We need to work out the \"paid-in capital\" from the transactions. The paid‐in capital is the amount the owners inject into the business. In our recording system the paid‐in capital is recorded by the initial “Initial20231231001” entries. In our new problem the three lines with id Initial20231231001 are:\n\n• Cash deposit: amount = 5,000,000.00  \n• Bank deposit: amount = 15,000,000.00  \n• Fixed Assets: amount = 8,000,000.00  \n\nWhen you add these together a total of (5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000) equals 28,000,000.00. Since no subsequent “capital injection” or adjustment transactions occur that affect owner’s equity (the other transactions belong to purchases, expenses, sales etc, and so normally do not alter the paid-in capital), the “final” paid-in capital remains the same as the initial injected amount.\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\", \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"28000000.00\"} }",
