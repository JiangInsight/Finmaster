                        "content": "We need to “net‐out” the operating result (that is, the “net income” earned during the period) from all the revenue‐ and expense–related transactions. In many accounting systems, the “retained earnings” balance is assumed to start at zero at the very beginning followed by “net income” (or “net loss”) being added (or deducted) over the period. (No opening retained earnings is recorded in the “Initial” rows, which instead record the “starting” balance‐sheet items such as cash, bank and fixed assets.) \n\nFor example, a simplified approach is as follows:\n\n• Identify the “income” items – in this case the revenue coming from “Sale” records. In each sale record the “profit” field shows how much the sale earned over the cost of the product. (In our data each sale record has a “profit” value which is already computed for that transaction.)\n\n• Also include “other revenue” such as “Interest Receivables” which (although not always “collected”) are recorded as revenue.\n\n• Then identify the “expense” items. These include the many “Expense” rows (whether Administrative, Sales, or Financial) and the “Depreciation” transactions. (Purchases and fixed‐asset acquisitions are not “charged” against income in the period—they are recorded on the balance sheet.) \n\nThe net income for the period is then taken as\n\n  Net income = (sum of sale profits + sum of interest revenue)\n         – (sum of expenses + sum of depreciation)\n\nFor the new problem the approximate calculations are (all amounts in currency units):\n\n1. Total profit on Sales \n  = 326403.16 + 184558.74 + 354106.17 + 281910.15 + 570499.57 + 715044.89 + 203009.17 + 152509.01 + 236928.63 + 318422.35 + 452322.13 + 522547.30 + 644176.18 \n  ≈ 4,962,437.45\n\n2. Total “Interest Receivables” revenue  \n  ≈ 13,457.63\n\n3. Sum of all “Expense” items (all the Administrative, Sales, Financial expenses)  \n  ≈ 2,676,000.68  \n  and the two Depreciation entries (45751.31 + 93206.48 = 138,957.79)  \n  Thus, expenses + depreciation ≈ 2,814,958.47\n\n4. Therefore, the net income is  \n  = (4,962,437.45 + 13,457.63) – 2,814,958.47  \n  ≈ 2,160,936.61\n\nFinally, if we assume that no beginning retained earnings existed (just as in the sample solution where the “Retained Earnings Initial Value” was given as 0.00), then the retained earnings at period‑end will simply equal the net income.\n\nThus, we arrive at:\n\n  Retained Earnings Initial Value = 0.00  \n  Retained Earnings End Value = 2160936.61\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"2160936.61\"}}\n``` \n\nNote: In practical settings each line item would be gathered and summed exactly (possibly with rounding differences), but the above reflects a careful step‐by‐step treatment based on the provided transactions.",
