                        "content": "We can “build” the balance‐sheet “Fixed Assets” total by starting with the beginning fixed assets value (from the “Initial” row for Fixed Assets), then adding (capitalizing) all new acquisitions made during the period while reducing the asset balance for any disposals and for depreciation.\n\nIn our data the following must be noted:\n\n1. The beginning “Fixed Assets” entry is recorded on 2023‑12‑31 with an amount of 8,000,000.0.\n\n2. Several “Purchase” transactions on 2023‑12‑31 relate to items that by their nature (Heavy Equipment – A, B, C, D) are fixed‐asset items. Their amounts are as follows:\n  • Purchase20231231001: 8.0×10^5  \n  • Purchase20231231002: 2,000,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231003: 800,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231004: 1,000,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231005: 3,000,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231006: 800,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231007: 800,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231008: 3,000,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231009: 1,000,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231010: 2,000,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231011: 1,000,000.0  \n  • Purchase20231231012: 3,000,000.0  \nAdding these gives a total fixed‐asset purchase of 19,200,000.0.\n\n3. In addition there are two dedicated “Fixed Assets Purchase” entries (the id begins with “FixedAsset20231231001”) that add further amounts:\n  • one for 871,751.87  \n  • one for 1,046,775.17  \nTogether these add 1,918,527.04.\n\nThus the “gross” fixed assets–that is, before disposals and depreciation–are computed as:\n  8,000,000.0 + 19,200,000.0 + 1,918,527.04 = 29,118,527.04\n\n4. Next, several “Sale” transactions (all with products whose names begin “Heavy Equipment …”) represent disposals of fixed assets. Their “cost_amount” values (the cost that is removed from the books) are:\n  • Sale20240103001: 800,000.0  \n  • Sale20240106004: 500,000.0  \n  • Sale20240107005: 1,000,000.0  \n  • Sale20240108008: 800,000.0  \n  • Sale20240109009: 1,500,000.0  \n  • Sale20240111011: 1,500,000.0  \n  • Sale20240117017: 500,000.0  \n  • Sale20240122024: 500,000.0  \n  • Sale20240124028: 500,000.0  \n  • Sale20240125030: 1,000,000.0  \n  • Sale20240129034: 1,500,000.0  \n  • Sale20240131038: 1,500,000.0  \n  • Sale20240205042: 1,500,000.0  \nTheir total cost (to be removed) is 13,100,000.0.\n\n5. Finally, the period’s depreciation is recorded in two transactions:\n  • Depreciation20240101001: 45,751.31  \n  • Depreciation20240201002: 93,206.48  \nwhich sum to 138,957.79.\n\nThus the “net” (end‐of–period) fixed asset value is calculated as follows:\n  Final = (Beginning + Acquisitions) – (Disposals + Depreciation)\n    = 29,118,527.04 – (13,100,000.0 + 138,957.79)\n    = 29,118,527.04 – 13,238,957.79\n    ≈ 15,879,569.25\n\nOur answer is then to show the fixed asset “initial” value as the beginning “Fixed Assets” entry (8,000,000.00) and the “end‐of–period” fixed assets as about 15,879,569.25.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"15879569.25\"}}\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nNote:\n• We assume that all purchase transactions whose product names refer to “Heavy Equipment” are capitalized as fixed assets.\n• Disposals are removed at their cost amounts.\n• Depreciation is deducted from the gross fixed asset balance.",
