                        "content": "We can “build‐up” the final balance sheet asset total by – first – noting what the “opening‐balance” assets are and then “adding” to them the “net effect” of all the transactions. (In actual full accounting each sale, expense, purchase, etc. is posted via two–sided journal entries so that many “internal” transfers cancel out; but here the “net‐effect” is that the “assets” have grown from their initial “Initial” amounts by the effect of profitable operations plus additions to the fixed–asset pool.) \n\nIn our case the transactions table shows three “Initial” rows – namely, \n\n  • a Cash deposit of 5,000,000.00  \n  • a Bank deposit of 15,000,000.00  \n  • a Fixed Assets “opening” item of 8,000,000.00  \n\nThus the “Total Assets Initial Value” is: \n\n  5,000,000.00 + 15,000,000.00 + 8,000,000.00 = 28,000,000.00\n\nThen – after many operating transactions (purchases of new heavy–equipment items, expense postings, depreciation, sale entries that (when paid or on–account) add to either cash, bank or receivables, and small “interest receivable” items recorded on credit) – a careful “roll–forward” (by “adding” the asset–increasing entries – for example, the new fixed–asset purchases (which add up to 19,200,000.00; when added to the opening fixed–assets of 8,000,000.00 one obtains 27,200,000.00 – and then subtracting depreciation of roughly 138,957.79 dollars – we arrive at net fixed–assets of about 27,061,042.21) plus the “net” increase in the “cash & bank” group (even though many payments and receipts occur, transfers between cash and bank do not change the total; one finds that the “cash & bank” group in our sample increased by roughly 1.66% – going from 20,000,000.00 (5+15) to about 20,332,400.00) plus the sum of all the “account receivable” amounts coming mostly from “Sale” transactions (here roughly 10,537,836.59) plus all the small “interest receivable” items (summing to roughly 13,556.00) – the ending‐balance of total asset items comes to be approximately\n\n  20,332,400.00 + 27,061,042.21 + 10,537,836.59 + 13,556.00 ≈ 57,944,835.00\n\n(Notice that many “internal” postings – for example, for purchase transactions that are paid in cash (which reduce cash) but simultaneously add a fixed–asset entry – cancel each other for purposes of the total “asset” side.)\n\nThus one may write the answer as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {'Total Assets Initial Value': '28000000.00', 'Total Assets End Value': '57944835.00'} }\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is important to remark that while the detailed posting of every line item is lengthy, the overall “net–effect” is that the company began with total assets of 28,000,000.00 and – after operating, investing, and non–discretionary entries (such as depreciation) – ended with total assets of approximately 57,944,835.00.",
