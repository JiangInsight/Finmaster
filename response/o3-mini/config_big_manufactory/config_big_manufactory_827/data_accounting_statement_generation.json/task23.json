                        "content": "We start by “walking‐through” the job of finding cost of goods sold. In our system every sale transaction carries a “cost_amount” field that represents (approximately) the cost of the inventory that was sold. (Other transactions show purchases, interest, expenses – but for COGS purposes we need the cumulative “cost_amount” associated with each sale.) \n\nIn the provided data the “Sale” rows (with type = Sale) include a “cost_amount” value. (In posting systems using inventory costing the “cost_amount” becomes the cost side of the sale.) We list the sale rows along with their cost amounts:\n\n1. Sale20240103001 – cost_amount = 800,000.00  \n2. Sale20240106004 – cost_amount = 500,000.00  \n3. Sale20240107005 – cost_amount = 1,000,000.00  \n4. Sale20240108008 – cost_amount = 800,000.00  \n5. Sale20240109009 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.00  \n6. Sale20240111011 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.00  \n7. Sale20240117017 – cost_amount = 500,000.00  \n8. Sale20240122024 – cost_amount = 500,000.00  \n9. Sale20240124028 – cost_amount = 500,000.00  \n10. Sale20240125030 – cost_amount = 1,000,000.00  \n11. Sale20240129034 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.00  \n12. Sale20240131038 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.00  \n13. Sale20240205042 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.00  \n\nNow, add these up step‐by‐step:\n\n  800,000.00  \n+ 500,000.00 = 1,300,000.00  \n+ 1,000,000.00 = 2,300,000.00  \n+ 800,000.00 = 3,100,000.00  \n+ 1,500,000.00 = 4,600,000.00  \n+ 1,500,000.00 = 6,100,000.00  \n+ 500,000.00 = 6,600,000.00  \n+ 500,000.00 = 7,100,000.00  \n+ 500,000.00 = 7,600,000.00  \n+ 1,000,000.00 = 8,600,000.00  \n+ 1,500,000.00 = 10,100,000.00  \n+ 1,500,000.00 = 11,600,000.00  \n+ 1,500,000.00 = 13,100,000.00  \n\nThus, the final cost of goods sold is 13,100,000.00.\n\nWe now present our answer in the required JSON format.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"13100000.00\"}\n}",
