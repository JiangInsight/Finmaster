                        "content": "We “build up” the taxes payable balance from the transactions that affect tax liability. In this example we assume no tax liability at the very beginning (the “Initial” transactions do not include any tax‐related amounts) so the initial taxes payable are 0.00. Then, for every sale transaction the “tax_amount” field represents the tax liability earned on the sale. Thus the end-of‐period balance is taken as the sum of all tax amounts on sales.\n\nLooking at the sales in the provided “problem” data (rows whose type is “Sale”), we have these sales and their tax amounts:\n\n1. Sale20240103001: tax_amount = 56,320.16  \n2. Sale20240106004: tax_amount = 34,227.94  \n3. Sale20240107005: tax_amount = 67,705.31  \n4. Sale20240108008: tax_amount = 54,095.51  \n5. Sale20240109009: tax_amount = 103,524.98  \n6. Sale20240111011: tax_amount = 110,752.24  \n7. Sale20240117017: tax_amount = 35,150.46  \n8. Sale20240122024: tax_amount = 32,625.45  \n9. Sale20240124028: tax_amount = 36,846.43  \n10. Sale20240125030: tax_amount = 65,921.12  \n11. Sale20240129034: tax_amount = 97,616.11  \n12. Sale20240131038: tax_amount = 101,127.37  \n13. Sale20240205042: tax_amount = 107,208.81  \n\nNow, by summing these values step‐by‐step:\n\n• 56,320.16 + 34,227.94 = 90,548.10  \n• 90,548.10 + 67,705.31 = 158,253.41  \n• 158,253.41 + 54,095.51 = 212,348.92  \n• 212,348.92 + 103,524.98 = 315,873.90  \n• 315,873.90 + 110,752.24 = 426,626.14  \n• 426,626.14 + 35,150.46 = 461,776.60  \n• 461,776.60 + 32,625.45 = 494,402.05  \n• 494,402.05 + 36,846.43 = 531,248.48  \n• 531,248.48 + 65,921.12 = 597,169.60  \n• 597,169.60 + 97,616.11 = 694,785.71  \n• 694,785.71 + 101,127.37 = 795,913.08  \n• 795,913.08 + 107,208.81 = 903,121.89  \n\nThus the total taxes payable at the end is 903,121.89.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Taxes Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Taxes Payable End Value': '903121.89'} }",
