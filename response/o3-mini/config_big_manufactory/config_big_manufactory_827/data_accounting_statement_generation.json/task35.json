Adding up all sale “after_tax_amount” values yielded a Main Business (and Total) Revenue of 17,159,315.56. Similarly, summing all “cost_amount” values for the sale transactions gave 13,100,000.00 as the Cost of Goods Sold (and Total Cost).\n\n2. • The Gross Profit was computed as Revenue minus COGS:  \n  Gross Profit = 17,159,315.56 – 13,100,000.00 = 4,059,315.56.\n\n3. • Next, we reviewed all “Expense” rows and allocated them by their category based on the “type” field. Administrative Expenses were taken from rows labeled “Administrative Expenses” (summing to 863,669.20) while Selling Expenses were those with “Sales Expenses” (totaling 1,385,949.93). Financial Expenses from rows labeled “Financial Expenses” summed to 298,850.66. Depreciation (a separate transaction type) was computed from both depreciation entries (45,751.31 + 93,206.48 = 138,957.79).\n\n4. • Total operating expenses is the sum of Administrative + Selling + Financial Expenses + Depreciation = 863,669.20 + 1,385,949.93 + 298,850.66 + 138,957.79 = 2,687,427.58.\n\n5. • For Interest Income we summed all “Interest Receivables” amounts (across many entries, many with small amounts) and obtained 12,509.84.\n\n6. • Profit Before Tax is then computed as Gross Profit minus Total Operating Expenses plus Interest Income, that is, 4,059,315.56 – 2,687,427.58 + 12,509.84 = 1,384,397.82.\n\n7. • Assuming a tax rate of approximately 20% (similar to the sample’s effective rate), Tax Expense = 20% of Profit Before Tax = 0.20 × 1,384,397.82 = 276,879.56.\n\n8. • Finally, Net Profit = Profit Before Tax – Tax Expense = 1,384,397.82 – 276,879.56 = 1,107,518.26.\n\nAll of the above amounts are represented as strings in the output JSON.\n",
