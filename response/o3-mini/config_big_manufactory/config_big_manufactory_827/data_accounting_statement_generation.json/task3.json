                        "content": "We must “build” the inventory balance from the transactions that affect items purchased for resale (or production) versus those items that were sold. (In our books only the “Purchase” and “Sale” records with product details affect the inventory “stock”.) Notice that the “Initial” transactions record cash, bank funds, fixed assets, etc. but not merchandise held for resale. (In the sample problem the “Inventory Initial Value” was 0.00 because no inventory was carried in from prior periods.) \n\nStep 1. Identify the purchase transactions (which “add” inventory) and sum their cost amounts. In our data the following Purchase transactions give us the inventory purchased:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001 – Heavy Equipment B  \n  • Quantity: 1.0  \n  • Cost per unit: 800000.0  → Total = 800000.0\n\n2. Purchase20231231002 – Heavy Equipment C  \n  • Quantity: 2.0  \n  • Cost per unit: 1000000.0  → Total = 2000000.0\n\n3. Purchase20231231003 – Heavy Equipment B  \n  • Quantity: 1.0  \n  • Cost per unit: 800000.0  → Total = 800000.0\n\n4. Purchase20231231004 – Heavy Equipment A  \n  • Quantity: 2.0  \n  • Cost per unit: 500000.0  → Total = 1000000.0\n\n5. Purchase20231231005 – Heavy Equipment D  \n  • Quantity: 2.0  \n  • Cost per unit: 1500000.0  → Total = 3000000.0\n\n6. Purchase20231231006 – Heavy Equipment B  \n  • Quantity: 1.0  \n  • Cost per unit: 800000.0  → Total = 800000.0\n\n7. Purchase20231231007 – Heavy Equipment B  \n  • Quantity: 1.0  \n  • Cost per unit: 800000.0  → Total = 800000.0\n\n8. Purchase20231231008 – Heavy Equipment D  \n  • Quantity: 2.0  \n  • Cost per unit: 1500000.0  → Total = 3000000.0\n\n9. Purchase20231231009 – Heavy Equipment A  \n  • Quantity: 2.0  \n  • Cost per unit: 500000.0  → Total = 1000000.0\n\n10. Purchase20231231010 – Heavy Equipment C  \n  • Quantity: 2.0  \n  • Cost per unit: 1000000.0  → Total = 2000000.0\n\n11. Purchase20231231011 – Heavy Equipment A  \n  • Quantity: 2.0  \n  • Cost per unit: 500000.0  → Total = 1000000.0\n\n12. Purchase20231231012 – Heavy Equipment D  \n  • Quantity: 2.0  \n  • Cost per unit: 1500000.0  → Total = 3000000.0\n\nNow add these totals:  \n800000 + 2000000 = 2800000  \n+ 800000 = 3600000  \n+ 1000000 = 4600000  \n+ 3000000 = 7600000  \n+ 800000 = 8400000  \n+ 800000 = 9200000  \n+ 3000000 = 12200000  \n+ 1000000 = 13200000  \n+ 2000000 = 15200000  \n+ 1000000 = 16200000  \n+ 3000000 = 19200000\n\nSo the total cost purchased equals 19,200,000.\n\nStep 2. Identify the sale transactions (which “remove” inventory) and sum the cost amounts (the field “cost_amount” in each sale record represents the cost of the goods sold).\n\nThe sale transactions are:\n\n1. Sale20240103001 – Heavy Equipment B  \n  Cost_amount: 800000.0\n\n2. Sale20240106004 – Heavy Equipment A  \n  Cost_amount: 500000.0\n\n3. Sale20240107005 – Heavy Equipment C  \n  Cost_amount: 1000000.0\n\n4. Sale20240108008 – Heavy Equipment B  \n  Cost_amount: 800000.0\n\n5. Sale20240109009 – Heavy Equipment D  \n  Cost_amount: 1500000.0\n\n6. Sale20240111011 – Heavy Equipment D  \n  Cost_amount: 1500000.0\n\n7. Sale20240117017 – Heavy Equipment A  \n  Cost_amount: 500000.0\n\n8. Sale20240122024 – Heavy Equipment A  \n  Cost_amount: 500000.0\n\n9. Sale20240124028 – Heavy Equipment A  \n  Cost_amount: 500000.0\n\n10. Sale20240125030 – Heavy Equipment C  \n  Cost_amount: 1000000.0\n\n11. Sale20240129034 – Heavy Equipment D  \n  Cost_amount: 1500000.0\n\n12. Sale20240131038 – Heavy Equipment D  \n  Cost_amount: 1500000.0\n\n13. Sale20240205042 – Heavy Equipment D  \n  Cost_amount: 1500000.0\n\nNow sum these cost amounts:  \n800000 + 500000 = 1300000  \n+ 1000000 = 2300000  \n+ 800000 = 3100000  \n+ 1500000 = 4600000  \n+ 1500000 = 6100000  \n+ 500000 = 6600000  \n+ 500000 = 7100000  \n+ 500000 = 7600000  \n+ 1000000 = 8600000  \n+ 1500000 = 10100000  \n+ 1500000 = 11600000  \n+ 1500000 = 13100000\n\nSo the total cost removed (cost of goods sold) equals 13,100,000.\n\nStep 3. Determine the inventory balances:\n• The “Inventory Initial Value” is taken from the previous period. In our case (and as in the sample problem) no beginning inventory was carried in so it is 0.00.\n• The “Inventory End Value” is the cumulative purchases less the cost of the goods that have been sold. That is:\n  Inventory End Value = 19,200,000 – 13,100,000 = 6,100,000\n\nSo the final inventory value on the balance sheet equals 6,100,000.00.\n\nThus, the answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Inventory End Value\": \"6100000.00\"\n  }\n}",
