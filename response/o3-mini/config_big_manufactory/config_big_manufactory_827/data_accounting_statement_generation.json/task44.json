In our data the only rows that “purchase” fixed assets are the ones whose type is “Fixed Assets Purchase.” (Other “Purchase” rows refer mostly to operating or inventory purchases and are not included.) \n\nReviewing the data we see three “Fixed Assets Purchase” transactions (its id is “FixedAsset20231231001” in all cases but with different amounts):\n\n1. A row with amount 871751.87 (asset “Heavy Machinery4”).\n2. A row with amount 1046775.17 (asset “Industrial Facilities5”).\n3. A row with amount 577494.56 (asset “Production Line Equipment6”).\n\nBy summing these:\n  871751.87 + 1046775.17 = 1918527.04  \n  1918527.04 + 577494.56 = 2496021.60\n\nThus the final purchase of fixed assets (i.e. the cash outflow allocated to acquiring fixed assets) is 2496021.60.\n\nWe now present the answer as:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"2496021.60\"}}",
