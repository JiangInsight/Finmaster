                        "content": "We must “filter‐in” only the transactions that represent investing activities (that is, cash flows related to buying or selling long‐term assets such as fixed assets). In our data the only items to be considered for investing are those whose type indicates a purchase of a fixed asset (or receipt of cash from sale of a fixed asset). (Note that the “Initial…” entries are opening balances and do not themselves count as cash flows.) Also note that only transactions whose “payment/receipt_status” is “Paid” (or otherwise you can judge they actually affect cash) will count toward the “net” cash flow.\n\nBelow is one way to “read” the data step‐by‐step (all amounts are in monetary units):\n\n1. Outflows (cash spent to acquire fixed assets):\n • Row “Purchase20231231001” (Purchase of Heavy Equipment B): –800,000.0\n • Row “Purchase20231231002” (Purchase of Heavy Equipment C): –2,000,000.0\n • Row “Purchase20231231003” (Purchase of Heavy Equipment B): –800,000.0 \n • Row “Purchase20231231004” (Purchase of Heavy Equipment A): –1,000,000.0 \n • Row “Purchase20231231005” (Purchase of Heavy Equipment D): –3,000,000.0 \n • Row “Purchase20231231006” (Purchase of Heavy Equipment B): –800,000.0 \n • Row “Purchase20231231007” (Purchase of Heavy Equipment B): –800,000.0 \n • Row “Purchase20231231008” (Purchase of Heavy Equipment D): –3,000,000.0 \n • Row “FixedAsset20231231001” (Fixed Assets Purchase): –871,751.87 \n • Row “Purchase20231231009” (Purchase of Heavy Equipment A): –1,000,000.0 \n • Row “Purchase20231231010” (Purchase of Heavy Equipment C): –2,000,000.0 \n • Row “FixedAsset20231231001” (the second fixed asset purchase, row 68) –1,046,775.17 \n • Row “FixedAsset20231231001” (the later one, row 85) –577,494.56 \n • Row “Purchase20231231012” (Purchase of Heavy Equipment D): –3,000,000.0\n\nIf you add those negatives you get:\n  800,000 + 2,000,000 = 2,800,000  \n  + 800,000 = 3,600,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 4,600,000  \n  + 3,000,000 = 7,600,000  \n  + 800,000 = 8,400,000  \n  + 800,000 = 9,200,000  \n  + 3,000,000 = 12,200,000  \n  + 871,751.87 = 13,071,751.87  \n  + 1,000,000 = 14,071,751.87  \n  + 2,000,000 = 16,071,751.87  \n  + 1,046,775.17 = 17,118,527.04  \n  + 577,494.56 = 17,696,021.60  \n  + 3,000,000 = 20,696,021.60  \n\nSo the total cash outflow is –20,696,021.60.\n\n2. Inflows (cash received from selling fixed assets):\n • Row “Sale20240106004” (Sale of Heavy Equipment A): +684,558.74  \n • Row “Sale20240107005” (Sale of Heavy Equipment C): +1,354,106.17  \n • Row “Sale20240122024” (Sale of Heavy Equipment A): +652,509.01  \n • Row “Sale20240124028” (Sale of Heavy Equipment A): +736,928.63  \n • Row “Sale20240129034” (Sale of Heavy Equipment D): +1,952,322.13  \n • Row “Sale20240205042” (Sale of Heavy Equipment D): +2,144,176.18  \n\nSumming these inflows:\n  684,558.74 + 1,354,106.17 = 2,038,664.91  \n  + 652,509.01 = 2,691,173.92  \n  + 736,928.63 = 3,428,102.55  \n  + 1,952,322.13 = 5,380,424.68  \n  + 2,144,176.18 = 7,524,600.86  \n\n3. Finally, net cash flow from investing activities is the sum of investing cash inflows plus outflows:\n Net = Inflows – Outflows = 7,524,600.86 – 20,696,021.60  \n      = –13,171,420.74\n\nThus, the net cash used in investing activities is about –13,171,420.74.\n\nWe now present the answer in the required json format.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-13171420.74\"\n  }\n}",
