                        "content": "We need first to “seed” the cash‐on‐hand account with the opening “Cash deposit” (only that row from the “Initial…” set enters the cash on hand, whereas “Bank deposit” and “Fixed Assets” go to other balance sheet areas). Then we “simulate” the cash flows – only transactions that “use Cash” (or that move money “to/from cash”) affect the cash‐on‐hand balance.\n\nFor example, in the sample problem the only initial cash on hand was taken from the “Cash deposit” (3,000,000.00) and after adding “cash inflows” (for sales paid by cash and “bank-to‑cash transfers”) and subtracting “cash payments” (expenses, purchases paid by cash, “cash‐to‑bank transfers”) the ending cash was computed as 270005.90.\n\nIn the problem at hand the transactions are given in date order. (A full step‐by‐step “tally” is shown below.)\n\nStep 1. The initial “Initial20231231001” entries:\n• Cash deposit “5000000.0” (this is the cash‐on‐hand opening balance).\n• Bank deposit 15000000 and Fixed Assets 8000000 are recorded elsewhere.\n\nStep 2. Now go through each subsequent transaction that uses the “Cash” payment method (or is a bank↔cash transfer). When a row has “Paid” and “Cash” as its payment_method the amount is treated as an outflow if it is an expense or purchase (money “leaving” cash) and as an inflow when it is a cash sale or when money is transferred into cash.\n\nBelow is a summary (with subtraction “–” and addition “+”) which was “tallied” sequentially:\n\n• Purchase20231231001 – Purchase paid by Cash: –800000.00  \n•

to approximately 3,041,600.26.\n\nThus the solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"3041600.26\"\n  }\n}\n\n(Notice that we carefully “picked out” only the transactions that affect the cash account from the full list, and the final net result—after subtracting expenses, cash purchases and cash-to-bank transfers and adding cash sales plus bank-to-cash transfers—yields the ending cash on hand.)",
