                        "content": "We can “build” the current liabilities balance by looking only for transactions that add a due‐amount (i.e. “unpaid” purchases that are recorded as “Account Payable”). In our data the “Initial” records (the three “Initial20231231001” lines – Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) set up the balance‐sheet’s asset side (they do not include any payable/liability amounts) – so at the very start no current liabilities are recorded. \n\nThen we check all “Purchase” transactions. Most “Purchase” transactions were paid so they did not leave any unpaid obligation. (Other types like “Expense”, “Depreciation” or “Interest Receivables” affect profit or assets rather than current liabilities.) \n\nThe only purchase that was recorded with a payment/receipt_status of “Unpaid” – and with a payment method of “Account Payable” (a typical current liability) – is the one on line 92:\n  • Transaction id “Purchase20231231011” – Purchase of Heavy Equipment A – with a recorded amount of 1,000,000.0. \n\nThus the beginning balance in liabilities was zero (since no “initial” liability was recorded) and by the end of this period the only outstanding (unpaid) liability is 1,000,000.0.\n\nSo, our answer is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"1000000.00\"\n  }\n}",
