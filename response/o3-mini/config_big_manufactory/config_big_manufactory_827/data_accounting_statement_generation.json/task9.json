                        "content": "We have an “Initial” fixed assets balance coming from the Initial20231231001 row (“Fixed Assets” row) and then many transactions on 2023‑12‑31 increase fixed assets (by purchasing heavy equipment) while later “Sale” transactions with fixed‑asset products remove those items. Finally the depreciation transactions reduce the book value further. One may “net‐off” all these to get the final net fixed assets.\n\nStep 1. Initial balance \n • From the “Initial20231231001” row with type “Fixed Assets” the value is 8,000,000.00.\n\nStep 2. Compute all “additions” (purchases that add to fixed assets)\nThey come from purchase-type (or FixedAsset–type) transactions that refer to heavy equipment or similar. In our list these are (all amounts are in monetary units):\n\n 1. Purchase20231231001 (Heavy Equipment B):       800,000.00  \n 2. Purchase20231231002 (Heavy Equipment C, quantity 2):  2,000,000.00  \n 3. Purchase20231231003 (Heavy Equipment B):       800,000.00  \n 4. Purchase20231231004 (Heavy Equipment A, quantity 2):  1,000,000.00  \n 5. Purchase20231231005 (Heavy Equipment D, quantity 2):  3,000,000.00  \n 6. Purchase20231231006 (Heavy Equipment B):       800,000.00  \n 7. FixedAsset20231231001 (Fixed Assets Purchase – “Heavy Machinery4”): 871,751.87  \n 8. Purchase20231231007 (Heavy Equipment B):       800,000.00  \n 9. Purchase20231231008 (Heavy Equipment D, quantity 2):  3,000,000.00  \n 10. Purchase20231231009 (Heavy Equipment A, quantity 2):  1,000,000.00  \n 11. Purchase20231231010 (Heavy Equipment C, quantity 2):  2,000,000.00  \n 12. Purchase20231231011 (Heavy Equipment D, quantity 2):  1,000,000.00  \n 13. Purchase20231231012 (Heavy Equipment D, quantity 2):  3,000,000.00  \n\nSumming these additions step‐by‐step:\n 800,000 + 2,000,000 = 2,800,000  \n + 800,000 = 3,600,000  \n + 1,000,000 = 4,600,000  \n + 3,000,000 = 7,600,000  \n + 800,000 = 8,400,000  \n + 871,751.87 = 9,271,751.87  \n + 800,000 = 10,071,751.87  \n + 3,000,000 = 13,071,751.87  \n + 1,000,000 = 14,071,751.87  \n + 2,000,000 = 16,071,751.87  \n + 1,000,000 = 17,071,751.87  \n + 3,000,000 = 20,071,751.87  \n\nSo total additions = 20,071,751.87.\n\nStep 3. Compute “disposals” from sales (removals of fixed assets)\nThese are sales whose product is one of the heavy equipment items (A/B/C/D). The “cost_amount” in a sale transaction represents the cost (or carrying value) of the disposed asset. The relevant sale transactions are:\n\n • Sale20240103001 (Heavy Equipment B):   800,000.00  \n • Sale20240106004 (Heavy Equipment A):   500,000.00  \n • Sale20240107005 (Heavy Equipment C):   1,000,000.00  \n • Sale20240108008 (Heavy Equipment B):   800,000.00  \n • Sale20240109009 (Heavy Equipment D):   1,500,000.00  \n • Sale20240111011 (Heavy Equipment D):   1,500,000.00  \n • Sale20240117017 (Heavy Equipment A):   500,000.00  \n • Sale20240122024 (Heavy Equipment A):   500,000.00  \n • Sale20240124028 (Heavy Equipment A):   500,000.00  \n • Sale20240125030 (Heavy Equipment C):   1,000,000.00  \n • Sale20240129034 (Heavy Equipment D):   1,500,000.00  \n • Sale20240131038 (Heavy Equipment D):   1,500,000.00  \n • Sale20240205042 (Heavy Equipment D):   1,500,000.00  \n\nNow summing these:\n 800,000  \n+ 500,000 = 1,300,000  \n+ 1,000,000 = 2,300,000  \n+ 800,000 = 3,100,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 4,600,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 6,100,000  \n+ 500,000 = 6,600,000  \n+ 500,000 = 7,100,000  \n+ 500,000 = 7,600,000  \n+ 1,000,000 = 8,600,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 10,100,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 11,600,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 13,100,000  \n\nSo total disposals = 13,100,000.00.\n\nStep 4. Combine initial and additions then subtract disposals\n Total before depreciation = Initial + Additions – Disposals  \n  = 8,000,000.00 + 20,071,751.87 – 13,100,000.00  \n  = 28,071,751.87 – 13,100,000.00  \n  = 14,971,751.87\n\nStep 5. Subtract “depreciation” (which reduces the net book value)\nThe depreciation transactions are:\n • Depreciation20240101001: 45,751.31  \n • Depreciation20240201002: 93,206.48  \nTotal depreciation = 45,751.31 + 93,206.48 = 138,957.79\n\nStep 6. Final net fixed assets value calculation:\n Net Fixed Assets End Value = (Initial + Additions – Disposals) – Depreciation  \n  = 14,971,751.87 – 138,957.79  \n  ≈ 14,832,794.08\n\nThus the answers are:\n\n• Fixed assets net Initial Value: 8,000,000.00  \n• Fixed assets net End Value: 14,832,794.08\n\nPresenting our answer in the required json format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"fixed assets net Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"fixed assets net End Value\": \"14832794.08\"\n  }\n}",
