                        "content": "We must “reconstruct” the inventory flows from the transaction‐data. In an operating cash‐flow statement (using the indirect method) the “Increase (Decrease) in Inventory” is determined by the difference between what the business “buys” as inventory and what is “sold” (whose cost is “taken out” as the cost of goods sold). In this case each purchase (of “Heavy Equipment …”) represents an addition to inventory and each sale (which shows a “cost_amount”) represents a reduction in inventory. (Any asset purchase that is not held for resale – for example genuine fixed asset purchases – is not “inventory”.)\n\nStep 1. Identify purchase transactions that “build inventory” (here “Purchase” lines that include product details):\n • Purchase20231231001: 800,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231002: 2,000,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231003: 800,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231004: 1,000,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231005: 3,000,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231006: 800,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231007: 800,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231008: 3,000,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231009: 1,000,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231010: 2,000,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231011: 1,000,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231012: 3,000,000.00  \n\nSumming these gives:  \n 800,000 + 2,000,000 = 2,800,000  \n + 800,000 = 3,600,000  \n + 1,000,000 = 4,600,000  \n + 3,000,000 = 7,600,000  \n + 800,000 = 8,400,000  \n + 800,000 = 9,200,000  \n + 3,000,000 = 12,200,000  \n + 1,000,000 = 13,200,000  \n + 2,000,000 = 15,200,000  \n + 1,000,000 = 16,200,000  \n + 3,000,000 = 19,200,000.00\n\nStep 2. Identify sale transactions that “use up” inventory (the “cost_amount” in each Sale). The sale rows show a “cost_amount” that is taken from inventory. These are:\n • Sale20240103001: 800,000.00  \n • Sale20240106004: 500,000.00  \n • Sale20240107005: 1,000,000.00  \n • Sale20240108008: 800,000.00  \n • Sale20240109009: 1,500,000.00  \n • Sale20240111011: 1,500,000.00  \n • Sale20240117017: 500,000.00  \n • Sale20240122024: 500,000.00  \n • Sale20240124028: 500,000.00  \n • Sale20240125030: 1,000,000.00  \n • Sale20240129034: 1,500,000.00  \n • Sale20240131038: 1,500,000.00  \n • Sale20240205042: 1,500,000.00  \n\nSumming these gives:  \n 800,000 + 500,000 = 1,300,000  \n + 1,000,000 = 2,300,000  \n + 800,000 = 3,100,000  \n + 1,500,000 = 4,600,000  \n + 1,500,000 = 6,100,000  \n + 500,000 = 6,600,000  \n + 500,000 = 7,100,000  \n + 500,000 = 7,600,000  \n + 1,000,000 = 8,600,000  \n + 1,500,000 = 10,100,000  \n + 1,500,000 = 11,600,000  \n + 1,500,000 = 13,100,000.00\n\nStep 3. The ending (or “on‐hand”) inventory value is roughly the purchases less cost that “left”. In other words, change in inventory = Total Purchases – Total COGS =  \n 19,200,000.00 – 13,100,000.00 = 6,100,000.00\n\nIn a cash flow statement an increase in inventory is shown as a use of cash (a negative adjustment). Therefore, the “(Increase) Decrease in Inventory” is –6,100,000.00.\n\nThus the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-6100000.00\"\n  }\n}",
