                        "content": "We must “build” the balance‐sheet item “accounts receivable” by “capturing” (a) any sale revenues that have not been “paid” (that is, where the sale was recorded with the “receive_method” set to “Account Receviable”), and (b) any “interest receivable” amounts that have been recorded (and not “paid”). In our “initial” records (on 2023‑12‑31) there is no entry that “builds” an accounts‐receivable balance so we start at 0.00. Then for each transaction after the beginning that “adds” to accounts receivable we add its amount. (Any sale where the customer did not pay in cash – that is, with “receive_method” equal to “Account Receviable” – increases the AR, and likewise each “Interest Receivables” line that is “Unpaid” adds to it.)\n\nFor example, in our data the following transactions increase AR (all amounts are “recorded amounts”):\n\n• Sale20240103001 – a sale of Heavy Equipment B for 1,126,403.16  \n• Sale20240109009 – a sale of Heavy Equipment D for 2,070,499.57  \n• Sale20240111011 – a sale of Heavy Equipment D for 2,215,044.89  \n• Sale20240117017 – a sale of Heavy Equipment A for 703,009.17  \n• Sale20240131038 – a sale of Heavy Equipment D for 2,022,547.30\n\nIn addition a large number of “Interest Receivables” (always marked “Unpaid” and with “Interest receviable” noted) add up through many small contributions. (For example, the first “Interest Receivables” entry is for 1,335.00; later there are many entries of values such as 509.81, 331.81, 98.25 etc.) When we add each of these amounts in the order of the transactions the “running‐total” at the end comes out to be approximately 10,551,391.48.\n\nThus, because no receivable existed at the start, the “initial” accounts receivable is 0.00 and when we sum every AR contribution from the Summary (both “Sale” items with receive_method “Account Receviable” and “Interest Receivables”) we obtain an end‐of–period accounts receivable value of about 10,551,391.48.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n     \"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n     \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"10551391.48\"\n  }\n}",
