In our case this means the records with types such as “Expense…” (whether they are Administrative, Sales, or Financial) plus the Depreciation lines (which are “Depreciation…”). (Items such as “Purchase”, “Initial”, “Fixed Assets …”, “Sale”, “Interest Receivables” and transfers are not expenses.)\n\nBelow is a step‐by‐step sketch of the calculation (all amounts are taken from the “amount” field):\n\n1.
