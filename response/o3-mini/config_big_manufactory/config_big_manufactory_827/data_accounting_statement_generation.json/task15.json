                        "content": "We must “pick‐out” only those transactions that add to “liabilities” – that is, those transactions where (a) the business incurs an obligation (for example, it has purchased something but not yet paid for it) and (b) the payment status is “Unpaid” (often also shown with payment method “Account Payable”). In our sample problem the “Initial” transactions are all simply the starting opening‐balances for assets (cash, bank, fixed assets) so no liability is recorded initially. In our table the only transaction that creates a liability is the one “Purchase” transaction that is recorded with an “Unpaid” status (and with payment method “Account Payable”). (All other “Purchase” transactions appear with “Paid” and so are settled immediately.) \n\nLet’s check briefly (note that interest receivables even when “Unpaid” are assets, and outbreak “Sale” receivables are assets too):\n\n• Opening “Initial” rows (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) record no liability.\n• In the list there is one purchase:\n  Purchase20231231011 – its row shows:\n   • type: Purchase\n   • amount: 1000000.0\n   • payment/receipt_status: Unpaid \n   • payment_method: Account Payable  \nThus this transaction creates an obligation (a liability) of 1,000,000.0.\n• No other transaction in the list adds to a “liability” because the “unpaid” items that occur in “Interest Receivables” or “Sale” are part of assets (money to be received – receivables) and not payables.\n\nThus we conclude that (a) at the start there is no liability balance, so “Total Liabilities Initial Value” is 0.00 and (b) adding the single unpaid purchase we have a “Total Liabilities End Value” of 1000000.00.\n\nThe answer is therefore:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"1000000.00\"\n  }\n}",
