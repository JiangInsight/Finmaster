                        "content": "We can “build” the owner’s‐equity number by “starting” with the invested (initial) amounts and then “adjusting” it for the period’s net result (the “net income”) that comes from all operating results – income and expenses. (Purchases that merely change the composition of assets do not “hit” net income while capitalized items–and transfers–don’t affect equity at all.) \n\nBelow is one way to “think‐through” the problem:\n\n• First, the “initial” contributions (“Initial20231231001”) are three transactions:\n  – Cash deposit:    5,000,000.00 \n  – Bank deposit:    15,000,000.00 \n  – Fixed Assets:    8,000,000.00 \n  ----------------------------------------------------------------\n  Initial owners equity = 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 28,000,000.00\n\n• Next, the “final” (end–of–period) owner’s equity is computed by “adding” the net earnings of the period to the initial equity. (We assume no drawings or contributions during the period.) \n\nFor this problem the “net income” is determined – roughly – as follows. In our records the “Sale” transactions include a “profit” value (that is, revenue minus direct–costs) and there are many other “Expense” transactions (including administrative/sales/financial expenses and depreciation) that reduce profit. Also, those “Interest Receivables” represent income (even if not yet paid). (Other transactions like Purchases and Transfers do not hit the income statement.)\n\nA quick summary of the work (all numbers are in monetary units):\n\n1. Sum of profit figures shown on the “Sale” transactions (we list each one below):\n  • Sale20240103001:   326,403.16 \n  • Sale20240106004:   184,558.74 \n  • Sale20240107005:   354,106.17 \n  • Sale20240108008:   281,910.15 \n  • Sale20240109009:   570,499.57 \n  • Sale20240111011:   715,044.89 \n  • Sale20240117017:   203,009.17 \n  • Sale20240122024:   152,509.01 \n  • Sale20240124028:   236,928.63 \n  • Sale20240125030:   318,422.35 \n  • Sale20240129034:   452,322.13 \n  • Sale20240131038:   522,547.30 \n  • Sale20240205042:   644,176.18 \n  ---------------------------------------------------------\n  Total sales profit ≈ 4,962,437.45\n\n2. Sum of “Interest Receivables” (all positive income entries) totals about 13,555.89.\n\n3. Next, add up all the “Expense”–type transactions (the “Expense…” rows: administrative, sales, financial, etc.) plus the Depreciation entries. In our working the many expense items (there are over 50 rows) add roughly to 2,628,625.48; then we add the two Depreciation items (45,751.31 and 93,206.48) whose sum is about 138,957.79. So the total “out–goings” that reduce income come to roughly:\n  2,628,625.48 + 138,957.79 = 2,767,583.27\n\n4. Therefore, the net income is estimated to be:\n  (net income) = (Sales profit + Interest income) – Total expenses \n    ≈ (4,962,437.45 + 13,555.89) – 2,767,583.27 \n    ≈ 4,975,993.34 – 2,767,583.27 \n    ≈ 2,208,410.07\n\n5. Finally, add this net income to the initial owners’ equity:\n  Final owner’s equity ≈ 28,000,000.00 + 2,208,410.07 \n    ≈ 30,208,410.07\n\nUsing two–decimal formatting we obtain:\n\n• Total Owners Equity Initial Value = 28,000,000.00 \n• Total Owners Equity End Value = 30,208,410.07\n\nOften (in practice) you would compute these sums by “automating” the additions; here we “reasoned” step‐by–step. \n\nBelow is the answer in the required output JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\", \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"30208410.07\"} }\n```",
