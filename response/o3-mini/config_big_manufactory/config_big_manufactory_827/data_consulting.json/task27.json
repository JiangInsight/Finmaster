                        "content": "We first note the three ratios we want to compute and then use data taken from the ending dates of each statement.\n\n1. Net Cash Ratio (interpreted here as the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio):  \n  = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Net Profit)  \n  From the cash flow statement, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –13,358,400.82  \n  From the income statement, Net Profit = 1,250,911.98  \n  Thus, Ratio = –13,358,400.82 / 1,250,911.98 ≈ –10.68\n\n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio:  \n  This is computed as Total Revenue divided by the Average Current Assets.  \n  From the income statement, Total Revenue = 18,062,437.45  \n  From the balance sheet, the Current Assets at the beginning = 20,000,000.00 and at the ending = 20,796,970.06.  \n  Average Current Assets = (20,000,000.00 + 20,796,970.06) / 2 = 20,398,485.03  \n  Thus, Ratio = 18,062,437.45 / 20,398,485.03 ≈ 0.885, which we round to 0.89\n\n3. Quick Ratio:  \n  = (Current Assets – Inventory) / Current Liabilities  \n  From the balance sheet at the ending date:  \n  Current Assets = 20,796,970.06  \n  Inventory = 6,100,000.00  \n  Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89  \n  Quick Assets = 20,796,970.06 – 6,100,000.00 = 14,696,970.06  \n  Thus, Ratio = 14,696,970.06 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ 7.723, which rounds to 7.72\n\nThus, the final values are:\n\n{\n  \"Net Cash Ratio\": \"-10.68\",\n  \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.89\",\n  \"Quick Ratio\": \"7.72\"\n}\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Ratio\": \"-10.68\", \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.89\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"7.72\"}}",
