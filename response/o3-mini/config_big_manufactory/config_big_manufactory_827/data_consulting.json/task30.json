                        "content": "We start by extracting the key numbers from the balance sheet (using End_amount values):\n\n1. Total Current Assets = 20,796,970.06  \n2. Inventory = 6,100,000.00  \n3. To compute the “quick” (acid-test) assets, we remove Inventory from Current Assets. However, we must add only those current items that are instantly liquid. Here the items are:  \n • Cash on Hand = 3,041,599.18  \n • Bank Deposits = 1,103,978.40  \n • Interest Receivable = 13,555.89  \n • Accounts Receivable = 10,537,836.59  \n\nCalculating the sum of these liquid assets:  \n 3,041,599.18 + 1,103,978.40 = 4,145,577.58  \n 4,145,577.58 + 13,555.89 = 4,159,133.47  \n 4,159,133.47 + 10,537,836.59 = 14,696,970.06  \n\n4. Total Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89  \n5. Total Assets = 31,154,033.87  \n6. Owner’s Equity = 29,250,911.98  \n7. Total Liabilities (since there is no non-current debt provided) = Total Assets – Owner’s Equity = 31,154,033.87 – 29,250,911.98 = 1,903,121.89\n\nNow, using the cash flow statement:  \n• Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –13,358,400.82\n\nCalculations:\n\nA. Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \n = 20,796,970.06 / 1,903,121.89  \n ≈ 10.93\n\nB. Quick Ratio = (Current Assets – Inventory) / Current Liabilities  \n = 14,696,970.06 / 1,903,121.89  \n ≈ 7.72\n\nC. Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets  \n = 1,903,121.89 / 31,154,033.87  \n ≈ 0.06\n\nD. Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Owner’s Equity  \n = 1,903,121.89 / 29,250,911.98  \n ≈ 0.07\n\nE. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Liabilities  \n = –13,358,400.82 / 1,903,121.89  \n ≈ –7.02\n\nThus, the final solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"10.93\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"7.72\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.06\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.07\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-7.02\"\n  }\n}",
