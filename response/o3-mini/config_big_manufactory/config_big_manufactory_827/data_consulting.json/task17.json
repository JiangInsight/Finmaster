In the example provided, we use Total Current Liabilities, which are the sum of Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable. For this problem, these are:\n  Accounts Payable = 1,000,000.00\n  Taxes Payable = 903,121.89\n  Total Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n\nStep 2: From the cash flow statement, take the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities, which is given as –13,358,400.82.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio by dividing the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities by the Total Current Liabilities:\n  Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = (–13,358,400.82) / (1,903,121.89) ≈ –7.02\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-7.02\"\n  }\n}",
