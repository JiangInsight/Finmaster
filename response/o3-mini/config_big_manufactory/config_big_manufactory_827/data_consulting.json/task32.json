                        "content": "We can solve the problem by working out each figure step‐by‐step. In our example:\n\n1. Free Cash Flow (FCF) is typically computed as:\n  FCF = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) – (Capital Expenditures)\nIn the cash flow section the two numbers are:\n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –13,358,400.82 \n  Purchase of Fixed Assets (Capital Expenditures) = 2,496,021.60 \nEquivalently, the “Net Increase” in cash is provided, which is the sum of operating and investing flows:\n  –13,358,400.82 + (–2,496,021.60) = –15,854,422.42 \nThus, we take:\n  Free Cash Flow (FCF) = –15,854,422.42\n\n2. Return on Assets (ROA) is given by:\n  ROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) × 100%\nUsing the ending values:\n  Net Profit = 1,250,911.98 \n  Total Assets = 31,154,033.87 \nSo, ROA = (1,250,911.98 / 31,154,033.87) × 100% ≈ 4.02%\n\n3. Return on Equity (ROE) is given by:\n  ROE = (Net Profit / Total Owner's Equity) × 100%\nHere:\n  Net Profit = 1,250,911.98 \n  Total Owner's Equity = 29,250,911.98 \nThus, ROE = (1,250,911.98 / 29,250,911.98) × 100% ≈ 4.28%\n\n4. Net Cash Ratio – In the sample the “Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio” was computed as:\n  Operating Cash Flow / Net Profit.\nHere that becomes:\n  Ratio = (–13,358,400.82 / 1,250,911.98) ≈ –10.68\n(The negative sign indicates that while the net profit is positive, the operating cash flow is negative.)\n\n5. Net Profit Margin is given by:\n  Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\nFrom the income statement:\n  Net Profit = 1,250,911.98 \n  Total Revenue = 18,062,437.45 \nThus, Net Profit Margin = (1,250,911.98 / 18,062,437.45) × 100% ≈ 6.93%\n\n6. Gross Profit Margin is computed as:\n  Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\nWhere:\n  Gross Profit = 4,962,437.45 \n  Total Revenue = 18,062,437.45 \nTherefore, Gross Profit Margin = (4,962,437.45 / 18,062,437.45) × 100% ≈ 27.49%\n\nPutting these together in the required JSON format, we get:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-15854422.42', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '4.02%', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '4.28%', 'Net Cash Ratio': '-10.68', 'Net Profit Margin': '6.93%', 'Gross Profit Margin': '27.49%'}}",
