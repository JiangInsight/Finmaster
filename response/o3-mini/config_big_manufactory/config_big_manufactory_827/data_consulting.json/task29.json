                        "content": "We first extract the relevant amounts from the provided statements. For the calculations below we use the End_amount values.\n\n1. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n • Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89  \n • Total Owner’s Equity = 29,250,911.98  \n  Calculation:  \n   Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity  \n    = 1,903,121.89 / 29,250,911.98 ≈ 0.0651  \n  Rounded to two decimal places, this gives 0.07.\n\n2. Net Profit Margin  \n • Net Profit (from income statement) = 1,250,911.98  \n • Total Revenue (from income statement) = 18,062,437.45  \n  Calculation:  \n   Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100  \n    = (1,250,911.98 / 18,062,437.45) × 100 ≈ 6.93%  \n\n3. Return on Assets (ROA)  \n • Total Assets (from balance sheet) = 31,154,033.87  \n • Net Profit = 1,250,911.98  \n  Calculation:  \n   ROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) × 100  \n    = (1,250,911.98 / 31,154,033.87) × 100 ≈ 4.02%\n\n4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n Typically, we calculate this ratio as:  \n  Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n Since the beginning Accounts Receivable is 0 and the ending is 10,537,836.59, we use the average:  \n  Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 10,537,836.59) / 2 = 5,268,918.295  \n  Calculation:  \n   Accounts Receivable Turnover = 18,062,437.45 / 5,268,918.295 ≈ 3.43\n\nThus, the final answers in the required JSON format are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.07\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"6.93%\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"4.02%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.43\"\n  }\n}",
