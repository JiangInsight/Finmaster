                        "content": "We can solve this problem step by step. (Note that unless “average” amounts are provided explicitly, we use the beginning and ending balances to compute averages for ratios that require them. The example used averages when computing ROE and accounts receivable turnover.) \n\nStep 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio \n• From the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is –13,358,400.82.\n• From the balance sheet, the Total Current Liabilities (end) is 1,903,121.89.\n• Ratio = –13,358,400.82 ÷ 1,903,121.89 ≈ –7.02.\n\nStep 2. Debt to Equity Ratio \n• The balance sheet shows that the only liabilities provided are current liabilities of 1,903,121.89.\n• The ending Total Owner‘s Equity is 29,250,911.98.\n• Ratio = 1,903,121.89 ÷ 29,250,911.98 ≈ 0.065, which rounds to 0.07.\n\nStep 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio \n• Using Total Revenue of 18,062,437.45 (from the income statement) and Total Assets (end) of 31,154,033.87,\n• Ratio = 18,062,437.45 ÷ 31,154,033.87 ≈ 0.58.\n\nStep 4. Quick Ratio \n• “Quick Assets” are computed as Total Current Assets minus Inventory. Here:\n  Total Current Assets (end) = 20,796,970.06\n  Inventory = 6,100,000.00\n  Quick Assets = 20,796,970.06 – 6,100,000.00 = 14,696,970.06.\n• Dividing by Current Liabilities gives:\n  Quick Ratio = 14,696,970.06 ÷ 1,903,121.89 ≈ 7.72.\n\nStep 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio \n• This is defined in the same manner as the operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio.\n• Thus, Ratio ≈ –7.02.\n\nStep 6. Return on Equity (ROE) \n• We use the average Owner’s Equity. The beginning Owner’s Equity is 28,000,000.00 and the ending Owner’s Equity is 29,250,911.98.\n  Average Owner’s Equity = (28,000,000.00 + 29,250,911.98) ÷ 2 = 28,625,455.99.\n• Net Profit (from the income statement) is 1,250,911.98.\n• ROE = 1,250,911.98 ÷ 28,625,455.99 ≈ 0.0437 or 4.37%.\n\nStep 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio \n• Accounts receivable at the end is 10,537,836.59 and at the beginning it is 0. Thus the average Accounts Receivable is:\n  (0 + 10,537,836.59) ÷ 2 = 5,268,918.30.\n• Using Total Revenue (18,062,437.45) for this ratio,\n  Accounts Receivable Turnover = 18,062,437.45 ÷ 5,268,918.30 ≈ 3.43.\n\nNow we present the answers in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-7.02\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.07\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.58\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"7.72\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-7.02\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"4.37%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.43\"\n  }\n}",
