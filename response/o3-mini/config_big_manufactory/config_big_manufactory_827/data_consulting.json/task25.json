In this balance sheet, only Total Current Liabilities are provided, which is 1,903,121.89.  \n• Total Owner’s Equity at the end date is 29,250,911.98.  \n• Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity  \n  = 1,903,121.89 / 29,250,911.98  \n  ≈ 0.06507 → Rounded to two decimal places gives 0.07.\n\nStep 2: Calculate Net Profit Margin  \n• Net Profit from the income statement is 1,250,911.98.  \n• Total Revenue is 18,062,437.45.  \n• Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100  \n  = (1,250,911.98 / 18,062,437.45) × 100  \n  ≈ 6.927% → Rounded to two decimal places gives 6.93%.\n\nStep 3: Calculate Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n• Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities from the cash flow statement is –13,358,400.82.  \n• Total Current Liabilities is 1,903,121.89.  \n• Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n  = –13,358,400.82 / 1,903,121.89  \n  ≈ –7.016 → Rounded to two decimal places gives –7.02.\n\nNow, in the required JSON format the solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.07\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"6.93%\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-7.02\"\n  }\n}",
