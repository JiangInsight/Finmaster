                        "content": "{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-7.02\", \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-7.02\", \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"4.30\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.07\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"7.72\", \"Current Ratio\": \"10.93\"}}\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\n   - Formula: Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities.\n   - In the cash flow statement, “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities” = -13,358,400.82.\n   - From the balance sheet, “Total Current Liabilities” = 1,903,121.89.\n   - Calculation: -13,358,400.82 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ -7.02.\n\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:\n   - Since no non‐current debt is separately provided, “Total Debt” is taken as the Total Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89.\n   - Thus, Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -13,358,400.82 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ -7.02.\n\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio:\n   - Formula: Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory.\n   - With initial Inventory = 0 and ending Inventory = 6,100,000.00, average inventory = (0 + 6,100,000.00) / 2 = 3,050,000.00.\n   - Cost of Goods Sold (from the income statement) = 13,100,000.00.\n   - Calculation: 13,100,000.00 / 3,050,000.00 ≈ 4.30.\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio:\n   - Formula: Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity.\n   - Total Liabilities (only current liabilities are provided) = 1,903,121.89.\n   - Total Owner's Equity = 29,250,911.98.\n   - Calculation: 1,903,121.89 / 29,250,911.98 ≈ 0.065, which rounds to 0.07.\n\n5. Quick Ratio:\n   - The quick assets include Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, and Accounts Receivable.\n   - Sum of quick assets = 3,041,599.18 (Cash on Hand) + 1,103,978.40 (Bank Deposits) + 10,537,836.59 (Accounts Receivable) + 13,555.89 (Interest Receivable) = 14,696,970.06.\n   - Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Total Current Liabilities = 14,696,970.06 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ 7.72.\n\n6. Current Ratio:\n   - Formula: Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities.\n   - From the balance sheet, Total Current Assets = 20,796,970.06.\n   - Calculation: 20,796,970.06 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ 10.93.\n\nThe final values are rounded to two decimal places where applicable.",
