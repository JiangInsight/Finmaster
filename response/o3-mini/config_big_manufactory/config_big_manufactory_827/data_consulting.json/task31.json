                        "content": "We first explain how each ratio is computed.\n\n1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n• Formula: \n  Total Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable\n• Since on 2023‑12‑31 the Accounts Receivable was 0 and on 2024‑02‑05 it is 10,537,836.59, the average is:\n  (0 + 10,537,836.59) / 2 = 5,268,918.295\n• Total Revenue (from income statement) is 18,062,437.45.\n• Thus, the ratio = 18,062,437.45 / 5,268,918.295 ≈ 3.43\n\n2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio \n  and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n• In our data, the “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities” is –13,358,400.82 and “Total Current Liabilities” is 1,903,121.89.\n• The ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities = –13,358,400.82 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ –7.02\n• (In the example both ratios are identical.)\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n• Formula: \n  Total Revenue / Average Total Assets\n• Here, beginning Total Assets was 28,000,000.00 and ending Total Assets is 31,154,033.87.\n• Average Total Assets = (28,000,000.00 + 31,154,033.87) / 2 = 29,577,016.935\n• Thus, the ratio = 18,062,437.45 / 29,577,016.935 ≈ 0.61\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n• Formula:\n  Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity\n• The liabilities (in this problem the only items under liabilities are the current liabilities) total 1,903,121.89, and the ending Owner’s Equity is 29,250,911.98.\n• Therefore, Debt to Equity Ratio = 1,903,121.89 / 29,250,911.98 ≈ 0.0651, which rounds to about 0.07.\n\nThus, we present the final results in the required format.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.43\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-7.02\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-7.02\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.61\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.07\"\n  }\n}",
