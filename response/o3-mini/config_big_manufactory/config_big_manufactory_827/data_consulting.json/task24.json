Find Total Liabilities (or “Debt”).  \nFrom the balance sheet we see only current liabilities:  \n • Accounts Payable: 1,000,000.00  \n • Taxes Payable: 903,121.89  \nThus, Total Liabilities = 1,000,000.00 + 903,121.89 = 1,903,121.89\n\nStep 2. Find Total Assets.  \nThe balance sheet shows Total Assets (as of 2024‑02‑05) = 31,154,033.87\n\nStep 3. Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio.  \nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets  \n= 1,903,121.89 / 31,154,033.87  \n≈ 0.0611  \nRounded (e.g., to two decimals) it is about 0.06\n\nStep 4. Calculate the Net Cash Ratio.  \n“Net Cash” is usually obtained from the Cash & Cash Equivalents listed on the balance sheet. (Here we use “Cash on Hand” and “Bank Deposits” which sum to the ending cash balance.)  \n• Cash on Hand (Ending) = 3,041,599.18  \n• Bank Deposits (Ending) = 1,103,978.40  \nTheir sum = 3,041,599.18 + 1,103,978.40 = 4,145,577.58\n\nThen, the Net Cash Ratio is calculated as:  \nNet Cash Ratio = (Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits) / Total Liabilities  \n= 4,145,577.58 / 1,903,121.89  \n≈ 2.178  \nRounded (to two decimals) it is about 2.18\n\nThus, the final results are:  \n Debt to Asset Ratio ≈ 0.06  \n Net Cash Ratio ≈ 2.18\n\nPresenting the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.06\",\n    \"Net Cash Ratio\": \"2.18\"\n  }\n}",
