                        "content": "Step 1. Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio.\n• Debt is represented by the liabilities on the balance sheet. In this problem only current liabilities are given:\n Accounts Payable = 1,000,000.00 \n Taxes Payable = 903,121.89 \n Total Liabilities = 1,903,121.89 \n• Total Assets at period end = 31,154,033.87 \n Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets = 1,903,121.89 / 31,154,033.87 ≈ 0.0611 \n Rounded to two decimals, the Debt to Asset Ratio is 0.06.\n\nStep 2. Calculate the Gross Profit Margin.\n• From the income statement:\n Gross Profit = 4,962,437.45 \n Total Revenue = 18,062,437.45 \n Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100 = (4,962,437.45 / 18,062,437.45) × 100 ≈ 27.49%\n We report the result as 27.49%.\n\nStep 3. Calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n• From the cash flow statement:\n Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –13,358,400.82 \n• Current Liabilities (from the balance sheet) = 1,903,121.89 \n Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Current Liabilities \n = –13,358,400.82 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ –7.017 \n Rounded to two decimals, this ratio is –7.02.\n\nThus, the final solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.06\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"27.49%\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-7.02\"\n  }\n}",
