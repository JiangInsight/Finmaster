                        "content": "We start by extracting the key numbers from the statements:\n\n1. Cash Flow from Operating Activities: –17,417,367.15  \n   Current Liabilities: 727,140.68  \n   • Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow ÷ Current Liabilities  \n  = –17,417,367.15 ÷ 727,140.68 ≈ –23.95  \n\n2. Assuming “Debt” for the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio represents current liabilities (as no long‐term debt is reported), we have:  \n   • Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow ÷ Current Liabilities = –17,417,367.15 ÷ 727,140.68 ≈ –23.95  \n\n3. For the Inventory Turnover Ratio, we use Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and average inventory.  \n   • COGS = 10,400,000.00  \n   • Inventory at the start of period was 0 and at the end is 8,400,000.00, so the average inventory is (0 + 8,400,000.00) ÷ 2 = 4,200,000.00  \n   • Inventory Turnover Ratio = COGS ÷ Average Inventory = 10,400,000.00 ÷ 4,200,000.00 ≈ 2.48  \n\n4. For the Debt to Equity Ratio, we use total liabilities and owner’s equity.  \n   • Total Liabilities (in this case the only current liability) = 727,140.68  \n   • Owner's Equity = 28,405,999.64  \n   • Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities ÷ Owner’s Equity = 727,140.68 ÷ 28,405,999.64 ≈ 0.03  \n\n5. The Quick Ratio excludes inventory.  \n   • Total Current Assets = 21,224,639.20  \n   • Inventory = 8,400,000.00  \n   • Quick Assets = 21,224,639.20 – 8,400,000.00 = 12,824,639.20  \n   • Quick Ratio = Quick Assets ÷ Current Liabilities = 12,824,639.20 ÷ 727,140.68 ≈ 17.63  \n\n6. The Current Ratio uses total current assets.  \n   • Current Ratio = Total Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities = 21,224,639.20 ÷ 727,140.68 ≈ 29.20  \n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-23.95\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-23.95\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"2.48\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"17.63\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"29.20\"\n  }\n}",
