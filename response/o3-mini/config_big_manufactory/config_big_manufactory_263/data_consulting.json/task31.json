                        "content": "We first extract the required balances from the provided statements and then calculate each ratio. Note that many “turnover” ratios use an average balance when beginning‐of‐period balance is available. In our case, beginning Accounts Receivable and beginning Total Assets are zero or given so we compute averages accordingly.\n\n1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n• Definition: Main Business Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n• From the income statement, Main Business Revenue = 14,542,813.42  \n• From the balance sheet, beginning Accounts Receivable = 0.00 and ending Accounts Receivable = 10,221,447.35  \n• Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 10,221,447.35) / 2 = 5,110,723.675  \n• Ratio = 14,542,813.42 / 5,110,723.675 ≈ 2.85\n\n2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n• Definition: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities divided by Total Current Liabilities.  \n• From the cash flow and balance sheet statements:  \n – Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –17,417,367.15  \n – Total Current Liabilities = 727,140.68  \n• Ratio = –17,417,367.15 / 727,140.68 ≈ –23.96  \n(Since the sample showed the two measures as the same, we report identical values.)\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n• Definition: Main Business Revenue / Average Total Assets  \n• From the income statement, Revenue = 14,542,813.42  \n• From the balance sheet, beginning Total Assets = 28,000,000.00 and ending Total Assets = 29,133,140.32  \n• Average Total Assets = (28,000,000.00 + 29,133,140.32) / 2 = 28,566,570.16  \n• Ratio = 14,542,813.42 / 28,566,570.16 ≈ 0.51\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n• Definition: Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity  \n• From the balance sheet:  \n – Total Liabilities can be computed as: Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity – Total Owner’s Equity = 29,133,140.32 – 28,405,999.64 = 727,140.68  \n – Owner’s Equity = 28,405,999.64  \n• Ratio = 727,140.68 / 28,405,999.64 ≈ 0.03\n\nThus, the solution in the specified JSON format is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.85\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-23.96\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-23.96\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.51\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\"\n  }\n}",
