Since Accounts Payable is 0.00 and Taxes Payable is 727,140.68, the Total Liabilities (End_amount) = 727,140.68.\n\nStep 2: Use the formula for the Debt to Asset Ratio.\n  Debt to Asset Ratio = (Total Liabilities) / (Total Assets)\n\nStep 3: Substitute the values.\n  Debt to Asset Ratio = 727,140.68 / 29,133,140.32 ≈ 0.02498\n\nStep 4: Round the ratio to two decimal places.\n  0.02498 rounded to two decimals is 0.02.\n\nThus, the Debt to Asset Ratio as of the end of the reporting period is 0.02.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.02\"}\n}",
