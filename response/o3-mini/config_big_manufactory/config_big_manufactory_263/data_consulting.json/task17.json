In this case, under “Total Current Liabilities” we have only \"Taxes Payable\" which is 727,140.68.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement, the “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities” is –17,417,367.15.\n\nThus, the calculation becomes:\n\n  Ratio = (–17,417,367.15) / (727,140.68)\n\nPerforming the division:\n\n  Ratio ≈ –23.95\n\nThe resulting Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately –23.95.\n\nNow, the answer in the requested format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-23.95'} }",
