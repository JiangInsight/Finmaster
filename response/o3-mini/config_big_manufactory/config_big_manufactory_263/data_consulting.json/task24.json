Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n• From the balance sheet we have:\n  Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 727140.68  \n  Total Assets = 29133140.32  \n• The Debt to Asset Ratio is given by:\n  Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets  \n  = 727140.68 / 29133140.32  \n  ≈ 0.02498  \nRounded to two decimal places, this becomes 0.02.\n\nStep 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n• From the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is –17417367.15.  \n• From the income statement, the Net Profit is 405999.64.  \n• The ratio is calculated as:\n  Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Net Profit  \n  = (–17417367.15) / 405999.64  \n  ≈ –42.93\n\nThus, the final ratios are:\n\n{\n  \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.02\",\n  \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-42.93\"\n}\n\nNow, presenting the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.02\", \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-42.93\"}}",
