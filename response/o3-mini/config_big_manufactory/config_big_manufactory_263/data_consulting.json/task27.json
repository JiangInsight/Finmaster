Calculate Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio  \n• From the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is –17,417,367.15.  \n• From the income statement, the Net Profit is 405,999.64.  \n• Ratio = (Operating Cash Flow) / (Net Profit) = –17,417,367.15 / 405,999.64 ≈ –42.91  \n\nStep 2. Calculate the Current Assets Turnover Ratio  \n• “Total Current Assets” at the beginning is 20,000,000.00 and at the end is 21,224,639.20.  \n• The average current assets = (20,000,000.00 + 21,224,639.20) / 2 = 20,612,319.60  \n• From the income statement, the Main Business Revenue (or Total Revenue) is 14,542,813.42.  \n• Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Current Assets = 14,542,813.42 / 20,612,319.60 ≈ 0.71  \n\nStep 3. Calculate the Quick Ratio  \n• Quick Assets include Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, and Accounts Receivable.  \n – Cash on Hand: 1,482,632.85  \n – Bank Deposits: 1,100,000.00  \n – Interest Receivable: 20,559.00  \n – Accounts Receivable: 10,221,447.35  \n  Total Quick Assets = 1,482,632.85 + 1,100,000.00 + 20,559.00 + 10,221,447.35 = 12,824,639.20  \n• Current Liabilities (end) are given by Taxes Payable = 727,140.68 (Accounts Payable is 0).  \n• Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities = 12,824,639.20 / 727,140.68 ≈ 17.63  \n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-42.91\",\n    \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.71\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"17.63\"\n  }\n}",
