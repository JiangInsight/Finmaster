Free Cash Flow (FCF):\n   • FCF is computed as the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities plus the Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\n   • In the cash flow statement, we have:\n     - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -17417367.15\n     - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -0.00\n   • Therefore, FCF = -17417367.15 + (-0.00) = -17417367.15\n\n2. Return on Assets (ROA):\n   • ROA = (Net Profit) / (Average Total Assets) × 100%\n   • The balance sheet shows Total Assets at the beginning as 28000000.00 and at the end as 29133140.32.\n   • Average Total Assets = (28000000.00 + 29133140.32) / 2 = 28566570.16\n   • Net Profit from the income statement is 405999.64.\n   • ROA = 405999.64 / 28566570.16 ≈ 0.01422, or 1.42%\n\n3. Return on Equity (ROE):\n   • ROE = (Net Profit) / (Average Owner's Equity) × 100%\n   • From the balance sheet, Owner's Equity at the beginning is 28000000.00 and the end is 28405999.64.\n   • Average Owner's Equity = (28000000.00 + 28405999.64) / 2 = 28202999.82\n   • ROE = 405999.64 / 28202999.82 ≈ 0.01440, or 1.44%\n\n4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:\n   • This ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Net Profit)\n   • Using the values: -17417367.15 / 405999.64 ≈ -42.90\n\n5. Net Profit Margin:\n   • Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit) / (Total Revenue) × 100%\n   • Total Revenue is 14542813.42 and Net Profit is 405999.64.\n   • Net Profit Margin = 405999.64 / 14542813.42 ≈ 0.02792, or 2.79%\n\n6. Gross Profit Margin:\n   • Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit) / (Total Revenue) × 100%\n   • Gross Profit from the income statement is 4142813.42 and Total Revenue is 14542813.42.\n   • Gross Profit Margin = 4142813.42 / 14542813.42 ≈ 0.2849, or 28.49%\n\nThe final values are compiled in the provided JSON answer.",
