Adding the 11 Sale transactions (with after‑tax amounts 989756.10, 1309177.98, 1414539.51, 635389.30, 625309.19, 2000763.81, 1050173.65, 2090503.90, 1423021.24, 1015275.41 and 1261762.65) produced a Total Revenue (and hence Main Business Revenue) of 13,815,672.74.\n\n2. • For each sale the “cost_amount” was given. Summing these values (800000.0, 1000000.0, 1000000.0, 500000.0, 500000.0, 1500000.0, 800000.0, 1500000.0, 1000000.0, 800000.0 and 1000000.0) yielded 10,400,000.00. We set the Cost of Goods Sold and Total Cost equal to this sum.\n\n3. • Gross Profit is computed as Total Revenue − COGS = 13,815,672.74 – 10,400,000.00 = 3,415,672.74.\n\n4. • Next we summed the expense items by category from the “Expense” transactions:\n  – Administrative Expenses (selected from all rows with type “Administrative Expenses”) summed to 1,360,718.89.\n  – Selling Expenses (those “Expense” rows identified as “Sales Expenses”) summed to 858,414.65.\n  – Depreciation expenses were taken from the two Depreciation rows (4,5750.46 and 45,748.42) totaling 91,498.88.\n  – Financial Expenses (all “Financial Expenses” rows) totaled 540,843.88.\n Adding these four groups gives Total Expenses = 1,360,718.89 + 858,414.65 + 91,498.88 + 540,843.88 = 2,851,476.30.\n\n5. • “Interest Receivables” entries (taken as interest income) were summed over all such transactions (both in January and February) to yield 18,885.80.\n\n6. • Profit Before Tax is then Gross Profit plus Interest Income minus Total Expenses:\n  3,415,672.74 + 18,885.80 − 2,851,476.30 = 583,082.24.\n\n7. • With an assumed tax rate of roughly 30% on the profit, Tax Expense becomes 583,082.24 × 0.30 = 174,924.67 and therefore Net Profit is 583,082.24 – 174,924.67 = 408,157.57.\n\nThe final income statement computed is reflected in the JSON answer above.",
