                        "content": "We can “build” the net profit by summarizing all the income items (the realized “profit” values on the sales plus any interest‐income items from “Interest Receivables”) and then subtracting all the expenses (which here include the “Expense” items – Administrative, Sales and Financial, and also the “Depreciation” transactions).\n\nBelow is one reasoning procedure (note that the numbers are long and we round to two decimals at the end):\n\n1. (Sale profit “income”) – Look at every row whose “type” begins with “Sale”:\n  • Sale20240104001: profit = 241848.53  \n  • Sale20240108002: profit = 378082.08  \n  • Sale20240109003: profit = 488988.96  \n  • Sale20240113005: profit = 168830.84  \n  • Sale20240114007: profit = 158220.20  \n  • Sale20240115009: profit = 606067.17  \n  • Sale20240118012: profit = 305445.95  \n  • Sale20240119014: profit = 700530.42  \n  • Sale20240120015: profit = 497917.10  \n  • Sale20240122018: profit = 268710.96  \n  • Sale20240125020: profit = 328171.21  \n\n Summing these gives approximately:\n  241848.53 + 378082.08 = 619930.61  \n  + 488988.96 = 1,108,919.57  \n  + 168830.84 = 1,277,750.41  \n  + 158220.20 = 1,435,970.61  \n  + 606067.17 = 2,042,037.78  \n  + 305445.95 = 2,347,483.73  \n  + 700530.42 = 3,048,014.15  \n  + 497917.10 = 3,545,931.25  \n  + 268710.96 = 3,814,642.21  \n  + 328171.21 = 4,142,813.42\n\n2. (Interest income) – Sum every “Interest Receivables” row (all amounts are positive – even if “Unpaid” they are income):\n  The many interest rows (from dates 2024‑01‑01 through 2024‑02‑05) add up to about 20,140.70.\n\n3. Therefore the overall “income” is \n  4,142,813.42 (sales profit) + 20,140.70 (interest income) \n  ≈ 4,162,954.12\n\n4. (Expenses) – Now add up every “Expense” (of type Administrative Expenses, Sales Expenses, Financial Expenses) plus the depreciation rows. (There are many such transactions; when you add up all the provided “Expense…” and “Depreciation…” amounts in the table the total comes to about 3,004,898.43.)\n\n5. Finally the net profit is the overall income minus the total expenses:\n  Net Profit = 4,162,954.12 – 3,004,898.43 ≈ 1,158,055.69\n\nWhen we round to two decimals the final net profit is approximately 1,158,055.69.\n\nThus, in the required json format, we answer as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"1158055.69\"} }\n```",
