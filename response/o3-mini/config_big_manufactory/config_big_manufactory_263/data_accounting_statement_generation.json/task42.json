                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” the tax–related cash‐flow item by “reconstructing” the net change in tax liability that the business has accumulated during the period. (In simple terms, the tax that “sticks” on the balance–sheet is the tax that has been accrued on sales even if you haven’t yet collected the cash from your customers.) \n\nOne common method is to “separate” the sales into those for which the revenue (and thus its related tax) has been collected (“paid”) and those still “unpaid.” For the purposes of a cash–flow “reconciliation” the change in tax payable is the tax on sales that remains “uncollected” (thus “adding” to the liability) minus any tax that has been collected in cash (which would in effect “reduce” the outstanding liability).\n\nIn our new problem the sale transactions (each with a “tax_amount” value) are as follows. (All amounts here are in the same monetary unit.)\n\n1. Sale20240104001\n  • tax_amount = 52,092.43                               (Unpaid)\n2. Sale20240108002\n  • tax_amount = 68,904.10                               (Unpaid)\n3. Sale20240109003\n  • tax_amount = 74,449.45                               (Paid)\n4. Sale20240113005\n  • tax_amount = 33,441.54                               (Unpaid)\n5. Sale20240114007\n  • tax_amount = 32,911.01                               (Paid)\n6. Sale20240115009\n  • tax_amount = 105,303.36                              (Unpaid)\n7. Sale20240118012\n  • tax_amount = 55,272.30                               (Paid)\n8. Sale20240119014\n  • tax_amount = 110,026.52                              (Unpaid)\n9. Sale20240120015\n  • tax_amount = 74,895.86                               (Unpaid)\n10. Sale20240122018\n  • tax_amount = 53,435.55                               (Paid)\n11. Sale20240125020\n  • tax_amount = 66,408.56                               (Unpaid)\n\nNow, group the “unpaid” sales and “paid” sales separately:\n\n• Unpaid–sales tax =\n 52,092.43 + 68,904.10 + 33,441.54 + 105,303.36 + 110,026.52 + 74,895.86 + 66,408.56 \n        = 511,072.37\n\n• Paid–sales tax =\n 74,449.45 + 32,911.01 + 55,272.30 + 53,435.55 \n        = 215,068.31\n\nIntuitively, money that has been collected means the tax (although already “accrued”) has been “flushed out” of the liability account (the related cash inflow “reduces” tax‐payable), while tax on sales that are still “unpaid” remains as an accrued (or “pending”) liability.\n\nThus the change in (final) tax payable is computed as the “unpaid‐side” minus the “paid–side”: \n\n  Final tax liability = 511,072.37 – 215,068.31 = 296,004.06\n\nThat is, during the period the net “increase” in tax payable is 296,004.06.\n\nSo the final answer is provided as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"296004.06\"} }\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNote:\n• In practice the “tax payable” line item in the cash flow statement comes from reconciling the tax expense from the income statement with actual tax payments made during the period. Here, based solely on the sale transactions data provided (and using the working assumption that only the tax amounts attached to the sale records affect the liability) the net accrual is taken as the difference between tax “owing” (from unpaid sales) and tax “cash‐collected” (from sales paid in cash).\n• Different businesses may have additional adjustment items (for instance, tax recoveries on purchases, prepayments, or tax refunds) but these are not shown in the raw transactions.\n\nThis completes the step–by–step solution.",
