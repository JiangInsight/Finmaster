                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” the changes to the balance sheet using the following idea. In the sample problem the “Initial” entries were exactly the opening “balance” of owner’s equity plus any contributed‐capital (here the “Initial20231231001” rows) and they were summed:\n\n  Sample initial value = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.\n\nThen after all operating activities (sales, expenses, depreciation, etc.) – the net “profit” (the “profit” field provided in each Sale row) added to the opening balance yielded the “end” value. In the sample the sum of the given Sale transaction “profit” amounts came out to an increase of 216409.49 so that\n\n  Final Liabilities and Owners Equity = 13,000,000 + 216,409.49 = 13,216,409.49.\n\nIn our new table the method is the same.\n\nStep 1. Find the Initial total:\n• There are three “Initial20231231001” transactions:\n – Cash deposit = 5,000,000.0 \n – Bank deposit = 15,000,000.0 \n – Fixed Assets = 8,000,000.0 \nSumming these gives:\n  5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 28,000,000.0\n\nThus the “Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value” is 28,000,000.00.\n\nStep 2. Compute the net change – that is, the aggregated “profit” reported on the sale transactions. (In our table the sale transactions already show a “profit” value that is, roughly, the excess of sale proceeds (net of any cost of sales, taxes etc.) over the cost‐of‐goods sold so that these profits “flow” into owners equity.)\n\nThe “Sale” transactions in our new table (with their “profit” field) are:\n\n1. Sale20240104001 – profit = 241848.53  \n2. Sale20240108002 – profit = 378082.08  \n3. Sale20240109003 – profit = 488988.96  \n4. Sale20240113005 – profit = 168830.84  \n5. Sale20240114007 – profit = 158220.20  \n6. Sale20240115009 – profit = 606067.17  \n7. Sale20240118012 – profit = 305445.95  \n8. Sale20240119014 – profit = 700530.42  \n9. Sale20240120015 – profit = 497917.10  \n10. Sale20240122018 – profit = 268710.96  \n11. Sale20240125020 – profit = 328171.21  \n\nNow we add these step‐by‐step:\n\n• After (1) & (2): 241848.53 + 378082.08 = 619930.61  \n• Adding (3): 619930.61 + 488988.96 = 1,108,919.57  \n• Adding (4): 1,108,919.57 + 168830.84 = 1,277,750.41  \n• Adding (5): 1,277,750.41 + 158220.20 = 1,435,970.61  \n• Adding (6): 1,435,970.61 + 606067.17 = 2,042,037.78  \n• Adding (7): 2,042,037.78 + 305445.95 = 2,347,483.73  \n• Adding (8): 2,347,483.73 + 700530.42 = 3,048,014.15  \n• Adding (9): 3,048,014.15 + 497917.10 = 3,545,931.25  \n• Adding (10): 3,545,931.25 + 268710.96 = 3,814,642.21  \n• Adding (11): 3,814,642.21 + 328171.21 = 4,142,813.42  \n\nThus the total net profit from “Sale” transactions is 4,142,813.42.\n\nStep 3. The ending “Total Liabilities and Owners Equity” is then computed as\n\n  Initial value + net profit = 28,000,000.00 + 4,142,813.42 = 32,142,813.42\n\nThus we obtain:\n\n• Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value: 28,000,000.00  \n• Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value: 32,142,813.42\n\nThe answer in the requested JSON format is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\", \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"32142813.42\"}}",
