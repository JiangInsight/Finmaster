                        "content": "We must “filter‐in” only the transactions that affect the “operating” cash flows. In our case the “cash” flows from day‐to‐day (usually sales and expense payments) are used while any “initial” cash deposits and any purchases of fixed assets (or “heavy equipment” in these transactions) are not operating but investing/financing activities. (Also note that noncash “depreciation” is ignored and interest receivable transactions that are “unpaid” do not “touch” cash.)  \n\nLet’s explain briefly one way to “simulate” the calculation:\n\n• First, determine the “cash inflows” from operating activities. In our data only a few sale transactions actually “received cash” (their receive method is “Cash” rather than “Account Receviable”). In our list these are:  \n – Sale20240109003 – a sale for Heavy Equipment C – received by Cash = 1,488,988.96  \n – Sale20240114007 – a sale for Heavy Equipment A – received by Cash = 658,220.20  \n – Sale20240118012 – a sale for Heavy Equipment B – received by Cash = 1,105,445.95  \n – Sale20240122018 – a sale for Heavy Equipment B – received by Cash = 1,068,710.96  \n\nTheir sum is approximately:  \n 1,488,988.96 + 658,220.20 = 2,147,209.16  \n 2,147,209.16 + 1,105,445.95 = 3,252,655.11  \n 3,252,655.11 + 1,068,710.96 = 4,321,366.07  \n\n• Next, include “cash outflows” from operating activities. These are mostly the expense payments (for Administrative, Sales, Financial expenses) that were paid in cash. (Any “Purchase” transaction where the item purchased is heavy equipment instead is an investing cash‐flow and is not included in operating activities.)  \n\nWhen you go one‐by‐one through the expense-type transactions – for example:  \n 52785.32, 41401.58, 95031.07, 76088.96, 90880.30, 97411.96, 13378.52, 88037.49, 65994.77, 24809.95, 71239.16, 49859.26, 55861.96, 79745.09, 49981.50, 18888.02, 85574.08, … etc. (there are many) – their total “paid in cash” adds up to about 2,924,733.22.  \n\n• Finally, the net operating cash flow is the “cash received from operating activities” minus the “cash paid for operating expenses”:  \n  Net = 4,321,366.07 – 2,924,733.22 ≈ 1,396,632.85  \n\nFor the sake of this exercise the (approximate) final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"1396632.85\"\n  }\n}\n\nNote that in an actual analysis each transaction must be classified carefully. Here we took only the “cash in” from sales paid by cash (and not “initial” or “purchase” items for fixed assets) and subtracted the “cash out” flow from all (administrative, sales and financial) expense payments made by cash.",
