In our table only the transactions whose type is “Sale” contribute to COGS. (Other transactions such as Purchases, Expenses, Depreciations, etc. do not directly affect COGS.) \n\nLet’s list the sale rows along with the cost_amount value:\n\n1. id Sale20240104001: cost_amount = 800000.0  \n2. id Sale20240108002: cost_amount = 1000000.0  \n3. id Sale20240109003: cost_amount = 1000000.0  \n4. id Sale20240113005: cost_amount = 500000.0  \n5. id Sale20240114007: cost_amount = 500000.0  \n6. id Sale20240115009: cost_amount = 1500000.0  \n7. id Sale20240118012: cost_amount = 800000.0  \n8. id Sale20240119014: cost_amount = 1500000.0  \n9. id Sale20240120015: cost_amount = 1000000.0  \n10. id Sale20240122018: cost_amount = 800000.0  \n11. id Sale20240125020: cost_amount = 1000000.0  \n\nNow, we add them:\n\n• 800,000  \n+ 1,000,000 = 1,800,000  \n+ 1,000,000 = 2,800,000  \n+   500,000 = 3,300,000  \n+   500,000 = 3,800,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 5,300,000  \n+   800,000 = 6,100,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 7,600,000  \n+ 1,000,000 = 8,600,000  \n+   800,000 = 9,400,000  \n+ 1,000,000 = 10,400,000  \n\nThus, the final COGS is 10,400,000.00\n\nWe now present our answer in the required JSON format.\n\nFinal answer:\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"10400000.00\"\n  }\n}",
