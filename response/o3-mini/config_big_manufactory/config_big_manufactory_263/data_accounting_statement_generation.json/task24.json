                        "content": "We “build” the income statement “cost” item by looking only at the sale transactions whose records include a value in the “cost_amount” column. In the given table only the rows with type = Sale produce a cost (that is the cost of the sold equipment). (In our earlier example the final “Total Cost” was simply the sum of the cost_amount values in all the sale rows.) \n\nLet’s list the sale rows with their cost_amounts from the table:\n\n1. Row id Sale20240104001 has cost_amount = 800000.0  \n2. Row id Sale20240108002 has cost_amount = 1000000.0  \n3. Row id Sale20240109003 has cost_amount = 1000000.0  \n4. Row id Sale20240113005 has cost_amount = 500000.0  \n5. Row id Sale20240114007 has cost_amount = 500000.0  \n6. Row id Sale20240115009 has cost_amount = 1500000.0  \n7. Row id Sale20240118012 has cost_amount = 800000.0  \n8. Row id Sale20240119014 has cost_amount = 1500000.0  \n9. Row id Sale20240120015 has cost_amount = 1000000.0  \n10. Row id Sale20240122018 has cost_amount = 800000.0  \n11. Row id Sale20240125020 has cost_amount = 1000000.0  \n\nNow we add them together step‐by‐step:\n\n• 800000.0 + 1000000.0 = 1800000.0  \n• 1800000.0 + 1000000.0 = 2800000.0  \n• 2800000.0 + 500000.0 = 3300000.0  \n• 3300000.0 + 500000.0 = 3800000.0  \n• 3800000.0 + 1500000.0 = 5300000.0  \n• 5300000.0 + 800000.0 = 6100000.0  \n• 6100000.0 + 1500000.0 = 7600000.0  \n• 7600000.0 + 1000000.0 = 8600000.0  \n• 8600000.0 + 800000.0 = 9400000.0  \n• 9400000.0 + 1000000.0 = 10400000.0  \n\nThus the total cost that will appear on the income statement is 10,400,000.00.\n\nFollowing the required JSON output format, our answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Total Cost\": \"10400000.00\"}\n}",
