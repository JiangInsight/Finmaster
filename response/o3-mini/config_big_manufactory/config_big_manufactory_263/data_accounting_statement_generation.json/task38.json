                        "content": "We must “build” the balance‐sheet “accounts receivable” as a net sum of all amounts not actually received as cash. (In other words, only those sales or “interest receivable” items that were recorded “on account” add to the receivables.) In our problem the only transactions that affect the “Accounts Receivable” balance are Sale records where the “receive_method” is “Account Receviable” plus the separate Interest Receivable entries (each one “Unpaid”). (Transactions whose “receive_method” is “Cash” are not credited to accounts receivable.) \n\nLet’s go step‐by‐step.\n\nStep 1. – Identify the “Sale” entries with “Account Receviable” as the receive method. For each such sale we use the “after_tax_amount” (the net sale value recorded) as the amount that “increases AR.”\n\nIn the data the Sale entries with “Account Receviable” are (with their after‐tax amount):\n\n• Sale20240104001: after_tax_amount = 989756.10  \n• Sale20240108002: after_tax_amount = 1309177.98  \n• Sale20240113005: after_tax_amount = 635389.30  \n• Sale20240115009: after_tax_amount = 2000763.81  \n• Sale20240119014: after_tax_amount = 2090503.90  \n• Sale20240120015: after_tax_amount = 1423021.24  \n• Sale20240125020: after_tax_amount = 1261762.65  \n• Sale20240128053: after_tax_amount = 107742.44  \n\nLet’s sum these:\n  989756.10 + 1309177.98 = 2298934.08  \n  2298934.08 + 635389.30 = 2934323.38  \n  2934323.38 + 2000763.81 = 4935087.19  \n  4935087.19 + 2090503.90 = 7025591.09  \n  7025591.09 + 1423021.24 = 8448612.33  \n  8448612.33 + 1261762.65 = 9710374.98  \n  9710374.98 + 107742.44 = 9818117.42  \n\nSo the total “credit‐sale” component is about 9,818,117.42.\n\nStep 2. – Identify the “Interest Receivables” entries (their “type” is Interest Receivables and they are “Unpaid”). Each such transaction (which appears separately on the balance sheet) is added. In the data the following interest transactions appear with the amounts (all “Unpaid”):\n\n  1335.00, 1335.00, 1246.00, 1246.00, 1246.00, 1068.00, 1068.00, 801.00, 729.80, 729.80, 729.80, 729.80, 729.80, 729.80, 685.30, 418.30, 418.30, 418.30, 418.30, 418.30, 418.30, 418.30, 418.30, 418.30, 418.30, 275.90, 275.90, 275.90, 275.90, 186.90, 186.90\n\nThen (from the next period) also the smaller ones:  \n  97.90, 97.90, 97.90, 97.90, 97.90\n\nA careful summation of these gives a total “Interest Receivable” amount of about 20,559.00.\n\nStep 3. – The overall “Accounts Receivable” balance is the sum of the “credit‐sales” plus the “interest receivable”:  \n  9,818,117.42 + 20,559.00 = 9,838,676.42\n\nSince in the cash flow statement an increase in a noncash asset is a use of cash the “(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable” is shown with a minus sign. (Remember, if the receivables have “increased” during the period, that represents a use of cash.)\n\nThus the final line item is:  \n  “Increase in Accounts Receivable” = –9,838,676.42\n\nWe now present the answer in the requested format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-9838676.42\"\n  }\n}\n\n(Notice that numbers have been rounded to two decimals.)",
