                        "content": "We must “close‐the books” by “collecting” all revenue and expense effects. In our simplified example we assume that:\n \n• The three “Initial…” transactions set up the firm’s balance‐sheet “capital” (and in our simplified case the beginning retained earnings is 0.00).\n \n• The only “income” items are the profits we “see” on the Sales rows plus the “Interest receivables” which are income.\n \n• All “Expense” rows (including “Administrative Expenses”, “Sales Expenses”, “Financial Expenses” as well as “Depreciation” entries) are “charged against profit.”\n \nThen the “net income” for the period is calculated as:\n \n  net income = (sum of sale profits + sum of interest receivable amounts) – (sum of all expenses and depreciation).\n \nFor our problem the transactions (ignoring purchases, transfers and the “Initial…” lines which are balance‐sheet investments) are as follows:\n \n1. Sales “profit” amounts (taken from the “profit” column of each Sale row):\n  241848.53 + 378082.08 + 488988.96 + 168830.84 + 158220.20 + 606067.17 + 305445.95 + 700530.42 + 497917.10 + 268710.96 + 328171.21\n  ≈ 4,142,813.42\n \n2. “Interest Receivables” amounts (each “Interest” row–each positive and “unpaid” interest is income):\n  1335.0 + 1335.0 + 1246.0 + 1246.0 + 1246.0 + 1068.0 + 1068.0 + 801.0 + 729.8 + 729.8 +\n    729.8 + 729.8 + 729.8 + 729.8 + 685.3 + 418.3 + 418.3 + 418.3 + 418.3 + 418.3 +\n    418.3 + 418.3 + 418.3 + 418.3 + 275.9 + 275.9 + 275.9 + 275.9 + 186.9 + 186.9 +\n    97.9 + 97.9 + 97.9 + 97.9 + 97.9\n  ≈ 20,140.70\n \n3. The “Expense” lines (which include Administrative, Sales, Financial expenses, and also the Depreciation rows) add up to about:\n  ≈ 3,028,232.10\n \nThen the net income is\n \n  4,142,813.42 + 20,140.70 – 3,028,232.10 ≈ 1,134,722.02\n \nSince we assume that no prior retained earnings existed (the “Initial Retained Earnings” is 0.00) the ending retained earnings is the net income “rolled‐forward” into the balance sheet.\n \nThus, the final answer is:\n \n  Retained Earnings Initial Value = 0.00 \n  Retained Earnings End Value = 1134722.02\n \nWe now present the solution in the required JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {'Retained Earnings Initial Value': '0.00', 'Retained Earnings End Value': '1134722.02'}}",
