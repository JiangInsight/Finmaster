In these records the only “initial” transactions are the ones with the id \"Initial20231231001\". In this problem there are three such rows:\n\n• Cash deposit – amount: 5,000,000  \n• Bank deposit – amount: 15,000,000  \n• Fixed Assets – amount: 8,000,000  \n\nTheir sum is the initial capital injected (the “paid‐in capital”):\n\n  5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 28,000,000\n\nThere are no subsequent transactions that indicate any further contributions to the paid‐in capital. (Other transactions such as purchases, expenses, sales, depreciation, interest etc. affect other balance sheet or income statement accounts but not the capital provided by owners.) \n\nThus, the initial paid‐in capital – and therefore the ending paid‐in capital – remain at 28,000,000.00\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '28000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '28000000.00'} }",
