To do that we go through the transaction rows and add up only the rows whose “type” field is exactly “Administrative Expenses.” (Other expense types like “Sales Expenses”, “Financial Expenses”, etc. are not included.) \n\nBelow are the rows we must include (showing their amounts):\n\n1. Expense20240101001 – Administrative Expenses: 52,785.32  \n2. Expense20240101001 – Administrative Expenses: 41,401.58  \n3. Expense20240104001 – Administrative Expenses: 90,880.30  \n4.
