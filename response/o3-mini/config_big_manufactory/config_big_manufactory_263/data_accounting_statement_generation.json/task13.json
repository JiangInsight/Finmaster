                        "content": "We have to determine the “taxes payable” as a balance‐sheet item. In our case the balance sheet “taxes payable” entry is normally generated by the sales transactions for which a tax is collected (despite any “input tax” on purchases, none are reported on purchase rows here). In other words, beginning with an “Initial” balance of zero, the ending taxes payable is the cumulative tax from sales during the period.\n\nStep 1. Identify the sales transactions (rows whose “type” begins with “Sale”). In our data the following sale rows give a nonblank tax amount (the “tax_amount” field):\n\n • Sale20240104001  tax_amount = 52092.43  \n • Sale20240108002  tax_amount = 68904.10  \n • Sale20240109003  tax_amount = 74449.45  \n • Sale20240113005  tax_amount = 33441.54  \n • Sale20240114007  tax_amount = 32911.01  \n • Sale20240115009  tax_amount = 105303.36  \n • Sale20240118012  tax_amount = 55272.30  \n • Sale20240119014  tax_amount = 110026.52  \n • Sale20240120015  tax_amount = 74895.86  \n • Sale20240122018  tax_amount = 53435.55  \n • Sale20240125020  tax_amount = 66408.56\n\nStep 2. Sum the tax amounts:\n 52092.43  \n+ 68904.10  = 120996.53  \n+ 74449.45  = 195445.98  \n+ 33441.54  = 228887.52  \n+ 32911.01  = 261798.53  \n+105303.36  = 367101.89  \n+ 55272.30  = 422374.19  \n+110026.52  = 532400.71  \n+ 74895.86  = 607296.57  \n+ 53435.55  = 660732.12  \n+ 66408.56  = 727140.68\n\nStep 3. Notice that there is no “initial” tax payable provided in the “Initial…” rows (which are simply bank/cash deposits or asset additions) so we assume that the tax payable at the beginning of the period is zero.\n\nThus, the final “taxes payable” – that is, the liability that has accumulated during the period – is 727140.68.\n\nThe answer is then provided in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"727140.68\"\n  }\n}",
