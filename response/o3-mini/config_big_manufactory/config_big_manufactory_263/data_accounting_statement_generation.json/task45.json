                        "content": "We must first decide which transactions are “investing” cash flows. In our context the investing section includes cash flow events related to long‑term (fixed) asset transactions such as purchases of heavy equipment or fixed assets and sales (or disposals) of those items. (Other operating or financing cash flows are not used here.) \n\nIn the given data the following rows relate to investing activities:\n\nA. “Initial” fixed asset entry:\n • id = Initial20231231001, type = Fixed Assets, amount = 8,000,000.0  \n  (This represents the purchase or recording of fixed assets; as cash “spent”, it produces a cash outflow of 8,000,000.0.)\n\nB. Purchases of heavy equipment (each represents a cash outflow):\n 1. Purchase20231231001 – Heavy Equipment B for 800,000.0  \n 2. Purchase20231231002 – Heavy Equipment A for 500,000.0  \n 3. Purchase20231231003 – Heavy Equipment A (2 units at 500,000.0 each) for 1,000,000.0  \n 4. Purchase20231231004 – Heavy Equipment B for 800,000.0  \n 5. Purchase20231231005 – Heavy Equipment C (2 units at 1,000,000.0 each) for 2,000,000.0  \n 6. Purchase20231231006 – Heavy Equipment D (2 units at 1,500,000.0 each) for 3,000,000.0  \n 7. Purchase20231231007 – Heavy Equipment B for 800,000.0  \n 8. Purchase20231231008 – Heavy Equipment C (2 units at 1,000,000.0 each) for 2,000,000.0  \n 9. Purchase20231231009 – Heavy Equipment A for 500,000.0  \n 10. Purchase20231231010 – Heavy Equipment D (2 units at 1,500,000.0 each) for 3,000,000.0  \n 11.

Purchase20231231013 – Heavy Equipment C (2 units) for 2,000,000.0  \n\nSumming these “outflow” amounts we get:\n Fixed Assets initial: 8,000,000.0  \n + 800,000.0  \n + 500,000.0  \n + 1,000,000.0  \n + 800,000.0  \n + 2,000,000.0  \n + 3,000,000.0  \n + 800,000.0  \n + 2,000,000.0  \n + 500,000.0  \n + 3,000,000.0  \n + 800,000.0  \n + 1,600,000.0  \n + 2,000,000.0  \n = 26,800,000.0  \n\nC. Sales of heavy equipment (each is a cash inflow):\n 1. Sale20240104001 – Heavy Equipment B for 1,041,848.53  \n 2. Sale20240108002 – Heavy Equipment C for 1,378,082.08  \n 3. Sale20240109003 – Heavy Equipment C for 1,488,988.96  \n 4. Sale20240113005 – Heavy Equipment A for 668,830.84  \n 5. Sale20240114007 – Heavy Equipment A for 658,220.20  \n 6. Sale20240115009 – Heavy Equipment D for 2,106,067.17  \n 7. Sale20240118012 – Heavy Equipment B for 1,105,445.95  \n 8. Sale20240119014 – Heavy Equipment D for 2,200,530.42  \n 9. Sale20240120015 – Heavy Equipment C for 1,497,917.10  \n 10. Sale20240122018 – Heavy Equipment B for 1,068,710.96  \n 11. Sale20240125020 – Heavy Equipment C for 1,328,171.21  \n\nNow summing these “inflow” amounts:\n 1,041,848.53  \n + 1,378,082.08 = 2,419,930.61  \n + 1,488,988.96 = 3,908,919.57  \n + 668,830.84 = 4,577,750.41  \n + 658,220.20 = 5,235,970.61  \n + 2,106,067.17 = 7,342,037.78  \n + 1,105,445.95 = 8,447,483.73  \n + 2,200,530.42 = 10,648,014.15  \n + 1,497,917.10 = 12,145,931.25  \n + 1,068,710.96 = 13,214,642.21  \n + 1,328,171.21 = 14,542,813.42  \n\nThus total cash inflows from investing = 14,542,813.42\n\nD. Finally, the net cash flow from investing activities is calculated as:\n Net Investing CF = Total Inflows – Total Outflows  \n  = 14,542,813.42 – 26,800,000.0  \n  ≈ –12,257,186.58\n\nSo the final answer is a net cash outflow from investing activities of about –12,257,186.58.\n\nNow we present the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-12257186.58\"\n  }\n}",
