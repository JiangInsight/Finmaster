                        "content": "We first need to “build up” the book‐value of the non­‑current (fixed) assets. In our case the “non‑current assets” start with the opening “Fixed Assets” balance taken from the “Initial” row and then we add new asset purchases and subtract any disposals as well as “using up” part of the assets through depreciation.\n\nLet’s explain step‐by‐step:\n\n1. Initial balance (from the “Initial20231231001” row with type Fixed Assets):  \n  = 8,000,000\n\n2. Additions from purchases (only those whose purchased item is “Heavy Equipment …” are assumed to be part of the fixed assets). The “Purchase” rows giving an asset value are:\n\n  • Purchase20231231001: 800,000  \n  • Purchase20231231002: 500,000  \n  • Purchase20231231003: 1,000,000                             (note: 1 unit × 500,000 each ×2)  \n  • Purchase20231231004: 800,000  \n  • Purchase20231231005: 2,000,000  \n  • Purchase20231231006: 3,000,000  \n  • Purchase20231231007: 800,000  \n  • Purchase20231231008: 2,000,000  \n  • Purchase20231231009: 500,000  \n  • Purchase20231231010: 3,000,000  \n  • Purchase20231231011: 800,000  \n  • Purchase20231231012: 1,600,000  \n  • Purchase20231231013: 2,000,000\n\n  If we sum these up:  \n  800,000 + 500,000 = 1,300,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 2,300,000  \n  + 800,000 = 3,100,000  \n  + 2,000,000 = 5,100,000  \n  + 3,000,000 = 8,100,000  \n  + 800,000 = 8,900,000  \n  + 2,000,000 = 10,900,000  \n  + 500,000 = 11,400,000  \n  + 3,000,000 = 14,400,000  \n  + 800,000 = 15,200,000  \n  + 1,600,000 = 16,800,000  \n  + 2,000,000 = 18,800,000\n\n  So, total additions = 18,800,000.\n\n3. Disposals (when the company sells an asset, the asset’s cost is removed from the books). The “Sale” transactions for heavy equipment (notice the product names are “Heavy Equipment …”) and the “cost_amount” tells us the value removed. We find:\n\n  • Sale20240104001 (Heavy Equipment B): 800,000  \n  • Sale20240108002 (Heavy Equipment C): 1,000,000  \n  • Sale20240109003 (Heavy Equipment C): 1,000,000  \n  • Sale20240113005 (Heavy Equipment A): 500,000  \n  • Sale20240114007 (Heavy Equipment A): 500,000  \n  • Sale20240115009 (Heavy Equipment D): 1,500,000  \n  • Sale20240118012 (Heavy Equipment B): 800,000  \n  • Sale20240119014 (Heavy Equipment D): 1,500,000  \n  • Sale20240120015 (Heavy Equipment C): 1,000,000  \n  • Sale20240122018 (Heavy Equipment B): 800,000  \n  • Sale20240125020 (Heavy Equipment C): 1,000,000\n\n  Let’s add these numbers:  \n  800,000 + 1,000,000 = 1,800,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 2,800,000  \n  + 500,000 = 3,300,000  \n  + 500,000 = 3,800,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 5,300,000  \n  + 800,000 = 6,100,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 7,600,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 8,600,000  \n  + 800,000 = 9,400,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 10,400,000\n\n  So, total disposals = 10,400,000.\n\n4. Depreciation (which “uses up” some of the asset’s book value):\n  There are two depreciation transactions:  \n  • Depreciation20240101001: 45,750.46  \n  • Depreciation20240201002: 45,748.42  \n  Total depreciation = 45,750.46 + 45,748.42 = 91,498.88\n\n5. Now, calculating the final (end–of–period) book value of non­‑current assets:\n\n  Gross asset value before depreciation = Initial + Additions – Disposals  \n  = 8,000,000 + 18,800,000 – 10,400,000  \n  = 26,800,000 – 10,400,000  \n  = 16,400,000\n\n  Then, subtract depreciation:  \n  Final asset value = 16,400,000 – 91,498.88  \n  ≈ 16,308,501.12\n\nThus, the answers (formatted to two decimals) are:\n\n  Total Non‑current Assets Initial Value = 8,000,000.00  \n  Total Non‑current Assets End Value ≈ 16,308,501.12\n\nBelow is the answer in the required json format:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"16308501.12\"}}",
