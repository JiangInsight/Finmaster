In contrast, “liabilities” in our system come from amounts not yet paid for a purchase (that is, items that are “Unpaid” and/or run to “Account Payable”) so that the company still owes money. In the sample data a couple of purchases were recorded as Unpaid and showed up as liabilities.\n\nLooking over the “Purchase” transactions in the provided problem data, every Purchase (and every other transaction that might normally affect a liability account such as related “Expense” entries) is marked “Paid”. (Also note that “Interest Receivables” even if not yet received are “receivables” – that is, assets – not liabilities.) Therefore no liabilities have been “accrued” by the end of the reporting period.\n\nIt follows that at the beginning none of the opening entries were liabilities and at period‑end no unpaid purchase or similar liability adds up.\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"0.00\"\n  }\n}",
