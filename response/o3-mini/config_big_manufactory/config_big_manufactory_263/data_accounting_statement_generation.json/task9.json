                        "content": "We can “build” the net‐fixed assets balance by starting with the initial posting (the “Initial” entry of type Fixed Assets) then adding all purchases of heavy equipment (which represent additions to fixed assets), then subtracting the cost amounts when heavy equipment were sold and finally “deducting” the depreciation amounts recorded later. (Note that operating expenses, interest and cash/bank transfers do not “hit” the fixed assets account.)\n\nStep 1. Initial Fixed Assets\n\n• The “Initial20231231001” row with type “Fixed Assets” shows an amount of 8,000,000.00. That is our starting (or “initial”) fixed‐assets value.\n\nStep 2. Additions via Purchase transactions\n\nThere are several purchase entries that record heavy equipment. In our table these are the rows with id beginning with “Purchase2023123100X” that have products such as “Heavy Equipment A”, “Heavy Equipment B”, “Heavy Equipment C” or “Heavy Equipment D.” Their “amount” values are as follows:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001: 800,000.00  \n2. Purchase20231231002: 500,000.00  \n3. Purchase20231231003: 1,000,000.00  \n4. Purchase20231231004: 800,000.00  \n5. Purchase20231231005: 2,000,000.00  \n6. Purchase20231231006: 3,000,000.00  \n7. Purchase20231231007: 800,000.00  \n8. Purchase20231231008: 2,000,000.00  \n9. Purchase20231231009: 500,000.00  \n10. Purchase20231231010: 3,000,000.00  \n11. Purchase20231231011: 800,000.00  \n12. Purchase20231231012: 1,600,000.00  \n13. Purchase20231231013: 2,000,000.00\n\nIf you add these together:\n  800,000 + 500,000 = 1,300,000  \n  1,300,000 + 1,000,000 = 2,300,000  \n  2,300,000 + 800,000 = 3,100,000  \n  3,100,000 + 2,000,000 = 5,100,000  \n  5,100,000 + 3,000,000 = 8,100,000  \n  8,100,000 + 800,000 = 8,900,000  \n  8,900,000 + 2,000,000 = 10,900,000  \n  10,900,000 + 500,000 = 11,400,000  \n  11,400,000 + 3,000,000 = 14,400,000  \n  14,400,000 + 800,000 = 15,200,000  \n  15,200,000 + 1,600,000 = 16,800,000  \n  16,800,000 + 2,000,000 = 18,800,000  \n\nThus total additions = 18,800,000.00\n\nStep 3. Compute the “pre‐disposal” total\n\nInitial (8,000,000.00) plus additions (18,800,000.00) gives:\n  8,000,000.00 + 18,800,000.00 = 26,800,000.00\n\nStep 4. Subtract the cost of fixed asset disposals (sales)\n\nWhenever fixed assets are sold the “cost amount” recorded in the sale transaction (the value of the asset disposed) is removed from the fixed assets balance. In our table the sale entries involving heavy equipment (which belong on fixed assets) report a “cost amount” as follows:\n\n• Sale20240104001 – cost: 800,000.00  \n• Sale20240108002 – cost: 1,000,000.00  \n• Sale20240109003 – cost: 1,000,000.00  \n• Sale20240113005 – cost: 500,000.00  \n• Sale20240114007 – cost: 500,000.00  \n• Sale20240115009 – cost: 1,500,000.00  \n• Sale20240118012 – cost: 800,000.00  \n• Sale20240119014 – cost: 1,500,000.00  \n• Sale20240120015 – cost: 1,000,000.00  \n• Sale20240122018 – cost: 800,000.00  \n• Sale20240125020 – cost: 1,000,000.00\n\nSumming these:\n  800,000 + 1,000,000 = 1,800,000  \n  1,800,000 + 1,000,000 = 2,800,000  \n  2,800,000 + 500,000 = 3,300,000  \n  3,300,000 + 500,000 = 3,800,000  \n  3,800,000 + 1,500,000 = 5,300,000  \n  5,300,000 + 800,000 = 6,100,000  \n  6,100,000 + 1,500,000 = 7,600,000  \n  7,600,000 + 1,000,000 = 8,600,000  \n  8,600,000 + 800,000 = 9,400,000  \n  9,400,000 + 1,000,000 = 10,400,000  \n\nThus total cost disposals = 10,400,000.00\n\nSubtracting these from our “pre‐disposal” total:\n  26,800,000.00 – 10,400,000.00 = 16,400,000.00\n\nStep 5. Subtract Depreciation\n\nThere are two depreciation entries:\n• Depreciation20240101001 = 45,750.46  \n• Depreciation20240201002 = 45,748.42\n\nTotal depreciation = 45,750.46 + 45,748.42  \n  = 91,498.88 (approximately)\n\nSubtracting:\n  16,400,000.00 – 91,498.88 = 16,308,501.12\n\nThus the final (end–of–period) fixed assets net value is about 16,308,501.12.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n• Fixed assets net Initial Value: 8,000,000.00  \n• Fixed assets net End Value: 16,308,501.12\n\nNow we present the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\nFinal JSON output is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"fixed assets net Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"fixed assets net End Value\": \"16308501.12\"}}",
