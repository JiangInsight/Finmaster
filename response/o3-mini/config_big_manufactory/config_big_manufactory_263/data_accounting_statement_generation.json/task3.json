                        "content": "We must “build the inventory” from the transactions that add to (or reduce from) stock. In our case only the “Purchase” and “Sale” transactions affect inventory (the “Initial” rows are opening balances for cash, bank and fixed‐assets, not inventory).\n\nStep 1. Identify all purchase transactions that are buying items for stock. In our file these are the rows whose id starts with “Purchase…”. (We assume that every purchase is for a “Heavy Equipment” item that will later be sold.) Their “amount” field gives the total cost for that purchase. The purchases are:\n\n • Purchase20231231001: Amount = 800,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231002: Amount = 500,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231003: Amount = 1,000,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231004: Amount = 800,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231005: Amount = 2,000,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231006: Amount = 3,000,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231007: Amount = 800,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231008: Amount = 2,000,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231009: Amount = 500,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231010: Amount = 3,000,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231011: Amount = 800,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231012: Amount = 1,600,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231013: Amount = 2,000,000.00  \n\nSumming these amounts:\n\n  800,000 + 500,000 = 1,300,000  \n  1,300,000 + 1,000,000 = 2,300,000  \n  2,300,000 + 800,000 = 3,100,000  \n  3,100,000 + 2,000,000 = 5,100,000  \n  5,100,000 + 3,000,000 = 8,100,000  \n  8,100,000 + 800,000 = 8,900,000  \n  8,900,000 + 2,000,000 = 10,900,000  \n  10,900,000 + 500,000 = 11,400,000  \n  11,400,000 + 3,000,000 = 14,400,000  \n  14,400,000 + 800,000 = 15,200,000  \n  15,200,000 + 1,600,000 = 16,800,000  \n  16,800,000 + 2,000,000 = 18,800,000  \n\nSo the total “purchased cost” is 18,800,000.\n\nStep 2. Now, identify the “Sale” transactions that remove inventory. (We assume that when an item is sold its “cost_amount” tells how much inventory cost leaves inventory.) The Sale rows (id starting with “Sale…”) that affect inventory are:\n\n • Sale20240104001: cost_amount = 800,000.00   (Product: Heavy Equipment B)  \n • Sale20240108002: cost_amount = 1,000,000.00  (Product: Heavy Equipment C)  \n • Sale20240109003: cost_amount = 1,000,000.00  (Product: Heavy Equipment C)  \n • Sale20240113005: cost_amount = 500,000.00   (Product: Heavy Equipment A)  \n • Sale20240114007: cost_amount = 500,000.00   (Product: Heavy Equipment A)  \n • Sale20240115009: cost_amount = 1,500,000.00  (Product: Heavy Equipment D)  \n • Sale20240118012: cost_amount = 800,000.00   (Product: Heavy Equipment B)  \n • Sale20240119014: cost_amount = 1,500,000.00  (Product: Heavy Equipment D)  \n • Sale20240120015: cost_amount = 1,000,000.00  (Product: Heavy Equipment C)  \n • Sale20240122018: cost_amount = 800,000.00   (Product: Heavy Equipment B)  \n • Sale20240125020: cost_amount = 1,000,000.00  (Product: Heavy Equipment C)\n\nSumming these cost reductions:\n\n  800,000 + 1,000,000 = 1,800,000  \n  1,800,000 + 1,000,000 = 2,800,000  \n  2,800,000 + 500,000 = 3,300,000  \n  3,300,000 + 500,000 = 3,800,000  \n  3,800,000 + 1,500,000 = 5,300,000  \n  5,300,000 + 800,000 = 6,100,000  \n  6,100,000 + 1,500,000 = 7,600,000  \n  7,600,000 + 1,000,000 = 8,600,000  \n  8,600,000 + 800,000 = 9,400,000  \n  9,400,000 + 1,000,000 = 10,400,000  \n\nSo total cost of items sold (“cost of inventory out”) is 10,400,000.\n\nStep 3. Assume that no beginning inventory existed (the “Initial” rows did not include items held as inventory). Therefore, the “Inventory Initial Value” is 0.00.\n\nStep 4. The “Inventory End Value” is the total purchased cost minus the cost of goods sold:\n  18,800,000 – 10,400,000 = 8,400,000.\n\nThus the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Inventory End Value\": \"8400000.00\"\n  }\n}",
