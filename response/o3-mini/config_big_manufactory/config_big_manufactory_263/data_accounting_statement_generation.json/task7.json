                        "content": "We must “build” the fixed assets‐balance item using the “initial” balance (which comes from the “Fixed Assets” row in the initial entries) and then “adjust” for any later fixed asset purchases (additions) and fixed asset disposals (reductions).\n\nBelow is our step‐by‐step reasoning:\n\n1. The “Initial20231231001” entries include one “Fixed Assets” row with an amount of 8,000,000.0. This is the opening value of fixed assets.\n\n2. Later in the period there are “Purchase” rows for items that are fixed assets (Heavy Equipment items are assumed to be fixed assets). We list those (using the “Purchase20231231…” ids):\n • Purchase20231231001 (“Heavy Equipment B”): +800,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231002 (“Heavy Equipment A”): +500,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231003 (“Heavy Equipment A”): +1,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231004 (“Heavy Equipment B”): +800,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231005 (“Heavy Equipment C”): +2,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231006 (“Heavy Equipment D”): +3,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231007 (“Heavy Equipment B”): +800,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231008 (“Heavy Equipment C”): +2,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231009 (“Heavy Equipment A”): +500,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231010 (“Heavy Equipment D”): +3,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231011 (“Heavy Equipment B”): +800,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231012 (“Heavy Equipment B”): +1,600,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231013 (“Heavy Equipment C”): +2,000,000.0\n\n We sum these additional purchases:\n  800,000 + 500,000 = 1,300,000  \n  1,300,000 + 1,000,000 = 2,300,000  \n  2,300,000 + 800,000 = 3,100,000  \n  3,100,000 + 2,000,000 = 5,100,000  \n  5,100,000 + 3,000,000 = 8,100,000  \n  8,100,000 + 800,000 = 8,900,000  \n  8,900,000 + 2,000,000 = 10,900,000  \n  10,900,000 + 500,000 = 11,400,000  \n  11,400,000 + 3,000,000 = 14,400,000  \n  14,400,000 + 800,000 = 15,200,000  \n  15,200,000 + 1,600,000 = 16,800,000  \n  16,800,000 + 2,000,000 = 18,800,000\n\n Then add the opening fixed assets of 8,000,000 gives a “gross” fixed assets amount of:\n  8,000,000 + 18,800,000 = 26,800,000\n\n3. Some “Sale” rows represent disposal of fixed assets. (When a fixed asset is sold the “cost_amount” in that sale reflects the original cost of that asset.) The sale transactions whose “cost_amount” we use are:\n\n • Sale20240104001 – sale of Heavy Equipment B with cost_amount = 800,000.0  \n • Sale20240108002 – sale of Heavy Equipment C with cost_amount = 1,000,000.0  \n • Sale20240109003 – sale of Heavy Equipment C with cost_amount = 1,000,000.0  \n • Sale20240113005 – sale of Heavy Equipment A with cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n • Sale20240114007 – sale of Heavy Equipment A with cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n • Sale20240115009 – sale of Heavy Equipment D with cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n • Sale20240118012 – sale of Heavy Equipment B with cost_amount = 800,000.0  \n • Sale20240119014 – sale of Heavy Equipment D with cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n • Sale20240120015 – sale of Heavy Equipment C with cost_amount = 1,000,000.0  \n • Sale20240122018 – sale of Heavy Equipment B with cost_amount = 800,000.0  \n • Sale20240125020 – sale of Heavy Equipment C with cost_amount = 1,000,000.0\n\n Now sum these disposals:\n  800,000 + 1,000,000 = 1,800,000  \n  1,800,000 + 1,000,000 = 2,800,000  \n  2,800,000 + 500,000 = 3,300,000  \n  3,300,000 + 500,000 = 3,800,000  \n  3,800,000 + 1,500,000 = 5,300,000  \n  5,300,000 + 800,000 = 6,100,000  \n  6,100,000 + 1,500,000 = 7,600,000  \n  7,600,000 + 1,000,000 = 8,600,000  \n  8,600,000 + 800,000 = 9,400,000  \n  9,400,000 + 1,000,000 = 10,400,000\n\n4. Finally, the “end” (or closing) fixed assets balance is computed by taking the gross balance (initial + purchases) and subtracting the disposals:\n  26,800,000 – 10,400,000 = 16,400,000\n\nSo the results are:\n Fixed Assets Initial Value = 8,000,000.00  \n Fixed Assets End Value = 16,400,000.00\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"16400000.00\"} }\n```",
