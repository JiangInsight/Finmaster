In the sample data provided sometimes a purchase was recorded with a “payment_method” such as “Account Payable” or with a status “Unpaid” so that the purchase amount adds to the accounts payable account. \n\nFor the new problem the three “initial” entries are simply depositor and fixed asset items and do not create liabilities. Then we review each “Purchase…” transaction. In this set all purchase transactions have the payment/receipt_status of “Paid” (and their payment_method is “Cash”, “Bank Transfer”, etc.) – none of them are recorded as “Unpaid” or with a payment method that would otherwise be used to record a liability.\n\nThus, before any operating transactions the accounts payable balance is zero, and since no purchase was left unpaid the ending accounts payable also remains zero.\n\nThe answer is therefore:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"0.00\"\n  }\n}",
