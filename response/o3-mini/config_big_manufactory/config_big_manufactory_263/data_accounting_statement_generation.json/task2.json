                        "content": "We start with the initial balances. In the “Initial20231231001” rows the only two that affect liquid funds are the Cash deposit and the Bank deposit. (The “Fixed Assets” entry is a non‐cash item.) In our case the Bank deposit initial value is given as\n\n  15000000.0\n\nThat is our opening bank deposit balance.\n\nNext we inspect the other transactions to see which ones affect funds held in the bank account. (Only those transactions that are “Paid” with a payment method of “Bank Transfer” (or “Bank to cash transfer,” which takes money OUT of the bank account) change the bank account.) In our file the following rows affect the bank deposit:\n\n1. Transactions paid by “Bank Transfer” (outflows from bank):\n • Purchase20231231003: –1,000,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231005: –2,000,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231006: –3,000,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231007: –800,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231009: –500,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231010: –3,000,000.0 \n • Purchase20231231012: –1,600,000.0 \n   Subtotal = 1,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 3,000,000 + 800,000 + 500,000 + 3,000,000 + 1,600,000 = 11,900,000.0\n\n2. “Bank to cash transfer” transactions:\n • Transfer20240130001: –1,000,000.0 \n • Transfer20240201001: –1,000,000.0 \n   Subtotal = 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 2,000,000.0\n\nNo transactions are sending cash into the bank (for example through “Cash to bank transfer”). Therefore, the total reduction in bank deposit is\n\n  11,900,000.0 + 2,000,000.0 = 13,900,000.0\n\nFinally, subtracting this reduction from the opening bank deposit we get the Bank deposit ending balance:\n\n  15,000,000.0 – 13,900,000.0 = 1,100,000.0\n\nSo the solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"15000000.00\",\n    \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"1100000.00\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis completes the answer step‐by‐step.",
