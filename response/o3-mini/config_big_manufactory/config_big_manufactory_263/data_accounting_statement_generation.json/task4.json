                        "content": "We have no beginning‐of‐period balance recorded for receivables so we assume that before any “credit sale” or “interest receivable” activity the balance was 0. Then, we go through the transactions and “pick out” those where the amount will eventually be “owed” by a customer – that is, the sales that were not “paid in cash” but were “Account Receivable” plus any “Interest Receivables” (which in our books are recorded with a “receive_method” of either “Account Receivable” (in sales) or “Interest receviable” for interest items).\n\nBelow we explain (step–by–step) how we computed the final balance:\n\n1. The three “Initial20231231001” entries (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) do not involve any receivable (the customers owe nothing from these). Hence the beginning AR balance is assumed 0.00.\n\n2. Then we scan our transactions. In our table there are two “classes” of receivable transactions:\n\n  a. Sales that were not paid immediately – the “Sale” transactions where the “receive_method” is recorded as “Account Receivable”. (For example, the “Sale20240104001” row has amount 1,041,848.53 and “Account Receivable” as its receive method.)  \n  b. Interest items from “Interest Receivables” (which usually have “Unpaid” in the status and the “receive_method” appears as “Interest receviable”).\n\n3. By going through the table we “pick” and sum all such amounts. (For ease of explanation, we list them by row; note that only “Sale” rows with credit treatment are added and we ignore any sale paid in cash.)\n\n  – The credited Sales (with “Account Receivable”) are:\n   • Sale20240104001: 1,041,848.53  \n   • Sale20240108002: 1,378,082.08  \n   • Sale20240113005: 668,830.84  \n   • Sale20240115009: 2,106,067.17  \n   • Sale20240119014: 2,200,530.42  \n   • Sale20240120015: 1,497,917.10  \n   • Sale20240125020: 1,328,171.21  \n  Sum of all “credit” sales = 10,221,447.35\n\n  – Next, all “Interest Receivable” items (with “Unpaid” and with the “Interest receviable” marker) add up as follows:\n   • Interest20240101001: 1,335.00  \n   • Interest20240102002: 1,335.00  \n   • Interest20240103003: 1,246.00  \n   • Interest20240104004: 1,246.00  \n   • Interest20240105005: 1,246.00  \n   • Interest20240106006: 1,068.00  \n   • Interest20240107007: 1,068.00  \n   • Interest20240108008: 801.00  \n   • Interest20240109009: 729.80  \n   • Interest20240110010: 729.80  \n   • Interest20240111011: 729.80  \n   • Interest20240112012: 729.80  \n   • Interest20240113013: 729.80  \n   • Interest20240114014: 729.80  \n   • Interest20240115015: 685.30  \n   • Interest20240116016: 418.30  \n   • Interest20240117017: 418.30  \n   • Interest20240118018: 418.30  \n   • Interest20240119019: 418.30  \n   • Interest20240120020: 418.30  \n   • Interest20240121021: 418.30  \n   • Interest20240122022: 418.30  \n   • Interest20240123023: 418.30  \n   • Interest20240124024: 418.30  \n   • Interest20240125025: 418.30  \n   • Interest20240126026: 275.90  \n   • Interest20240127027: 275.90  \n   • Interest20240128028: 275.90  \n   • Interest20240129029: 275.90  \n   • Interest20240130030: 186.90  \n   • Interest20240131031: 186.90  \n   • Interest20240201032: 97.90  \n   • Interest20240202033: 97.90  \n   • Interest20240203034: 97.90  \n   • Interest20240204035: 97.90  \n   • Interest20240205036: 97.90  \n  The sum of all these interest items comes to about 20,559.00.\n\n4. Finally, the “ending” Accounts Receivable balance is simply the sum of the amounts from (a) and (b):\n  10,221,447.35 (from credit sales) + 20,559.00 (from interest receivables) = 10,242,006.35\n\nThus, the beginning AR was 0.00 and at the end of the period the AR balance is 10,242,006.35.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"10242006.35\"} }",
