                        "content": "We must “simulate” a cash‐flow analysis by going through every transaction that has a direct effect on cash and cash equivalents. (Transfers that move money from “cash” to “bank” (or vice–versa) are not “net increases” but simply shifts between accounts; non–cash transactions, depreciation, unpaid items, or “account receivable” sales are ignored.) In our working we do the following:\n\n1. The “Initial” rows give the opening “cash deposit” and “bank deposit” but they do not count as “flows” during the period so they are used only to “build” the opening balance and not part of the net increase calculation. (Also a line like “Fixed Assets – Initial” is not a change in cash.)\n \n2. Then, for every later transaction we include only those marked as “Paid” from a cash (or bank transfer) payment method. For example, a Purchase paid “Cash” or “Bank Transfer” subtracts that amount from cash; expenses paid in cash subtract their amount; and a “Sale” that is actually paid with cash adds to cash. (Meanwhile, transactions recorded as “Unpaid” or those whose “payment method” is “Account Receivable” do not affect cash now.)\n\n3. By stepping through the list one by one we summed the following (numbers below are in monetary units):\n\n• Outflows (cash “–” operations):\n  Purchase20231231001: –800000.00 \n  Expense20240101001 (Administrative): –52785.32 \n  Expense20240101001 (Administrative): –41401.58 \n  Purchase20231231002: –500000.00 \n  Expense20240102001 (Financial): –95031.07 \n  Purchase20231231003: –1000000.00 \n  Purchase20231231004: –800000.00 \n  Expense20240103001 (Financial): –76088.96 \n  Expense20240104001 (Administrative): –90880.30 \n  Expense20240105001 (Administrative): –97411.96 \n  Purchase20231231005: –2000000.00 \n  Expense20240106001 (Administrative): –13378.52 \n  Expense20240107001 (Administrative): –88037.49 \n  Expense20240107001 (Administrative): –65994.77 \n  Purchase20231231006: –3000000.00 \n  Expense20240108001 (Administrative): –24809.95 \n  Purchase20231231007: –800000.00 \n  Expense20240109001 (Administrative): –71239.16 \n  Purchase20231231008: –2000000.00 \n  Expense20240110001 (Sales): –49859.26 \n  Expense20240111001 (Administrative): –55861.96 \n  Expense20240112001 (Administrative): –79745.09 \n  Expense20240113001 (Administrative): –49981.50 \n  Expense20240113001 (Sales): –18888.02 \n  Expense20240114001 (Sales): –85574.08 \n  Purchase20231231009: –500000.00 \n  Expense20240115001 (Administrative): –46342.51 \n  Purchase20231231010: –3000000.00 \n  Expense20240116001 (Administrative): –65029.92 \n  Expense20240116001 (Sales): –27874.13 \n  Expense20240117001 (Sales): –93224.76 \n  Expense20240118001 (Sales): –53910.46 \n  Expense20240119001 (Financial): –18332.13 \n  Expense20240120001 (Sales): –25333.67 \n  Expense20240121001 (Administrative): –90283.20 \n  Expense20240121001 (Sales): –72579.27 \n  Expense20240122001 (Administrative): –18733.38 \n  Expense20240123001 (Administrative): –13318.53 \n  Expense20240123001 (Sales): –85331.02 \n  Expense20240124001 (Administrative): –95847.49 \n  Expense20240124001 (Administrative): –40274.43 \n  Expense20240125001 (Administrative): –21473.78 \n  Expense20240125001 (Sales): –37217.30 \n  Purchase20231231012: –1600000.00 \n  Expense20240126001 (Administrative): –64584.16 \n  Expense20240126001 (Financial): –75582.46 \n  Expense20240127001 (Financial): –78160.43 \n  Expense20240127001 (Sales): –98414.82 \n  Expense20240128001 (Sales): –55250.84 \n  Expense20240129001 (Sales): –30839.26 \n  Purchase20231231013: –2000000.00 \n  Expense20240130001 (Financial): –69587.16 \n  Expense20240131001 (Administrative): –63215.67 \n  Expense20240131001 (Financial): –77099.29 \n  Expense20240201001 (Administrative): –74316.36 \n  Expense20240202001 (Sales): –60831.61 \n  Expense20240202001 (Financial): –39264.18 \n  Expense20240203001 (Administrative): –63621.12 \n  Expense20240203001 (Sales): –86695.40 \n  Expense20240204001 (Sales): –81361.47 \n  Expense20240205001 (Administrative): –27803.69 \n  Expense20240205001 (Financial): –30030.33 \n\n When adding all these cash “out”flows we obtain a total outflow on the order of –21,738,733.22.\n\n• Inflows (cash “+” operations):\n  Sale20240109003 (Sale, Paid in Cash): +1488988.96 \n  Sale20240114007 (Sale, Paid in Cash): +658220.20 \n  Sale20240118012 (Sale, Paid in Cash): +1105445.95 \n  Sale20240122018 (Sale, Paid in Cash): +1068710.96 \n  (Other Sale transactions are “Unpaid” and so do not immediately affect cash.)\n\nWhen we add these the total inflow is about +4,321,366.07.\n\n4. Finally, the net cash effect (net increase in cash and cash equivalents) is:\n\n  Net Increase = Total Inflows + Total Outflows \n            = 4,321,366.07 – 21,738,733.22 \n            ≈ –17,417,367.15\n\n(Any “Bank to cash” or “Cash to bank” transfers are simply shifts between forms of cash and do not change the overall cash and cash equivalents.)\n\nThus, the final net increase is negative –about –17,417,367.15, meaning that during the period the cash and cash equivalents decreased by roughly 17.42 million.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"-17417367.15\"} }\n```",
