                        "content": "We can “build” a cash‐flow statement by “back–solving” from the many individual “journal” entries. (In practice one would compare the sales/inventory/expense/interest entries with their “accrual” changes; here we show one plausible set of numbers based on the sample assumptions below.) \n\nLet’s explain one possible “reasoning” summary:\n\n• The “initial” entries show that cash came in as a cash deposit (5 000 000) and a bank deposit (15 000 000). (The “fixed assets” entry of 8 000 000 – though recorded initially – is recorded as a capital “investment” rather than cash available.) Thus we take the “beginning balance” of cash (and cash equivalents) to be\n  5 000 000 + 15 000 000 = 20 000 000.\n\n• Many “Purchase” entries (with a “Paid” method) are made for heavy–equipment items. In a trading business the acquisition of inventory is reflected as a working–capital “use of cash.” Adding up all the “Purchase” amounts (one for Heavy Equipment B, one for Heavy Equipment A, etc.) one finds a total “inventory purchase” of 18 800 000. (In our treatment, this “increase in inventory” is a cash–use – so we record –18 800 000.)\n\n• The sales entries are “recorded” with both cash– and credit–sales. We assume that the “credit” (Account Receivable) items sum to 10 231 447.35 (approximately); that is an “increase in accounts receivable” which is a use of cash (–10 231 447.35).\n\n• The “Interest Receivables” (all recorded as “Unpaid”) add up to about 20 559.0 so that the working–capital effect is –20 559.0.\n\n• The many “Expense” entries (Administrative, Sales and Financial) have already been “netted” into the profit figure. In addition, non–cash “Depreciation” appears on two dates. They sum to \n  45 750.46 + 45 748.42 ≈ 91 498.88.\n\n• Finally, from the “Sale” entries we add up the “profit” (the difference between the sales amount and the cost amount) to “compute” a Net Profit. In our case the sum of the profit fields (from the 11 separate sale transactions) is about 4 142 813.42. (For example, one sale of Heavy Equipment B has a profit of 241 848.53; another sale of Heavy Equipment D has a profit of 700 530.42; etc.) \n\n• Firms normally also separately track changes in tax–payable. In our “solution” we sum the tax amounts recorded on the sold items (for example, 52 092.43 on one sale, 68 904.10 on another, etc.) to get a product change of +727 140.68. (That “increase” is recorded as a source of cash in the operating section.) \n\nThen we “adjust” the Net Profit as follows to “arrive” at an operating–cash flow:\n  Net Profit     + Depreciation\n  – Increase in Accounts Receivable\n  – Increase in Interest Receivable\n  – Increase in Inventory\n  + Increase in Accounts Payable (here none)\n  + Increase in Tax Payable \n≈ 4 142 813.42 + 91 498.88 – 10 231 447.35 – 20 559.00 – 18 800 000.00 + 0 + 727 140.68 \n  ≈ –18 693 131.37\n\nWe then “separate” out the investing section. In our “model” only the initial “Fixed Assets” (8 000 000) is shown in the investing part. (That is normally shown as a “cash outflow” for purchasing fixed assets.)\nSo the “Purchase of Fixed Assets” is 8 000 000 and the net cash flow from investing activities is –8 000 000.\n\nWhen we “sum” the net activities the overall net change in cash becomes:\n  Net Increase = (Operating CF) + (Investing CF) \n      ≈ (–18 693 131.37) + (– 8 000 000.00)\n      ≈ –26 693 131.37\n\nThen the “Ending Balance” is determined by adding the change to the beginning balance:\n  Ending Balance = 20 000 000 + (–26 693 131.37) \n      ≈ –6 693 131.37\n\nIt is not unusual in a heavily “credit‐mode” business for the cash balance to be negative at a given moment.\n\nOne acceptable answer (numbers rounded to two decimals) is to report:\n\n{\n  \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": \"-18693131.37\",\n  \"Net Profit\": \"4142813.42\",\n  \"Depreciation\": \"91498.88\",\n  \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-10231447.35\",\n  \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-20559.00\",\n  \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-18800000.00\",\n  \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"727140.68\",\n  \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-18693131.37\",\n  \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"8000000.00\",\n  \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-8000000.00\",\n  \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Beginning Balance\": \"20000000.00\",\n  \"Ending Balance\": \"-6693131.37\",\n  \"Net Increase\": \"-26693131.37\"\n}\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": \"-18693131.37\",\n  \"Net Profit\": \"4142813.42\",\n  \"Depreciation\": \"91498.88\",\n  \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-10231447.35\",\n  \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-20559.00\",\n  \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-18800000.00\",\n  \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"727140.68\",\n  \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-18693131.37\",\n  \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"8000000.00\",\n  \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-8000000.00\",\n  \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Beginning Balance\": \"20000000.00\",\n  \"Ending Balance\": \"-6693131.37\",\n  \"Net Increase\": \"-26693131.37\"\n}}\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: There are many possible “solutions” depending on the interpretation (for example, whether the heavy–equipment items are treated as inventory or fixed assets, and how one “allocates” the credit sales changes). The figures above represent one plausible solution based on the assumptions made.",
