                        "content": "We first note that “inventory” in the cash‐flow statement is often reported as the “change in inventory”–that is, the difference between the ending inventory (the cost of what is on hand at the end of the reporting period) and the beginning balance (often zero when no inventory existed at “Initial”). In our case only purchase and sale transactions (which “add” or “reduce” inventory) are relevant.\n\nStep‐by‐step we do the following:\n\n1. For every purchase transaction (with type “Purchase”) the “cost” added to the inventory is the (quantity × cost_per_unit). In our data the purchases are as follows:\n\n • Purchase20231231001 (P002, Heavy Equipment B): 1 × 800,000 = 800,000  \n • Purchase20231231002 (P001, Heavy Equipment A): 1 × 500,000 = 500,000  \n • Purchase20231231003 (P001, Heavy Equipment A): 2 × 500,000 = 1,000,000  \n • Purchase20231231004 (P002, Heavy Equipment B): 1 × 800,000 = 800,000  \n • Purchase20231231005 (P003, Heavy Equipment C): 2 × 1,000,000 = 2,000,000  \n • Purchase20231231006 (P004, Heavy Equipment D): 2 × 1,500,000 = 3,000,000  \n • Purchase20231231007 (P002, Heavy Equipment B): 1 × 800,000 = 800,000  \n • Purchase20231231008 (P003, Heavy Equipment C): 2 × 1,000,000 = 2,000,000  \n • Purchase20231231009 (P001, Heavy Equipment A): 1 × 500,000 = 500,000  \n • Purchase20231231010 (P004, Heavy Equipment D): 2 × 1,500,000 = 3,000,000  \n • Purchase20231231011 (P002, Heavy Equipment B): 1 × 800,000 = 800,000  \n • Purchase20231231012 (P002, Heavy Equipment B): 2 × 800,000 = 1,600,000  \n • Purchase20231231013 (P003, Heavy Equipment C): 2 × 1,000,000 = 2,000,000  \n\nNow we sum these by product and then overall:\n – For P001: 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 = 2,000,000  \n – For P002: 800,000 + 800,000 + 800,000 + 800,000 + 1,600,000 = 4,800,000  \n – For P003: 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 6,000,000  \n – For P004: 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 = 6,000,000  \n\nThe total cost added by purchases is:\n 2,000,000 + 4,800,000 + 6,000,000 + 6,000,000 = 18,800,000\n\n2. Next, the “Sale” transactions remove inventory (using the cost_amount field):\nThe sale transactions and their cost amounts are:\n\n • Sale20240104001 (P002): cost_amount = 800,000  \n • Sale20240108002 (P003): cost_amount = 1,000,000  \n • Sale20240109003 (P003): cost_amount = 1,000,000  \n • Sale20240113005 (P001): cost_amount = 500,000  \n • Sale20240114007 (P001): cost_amount = 500,000  \n • Sale20240115009 (P004): cost_amount = 1,500,000  \n • Sale20240118012 (P002): cost_amount = 800,000  \n • Sale20240119014 (P004): cost_amount = 1,500,000  \n • Sale20240120015 (P003): cost_amount = 1,000,000  \n • Sale20240122018 (P002): cost_amount = 800,000  \n • Sale20240125020 (P003): cost_amount = 1,000,000  \n\nNow, summing these by product:\n – P001: 500,000 + 500,000 = 1,000,000  \n – P002: 800,000 + 800,000 + 800,000 = 2,400,000  \n – P003: 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 4,000,000  \n – P004: 1,500,000 + 1,500,000 = 3,000,000  \n\nTotal cost “sold” = 1,000,000 + 2,400,000 + 4,000,000 + 3,000,000 = 10,400,000\n\n3. The ending inventory (in cost terms) is the difference:\n Ending inventory = Total Purchases – Total Sales  \n  = 18,800,000 – 10,400,000  \n  = 8,400,000\n\n4. If we assume there was no beginning inventory then the change (an increase) in inventory is 8,400,000. In cash‐flow working capital adjustments an increase in inventory is “a use of cash” and is normally shown as a negative number.\n\nThus, the final “(Increase) Decrease in Inventory” to be reported in the cash flow statement is –8,400,000.00\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-8400000.00\"\n  }\n}",
