                        "content": "We can think of the “owner’s equity” as being built in two steps. First, the “initial‐owners equity” is given by the “Initial” transactions (sometimes recorded as “capital” or “investments”) and then the “end‐owners equity” is calculated by adding (or subtracting) the “net income” that accumulates from operations over the period. (No drawings or owner withdrawals are recorded here.)\n\nIn our problem the “Initial” rows are these three transactions (all dated 2023‑12‑31):\n\n • Cash deposit:    5,000,000.00 \n • Bank deposit:    15,000,000.00 \n • Fixed Assets (investment): 8,000,000.00 \n\nThus the starting (initial) owners equity is\n\n  5,000,000.00 + 15,000,000.00 + 8,000,000.00 = 28,000,000.00\n\nThen the “operations” during 2024 (and the last day of 2023 for purchases, etc.) provide “profit” (after expenses) that will increase the owners’ equity. In many transactions the “Sale” rows already show a calculated “profit” (that is, the sale’s after–tax amount minus the cost of the item sold). In our problem the main “profit‐making” transactions are the following “Sale” records – note that similar “Interest Receivables” are taken as extra income; while expense items (e.g. Administrative, Financial, Sales Expenses and Depreciation items) lower profit. (Purchases and transfers are simply asset re‐allocations or asset acquisitions and do not alter the equity total.)\n\nA brief summary of how we proceed (all amounts are in currency units):\n\n1. Sum up the “profit” column from every “Sale” row.\n  We find (by adding the individual sales “profit” figures)\n   Sale20240104001 ≈ 241,848.53 \n   Sale20240108002 ≈ 378,082.08 \n   Sale20240109003 ≈ 488,988.96 \n   Sale20240113005 ≈ 168,830.84 \n   Sale20240114007 ≈ 158,220.20 \n   Sale20240115009 ≈ 606,067.17 \n   Sale20240118012 ≈ 305,445.95 \n   Sale20240119014 ≈ 700,530.42 \n   Sale20240120015 ≈ 497,917.10 \n   Sale20240122018 ≈ 268,710.96 \n   Sale20240125020 ≈ 328,171.21 \n  Their total is approximately 4,142,813.42\n\n2. Next, add the “Interest Receivables” (each a small positive income) from the many “Interest…” rows. Their total is about 20,140.70.\n\n3. Then, sum up the “expense‐type” transactions (all “Expense” and “Depreciation” rows) – these include Administrative, Sales, Financial expenses plus the depreciation items. Adding the many expense amounts gives a total expense of about 3,030,232.10.\n\nThus the net income (after subtracting expenses from total income) is approximately\n\n  (4,142,813.42 + 20,140.70) – 3,030,232.10 ≈ 1,132,722.02\n\nFinally, adding this net income to the initial owners equity gives the ending owners equity:\n\n  28,000,000.00 + 1,132,722.02 = 29,132,722.02\n\nWe note that asset–changing entries like “Purchase” or “Transfers” (or even “Depreciation,” which when recorded reduces profit) have been processed already in the profit computation and in the expense totals.\n\nThus, our answer is as follows:\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\", \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"29132722.02\"} }\n```\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the step‐by‐step calculation that leads to the final result.",
