                        "content": "We first need to calculate the following ratios with the given data:\n\n1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n • Formula: Main Business Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n • In our statements the beginning Accounts Receivable is 0 and the ending value is 12,792,007.89. Thus:  \n  Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 12,792,007.89) / 2 = 6,396,003.945  \n • Main Business Revenue = 20,318,450.67  \n • Ratio = 20,318,450.67 / 6,396,003.945 ≈ 3.18\n\n2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio (and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio)  \n • Both are defined here as the ratio of Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities.  \n • Operating Cash Flow = –18,924,462.44  \n • Current Liabilities (from Taxes Payable) = 1,015,922.54  \n • Ratio = –18,924,462.44 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ –18.63  \n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n • Formula: Main Business Revenue / Average Total Assets  \n • Total Assets at beginning = 28,000,000.00 and at end = 30,858,088.75.  \n  Average Total Assets = (28,000,000.00 + 30,858,088.75) / 2 = 29,429,044.375  \n • Ratio = 20,318,450.67 / 29,429,044.375 ≈ 0.69\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n • Formula: Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity  \n • In the balance sheet the only liabilities given are the current liabilities (Tax Payable) = 1,015,922.54  \n • Total Owner’s Equity = 29,842,166.21  \n • Ratio = 1,015,922.54 / 29,842,166.21 ≈ 0.03\n\nThus, our computed values are:\n\n{\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.18\",\n  \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-18.63\",\n  \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-18.63\",\n  \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.69\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\"\n}",
