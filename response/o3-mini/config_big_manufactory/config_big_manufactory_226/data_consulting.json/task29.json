Calculate Debt to Equity Ratio  \n• From the balance sheet, the only liability is from taxes payable (since accounts payable is 0).  \n Total Liabilities = 1,015,922.54  \n Total Owner's Equity = 29,842,166.21  \n• Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity = 1,015,922.54 / 29,842,166.21 ≈ 0.034 → Rounded to two decimals: 0.03  \n\nStep 2. Calculate Net Profit Margin  \n• From the income statement,  \n Net Profit = 1,842,166.21  \n Total Revenue = 20,318,450.67  \n• Net Profit Margin = Net Profit / Total Revenue = 1,842,166.21 / 20,318,450.67 ≈ 0.09066 = 9.07%  \n\nStep 3. Calculate Return on Assets (ROA)  \n• Total Assets from the balance sheet = 30,858,088.75  \n• ROA = Net Profit / Total Assets = 1,842,166.21 / 30,858,088.75 ≈ 0.05967 = 5.97%  \n\nStep 4. Calculate Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n• Accounts Receivable at the end is 12,792,007.89 and initial value is 0, so the average accounts receivable = (0 + 12,792,007.89) / 2 = 6,396,003.945  \n• Using Total Revenue as the numerator (assuming credit sales approximates revenue),  \n Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable = 20,318,450.67 / 6,396,003.945 ≈ 3.177 → Rounded to two decimals: 3.18  \n\nThus, the final solution is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"9.07%\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"5.97%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.18\"\n  }\n}",
