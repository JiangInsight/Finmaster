                        "content": "We begin by extracting the needed amounts from the three statements.\n\nStep 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio \n• From the Cash Flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is –18,924,462.44.\n• From the Income Statement, the Net Profit is 1,842,166.21.\n• Ratio = (Operating Cash Flow) / (Net Profit) = –18,924,462.44 / 1,842,166.21 ≈ –10.27\n\nStep 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio \n• For turnover ratios it is common to use revenue divided by average current assets.\n• From the Income Statement, Main Business Revenue is 20,318,450.67.\n• From the Balance Sheet, Total Current Assets are given as 20,000,000.00 initially and 20,314,894.50 at end.\n• Average Current Assets = (20,000,000.00 + 20,314,894.50) / 2 ≈ 20,157,447.25.\n• Ratio = Revenue / Average Current Assets = 20,318,450.67 / 20,157,447.25 ≈ 1.01\n\nStep 3. Quick Ratio \n• Quick Ratio is defined as (Current Assets – Inventory) / Current Liabilities.\n• From the Balance Sheet, Total Current Assets (end) is 20,314,894.50.\n• Inventory (end) is 9,100,000.00.\n• Thus “Quick Assets” = 20,314,894.50 – 9,100,000.00 = 11,214,894.50.\n• Current Liabilities (end): Accounts Payable is 0.00 and Taxes Payable is 1,015,922.54, so Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54.\n• Ratio = 11,214,894.50 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ 11.04\n\nThus, our calculated ratios are as follows.\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-10.27\",\n    \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"1.01\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"11.04\"\n  }\n}",
