                        "content": "We can solve this step‐by‐step by calculating each ratio using the numbers provided.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n  Definition = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities ÷ Total Current Liabilities  \n  From the cash flow statement:  \n   Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = –18,924,462.44  \n  From the balance sheet:  \n   Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54  \n  Thus,  \n   Operating Cash Flow Ratio = –18,924,462.44 ÷ 1,015,922.54 ≈ –18.63\n\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \n  Definition = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities ÷ Total Debt  \n  Here, “Total Debt” is taken as the liabilities (since no non-current liabilities are separately given); that is,  \n   Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54  \n  Thus,  \n   Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = –18,924,462.44 ÷ 1,015,922.54 ≈ –18.63\n\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio  \n  Definition = Cost of Goods Sold ÷ Average Inventory  \n  Average Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) ÷ 2  \n  From the balance sheet:  \n   Beginning Inventory = 0.00 and Ending Inventory = 9,100,000.00  \n   Average Inventory = (0 + 9,100,000) ÷ 2 = 4,550,000.00  \n  From the income statement:  \n   Cost of Goods Sold = 14,600,000.00  \n  Thus,  \n   Inventory Turnover Ratio = 14,600,000.00 ÷ 4,550,000.00 ≈ 3.21\n\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n  Definition = Total Debt ÷ Total Owner’s Equity  \n  Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54  \n  From the balance sheet:  \n   Total Owner’s Equity = 29,842,166.21  \n  Thus,  \n   Debt to Equity Ratio = 1,015,922.54 ÷ 29,842,166.21 ≈ 0.034 (≈0.03 when rounded)\n\n5. Quick Ratio  \n  Definition = (Current Assets – Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities  \n  From the balance sheet:  \n   Total Current Assets = 20,314,894.50  \n   Inventory = 9,100,000.00  \n   Quick Assets = 20,314,894.50 – 9,100,000.00 = 11,214,894.50  \n   Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54  \n  Thus,  \n   Quick Ratio = 11,214,894.50 ÷ 1,015,922.54 ≈ 11.04\n\n6. Current Ratio  \n  Definition = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities  \n  From the balance sheet:  \n   Current Assets = 20,314,894.50  \n   Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54  \n  Thus,  \n   Current Ratio = 20,314,894.50 ÷ 1,015,922.54 ≈ 20.00\n\nPresenting all the ratios in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-18.63\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-18.63\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"3.21\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"11.04\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"20.00\"\n  }\n}",
