In this case the only liability is:  \n  – Total Current Liabilities: 1,015,922.54  \n   • Owner’s Equity is provided as:  \n  – Total Owner's Equity: 29,842,166.21  \n   • Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity  \n  = 1,015,922.54 / 29,842,166.21  \n  ≈ 0.03406  \n   Rounding to two decimals, we get 0.03.\n\n2. Net Profit Margin  \n   • Net Profit from the income statement is: 1,842,166.21  \n   • Total Revenue is: 20,318,450.67  \n   • Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100  \n  = (1,842,166.21 / 20,318,450.67) × 100  \n  ≈ 9.065%  \n   Rounding to two decimals, we get 9.07%.\n\n3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n   • Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities from the cash flow statement is: -18,924,462.44  \n   • Total Current Liabilities is: 1,015,922.54  \n   • Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Current Liabilities)  \n  = -18,924,462.44 / 1,015,922.54  \n  ≈ -18.63\n\nThus, the final results in the required JSON format are:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"9.07%\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-18.63\"\n  }\n}",
