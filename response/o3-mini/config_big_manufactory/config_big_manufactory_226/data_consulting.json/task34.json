                        "content": "We start by extracting the key numbers from the three statements.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio and Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n • Operating Cash Flow (from the cash flow statement) = –18,924,462.44  \n • Total Current Liabilities (from the balance sheet) = 1,015,922.54  \n  Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n   = –18,924,462.44 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ –18.63  \n\n(In the sample the “Operating Cash Flow Ratio” was identical to the “Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.”)\n\n2. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n • Here “Debt” is taken as the Total Current Liabilities (no non‐current debt items are shown): 1,015,922.54  \n • Total Owner’s Equity (from the balance sheet) = 29,842,166.21  \n  Debt to Equity = 1,015,922.54 / 29,842,166.21 ≈ 0.0341  \n  Rounding we report this as 0.03\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n • Total Revenue from the income statement = 20,318,450.67  \n • Total Assets (end) from the balance sheet = 30,858,088.75  \n  Total Asset Turnover = 20,318,450.67 / 30,858,088.75 ≈ 0.6584  \n  Rounded to 0.66\n\n4. Quick Ratio  \n • Quick Assets = Current Assets – Inventory  \n  = 20,314,894.50 – 9,100,000.00 = 11,214,894.50  \n • Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities  \n  = 11,214,894.50 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ 11.04\n\n5. Return on Equity (ROE)  \n • Net Profit from the income statement = 1,842,166.21  \n • Total Owner’s Equity = 29,842,166.21  \n  ROE = (Net Profit / Total Equity) × 100  \n  = (1,842,166.21 / 29,842,166.21) × 100 ≈ 6.17%\n\n6. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n • From the balance sheet: beginning Accounts Receivable = 0; ending Accounts Receivable = 12,792,007.89  \n  Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 12,792,007.89) / 2 = 6,396,003.945  \n • Accounts Receivable Turnover = Total Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n  = 20,318,450.67 / 6,396,003.945 ≈ 3.177  \n  Rounded to 3.18\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-18.63\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.66\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"11.04\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-18.63\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"6.17%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.18\"\n  }\n}",
