For capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares (from the Balance Sheet) look up the line \"Paid-in Capital\". Its End_amount is 28000000.00.\n2. For profit (or loss) before deducting tax expense (from the Income Statement) look up the \"Profit Before Tax\" line. Its Amount is 2858088.75.\n3. For the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit (from the Cash Flow Statement) look up the line \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\". Its Amount is 0.00.\n\nAccording to the instruction to group by statement order (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, then Cash Flow Statement) and maintain each item’s original order, our extracted values are:\n\nValue1 (Balance Sheet – Paid-in Capital) = 28000000.00  \nValue2 (Income Statement – Profit Before Tax) = 2858088.75  \nValue3 (Cash Flow Statement – Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable) = 0.00\n\nThus, the final solution is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"28000000.00\", \"value2\": \"2858088.75\", \"value3\": \"0.00\"}}",
