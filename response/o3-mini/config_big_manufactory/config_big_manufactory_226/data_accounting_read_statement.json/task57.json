Typically, this corresponds to the \"Accounts Payable\" line item (or the related change amount in the operating cash flow). In the provided statement, look at the following:\n\n• On the balance sheet, the \"Accounts Payable\" line shows 0.00 at both the beginning and end dates.\n• In the cash flow statement, the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is given as 0.00.\n\nSince there is no increase in Accounts Payable, the addition in the amount owed for goods or services received on credit is 0.00.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"0.00\"}}",
