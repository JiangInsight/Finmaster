                        "content": "We need to determine – from the “Sale” transactions – the total “cost_amount” that was recorded for items sold. (That “cost_amount” represents the cost-of‐the products that have been “sold” and is what is “used up” from inventory. This is what eventually appears as the “Cost of Goods Sold” in the income statement.)\n\nStep 1. Go through the transactions and pick out those rows having type “Sale.” (Ignore transfers, purchases, expenses, depreciation, interest and fixed assets purchases.) In our data the relevant sale rows are:\n\n1. Sale20240105004 – cost_amount = 1,000,000.00  \n2. Sale20240107006 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.00  \n3. Sale20240111008 – cost_amount = 500,000.00  \n4. Sale20240114011 – cost_amount = 1,000,000.00  \n5. Sale20240117015 – cost_amount = 800,000.00  \n6. Sale20240118016 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.00  \n7. Sale20240119018 – cost_amount = 500,000.00  \n8. Sale20240121020 – cost_amount = 500,000.00  \n9. Sale20240125022 – cost_amount = 500,000.00  \n10. Sale20240128026 – cost_amount = 500,000.00  \n11. Sale20240130027 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.00  \n12. Sale20240131029 – cost_amount = 1,000,000.00  \n13. Sale20240201031 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.00  \n14. Sale20240203034 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.00  \n15. Sale20240204037 – cost_amount = 800,000.00\n\nStep 2. Sum these cost amounts:\n  1,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 2,500,000  \n  + 500,000 = 3,000,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 4,000,000  \n  + 800,000 = 4,800,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 6,300,000  \n  + 500,000 = 6,800,000  \n  + 500,000 = 7,300,000  \n  + 500,000 = 7,800,000  \n  + 500,000 = 8,300,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 9,800,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 10,800,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 12,300,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 13,800,000  \n  + 800,000 = 14,600,000\n\nStep 3. Thus, the final “Cost of Goods Sold” value is 14,600,000.00.\n\nThe final answer in the required json format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Cost of Goods Sold': '14600000.00'} }",
