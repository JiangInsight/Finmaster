Then by “walking” through each row we add or subtract money when (a) you pay out cash (for purchases or expenses paid in Cash and “cash to bank” transfers that move cash out) and (b) add cash when funds are received (for sales paid in Cash and “bank to cash” transfers).\n\nAfter careful step‐by‐step tracking, the overall “cash on hand” balance ends up at –2,414,620.22 (a “negative” cash position indicating that, taken by itself, the cash account has been reduced by more outflows than inflows).\n\nThus, the answer is provided in the requested JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"-2414620.22\"}}\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote:\n• The “Initial” value comes only from the single “Cash deposit” record.\n• All other transactions that used “Bank Transfer” or related to assets (or were recorded on Account Receivable, Unpaid, Depreciation, etc.) were not directly affecting cash on hand.\n• “Transfers” were used to “move back and forth” between bank and cash; a “Bank to cash” transfer increases cash on hand while a “Cash to bank” transfer decreases it.\n• The final computed cash figure is the net result after adding all in–flows and subtracting all out–flows.",
