                        "content": "We “start‐by” noting that the owner’s equity on the opening balance is made up only of the “initial” items – namely the cash deposit, the bank deposit and the fixed–asset contribution. In our sample “problem to solve” these are:\n\n • Cash deposit:     5,000,000.00 \n • Bank deposit:    15,000,000.00 \n • Fixed Assets (investment): 8,000,000.00\n\nThus the opening (initial) owners’ equity is\n\n  5,000,000.00 + 15,000,000.00 + 8,000,000.00 = 28,000,000.00\n\nNext we “simulate” the effect of operating transactions (i.e. the “income‐statement” side) over the period. In our simplified calculation the net change in equity (net income) is computed from\n\n  (i) the “profits” embedded in the sale transactions plus any interest “income” – and then \n  (ii) deducting the “operating expenses” (which include the expense items – Administrative, Sales, Financial – and also depreciation).\n\nA quick survey of the sales transactions shows that for each sale the “profit” (sale “after tax amount” minus the recorded cost) is already computed. In our problem the sale–type lines (by their id’s) show the following “profit” amounts (in order of occurrence):\n\n  463,032.36  \n  659,586.87  \n  249,601.75  \n  332,686.65  \n  347,555.96  \n  656,466.82  \n  168,808.14  \n  164,435.83  \n  174,830.39  \n  207,188.94  \n  591,831.76  \n  417,458.33  \n  499,604.61  \n  528,402.09  \n  256,960.17\n\nWhen you add all these up you obtain a total “sales profit” of about 5,718,450.67. \n\nAlso many “Interest Receivables” appear in the table (with amounts such as 1068.0; several 925.6’s; then 747.6’s; then lower‐level amounts – note that these represent additional “income”). When the positive interest amounts are summed, you get roughly 18,175.56.\n\nOn the cost side there are many “Expense” items. These include several Administrative, Sales and Financial expenses; and there are two separate Depreciation entries (one at 45,745.80 and another at 81,887.42). When all expense items are summed (as one may do by scanning all the “Expense…” rows) the grand total comes to about 2,438,585.75.\n\nThus the net income earned over the period is calculated as\n\n  Net income ≈ (Sales profit + Interest income) – total Expenses  \n       ≈ (5,718,450.67 + 18,175.56) – 2,438,585.75  \n       ≈ 5,736,626.23 – 2,438,585.75  \n       ≈ 3,298,040.48\n\nSince the owners’ equity in a “pure” (no‑dividend) situation increases by net income, the ending owner’s equity is\n\n  Ending Equity = Opening Equity + Net Income  \n         = 28,000,000.00 + 3,298,040.48  \n         ≈ 31,298,040.48\n\nNote that transfers among cash and bank, and purchase entries that merely “exchange” one asset for another (or record the acquisition of an asset that is already recorded as part of the business and then cost‐recorded later – as is usual in historical cost accounting) do not themselves affect the owners’ equity.\n\nThus, in our final answer we have:\n\n• Total Owners Equity Initial Value = 28,000,000.00  \n• Total Owners Equity End Value ≈ 31,298,040.48\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\", \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"31298040.48\"} }",
