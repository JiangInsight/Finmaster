                        "content": "We “back‐calculate” the operating earnings from the “profit” numbers that are already computed on the Sale transactions; then we subtract (or “charge”) the operating expenses (all Expense–type rows plus the Depreciation) and add the “interest revenue” (all Interest Receivables, note that these are not “paid” but they are income and count to earned income). (Other items such as initial injections, asset purchases and fixed‐asset acquisitions do not enter the profit‐calculation.)\n\nStep 1. We first add together every Sale’s “profit” (the amounts already computed on those transactions):\n\n  Sale20240105004:  463032.36  \n  Sale20240107006:  659586.87  \n  Sale20240111008:  249601.75  \n  Sale20240114011:  332686.65  \n  Sale20240117015:  347555.96  \n  Sale20240118016:  656466.82  \n  Sale20240119018:  168808.14  \n  Sale20240121020:  164435.83  \n  Sale20240201031:  499604.61  \n  Sale20240203034:  528402.09  \n  Sale20240204037:  256960.17  \n  Sale20240130027:  591831.76  \n  Sale20240131029:  417458.33  \n\nSumming these gives approximately 5,336,431.34.\n\nStep 2. Next we sum the “interest receivable” amounts from all the Interest–type rows. (For example, one row “Interest20240101001” gives 1068.0; then several rows giving 925.6, 747.6, 569.6, 480.6, 368.23, 242.90, 153.90, 64.90, 145.78, etc. When all 36 such entries are added the total is about 18,176.52.)\n\nStep 3. Then we sum all the “Expense” amounts – that is, all Expense rows (whether Administrative, Sales or Financial) plus also the Depreciation.\nFor example the “Expense” rows (from 2024‑01‑01 through early February 2024) add up to about 2,651,201.26; then plus the Depreciation row of 45,745.80 gives an “expense‐total” of about 2,696,947.06.\n\nStep 4. Finally, we combine these items in the “profit‐before‐tax” equation:\n  Profit before Tax = (Sum of Sale profits)\n            + (Sum of Interest Receivables)\n            – (Sum of all Expense + Depreciation amounts)\n\nThat is:\n  = 5,336,431.34 + 18,176.52 – 2,696,947.06  \n  = 5,354,607.86 – 2,696,947.06  \n  ≈ 2,657,660.80\n\nThus, the final profit before tax is about 2,657,660.80.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Profit Before Tax\": \"2657660.80\"}}",
