                        "content": "We need to “net‐off” all income items (the “Sale” transactions and the “Interest Receivables” that increase profit) against the operating expenses (expenses in the “Expense”, “Depreciation” and “Financial Expenses” rows). In our data many “Initial”, “Purchase” and “Fixed Assets” rows are balance‐sheet entries and do not affect current profit. (Only those “Sale” and “Interest” rows enter the income statement, while the “Expense” and “Depreciation” rows reduce profit.) \n\nMy “step‐by‐step” calculation went roughly as follows. (Note that for our work we must “pick out” only the rows whose type is “Sale”. In our table the “Sale”–type rows already carry a “profit” value. Then we add to that any “Interest Receivables” – these are recorded as income and in our list their amounts are positive. Next, we sum up (all) the Expense items – that is, all rows of type “Expense” (whether by category such as Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Financial Expenses) and both Depreciation rows (which are expenses too). Finally, we subtract total expenses from total income.)\n\nFor example, from our table the “Sale” rows were (with the pre‐computed “profit” items):\n\n • Sale20240105004: profit = 463032.36  \n • Sale20240107006: profit = 659586.87  \n • Sale20240111008: profit = 249601.75  \n • Sale20240114011: profit = 332686.65  \n • Sale20240117015: profit = 347555.96  \n • Sale20240118016: profit = 656466.82  \n • Sale20240119018: profit = 168808.14  \n • Sale20240121020: profit = 164435.83  \n • Sale20240125022: profit = 174830.39  \n • Sale20240128026: profit = 207188.94  \n • Sale20240130027: profit = 591831.76  \n • Sale20240131029: profit = 417458.33  \n • Sale20240201031: profit = 499604.61  \n • Sale20240203034: profit = 528402.09  \n • Sale20240204037: profit = 256960.17\n\nWhen added these “Sale” profits come to about 5,718,450.67.\n\nAlso, all the “Interest Receivables” (from several rows – see note below) total about 18,176.52.\n\nThus total “income” is roughly:  \n 5,718,450.67 + 18,176.52 = 5,736,627.19\n\nThen all “Expense”–side items (all “Administrative Expenses” plus “Sales Expenses” plus “Financial Expenses” plus the two Depreciation rows) were summed to be about 2,807,849.01.\n\nFinally, the net profit comes from subtracting the expenses from the income:\n\n Net profit ≈ 5,736,627.19 – 2,807,849.01 ≈ 2,928,778.18\n\n(Actual work must use all the rows carefully; the numbers above are arrived “by hand” – that is, by identifying and summing the corresponding values.)\n\nThus the final net profit is about 2,928,778.18.\n\nThe answer in the required json format is therefore:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"2928778.18\"}}\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nNote: In practice, one must carefully “pick” those transactions that affect the income statement; the initial capital injections and most “Purchase” entries (if capitalized) are balance–sheet events and do not change net profit.",
