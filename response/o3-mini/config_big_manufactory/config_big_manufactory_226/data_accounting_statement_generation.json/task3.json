                        "content": "We must first decide which transactions affect “inventory.” In our context only the “Purchase” and “Sale” transactions that involve a product (with a cost per unit, quantity, and unit‐price) affect the inventory balance; other “Initial” entries or other transactions (expenses, depreciation, transfers, interest, etc.) do not affect inventory.\n\nStep 1. Identify the opening inventory.\n• There is no “Initial…” record assigned to an inventory (the “Initial20231231001” records list cash, bank and fixed assets only). Thus we set\n  Inventory Initial Value = 0.00\n\nStep 2. Look at the “Purchase” transactions that add items to inventory. (We ignore the “Fixed Assets Purchase” type.)\nThe purchases are:\n • Purchase20231231001: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment D at 1,500,000.0 (value = 1,500,000.0)\n • Purchase20231231002: 2 units of Heavy Equipment D at 1,500,000.0 each (value = 3,000,000.0)\n • Purchase20231231003: 2 units of Heavy Equipment B at 800,000.0 each (value = 1,600,000.0)\n • Purchase20231231004: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment C at 1,000,000.0 (value = 1,000,000.0)\n • Purchase20231231005: 2 units of Heavy Equipment A at 500,000.0 each (value = 1,000,000.0)\n • Purchase20231231006: 2 units of Heavy Equipment C at 1,000,000.0 each (value = 2,000,000.0)\n • Purchase20231231007: 2 units of Heavy Equipment C at 1,000,000.0 each (value = 2,000,000.0)\n • Purchase20231231008: 2 units of Heavy Equipment B at 800,000.0 each (value = 1,600,000.0)\n • Purchase20231231009: 2 units of Heavy Equipment A at 500,000.0 each (value = 1,000,000.0)\n • Purchase20231231010: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment D at 1,500,000.0 (value = 1,500,000.0)\n • Purchase20231231011: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment A at 500,000.0 (value = 500,000.0)\n • Purchase20231231012: 2 units of Heavy Equipment A at 500,000.0 each (value = 1,000,000.0)\n • Purchase20231231013: 2 units of Heavy Equipment D at 1,500,000.0 each (value = 3,000,000.0)\n • Purchase20231231014: 2 units of Heavy Equipment D at 1,500,000.0 each (value = 3,000,000.0)\n\nLet’s sum their values:\n 1,500,000  \n+ 3,000,000 → 4,500,000  \n+ 1,600,000 → 6,100,000  \n+ 1,000,000 → 7,100,000  \n+ 1,000,000 → 8,100,000  \n+ 2,000,000 → 10,100,000  \n+ 2,000,000 → 12,100,000  \n+ 1,600,000 → 13,700,000  \n+ 1,000,000 → 14,700,000  \n+ 1,500,000 → 16,200,000  \n+ 500,000   → 16,700,000  \n+ 1,000,000 → 17,700,000  \n+ 3,000,000 → 20,700,000  \n+ 3,000,000 → 23,700,000\n\nTotal purchases add 23,700,000.\n\nStep 3. Now identify the “Sale” transactions that reduce the inventory. In these “Sale…” records the “cost_amount” is given; this represents the cost removed from inventory. They are:\n\n • Sale20240105004: cost_amount = 1,000,000.0  \n • Sale20240107006: cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n • Sale20240111008: cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n • Sale20240114011: cost_amount = 1,000,000.0  \n • Sale20240117015: cost_amount = 800,000.0  \n • Sale20240118016: cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n • Sale20240119018: cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n • Sale20240121020: cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n • Sale20240125022: cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n • Sale20240128026: cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n • Sale20240130027: cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n • Sale20240131029: cost_amount = 1,000,000.0  \n • Sale20240201031: cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n • Sale20240203034: cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n • Sale20240204037: cost_amount = 800,000.0\n\nNow add them:\n 1,000,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 2,500,000  \n+ 500,000   = 3,000,000  \n+ 1,000,000 = 4,000,000  \n+ 800,000   = 4,800,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 6,300,000  \n+ 500,000   = 6,800,000  \n+ 500,000   = 7,300,000  \n+ 500,000   = 7,800,000  \n+ 500,000   = 8,300,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 9,800,000  \n+ 1,000,000 = 10,800,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 12,300,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 13,800,000  \n+ 800,000   = 14,600,000\n\nSo sales cost removals total 14,600,000.\n\nStep 4. The final inventory value is computed as:\n Inventory End Value = (Opening + Purchases) – Sales (at cost)  \nSince Opening is 0:\n = 23,700,000 – 14,600,000  \n = 9,100,000\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Inventory End Value\": \"9100000.00\"\n}\n\nBelow is the final answer in JSON format.",
