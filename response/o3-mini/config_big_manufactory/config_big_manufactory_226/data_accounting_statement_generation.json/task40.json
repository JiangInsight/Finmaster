                        "content": "We ultimately need to determine by how much “inventory” has changed from the beginning till‐end of the period – that is, the sum of inventory “increases” (purchases) minus the “reductions” (sales of goods that were held as inventory). (Note that while “inventory” is normally a working‐capital item rather than a “profit” figure, for the purposes of preparing a cash flow statement working–capital adjustment we consider the difference between what was “purchased” (a use of cash that increases inventory on hand) and what was “sold” (which “uses up” inventory). In the cash flow statement an increase in inventory is “shown” as a negative adjustment because it uses cash.) \n\nBelow is one way to “reconstruct” the inventory change from the transactions data that affect inventory (ignoring the “initial” and fixed asset entries, which are not “inventory”):\n\nStep 1. Identify the “Purchase” transactions that added items to inventory. In our data these come under type “Purchase” and have (for our products) a cost–per–unit and quantity. We list them (with amounts already provided):\n\n • Purchase20231231001 for Heavy Equipment D: 1 × 1,500,000 = 1,500,000  \n • Purchase20231231002 for Heavy Equipment D: 2 × 1,500,000 = 3,000,000  \n • Purchase20231231003 for Heavy Equipment B: 2 × 800,000 = 1,600,000  \n • Purchase20231231004 for Heavy Equipment C: 1 × 1,000,000 = 1,000,000  \n • Purchase20231231005 for Heavy Equipment A: 2 × 500,000 = 1,000,000  \n • Purchase20231231006 for Heavy Equipment C: 2 × 1,000,000 (note: the cost_per_unit here is given as 1,000,000? Actually the “cost amount” is recorded as 2,000,000) = 2,000,000  \n • Purchase20231231007 for Heavy Equipment C: 2 × 1,000,000 = 2,000,000  \n • Purchase20231231008 for Heavy Equipment B: 2 × 800,000 = 1,600,000  \n • Purchase20231231009 for Heavy Equipment A: 2 × 500,000 = 1,000,000  \n • Purchase20231231010 for Heavy Equipment D: 1 × 1,500,000 = 1,500,000  \n • Purchase20231231011 for Heavy Equipment A: 1 × 500,000 = 500,000  \n • Purchase20231231012 for Heavy Equipment A: 2 × 500,000 = 1,000,000  \n • Purchase20231231013 for Heavy Equipment D: 2 × 1,500,000 = 3,000,000  \n • Purchase20231231014 for Heavy Equipment D: 2 × 1,500,000 = 3,000,000  \n\nSumming these gives a total “purchases” cost of:\n  1,500,000 + 3,000,000 = 4,500,000  \n  + 1,600,000 = 6,100,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 7,100,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 8,100,000  \n  + 2,000,000 = 10,100,000  \n  + 2,000,000 = 12,100,000  \n  + 1,600,000 = 13,700,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 14,700,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 16,200,000  \n  + 500,000 = 16,700,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 17,700,000  \n  + 3,000,000 = 20,700,000  \n  + 3,000,000 = 23,700,000\n\nSo the purchases added 23,700,000 to the inventory balance.\n\nStep 2. Identify the “Sale” transactions that “use up” (remove) inventory. (When a sale occurs the cost of the goods sold (at “cost_per_unit”×quantity) is “taken” out of the inventory.) In our data the sale-type rows include a “cost_per_unit” value. We find the following (each sale is for one unit in our records):\n\n • Sale20240105004 for Heavy Equipment C: removal of 1 × 1,000,000 = 1,000,000  \n • Sale20240107006 for Heavy Equipment D: removal of 1 × 1,500,000 = 1,500,000  \n • Sale20240111008 for Heavy Equipment A: removal of 1 × 500,000 = 500,000  \n • Sale20240114011 for Heavy Equipment C: removal of 1 × 1,000,000 = 1,000,000  \n • Sale20240117015 for Heavy Equipment B: removal of 1 × 800,000 = 800,000  \n • Sale20240118016 for Heavy Equipment D: removal of 1 × 1,500,000 = 1,500,000  \n • Sale20240119018 for Heavy Equipment A: removal of 1 × 500,000 = 500,000  \n • Sale20240121020 for Heavy Equipment A: removal of 1 × 500,000 = 500,000  \n • Sale20240201031 for Heavy Equipment D: removal of 1 × 1,500,000 = 1,500,000  \n • Sale20240130027 for Heavy Equipment D: removal of 1 × 1,500,000 = 1,500,000  \n • Sale20240131029 for Heavy Equipment C: removal of 1 × 1,000,000 = 1,000,000  \n • Sale20240203034 for Heavy Equipment D: removal of 1 × 1,500,000 = 1,500,000  \n • Sale20240204037 for Heavy Equipment B: removal of 1 × 800,000 = 800,000\n\nSumming these “cost removals”:\n  1,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 2,500,000  \n  + 500,000 = 3,000,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 4,000,000  \n  + 800,000 = 4,800,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 6,300,000  \n  + 500,000 = 6,800,000  \n  + 500,000 = 7,300,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 8,800,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 10,300,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 11,300,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 12,800,000  \n  + 800,000 = 13,600,000\n\nSo sales “removed” 13,600,000 from inventory.\n\nStep 3. The net change in inventory is then:\n  23,700,000 (purchases) – 13,600,000 (sales) = 10,100,000\n\nFor the cash flow statement, an increase in inventory is shown with a negative sign (because it represents a use of cash). Therefore the final entry (the “(Increase) Decrease in Inventory” item) is –10,100,000.00.\n\nWe then express the answer in the requested json format.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-10100000.00\"} }",
