                        "content": "We need to decide which transactions increase the “accounts payable” balance. In our sample problem the “accounts payable” came only from purchase transactions recorded “on credit” (that is, with an “Unpaid” payment/receipt status and a payment method of “Account Payable”). (For example, in the sample the two purchase transactions that were “Unpaid” (with payment_method “Account Payable”) totaled 290000 + 1300000 = 1590000.) \n\nWhen we review the current problem’s transactions we note the following:\n• The initial “Initial” rows list Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets. None of these represent a liability.\n• The purchase transactions (those with type “Purchase”) all show a payment/receipt_status of “Paid” and none is using “Account Payable” as the payment method. In other words, no purchase appears to have been made on credit.\n\nThus no liability is created for purchases (or other transactions) on credit so that no accounts payable is recorded.\n\nAs a result, the opening (initial) accounts payable remains zero and—since no unpaid purchase or other liability increased it—the end-of‑period (final) accounts payable is also zero.\n\nTherefore, our answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"0.00\"\n  }\n}",
