                        "content": "We have to “reverse‐engineer” which transactions form a current liability. Recall that in a balance sheet current liabilities are the obligations that the company has to pay over the near future (for example what is owed to suppliers). In these transaction ledgers many entries are asset “initial” deposits, fixed assets and actually paid purchases and expenses. Only those transactions that are “purchases” that have not yet been paid (or are otherwise recorded as “payable”) would normally be recorded as a current liability. Also note that even though there are “Interest Receivables” entries with an “Unpaid” status, they are not liabilities but rather amounts due from customers (i.e. an asset). \n\nLet us check the new dataset:\n\n• The “Initial” transactions (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) are contributions (assets).\n\n• All of the “Purchase” entries (for Heavy Equipment or other products) show a payment status “Paid” (and even the ones involving bank transfers are paid immediately) so there is no accumulated unpaid supplier balance.\n\n• The “Expense” lines (whether Administrative, Sales, or Financial) are recorded “Paid.”\n\n• The “Interest Receivables” lines are “Unpaid” but these represent income that still has not been received – they are receivables (an asset), not a payable (a liability).\n\nThus, throughout the period there are no transactions that lead to an outstanding “Accounts Payable” or other accrued payables. (By contrast, in the sample dataset the presence of some purchases with “Unpaid” status led to a nonzero current liability amount.)\n\nSince no transaction in the new dataset is “unpaid” in a way that creates an accounts payable, we conclude that at the beginning the current liabilities balance was zero and the ending (or “final”) current liabilities remains zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"0.00\"\n  }\n}\n---------------------------------------------------",
