                        "content": "We must “build” the fixed‐assets “net” value from the list of transactions that affect fixed‐assets. In our case we follow a classic approach: start with the “Initial Fixed Assets” from the “Initial20231231001 – Fixed Assets” entry; then add all new fixed‑asset purchases (both from “Purchase” entries that involve heavy equipment plus any entries whose type is “Fixed Assets Purchase”) and then “deduct” two things. First, any depreciation entries for fixed assets and second, any disposals (that is, fixed‑asset sales) in which the asset’s cost is removed from the balance. (In practice an entity “writes off” the historical cost when a fixed asset is sold.)\n\nBelow we explain our reasoning step‐by‐step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Fixed assets “initial” amount\n\n• From the very first “Initial20231231001” row having type “Fixed Assets” the amount is 8,000,000.0.\n  → Fixed assets “initial” = 8,000,000.00\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Add acquisitions (purchases that add fixed assets)\n\nOur table lists many “Purchase” transactions – each “Purchase” that supplies heavy equipment (whether Heavy Equipment A, B, C or D) is taken as an acquisition of a fixed asset. (Also there are two “Fixed Assets Purchase” entries.) Let us list and sum them.\n\nA) “Purchase” entries by their amounts:\n • Purchase20231231001:         1,500,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231002:         3,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231003 (Heavy Equipment B):  1,600,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231004 (Heavy Equipment C):  1,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231005 (Heavy Equipment A):  1,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231006 (Heavy Equipment C):  2,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231007 (Heavy Equipment C):  2,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231008 (Heavy Equipment B):  1,600,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231009 (Heavy Equipment A):  1,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231010 (Heavy Equipment D):  1,500,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231011 (Heavy Equipment A):   500,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231012 (Heavy Equipment A):  1,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231013 (Heavy Equipment D):  3,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231014 (Heavy Equipment D):  3,000,000.0  \n  Subtotal of these “Purchase” entries = 23,700,000.0\n\nB) Additionally, two “Fixed Assets Purchase” entries add:\n • FixedAsset20231231001 (first):      1262568.05  \n • FixedAsset20231231001 (second):     1408259.42  \n  Subtotal = 1,262,568.05 + 1,408,259.42 = 2,670,827.47\n\nThus the total additions from purchases = 23,700,000.0 + 2,670,827.47 = 26,370,827.47\n\nNow add the initial fixed assets:\n Total “fixed assets available” before reductions = 8,000,000.00 + 26,370,827.47 = 34,370,827.47\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Less reductions\n\nTwo kinds of reductions are applied:\n (a) Depreciation;\n (b) Disposal of fixed assets (when fixed assets are sold, the “cost_amount” on the sale is removed).\n\n(a) Depreciation entries:\n • Depreciation20240101001: 45,745.8  \n • Depreciation20240201002: 81,887.42  \nSum depreciation = 45,745.8 + 81,887.42 = 127,633.22\n\n(b) Disposal (sales) entries – from those “Sale” transactions that involve heavy equipment (product_id P001, P002, P003, or P004 – that is, Heavy Equipment A, B, C or D) the “cost_amount” is removed. (For example, in a sale the asset is “written‐off” from the balance.) Our review shows the following sales (each showing its fixed asset’s cost_amount):\n\n • Sale20240105004 (Heavy Equipment C):     1,000,000.0  \n • Sale20240107006 (Heavy Equipment D):     1,500,000.0  \n • Sale20240111008 (Heavy Equipment A):      500,000.0  \n • Sale20240114011 (Heavy Equipment C):     1,000,000.0  \n • Sale20240117015 (Heavy Equipment B):      800,000.0  \n • Sale20240118016 (Heavy Equipment D):     1,500,000.0  \n • Sale20240119018 (Heavy Equipment A):      500,000.0  \n • Sale20240121020 (Heavy Equipment A):      500,000.0  \n • Sale20240125022 (Heavy Equipment A):      500,000.0  \n • Sale20240130027 (Heavy Equipment D):     1,500,000.0  \n • Sale20240131029 (Heavy Equipment C):     1,000,000.0  \n • Sale20240201031 (Heavy Equipment D):     1,500,000.0  \n • Sale20240203034 (Heavy Equipment D):     1,500,000.0  \n • Sale20240204037 (Heavy Equipment B):      800,000.0  \n  When summed these fixed‑asset “sales” cost amounts add up to approximately 14,100,000.0\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Compute the fixed assets net end value\n\nUsing the “equation”:\n  Fixed assets net end value = (Initial fixed assets + Fixed asset additions) – (Depreciation + Disposals)\n\nThat is:\n  = 34,370,827.47 – (127,633.22 + 14,100,000.0)\n  = 34,370,827.47 – 14,227,633.22\n  ≈ 20,143,194.25\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThus our results are:\n\n• Fixed assets net Initial Value: 8,000,000.00  \n• Fixed assets net End Value: 20,143,194.25\n\nWe now present our answer in the required JSON format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"fixed assets net Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"fixed assets net End Value\": \"20143194.25\"\n  }\n}\n\n──────────────────────────────\nNote:\nBecause the transactions span many entries we assumed that every “Purchase” for “Heavy Equipment” or every “Fixed Assets Purchase” represents a capital acquisition and that every “Sale” (with a cost_amount provided) represents a disposal of fixed assets. Depreciation entries are deducted as well.",
