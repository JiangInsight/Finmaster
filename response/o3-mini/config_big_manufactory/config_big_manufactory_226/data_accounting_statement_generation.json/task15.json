                        "content": "We first review the list of transaction records and then ask ourselves which of these transactions “create” or “affect” liabilities. In many accounting systems the “liability” side of the balance sheet comes from amounts that the business owes (for example, unpaid purchases or amounts recorded as “account payable”). In the sample problem some Purchase transactions were recorded as “Unpaid” (or used a payment method such as “Account Payable”) so that in the final liabilities item a positive balance was found. \n\nLet’s look at the new problem’s data step by step:\n\n• The “Initial” transactions (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) set up the opening balances. These are asset items (cash, bank, and fixed assets) and do not create any liability. (In the sample the initial liabilities were “0.00” because there was no opening liability.)\n\n• All of the Purchase transactions in the new data are marked “Paid” – none of them are left “unpaid” or use a “Account Payable” payment method. (For example, look at Purchase20231231001, Purchase20231231002, … Purchase20231231014 – they are paid by Cash, Bank Transfer, etc.) Since none of these purchased items remain on credit, they do not “create” a liability on the balance sheet.\n\n• Other transactions such as Expenses (administrative, sales, financial) are paid. They are recorded as operating outflows and—again—do not leave any payable amount outstanding.\n\n• Other lines (such as “Interest Receivables” or even “Sale” when recorded “Unpaid”) in our records do show an “Unpaid” flag. However, by standard accounting principles an “Interest Receivable” or an “Unpaid Sale” represents an asset (money owed to the company) rather than a liability.\n\nTherefore, none of the transaction records in the new problem produce a liability item – neither at the beginning (the “Initial” entries) nor through later transactions (no purchase or payable item remains unpaid).\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\nTotal Liabilities Initial Value = 0.00  \nTotal Liabilities End Value = 0.00\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"0.00\"\n  }\n}",
