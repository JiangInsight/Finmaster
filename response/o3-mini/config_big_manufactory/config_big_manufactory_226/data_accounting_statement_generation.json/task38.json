                        "content": "We need to find how much accounts receivable has changed during the period. In our data only “Sale” transactions in which the “receive_method” is “Account Receivable” (or a very similar spelling) are “credit” sales that have not been collected. (Other “Sale” transactions received in Cash are not included.) So we scan through the table and pick those rows whose “type” is Sale and where the “receive_method” field indicates a receivable. For each such transaction, we add its “amount” (which is the after‐tax/sale amount that is supposed to be collected later).\n\nBelow are the “Sale” entries that use Account Receivable (or “Account Receviable”) as the receive method:\n\n1. Sale20240111008 – amount = 749,601.75  \n2. Sale20240114011 – amount = 1,332,686.65  \n3. Sale20240118016 – amount = 2,156,466.82  \n4. Sale20240119018 – amount = 668,808.14  \n5. Sale20240125022 – amount = 674,830.39  \n6. Sale20240128026 – amount = 707,188.94  \n7. Sale20240131029 – amount = 1,417,458.33  \n8. Sale20240201031 – amount = 1,999,604.61  \n9. Sale20240203034 – amount = 2,028,402.09  \n10. Sale20240204037 – amount = 1,056,960.17\n\nNow, add these amounts step‐by‐step:\n\n• 749,601.75  \n + 1,332,686.65 = 2,082,288.40  \n• 2,082,288.40  \n + 2,156,466.82 = 4,238,755.22  \n• 4,238,755.22  \n + 668,808.14  = 4,907,563.36  \n• 4,907,563.36  \n + 674,830.39  = 5,582,393.75  \n• 5,582,393.75  \n + 707,188.94  = 6,289,582.69  \n• 6,289,582.69  \n + 1,417,458.33 = 7,707,041.02  \n• 7,707,041.02  \n + 1,999,604.61 = 9,706,645.63  \n• 9,706,645.63  \n + 2,028,402.09 = 11,735,047.72  \n• 11,735,047.72  \n + 1,056,960.17 = 12,792,007.89\n\nThus the total “credit sales” (i.e. accounts receivable) increased by 12,792,007.89. In the cash‐flow statement an increase in accounts receivable represents an uses of cash (money earned on credit is not received in cash yet) so it is reported with a minus sign.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-12792007.89\"\n}\n\nBelow is the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-12792007.89\"\n  }\n}",
