                        "content": "We must “simulate” a full cash‐flow result by “adding” every transaction that affects available cash and “subtracting” those that “use” cash. (Remember that noncash items such as depreciation do not change cash and that transfers between cash and bank do not change the net available cash amount.) \n\nBelow is one possible step‐by‐step explanation:\n\n1. The “Initial” items include two cash/in‑bank deposits that add to the available cash and equivalents. In our case the “Cash deposit” of 5,000,000.0 and “Bank deposit” of 15,000,000.0 provide a starting balance of 20,000,000.0. (The “Fixed Assets” initial record is an allocation to fixed assets and is not “cash”.)\n\n2. Then every “Purchase” (when “Paid” by Cash or Bank Transfer) and every “Expense” (when “Paid” by Cash) will reduce cash. Also, sales made – if their payment is received in cash – will add to cash. (Items that are marked “Unpaid” or recorded as “Account Receivable” do not immediately affect cash.) Similarly, depreciation entries and “Interest Receivables” with an Unpaid status are noncash and are omitted.\n \n3. In the dataset each transaction line was reviewed:\n • All “inflows” (starting deposits plus sales received for cash) were added.\n • All “outflows” (purchases, expenses and fixed asset purchases paid in cash or by bank transfer) were subtracted.\n • Transfers between bank and cash were net‐zero for the overall pool.\n \n4. After “listing” all 67 outflow records (from purchases, expenses and fixed asset acquisitions) and the cash inflows from sales that were “Paid by Cash” plus the two initial deposits, the arithmetic sum was computed.\n \nFor instance, the deposits gave a total of 20,000,000.0 while the cash sales received during the period (for those marked “Paid” in Cash) summed to about 2,752,442.78 – so the total cash inflow was:\n  20,000,000.0 + 1,463,032.36 + 2,159,586.87 + 1,147,555.96 + 664,435.83 + 2,091,831.76 ≈ 27,526,442.78.\n \nThe sum of all cash‐using outflows (purchases, expenses, and fixed asset cash purchases) was determined to be approximately 29,121,732.69.\n \nThen the net increase in cash is calculated by subtracting outflows from inflows:\n  Net Increase ≈ 27,526,442.78 – 29,121,732.69 ≈ –1,595,289.91.\n \nThus, our final net cash and cash equivalents decreased by about 1,595,289.91.\n\nThe answer is therefore provided in the requested JSON format.\n\nBelow is the final answer:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"-1595289.91\"}}\n```",
