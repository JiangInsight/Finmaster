                        "content": "We have to “total” the expenses that will later appear on the income statement. In many accounting systems only rows that represent an outflow of operating costs (for example, those with type “Expense…”, “Depreciation” and possibly “Financial Expenses” if they come as a cost item) are included. In our case, we do not include “Purchase”, “Initial”, “Fixed Assets”, “Transfer” or “Interest Receivables” records.\n\nHere is how we proceed step‐by‐step:\n\n1. Look through the table and select only rows whose “type” begins with “Expense” or “Depreciation”. (For example, “Administrative Expenses”, “Sales Expenses”, “Financial Expenses”, “Depreciation”, etc.) – We ignore rows such as “Purchase…”, “Initial…”, “Interest Receivables”, “Sale…” and “Transfer…”. \n\n2. Then we sum up the “amount” field of each such row. (Note that even if some “Expense” rows have sub–types such as “Sales Expenses” or “Administrative Expenses” the amount is already given; similarly, the “Depreciation” row is added.)\n\nBelow is the list of rows we include along with their amounts:\n\n• Expense20240101001 | Administrative Expenses = 22,627.45  \n• Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation = 45,745.80  \n• Expense20240102001 | Sales Expenses = 46,979.81  \n• Expense20240102001 | Sales Expenses = 74,676.94  \n• Expense20240103001 | Administrative Expenses = 82,626.66  \n• Expense20240104001 | Sales Expenses = 91,203.96  \n• Expense20240105001 | Administrative Expenses = 88,832.94  \n• Expense20240106001 | Sales Expenses = 48,338.22  \n• Expense20240107001 | Sales Expenses = 70,747.99  \n• Expense20240108001 | Financial Expenses = 50,023.11  \n• Expense20240109001 | Administrative Expenses = 63,781.14  \n• Expense20240110001 | Administrative Expenses = 17,367.28  \n• Expense20240111001 | Sales Expenses = 69,689.43  \n• Expense20240112001 | Administrative Expenses = 23,656.57  \n• Expense20240112001 | Administrative Expenses = 73,796.40  \n• Expense20240113001 | Financial Expenses = 28,003.75  \n• Expense20240113001 | Sales Expenses = 24,301.99  \n• Expense20240114001 | Sales Expenses = 13,935.29  \n• Expense20240115001 | Sales Expenses = 94,522.33  \n• Expense20240115001 | Administrative Expenses = 11,866.24  \n• Expense20240116001 | Sales Expenses = 14,007.04  \n• Expense20240117001 | Administrative Expenses = 39,116.77  \n• Expense20240118001 | Administrative Expenses = 85,094.80  \n• Expense20240118001 | Sales Expenses = 77,436.59  \n• Expense20240119001 | Sales Expenses = 63,998.62  \n• Expense20240119001 | Administrative Expenses = 78,029.68  \n• Expense20240120001 | Administrative Expenses = 87,806.28  \n• Expense20240121001 | Sales Expenses = 73,276.35  \n• Expense20240122001 | Administrative Expenses = 87,718.66  \n• Expense20240122001 | Administrative Expenses = 55,688.08  \n• Expense20240123001 | Administrative Expenses = 24,806.74  \n• Expense20240123001 | Administrative Expenses = 64,609.83  \n• Expense20240124001 | Administrative Expenses = 61,908.14  \n• Expense20240125001 | Sales Expenses = 54,057.70  \n• Expense20240126001 | Financial Expenses = 58,288.72  \n• Expense20240126001 | Sales Expenses = 22,649.15  \n• Expense20240127001 | Sales Expenses = 12,511.13  \n• Expense20240128001 | Financial Expenses = 92,015.10  \n• Expense20240129001 | Administrative Expenses = 15,519.56  \n• Expense20240130001 | Sales Expenses = 34,241.97  \n• Expense20240130001 | Financial Expenses = 69,087.29  \n• Expense20240131001 | Sales Expenses = 79,626.05  \n• Expense20240201001 | Administrative Expenses = 29,567.17  \n• Expense20240201001 | Sales Expenses = 54,401.69  \n• Depreciation20240201002 | Depreciation = 81,887.42  \n• Expense20240202001 | Sales Expenses = 32,829.36  \n• Expense20240202001 | Administrative Expenses = 91,158.78  \n• Expense20240203001 | Sales Expenses = 41,600.41  \n• Expense20240203001 | Sales Expenses = 98,291.18  \n• Expense20240204001 | Sales Expenses = 16,499.17  \n• Expense20240204001 | Administrative Expenses = 22,133.18  \n• Expense20240205001 | Sales Expenses = 48,059.69  \n• Expense20240205001 | Sales Expenses = 67,892.84  \n\nWhen we add all these amounts (see detailed arithmetic in our work above), the sum is 2,878,538.44.\n\nThus the final “Total Expenses” item that would appear in the income statement is 2,878,538.44.\n\nThe answer is then presented as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Expenses\": \"2878538.44\"}}",
