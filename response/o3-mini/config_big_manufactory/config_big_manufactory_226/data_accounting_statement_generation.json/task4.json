                        "content": "We need to “build up” the AR value using only those transactions that (a) are “Sale” transactions and (b) that are not received in cash but instead “on‐credit” (i.e. their “receive_method” is set to “Account Receviable” or “Account Receivable”). In our posted table the only “Initial” transactions are deposits (cash, bank, fixed assets) so the beginning balance for trade receivables is zero.\n\nThen we go through the sale rows and select those with receive_method equal to “Account Receviable” (usually marked “Unpaid”) so that the sale proceeds have not yet been collected. In the posted table these are the sales (by id) along with their “amount” as follows:\n\n1. Sale20240111008 – amount = 749,601.75  \n2. Sale20240114011 – amount = 1,332,686.65  \n3. Sale20240118016 – amount = 2,156,466.82  \n4. Sale20240119018 – amount = 668,808.14  \n5. Sale20240125022 – amount = 674,830.39  \n6. Sale20240128026 – amount = 707,188.94  \n7. Sale20240131029 – amount = 1,417,458.33  \n8. Sale20240201031 – amount = 1,999,604.61  \n9. Sale20240203034 – amount = 2,028,402.09  \n10. Sale20240204037 – amount = 1,056,960.17  \n\n(Other “Sale” rows received by “Cash” have already been collected, so they are not included in AR.)\n\nWe add these amounts step‐by‐step: \n\n• 749,601.75 + 1,332,686.65 = 2,082,288.40  \n• 2,082,288.40 + 2,156,466.82 = 4,238,755.22  \n• 4,238,755.22 + 668,808.14 = 4,907,563.36  \n• 4,907,563.36 + 674,830.39 = 5,582,393.75  \n• 5,582,393.75 + 707,188.94 = 6,289,582.69  \n• 6,289,582.69 + 1,417,458.33 = 7,707,041.02  \n• 7,707,041.02 + 1,999,604.61 = 9,706,645.63  \n• 9,706,645.63 + 2,028,402.09 = 11,735,047.72  \n• 11,735,047.72 + 1,056,960.17 = 12,792,007.89  \n\nThus the closing (ending) accounts receivable balance is 12,792,007.89 while no beginning balance is recorded (initial receivables are zero).\n\nAccordingly, our answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"12792007.89\"\n  }\n}",
