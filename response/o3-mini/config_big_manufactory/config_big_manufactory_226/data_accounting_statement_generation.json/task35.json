All “Sale” transactions were summed to yield Main Business Revenue (and Total Revenue) of 19,643,620.28.  \n2. The cost side on sold items (from the cost_amount provided on the sale rows) summed to 14,100,000.00. Subtracting COGS from revenue gives a gross profit of 5,543,620.28.  \n3. Operating expenses were broken down into Administrative Expenses (totaling 1,038,879.42), Selling Expenses (1,325,774.90), Depreciation (sum of 45,745.80 and 81,887.42 = 127,633.22) and Financial Expenses (177,399.12). Their sum is 2,669,686.66.  \n4. Separately, all interest receivable items (regardless of payment status) summed to approximately 18,176.52 – taken as Interest Income.  \n5. Profit before tax was computed as Gross Profit plus Interest Income minus Total Expenses, i.e. 5,543,620.28 + 18,176.52 – 2,669,686.66 = 2,892,110.14.  \n6. With an assumed effective tax rate of about 20% (consistent with prior similar examples), the tax expense is 20% of 2,892,110.14, i.e. 578,422.03.  \n7. Finally, Net Profit is Profit Before Tax less Tax Expense, which is 2,892,110.14 – 578,422.03 = 2,313,688.11.\n\nThe numbers have been rounded to two decimals as shown.",
