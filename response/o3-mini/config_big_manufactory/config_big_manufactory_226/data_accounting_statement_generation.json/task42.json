                        "content": "We have to “extract” the tax‐information (that is, the tax amounts reported on sales) and then “net” them against any tax liability reduction (for example, by any tax payments or tax credits from other entries). In our case the only entries that actually carry a tax figure are those for “Sale” transactions – every sale row lists a “tax_amount” along with the “after_tax_amount” (and the cost/profit which are not used here). None of the other transactions shows a tax or “tax payment” effect. (In many accounting systems, sales generate “input” tax payable that then remains on the balance sheet until verified and remitted; if you have no separate tax remittance transaction then the change in the tax‐payable balance is simply the sum of the taxes accrued on sales.) \n\nLet’s list the sale rows (they are the rows whose “type” is “Sale”) along with the tax_amount values:\n\n1.
