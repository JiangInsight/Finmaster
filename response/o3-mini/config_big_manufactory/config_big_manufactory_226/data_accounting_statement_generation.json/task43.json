                        "content": "We must “filter‐in” only those cash transactions that are related to the day‐to‐day operations (for example, expenses and receipts from “core operations”) while (a) leaving out receipts that come from “deposit” or “issue of equity” and (b) “purchases” of equipment and “fixed asset” transactions plus “transfers” (which are usually investing/financing items). In our “problem” table all “Sale” lines (of Heavy Equipment) are considered proceeds from the sale of property – i.e. investing dues – and therefore are not “operating”  \n\nAlso, note that non‐cash adjustments such as “Depreciation” are not “paid” and do not affect the actual cash flow (so we ignore depreciation here when computing a “direct‐view” net operating cash flow). Finally, several “Interest Receivables” are recorded as “Unpaid” so they do not represent cash received.\n\nIn the table the only “operating” cash “payment” lines are those whose “type” is “Expense” (whether labeled “Administrative Expenses,” “Sales Expenses” or “Financial Expenses”). We can ignore all “Sale” transactions (all relate to heavy equipment), all “Purchase” transactions (which are capital expenditures) and all “Transfers” (cash‐to‐bank or bank‐to‐cash) plus the “Initial” and “Fixed Assets” ones.\n\nA step–by–step approach (we show the “expense” cash outflows only):\n\n1.
