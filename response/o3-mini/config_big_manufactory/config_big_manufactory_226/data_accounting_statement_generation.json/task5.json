                        "content": "We need to “build” the ending balance of the Interest Receivables account. In our “balance‐sheet” the interest receivable account starts with no opening balance (that is, none of the “Initial…” transactions use an “Interest Receivables” account) so its initial balance is 0.00. Then we add each “Interest Receivables” transaction (only those rows whose type is “Interest Receivables”) to determine the ending balance.\n\nStep‐by‐step, here is what we do:\n\n1. Look through the table and pick out every row with type exactly “Interest Receivables.” (Other types like “Depreciation” or “Fixed Assets” are not included in this account.)\n\n2. For each such row we add its transaction “amount” (which in our table is the column “amount”). Note that the amounts come with various decimals. For our summary we list (with rounding to two decimals) the following values:\n\n  • 1068.00  \n  • 925.60  \n  • 925.60  \n  • 925.60  \n  • 925.60  \n  • 925.60  \n  • 925.60  \n  • 925.60  \n  • 747.60  \n  • 747.60  \n  • 747.60  \n  • 747.60  \n  • 747.60  \n  • 747.60  \n  • 747.60  \n  • 569.60  \n  • 569.60  \n  • 569.60  \n  • 480.60  \n  • 480.60  \n  • 368.23  \n  • 368.23  \n  • 242.90  \n  • 242.90  \n  • 242.90  \n  • 153.90  (×5 rows around here)  \n  • 153.90  \n  • 153.90  \n  • 153.90  \n  • 153.90  \n  • 64.90  (×2)  \n  • 64.90  \n  • 145.78  \n  • 137.04  \n  • 44.60  \n  • 34.28  \n\n3. We then sum these values:\n  – The first “batch” (the single 1068.00 plus the seven rows of 925.60) comes to about 7547.20  \n  – The next seven rows of 747.60 add about 5233.20 (total 12780.40)  \n  – Then three rows of 569.60 add 1708.80 (total 14489.20)  \n  – Then two rows of 480.60 add 961.20 (total 15450.40)  \n  – Two rows of 368.23 give 736.46 (total 16186.86)  \n  – Three rows of 242.90 give 728.69 (total 16915.55)  \n  – Five rows of 153.90 give 769.48 (total 17685.03)  \n  – Two rows of 64.90 give 129.79 (total 17814.83)  \n  – Then adding 145.78 gives 17960.61  \n  – Adding 137.04 gives 18097.65  \n  – Adding 44.60 gives 18142.25  \n  – Finally adding 34.28 gives an ending balance of approximately 18176.52\n\n4. Since there is no prior balance for “Interest Receivables” (none of the initial entries relate to interest) we conclude that the “Interest Receivable Initial Value” is 0.00 and the “Interest Receivable End Value” is 18176.52.\n\nThus, our answer is:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"18176.52\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis is the result calculated by summing all the “Interest Receivables” transaction amounts from January and February 2024.",
