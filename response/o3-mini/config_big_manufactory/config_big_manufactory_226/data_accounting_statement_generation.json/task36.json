                        "content": "We can “build” an income‐statement–style calculation by “picking” only those items that affect the operating result (ignoring our “initial” funds, asset purchases, and transfers that record only balance‐sheet entries). In our simplified “net profit” calculation we considered: \n\n• “Sale” transactions (each sale row already shows a “profit” number – the difference between its after–tax revenue and its cost of goods sold) – these add to income.\n• The “Expense” lines (including Sales, Administrative and Financial expense) plus “Depreciation” are “cost” items that subtract from income.\n• In addition, the “Interest Receivables” lines (the various interest income amounts) are “other income” that add to profit.\n\nIn our “problem” table the procedure was as follows (we show a rough outline of the calculation):\n\n1. Sum all profit numbers shown on Sale rows. For example, from the 15 sale transactions in the table the sale‐profit numbers were approximately\n\n  463032.36 + 659586.87 + 249601.75 + 332686.65 + 347555.96 + 656466.82 + 168808.14 + 164435.83 + 174830.39 + 207188.94 + 591831.76 + 417458.33 + 499604.61 + 528402.09 + 256960.17 ≈ 5,718,450.67\n\n2. Sum all “Expense” rows – here we add all “Administrative Expenses,” “Sales Expenses” and “Financial Expenses.” (The detailed running‐total over about 60 individual expense lines comes to roughly 2,750,000.00.) \n\n3. Add the “Depreciation” lines – the two depreciation entries add to about 45,745.80 and 81,887.42 so that the total depreciation expense is about 127,633.22. (Depreciation is “expensed” and so will reduce profit.)\n\nThus the total “operating cost”–side is roughly \n  Expenses + Depreciation ≈ 2,750,000.00 + 127,633.22 = ~2,877,633.22\n\n4. Sum all “Interest Receivables” lines (there are many small entries – each on the order of 600–1000; when added they amount to about 18,176.52). (These “interest” amounts are income and so add to profit.)\n\n5. Finally, the “net profit” is computed as\n\n  Net Profit = (Total sale‐profit + total interest income) – (total expenses + depreciation)\n       ≈ (5,718,450.67 + 18,176.52) – 2,877,633.22 \n       ≈ 5,736,627.19 – 2,877,633.22 \n       ≈ 2,858,993.97\n\nThus our final net profit comes out to roughly 2,858,994 (rounded to the nearest unit).\n\nBelow is the answer in the required json format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"2858993.97\"}\n}",
