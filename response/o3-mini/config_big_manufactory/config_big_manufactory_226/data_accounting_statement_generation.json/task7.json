                        "content": "We must “build” the cost–side of fixed assets from the trial‐balance of transactions. In our ledger the “fixed assets” balance comes both from an “initial” fixed‐asset entry and from later acquisitions (by “Purchase” or “Fixed Assets Purchase” entries) of capital “Heavy Equipment…”, while later “Sale” entries (for fixed asset items) remove (discontinue) amounts from the fixed–asset balance. (Other everyday expense items or “depreciation” entries do not directly alter the “cost” balance.) \n\nLet’s explain step‐by‐step using the numbers from the provided table.\n\nStep 1. Find the “initial” fixed assets entry.  \n • The “Initial20231231001” row with type “Fixed Assets” shows an amount of 8,000,000.0.  \n  → Initial fixed asset value = 8,000,000.00\n\nStep 2. Sum all the acquisitions (additions to fixed assets).  \nMany of the “Purchase” entries (and the ones with type “Fixed Assets Purchase”) are for items named “Heavy Equipment …” which we assume are capitalized as fixed assets.\n\n(a) From the “Purchase” rows (by their id order):\n • Purchase20231231001: 1,500,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231002: 3,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231003: 1,600,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231004: 1,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231005: 1,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231006: 2,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231007: 2,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231008: 1,600,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231009: 1,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231010: 1,500,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231011: 500,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231012: 1,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231013: 3,000,000.0  \n • Purchase20231231014: 3,000,000.0  \n  Let’s add these up:  \n  1,500,000 + 3,000,000 = 4,500,000  \n  + 1,600,000 = 6,100,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 7,100,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 8,100,000  \n  + 2,000,000 = 10,100,000  \n  + 2,000,000 = 12,100,000  \n  + 1,600,000 = 13,700,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 14,700,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 16,200,000  \n  + 500,000 = 16,700,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 17,700,000  \n  + 3,000,000 = 20,700,000  \n  + 3,000,000 = 23,700,000  \n → Total from these purchase rows = 23,700,000.0\n\n(b) Then add the two “Fixed Assets Purchase” entries:\n • One FixedAsset20231231001 row shows 1,262,568.05  \n • A later FixedAsset20231231001 row shows 1,408,259.42  \n  Their sum = 1,262,568.05 + 1,408,259.42 = 2,670,827.47\n\nSo total “acquisition additions” (other than the opening balance) equals  \n 23,700,000.0 + 2,670,827.47 = 26,370,827.47\n\nStep 3. Sum all the fixed‐asset “sale” (disposal) entries.  \nWe scan the “Sale” rows that involve heavy equipment items (by product name) and note that when a fixed asset is sold the “cost_amount” (its cost basis) is removed:\n\nThe relevant sale entries (with product names “Heavy Equipment …”) and their cost_amount figures are:\n\n • Sale20240105004 (“Heavy Equipment C”): cost_amount = 1,000,000.0  \n • Sale20240107006 (“Heavy Equipment D”): cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n • Sale20240111008 (“Heavy Equipment A”): cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n • Sale20240114011 (“Heavy Equipment C”): cost_amount = 1,000,000.0  \n • Sale20240117015 (“Heavy Equipment B”): cost_amount = 800,000.0  \n • Sale20240118016 (“Heavy Equipment D”): cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n • Sale20240119018 (“Heavy Equipment A”): cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n • Sale20240121020 (“Heavy Equipment A”): cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n • Sale20240125022 (“Heavy Equipment A”): cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n • Sale20240128026 (“Heavy Equipment A”): cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n • Sale20240130027 (“Heavy Equipment D”): cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n • Sale20240131029 (“Heavy Equipment C”): cost_amount = 1,000,000.0  \n • Sale20240201031 (“Heavy Equipment D”): cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n • Sale20240203034 (“Heavy Equipment D”): cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n • Sale20240204037 (“Heavy Equipment B”): cost_amount = 800,000.0  \n\nNow, sum these cost amounts step‐by‐step:\n 1000000  \n+ 1500000 = 2500000  \n+ 500000 = 3000000  \n+ 1000000 = 4000000  \n+ 800000 = 4800000  \n+ 1500000 = 6300000  \n+ 500000 = 6800000  \n+ 500000 = 7300000  \n+ 500000 = 7800000  \n+ 500000 = 8300000  \n+ 1500000 = 9800000  \n+ 1000000 = 10800000  \n+ 1500000 = 12300000  \n+ 1500000 = 13800000  \n+ 800000 = 14600000  \n\nThe total cost removed by sales is 14,600,000. (Our running sum here shows 14,600,000; note that earlier a sum of 14,100,000 was found—but here carefully summing we get 14,600,000. Let’s re‐check quickly by grouping:  \n Group 1: 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 500,000 = 3,000,000  \n Group 2: 1,000,000 + 800,000 = 1,800,000 (total 4,800,000 so far)  \n Group 3: 1,500,000 + 500,000 = 2,000,000 (total 6,800,000)  \n Group 4: 500,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 = 1,500,000 (total 8,300,000)  \n Group 5: 1,500,000 + 1,000,000 = 2,500,000 (total 10,800,000)  \n Group 6: 1,500,000 + 1,500,000 = 3,000,000 (total 13,800,000)  \n Group 7: add last 800,000 = 14,600,000)  \nSo, yes, total disposed = 14,600,000. \n\nStep 4. Now compute the “end‐of–period” fixed assets “cost” balance.\n\nTotal cost added (including initial) =\n Initial (8,000,000.00) + All additions (26,370,827.47) = 8,000,000.00 + 26,370,827.47 = 34,370,827.47\n\nLess the disposals from sale = 14,600,000.00\n\nThus, final fixed assets cost = 34,370,827.47 – 14,600,000.00 = 19,770,827.47\n\n(If you wish to round to two decimals, you get 19,770,827.47.)\n\nNote on rounding and differences: (There can be small differences if one has fewer or different sale entries but based on the transactions provided the arithmetic as above is used.)\n\nThus our answers are:\n\n• Fixed Assets Initial Value: 8000000.00  \n• Fixed Assets End Value: 19770827.47\n\n(We note that our final number here is 19,770,827.47 which is the result after subtracting 14,600,000 from 34,370,827.47.)\n\nNow we present the answer as required in JSON output format.\n\nFinal answer in JSON:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"19770827.47\"\n  }\n}\n\n(End of solution.)",
