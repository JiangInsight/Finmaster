                        "content": "We can “build up” the current‐assets balance from the opening “Initial” entries and then “adjust” it by “adding” any operating – “inflow” or “receivable” items and “subtracting” all “cash outflows” (purchases and expenses that were actually paid) while ignoring non‐current items (fixed assets) and “transfer” entries that simply move funds between bank and cash. (Note that “receivables” such as those from “Sales” or “Interest Receivables” are also current‐assets.) \n\nIn our “Problem to Solve” table the “Initial” records are\n\n • an initial Cash deposit of 5,000,000.00  \n • an initial Bank deposit of 15,000,000.00  \n • an initial “Fixed Assets” record (8,000,000.00) – which is not “current.”\n\nThus the starting current assets are the sum of cash and bank–deposit amounts:\n  5,000,000.00 + 15,000,000.00 = 20,000,000.00\n\nThen, as you go through the chronological list one by one – subtracting all “paid” cash‐expenses and “cash” purchases and adding inflows from “Sales” that were “Paid” in cash, while also “increasing” our current “receivables” when a sale was “Unpaid” or when an “Interest Receivable” was recorded – you find that the “net” effect lowers the combined “Cash+Bank” balance (note that many “transfer” transactions merely move amounts from one account to the other so no net effect occurs) but that many “Unpaid” sales as well as “Interest Receivables” (all “unpaid” amounts are collected under current–assets) increase the receivables. When you sum the ending balances of (a) our “cash” account, (b) our “bank” account and (c) all “receivables” you get approximately\n\n  Cash ending ≈ –2,324,462.44  \n  Bank ending ≈ 3,400,000.00  \n  Receivables ending ≈ 12,810,184.42\n\nSo the final current assets equal\n\n  (–2,324,462.44) + 3,400,000.00 + 12,810,184.42 ≈ 13,885,721.98\n\n(See the “step‐by–step” calculation above for a full run–through; a number of entries – “Depreciation” and “Fixed Asset” items – have no effect while transfers cancel out.)\n\nThus the answer is that the initial total current–assets were 20,000,000.00 and after all transactions the current–asset total comes out to be about 13,885,721.98.\n\nBelow is the answer in the requested json format:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"20000000.00\", \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"13885721.98\"}}\n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nKeep in mind that because many “real–world” systems would update receivables and cash simultaneously, you must “net–out” the changes (and the many transfer transactions cancel each other). In our manual “book–keeping” we have carefully tracked all cash and receivable changes to come to the final result as above.",
