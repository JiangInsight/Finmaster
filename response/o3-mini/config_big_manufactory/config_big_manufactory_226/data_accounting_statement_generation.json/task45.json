In our data the investing transactions include the following:\n\n• Purchases (cash outflows) of heavy equipments and “fixed assets” that raise long term asset balances. (We “skip” the initial “opening‐balance” transactions – these appear on the balance sheet but are not “flow” items.)\n\n• Sales (cash inflows) of heavy equipments that are disposed of – but only when cash is received (i.e. “Paid” status).\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the relevant transactions (using the “amount” fields) as they appear in the provided list:\n\n───────────────────────────── \nOutflow transactions (cash paid for asset acquisitions):\n1.
