                        "content": "We can “derive” taxes payable by imagining that only tax‐related entries come from sales (that is, tax levied on sales is collected from customers and—in the absence of any input tax credit from purchases—is recorded as a payable until remitted). In our work we assume that the “Initial” lines (the opening “Initial20231231001” entries) never create a tax liability so that the “taxes payable” initially is zero. Then each sale transaction carries a “tax_amount” (that is the tax collected on that sale) that—in the final “balance‐sheet” view—should be aggregated. (No “input tax” credits are reported on the purchases in this problem so that no offset is taken.) \n\nStep 1. Identify the three “Initial…” entries. They show cash, bank and fixed asset contributions. None has any “tax_amount” field; therefore the opening “taxes payable” is 0.00.\n\nStep 2. Find all transactions where type = “Sale”. In our dataset the sale transaction rows are – for example – the following (with their “tax_amount”):\n • Sale20240105004 → 7,3151.62  \n • Sale20240107006 → 107,979.34  \n • Sale20240111008 → 37,480.09  \n • Sale20240114011 → 66,634.33  \n • Sale20240117015 → 57,377.80  \n • Sale20240118016 → 107,823.34  \n • Sale20240119018 → 33,440.41  \n • Sale20240121020 → 33,221.79  \n • Sale20240125022 → 33,741.52  \n • Sale20240128026 → 35,359.45  \n • Sale20240130027 → 104,591.59  \n • Sale20240131029 → 70,872.92  \n • Sale20240201031 → 99,980.23  \n • Sale20240203034 → 101,420.10  \n • Sale20240204037 → 52,848.01  \n\nStep 3. Sum these tax_amount values. We add:\n 73151.62 + 107979.34 = 181130.96  \n 181130.96 + 37480.09 = 218611.05  \n 218611.05 + 66634.33 = 285245.38  \n 285245.38 + 57377.80 = 342623.18  \n 342623.18 + 107823.34 = 450446.52  \n 450446.52 + 33440.41 = 483886.93  \n 483886.93 + 33221.79 = 517108.72  \n 517108.72 + 33741.52 = 550850.24  \n 550850.24 + 35359.45 = 586209.69  \n 586209.69 + 104591.59 = 690801.28  \n 690801.28 + 70872.92 = 761674.20  \n 761674.20 + 99980.23 = 861654.43  \n 861654.43 + 101420.10 = 963074.53  \n 963074.53 + 52848.01 = 1,015922.54  \n\nThat is, the total “tax_amount” coming from our sale transactions is 1,015,922.54.\n\nStep 4. Because no opening tax balance was given (and the “Initial” transactions carry no tax) we assume that the “taxes payable” at period–end equals the sum of these sale tax amounts. (In a fuller model, one might subtract — if available — any tax credits on purchases, but no such items appear here.)\n\nThus the final answer is:\n Taxes Payable Initial Value: 0.00  \n Taxes Payable End Value: 1015922.54\n\nPresenting the answer in the required json format:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"1015922.54\"} }",
