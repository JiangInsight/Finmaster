                        "content": "We need to “build up” the balance‐sheet “non‐current assets” (i.e. property, plant and equipment) by starting with the opening (“initial”) fixed assets balance (taken from the “Initial… Fixed Assets” row) and then adding all later “acquisition” transactions (that is, all Purchase and Fixed Assets Purchase entries – here “heavy equipment” and other “capital” items) while “reducing” the value by any depreciation recorded. (Other items such as cash, bank deposits, operating expenses, interest, etc. are not part of property, plant and equipment.) \n\nBelow is one way to “simulate” the calculation from the table provided.\n\nStep 1. Find the “initial” amount for non‐current assets.  \n  The “Initial20231231001” row with type “Fixed Assets” shows an amount of 8,000,000.00.  \n   Initial non‑current assets = 8,000,000.00\n\nStep 2. Identify and sum the “acquisitions” that add to property, plant and equipment.  \nWe include any record whose “type” is either “Purchase” (with heavy capital items – here all purchases on 2023‑12‑31 where the product is “Heavy Equipment …”) or a “Fixed Assets Purchase” record. In the problem table the following transactions add “new” assets: \n\nPurchases (by id – note that each “Purchase” is for a capital asset):\n\n • Purchase20231231001: 1,500,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231002: 3,000,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231003: 1,600,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231004: 1,000,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231005: 1,000,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231006: 2,000,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231007: 2,000,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231008: 1,600,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231009: 1,000,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231010: 1,500,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231011: 500,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231012: 1,000,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231013: 3,000,000.00  \n • Purchase20231231014: 3,000,000.00\n\nIf you add these up you get:  \n  1,500,000 + 3,000,000 = 4,500,000  \n  + 1,600,000 = 6,100,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 7,100,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 8,100,000  \n  + 2,000,000 = 10,100,000  \n  + 2,000,000 = 12,100,000  \n  + 1,600,000 = 13,700,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 14,700,000  \n  + 1,500,000 = 16,200,000  \n  +   500,000 = 16,700,000  \n  + 1,000,000 = 17,700,000  \n  + 3,000,000 = 20,700,000  \n  + 3,000,000 = 23,700,000\n\nNext, also add the “Fixed Assets Purchase” transactions which are separate (these show up with type “Fixed Assets Purchase”):  \n • FixedAsset20231231001 (the first one) shows 1,262,568.05  \n • FixedAsset20231231001 (the later one) shows 1,408,259.42  \n\nTheir sum = 1,262,568.05 + 1,408,259.42 = 2,670,827.47\n\nThus the value added by acquisitions is  \n  23,700,000.00 (from Purchases) + 2,670,827.47 (from Fixed Asset purchases)  \n      = 26,370,827.47  \n\nStep 3. Find out the “deductions” from non‐current assets (typically depreciation).  \nWe see two depreciation transactions:  \n • Depreciation20240101001: 45,745.80  \n • Depreciation20240201002: 81,887.42  \n\nTheir sum = 45,745.80 + 81,887.42 = 127,633.22\n\nStep 4. Compute the end-of‑period (balance‐sheet) non‑current assets.  \nWe begin with the initial non‑current assets, add the acquisitions and then subtract depreciation. That is:\n\n End Value = Initial Fixed Assets + (Acquisitions) – (Depreciation)  \n  = 8,000,000.00 + 26,370,827.47 – 127,633.22  \n  = 34,370,827.47 – 127,633.22  \n  ≈ 34,243,194.25\n\nThus the final balance of non‐current assets coming into the balance sheet is approximately 34,243,194.25.\n\nWe then present the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\nBelow is the answer:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '34243194.25'} }\n``` \n\nNote: In our calculation the “initial” non‑current assets come solely from the opening “Fixed Assets” balance, and subsequently all purchase (capital) expenditures and fixed asset purchases are added while accumulated depreciation is subtracted.",
