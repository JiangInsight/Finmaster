                        "content": "We can “back‐solve” the “net retained earnings” added into liabilities & owner’s equity by noticing that in the example the “Initial” value (the sum of the “Initial” rows) is carried forward and then the “profit” on “Sale” transactions is added in. (All other entries – expenses, purchases, depreciation, etc. – do not change the overall “liabilities & owners equity” but merely “re‐arrange” the balance sheet.) \n\nIn the sample the three “Initial” entries were \n  cash deposit = 3,000,000 \n  bank deposit = 5,000,000 \n  fixed assets = 5,000,000 \ngiving an “initial” total of 13,000,000. Then the net sale “profit” amounts (from each sale line’s “profit” field) summed to 216,409.49 so that the final “liabilities & owners equity” was 13,000,000 + 216,409.49 = 13,216,409.49.\n\nIn our “problem to solve” the first three rows (the ones whose id begins with “Initial…”) show \n  Cash deposit = 5,000,000.0 \n  Bank deposit = 15,000,000.0 \n  Fixed Assets = 8,000,000.0 \nwhose sum is\n\n  5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 28,000,000.00\n\n(We assume that these “initial” entries represent the funding provided by the owners so that the balance–sheet “liabilities & owners equity” start at 28,000,000.) \n\nThen we go though the records with type “Sale” (note that only sales show a “profit” field – the others (Purchases, Expenses, etc.) are “balance‐sheet” entries that simply reassign amounts between asset accounts and liabilities; they do not change the net owners’ equity):\n \nLet’s list the “Sale” lines with their “profit” amounts (as provided in the “profit” column):\n\n1. Sale20240105004: profit = 463032.36  \n2. Sale20240107006: profit = 659586.87  \n3. Sale20240111008: profit = 249601.75  \n4. Sale20240114011: profit = 332686.65  \n5. Sale20240117015: profit = 347555.96  \n6. Sale20240118016: profit = 656466.82  \n7. Sale20240119018: profit = 168808.14  \n8. Sale20240121020: profit = 164435.83  \n9. Sale20240201031: profit = 499604.61  \n10. Sale20240203034: profit = 528402.09  \n11. Sale20240204037: profit = 256960.17  \n12. Sale20240131029: profit = 417458.33  \n\nNow, summing these profit amounts step‐by‐step we get:\n \n  463032.36  \n+ 659586.87 = 1,122,619.23  \n+ 249601.75 = 1,372,220.98  \n+ 332686.65 = 1,704,907.63  \n+ 347555.96 = 2,052,463.59  \n+ 656466.82 = 2,708,930.41  \n+ 168808.14 = 2,877,738.55  \n+ 164435.83 = 3,042,174.38  \n+ 499604.61 = 3,541,778.99  \n+ 528402.09 = 4,070,181.08  \n+ 256960.17 = 4,327,141.25  \n+ 417458.33 = 4,744,599.58  \n\nThus the net profit (i.e. the “retained earnings” portion that is added to the beginning owners equity) is 4,744,599.58. \n\nThen the final “Total Liabilities and Owners Equity” equals\n\n  Initial (28,000,000.00) + Net profit (4,744,599.58) = 32,744,599.58\n\nFor presentation we round each figure to two decimals.\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n--------------------------------\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\", \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"32744599.58\"} }",
