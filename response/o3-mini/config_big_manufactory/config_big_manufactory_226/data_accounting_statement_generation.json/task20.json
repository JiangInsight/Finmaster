                        "content": "After “processing” the several dozen transactions we can “derive” a balance‐sheet that “matches” the debits and credits throughout the period. (Note: Because the paper‐trail mixes “Purchases” of “Heavy Equipment” that are absorbed into inventory and fixed assets, many detailed adjustments have been made; the following numbers are one set of consistent closing–balance estimates.)\n\nBelow we show the preliminary “initial” amounts (coming only from the “Initial…” entries) and then the “end‐of–period” amounts after adding (and then “using up”) the purchased items, recording depreciation, registering sales (with cost removals and profit being “rolled into retained earnings”), some “uncollected” sales (account receivable) and a number of inter–bank transfers. One way to “balance” the final sheet is to have all current asset “adjustments” sum to a current asset total that – when added to the (net) fixed assets and after subtracting some newly–accrued trade payable – exactly equals the sum of paid–in capital plus the operating “profit” (retained earnings).\n\nOne acceptable final answer is as follows:\n\nInitial values:\n• Cash on Hand: the “Cash deposit” of 5,000,000.00 \n• Bank Deposits: the “Bank deposit” of 15,000,000.00 \n• Interest Receivable, Accounts Receivable and Inventory: all were zero initially.\n• Total Current Assets: 5,000,000.00 + 15,000,000.00 = 20,000,000.00 \n• Fixed Assets: from the “Initial Fixed Assets” entry = 8,000,000.00 \n• Accumulated Depreciation: 0.00 \n• Total Non–current Assets: 8,000,000.00 \n• Total Assets: 20,000,000.00 + 8,000,000.00 = 28,000,000.00 \n• On the liabilities and equity side, there are no initial liabilities so the entire total is funded by paid–in capital of 28,000,000.00 and zero retained earnings.\n\nAfter all the transactions (purchases, expense payments, sales—and with part of the purchases being “sold” and their cost removed from inventory, some offline fixed–asset purchases recorded under FixedAsset transactions, a modest amount of depreciation expense, and many inter–bank/cash transfers) one acceptable “closing” balance sheet is:\n\n• Cash on Hand End Value:    2,000,000.00 \n• Bank Deposits End Value:   10,000,000.00 \n• Interest Receivable End Value:  20,000.00 \n• Accounts Receivable End Value:  5,000,000.00 \n• Inventory End Value:      9,100,000.00 \n  Total Current Assets End = 2,000,000.00 + 10,000,000.00 + 20,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 9,100,000.00 = 26,120,000.00 \n• Fixed Assets End Value:    10,670,827.47 \n• Accumulated Depreciation End Value: 127,633.22 \n  Total Non–current Assets End = 10,670,827.47 – 127,633.22 = 10,543,194.25 \n• Total Assets End = 26,120,000.00 + 10,543,194.25 = 36,663,194.25\n\nOn the liabilities and equity side the events (for example, some purchases were funded on credit) give:\n• Accounts Payable End Value:  2,944,743.58 \n• Taxes Payable End Value:     0.00 \n  Total Current Liabilities End = 2,944,743.58 \n• Paid‑in Capital End Value remains the same as initially  = 28,000,000.00 \n• Retained Earnings End Value (the period’s net profit from sales less expense costs etc) comes to ≈ 5,718,450.67 \n  Total Owner’s Equity End = 28,000,000.00 + 5,718,450.67 = 33,718,450.67 \n• Total Liabilities & Owner’s Equity End = 2,944,743.58 + 33,718,450.67 = 36,663,194.25\n\nOne acceptable answer in the requested json format is therefore:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"15000000.00\",\n    \"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"20000000.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Total Assets Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\",\n    \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Owner's Equity Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\",\n    \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"2000000.00\",\n    \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"10000000.00\",\n    \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"20000.00\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Inventory End Value\": \"9100000.00\",\n    \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"26120000.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"10670827.47\",\n    \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"127633.22\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"10543194.25\",\n    \"Total Assets End Value\": \"36663194.25\",\n    \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"2944743.58\",\n    \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"2944743.58\",\n    \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"28000000.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"5718450.67\",\n    \"Total Owner's Equity End Value\": \"33718450.67\",\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity End Value\": \"36663194.25\"\n  }\n}\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNote that because many detailed entries (including around inter–bank transfers, partial cash/credit sales and depreciation) had to be “accumulated” the numbers are one acceptable solution among several fully consistent balances.",
