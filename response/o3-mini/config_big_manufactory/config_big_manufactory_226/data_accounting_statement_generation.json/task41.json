In this new task all the purchase transactions are marked as “Paid” (even if the purchases are large amounts, they were immediately paid with Cash or Bank Transfer) so none of these transactions create an outstanding liability on the accounts payable side.\n\nSince no purchase was recorded as “Unpaid” (and there is no other transaction that increases accounts payable) the net change (increase or decrease) in accounts payable is zero.\n\nThus, the final accounts payable item in the cash flow statement is 0.00.\n\nThe answer in the requested format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"0.00\"}}",
