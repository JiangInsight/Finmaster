From the initial entries the company started with a cash deposit of 5,000,000.00 and a bank deposit of 15,000,000.00 – a total “Beginning Balance” of 20,000,000.00. (The fixed‐asset initial, although recorded, does not count as immediately “cash”.)\n\n2. The “Net Profit” was computed by summing the profit figures on each sale transaction – in this example the total comes out to 5,336,431.34.\n\n3. Since noncash “Depreciation” entries (45745.80 on 2024–01–01 plus 81887.42 on 2024–02–01) total 127633.22 they are added back in the operating section.\n\n4. A very large amount of sales were made on “account receivable” (i.e. not received in cash immediately) – an increase of 10,839,489.13 – so that change is subtracted in operating activities. Likewise, the relatively small increases in “interest receivable” (totaling 18,176.56) reduce operating cash inflows.\n\n5. In this example no net change is assumed in inventory, accounts payable or tax payable so those adjustments are nil.\n\n6. Thus the “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities” is –5,403,601.13.\n\n7. In the investing section, every purchase of heavy equipment (plus the two separate fixed‐asset purchase entries) was treated as an outlay. Their amounts sum to 26,370,827.47, so the “Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities” is –26,370,827.47.\n\n8. There are no investing inflows and all the inter‐bank or internal “transfer” transactions cancel each other out; hence the “Cash Flow from Investing Activities” overall is 0.00 and “Cash and Cash Equivalents” show solely the net effect from operating and investing activities.\n\n9. Finally, the “Ending Balance” is calculated by adding the net changes (–5,403,601.13 and –26,370,827.47, i.e. a “Net Increase” of –31,774,428.60) to the beginning balance of 20,000,000.00, giving –11,774,428.60.\n\nNote that while a negative ending cash balance is unusual in practice, in a constructed problem like this the numbers reflect the heavy fixed‐asset investments relative to the cash collections from operating activity.\n",
