                        "content": "We can think of “final total cost” as the sum‐of the cost component (the “cost_amount” field on each sale transaction) that appears on the income statement. (That is, in an income statement the “Cost of Sales” is often computed as the cost assigned to the goods that were sold.) \n\nLet’s review the data: Notice that every “Sale” row in the table has a field called cost_amount. (Other transactions like “Purchase” or “Expense” are not used directly in that “cost” item.) In this dataset the sale transactions are as follows (reading in order, with their “cost_amount” values):\n\n1. Sale20240105004 – cost_amount = 1,000,000.00  \n2. Sale20240107006 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.00  \n3. Sale20240111008 – cost_amount = 500,000.00  \n4. Sale20240114011 – cost_amount = 1,000,000.00  \n5. Sale20240117015 – cost_amount = 800,000.00  \n6. Sale20240118016 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.00  \n7. Sale20240119018 – cost_amount = 500,000.00  \n8. Sale20240121020 – cost_amount = 500,000.00  \n9. Sale20240201031 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.00  \n10. Sale20240203034 – cost_amount = 1,500,000.00  \n11. Sale20240204037 – cost_amount = 800,000.00  \n12. Sale20240131029 – cost_amount = 1,000,000.00  \n\nNow, let’s sum these values step-by-step:\n\n• 1,000,000.00 + 1,500,000.00 = 2,500,000.00  \n• 2,500,000.00 + 500,000.00 = 3,000,000.00  \n• 3,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 = 4,000,000.00  \n• 4,000,000.00 + 800,000.00 = 4,800,000.00  \n• 4,800,000.00 + 1,500,000.00 = 6,300,000.00  \n• 6,300,000.00 + 500,000.00 = 6,800,000.00  \n• 6,800,000.00 + 500,000.00 = 7,300,000.00  \n• 7,300,000.00 + 1,500,000.00 = 8,800,000.00  \n• 8,800,000.00 + 1,500,000.00 = 10,300,000.00  \n• 10,300,000.00 + 800,000.00 = 11,100,000.00  \n• 11,100,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 = 12,100,000.00  \n\nThus the sum of the “cost_amount” from all sale transactions is 12,100,000.00.\n\nThis is taken as the “final total cost item” on the income statement.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Total Cost\": \"12100000.00\"\n  }\n}",
