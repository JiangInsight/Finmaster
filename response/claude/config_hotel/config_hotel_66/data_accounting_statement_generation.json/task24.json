Let me double-check the purchase transactions first. The total purchases should specifically include all transactions of type \"Purchase\" that represent costs.\n\nAfter recounting and verifying, the total purchases amount to 8,395,770.00\n\nI also notice that the sum of the expenses appears low. Let me recheck all expense transactions...\n\nAfter reviewing all the expenses carefully, the total expenses add up to approximately 24,230.00\n\nAdding the depreciation, the final total cost is:\n8,395,770.00 + 24,230.00 + 91,509.94 = 8,511,509.94\n\nWhen I round this to 2 decimal places: 8,511,509.94\n\nWait, I need to be more precise with my calculation. Let me review the figures one more time to ensure accuracy.\n\nAfter a complete review of all cost-related transactions, I believe the correct total cost should be 8,420,000.00, rounded to 2 decimal places.\n\nGoing through the list again, the sum of all purchase transactions is: 8,395,770.00\nThe sum of all expense transactions is: 24,230.00\nThe sum of all depreciation is: 91,509.94\n\nTherefore, the total cost is: 8,395,770.00 + 24,230.00 + 91,509.94 = 8,511,509.94\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: 8,511,509.94\n\nSince the problem states we need the \"final total cost\" in the income statement, and looking at the expected format which has a field called \"Total Cost\", the answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Cost': '8511509.94'}}\n\nBut let me check again... looking at the example problem, the answer has \"Total Cost\" as \"4410000.00\". This suggests that the answer should be rounded and formatted to 2 decimal places. Let me update my answer:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Cost': '8511509.94'}}",
