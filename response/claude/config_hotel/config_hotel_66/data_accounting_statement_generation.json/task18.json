                        "content": "I need to calculate the owner's equity, which is essentially Assets - Liabilities, at the beginning and end of the period.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the initial owner's equity by looking at the initial deposits:\n\n```\nInitial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 3000000.0\nInitial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0\nInitial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 8000000.0\n```\n\nThese deposits represent the initial owner's equity, which totals:\n$3,000,000 + $5,000,000 + $8,000,000 = $16,000,000\n\nNow, to find the ending owner's equity, I need to consider all transactions affecting equity, primarily the net income/loss for the period.\n\nNet income consists of revenues (sales) minus expenses (including purchases, depreciation, and other expenses).\n\nLet me calculate each component:\n\n1. Sales Revenue: All transactions with \"Sale\" in the type\n2. Cost of Goods Sold: From the sales transactions (cost_amount)\n3. Expenses: Administrative, Sales, Financial expenses, and Depreciation\n4. Interest Income: Interest Receivables\n\nLet's compute each:\n\n1. Total Sales (including tax):\n   - Sum of all \"Sale\" transaction amounts = $746,932.93\n\n2. Cost of Goods Sold:\n   - Sum of cost_amount in sales transactions = $484,780.00\n\n3. Gross Profit:\n   - Sales - COGS = $746,932.93 - $484,780.00 = $262,152.93\n\n4. Expenses:\n   - Administrative expenses: $25,359.69\n   - Sales expenses: $5,934.59\n   - Financial expenses: $3,688.41\n   - Depreciation: $45,754.08 + $45,755.86 = $91,509.94\n   - Total expenses: $126,492.63\n\n5. Interest Income:\n   - Sum of Interest Receivables: $9,507.33\n\n6. Net Income:\n   - Gross Profit - Expenses + Interest Income\n   - $262,152.93 - $126,492.63 + $9,507.33 = $145,167.63\n\nGiven that the initial owner's equity was $16,000,000 and the net income for the period is $145,167.63, the ending owner's equity is:\n\n$16,000,000 + $145,167.63 = $16,145,167.63\n\nTherefore, the owner's equity values are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Owners Equity Initial Value': '16000000.00', 'Total Owners Equity End Value': '16145167.63'} }\n```",
