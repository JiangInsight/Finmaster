Initial cash balance: 3,000,000.00\n2. Cash purchases:\n   - Purchase20231231012: 177,000.00\n   - Purchase20231231017: 80,500.00\n3. Cash expenses:\n   - All expenses marked with \"Paid\" and \"Cash\" payment method\n4. Cash sales:\n   - All sales marked with \"Paid\" and \"Cash\" receive method\n\nLet me sum up all the relevant cash transactions:\n\n### Cash outflows:\n- Purchases paid by cash: 177,000.00 + 80,500.00 = 257,500.00\n- Expenses paid by cash (sum of all expense transactions with \"Cash\" payment method): 21,846.10\n- No cash transfers identified\n\n### Cash inflows:\n- Sales paid by cash (sum of all sale transactions with \"Cash\" receive method): 549,352.00\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final cash balance\n\nInitial cash: 3,000,000.00\n- Cash outflows (purchases + expenses): 257,500.00 + 21,846.10 = 279,346.10\n+ Cash inflows (sales): 549,352.00\n\nFinal cash balance = 3,000,000.00 - 279,346.10 + 549,352.00 = 3,270,005.90\n\nLet me verify this calculation:\n3,000,000.00 (initial) - 257,500.00 (cash purchases) - 21,846.10 (cash expenses) + 549,352.00 (cash sales) = 3,270,005.90\n\n## Final Answer:\nInitial cash on hand: 3,000,000.00\nFinal cash on hand: 3,270,005.90\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash on Hand Initial Value': '3000000.00', 'Cash on Hand End Value': '3270005.90'} }\n```",
