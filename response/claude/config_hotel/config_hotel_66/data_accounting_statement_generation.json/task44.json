First, I need to identify any transactions related to the purchase of fixed assets.\n2. These would typically be categorized as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar in the transaction type.\n\nLooking through the data, I can see a few types of transactions:\n- Initial balances\n- Purchases of various items (like room types and meal sets)\n- Sales\n- Expenses\n- Interest\n- Depreciation\n\nTo find fixed asset purchases specifically, I need to look for transactions marked as fixed asset purchases.\n\nIn the provided data, I don't see any explicit \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" transactions. Most of the purchases appear to be inventory or consumables like \"Banquet Set\", \"Luxury Suite\", \"Business Room\", etc., which are more likely part of the hotel's regular operations rather than fixed assets.\n\nHowever, the closest thing that might be considered fixed assets would be the \"Fixed Assets\" entry in the initial deposit, but this represents an opening balance, not a purchase during the period.\n\nGiven the absence of specific fixed asset purchases in this dataset, the value would be 0.\n\nHowever, I want to be careful and double-check if there might be any purchases that should be classified as fixed assets. Looking through the data again, I still don't see any clear fixed asset purchases.\n\nSince there are no transactions explicitly labeled as fixed asset purchases during the reporting period, the final purchase of fixed assets in the cash flow statement would be 0.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '0'} }\n```\n\nWait - I want to be extra careful here. Let me check if there might be any transactions that could be considered fixed asset purchases, even if not explicitly labeled as such.\n\nLooking more carefully, I don't see any entries marked specifically as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" in the transaction type column. The initial fixed assets entry is just setting up the starting balance, not representing a new purchase.\n\nSince I don't find any explicit fixed asset purchases in the transaction data, the value remains 0.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '0'} }",
