                        "content": "I'll calculate the inventory values by analyzing the purchase and sale transactions in the dataset.\n\n## Step 1: Identify inventory-related transactions\nI need to find all purchase and sale transactions to track inventory changes. These will be transactions with:\n- Type: \"Purchase\" (add to inventory)\n- Type: \"Sale\" (subtract from inventory)\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Initial Inventory Value\nFirst, I need to check if there's an explicit initial inventory value stated. Looking at the data, I don't see any initial inventory transaction labeled specifically for inventory. The first relevant transactions are purchases on 2023-12-31, which indicates the beginning inventory value is likely 0.\n\n## Step 3: Track Purchases\nLet me identify all purchase transactions and sum their values:\n\n```\nPurchase20231231001: 371,520.00 (Banquet Set)\nPurchase20231231002: 829,440.00 (Banquet Set)\nPurchase20231231003: 35,000.00 (Business Meal Set)\nPurchase20231231004: 1,250,000.00 (Luxury Suite)\nPurchase20231231005: 246,000.00 (Business Room)\nPurchase20231231006: 582,000.00 (Business Room)\nPurchase20231231007: 140,800.00 (Deluxe Meal Set)\nPurchase20231231008: 254,320.00 (Deluxe Meal Set)\nPurchase20231231009: 240,240.00 (Deluxe Meal Set)\nPurchase20231231010: 216,000.00 (Standard Room)\nPurchase20231231011: 540,000.00 (Luxury Suite)\nPurchase20231231012: 177,000.00 (Standard Room)\nPurchase20231231013: 585,000.00 (Luxury Suite)\nPurchase20231231014: 755,000.00 (Luxury Suite)\nPurchase20231231015: 59,850.00 (Business Meal Set)\nPurchase20231231016: 820,800.00 (Banquet Set)\nPurchase20231231017: 80,500.00 (Business Meal Set)\nPurchase20231231018: 328,000.00 (Business Room)\nPurchase20231231019: 32,850.00 (Quick Meal Set)\nPurchase20231231020: 36,050.00 (Business Meal Set)\nPurchase20231231021: 35,850.00 (Quick Meal Set)\nPurchase20231231022: 19,050.00 (Quick Meal Set)\nPurchase20231231023: 358,500.00 (Standard Room)\nPurchase20231231024: 402,000.00 (Standard Room)\n```\n\nTotal purchases: 8,395,770.00\n\n## Step 4: Track Sales and Calculate Cost of Goods Sold\nI need to track the cost amount for all sales to calculate the inventory reduction due to sales. The cost amount column directly shows the inventory cost of items sold.\n\nAdding up the cost amount for all sales from January 2024 to February 2024, I get a total cost of goods sold of 790,770.00.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate Ending Inventory\nEnding Inventory = Initial Inventory + Purchases - Cost of Goods Sold\nEnding Inventory = 0 + 8,395,770.00 - 790,770.00 = 7,605,000.00\n\nHowever, when looking at the example solution format and typical accounting practices, I notice there's likely a rounding to whole numbers. Checking for any potential calculation errors, I need to verify if the cost of goods sold total is accurate.\n\nLooking more carefully at the data and calculating precisely:\n\nThe total inventory purchases amount to 8,395,770.00.\nThe cost of goods sold from all sales totals 790,770.00.\n\nSince we started with zero inventory, the ending inventory should be 8,395,770.00 - 790,770.00 = 7,605,000.00.\n\nHowever, I need to double-check if this number aligns with standard accounting practices for how inventory is reported. Based on the example, the values appear to be rounded and reported in a specific way.\n\nAfter recalculating and verifying, I believe the correct ending inventory value should be reported as 7,605,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Initial Value': '0.00', 'Inventory End Value': '7605000.00'} }\n```",
