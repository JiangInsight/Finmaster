Let me analyze the data step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Calculate Net Profit\nFirst, I need to identify all income and expense transactions to calculate net profit.\n\n### Revenue (Sales):\nAll transactions with type 'Sale' represent revenue.\nAdding up all sales amounts: $690,486.31\n\n### Cost of Goods Sold:\nBased on the 'cost_amount' values in the sales transactions: $528,050.00\n\n### Gross Profit:\n$690,486.31 - $528,050.00 = $162,436.31\n\n### Expenses:\n- Administrative Expenses: $18,329.00\n- Sales Expenses: $5,543.47\n- Financial Expenses: $4,879.02\n- Depreciation: $91,509.94 (two entries of $45,754.08 and $45,755.86)\n\n### Total Expenses:\n$18,329.00 + $5,543.47 + $4,879.02 = $28,751.49\n\n### Net Profit:\n$162,436.31 - $28,751.49 - $91,509.94 = $42,174.88\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Changes in Working Capital\n\n### Accounts Receivable:\nFrom all sales with 'Account Receviable' as receive_method.\nTotal AR created: $315,356.41\n\n### Interest Receivable:\nFrom all 'Interest Receivables' transactions.\nTotal Interest Receivable: $8,825.35\n\n### Inventory:\nThis represents the purchases of products that would go into inventory.\nTotal inventory purchased: $5,903,060.00\n\n### Accounts Payable:\nFrom all purchases with 'Account Payable' as payment_method.\nTotal AP created: $4,673,360.00\n\n### Tax Payable:\nFrom the 'tax_amount' field in sales transactions.\nTotal tax payable: $34,524.32\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\nStarting with Net Profit: $42,174.88\nAdd back non-cash expenses (Depreciation): $91,509.94\nAdjust for changes in working capital:\n- (Increase) in Accounts Receivable: -$315,356.41\n- (Increase) in Interest Receivable: -$8,825.35\n- (Increase) in Inventory: -$5,903,060.00\n- Increase in Accounts Payable: $4,673,360.00\n- Increase in Tax Payable: $34,524.32\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities:\n$42,174.88 + $91,509.94 - $315,356.41 - $8,825.35 - $5,903,060.00 + $4,673,360.00 + $34,524.32 = -$1,385,672.62\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n\nFixed Assets (Initial): $8,000,000.00\nNo additional purchases of fixed assets were recorded.\n\nNet Cash Flow from Investing Activities: $0.00\n\n## Step 5: Calculate Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nBeginning Balance (from initial deposits):\nCash deposit: $3,000,000.00\nBank deposit: $5,000,000.00\nTotal: $8,000,000.00\n\nNet decrease in cash: -$1,385,672.62\n\nEnding Balance: $8,000,000.00 - $1,385,672.62 = $6,614,327.38\n\n## Final Cash Flow Statement:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Net Profit\": \"42174.88\",\n    \"Depreciation\": \"91509.94\",\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-315356.41\",\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-8825.35\",\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-5903060.00\",\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"4673360.00\",\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"34524.32\",\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-1385672.62\",\n    \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Ending Balance\": \"6614327.38\",\n    \"Net Increase\": \"-1385672.62\"\n}}\n```",
