January 1, 2024: Depreciation20240101001 - Amount: 45754.08\n2. February 1, 2024: Depreciation20240201002 - Amount: 45755.86\n\nSince I need to calculate the \"final\" depreciation item in the income statement, I should examine which of these represents the final depreciation amount.\n\nFor an income statement, we typically include all expenses within the reporting period. Looking at the data, most transactions run from December 31, 2023 through January 31, 2024, suggesting this is a one-month reporting period.\n\nThe February 1, 2024 depreciation would fall outside this period and would be part of the next month's statement. Therefore, the January 1, 2024 depreciation of 45754.08 would be the final depreciation amount for the January income statement.\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 45754.08\n\nActually, double-checking the value, I see the exact amount is 45754.08.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45754.08'} }\n```",
