Paid-in capital represents the funds that shareholders have invested in the company.\n\nFirst, I'll look for initial capital contributions by identifying initial deposit transactions from the beginning of the period.\n\nLooking at transactions labeled with \"Initial\" in the ID:\n\n```\n| Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 3000000.0 | 3000000.0 |\n| Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0 |\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 8000000.0 | 8000000.0 |\n```\n\nThese transactions represent the initial capital of the company. Let's sum them up:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.00\n\nTotal initial paid-in capital: 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 8,000,000.00 = 16,000,000.00\n\nNext, I need to check if there were any additional capital contributions or withdrawals during the period that would affect paid-in capital.\n\nLooking through the transaction data, I don't see any transactions labeled as:\n- Additional capital contributions\n- New stock issuances\n- Capital withdrawals\n- Treasury stock purchases\n- Other equity-related transactions\n\nIn the absence of such transactions, the paid-in capital remains constant from the beginning to the end of the reporting period.\n\nTherefore:\n- Initial Paid-in Capital: 16,000,000.00\n- Final Paid-in Capital: 16,000,000.00\n\nThe values remain the same as no additional capital was invested and no capital was withdrawn during the period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '16000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '16000000.00'} }\n```",
