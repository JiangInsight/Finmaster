Identify all tax-related transactions\n2. Calculate the total tax recognized (from sales)\n3. Determine if any tax payments were made\n4. Calculate the net increase or decrease in tax payable\n\nStep 1: Let's identify all sales transactions that include tax amounts.\n\nLooking through the data, I can see that the \"tax_amount\" column in sale transactions represents the tax collected on each sale. I'll sum up all tax amounts from all sales transactions.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total tax recognized (collected from customers).\n\nGoing through all sale transactions from January 2024 to February 2024, I'll add up all values in the \"tax_amount\" column:\n\nTotal tax recognized from sales:\n- Sale20240102001: 940.95\n- Sale20240102002: 866.46\n- Sale20240103003: 983.22\n- Sale20240103004: 639.49\n- Sale20240103005: 92.81\n...and so on for all sales transactions.\n\nAdding all tax amounts from all sales transactions, the total comes to: 57,713.11\n\nStep 3: Check if there were any direct tax payments to tax authorities.\n\nLooking through the transactions, I don't see any specific tax payment transactions (there are no entries categorized as \"Tax Payment\" or similar).\n\nStep 4: Calculate the increase in tax payable.\n\nSince there were no tax payments made during the period, the entire amount of tax collected represents an increase in tax payable. The business has collected tax from customers but has not yet remitted it to the tax authorities.\n\nTherefore, the increase in tax payable is: 57,713.11\n\nTo verify this is the correct approach, I can check if this amount appears reasonable compared to the total sales. The total tax is approximately 5% of the sales amounts, which seems reasonable for a standard sales tax or VAT rate.\n\nI'll now look for any other tax-related transactions that might affect the tax payable balance, such as tax refunds or adjustments, but I don't see any such entries in the data.\n\nThe final tax payable item in the cash flow statement is 57,713.11, representing an increase in tax payable liability.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '57713.11'} }\n```",
