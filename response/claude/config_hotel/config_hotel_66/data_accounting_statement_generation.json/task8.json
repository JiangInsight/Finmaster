Looking for transactions labeled as \"Depreciation\":\n   - January 1, 2024: Depreciation20240101001 for 45,754.08\n   - February 1, 2024: Depreciation20240201002 for 45,755.86\n\nFor the accumulated depreciation calculation:\n\n1. Initial value (as of December 31, 2023):\n   - There are no depreciation entries prior to January 1, 2024\n   - Therefore, the initial accumulated depreciation is 0.00\n\n2. End value (as of January 31, 2024):\n   - This should include all depreciation recorded during January\n   - Only the January 1 depreciation of 45,754.08 is applicable\n   - The February 1 depreciation occurs after our reporting period, so it's not included\n\nTherefore:\n- Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value: 0.00\n- Accumulated Depreciation End Value: 45,754.08\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accumulated Depreciation End Value': '45754.08'}}\n```",
