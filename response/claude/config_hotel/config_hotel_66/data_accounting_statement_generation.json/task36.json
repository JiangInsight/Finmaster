This involves determining the difference between revenue and all expenses.\n\nFirst, I'll categorize the different transaction types and calculate the total for each:\n\n## Revenue (Sales)\nI need to sum up all the profit values from the \"Sale\" transactions.\n\nLooking through the data, all sales transactions have a \"Sale\" type and include a \"profit\" column, which represents the profit from each sale.\n\n## Expenses\nI'll need to sum up all expense transactions:\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Sales Expenses\n- Financial Expenses\n- Depreciation\n\n## Interest\nI need to sum up all Interest Receivables, which will count as income.\n\nLet me calculate each of these components:\n\n### Sales Profit\nI'll add up all profit values from \"Sale\" type transactions.\nSum of all profits from sales: 294,599.36\n\n### Administrative Expenses\nSum of all Administrative Expenses: 19,702.90\n\n### Sales Expenses\nSum of all Sales Expenses: 8,195.91\n\n### Financial Expenses\nSum of all Financial Expenses: 4,879.77\n\n### Depreciation\nSum of Depreciation: 45,754.08 + 45,755.86 = 91,509.94\n\n### Interest Receivables\nSum of all Interest Receivables: 8,962.14\n\n## Final Net Profit Calculation\nNet Profit = Sales Profit + Interest Receivables - Administrative Expenses - Sales Expenses - Financial Expenses - Depreciation\n\nNet Profit = 294,599.36 + 8,962.14 - 19,702.90 - 8,195.91 - 4,879.77 - 91,509.94\nNet Profit = 303,561.50 - 124,288.52\nNet Profit = 179,272.98\n\nTherefore, the final net profit for the given period is $179,272.98.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '179272.98'} }\n```",
