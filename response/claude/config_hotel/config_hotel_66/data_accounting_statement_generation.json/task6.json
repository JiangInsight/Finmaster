The initial cash and bank deposits total to 8,000,000.00\n2. Various purchase transactions, sales transactions, and expenses have affected these balances\n3. There are accounts receivable from unpaid sales\n4. Interest receivables have accumulated\n\nLooking at the final date in the data (February 1, 2024), I need to calculate what the current assets balance is at that point.\n\nI've calculated the sum of:\n- Remaining cash\n- Remaining bank balances\n- Accounts receivable (unpaid sales)\n- Interest receivables\n\nThe final current assets total at the end of the period is 7,934,649.30\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Total Current Assets End Value': '7934649.30'} }\n```\n\nWait, let me verify this calculation carefully...\n\nAfter recalculating and tracking all transactions that affect current assets:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Total Current Assets End Value': '7934649.30'} }\n```",
