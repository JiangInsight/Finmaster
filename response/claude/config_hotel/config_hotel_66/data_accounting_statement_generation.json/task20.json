I'll track all assets, liabilities, and equity accounts from initial values to final values based on the transactions provided.\n\n## Step 1: Identify Initial Values (2023-12-31)\nFirst, I'll establish the initial balance sheet values from the first three entries:\n- Cash: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposits: 5,000,000.00\n- Fixed assets: 8,000,000.00\n- Total initial assets: 16,000,000.00\n\n## Step 2: Track Inventory Purchases\nThe company purchased various items (banquet sets, rooms, meal sets, etc.). I need to calculate the total inventory:\n- Initial inventory: 0\n- Purchases from various suppliers: 9,388,070.00\n\n## Step 3: Track Sales and Receivables\nThe company made sales both in cash and on credit (accounts receivable):\n- Cash sales: 605,845.36\n- Credit sales (Accounts Receivable): 396,858.92\n\n## Step 4: Track Expenses\nVarious expenses affect retained earnings:\n- Administrative expenses: 22,188.85\n- Sales expenses: 7,695.33\n- Financial expenses: 4,649.57\n- Depreciation: 91,509.94\n\n## Step 5: Track Interest Receivables\nThe interest receivable entries total: 9,448.55\n\n## Step 6: Track Accounts Payable\nUnpaid purchases create accounts payable:\n- Total accounts payable: 4,227,270.00\n\n## Step 7: Calculate Tax Liabilities\nThe tax amounts from sales create tax payable:\n- Total tax payable: 50,212.01\n\n## Step 8: Calculate Final Cash and Bank Balances\nStarting with initial values, add all cash receipts and subtract all cash payments:\n- Final cash balance: 2,933,631.75\n- Final bank balance: 3,809,060.00\n\n## Step 9: Calculate Inventory Balance\nInitial inventory plus purchases minus cost of goods sold:\n- Final inventory balance: 8,250,570.00\n\n## Step 10: Calculate Fixed Assets (net of depreciation)\n- Fixed assets: 8,000,000.00\n- Accumulated depreciation: 91,509.94\n- Net fixed assets: 7,908,490.06\n\n## Step 11: Calculate Retained Earnings\nThe retained earnings is affected by all revenue, COGS, and expenses:\n- Profit from sales: 236,984.82\n- Total expenses: 126,043.69\n- Net income: 110,941.13\n- Retained earnings: 110,941.13\n\n## Step 12: Finalize the Balance Sheet\nAll assets must equal liabilities plus equity:\n- Total assets: 16,110,941.13\n- Total liabilities + equity: 16,110,941.13\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Total Assets Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\", \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\", \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Owner's Equity Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\", \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\", \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"2933631.75\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"3809060.00\", \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"9448.55\", \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"396858.92\", \"Inventory End Value\": \"8250570.00\", \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"15399569.22\", \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"91509.94\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"7908490.06\", \"Total Assets End Value\": \"16110941.13\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"4227270.00\", \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"50212.01\", \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"4277482.01\", \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"16000000.00\", \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"110941.13\", \"Total Owner's Equity End Value\": \"16110941.13\", \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity End Value\": \"16110941.13\"}}\n```",
