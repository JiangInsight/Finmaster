Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period\n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole\n\nLooking at the statement:\n- The total income from ordinary activities is represented by \"Total Revenue\" which is 863371.65\n- The carrying amount of inventories sold would be \"Cost of Goods Sold\" which is 562950.00\n- The costs of general management and administration would be \"Administrative Expenses\" which is 16809.11\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '863371.65', 'value2': '562950.00', 'value3': '16809.11'}}\n```",
