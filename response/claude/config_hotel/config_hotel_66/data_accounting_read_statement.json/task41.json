This is exactly what we're looking for, as \"Tax Payable\" represents tax accrued but not yet paid.\n\nA positive value in this line means there was an increase in the tax payable (more tax accrued than was paid), which is what the task is asking for.\n\nTherefore, the value for the increase in the amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid is 43168.61.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '43168.61'}}\n```",
