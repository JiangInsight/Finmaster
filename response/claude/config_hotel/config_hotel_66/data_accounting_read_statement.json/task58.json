The initial amounts (as of 2023-12-31) for cash-related accounts are:\n- Cash on Hand: 3000000.00\n- Bank Deposits: 5000000.00\nWhich totals 8000000.00\n\nBoth approaches confirm that the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period was 8000000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
