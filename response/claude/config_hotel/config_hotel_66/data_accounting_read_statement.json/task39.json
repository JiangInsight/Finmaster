In the operating activities section, I can see:\n\n```\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -7832820.00 | 2024-02-01\n```\n\nThis line shows the change in inventory during the period. The negative value indicates that inventory increased by $7,832,820.00 during the period.\n\nHowever, the task asks for the \"reduction\" in assets held for sale. Since the inventory increased (as indicated by the negative value for \"Decrease\"), there was no reduction. But since the question specifically asks for the value of reduction, I should provide the value that represents how inventory changed.\n\nThe value is -$7,832,820.00, which represents an increase in inventory rather than a reduction.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-7832820.00'}}\n```",
