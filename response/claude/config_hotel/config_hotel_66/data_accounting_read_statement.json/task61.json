Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\nFor the first item (costs to secure customer orders/deliver goods), this would typically be found in the Income Statement as \"Selling Expenses\" which represents costs associated with sales and marketing activities.\n\nLooking at the Income Statement, I can see:\n- Selling Expenses: 7553.67\n\nFor the second item (cash payments for property/equipment), this would be found in the Cash Flow Statement under investing activities.\n\nLooking at the Cash Flow Statement, I can see:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 0.00\n\nThese are the line items that match the requirements.\n\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '7553.67', 'value2': '0.00'}}",
