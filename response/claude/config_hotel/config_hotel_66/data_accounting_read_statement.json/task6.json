Fixed assets are typically property, plant, and equipment used in business operations.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Fixed Assets value: 8000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- End Fixed Assets value: 8000000.00 (as of 2024-02-01)\n\nNote that while the gross value of fixed assets remains the same, there is accumulated depreciation of 91509.94 at the end date. However, the task asks for the values of the tangible items themselves (not net of depreciation), so I'll use the Fixed Assets line item values.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
