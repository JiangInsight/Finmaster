The net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\n## Step 1: Find interest accrued but not yet received\nLooking at the balance sheet, I find \"Interest Receivable\" with an end amount of 9066.78. This represents interest that has accrued but hasn't been received yet.\n\n## Step 2: Find net addition in cash and cash equivalents\nLooking at the cash flow statement, I find \"Net Increase\" with a value of -2419019.09. This represents the net change in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\n## Step 3: Extract the values\n- Interest accrued but not yet received: 9066.78\n- Net addition in cash and cash equivalents: -2419019.09\n\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '9066.78', 'value2': '-2419019.09'}}",
