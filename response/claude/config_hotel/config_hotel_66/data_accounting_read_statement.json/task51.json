In the balance sheet, there's a line item \"Interest Receivable\" which represents interest that has been earned but not yet received:\n   - Initial amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n   - End amount: 9066.78 (as of 2024-02-01)\n\n2. This is confirmed in the cash flow statement, which shows \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" of -9066.78, indicating an increase in interest receivable.\n\n3. The income statement shows \"Interest Income\" of 9066.78, which matches the interest receivable amount. This represents interest that has been recognized as income but not necessarily received in cash yet.\n\nSince \"Interest Receivable\" directly represents interest that has accrued but not yet been received, the values are:\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- End value: 9066.78\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '9066.78'} }\n```",
