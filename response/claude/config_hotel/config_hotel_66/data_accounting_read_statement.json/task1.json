In accounting, this typically refers to \"Cash on Hand\" and sometimes \"Bank Deposits\" as these are immediately accessible.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet:\n\n1. \"Cash on Hand\" shows:\n   - Initial amount: 3,000,000.00 on 2023-12-31\n   - End amount: 2,882,590.91 on 2024-02-01\n\n2. \"Bank Deposits\" shows:\n   - Initial amount: 5,000,000.00 on 2023-12-31\n   - End amount: 2,698,390.00 on 2024-02-01\n\nBased on the example solution provided, it seems the task is asking specifically for \"Cash on Hand\" which is the most liquid form of cash available for immediate use in operations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"3000000.00\", \"end value\": \"2882590.91\"}}\n```",
