In the statement, I see \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with a value of 5472810.00.\n\nFor value2, I need to find the line item for acquisition of property, plant and equipment. This is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of 0.00.\n\nFor value3, I need to find the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period. This is the \"Beginning Balance\" with a value of 8000000.00.\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5472810.00', 'value2': '0.00', 'value3': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
