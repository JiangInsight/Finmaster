The net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities (from Cash Flow Statement)\n2. The taxes accrued but not yet paid (from Balance Sheet)\n3. Total income/revenue from ordinary activities (from Income Statement)\n\nLet me analyze each statement:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- \"Taxes Payable\" represents taxes accrued but not yet paid: 43168.61\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- \"Total Revenue\" represents total income from ordinary activities: 863371.65\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" shows the net cash generated from principal revenue-producing activities: -2419019.09\n\nTherefore, the three values are:\n1. value1 (taxes accrued but not yet paid): 43168.61\n2. value2 (total income from ordinary activities): 863371.65\n3. value3 (net cash from operating activities): -2419019.09\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '43168.61', 'value2': '863371.65', 'value3': '-2419019.09'}}\n```",
