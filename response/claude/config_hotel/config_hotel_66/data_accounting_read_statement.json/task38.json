When it increases (shown as a negative number in this format), it means more goods/services were sold on credit.\n\nIn this cash flow statement, I can see:\n- \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with a value of \"-330748.44\"\n\nThe negative sign indicates this is actually an increase in accounts receivable, not a decrease. However, the task asks for the decrease in amounts owed, which would be represented by this line item.\n\nTherefore, the value for the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit is \"-330748.44\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-330748.44'}}\n```",
