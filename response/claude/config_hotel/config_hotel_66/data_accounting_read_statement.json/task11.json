The initial value (as of 2023-12-31) is listed as 0.00\n3. The end value (as of 2024-02-01) is listed as 146127.58\n\nThis shows that the company started with no retained earnings and ended the period with $146,127.58 in retained earnings, meaning the company generated this profit during the period and kept it in the business rather than distributing it to shareholders.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '146127.58'}}\n```",
