I see in row 3 the invoice states \"totaling $5000000.00\" but the recorded amount is 8,000,000.\n\nFor \"Purchase20231231020\", the recorded_preparer field is missing/None, but the invoice clearly states \"This transaction was prepared by Executive Director\".\n\nFor \"Expense20240125001\", looking at the Administrative Expenses entry with amount 19122.72, the recorded_preparer is empty/None, but the invoice states \"This transaction was prepared by Staff\".\n\nBased on my analysis, I've found these inconsistencies that need to be corrected:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': None, 'Recorded category': None, 'Original date': None, 'Recorded date': None, 'Original payment/receipt_status': None, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': None, 'Original payment_method': None, 'Recorded payment_method': None, 'Original quantity': None, 'Recorded quantity': None, 'Original price': None, 'Recorded price': None, 'Original receive_method': None, 'Recorded receive_method': None, 'Original amount': None, 'Recorded amount': None, 'Original tax': None, 'Recorded tax': None, 'Original profit': None, 'Recorded profit': None, 'Original Preparer': 'Executive Director', 'Recorded Preparer': 'None', 'Original Approver': None, 'Recorded Approver': None, 'id': 'Purchase20231231020'} }",
