The recorded amounts vs calculated amounts (price Ã— quantity)\n2. The recorded unit prices vs what's stated in the invoice\n3. Any discrepancies in tax calculations or profit calculations\n4. Any other inconsistencies between structured data and invoice text\n\nFor Sale20240119059, I notice a discrepancy:\n- The recorded amount is $2963.60\n- The recorded unit price is $1430.96 for 2 units, which would total $2861.92\n- In the invoice, the unit price is stated as $1336.53, which would total $2673.06\n- The invoice also states a total of $2673.06, not $2963.60\n\nThis is a clear inconsistency where both the recorded price and total amount don't match what's in the invoice description.\n\nI didn't find other clear inconsistencies in the data where the recorded information contradicts the invoice text. The invoice field is generally considered more reliable as mentioned in the task description.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original price\": \"1336.53\", \"Recorded price\": \"1430.96\", \"Original amount\": \"2673.06\", \"Recorded amount\": \"2963.60\", \"id\": \"Sale20240119059\"}}\n```",
