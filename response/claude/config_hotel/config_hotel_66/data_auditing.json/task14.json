The recorded quantity is 4.0 units, but the invoice text mentions 5.0 units:\n   - Invoice: \"consisting of 5.0 units at a unit price of $3295.01, totaling $16475.05\"\n   - Recorded amount: $13180.04 (which doesn't match the invoice's total)\n\n2. The recorded payment/receipt status is \"Unpaid\", but the invoice text says it was \"paid\":\n   - Invoice: \"The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n   - Recorded status: \"Unpaid\"\n\nLet me verify this discrepancy further by checking the math:\n- 5 units × $3295.01 = $16,475.05 (this matches the invoice's stated total)\n- With tax amount of $823.75, the after-tax amount should be $15,651.30 (this also matches the invoice)\n\nThe recorded amount of $13,180.04 would be consistent with 4 units (4 × $3295.01 = $13,180.04), but this contradicts the invoice text.\n\nSince the invoice is considered more reliable, I conclude that:\n1. The correct quantity should be 5.0 units, not 4.0\n2. The correct payment/receipt status should be \"Paid\", not \"Unpaid\"\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"5.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"4.0\", \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"16475.05\", \"Recorded amount\": \"13180.04\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240123071\"}}\n```",
