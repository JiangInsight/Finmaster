The recorded amount doesn't match the invoice amount, and the payment status is also incorrect.\n\nLet me check if there are any other inconsistencies...\n\nI don't see any other inconsistencies in the data. The remaining transactions appear to have consistent information between the recorded fields and the invoice description.\n\nTherefore, the only inconsistent transaction is Expense20240121001, where both the amount and payment status are incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"981.16\", \"Recorded amount\": \"1146.24\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Expense20240121001\"}}\n```",
