Also, the recorded amount is $312.40 but the invoice states $276.34.\n\n## Other transactions\nLooking at Sales, Interest, and Depreciation transactions:\n- The recorded values generally match the invoice descriptions\n- No obvious inconsistencies in date format or calculation errors\n\nThe most significant inconsistency I found is in Expense20240115001, where both the transaction type and amount don't match what's in the invoice.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Administrative Expenses', 'Recorded category': 'Purchase', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '276.34', 'Recorded amount': '312.4', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240115001'} }\n```",
