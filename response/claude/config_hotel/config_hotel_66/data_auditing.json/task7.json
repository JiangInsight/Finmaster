First, I'll check all Interest Receivables entries for the spelling of \"receive_method\":\n   - In all Interest Receivables entries, the recorded_receive_method is \"Interest receviable\"\n   - But checking the invoice text, this seems to be consistently spelled as \"interest receviable\"\n   - This is a spelling issue but consistent throughout\n\n2. Looking at Sale20240201103:\n   - According to the invoice text: \"The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n   - But the recorded_receive_method is \"Account Receivable\"\n   - This is a clear inconsistency between the invoice (more reliable) and the recorded value\n\n3. Initial20231231001 shows Fixed Assets for 8000000.0, but there are three entries with this ID showing different types/amounts.\n\n4. Checking all other recorded values against invoice descriptions:\n   - For most Sale entries, payment methods, amounts, and other details match the invoice description\n   - No other clear inconsistencies found\n\nFor the Interest Receivables, I originally considered flagging them all, but this appears to be a consistent spelling difference across all entries, not a data consistency error. The real data inconsistency is in Sale20240201103 where the receive_method doesn't match what's stated in the invoice.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Account Receivable\", \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240201103\"} }\n```",
