The cost amount for this transaction was $8640.00, with a tax amount of $704.22, leading to a total amount due of $13380.24. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nComparing with recorded values:\n- Date: Recorded as \"2024-01-23\" but invoice says \"January 06, 2024\"\n- Quantity: Recorded as \"2.0\" but invoice says \"3.0 units\"\n- Unit price: Recorded as \"$5592.03\" but invoice says \"$4694.82\"\n- Total amount: Recorded as \"$9389.64\" but invoice says \"totaling $14084.46\"\n\nLet me validate the calculations:\n- Invoice calculation: 3.0 units × $4694.82 = $14084.46 ✓\n- Recorded calculation: 2.0 units × $5592.03 = $11184.06 (doesn't match recorded amount of $9389.64)\n\nThere are multiple inconsistencies in this transaction. The invoice information is more reliable, so I should use those values as the correct ones.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-06', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-23', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '3.0', 'Recorded quantity': '2.0', 'Original price': '4694.82', 'Recorded price': '5592.03', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '14084.46', 'Recorded amount': '9389.64', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240106012'} }\n```",
