Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\nThis ratio compares net cash flow from operating activities to net income.\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -2,419,019.09\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = 146,127.58\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = -2,419,019.09 รท 146,127.58 = -16.55\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate revenue.\n\n- Total Revenue = 863,371.65\n- Total Current Assets = 13,753,616.13\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = 863,371.65 รท 13,753,616.13 = 0.06\n\n### 3. Quick Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n\n- Total Current Assets = 13,753,616.13\n- Inventory = 7,832,820.00\n- Quick Assets (Current Assets - Inventory) = 13,753,616.13 - 7,832,820.00 = 5,920,796.13\n- Total Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n\nQuick Ratio = 5,920,796.13 รท 5,515,978.61 = 1.07\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-16.55\", \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.06\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.07\"}}\n```",
