                        "content": "I need to calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio, which measures how efficiently a company collects credit extended to customers. The formula is:\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nStep 1: Identify Net Credit Sales.\nFrom the income statement, we have Main Business Revenue = $863,371.65, which represents sales. Since we don't have information distinguishing between cash and credit sales, I'll use the total revenue as Net Credit Sales.\n\nStep 2: Calculate Average Accounts Receivable.\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable (from Initial_amount): $0.00\n- Ending Accounts Receivable (from End_amount): $330,748.44\n- Average Accounts Receivable = ($0.00 + $330,748.44) / 2 = $165,374.22\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio.\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $863,371.65 / $165,374.22 = 5.22\n\nStep 4: Round to two decimal places.\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 5.22\n\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '5.22'}}",
