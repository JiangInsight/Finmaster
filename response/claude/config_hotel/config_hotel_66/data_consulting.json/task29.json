                        "content": "I need to calculate several financial ratios based on the three financial statements provided. Let me take a systematic approach to each ratio.\n\n## 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio measures the company's financial leverage by comparing total liabilities to shareholders' equity.\n\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities = $5,515,978.61 (from end balance sheet)\n- Total Equity = $16,146,127.58 (from end balance sheet)\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $5,515,978.61 / $16,146,127.58 = 0.342\n\n## 2. Net Profit Margin\nThis ratio measures how much of each dollar of revenue is kept as net income.\n\nFormula: Net Profit / Total Revenue × 100%\n\n- Net Profit = $146,127.58 (from income statement)\n- Total Revenue = $863,371.65 (from income statement)\n\nNet Profit Margin = ($146,127.58 / $863,371.65) × 100% = 16.93%\n\n## 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\nThis ratio shows how efficiently a company is using its assets to generate profit.\n\nFormula: Net Profit / Total Assets × 100%\n\n- Net Profit = $146,127.58 (from income statement)\n- Total Assets = $21,662,106.19 (from end balance sheet)\n\nROA = ($146,127.58 / $21,662,106.19) × 100% = 0.67%\n\n## 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\n\nFormula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nSince we don't have beginning accounts receivable (it was $0), we'll use the ending value:\n- Net Credit Sales = $863,371.65 (assuming all sales are credit sales)\n- Average Accounts Receivable = $330,748.44 (ending value)\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $863,371.65 / $330,748.44 = 2.61\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.342', 'Net Profit Margin': '16.93%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '0.67%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.61'} }\n```",
