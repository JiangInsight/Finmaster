Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio shows the proportion of debt to equity used to finance the company's assets.\n\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = $5,515,978.61 (Total Current Liabilities)\n- Total Equity = $16,146,127.58 (Total Owner's Equity)\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $5,515,978.61 / $16,146,127.58 = 0.342\n\n## 2. Net Profit Margin\nThis ratio measures how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue.\n\nFormula: Net Profit / Total Revenue × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = $146,127.58\n- Total Revenue = $863,371.65\n\nNet Profit Margin = ($146,127.58 / $863,371.65) × 100% = 16.93%\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis ratio assesses a company's ability to pay its current liabilities from its operating cash flow.\n\nFormula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the financial statements:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$2,419,019.09\n- Total Current Liabilities = $5,515,978.61\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -$2,419,019.09 / $5,515,978.61 = -0.439\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.34', 'Net Profit Margin': '16.93%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.44'} }\n```",
