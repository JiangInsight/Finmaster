                        "content": "I'll solve this task by calculating the requested financial ratios step by step.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to cover current liabilities with operating cash flow.\n- Operating Cash Flow = -2,419,019.09\n- Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -2,419,019.09 / 5,515,978.61 = -0.44\n\n## 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nThis measures the company's ability to repay its debt using operating cash flow.\n- Operating Cash Flow = -2,419,019.09\n- Total Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -2,419,019.09 / 5,515,978.61 = -0.44\n\n## 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company sells its inventory.\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 562,950.00\n- Average Inventory = (0 + 7,832,820.00) / 2 = 3,916,410.00\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = 562,950.00 / 3,916,410.00 = 0.14\n\n## 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures how much debt a company is using to finance its assets relative to equity.\n- Total Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n- Total Equity = 16,146,127.58\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = 5,515,978.61 / 16,146,127.58 = 0.34\n\n## 5. Quick Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with quick assets.\n- Quick Assets = Cash + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable = 2,882,590.91 + 2,698,390.00 + 330,748.44 + 9,066.78 = 5,920,796.13\n- Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n- Quick Ratio = 5,920,796.13 / 5,515,978.61 = 1.07\n\n## 6. Current Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations.\n- Current Assets = 13,753,616.13\n- Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n- Current Ratio = 13,753,616.13 / 5,515,978.61 = 2.49\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.44', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.44', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.14', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.34', 'Quick Ratio': '1.07', 'Current Ratio': '2.49'} }\n```",
