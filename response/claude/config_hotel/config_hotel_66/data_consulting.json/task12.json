ROE is calculated as Net Profit divided by Average Shareholders' Equity, expressed as a percentage.\n\nStep 1: Identify the Net Profit from the income statement\n- Net Profit = $146,127.58\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Average Shareholders' Equity\n- Beginning Shareholders' Equity (Initial Total Owner's Equity) = $16,000,000.00\n- Ending Shareholders' Equity (End Total Owner's Equity) = $16,146,127.58\n- Average Shareholders' Equity = ($16,000,000.00 + $16,146,127.58) / 2 = $16,073,063.79\n\nStep 3: Calculate ROE\n- ROE = Net Profit / Average Shareholders' Equity\n- ROE = $146,127.58 / $16,073,063.79 = 0.00909 or 0.91%\n\nTherefore, the Return on Equity (ROE) for this period is 0.91%.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.91%'} }\n```",
