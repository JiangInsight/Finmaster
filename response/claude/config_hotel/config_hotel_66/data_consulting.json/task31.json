Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\nFormula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nSince we only have end balance for accounts receivable, I'll use that value:\n- Net Credit Sales = Main Business Revenue = $863,371.65\n- Accounts Receivable = $330,748.44\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $863,371.65 / $330,748.44 = 2.61\n\n## 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow generated from operations.\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\n- Operating Cash Flow = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$2,419,019.09\n- Current Liabilities = $5,515,978.61\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -$2,419,019.09 / $5,515,978.61 = -0.44\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio we just calculated = -0.44\n\n## 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\nFormula: Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\n- Net Sales = $863,371.65\n- Average Total Assets = (Initial Assets + End Assets) / 2 = ($16,000,000 + $21,662,106.19) / 2 = $18,831,053.10\n- Total Asset Turnover Ratio = $863,371.65 / $18,831,053.10 = 0.05\n\n## 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures a company's financial leverage.\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities = $5,515,978.61\n- Total Equity = $16,146,127.58\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = $5,515,978.61 / $16,146,127.58 = 0.34\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.61', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-0.44', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.44', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.05', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.34'}}\n```",
