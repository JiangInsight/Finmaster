Since there are no long-term liabilities shown, this represents the total debt.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio.\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -$2,419,019.09 / $5,515,978.61\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -0.4386 â‰ˆ -0.44\n\nTherefore, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is -0.44, which indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative and cannot cover its debt obligations.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.44'} }\n```",
