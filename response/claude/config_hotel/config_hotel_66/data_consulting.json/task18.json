Operating Cash Flow: From the cash flow statement, the \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" is -2,419,019.09\n2. Current Liabilities: From the balance sheet, the \"Total Current Liabilities\" at end date is 5,515,978.61\n\nNow I'll calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -2,419,019.09 / 5,515,978.61\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -0.4386 â‰ˆ -0.44\n\nThe negative ratio indicates that the company's operations are not generating enough cash to cover its current liabilities, which could be a concern for short-term liquidity.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.44'} }\n```",
