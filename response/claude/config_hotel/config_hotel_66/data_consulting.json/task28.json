Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Total Revenue\n3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nLet me calculate each one step by step:\n\n## 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $5,515,978.61\n- Total Assets = $21,662,106.19\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $5,515,978.61 / $21,662,106.19 = 0.2546 ≈ 0.25\n\n## 2. Gross Profit Margin\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = $300,421.65\n- Total Revenue = $863,371.65\n\nGross Profit Margin = $300,421.65 / $863,371.65 = 0.3479 = 34.79%\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nFrom the cash flow statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$2,419,019.09\n- Total Current Liabilities = $5,515,978.61\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$2,419,019.09 / $5,515,978.61 = -0.4386 ≈ -0.44\n\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.25', 'Gross Profit Margin': '34.79%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.44'}}",
