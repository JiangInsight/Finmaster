Return on Equity (ROE) = Net Profit / Total Owner's Equity\n   - Net Profit: $146,127.58 (from income statement)\n   - Total Owner's Equity: $16,146,127.58 (from balance sheet, end amount)\n   - ROE = $146,127.58 / $16,146,127.58 = 0.00905 = 0.905%\n\n2. Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n   - Total Liabilities: $5,515,978.61 (from balance sheet, end amount of Total Current Liabilities)\n   - Total Assets: $21,662,106.19 (from balance sheet, end amount)\n   - Debt to Asset Ratio = $5,515,978.61 / $21,662,106.19 = 0.2546 â‰ˆ 0.25\n\n3. Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Total Revenue\n   - Gross Profit: $300,421.65 (from income statement)\n   - Total Revenue: $863,371.65 (from income statement)\n   - Gross Profit Margin = $300,421.65 / $863,371.65 = 0.3479 = 34.79%\n\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.91%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.25', 'Gross Profit Margin': '34.79%'}}",
