The formula is:\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nStep 1: Identify the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities.\nFrom the cash flow statement, I can see that the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is -$2,419,019.09.\n\nStep 2: Identify the Total Current Liabilities.\nFrom the balance sheet, the Total Current Liabilities at the end date (2024-02-01) is $5,515,978.61.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the ratio.\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -$2,419,019.09 / $5,515,978.61 = -0.4386\n\nStep 4: Round to two decimal places.\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -0.44\n\nTherefore, the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities ratio is -0.44, which means the company's operating activities are generating negative cash flow and cannot cover its current liabilities.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.44'} }\n```",
