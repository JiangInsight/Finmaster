                        "content": "I need to calculate the Total Asset Turnover Ratio, which measures how efficiently a company is using its assets to generate revenue.\n\nThe formula for Total Asset Turnover Ratio is:\nTotal Asset Turnover = Net Sales (Revenue) / Average Total Assets\n\nLet me gather the necessary information:\n\n1. Net Sales (Revenue): From the income statement, the Total Revenue is $863,371.65\n\n2. Average Total Assets: This is the average of beginning and ending total assets\n   - Beginning Total Assets (2023-12-31): $16,000,000.00\n   - Ending Total Assets (2024-02-01): $21,662,106.19\n   - Average Total Assets = ($16,000,000.00 + $21,662,106.19) / 2 = $18,831,053.10\n\n3. Calculate Total Asset Turnover Ratio:\n   Total Asset Turnover Ratio = $863,371.65 / $18,831,053.10 = 0.0458\n\nTherefore, the Total Asset Turnover Ratio for this period is 0.05 (rounded to 2 decimal places).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.05'} }\n```",
