Current Assets (as of 2024-02-01): $13,753,616.13\n2. Inventory (as of 2024-02-01): $7,832,820.00\n3. Current Liabilities (as of 2024-02-01): $5,515,978.61\n\nNow I'll calculate the Quick Ratio:\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\nQuick Ratio = ($13,753,616.13 - $7,832,820.00) / $5,515,978.61\nQuick Ratio = $5,920,796.13 / $5,515,978.61\nQuick Ratio = 1.0734\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: 1.07\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '1.07'}}\n```",
