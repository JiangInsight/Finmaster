The Debt to Equity Ratio is calculated by dividing the total liabilities by the total shareholders' equity.\n\nFrom the balance sheet as of 2024-02-01:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $5,515,978.61\n- Total Owner's Equity = $16,146,127.58\n\nNow I'll calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $5,515,978.61 / $16,146,127.58\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 0.34163 (rounded to 2 decimal places: 0.34)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.34'}}\n```",
