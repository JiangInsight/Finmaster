The formula for ROA is:\n\nROA = Net Income / Average Total Assets\n\nLet's gather the required information:\n\n1. Net Income: From the income statement, the Net Profit is $146,127.58\n\n2. Average Total Assets: This is calculated as (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2\n   - Beginning Total Assets (2023-12-31): $16,000,000.00\n   - Ending Total Assets (2024-02-01): $21,662,106.19\n   - Average Total Assets = ($16,000,000.00 + $21,662,106.19) / 2 = $18,831,053.10\n\nNow I'll calculate the ROA:\nROA = $146,127.58 / $18,831,053.10 = 0.007761 or 0.78%\n\nTherefore, the Return on Assets (ROA) is 0.78%.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Assets (ROA)': '0.78%'} }\n```",
