It's calculated as:\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nStep 1: Find the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\nFrom the income statement, COGS = $562,950.00\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Average Inventory\n- Beginning Inventory (from initial balance sheet): $0.00\n- Ending Inventory (from end balance sheet): $7,832,820.00\n- Average Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2\n- Average Inventory = ($0.00 + $7,832,820.00) / 2 = $3,916,410.00\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio\nInventory Turnover Ratio = COGS / Average Inventory\nInventory Turnover Ratio = $562,950.00 / $3,916,410.00 = 0.144\n\nStep 4: Round to 2 decimal places\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 0.14\n\nTherefore, the inventory turnover ratio is 0.14, indicating that the company turned over its inventory 0.14 times during the reporting period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.14'} }\n```",
