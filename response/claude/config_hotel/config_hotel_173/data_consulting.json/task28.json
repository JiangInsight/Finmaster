Debt to Asset Ratio\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated as: Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $3,376,304.04\n- Total Assets = $19,520,226.07\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $3,376,304.04 / $19,520,226.07 = 0.173\n\n## 2. Gross Profit Margin\nThe Gross Profit Margin is calculated as: (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = $308,309.79\n- Total Revenue = $851,679.79\n\nGross Profit Margin = ($308,309.79 / $851,679.79) × 100% = 36.20%\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThe Operating Cash Flow Ratio is calculated as: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$4,510,837.08\n- Total Current Liabilities = $3,376,304.04\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$4,510,837.08 / $3,376,304.04 = -1.34\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.17', 'Gross Profit Margin': '36.20%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.34'} }\n```",
