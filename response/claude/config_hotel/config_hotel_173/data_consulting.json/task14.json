                        "content": "I need to calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio for this company. This ratio measures how efficiently a company collects credit sales from customers.\n\nThe formula for Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is:\nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nStep 1: Identify the Net Credit Sales.\nFrom the income statement, the Main Business Revenue (which represents sales) is $851,679.79.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Average Accounts Receivable.\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable (from initial balance sheet): $0.00\n- Ending Accounts Receivable (from end balance sheet): $335,967.05\n- Average Accounts Receivable = ($0.00 + $335,967.05) / 2 = $167,983.53\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio.\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $851,679.79 / $167,983.53 = 5.07\n\nTherefore, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is 5.07, which I'll round to two decimal places.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '5.07'} }\n```",
