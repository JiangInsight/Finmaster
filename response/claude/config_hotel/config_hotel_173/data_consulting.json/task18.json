First, I need to understand that the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is calculated by dividing the Operating Cash Flow by Current Liabilities.\n\n2. From the cash flow statement, I can see that the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is -4,510,837.08.\n\n3. From the balance sheet, I can see that the Total Current Liabilities is 3,376,304.04.\n\n4. Now I'll calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\n   Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n   Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -4,510,837.08 / 3,376,304.04\n   Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -1.33603... â‰ˆ -1.34\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is -1.34.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.34'} }\n```",
