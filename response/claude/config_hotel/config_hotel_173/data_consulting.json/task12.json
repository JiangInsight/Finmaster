                        "content": "I'll calculate the Return on Equity (ROE) for this company based on the financial statements provided.\n\nROE measures how efficiently a company uses its equity to generate profits. The formula for ROE is:\n\nROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity\n\nLooking at the financial statements:\n\n1. Net Income (from income statement): $143,922.03\n2. Initial Shareholders' Equity (from balance sheet): $16,000,000.00\n3. Ending Shareholders' Equity (from balance sheet): $16,143,922.03\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the average shareholders' equity:\nAverage Shareholders' Equity = (Initial + Ending)/2\nAverage Shareholders' Equity = ($16,000,000.00 + $16,143,922.03)/2\nAverage Shareholders' Equity = $16,071,961.02\n\nNow I can calculate ROE:\nROE = $143,922.03 / $16,071,961.02\nROE = 0.00896 or 0.896%\n\nTherefore, the Return on Equity (ROE) is 0.90% (rounded to two decimal places).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.90%'} }\n```",
