                        "content": "I need to calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio for this company based on the financial statements provided.\n\nThe Inventory Turnover Ratio is calculated as:\nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory\n\nLet's gather the required information:\n\n1. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): From the income statement, COGS = $543,370.00\n\n2. Average Inventory: I need the beginning and ending inventory values\n   - Beginning Inventory (from initial balance sheet): $0.00\n   - Ending Inventory (from ending balance sheet): $7,783,800.00\n   - Average Inventory = ($0.00 + $7,783,800.00) / 2 = $3,891,900.00\n\nNow I can calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio:\nInventory Turnover Ratio = $543,370.00 / $3,891,900.00 = 0.1396 or approximately 0.14\n\nThis means the company has turned over its inventory 0.14 times during the period. This is a relatively low ratio, but it could be explained by the fact that the company just started building inventory (starting from $0) and the period might be short (approximately one month from Dec 31, 2023 to Feb 4, 2024).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.14'} }\n```",
