                        "content": "I'll calculate the five financial ratios based on the provided financial statements. Let me work through each one step by step.\n\n## Current Ratio\nThe Current Ratio is calculated as Current Assets divided by Current Liabilities.\n- Current Assets = $11,364,912.39\n- Current Liabilities = $3,376,304.04\n- Current Ratio = $11,364,912.39 / $3,376,304.04 = 3.37\n\n## Quick Ratio\nThe Quick Ratio is calculated as (Current Assets - Inventory) divided by Current Liabilities.\n- Current Assets = $11,364,912.39\n- Inventory = $7,783,800.00\n- Current Liabilities = $3,376,304.04\n- Quick Ratio = ($11,364,912.39 - $7,783,800.00) / $3,376,304.04 = $3,581,112.39 / $3,376,304.04 = 1.06\n\n## Debt to Asset Ratio\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated as Total Liabilities divided by Total Assets.\n- Total Liabilities = $3,376,304.04\n- Total Assets = $19,520,226.07\n- Debt to Asset Ratio = $3,376,304.04 / $19,520,226.07 = 0.17\n\n## Debt to Equity Ratio\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio is calculated as Total Liabilities divided by Total Owner's Equity.\n- Total Liabilities = $3,376,304.04\n- Total Owner's Equity = $16,143,922.03\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = $3,376,304.04 / $16,143,922.03 = 0.21\n\n## Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nThe Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is calculated as Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities divided by Total Liabilities.\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$4,510,837.08\n- Total Liabilities = $3,376,304.04\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -$4,510,837.08 / $3,376,304.04 = -1.34\n\nNow I'll present these results in the required format, rounding to 2 decimal places:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '3.37', 'Quick Ratio': '1.06', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.17', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.34'}}\n```",
