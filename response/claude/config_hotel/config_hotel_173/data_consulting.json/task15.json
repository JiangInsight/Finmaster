This ratio measures how efficiently a company is using its current assets to generate sales.\n\nThe formula for Current Assets Turnover Ratio is:\nNet Sales (Revenue) / Average Current Assets\n\nStep 1: Find the Net Sales (Revenue) from the income statement.\nNet Sales = $851,679.79\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Average Current Assets.\nBeginning Current Assets (Initial) = $8,000,000.00\nEnding Current Assets = $11,364,912.39\nAverage Current Assets = ($8,000,000.00 + $11,364,912.39) / 2 = $9,682,456.20\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Current Assets Turnover Ratio.\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = $851,679.79 / $9,682,456.20 = 0.088\n\nStep 4: Round to 2 decimal places:\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = 0.09\n\nThis low ratio indicates that the company is not generating much revenue relative to its current assets, suggesting potential inefficiency in the use of current assets.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.09'}}",
