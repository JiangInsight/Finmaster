Calculate Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nThis ratio measures the relationship between a company's operating cash flow and its net income.\n\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities ÷ Net Profit\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,510,837.08\n- Net Profit = 143,922.03\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = -4,510,837.08 ÷ 143,922.03 = -31.34\n\n## 2. Calculate Current Assets Turnover Ratio (Turnover Ratio)\n\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company is using its current assets to generate revenue.\n\nFormula: Current Assets Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue ÷ Total Current Assets\n\nFrom the income statement and balance sheet:\n- Total Revenue = 851,679.79\n- Total Current Assets (end of period) = 11,364,912.39\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = 851,679.79 ÷ 11,364,912.39 = 0.07\n\n## 3. Calculate Quick Ratio\n\nThe quick ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n\nFormula: Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = 11,364,912.39\n- Inventory = 7,783,800.00\n- Current Liabilities = 3,376,304.04\n\nQuick Ratio = (11,364,912.39 - 7,783,800.00) ÷ 3,376,304.04 = 3,581,112.39 ÷ 3,376,304.04 = 1.06\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-31.34', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.07', 'Quick Ratio': '1.06'} }\n```",
