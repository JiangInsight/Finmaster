Cash deposit: $3,000,000\n2. Bank deposit: $5,000,000\n3. Fixed Assets: $8,000,000 (should be $5,000,000 based on the invoice description)\n\nThis suggests a potential issue with the third entry, but having multiple entries with the same ID might be intentional for initial balance entries.\n\n## Sale20240127079\nLet me check this transaction:\n- The recorded date is \"2024-02-05\"\n- But the invoice states \"On January 27, 2024, an invoice was issued...\"\n- The unit price in the invoice text is $2046.52\n- But the recorded_unit_price field shows $2130.44\n\nThis is clearly an inconsistency as both the date and the price don't match between the invoice description and the recorded fields.\n\nLooking through the other entries, no other clear inconsistencies appear to be present based on comparing the fields against the invoice descriptions.\n\nTherefore, I'll focus on the identified issue with Sale20240127079:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-27', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-05', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '2046.52', 'Recorded price': '2130.44', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240127079'} }\n```",
