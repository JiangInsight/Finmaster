No inconsistencies.\n\n## Sale20240201093\nLooking at this entry:\n- Recorded tax amount: 11035.17\n- Invoice says: \"...with a tax amount of $487.31...\"\n\nThis is a clear inconsistency. The recorded tax amount (11035.17) is much higher than what's stated in the invoice (487.31). The invoice is considered more reliable due to its standardized nature.\n\nLet me check other fields in this transaction to be thorough:\n- The total amount (9746.16) appears correct\n- Cost amount (6000.0) matches the invoice\n- Profit (3746.16) appears correct\n- The after-tax amount (9258.85) matches the invoice\n\nThe tax amount is the only field that appears inconsistent.\n\n## Looking for other inconsistencies\nI don't see any other clear inconsistencies where the recorded values differ from what's stated in the invoice. The amounts, dates, payment statuses, etc. all appear to match between the recorded fields and the invoice descriptions.\n\nTherefore, the only inconsistency I've identified is in the tax amount for transaction Sale20240201093.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': '487.31', 'Recorded tax': '11035.17', 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240201093'} }\n```",
