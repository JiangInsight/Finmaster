The recorded date is `2024-03-01` but the invoice says `On January 31, 2024`\n2. The recorded amount is `738.89` but the invoice mentions `totaling $594.97`\n3. The recorded tax amount is `657.46` but the invoice says `with a tax amount of $29.75`\n4. The recorded unit price is `537.14` but the invoice states `at a unit price of $594.97`\n\nLet me verify the consistency with other calculated fields:\n- The profit should be: Sale amount - Cost amount = $594.97 - $350.00 = $244.97 (matches invoice)\n- The after-tax amount should be: Sale amount - Tax amount = $594.97 - $29.75 = $565.22 (matches invoice)\n\nThis confirms that the information in the invoice is internally consistent, while the recorded values are inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-31', 'Recorded date': '2024-03-01', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '594.97', 'Recorded price': '537.14', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '594.97', 'Recorded amount': '738.89', 'Original tax': '29.75', 'Recorded tax': '657.46', 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240131090'} }\n```",
