It's labeled as \"Depreciation\" in the recorded_type, but the invoice description indicates it's a \"Sale\" transaction. Additionally, the invoice date (January 09, 2024) doesn't match the recorded_date (January 28, 2024).\n\nWhen checking the invoice text against other fields, I can confirm:\n- The invoice clearly states \"January 09, 2024\" as the date\n- The invoice describes a sale transaction with unit price, quantity, etc.\n- The transaction type is incorrectly recorded as \"Depreciation\" instead of \"Sale\"\n\nThis is a significant inconsistency since the transaction type and date don't match the invoice information, which is considered more reliable according to the task description.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Depreciation\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-09\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-28\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"5.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"5.0\", \"Original price\": \"3088.33\", \"Recorded price\": \"3088.33\", \"Original receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\", \"Original amount\": \"15441.65\", \"Recorded amount\": \"15441.65\", \"Original tax\": \"772.08\", \"Recorded tax\": \"772.08\", \"Original profit\": \"5441.65\", \"Recorded profit\": \"5441.65\", \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240109020\"}}\n```",
