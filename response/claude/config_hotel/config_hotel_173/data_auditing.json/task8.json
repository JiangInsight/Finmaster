For transaction `Initial20231231001` with \"Fixed Assets\" type, I notice:\n   - Recorded amount: $8000000.0\n   - Invoice amount: $5000000.00 for one Fixed Assets entry\n   - There appears to be a mismatch here\n\n2. For transaction `Interest20240117017`:\n   - Recorded amount: $215.24\n   - Invoice amount: $183.68\n   - The invoice clearly states \"totaling $183.68\" but the recorded amount is different\n\n3. Let me check the sale transaction `Sale20240110016`:\n   - Comparing the invoice details:\n     - Invoice shows \"totaling $124688.16\" with cost amount $100000.00\n     - But recorded amount is $138369.24\n     - This is a clear discrepancy\n\nLooking at all the data, these are the clear inconsistencies I've found where the recorded values don't match what's stated in the invoice text.\n\nBased on my analysis, here's the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '124688.16', 'Recorded amount': '138369.24', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': '24688.16', 'Recorded profit': '33587.28', 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240110016'} }\n```",
