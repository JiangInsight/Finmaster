Looking at the invoice field:\n- First row: Cash deposit of $3,000,000\n- Second row: Bank deposit of $5,000,000\n- Third row: Fixed Assets of $8,000,000\nThese appear to be initial setup entries, and I don't see inconsistencies between the recorded values and invoice details.\n\n## Analyzing transaction ID: Sale20240105009\nThis transaction shows a mismatch:\n- Recorded type: \"Financial Expenses\"\n- Invoice description starts with: \"On January 05, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale\"\n- The invoice indicates this should be a \"Sale\" transaction\n\nChecking further details:\n- Recorded amount: $977.85\n- But invoice states: \"totaling $813.28\"\n- Recorded unit price: $239.95\n- But invoice states: \"unit price of $203.32\"\n\nHere we have multiple inconsistencies between what's recorded and what's in the invoice field.\n\n## Continuing with other transactions\nI don't see any other clear inconsistencies between recorded values and invoice descriptions in the remaining transactions. The invoice field generally matches the recorded data.\n\nBased on this analysis, the Sale20240105009 transaction contains errors in its record type, amount, and unit price values.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Financial Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '203.32', 'Recorded price': '239.95', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '813.28', 'Recorded amount': '977.85', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240105009'} }\n```",
