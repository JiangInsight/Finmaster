Looking at their invoices, the Fixed Assets entry shows $8,000,000.00 which matches the recorded amount.\n\n## Interest20240105005\nThis entry shows a discrepancy:\n- The recorded date is \"2024-02-02\"\n- The invoice states \"On January 05, 2024\"\n- The recorded amount is $376.70\n- The invoice states \"$314.62\"\n\n## Interest20240114014\nFor this entry, the invoice text mentions January 14, 2024 with a total of $203.44, but no inconsistencies appear in the recorded information.\n\n## Purchase20231231001\nLooking at this entry, there's a discrepancy between the recorded cost per unit ($5,000.0) and unit price ($5,000.0) versus what's in the description (158 units at $5,000 totaling $790,000, which is correct).\n\n## Looking through other entries\nI don't see any other clear inconsistencies where the recorded fields contradict the invoice descriptions.\n\nBased on my analysis, the most significant inconsistency is in the Interest20240105005 entry, where both the date and amount are incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-05', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-02', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '314.62', 'Recorded amount': '376.7', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Interest20240105005'} }\n```",
