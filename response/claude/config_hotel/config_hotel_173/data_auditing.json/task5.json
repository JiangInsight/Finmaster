Recorded values:\n   - recorded_quantity: 2.0\n   - recorded_unit_price: 3528.04\n   - recorded_amount: 7056.08\n   - recorded_tax_amount: 529.21\n   - recorded_after_tax_amount: 10054.91\n   - recorded_cost_amount: 6000.0\n   - recorded_profit: 4584.12\n\n2. Invoice details:\n   - \"On January 17, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of **3.0** units at a unit price of $3528.04, totaling $**10584.12**. The cost amount for this transaction was $6000.00, with a tax amount of $529.21, leading to a total amount due of $10054.91. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\n3. Inconsistencies:\n   - Quantity: The invoice says 3.0 units, but the recorded value is 2.0 units\n   - Total amount: With 3 units at $3528.04 each, the amount should be $10,584.12, not $7056.08\n   - Profit: The profit calculation also appears incorrect. With cost of $6000 and revenue of $10,584.12, profit should be $4,584.12, which matches the recorded profit but not the reduced amount\n\n## Analysis of Initial20231231001\n\nI noticed another potential issue with Initial20231231001, which has three entries with the same ID but different amounts and types. The invoices show:\n- $3,000,000 for Cash deposit\n- $5,000,000 for Bank deposit\n- $8,000,000 for Fixed Assets\n\nThis suggests the Fixed Assets amount might be in error, as it's the same as the sum of the other two entries. However, since this is an initial entry, it might be intended to represent total assets across three categories, not necessarily indicating an error.\n\nAfter checking all other transactions, Sale20240117048 appears to be the only entry with clear inconsistencies between its recorded values and the invoice description.\n\nThe solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original quantity\": \"3.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"2.0\", \"Original amount\": \"10584.12\", \"Recorded amount\": \"7056.08\", \"id\": \"Sale20240117048\"}}\n```",
