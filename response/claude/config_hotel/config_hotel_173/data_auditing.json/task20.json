The Fixed Assets amount in the third entry is $8,000,000 which matches with the invoice description.\n\n## Looking for discrepancies\nLet me check each transaction against its invoice description to find inconsistencies:\n\n### Sale20240202096\nI notice a discrepancy here:\n- Recorded_type: \"Administrative Expenses\"\n- But invoice description indicates it's a \"Sale\"\n- The unit price calculation also doesn't match: $33,243.20 รท 5 = $6,648.64, but recorded_unit_price is $6,694.41\n- The invoice clearly describes a sales transaction with items sold and costs\n\n### Sale20240105008 \nLooking at other potential inconsistencies:\n- Initial20231231001 fixed assets amount is consistent\n- Each purchase transaction's amount matches quantity ร unit price\n- Most sale transactions also have consistent pricing\n\nLet me analyze all transaction entries to ensure I've caught all inconsistencies.\n\nBased on my thorough analysis, I've found the following inconsistencies:\n\n1.
