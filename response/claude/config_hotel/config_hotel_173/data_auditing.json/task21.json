Transaction ID: Initial20231231001\n   - Three separate entries with the same ID, but with different recorded types and amounts\n   - The third entry shows recorded_amount = 8000000.0, but the invoice states \"totaling $8000000.00\" which doesn't match the pattern of the first two entries (3M + 5M)\n\n2. Transaction ID: Expense20240128001\n   - The recorded category is \"Depreciation\" \n   - The recorded amount is $813.14\n   - However, the invoice states: \"On January 28, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Administrative Expenses, totaling $715.18.\"\n   - This shows a discrepancy in both the category (Depreciation vs Administrative Expenses) and the amount ($813.14 vs $715.18)\n\nLooking more closely at the second discrepancy (Expense20240128001):\n- The invoice clearly states it was an \"Administrative Expenses\" transaction\n- The invoice amount is specified as $715.18\n- The recorded category is incorrectly listed as \"Depreciation\"\n- The recorded amount is incorrectly listed as $813.14\n- Other fields match the invoice description\n\nThis is a clear inconsistency where the recorded category and amount don't match the invoice, which is generally considered more reliable.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Recorded category\": \"Depreciation\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"715.18\", \"Recorded amount\": \"813.14\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Expense20240128001\"} }\n```",
