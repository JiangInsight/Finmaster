Owner's equity represents the initial capital and the accumulated profits/losses over time.\n\n## Step 1: Identify Initial Capital\nLooking at the initial transactions on 2023-12-31:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.00\n\nTotal initial capital = 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 8,000,000.00 = 16,000,000.00\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Net Income/Loss for the Period\nTo find the end value of owner's equity, I need to determine the net income or loss, which impacts the equity.\n\n### Step 2a: Identify Revenues (Sales)\nThe revenue comes from all \"Sale\" transactions. I'll add up all sales amounts.\n\n### Step 2b: Identify Expenses\nExpenses include:\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Sales Expenses\n- Financial Expenses\n- Depreciation\n- Cost of goods sold (captured in the \"cost_amount\" field of sales transactions)\n\n### Step 2c: Calculate Net Income\nNet Income = Total Revenue - Total Expenses\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Ending Owner's Equity\nEnding Owner's Equity = Initial Owner's Equity + Net Income\n\nLooking at the transaction data, we have two depreciation entries:\n- 45,741.99 (2024-01-01) \n- 50,737.35 (2024-02-01)\n\nWe have multiple expense categories (Administrative, Sales, Financial) and sales transactions throughout January and early February 2024.\n\nThe profit from sales transactions is captured in the \"profit\" field, which represents revenue minus cost of goods sold.\n\nAfter summing all the transactions:\n- Total sales profit: 268,989.85\n- Total expenses (Administrative, Sales, Financial): 27,780.30\n- Total depreciation: 96,479.34\n\nNet Income = 268,989.85 - 27,780.30 - 96,479.34 = 144,730.21\n\nTherefore:\nEnding Owner's Equity = 16,000,000.00 + 144,730.21 = 16,144,730.21\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Owners Equity Initial Value': '16000000.00', 'Total Owners Equity End Value': '16144730.21'} }\n```",
