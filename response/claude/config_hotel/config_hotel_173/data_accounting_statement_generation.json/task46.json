From the data provided, I need to identify the initial cash deposits and bank deposits at the beginning of the period (December 31, 2023).\n\nLooking at the transactions, I can see the initial deposit entries:\n\n1. Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 3000000.0 | 3000000.0\n2. Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0\n3. Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 8000000.0 | 8000000.0\n\nFor the beginning cash and cash equivalents balance, I need to sum the cash deposit and bank deposit:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Total beginning balance: 8,000,000.00\n\nNote that fixed assets are not considered part of cash and cash equivalents, so the 8,000,000.00 in fixed assets is not included in the beginning cash balance calculation.\n\nTherefore, the beginning cash and cash equivalents balance is 8,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
