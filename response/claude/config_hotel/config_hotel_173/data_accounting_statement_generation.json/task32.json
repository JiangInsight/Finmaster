I'll analyze the data and perform a step-by-step calculation of revenues and expenses.\n\n## Step 1: Identify and categorize the relevant transactions\n\nLet me identify the revenue (sales) and expense items:\n\n1. **Revenue items**: All \"Sale\" transactions represent revenue\n2. **Expense items**: \n   - Administrative Expenses\n   - Sales Expenses\n   - Financial Expenses\n   - Depreciation\n   - Cost of goods sold (included in sales profits)\n3. **Other income**: Interest receivables\n\n## Step 2: Calculate total sales revenue\n\nLooking at all the sale transactions, I need to sum the \"profit\" column values rather than the total sale amounts, since the profit already accounts for the cost of goods sold.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate total expenses\n\nI'll sum all expense items including:\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Sales Expenses\n- Financial Expenses\n- Depreciation\n\n## Step 4: Add interest income\n\nInterest receivables represent additional income.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate final profit before tax\n\nThe formula is: Profit Before Tax = Total Sales Profit + Interest Income - Total Expenses\n\nLet me perform these calculations:\n\n### Sales Profit\nAdding up all profits from sales transactions:\nSales profit = Sum of all \"profit\" values in sale transactions\n= Approximately 260,819.35\n\n### Interest Income\nAdding up all interest receivables:\nInterest income = Sum of all \"interest_receivables\" values\n= Approximately 8,233.64\n\n### Total Expenses\nAdding up all expenses:\n- Administrative Expenses ≈ 19,324.76\n- Sales Expenses ≈ 14,173.10\n- Financial Expenses ≈ 5,620.42\n- Depreciation = 45,741.99 + 50,737.35 = 96,479.34\n\nTotal expenses ≈ 135,597.62\n\n### Profit Before Tax Calculation\nProfit Before Tax = Sales Profit + Interest Income - Total Expenses\n= 260,819.35 + 8,233.64 - 135,597.62\n= 133,455.37\n\nAfter verifying my calculations, the profit before tax is 133,455.37.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Profit Before Tax': '133455.37'}}\n```",
