Let me analyze the data step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Calculate Net Profit\nFirst, I'll identify revenue (sales) and expenses to calculate net profit.\n\n### Revenue (Sales)\nTotal sales can be calculated by summing up all the \"Sale\" type transactions.\nLooking at all the sale transactions from January 1, 2024 to February 4, 2024.\n\n### Expenses\nAdding up all expenses including:\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Sales Expenses\n- Financial Expenses\n- Depreciation expenses\n\n## Step 2: Calculate changes in working capital\n- Accounts Receivable: Unpaid sales (Account Receivable method)\n- Interest Receivable: Interest Receivables transactions\n- Inventory: Sum of purchases, which represent inventory increases\n- Accounts Payable: Unpaid purchases (Account Payable method)\n- Tax Payable: Tax amounts from sales\n\n## Step 3: Calculate investing activities\n- Fixed Assets Purchase transactions\n\n## Step 4: Calculate cash flows\nI'll analyze the beginning and ending balances of cash and bank deposits:\n- Beginning Balance: Initial cash and bank deposits (8,000,000)\n- Cash flow from operations: Revenue - Expenses + Changes in working capital\n- Cash flow from investing: Purchases of fixed assets\n- Ending Balance: Can be calculated based on the transactions\n\n## Cash Flow Statement Calculation\n\nLet me organize the transactions and calculate:\n\n1. Net Profit:\n   - Total Revenue from sales minus expenses\n   - Net Profit = -249,348.76 (sales minus expenses)\n\n2. Depreciation: \n   - 45,741.99 + 50,737.35 = 96,479.34\n\n3. Working Capital Changes:\n   - Accounts Receivable: -248,631.56 (increase, so negative impact on cash)\n   - Interest Receivable: -5,694.50 (increase, so negative impact on cash)\n   - Inventory: -7,771,030.00 (increase in inventory from purchases)\n   - Accounts Payable: 2,788,110.00 (increase, so positive impact on cash)\n   - Tax Payable: 32,166.62 (increase in tax payables)\n\n4. Investing Activities:\n   - Fixed Asset Purchase: 251,793.02\n\n5. Cash Balances:\n   - Beginning: 8,000,000.00 (3,000,000 cash + 5,000,000 bank)\n   - Net Cash Flow: -5,348,348.86\n   - Ending: 2,651,651.14\n\nBased on my calculations:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow From Operating Activities': '0.00', 'Net Profit': '-249348.76', 'Depreciation': '96479.34', '(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-248631.56', '(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-5694.50', '(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-7771030.00', 'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '2788110.00', 'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '32166.62', 'Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities': '-5096555.84', 'Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '0.00', 'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '251793.02', 'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-251793.02', 'Cash and Cash Equivalents': '0.00', 'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00', 'Ending Balance': '2651651.14', 'Net Increase': '-5348348.86'} }\n```",
