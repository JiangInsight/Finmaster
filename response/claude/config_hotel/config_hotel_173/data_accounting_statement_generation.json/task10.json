Identify the initial balance of fixed assets\n2. Track any additions to fixed assets during the period\n3. Account for depreciation\n4. Calculate the final balance\n\nLet's solve this step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the initial balance of fixed assets\n\nFrom the transaction data:\n```\nInitial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 8000000.0 | 8000000.0\n```\n\nSo the initial value of fixed assets on December 31, 2023 is 8,000,000.00.\n\n### Step 2: Identify any additions to fixed assets during the period\n\nLooking for fixed asset purchases:\n```\nFixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 251793.02 | 251793.02 |  |  | Paid | Bank Transfer |  | S009 | Supplier 9 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Kitchen Equipment4 | Kitchen Equipment\n```\n\nThis shows an additional fixed asset purchase of 251,793.02 on December 31, 2023.\n\n### Step 3: Account for depreciation\n\nThere are two depreciation entries:\n```\nDepreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45741.98999999999 | 45741.98999999999\nDepreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | 2024-02-01 | 2024-02-01 | 50737.35 | 50737.35\n```\n\nTotal depreciation = 45,741.99 + 50,737.35 = 96,479.34\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the final balance of fixed assets\n\nInitial value + Additions - Depreciation = Final value\n8,000,000.00 + 251,793.02 - 96,479.34 = 8,155,313.68\n\nHowever, I should verify if this fixed asset purchase is already part of the initial balance or if it's a separate addition.\n\nSince the fixed asset purchase is dated 2023-12-31 (the same date as the initial balance), I need to carefully determine if it's already included in the initial balance.\n\nBased on the transaction date being the same as the initial balance date, and considering that this is a separate transaction entry, I'll treat this as an additional purchase that should be added to the initial balance.\n\nThis gives us:\n\nInitial non-current assets: 8,000,000.00\nFinal non-current assets: 8,000,000.00 + 251,793.02 - 96,479.34 = 8,155,313.68\n\nTherefore:\n- Total Non-current Assets Initial Value: 8,000,000.00\n- Total Non-current Assets End Value: 8,155,313.68\n\nLet me format this as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '8155313.68'} }\n```",
