In this dataset, I need to identify all the transactions that qualify as investing activities.\n\nLet me examine the data for:\n1. Purchase of fixed assets\n2. Sale of fixed assets\n3. Investments or sale of investments\n\nLooking through the data, I can see fixed asset transactions labeled as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" in the type column.\n\nI found one specific transaction:\n\n| id | type | date | recorded_date | amount | recorded_amount | payment_method | supplier_id | supplier_name | asset_name | asset_type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 251793.02 | 251793.02 | Bank Transfer | S009 | Supplier 9 | Kitchen Equipment4 | Kitchen Equipment |\n\nThis transaction represents a purchase of fixed assets (Kitchen Equipment) for 251,793.02.\n\nI don't see any other transactions in the dataset that would qualify as investing activities. There are no sales of fixed assets or investment transactions.\n\nTherefore, the net cash flow from investing activities would be the negative of the fixed asset purchase amount, as outflows are represented as negative values in cash flow statements.\n\nNet Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -251,793.02\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-251793.02'} }\n```\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculation. I need to make sure I've captured all relevant transactions.\n\nAfter careful review, I can confirm that there is only one transaction related to investing activities in this dataset, which is the fixed asset purchase of 251,793.02.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-251793.02'} }",
