Let's start by categorizing and calculating each component.\n\n## Step 1: Calculate Main Business Revenue\nFirst, I need to identify all sales transactions and sum them up. These are records with \"type\" containing \"Sale\".\n\nLooking through the data, I find all entries starting with \"Sale\" (from Sale20240102001 through Sale20240204104). Summing up the \"amount\" column for all these sales:\n\nTotal Sales Revenue: 835,246.72\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\nFor COGS, I need to add up the \"cost_amount\" column from all sale transactions.\n\nFrom analyzing all the sales entries, the total cost of goods sold is: 626,670.00\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Gross Profit\nGross Profit = Main Business Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold\nGross Profit = 835,246.72 - 626,670.00 = 208,576.72\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Operating Expenses\n\n### Administrative Expenses\nI need to sum all entries with \"type\" as \"Administrative Expenses\":\nTotal Administrative Expenses: 15,778.70\n\n### Selling Expenses\nSum of all entries with \"type\" as \"Sales Expenses\":\nTotal Selling Expenses: 11,297.13\n\n### Depreciation\nSum of all entries with \"type\" as \"Depreciation\":\nDepreciation20240101001: 45,741.99\nDepreciation20240201002: 50,737.35\nTotal Depreciation: 96,479.34\n\n### Financial Expenses\nSum of all entries with \"type\" as \"Financial Expenses\":\nTotal Financial Expenses: 4,531.42\n\n### Total Expenses\nTotal Expenses = Administrative Expenses + Selling Expenses + Depreciation + Financial Expenses\nTotal Expenses = 15,778.70 + 11,297.13 + 96,479.34 + 4,531.42 = 128,086.59\n\n## Step 5: Calculate Other Income\n\n### Interest Income\nSum of all entries with \"type\" as \"Interest Receivables\":\nTotal Interest Income: 7,088.84\n\n## Step 6: Calculate Profit Before Tax\nProfit Before Tax = Gross Profit - Total Expenses + Interest Income\nProfit Before Tax = 208,576.72 - 128,086.59 + 7,088.84 = 87,578.97\n\n## Step 7: Calculate Tax Expense\nBased on the sales transactions, I need to sum the \"tax_amount\" column for all sales:\nTotal Tax Expense: 41,762.34\n\n## Step 8: Calculate Net Profit\nNet Profit = Profit Before Tax - Tax Expense\nNet Profit = 87,578.97 - 41,762.34 = 45,816.63\n\n## Summary\nNow that I have calculated all components, let me prepare the final income statement:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Main Business Revenue': '835246.72', 'Total Revenue': '835246.72', 'Cost of Goods Sold': '626670.00', 'Total Cost': '626670.00', 'Gross Profit': '208576.72', 'Administrative Expenses': '15778.70', 'Selling Expenses': '11297.13', 'Depreciation': '96479.34', 'Financial Expenses': '4531.42', 'Total Expenses': '128086.59', 'Interest Income': '7088.84', 'Profit Before Tax': '87578.97', 'Tax Expense': '41762.34', 'Net Profit': '45816.63'} }\n```",
