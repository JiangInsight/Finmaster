These are typically marked as initial contributions at the beginning of the period.\n\nFrom the transaction data, I can see the following initial transactions from December 31, 2023:\n- Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 3,000,000.0\n- Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 5,000,000.0\n- Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 8,000,000.0\n\nThese initial transactions represent the owners' contributions to the business and form the paid-in capital.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the initial value of paid-in capital\nThe initial paid-in capital is the sum of these initial contributions:\n- Cash: 3,000,000.0\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n- Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.0\n\nTotal initial paid-in capital = 3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 + 8,000,000.0 = 16,000,000.0\n\n## Step 3: Determine if there were any additional capital contributions or withdrawals\nAfter examining the entire dataset, I don't see any additional transactions specifically labeled as capital contributions or withdrawals. There are no equity issuances, redemptions, or other owner transactions that would affect the paid-in capital.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final value of paid-in capital\nSince there were no additional capital contributions or withdrawals during the period, the final paid-in capital remains the same as the initial value:\n\nFinal paid-in capital = 16,000,000.0\n\n## Step 5: Format the answer\nThe initial paid-in capital is 16,000,000.00 and the final paid-in capital is also 16,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '16000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '16000000.00'}}\n```",
