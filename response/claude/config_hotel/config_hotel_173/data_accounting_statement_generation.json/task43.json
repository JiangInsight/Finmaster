Let me approach this systematically.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the operating activities\nOperating activities are the core business activities that generate revenue and include:\n- Cash receipts from sales of goods/services\n- Cash payments to suppliers for goods/services\n- Cash payments to employees\n- Other operating cash receipts and payments\n\n## Step 2: Classify all transactions\nI'll classify all transactions into operating, investing, and financing activities, focusing on cash transactions (where cash or bank transfer is involved and payment status is \"Paid\").\n\n## Step 3: Calculate operating cash inflows\nLet's identify all cash inflows from operating activities:\n\n### Operating Cash Inflows (Sales with Cash payment method):\n- 2024-01-02: 42,371.15 (Sale20240102001)\n- 2024-01-03: 5,047.73 + 4,128.39 = 9,176.12\n- 2024-01-05: 813.28 + 13,672.71 = 14,485.99\n- 2024-01-06: 10,076.58\n- 2024-01-07: 24,104.80\n- 2024-01-08: 467.92\n- 2024-01-09: 44,953.65\n- 2024-01-10: 4,543.16\n- 2024-01-11: 1,018.24\n- 2024-01-12: 4,388.40 + 1,523.79 + 3,149.66 = 9,061.85\n- 2024-01-13: 498.08 + 43,932.85 = 44,430.93\n- 2024-01-14: 6,556.16\n- 2024-01-15: 17,389.12\n- 2024-01-16: 600.39 + 18,135.92 = 18,736.31\n- 2024-01-17: 20,877.90\n- 2024-01-18: 1,587.42\n- 2024-01-19: 1,040.92\n- 2024-01-20: 10,053.05 + 15,709.85 = 25,762.90\n- 2024-01-21: 995.15 + 42,114.20 = 43,109.35\n- 2024-01-22: 3,304.22\n- 2024-01-23: 5,897.04\n- 2024-01-24: 17,945.44 + 7,180.40 = 25,125.84\n- 2024-01-25: 587.01 + 10,729.76 = 11,316.77\n- 2024-01-26: 6,270.35\n- 2024-01-27: 16,028.32 + 8,186.08 = 24,214.40\n- 2024-01-28: 20,553.21\n- 2024-01-29: 9,546.66 + 1,240.86 = 10,787.52\n- 2024-01-30: 2,835.75\n- 2024-01-31: 5,449.08\n- 2024-02-01: 13,490.28 + 9,746.16 + 2,121.75 = 25,358.19\n- 2024-02-02: 12,756.50 + 11,491.95 = 24,248.45\n- 2024-02-03: 6,405.87\n- 2024-02-04: 4,195.58\n\nTotal Operating Cash Inflows: 526,317.50\n\n## Step 4: Calculate operating cash outflows\n\n### Operating Cash Outflows:\n\n1) Administrative Expenses:\n- 2024-01-01: 615.36\n- 2024-01-05: 477.24 + 301.69 = 778.93\n- 2024-01-07: 895.72\n- 2024-01-08: 939.72 + 770.84 = 1,710.56\n- 2024-01-09: 733.73\n- 2024-01-10: 276.95 + 766.66 = 1,043.61\n- 2024-01-13: 856.94 + 304.95 = 1,161.89\n- 2024-01-15: 651.86\n- 2024-01-16: 661.76\n- 2024-01-17: 611.42\n- 2024-01-19: 742.42\n- 2024-01-20: 821.12\n- 2024-01-21: 925.82\n- 2024-01-23: 358.91\n- 2024-01-25: 484.40\n- 2024-01-26: 455.40\n- 2024-01-28: 715.18\n- 2024-01-31: 418.63\n- 2024-02-01: 739.88 + 269.03 = 1,008.91\n- 2024-02-03: 885.97\n- 2024-02-04: 884.93\n\nTotal Administrative Expenses: 17,246.51\n\n2) Sales Expenses:\n- 2024-01-02: 818.23\n- 2024-01-03: 476.79\n- 2024-01-04: 744.35\n- 2024-01-06: 733.63\n- 2024-01-11: 351.34\n- 2024-01-12: 909.56\n- 2024-01-15: 944.59\n- 2024-01-18: 962.21\n- 2024-01-19: 784.06\n- 2024-01-22: 202.16\n- 2024-01-24: 720.70\n- 2024-01-26: 444.79\n- 2024-01-27: 898.56\n- 2024-01-29: 831.34\n- 2024-01-30: 788.26 + 753.93 = 1,542.19\n- 2024-02-03: 109.32\n\nTotal Sales Expenses: 11,473.82\n\n3) Financial Expenses:\n- 2024-01-06: 341.86\n- 2024-01-07: 160.75\n- 2024-01-20: 752.32\n- 2024-01-25: 845.07\n- 2024-01-27: 112.95\n- 2024-01-28: 603.61\n- 2024-01-29: 990.77\n- 2024-02-02: 724.84\n\nTotal Financial Expenses: 4,532.17\n\n4) Purchases (Inventory/Supplies) - paid in cash:\n- 2023-12-31: 790,000.00 + 374,400.00 + 1,340,000.00 + 146,080.00 + 444,000.00 + 154,500.00 + 34,350.00 + 21,000.00 + 95,920.00 + 409,500.00 + 432,000.00 + 360,000.00 + 81,200.00 = 4,682,950.00\n\nTotal Cash Paid for Purchases: 4,682,950.00\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = Total Cash Inflows - Total Cash Outflows\n= 526,317.50 - (17,246.51 + 11,473.82 + 4,532.17 + 4,682,950.00)\n= 526,317.50 - 4,716,202.50\n= -4,189,885.00\n\nHowever, I need to double-check as this seems off. Let me reconsider the initial balances and transfers.\n\nLooking more carefully at the data, I notice that:\n- Fixed asset purchases are not operating activities (should exclude 251,793.02)\n- Initial deposits are not operating activities (should exclude initial deposits)\n- Depreciation is a non-cash expense (should add back 45,741.99 + 50,737.35 = 96,479.34)\n\nActually, since we're calculating the net cash flow directly from transactions rather than adjusting net income, we would simply exclude the depreciation entries as they don't involve cash.\n\nAfter making these adjustments, my final calculation is:\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 526,317.50 - 4,716,202.50 = -4,189,885.00\n\nThis represents a significant cash outflow from operations, which makes sense given the large inventory purchases made at the end of December and the relatively lower sales in January.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities': '-4189885.00'} }\n```",
