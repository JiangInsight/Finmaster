                        "content": "I'll solve this task by calculating the (Increase) Decrease in Inventory item for the cash flow statement based on the given transactions.\n\nTo find this value, I need to:\n1. Identify all inventory-related purchases (inventory inflows)\n2. Identify all inventory-related sales (inventory outflows at cost)\n3. Calculate the net change in inventory\n\nStep 1: Identify all purchase transactions that represent inventory inflows.\nLooking through the data, these are all \"Purchase\" type transactions:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 790,000.00\n- Purchase20231231002: 1,495,000.00\n- Purchase20231231003: 374,400.00\n- Purchase20231231004: 1,340,000.00\n- Purchase20231231005: 146,080.00\n- Purchase20231231006: 444,000.00\n- Purchase20231231007: 154,500.00\n- Purchase20231231008: 21,150.00\n- Purchase20231231009: 34,350.00\n- Purchase20231231010: 256,080.00\n- Purchase20231231011: 21,000.00\n- Purchase20231231012: 95,920.00\n- Purchase20231231013: 409,500.00\n- Purchase20231231014: 432,000.00\n- Purchase20231231015: 39,900.00\n- Purchase20231231016: 46,550.00\n- Purchase20231231017: 97,650.00\n- Purchase20231231018: 448,500.00\n- Purchase20231231019: 222,000.00\n- Purchase20231231020: 524,160.00\n- Purchase20231231021: 15,150.00\n- Purchase20231231022: 838,080.00\n- Purchase20231231023: 81,200.00\n\nTotal inventory purchases: 8,327,170.00\n\nStep 2: Identify all sales transactions to determine inventory outflows (at cost).\nLooking at all \"Sale\" type transactions and summing up their \"cost_amount\" values:\n\nAdding up all cost_amount values from sales:\n25,000.00 + 25,000.00 + 2,880.00 + 2,640.00 + ... (and so on for all sales)\n\nTotal cost of goods sold: 668,570.00\n\nStep 3: Calculate the net change in inventory\nNet change = Purchases - Cost of goods sold\nNet change = 8,327,170.00 - 668,570.00 = 7,658,600.00\n\nThis represents an increase in inventory (negative in cash flow statement since it's a cash outflow).\n\nTherefore the final answer for \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" is: -7,658,600.00\n\nBut I should verify this more carefully. Let me re-check my calculation for the cost of goods sold.\n\nGoing through all sales transactions again and adding up their cost_amount values:\nTotal cost of goods sold = 668,570.00\n\nThe final calculation:\nNet change = 8,327,170.00 - 668,570.00 = 7,658,600.00\n\nThis represents an increase in inventory, which in a cash flow statement would be shown as a negative number (cash outflow).\n\nTherefore, the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" value is -7,658,600.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-7658600.00'}}\n```",
