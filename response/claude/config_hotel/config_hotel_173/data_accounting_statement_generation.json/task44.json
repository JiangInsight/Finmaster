These are typically labeled with type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\".\n\nFrom the data, I can see the following fixed asset purchase transaction:\n- FixedAsset20231231001 with amount 251793.02 for \"Kitchen Equipment4\"\n\n## Step 2: Verify if there are any other fixed asset related transactions\nThe initial balance shows:\n- Initial20231231001 with type \"Fixed Assets\" and amount 8000000.0\n\nHowever, this appears to be an initial balance entry rather than a purchase during the period, so it shouldn't be included in the calculation of fixed asset purchases.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total purchase of fixed assets\nThe total purchase of fixed assets is the sum of all fixed asset purchase transactions:\n- 251793.02 (FixedAsset20231231001)\n\nTherefore, the total purchase of fixed assets is 251793.02.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '251793.02'} }\n```",
