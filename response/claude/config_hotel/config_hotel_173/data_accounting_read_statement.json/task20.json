This represents the direct costs attributable to the production of goods that were sold during the reporting period.\n\nLooking at the income statement provided in the problem:\n\n1. I can see the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with a value of 543370.00 on 2024-02-04.\n2. This is the value I need to extract as it represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '543370.00'}}\n```",
