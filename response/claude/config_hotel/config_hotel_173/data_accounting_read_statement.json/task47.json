In the statement, I can see that the net increase is calculated as the difference between:\n1. Beginning Balance: 8000000.00\n2. Ending Balance: 3237369.90\n\nThe calculation is: Ending Balance - Beginning Balance = 3237369.90 - 8000000.00 = -4762630.10\n\nTherefore, the net addition in cash and cash equivalents is -4762630.10, and its two component sub-items are:\n- Beginning Balance: 8000000.00\n- Ending Balance: 3237369.90\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-4762630.10', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_item value2': '3237369.90'}}}\n```",
