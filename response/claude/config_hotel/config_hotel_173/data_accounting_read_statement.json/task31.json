I can see that \"Profit Before Tax\" is directly listed as 186506.07\n\n2. The calculation for Profit Before Tax generally involves:\n   - Revenue\n   - Costs\n   - Expenses\n   - Other income items\n\n3. From the statement, I can identify the following sub-items that would contribute to this:\n   - Total Revenue: 851679.79\n   - Total Cost: 543370.00\n   - Total Expenses: 129579.16\n   - Interest Income: 7775.44\n\n4. The formula would be: Total Revenue - Total Cost - Total Expenses + Interest Income = Profit Before Tax\n   851679.79 - 543370.00 - 129579.16 + 7775.44 = 186506.07\n\nSo the profit before tax is 186506.07, with the sub-items being Total Revenue (851679.79), Total Cost (543370.00), Total Expenses (129579.16), and Interest Income (7775.44).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '186506.07', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '851679.79', 'sub_item value2': '543370.00', 'sub_item value3': '129579.16', 'sub_item value4': '7775.44'}}}\n```",
