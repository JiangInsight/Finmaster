However, the task asks for the \"reduction in the amount of assets held for sale\" which corresponds to this line item.\n\nThe value shown is \"-7783800.00\", which represents the change in inventory during the period. This is the amount we need to extract as per the task description.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-7783800.00'}}\n```",
