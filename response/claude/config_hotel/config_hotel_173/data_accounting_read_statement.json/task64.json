Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense (from Income Statement)\n2. Addition in amount owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit (from Balance Sheet)\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares (from Balance Sheet)\n\nLet me analyze each statement:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- \"Accounts Payable\" shows the amount owed for goods/services on credit: 3,333,720.00\n- \"Paid-in Capital\" represents capital contributed by shareholders: 16,000,000.00\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- \"Profit Before Tax\" shows the profit before deducting tax expense: 186,506.07\n\nTherefore:\n- value1 = \"16000000.00\" (Paid-in Capital)\n- value2 = \"186506.07\" (Profit Before Tax)\n- value3 = \"3333720.00\" (Accounts Payable)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16000000.00', 'value2': '186506.07', 'value3': '3333720.00'} }\n```",
