Taxes accrued but not yet paid (Balance Sheet)\n3. Total income from ordinary activities (Income Statement)\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement to extract these values:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- \"Taxes Payable\" represents taxes accrued but not yet paid: 42584.04\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- \"Total Revenue\" represents total income from ordinary activities: 851679.79\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" represents net cash generated from principal revenue-producing activities: -4510837.08\n\nTherefore, the three values I need to extract are:\n1. value1 (Taxes Payable): 42584.04\n2. value2 (Total Revenue): 851679.79\n3. value3 (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities): -4510837.08\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '42584.04', 'value2': '851679.79', 'value3': '-4510837.08'}}\n```",
