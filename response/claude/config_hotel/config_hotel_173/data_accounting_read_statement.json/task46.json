This is calculated from the Purchase of Fixed Assets, which is the only sub-item in this section.\n\nThe purchase of fixed assets is shown as a positive number (251793.02) in the statement, but it contributes negatively to the cash flow (since purchasing assets uses cash), resulting in the negative net cash flow from investing activities (-251793.02).\n\nSo, the value for the net cash flow from investing activities is -251793.02, and the sub-item value (Purchase of Fixed Assets) is 251793.02.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-251793.02', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '251793.02'}} }\n```",
