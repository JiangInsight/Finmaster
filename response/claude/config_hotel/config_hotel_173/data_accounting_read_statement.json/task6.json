Fixed Assets are typically buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, and other physical assets used in operations.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Fixed Assets value: 8000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- End Fixed Assets value: 8251793.02 (as of 2024-02-04)\n\nThe Accumulated Depreciation is a contra-asset account that reduces the value of Fixed Assets, but the question specifically asks for the values of the tangible items themselves, which is represented by the Fixed Assets line.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '8251793.02'}}\n```",
