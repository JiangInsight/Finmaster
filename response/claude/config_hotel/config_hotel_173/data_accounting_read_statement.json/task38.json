A decrease in accounts receivable would be a positive number (cash inflow), while an increase would be a negative number (cash outflow).\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement provided, I can see:\n- \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable: -335967.05\"\n\nThe negative value indicates this is an increase in accounts receivable, not a decrease. However, the task is asking for the value of the decrease, which is the same figure but represents the increase in amounts owed to the entity.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item is \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with a value of \"-335967.05\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-335967.05'}}\n```",
