Reduction in inventory\n3. Net cash flow from investing activities\n4. Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n\nLet me analyze the statement:\n\n1. \"Depreciation\" is 96479.34, which represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of assets.\n\n2. \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" is -7783800.00, which represents the reduction (or in this case, an increase shown as a negative) in inventory.\n\n3. \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is -251793.02, representing the net amount from acquisition and disposal of long-term assets.\n\n4. \"Net Increase\" in Cash and Cash Equivalents is -4762630.10, representing the net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\nThese values need to be maintained in the original order from the statement.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '96479.34', 'value2': '-7783800.00', 'value3': '-251793.02', 'value4': '-4762630.10'}}\n```",
