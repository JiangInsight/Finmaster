These would typically be classified as inventory.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet provided, I can see that \"Inventory\" is listed as a line item under current assets. This represents goods that are held for sale, in production, or being manufactured.\n\nThe values for inventory in the balance sheet are:\n- Initial value: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- End value: 7783800.00 (as of 2024-02-04)\n\nSo the assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business (inventory) had an initial value of 0.00 and an end value of 7783800.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '7783800.00'}}\n```",
