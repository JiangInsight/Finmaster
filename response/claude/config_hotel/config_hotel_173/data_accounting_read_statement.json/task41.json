In the Operating Activities section, I can see the line \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with a value of 42584.04.\n\nThis line item represents the increase in the amounts of tax that have been accrued but not yet paid, as tax payable represents taxes that have been recognized in the accounting records but have not yet been paid to the tax authorities.\n\nSince the value is positive (42584.04), it indicates an increase in tax payable, which means more tax was accrued than was paid during this period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '42584.04'}}\n```",
