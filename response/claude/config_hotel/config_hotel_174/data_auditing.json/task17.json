Transaction ID: Sale20240114041\n   - Recorded type shows \"Purchase\" but the invoice clearly describes it as a \"Sale\"\n   - Recorded receive_method shows \"Cash\" but in the text it states \"account receviable\"\n\n2. Transaction ID: Initial20231231001\n   - There's an inconsistency across the three rows with the same ID\n   - The third entry shows 8000000.0 in amount, while according to the invoice text it should be 5000000.0\n   - However, I need to validate this further by examining all three entries\n\nLooking at the first transaction (Sale20240114041), the invoice information states it's a Sale transaction but it's recorded as a Purchase. Additionally, the invoice mentions \"account receviable\" but it's recorded as \"Cash\" in the receive_method.\n\nFor the Initial20231231001 transaction, I need to check all three entries with this ID to verify if there's truly an inconsistency.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Purchase', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Cash', 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240114041'} }\n```",
