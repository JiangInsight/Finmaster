Looking at the invoice for the Fixed Assets entry, it says $8,000,000.00, which matches the recorded amount.\n\nNext, I'll examine each transaction and look for inconsistencies between the recorded fields and what's stated in the invoice.\n\nFor transaction `Sale20240104009`, I see a significant issue:\n- The invoice describes this as a Sale transaction, but it's recorded as \"Financial Expenses\"\n- The invoice states the amount as $37,810.30, but the recorded amount is $41,206.34\n- The invoice date is January 04, 2024, but the recorded date is February 02, 2024\n\nThis is a clear case of inconsistency where the transaction type, amount, and date don't match the invoice.\n\nLet me continue examining other transactions to find any additional discrepancies...\n\nAfter reviewing all transactions, the most significant inconsistency I found is with `Sale20240104009`, where there are three key discrepancies between what's recorded and what the invoice states.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Financial Expenses', 'Original date': '2024-01-04', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-02', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '5.0', 'Recorded quantity': '5.0', 'Original price': '7562.06', 'Recorded price': '7562.06', 'Original receive_method': 'Cash', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Cash', 'Original amount': '37810.30', 'Recorded amount': '41206.34', 'Original tax': '1890.52', 'Recorded tax': '1890.52', 'Original profit': '12810.3', 'Recorded profit': '12810.3', 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240104009'} }\n```",
