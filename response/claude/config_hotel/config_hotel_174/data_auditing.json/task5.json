I'll look for discrepancies between fields in the same transaction, focusing on cases where information in the invoice doesn't match the recorded values.\n\n## Analysis steps:\n1. For each transaction, I'll compare the recorded values with what's stated in the invoice\n2. I'll pay special attention to numerical calculations (amounts, taxes, profits)\n3. I'll prioritize the invoice information as more reliable\n\nLet me analyze the data row by row:\n\nFor record ID \"Sale20240202099\", I notice a discrepancy:\n- The invoice states: \"a Sale, consisting of 4.0 units at a unit price of $551.33, totaling $2205.32.\"\n- But the recorded_quantity shows: \"3.0\" and recorded_amount shows: \"$1653.99\"\n\nThe problem is that the recorded quantity (3) doesn't match the quantity mentioned in the invoice (4). The recorded amount ($1653.99) is also inconsistent with what would be expected for 4 units (which would be $2205.32).\n\nAdditionally, the recorded_amount of $1653.99 is consistent with 3 units at $551.33 per unit (3 Ã— $551.33 = $1653.99), but this contradicts the invoice information.\n\nThis is a clear case where the invoice (considered more reliable) indicates the original quantity should be 4.0, but the recorded quantity is incorrectly listed as 3.0.\n\nAfter reviewing the rest of the data, this is the only inconsistency I've found where invoice information contradicts recorded field values.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '4.0', 'Recorded quantity': '3.0', 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '2205.32', 'Recorded amount': '1653.99', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': '805.32', 'Recorded profit': '805.32', 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240202099'} }\n```",
