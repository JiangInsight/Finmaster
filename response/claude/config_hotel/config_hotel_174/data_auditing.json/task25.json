The recorded_type is \"Sales Expenses\" but the id starts with \"Sale\", and the invoice text describes it as a \"Sale\" transaction.\n2. The recorded_date is \"2024-01-28\" but the invoice text states \"On January 05, 2024\".\n3. The recorded_unit_price is \"501.56\" but the invoice text states \"unit price of $463.95\".\n\nThis transaction has multiple inconsistencies. The invoice field is typically considered more reliable, and it clearly indicates this should be a \"Sale\" with the date of January 05, 2024, and a unit price of $463.95.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can identify the following inconsistencies:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-05\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-28\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"463.95\", \"Recorded price\": \"501.56\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240105012\"}}\n```",
