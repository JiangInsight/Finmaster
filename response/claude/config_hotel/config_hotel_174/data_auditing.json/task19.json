The `recorded_type` is \"Purchase\", but the invoice description clearly states it's a \"Sale\" transaction\n2. The `recorded_date` is \"2024-02-01\", but the invoice description states it was issued on \"January 11, 2024\"\n\nThis is a clear mismatch between the recorded fields and the invoice information. Let me verify the details from the invoice description:\n- The invoice states it's a Sale transaction from January 11, 2024\n- It involves 2 units at $226.03 per unit, totaling $452.06\n- The cost amount was $300.00 with a tax of $22.60\n- It was paid via Cash\n\nThese details confirm that there are inconsistencies in the recorded category (type) and the recorded date for this transaction.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Purchase\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-11\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-02-01\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240111035\"}}\n```",
