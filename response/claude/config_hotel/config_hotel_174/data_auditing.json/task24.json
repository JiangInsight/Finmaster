If the recorded amount matches quantity × unit price\n2. If the after-tax amount equals recorded amount - tax amount\n3. If profit calculations are consistent with cost and sale amounts\n4. If other fields match the information in the invoice\n\nLooking through the data:\n\nFor transaction \"Sale20240120060\":\n- The invoice states: \"consisting of 4.0 units at a unit price of $561.02, totaling $2244.08\"\n- But the recorded amount is $2801.09, which doesn't match\n- The recorded unit price is $450.89, which doesn't match the invoice's $561.02\n- The correct calculation would be 4.0 × $561.02 = $2244.08\n- This indicates both a price and total amount discrepancy\n\nFor transaction \"Initial20231231001\":\n- No inconsistencies found between the recorded values and the invoice information.\n\nI also noticed \"Sale20240129055\" has inconsistencies in the example solution, but I don't see that particular issue in my current dataset.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original price\": \"561.02\", \"Recorded price\": \"450.89\", \"Original amount\": \"2244.08\", \"Recorded amount\": \"2801.09\", \"id\": \"Sale20240120060\"}}\n```",
