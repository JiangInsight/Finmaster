                        "content": "I'll analyze each transaction to identify internal inconsistencies by comparing the recorded information with what should be correct based on other fields and the invoice details.\n\nLet me examine the Sale20240121064 transaction first:\n\n**Sale20240121064:**\n- Invoice says: \"On January 21, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $2186.23, totaling $4372.46. The cost amount was $3000.00, with a tax amount of $218.62, leading to a total amount due of $4153.84. The receive_method was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- Recorded date: 2024-01-31 (Different from invoice date of January 21)\n- Recorded quantity: 1.0 (Different from invoice quantity of 2.0)\n- Recorded unit price: $1935.23 (Different from invoice price of $2186.23)\n- Recorded amount: $2186.23 (Doesn't match either the total amount in the invoice or calculation from recorded quantity and price)\n\nThe recorded amount field appears to be incorrect based on other information. Let me calculate:\n- From invoice: 2.0 units × $2186.23 = $4372.46\n- From recorded fields: 1.0 unit × $1935.23 = $1935.23\n\nThere are multiple inconsistencies in this transaction. The correct values should be:\n- Date: 2024-01-21 (from invoice)\n- Quantity: 2.0 (from invoice)\n- Unit price: $2186.23 (from invoice)\n- Amount: $4372.46 (from invoice and calculation)\n\nLooking at the column data:\n- The recorded_amount shows $2186.23\n- This doesn't match what would be calculated from recorded_quantity (1.0) × recorded_unit_price ($1935.23)\n- This also doesn't match the invoice total of $4372.46\n\nI need to check if the recorded_amount is even correctly shown in the problem data. Let me verify this...\n\nActually, I see the recorded_amount is shown as $2186.23 in one place, but the transaction details suggest the amount is different.\n\nAfter carefully checking the transaction in full detail, I can see that:\n- Recorded date is 2024-01-31 (invoice says January 21, 2024)\n- Recorded amount is $2186.23 (invoice says totaling $4372.46)\n- Recorded quantity is 1.0 (invoice says 2.0 units)\n- Recorded unit price is $1935.23 (invoice says $2186.23)\n\nThis transaction has multiple discrepancies between the recorded fields and what the invoice indicates.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-21', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-31', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '2.00', 'Recorded quantity': '1.00', 'Original price': '2186.23', 'Recorded price': '1935.23', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '4372.46', 'Recorded amount': '2186.23', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240121064'} }",
