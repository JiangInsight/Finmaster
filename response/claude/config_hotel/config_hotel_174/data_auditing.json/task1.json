Let me examine each transaction row by row.\n\nLooking through the data, I've identified two key inconsistencies:\n\n1. In transaction ID \"Expense20240119001\", the recorded_type is \"Sale\" but the invoice describes it as \"Administrative Expenses\". \n\n2. For transaction ID \"Initial20231231001\", there are three entries with the same ID but different recorded amounts. According to the invoices, there are three separate deposits: Cash deposit ($3,000,000), Bank deposit ($5,000,000), and Fixed Assets ($8,000,000). The third entry shows $8,000,000 which doesn't match any single invoice amount.\n\nLet me verify the details of these inconsistencies against the invoice text:\n\nFor \"Expense20240119001\", the invoice clearly states: \"On January 19, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Administrative Expenses, totaling $388.42.\" However, the recorded_type field shows \"Sale\" instead of \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n\nFor the \"Initial20231231001\" transactions, the invoices show three separate transactions, but the third entry's amount ($8,000,000) doesn't match its invoice amount of $8,000,000. Looking more carefully, this seems to be a summing error - the Fixed Assets entry should be independent but appears to be showing the total of all three initial deposits.\n\nBased on my analysis, I'll focus on the first inconsistency as it's a clear mismatch between record and invoice:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Expense20240119001\"}}\n```",
