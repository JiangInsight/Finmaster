However, this appears to be a summation error as this ID has multiple entries.\n\nFor transaction `Sale20240128083`, there's a clear discrepancy:\n1. The recorded_type is \"Purchase\" but the invoice description starts with \"an invoice was issued for a Sale\"\n2. The recorded_tax_amount is 16964.31, but according to the invoice, it should be 1013.47\n3. The type of transaction is misclassified\n\nLet me check other transactions as well:\n\nFor transaction `Sale20240114022`, the data in the context shows an Administrative Expenses categorization, but the ID starts with \"Sale\" which is internally inconsistent.\n\nAfter reviewing all transactions, I've found the most significant inconsistencies in the `Sale20240128083` transaction.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Purchase\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": \"1013.47\", \"Recorded tax\": \"16964.31\", \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240128083\"}}\n```",
