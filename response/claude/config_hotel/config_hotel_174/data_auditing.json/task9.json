This appears to be by design.\n\n## Looking at Sale Transactions\nFor sale transactions, I need to check if:\n1. amount = unit_price Ã— quantity\n2. after_tax_amount = amount - tax_amount\n3. profit = amount - cost_amount\n\n### Sale20240126076\nI notice a major discrepancy in the tax amount:\n- Transaction shows a total of $25937.58 for 3 units at $8645.86 each\n- The recorded tax amount is $23298.73, which is 89.8% of the total amount\n- This is unusually high for a tax rate and doesn't match other transactions\n- Checking: Normal tax would be around 5% of the amount, which is approximately $1296.88\n- The invoice text mentions \"leading to a total amount due of $24640.70\" which confirms the tax should be $1296.88 ($25937.58 - $24640.70)\n\nThis is clearly an error in the recorded tax amount.\n\n### Sale20240108014 (from the example)\n- Let me verify this known error as well:\n- The recorded tax is $246948.27 which is significantly higher than expected\n- For a sale of $251306.24, the tax should be about 5%, or around $12565.31\n- This matches the analysis in the example showing the correct tax is $12565.31\n\nI'll continue checking other transactions but these appear to be the major inconsistencies with the tax amounts.\n\nLet me check other transaction types:\n\n## Initial20231231001\n- The third entry shows $8000000.00, but the invoice says $5000000.00. However, this could be combining the previous entries.\n\nNo other obvious inconsistencies are found after reviewing the transactions.\n\nBased on my analysis, the key finding is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": \"1296.88\", \"Recorded tax\": \"23298.73\", \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240126076\"} }\n```",
