Also, the amount shows $147.5 but the invoice states \"$132.50\".\n\nLet me provide the solution for the inconsistencies I've found:\n\nFor Initial20231231001 (Fixed Assets), the recorded amount ($8000000.0) doesn't match the invoice amount ($5000000.00). However, this might not be an error as the three entries together (3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000) might be a consolidated amount presented differently in the record.\n\nFor Interest20240121021, there's a clear category mismatch and amount discrepancy:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Interest Receivables', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '132.50', 'Recorded amount': '147.5', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Interest20240121021'} }\n```",
