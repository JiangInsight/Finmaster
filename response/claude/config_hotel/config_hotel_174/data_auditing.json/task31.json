I'll compare the recorded values with what would be expected based on the calculations and information in the invoice field, which is generally more reliable.\n\nLet me start by examining each transaction:\n\nFor transaction `Sale20240202101`:\n- The invoice states: \"On February 02, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $577.39, totaling $1154.78.\"\n- However, the recorded data shows:\n  - `recorded_quantity`: 1.0 (should be 2.0)\n  - `recorded_unit_price`: $668.95 (should be $577.39)\n  - `recorded_amount`: $577.39 (should be $1154.78)\n  - `recorded_tax_amount`: $970.7 (too high - should be $57.74, which is 5% of $1154.78)\n\nThe inconsistencies are clear when comparing the invoice text with the recorded values. The most reliable data is in the invoice description.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original quantity\": \"2.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Original price\": \"577.39\", \"Recorded price\": \"668.95\", \"Original amount\": \"1154.78\", \"Recorded amount\": \"577.39\", \"Original tax\": \"57.74\", \"Recorded tax\": \"970.7\", \"Original profit\": \"454.78\", \"Recorded profit\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240202101\"}}\n```",
