The recorded_date is \"2024-02-23\", but the invoice states \"On January 31, 2024, an invoice was issued...\"\n2. The recorded_unit_price is \"961.67\", but the invoice mentions \"at a unit price of $1160.91\"\n\nThis indicates two inconsistencies:\n- The date in the recorded fields doesn't match the date in the invoice\n- The unit price in the recorded fields doesn't match the unit price in the invoice\n\nFor transaction Initial20231231001, I see:\n- There are three entries with the same ID but different amounts and types\n- Looking at recorded amounts: 3000000.0 for Cash deposit, 5000000.0 for Bank deposit, and 8000000.0 for Fixed Assets\n- This appears to be a legitimate setup of initial account values rather than an inconsistency\n\nNo other clear inconsistencies are found when comparing the invoice descriptions with the recorded values in other transactions.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-31', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-23', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '1160.91', 'Recorded price': '961.67', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240131092'} }\n```",
