The recorded quantity is 3 units, but the invoice mentions 4 units\n2. The recorded payment/receipt_status is \"Paid\", but the invoice states it was \"unpaid\"\n3. The recorded profit is $12080.20, but based on the invoice information, it should be $12593.60\n\nHere is my final solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"4.00\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"3.00\", \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": \"12593.60\", \"Recorded profit\": \"12080.20\", \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240111034\"}}\n```",
