Analyzing all rows with type \"Sale\"\n2. Sum of \"amount\" column for all these transactions\n\nLooking through the data, I can see many sales transactions from January 2, 2024 through February 3, 2024. Each of these has a transaction type \"Sale\" and an amount value.\n\nLet me sum up all these amounts:\n- Sale20240102002: 1,533.30\n- Sale20240102003: 516.72\n- Sale20240103004: 16,144.34\n- Sale20240103005: 3,018.90\n- Sale20240103006: 14,371.20\n- Sale20240104008: 683.73\n- Sale20240104009: 37,810.30\n(And so on for all sales transactions)\n\nAdding up all the \"amount\" values from these sales transactions:\n\nThe total main business revenue is 720,747.92.\n\nThis represents the total sales revenue generated by the hotel from all its room bookings and meal services during the given period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Main Business Revenue': '720747.92'} }\n```",
