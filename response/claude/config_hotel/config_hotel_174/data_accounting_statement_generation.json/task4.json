In the transaction data, I need to identify sales marked as \"Account Receivable\" (sometimes misspelled as \"Account Receviable\") under the receive_method column.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the initial accounts receivable value\nLooking at the first few transactions with date 2023-12-31, which represent the initial balances, I don't see any initial accounts receivable entries. This suggests the company started with zero accounts receivable.\n\n## Step 3: Identify all sales on credit (accounts receivable)\nNow I'll identify all sales transactions with \"Account Receviable\" or similar as the receive_method:\n\n- Sale20240102002: 1,533.30 (Business Meal Set to C013)\n- Sale20240103005: 3,018.90 (Business Meal Set to C019)\n- Sale20240104008: 683.73 (Quick Meal Set to C010)\n- Sale20240106017: 10,935.12 (Business Room to C013)\n- Sale20240106018: 5,160.92 (Deluxe Meal Set to C004)\n- Sale20240107023: 1,918.00 (Business Meal Set to C005)\n- Sale20240107024: 3,501.72 (Business Room to C011)\n- Sale20240108025: 10,708.95 (Standard Room to C007)\n- Sale20240110030: 1,129.20 (Quick Meal Set to C011)\n- Sale20240111034: 32,593.60 (Luxury Suite to C008)\n- Sale20240112036: 26,381.40 (Luxury Suite to C018)\n- Sale20240112038: 10,064.80 (Standard Room to C012)\n- Sale20240113040: 2,638.70 (Business Meal Set to C011)\n- Sale20240114041: 6,765.80 (Deluxe Meal Set to C017)\n- Sale20240114043: 3,576.03 (Deluxe Meal Set to C020)\n- Sale20240115046: 21,327.57 (Luxury Suite to C005)\n- Sale20240117051: 17,427.44 (Banquet Set to C020)\n- Sale20240117053: 8,584.98 (Banquet Set to C004)\n- Sale20240118054: 2,528.38 (Standard Room to C010)\n- Sale20240118055: 20,331.64 (Banquet Set to C006)\n- Sale20240119057: 4,021.32 (Deluxe Meal Set to C010)\n- Sale20240120060: 2,244.08 (Business Meal Set to C006)\n- Sale20240120061: 3,165.33 (Business Room to C005)\n- Sale20240123067: 2,450.56 (Deluxe Meal Set to C002)\n- Sale20240125075: 8,402.40 (Business Room to C002)\n- Sale20240126077: 13,709.55 (Business Room to C014)\n- Sale20240127080: 6,272.12 (Deluxe Meal Set to C010)\n- Sale20240129086: 2,834.20 (Deluxe Meal Set to C007)\n- Sale20240131091: 14,630.35 (Business Room to C019)\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total accounts receivable at the end of the period\nAdding up all these values:\n\nTotal accounts receivable = 248,540.09\n\n## Step 5: Check for reductions in accounts receivable\nI need to check if any of these receivables were later paid off, which would reduce the accounts receivable balance. Looking through the data, I don't see any payments against these specific receivables.\n\n## Step 6: Verify the initial value\nConfirming that there were no pre-existing accounts receivable on 2023-12-31, the initial value is 0.00.\n\n## Step 7: Verify the end value\nThe final accounts receivable value is the sum of all unpaid sales using the \"Account Receivable\" method, which is 248,540.09.\n\nLet me format the answer according to the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accounts Receivable End Value': '248540.09'}}\n```",
