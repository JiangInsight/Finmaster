                        "content": "I'll solve this task by calculating the final inventory item in the cash flow statement. This represents the change in inventory during the period.\n\nStep 1: First, I need to identify all purchase transactions that represent inventory additions.\n\nLooking at the data, all transactions with type \"Purchase\" represent inventory additions. These are products the business purchased to resell (like rooms, meals, etc.).\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total inventory purchased during the period.\n\nLet me sum up all the \"Purchase\" transactions:\n- 680,000.00 (Luxury Suite)\n- 80,500.00 (Business Meal Set)\n- 342,000.00 (Business Room)\n- 43,350.00 (Quick Meal Set)\n- 1,480,000.00 (Luxury Suite)\n- 406,000.00 (Business Room)\n- 137,280.00 (Deluxe Meal Set)\n- 1,310,000.00 (Luxury Suite)\n- 763,200.00 (Banquet Set)\n- 315,000.00 (Standard Room)\n- 36,450.00 (Quick Meal Set)\n- 288,000.00 (Business Room)\n- 103,600.00 (Business Meal Set)\n- 339,000.00 (Standard Room)\n- 132,880.00 (Deluxe Meal Set)\n- 665,280.00 (Banquet Set)\n- 230,560.00 (Deluxe Meal Set)\n- 316,500.00 (Standard Room)\n- 57,750.00 (Business Meal Set)\n- 299,520.00 (Banquet Set)\n- 348,000.00 (Business Room)\n\nTotal inventory purchased = 7,974,870.00\n\nStep 3: Calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS) during the period.\n\nLooking at all \"Sale\" transactions, I need to sum up the \"cost_amount\" field, which represents the cost of inventory sold:\n\nTotal COGS = 600,370.00\n\nStep 4: Calculate the change in inventory.\n\nIn a cash flow statement, the inventory change is calculated as:\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory = COGS - Purchases\n\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory = 600,370.00 - 7,974,870.00 = -7,374,500.00\n\nSince this is negative, it represents an increase in inventory (using cash). For cash flow statement purposes, we show this as a negative number because it's a use of cash.\n\nLet me verify:\n- Beginning inventory + Purchases - COGS = Ending inventory\n- 0 + 7,974,870.00 - 600,370.00 = 7,374,500.00\n\nThis confirms that inventory increased by 7,374,500.00 during the period.\n\nTherefore, in the cash flow statement, this would appear as:\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory = -7,374,500.00\n\nHowever, to ensure complete accuracy, I'll make sure I didn't miss any transactions by looking more carefully at the data again.\n\nUpon recalculating and verifying all purchase transactions, I get a revised total of purchases = 7,974,870.00 and COGS = 600,370.00\n\nTherefore:\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory = -7,374,500.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-7374500.00'}}\n```",
