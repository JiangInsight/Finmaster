Cash and Bank changes:\n   - Cash/bank deposits (initial)\n   - Cash sales (inflow)\n   - Cash purchases/expenses (outflow)\n   - Transfers between cash and bank\n\n2. Accounts Receivable:\n   - Sales with \"Account Receivable\" payment method (increase)\n   - Any collections of accounts receivable (decrease)\n\n3. Interest Receivable:\n   - Interest accruals\n   \n4. Inventory:\n   - Initial purchases\n   - Cost of goods sold\n\nAfter careful analysis of all transactions, I can calculate:\n\n- Initial cash: 3,000,000.00\n- Initial bank: 5,000,000.00\n- Total initial current assets: 8,000,000.00\n\nFor the final current assets, tracking all cash inflows, outflows, bank transfers, receivables, and inventory changes through January 2024, I find:\n\n- Final cash: 1,321,180.24\n- Final bank: 5,550,000.00\n- Accounts receivable: 151,022.78\n- Interest receivable: 5,080.46\n- Inventory: 929,522.99\n- Total final current assets: 7,956,806.47\n\nTherefore, my solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Total Current Assets End Value': '7956806.47'}}\n```",
