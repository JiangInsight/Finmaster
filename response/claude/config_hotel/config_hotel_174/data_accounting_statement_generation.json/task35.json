Looking at \"Sale\" transactions to calculate total revenue\n2. The revenue is the total amount of all sales\n\n## Cost Analysis\n1. For \"Cost of Goods Sold\", I need to sum the cost_amount from all sale transactions\n\n## Expense Analysis\n1. Administrative Expenses: Sum all \"Administrative Expenses\" transactions\n2. Sales Expenses: Sum all \"Sales Expenses\" transactions\n3. Depreciation: Sum all \"Depreciation\" transactions\n4. Financial Expenses: Sum all \"Financial Expenses\" transactions\n\n## Interest Income\n1. Sum all \"Interest Receivables\" transactions\n\n## Tax\n1. Sum all tax_amount fields from sale transactions\n\nNow, let me calculate the totals for each category:\n\n### Revenue Calculation\nLooking at all sale transactions (type = \"Sale\"), the total sum of the \"amount\" field is the Main Business Revenue.\n\n### Cost of Goods Sold\nFor all sale transactions, I'll sum the \"cost_amount\" field.\n\n### Expense Categories\nFor each expense type, I'll sum the respective transaction amounts.\n\n### Interest Income\nSum all interest receivable transaction amounts.\n\n### Tax Calculation\nSum all tax_amount fields from sale transactions.\n\nLet me perform the calculations:\n\n```\nMain Business Revenue: 720,070.93\nCost of Goods Sold: 476,880.00\nGross Profit: 243,190.93\n\nAdministrative Expenses: 11,407.15\nSales Expenses: 9,798.94\nDepreciation: 117,540.62\nFinancial Expenses: 3,193.59\nTotal Expenses: 141,940.30\n\nInterest Income: 4,490.29\n\nProfit Before Tax: 105,740.92\nTax Expense: 36,003.54\nNet Profit: 69,737.38\n```\n\nLet me double-check my calculations:\n\n1. Main Business Revenue (all sales): 720,070.93\n2. Cost of Goods Sold: 476,880.00\n3. Gross Profit (Revenue - COGS): 243,190.93\n4. Total Expenses: 141,940.30\n5. Interest Income: 4,490.29\n6. Profit Before Tax (Gross Profit + Interest Income - Total Expenses): 105,740.92\n7. Tax Expense: 36,003.54\n8. Net Profit (Profit Before Tax - Tax Expense): 69,737.38\n\n{\"solution\": {'Main Business Revenue': '720070.93', 'Total Revenue': '720070.93', 'Cost of Goods Sold': '476880.00', 'Total Cost': '476880.00', 'Gross Profit': '243190.93', 'Administrative Expenses': '11407.15', 'Selling Expenses': '9798.94', 'Depreciation': '117540.62', 'Financial Expenses': '3193.59', 'Total Expenses': '141940.30', 'Interest Income': '4490.29', 'Profit Before Tax': '105740.92', 'Tax Expense': '36003.54', 'Net Profit': '69737.38'} }",
