Let me analyze the data step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Identify Key Cash Flow Components\n\nFirst, I need to understand the initial cash position, operating cash flows, investing activities, and financing activities.\n\n### Initial Cash Position:\n- Cash deposit: $3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: $5,000,000.00\n- Total beginning balance: $8,000,000.00\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Net Profit/Loss from Operations\n\nTo determine the net profit, I'll categorize the income and expense transactions.\n\n### Income (Sales):\nAll sales transactions from January 1 to February 3, 2024.\n\n### Expenses:\n- Administrative expenses\n- Sales expenses\n- Financial expenses\n- Depreciation\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Changes in Working Capital\n\n### Accounts Receivable:\nAll sales marked as \"Unpaid\" with receive method \"Account Receivable\"\n\n### Interest Receivable:\nAll interest receivable transactions\n\n### Inventory:\nAll purchase transactions\n\n### Accounts Payable:\nAll purchases marked as \"Unpaid\" with payment method \"Account Payable\"\n\n### Tax Payable:\nTax amounts from sales transactions\n\n## Step 4: Identify Investing Activities\n\n### Fixed Assets:\n- Initial fixed assets: $8,000,000.00\n- Additional fixed asset purchases:\n  - Central AC: $928,991.43\n  - Renovation Project: $1,567,146.49\n  \nTotal fixed asset purchases: $2,496,137.92\n\n## Step 5: Identify Cash Transfers\n\nCash to bank transfers totaling $150,000.00\n\n## Step 6: Calculate Final Cash Balance\n\nAfter computing all the cash flows, I'll determine the ending cash balance.\n\nBased on my analysis of the transactions, here's the complete cash flow statement:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Net Profit\": \"292,747.91\",\n    \"Depreciation\": \"117,540.62\",\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-205,211.93\",\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-4,363.70\",\n    \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-6,048,240.00\",\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"2,864,330.00\",\n    \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"35,642.87\",\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-2,947,554.23\",\n    \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"2,496,137.92\",\n    \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-2,496,137.92\",\n    \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Beginning Balance\": \"8,000,000.00\",\n    \"Ending Balance\": \"2,556,307.85\",\n    \"Net Increase\": \"-5,443,692.15\"\n}}\n```",
