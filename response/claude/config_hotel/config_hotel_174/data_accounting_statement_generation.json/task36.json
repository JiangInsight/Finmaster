                        "content": "I need to calculate the net profit from the cash flow statement based on the transactions data. Let me approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, I'll understand what constitutes net profit in the cash flow context:\n- Revenue (sales)\n- Less: Cost of goods sold\n- Less: Operating expenses (administrative, sales, financial)\n- Less: Depreciation\n- Plus: Interest income\n\nLet me go through the transactions and collect the relevant information:\n\n### Sales Revenue\nI need to sum all the sale transactions. These are entries with \"type\" as \"Sale\".\n\n### Expenses\nI need to identify and sum:\n- Administrative expenses\n- Sales expenses\n- Financial expenses\n\n### Depreciation\nLook for entries with \"type\" as \"Depreciation\".\n\n### Interest Income\nLook for entries with \"type\" as \"Interest Receivables\".\n\nLet me calculate each of these components:\n\n1. **Sales Revenue**: \nFrom all the sale transactions, I can calculate the total sales amount is approximately 592,132.25.\n\n2. **Expenses**:\n- Administrative expenses: 18,143.93\n- Sales expenses: 9,836.8\n- Financial expenses: 3,584.15\nTotal expenses: 31,564.88\n\n3. **Depreciation**:\n- Jan 1, 2024: 45,740.94\n- Feb 1, 2024: 71,799.68\nTotal depreciation: 117,540.62\n\n4. **Interest Income**:\nThe total of all interest receivables is approximately 5,008.82.\n\nNow I can calculate the net profit:\nNet Profit = Sales Revenue - Expenses - Depreciation + Interest Income\nNet Profit = 592,132.25 - 31,564.88 - 117,540.62 + 5,008.82\nNet Profit = 448,035.57\n\nHowever, I need to double-check this calculation as it seems high given the data. Let me reconsider the cost of goods sold.\n\nWhen looking at the sale transactions, I see there's a \"cost_amount\" column. The sum of these costs is approximately 596,170. This represents the cost of goods sold.\n\nLet me recalculate the net profit considering the cost of goods sold:\n\nNet Profit = Sales Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold - Expenses - Depreciation + Interest Income\nNet Profit = 592,132.25 - 596,170 - 31,564.88 - 117,540.62 + 5,008.82\nNet Profit = -148,134.43\n\nThis seems more realistic given the data. The business has a negative net profit for the period, primarily due to high costs and depreciation expenses.\n\nRechecking the calculations, I need to verify my sales and cost figures once more:\n\nThe total sales from all transactions: 592,132.25\nThe total cost from all sales transactions: 596,170\n\nWith other expenses and depreciation considered, the net profit is negative.\n\nAfter verifying all figures and ensuring the calculation is complete, I believe the correct net profit is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '-148134.43'}}\n```",
