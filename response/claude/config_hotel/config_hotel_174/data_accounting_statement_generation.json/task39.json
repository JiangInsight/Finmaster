This will involve analyzing all interest receivable transactions during the period.\n\nStep 1: First, I need to identify all interest receivable transactions in the data. These are transactions with the type \"Interest Receivables\".\n\nStep 2: Then I'll calculate the change in interest receivable during the period. For a cash flow statement, we need the (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable, which is:\n- Beginning balance - Ending balance\n\nIf the result is negative, it means there was an increase in interest receivable (which is a use of cash).\nIf the result is positive, it means there was a decrease in interest receivable (which is a source of cash).\n\nStep 3: Let's extract and analyze all interest receivable transactions:\n\nDate | Amount\n-----|-------\n2024-01-01 | 445.00\n2024-01-02 | 445.00\n2024-01-03 | 445.00\n2024-01-04 | 313.28\n2024-01-05 | 313.28\n2024-01-06 | 245.3552\n2024-01-07 | 245.3552\n2024-01-08 | 215.18419999999998\n2024-01-09 | 215.18419999999998\n2024-01-10 | 215.18419999999998\n2024-01-11 | 215.18419999999998\n2024-01-12 | 215.18419999999998\n2024-01-13 | 215.18419999999998\n2024-01-14 | 132.50396272999998\n2024-01-15 | 132.50396272999998\n2024-01-16 | 132.50396272999998\n2024-01-17 | 132.50396272999998\n2024-01-18 | 132.50396272999998\n2024-01-19 | 132.50396272999998\n2024-01-20 | 132.50396272999998\n2024-01-21 | 132.50396272999998\n2024-01-22 | 132.50396272999998\n2024-01-23 | 132.50396272999998\n2024-01-24 | 132.50396272999998\n2024-01-25 | 6.377925119999985\n2024-01-26 | 6.377925119999985\n2024-01-27 | 6.377925119999985\n2024-01-28 | 6.377925119999985\n2024-01-29 | 6.377925119999985\n2024-01-30 | 6.377925119999985\n2024-01-31 | 6.377925119999985\n2024-02-01 | 6.377925119999985\n2024-02-02 | 6.377925119999985\n2024-02-03 | 6.377925119999985\n\nStep 4: Now let's calculate the beginning and ending balances.\n\nSince the first interest receivable transaction was on 2024-01-01 with an amount of 445.00, and there's no previous balance mentioned, I'll assume the beginning balance was 0.\n\nFor the ending balance, I need to sum all interest receivable transactions that were recorded as \"Unpaid\" (meaning they were accrued but not received):\n- All of these transactions are marked as \"Unpaid\"\n- The ending balance should be the sum of all these transactions\n\nThe sum of all these interest receivable amounts is:\n445.00 + 445.00 + 445.00 + 313.28 + 313.28 + 245.3552 + 245.3552 + 215.18419999999998 + 215.18419999999998 + 215.18419999999998 + 215.18419999999998 + 215.18419999999998 + 215.18419999999998 + 132.50396272999998 + 132.50396272999998 + 132.50396272999998 + 132.50396272999998 + 132.50396272999998 + 132.50396272999998 + 132.50396272999998 + 132.50396272999998 + 132.50396272999998 + 132.50396272999998 + 132.50396272999998 + 6.377925119999985 + 6.377925119999985 + 6.377925119999985 + 6.377925119999985 + 6.377925119999985 + 6.377925119999985 + 6.377925119999985 + 6.377925119999985 + 6.377925119999985 + 6.377925119999985 = 5345.87\n\nStep 5: Calculate the (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\nBeginning balance: 0\nEnding balance: 5345.87\n(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable = 0 - 5345.87 = -5345.87\n\nThis negative number indicates an increase in interest receivable during the period, which is a use of cash in the cash flow statement. According to the required format, I need to show this as a negative number.\n\nHowever, I need to double-check this because there might be another approach. Let me reconsider:\n\nFor cash flow statements, the interest receivable line shows the change in the interest receivable balance, not the sum of all transactions. So I should look at the starting balance and ending balance.\n\nSince there's no explicit starting balance provided, I should use the difference between the ending balance and the new interest receivable accrued during the period.\n\nThe ending balance of interest receivable as of February 3, 2024 would be the interest that has been accrued but not yet received. Since all the transactions are marked \"Unpaid,\" the 6.377925119999985 amount on February 3, 2024 represents the current unpaid interest receivable.\n\nSo the (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable = -(6.377925119999985 - 0) = -6.38\n\nOn second thought, I think I need to reconsider my approach again. The transactions represent flows, not balances. \n\nLooking more carefully at the data, I see that each day has a new interest receivable entry. These are all marked \"Unpaid\" which means they represent interest that has been accrued but not collected. For a cash flow statement, we need to show how much the interest receivable balance increased during the period.\n\nThe beginning interest receivable balance would be 0 (assuming no interest receivable existed before the first transaction on January 1).\n\nThe ending interest receivable balance would be the sum of all interest receivable transactions during the period (since they're all unpaid): 5345.87\n\nTherefore: (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable = 0 - 5345.87 = -5345.87\n\nHowever, looking at the example provided, where the answer is '-2672.87', I need to take a different approach. This value seems to be approximately half of my calculated total, suggesting there might be a specific date range or calculation method.\n\nTo match the example's format, I'll round to 2 decimal places:\n-5345.87 rounded to 2 decimal places is -5345.87\n\nLet me check again: the sum of all interest receivable transactions is 5345.87. If I assume I'm looking at a single month and all of these are accruals, then the change in interest receivable is -5345.87.\n\nI need to reconsider. Looking at the format of the answer in the example (-2672.87), it seems likely that there was a beginning balance not explicitly stated. Without more information about the beginning balance, I'll use my best judgment based on the data available.\n\nThe decrease would be the difference between any interest collected (zero in this case as all are marked \"Unpaid\") and the new interest accrued (5345.87).\n\nTherefore, the (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable is -5345.87.\n\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-5345.87'} }",
