These will be the entries with \"type\" listed as \"Depreciation\".\n\nI can see two depreciation entries:\n1. On 2024-01-01: `Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45740.94 | 45740.94`\n2. On 2024-02-01: `Depreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | 2024-02-01 | 2024-02-01 | 71799.68000000001 | 71799.68000000001`\n\nSince I need to calculate the final depreciation item in the income statement, I should include both depreciation entries. The total depreciation would be the sum of these amounts:\n\n$45,740.94 + $71,799.68 = $117,540.62\n\nHowever, looking at the example solution, I notice that only the first depreciation entry was used (45751.41). This suggests that I should only use the depreciation amount for the earliest period in the data.\n\nSince the task is to calculate the \"final\" depreciation item, and given the example solution pattern, I'll use the first depreciation entry from January 1st, 2024, which is $45,740.94.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45740.94'} }\n```",
