The transactions with \"Initial\" in their IDs and dated 2023-12-31 represent the initial capital:\n\n- Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | 3,000,000.0\n- Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 5,000,000.0\n- Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 8,000,000.0\n\nAdding these up: 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 16,000,000.00\n\n## Step 2: Identify any additional paid-in capital transactions\nI need to examine if there were any additional capital contributions or withdrawals during the period. Looking through the transactions data:\n\n- There are no additional capital contributions marked with types like \"Capital Contribution\" or \"Equity Investment\"\n- There are no capital withdrawals or reductions\n- The transactions are mostly regular business operations (sales, purchases, expenses, etc.) which don't affect paid-in capital\n\n## Step 3: Determine the final paid-in capital amount\nSince there are no additional capital contributions or withdrawals identified in the transaction data, the final paid-in capital remains the same as the initial value.\n\nInitial Paid-in Capital: 16,000,000.00\nFinal Paid-in Capital: 16,000,000.00\n\nTherefore, both the initial and final amounts of paid-in capital are 16,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '16000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '16000000.00'}}\n```",
