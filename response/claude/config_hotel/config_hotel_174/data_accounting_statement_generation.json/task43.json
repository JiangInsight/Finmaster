                        "content": "I need to calculate the net cash flow from operating activities based on the transactions data. The cash flow from operating activities includes cash inflows and outflows related to the company's core business operations.\n\nLet me analyze the transactions systematically:\n\n### Step 1: Identify operating cash flows\nI'll need to identify:\n- Cash received from customers (sales that are paid)\n- Cash paid for inventory (purchases that are paid)\n- Cash paid for operating expenses\n- Other operating cash flows\n\n### Step 2: Determine which transactions affect operating cash flows\n- Cash sales and collections from customers\n- Cash payments for inventory\n- Cash payments for operating expenses (administrative, sales, financial)\n- Cash receipts from interest (operating)\n- Cash payments for interest (operating)\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the transactions data\n\n1. Cash inflows from Sales (marked as \"Paid\"):\n   - All sales transactions with payment_status \"Paid\" represent cash inflows\n\n2. Cash outflows for Purchases (marked as \"Paid\"):\n   - All purchase transactions with payment_status \"Paid\" represent cash outflows\n\n3. Cash outflows for Expenses:\n   - All expense transactions (Administrative, Sales, Financial Expenses) represent cash outflows\n\n4. Transfers between Cash and Bank:\n   - These are internal transfers that don't affect net cash flow\n\n5. Initial deposits and fixed assets purchases:\n   - Initial deposits are not operating activities\n   - Fixed assets purchases are investing activities, not operating activities\n\n6. Depreciation:\n   - This is a non-cash expense (needs to be added back)\n\n7. Interest receivables:\n   - If unpaid, these don't represent actual cash flows\n\nLet me sum up all the relevant transactions:\n\n#### Cash inflows from sales (Paid):\nAll sales transactions with payment method \"Cash\" = +656,761.20\n\n#### Cash outflows for purchases (Paid):\nAll purchase transactions with payment method \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" that are \"Paid\" = -4,622,880.00\n\n#### Cash outflows for expenses:\nAll expense transactions = -24,640.80\n\n#### Depreciation (add back):\nDepreciation entries = +117,540.62\n\n#### Cash flow from interest:\nInterest received in cash = +0 (all interest receivables are unpaid)\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\nNet Cash Flow = Cash inflows - Cash outflows + Non-cash expenses\n\n= 656,761.20 - 4,622,880.00 - 24,640.80 + 117,540.62\n= -3,873,218.98\n\nLet's double-check my calculation:\n\n- Sales (Paid): +656,761.20\n- Purchases (Paid): -4,622,880.00\n- Expenses: -24,640.80\n- Depreciation (add back): +117,540.62\n- Net: -3,873,218.98\n\nTherefore, the net cash flow from operating activities is -3,873,218.98, which I'll round to -3,873,219.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities': '-3873219.00'}}\n```\n\nWait, I need to re-examine my calculations as they seem incorrect. Let me go through the data more carefully:\n\nFirst, let me correctly identify all cash transactions related to operating activities:\n\n1. Cash sales (where payment method = \"Cash\"): +656,761.20\n2. Cash purchases (where payment method = \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" and status = \"Paid\"): -4,622,880.00\n3. All expense payments (all appear to be paid in cash): -24,640.80\n4. Add back depreciation (non-cash expense): +117,540.62\n\nThe net cash flow from operating activities is:\n+656,761.20 - 4,622,880.00 - 24,640.80 + 117,540.62 = -3,873,218.98\n\nRounding to two decimal places: -3,873,218.98\n\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities': '-3873218.98'}}",
