ROE measures how efficiently a company uses its equity to generate profits.\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\nROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity × 100%\n\nLet me gather the required information from the statements:\n\n1. Net Income (from income statement): $111,731.83\n2. Initial Shareholders' Equity (from balance sheet): $16,000,000.00\n3. Ending Shareholders' Equity (from balance sheet): $16,111,731.83\n\nNow I'll calculate the average shareholders' equity:\nAverage Shareholders' Equity = (Initial + Ending) / 2\nAverage Shareholders' Equity = ($16,000,000.00 + $16,111,731.83) / 2\nAverage Shareholders' Equity = $16,055,865.92\n\nNow I can calculate ROE:\nROE = $111,731.83 / $16,055,865.92 × 100%\nROE = 0.6958% (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\nExpressed as a percentage with two decimal places:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.70%'}}\n```",
