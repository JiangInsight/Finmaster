Operating Cash Flow: From the cash flow statement, I can see that the \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" is -4,504,752.68\n\n2. Current Liabilities: From the balance sheet, \"Total Current Liabilities\" is 3,389,719.66\n\nNow I'll calculate the ratio:\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n= -4,504,752.68 / 3,389,719.66\n= -1.3289 (or approximately -1.33)\n\nThis means that for every $1 of current liabilities, the company is generating -$1.33 in operating cash flow, which indicates the company is not generating positive cash from operations to cover its short-term obligations.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.33'} }\n```",
