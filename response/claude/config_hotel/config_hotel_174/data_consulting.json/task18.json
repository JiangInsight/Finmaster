Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities (from cash flow statement): -$4,504,752.68\n2. Total Current Liabilities (from balance sheet, end amount): $3,389,719.66\n\nNow, let's calculate the ratio:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$4,504,752.68 / $3,389,719.66 = -1.33\n\nLet me round this to two decimal places:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -1.33\n\nTherefore, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is -1.33, indicating that the company's operating cash flow is negative and insufficient to cover its current liabilities.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.33'} }\n```",
