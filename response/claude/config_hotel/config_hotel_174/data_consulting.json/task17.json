                        "content": "I need to calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio, which measures a company's ability to pay off its debt using operating cash flow.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the components needed for this calculation:\n\n1. Cash Flow from Operating Activities: This is clearly listed in the cash flow statement as \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" = -4,504,752.68\n\n2. Total Debt: This refers to the company's total liabilities, which comes from the balance sheet. Looking at the \"Total Current Liabilities\" = 3,389,719.66. Since there are no long-term liabilities listed, this represents the total debt.\n\nThe Cash Flow to Debt Ratio formula is:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Cash Flow from Operating Activities รท Total Debt\n\nCalculating:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -4,504,752.68 รท 3,389,719.66 = -1.33\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.33'} }\n```",
