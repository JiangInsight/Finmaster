                        "content": "I'll calculate the three financial ratios step by step based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio measures the proportion of debt used to finance assets relative to the value of shareholders' equity.\n\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $3,389,719.66\n- Total Shareholders' Equity = $16,111,731.83\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $3,389,719.66 / $16,111,731.83 = 0.2104 ≈ 0.21\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\nThis ratio measures how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue.\n\nFormula: (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = $111,731.83\n- Total Revenue = $791,992.51\n\nNet Profit Margin = ($111,731.83 / $791,992.51) × 100% = 14.107% ≈ 14.11%\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from operations.\n\nFormula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the financial statements:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$4,504,752.68\n- Total Current Liabilities = $3,389,719.66\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -$4,504,752.68 / $3,389,719.66 = -1.3289 ≈ -1.33\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21', 'Net Profit Margin': '14.11%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.33'}}\n```",
