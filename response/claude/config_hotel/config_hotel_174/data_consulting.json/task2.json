The Quick Ratio measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations without relying on inventory.\n\nThe formula for Quick Ratio is:\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nStep 1: Identify the Current Assets at the end of the reporting period.\n- Total Current Assets = $9,122,854.19\n\nStep 2: Subtract Inventory from Current Assets.\n- Inventory = $7,869,940.00\n- Current Assets - Inventory = $9,122,854.19 - $7,869,940.00 = $1,252,914.19\n\nStep 3: Identify the Current Liabilities at the end of the reporting period.\n- Total Current Liabilities = $3,389,719.66\n\nStep 4: Calculate the Quick Ratio.\n- Quick Ratio = $1,252,914.19 / $3,389,719.66 = 0.36961...\n\nStep 5: Round to two decimal places.\n- Quick Ratio = 0.37\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '0.37'}}\n```",
