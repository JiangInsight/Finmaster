The formula is:\n\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities\n\nStep 1: Identify the cash and cash equivalents from the balance sheet.\n- Cash on Hand: $927,447.32\n- Bank Deposits: $71,662.08\n- Total Cash and Cash Equivalents: $927,447.32 + $71,662.08 = $999,109.40\n\nStep 2: Identify the current liabilities from the balance sheet.\n- Total Current Liabilities: $3,389,719.66\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Cash to Current Debt Ratio.\n- Cash to Current Debt Ratio = $999,109.40 / $3,389,719.66 = 0.2947\n\nStep 4: Round to 2 decimal places.\n- Cash to Current Debt Ratio = 0.29\n\nTherefore, the company has $0.29 in cash and cash equivalents for every $1 of current liabilities.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '0.29'} }\n```",
