                        "content": "I'll calculate the five financial ratios based on the provided financial statements. Let me work through each one step by step.\n\n## 1. Current Ratio\nThe current ratio is calculated as Current Assets / Current Liabilities.\n- Current Assets = $9,122,854.19\n- Current Liabilities = $3,389,719.66\n- Current Ratio = $9,122,854.19 / $3,389,719.66 = 2.69\n\n## 2. Quick Ratio\nThe quick ratio is calculated as (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities.\n- Current Assets = $9,122,854.19\n- Inventory = $7,869,940.00\n- Current Liabilities = $3,389,719.66\n- Quick Ratio = ($9,122,854.19 - $7,869,940.00) / $3,389,719.66 = $1,252,914.19 / $3,389,719.66 = 0.37\n\n## 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\nThe debt to asset ratio is calculated as Total Liabilities / Total Assets.\n- Total Liabilities = $3,389,719.66\n- Total Assets = $19,501,451.49\n- Debt to Asset Ratio = $3,389,719.66 / $19,501,451.49 = 0.17\n\n## 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThe debt to equity ratio is calculated as Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity.\n- Total Liabilities = $3,389,719.66\n- Total Owner's Equity = $16,111,731.83\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = $3,389,719.66 / $16,111,731.83 = 0.21\n\n## 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nThe cash flow to debt ratio is calculated as Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Liabilities.\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$4,504,752.68\n- Total Liabilities = $3,389,719.66\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -$4,504,752.68 / $3,389,719.66 = -1.33\n\nNow I'll present the solution in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Current Ratio\": \"2.69\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.37\", \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.17\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.21\", \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-1.33\"}}\n```",
