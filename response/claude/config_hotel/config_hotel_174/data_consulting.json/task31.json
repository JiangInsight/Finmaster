                        "content": "I need to calculate several financial ratios based on the provided financial statements. Let me work through each ratio step by step.\n\n1. **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio**\n   - This ratio measures how efficiently a company collects revenue from customers\n   - Formula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n   - Net Credit Sales = Main Business Revenue = $791,992.51\n   - Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2 = (0 + $248,540.09) / 2 = $124,270.05\n   - Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $791,992.51 / $124,270.05 = 6.37\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**\n   - This ratio measures a company's ability to pay off short-term liabilities with operating cash flow\n   - Formula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n   - Operating Cash Flow = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$4,504,752.68\n   - Current Liabilities = $3,389,719.66\n   - Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -$4,504,752.68 / $3,389,719.66 = -1.33\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio**\n   - This is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n   - Ratio = -1.33\n\n4. **Total Asset Turnover Ratio**\n   - This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales\n   - Formula: Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n   - Net Sales = $791,992.51\n   - Average Total Assets = (Beginning Assets + Ending Assets) / 2 = ($16,000,000 + $19,501,451.49) / 2 = $17,750,725.75\n   - Total Asset Turnover Ratio = $791,992.51 / $17,750,725.75 = 0.04\n\n5. **Debt to Equity Ratio**\n   - This ratio measures a company's financial leverage\n   - Formula: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n   - Total Liabilities = $3,389,719.66\n   - Total Equity = $16,111,731.83\n   - Debt to Equity Ratio = $3,389,719.66 / $16,111,731.83 = 0.21\n\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '6.37', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-1.33', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.33', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.04', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21'} }",
