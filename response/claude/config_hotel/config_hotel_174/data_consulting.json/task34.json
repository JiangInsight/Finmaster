Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis measures the ability to cover current liabilities with operating cash flow.\n- Operating Cash Flow = -4,504,752.68\n- Current Liabilities = 3,389,719.66\n- Ratio = -4,504,752.68 ÷ 3,389,719.66 = -1.33\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures the company's financial leverage.\n- Total Liabilities = 3,389,719.66\n- Total Equity = 16,111,731.83\n- Ratio = 3,389,719.66 ÷ 16,111,731.83 = 0.21\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n- Revenue = 791,992.51\n- Total Assets = 19,501,451.49\n- Ratio = 791,992.51 ÷ 19,501,451.49 = 0.04\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\nThis measures a company's short-term liquidity.\n- Quick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 9,122,854.19 - 7,869,940.00 = 1,252,914.19\n- Current Liabilities = 3,389,719.66\n- Ratio = 1,252,914.19 ÷ 3,389,719.66 = 0.37\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n- Ratio = -1.33\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\nThis measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholders' equity.\n- Net Income = 111,731.83\n- Shareholders' Equity = 16,111,731.83\n- ROE = (111,731.83 ÷ 16,111,731.83) × 100% = 0.69%\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company collects revenue.\n- Revenue = 791,992.51\n- Accounts Receivable = 248,540.09\n- Ratio = 791,992.51 ÷ 248,540.09 = 3.19\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.33', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.04', 'Quick Ratio': '0.37', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.33', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.69%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.19'} }\n```",
