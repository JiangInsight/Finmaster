                        "content": "I'll calculate these three financial ratios step by step using the provided financial statements.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nThis ratio compares the cash flow from operations to net income. It measures how much cash is generated from operations relative to reported net income.\n\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Income\n\nFrom the statements:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$4,504,752.68\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = $111,731.83\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = -$4,504,752.68 / $111,731.83 = -40.32\n\n## 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\nThis measures how efficiently a company is using its current assets to generate revenue.\n\nFormula: Current Assets Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Current Assets\n\nAverage Current Assets = (Initial Current Assets + Ending Current Assets) / 2\nAverage Current Assets = ($8,000,000 + $9,122,854.19) / 2 = $8,561,427.10\n\nTotal Revenue = $791,992.51\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = $791,992.51 / $8,561,427.10 = 0.09\n\n## 3. Quick Ratio\n\nThe quick ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without relying on inventory sales.\n\nFormula: Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = $9,122,854.19\n- Inventory = $7,869,940.00\n- Current Liabilities = $3,389,719.66\n\nQuick Ratio = ($9,122,854.19 - $7,869,940.00) / $3,389,719.66\nQuick Ratio = $1,252,914.19 / $3,389,719.66 = 0.37\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-40.32\", \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.09\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.37\"}}\n```",
