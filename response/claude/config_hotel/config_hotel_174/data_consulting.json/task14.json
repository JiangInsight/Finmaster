In this case, I'll use the \"Main Business Revenue\" from the income statement, assuming all sales are on credit.\nNet Credit Sales = $791,992.51\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Average Accounts Receivable.\nBeginning Accounts Receivable = $0.00 (from Initial_amount)\nEnding Accounts Receivable = $248,540.09 (from End_amount)\nAverage Accounts Receivable = ($0.00 + $248,540.09) / 2 = $124,270.05\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio.\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $791,992.51 / $124,270.05 = 6.37\n\nI'll round to two decimal places: 6.37\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '6.37'} }\n```",
