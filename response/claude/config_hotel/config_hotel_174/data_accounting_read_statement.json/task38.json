Therefore, I need to look for the line item related to Accounts Receivable in the cash flow statement.\n\nIn the cash flow statement provided, I can see:\n\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable: -248540.09\"\n\nThe negative value (-248540.09) indicates that the Accounts Receivable increased during the period (since it's labeled as \"(Increase) Decrease\"). An increase in Accounts Receivable means more money is owed to the entity, or in other words, there was a decrease in cash due to more credit sales.\n\nSo the specific line item that shows the decrease in amounts owed (which is actually an increase in Accounts Receivable) is \"-248540.09\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-248540.09'}}\n```",
