Fixed assets are tangible items that:\n1. Have physical substance\n2. Are held for use in operations\n3. Have a useful life extending beyond one accounting period\n\nLooking at the balance sheet provided:\n\n- The \"Fixed Assets\" line item shows:\n  - Initial value: 8000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n  - End value: 10496137.92 (as of 2024-02-03)\n\nThis is the account that represents the tangible assets used in business operations. The accumulated depreciation is listed separately, but that's a contra-asset account showing the depreciation expense on those fixed assets, not the assets themselves.\n\nTherefore, the values I need to extract are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10496137.92'}}\n```",
