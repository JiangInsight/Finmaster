First, I'll check the balance sheet:\n   - I can see \"Accumulated Depreciation\" with an end amount of 117,540.62\n\n2. Next, I'll check the cash flow statement:\n   - There's a \"Depreciation\" line item with an amount of 117,540.62\n\n3. Finally, I'll check the income statement:\n   - I see \"Depreciation\" listed as an expense with the amount of 117,540.62\n\nThe consistent value of 117,540.62 appears across all statements, confirming this is the amount of depreciation expense for the period. This represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of assets over their useful lives.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '117540.62'} }\n```",
