This line item typically represents the costs associated with general management and administration of the entity.\n\nAdministrative expenses usually include costs like:\n- Office rent\n- Utilities\n- Management salaries\n- General office expenses\n- Insurance\n- Legal and professional fees\n- Other overhead costs not directly tied to production or sales\n\nSince the task is asking specifically for the costs of general management and administration, the \"Administrative Expenses\" line item is the appropriate value to extract.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '10432.67'}}\n```",
