The relevant line would typically be labeled as \"Paid-in Capital,\" \"Share Capital,\" \"Common Stock,\" or similar terms.\n\nIn the provided balance sheet, I can see the following line item:\n- Paid-in Capital: 16000000.00 (Initial_amount on 2023-12-31)\n- Paid-in Capital: 16000000.00 (End_amount on 2024-02-03)\n\nThis represents the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares. The value remained the same from the beginning to the end of the reporting period.\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '16000000.00', 'end value': '16000000.00'}}\n```",
