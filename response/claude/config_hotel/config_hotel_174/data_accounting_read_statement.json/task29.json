Looking at the statement, I can see that \"Main Business Revenue\" is the only component of \"Total Revenue\" with the same value of 791992.51.\n\nTherefore:\n- Total income (Total Revenue): 791992.51\n- Sub-item: Main Business Revenue: 791992.51\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '791992.51', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '791992.51'}}}\n```",
