Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement carefully.\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- \"Interest Receivable\" with end amount of 5264.70 represents interest that has accrued but not yet been received.\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- \"Interest Income\" is 5264.70, which matches the Interest Receivable on the Balance Sheet.\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- \"Net Increase\" in Cash and Cash Equivalents is -7000890.60, representing the net change in cash during the period.\n- This is calculated as the difference between the ending balance (999109.40) and beginning balance (8000000.00) of cash and cash equivalents.\n\nTherefore, the values I need to extract are:\n1. Interest accrued but not yet received: 5264.70\n2. Net addition in cash and cash equivalents: -7000890.60\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5264.70', 'value2': '-7000890.60'} }\n```",
