Looking at the balance sheet provided, I can see that the only expense-related item is \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" which represents the accumulated expense of depreciation over time.\n\nIn accounting, accumulated depreciation is a contra-asset account that increases when depreciation expense is recorded. It reflects the total depreciation expense recognized since the asset was acquired.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial value of Accumulated Depreciation (2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End value of Accumulated Depreciation (2024-02-03): 117540.62\n\nThis means that during this period, depreciation expense of 117,540.62 was recognized in the profit and loss statement, increasing the accumulated depreciation from zero to this amount.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '117540.62'}}\n```",
