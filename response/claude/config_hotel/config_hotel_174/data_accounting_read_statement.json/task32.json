Then I need to identify 5 component sub-items that contribute to this calculation.\n\nLooking at the income statement:\n1. The Net Profit is 111731.83\n2. This is calculated as Profit Before Tax (151331.49) minus Tax Expense (39599.66)\n3. The Profit Before Tax is calculated from several components\n\nThe 5 key sub-items that contribute to the Net Profit calculation are:\n1. Total Revenue: 791992.51\n2. Cost of Goods Sold: 504930.00\n3. Total Expenses: 140995.72\n4. Interest Income: 5264.70\n5. Tax Expense: 39599.66\n\nThe formula would be: Net Profit = Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold - Total Expenses + Interest Income - Tax Expense\n791992.51 - 504930.00 - 140995.72 + 5264.70 - 39599.66 = 111731.83\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '111731.83', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '791992.51', 'sub_item value2': '504930.00', 'sub_item value3': '140995.72', 'sub_item value4': '5264.70', 'sub_item value5': '39599.66'}}}\n```",
