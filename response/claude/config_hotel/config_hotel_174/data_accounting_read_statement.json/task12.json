The line item \"Total Current Assets\" shows:\n   - Initial amount: 8,000,000.00 on 2023-12-31\n   - End amount: 9,122,854.19 on 2024-02-03\n\n2. Current assets are comprised of:\n   - Cash on Hand\n   - Bank Deposits\n   - Interest Receivable\n   - Accounts Receivable\n   - Inventory\n\nThese are all assets that are expected to be realized or consumed within the entity's normal operating cycle, which is exactly what the task is asking for.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '9122854.19'}}\n```",
