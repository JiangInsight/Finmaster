This includes:\n- Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.00 (initial), 10,496,137.92 (end)\n- Less: Accumulated Depreciation: 0.00 (initial), 117,540.62 (end)\n\nThe value of \"Total Non-current Assets\" is:\n- Initial value: 8,000,000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- End value: 10,378,597.30 (as of 2024-02-03)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10378597.30'}}\n```",
