The core operating activities of a business typically generate the \"Main Business Revenue\"\n2. In this income statement, \"Main Business Revenue\" is 791992.51\n3. This represents the primary income from the company's normal business operations\n\nThe \"Total Revenue\" also shows the same amount (791992.51), which confirms this is the total income from operations.\n\nOther items like \"Interest Income\" (5264.70) are not part of core operating activities but rather financial/investment activities.\n\nTherefore, the specific value of income arising from core operating activities is 791992.51.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '791992.51'}}\n```",
