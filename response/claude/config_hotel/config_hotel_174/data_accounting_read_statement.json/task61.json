The costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services to customers\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets\n\nStep 1: For the first value, I need to look for selling expenses, as these are typically the costs related to securing customer orders and delivering goods. In the income statement, I can see:\n- \"Selling Expenses | 9828.84 | 2024-02-03\"\n\nStep 2: For the second value, I need to look for cash payments for property, plant and equipment in the cash flow statement. I can see:\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets | 2496137.92 | 2024-02-03\"\n\nThis represents the cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\nTherefore, the two values I need are:\n1. Selling Expenses: 9828.84\n2. Purchase of Fixed Assets: 2496137.92\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '9828.84', 'value2': '2496137.92'} }\n```",
