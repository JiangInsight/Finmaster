Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period\n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole\n\nLet me analyze the income statement:\n\n1. Total income is represented by \"Total Revenue\" which has a value of 791992.51\n2. The carrying amount of inventories sold is represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\" which has a value of 504930.00\n3. The costs of general management and administration is represented by \"Administrative Expenses\" which has a value of 10432.67\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '791992.51', 'value2': '504930.00', 'value3': '10432.67'}}\n```",
