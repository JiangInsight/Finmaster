Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense - This would be the \"Profit Before Tax\" from the Income Statement\n2. Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods/services received on credit - This would be the \"Accounts Payable\" from the Balance Sheet\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares - This would be the \"Paid-in Capital\" from the Balance Sheet\n\nLet me extract the end values for each item:\n\n1. From the Income Statement: \"Profit Before Tax\" = 151331.49\n2. From the Balance Sheet: \"Accounts Payable\" end amount = 3350120.00\n3. From the Balance Sheet: \"Paid-in Capital\" end amount = 16000000.00\n\nTherefore, the three values I need to extract are:\n- value1: 16000000.00 (Paid-in Capital)\n- value2: 151331.49 (Profit Before Tax)\n- value3: 3350120.00 (Accounts Payable)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16000000.00', 'value2': '151331.49', 'value3': '3350120.00'}}\n```",
