This is exactly what I'm looking for.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial amount of Interest Receivable: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- End amount of Interest Receivable: 5264.70 (as of 2024-02-03)\n\nI can also confirm this by looking at the cash flow statement, which shows \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" of -5264.70, indicating an increase in Interest Receivable.\n\nAdditionally, the income statement shows \"Interest Income\" of 5264.70, which matches the Interest Receivable amount, confirming that this is interest that has been recognized as income but not yet received in cash.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '5264.70'}}\n```",
