The negative sign indicates an increase in inventory (which is a use of cash). However, the task is asking for the reduction in inventory, which would be the opposite of this value.\n\nSince the inventory increased by 7,869,940.00, there was no reduction in inventory during this period. However, the task specifically asks for the value of reduction, which in this case is the negative value shown on the statement.\n\nTherefore, the reduction in inventory (assets held for sale) is -7869940.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-7869940.00'}}\n```",
