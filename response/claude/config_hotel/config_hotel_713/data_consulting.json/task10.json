It's calculated as:\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the provided financial statements:\n\n1. Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$2,868,695.86 (from the cash flow statement)\n2. Total Current Liabilities = $5,042,389.63 (from the balance sheet end amount)\n\nNow I'll calculate the ratio:\n-$2,868,695.86 / $5,042,389.63 = -0.5689 or approximately -0.57\n\nThis means that for every dollar of current liabilities, the company is generating negative $0.57 in operating cash flow, which indicates the company is not generating enough cash from operations to cover its current liabilities.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.57'} }\n```",
