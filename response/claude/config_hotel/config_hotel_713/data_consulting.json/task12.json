The formula for ROE is:\n\nROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity\n\nStep 1: Identify the Net Income from the income statement.\n- Net Income = $56,497.85\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Average Shareholders' Equity\n- Beginning Shareholders' Equity (2023-12-31) = $16,000,000.00\n- Ending Shareholders' Equity (2024-02-05) = $16,056,497.85\n- Average Shareholders' Equity = ($16,000,000.00 + $16,056,497.85) / 2 = $16,028,248.93\n\nStep 3: Calculate ROE\n- ROE = $56,497.85 / $16,028,248.93 = 0.00352 or 0.352%\n\nTherefore, the Return on Equity (ROE) for this period is 0.35%.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.35%'} }\n```",
