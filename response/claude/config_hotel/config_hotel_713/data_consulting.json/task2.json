The Quick Ratio is a measure of a company's short-term liquidity and is calculated by dividing quick assets (current assets minus inventory) by current liabilities.\n\nStep 1: Identify the quick assets (current assets minus inventory) at the end of the reporting period.\n- Total Current Assets: $13,190,375.83\n- Inventory: $7,848,830.00\n- Quick Assets = $13,190,375.83 - $7,848,830.00 = $5,341,545.83\n\nStep 2: Identify the current liabilities at the end of the reporting period.\n- Total Current Liabilities: $5,042,389.63\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Quick Ratio.\n- Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities\n- Quick Ratio = $5,341,545.83 / $5,042,389.63\n- Quick Ratio = 1.0593\n\nStep 4: Round to 2 decimal places.\n- Quick Ratio = 1.06\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '1.06'}}\n```",
