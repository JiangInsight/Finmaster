                        "content": "I'll calculate each of the requested financial ratios step by step.\n\n## 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio indicates how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\n- Formula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n- Net Credit Sales = Main Business Revenue = $547,392.30\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2 = ($0 + $200,359.99) / 2 = $100,180.00\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $547,392.30 / $100,180.00 = 5.46\n\n## 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay off short-term liabilities with its operating cash flow.\n- Formula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n- Operating Cash Flow = -$2,868,695.86\n- Current Liabilities = $5,042,389.63\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -$2,868,695.86 / $5,042,389.63 = -0.57\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio calculated above = -0.57\n\n## 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate revenue.\n- Formula: Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n- Net Sales = $547,392.30\n- Average Total Assets = (Beginning Assets + Ending Assets) / 2 = ($16,000,000 + $21,098,887.48) / 2 = $18,549,443.74\n- Total Asset Turnover Ratio = $547,392.30 / $18,549,443.74 = 0.03\n\n## 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio shows the proportion of equity and debt used to finance a company's assets.\n- Formula: Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n- Total Liabilities = $5,042,389.63\n- Total Shareholders' Equity = $16,056,497.85\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = $5,042,389.63 / $16,056,497.85 = 0.31\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"5.46\", \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-0.57\", \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.57\", \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.03\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.31\"}}\n```",
