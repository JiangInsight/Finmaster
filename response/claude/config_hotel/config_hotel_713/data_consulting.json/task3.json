This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt.\n\nThe formula for Debt to Asset Ratio is:\nTotal Liabilities รท Total Assets\n\nStep 1: Identify the Total Liabilities from the balance sheet.\nFrom the data, I can see that Total Current Liabilities at the end date is $5,042,389.63.\nThere are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so the Total Liabilities is $5,042,389.63.\n\nStep 2: Identify the Total Assets from the balance sheet.\nThe Total Assets at the end date is $21,098,887.48.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio.\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities รท Total Assets\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $5,042,389.63 รท $21,098,887.48\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 0.239 (rounded to 3 decimal places)\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 0.24 (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\nTherefore, the Debt to Asset Ratio is 0.24.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.24'}}\n```",
