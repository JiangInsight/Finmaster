Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities (from cash flow statement): -2,868,695.86\n2. Total Current Liabilities (from balance sheet): 5,042,389.63\n\nThe Operating Cash Flow Ratio is calculated by:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nCalculation:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -2,868,695.86 / 5,042,389.63 = -0.5689\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: -0.57\n\nThis negative ratio indicates that the company is not generating enough cash from its operations to cover its current liabilities.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.57'} }\n```",
