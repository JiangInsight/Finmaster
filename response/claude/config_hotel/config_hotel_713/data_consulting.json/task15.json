It's calculated as:\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Current Assets\n\nStep 1: Find the Total Revenue from the income statement.\nTotal Revenue = $547,392.30\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Average Current Assets.\nBeginning Current Assets (Initial amount) = $8,000,000.00\nEnding Current Assets (End amount) = $13,190,375.83\nAverage Current Assets = ($8,000,000.00 + $13,190,375.83) / 2 = $10,595,187.92\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Current Assets Turnover Ratio.\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = $547,392.30 / $10,595,187.92 = 0.0517\n\nStep 4: Round to two decimal places.\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = 0.05\n\nTherefore, the Current Assets Turnover Ratio is 0.05, which means the company generated $0.05 in revenue for every $1 invested in current assets during this period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.05'} }\n```",
