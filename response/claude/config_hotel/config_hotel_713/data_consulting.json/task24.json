Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nLet me calculate each ratio step by step.\n\n### Debt to Asset Ratio\nThe formula for Debt to Asset Ratio is: Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = $5,042,389.63 (Total Current Liabilities)\n- Total Assets = $21,098,887.48\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $5,042,389.63 / $21,098,887.48 = 0.239 ≈ 0.24\n\n### Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\nThe formula for Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit\n\nFrom the cash flow statement and income statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$2,868,695.86\n- Net Profit = $56,497.85\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = -$2,868,695.86 / $56,497.85 = -50.78 ≈ -50.78\n\nThe negative ratio indicates that while the company is profitable (positive net income), it's consuming cash in its operations rather than generating it.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.24', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-50.78'} }\n```",
