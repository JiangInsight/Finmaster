                        "content": "I'll solve this task by calculating the three financial ratios step by step.\n\n## 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio shows the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt.\n\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = $5,042,389.63 (Total Current Liabilities)\n- Total Assets = $21,098,887.48\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $5,042,389.63 / $21,098,887.48 = 0.2390 ≈ 0.24\n\n## 2. Gross Profit Margin\nThe Gross Profit Margin shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold.\n\nFormula: (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = $194,172.30\n- Total Revenue = $547,392.30\n\nGross Profit Margin = ($194,172.30 / $547,392.30) × 100% = 35.47%\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThe Operating Cash Flow Ratio measures a company's ability to cover current liabilities with cash generated from operations.\n\nFormula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the statements:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$2,868,695.86\n- Total Current Liabilities = $5,042,389.63\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$2,868,695.86 / $5,042,389.63 = -0.5689 ≈ -0.57\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.24', 'Gross Profit Margin': '35.47%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.57'} }\n```",
