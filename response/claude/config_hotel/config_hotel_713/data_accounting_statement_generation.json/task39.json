+ 385.56135 + 385.56135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + \n        262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + \n        262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + \n        262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + \n        262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + 262.74135 + \n        262.74135\n```\n\nCalculating this sum:\n- First 3 entries: 440.10945 + 385.56135 + 385.56135 = 1,211.23215\n- Remaining 33 entries: 33 Ã— 262.74135 = 8,670.46455\n\nTotal interest receivable accumulated: 1,211.23215 + 8,670.46455 = 9,881.6967\n\nFor the cash flow statement, an increase in interest receivable represents accrued interest that hasn't been received in cash yet. This is shown as a negative adjustment (subtraction) in the operating section of the cash flow statement.\n\nTherefore, the \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" will be negative, since we have an increase:\n-9,881.70 (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\nLet me review this calculation again:\n- All these interest receivable entries show a consistent buildup of interest that is recognized as income (accrual basis) but hasn't been received as cash\n- None of the entries show any payment received, as they all have \"Unpaid\" status\n- Therefore, this represents an increase in the interest receivable account\n\nSince this is an increase in a receivable, it represents a use of cash (or more precisely, income that has been recognized but not received in cash), so we need a negative adjustment in the cash flow statement.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-9881.70'} }\n```\n\nLet me verify this once more. Actually, I should be more precise. The increase in interest receivable exactly matches the sum, which is 9,881.6967. Rounding to 2 decimal places:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-9881.70'} }\n```",
