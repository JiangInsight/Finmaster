Let me work through this step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze Net Profit\nFirst, I need to calculate the net profit by analyzing revenue (sales) against expenses:\n\nTotal sales: Looking at all \"Sale\" transactions from Jan 1 to Feb 5, 2024.\nTotal expenses: Sum of all expenses (Administrative, Sales, Financial), Depreciation, and Cost of Goods Sold.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Depreciation\nDepreciation appears on:\n- Jan 1, 2024: 45,746.47\n- Feb 1, 2024: 45,741.88\nTotal: 91,488.35\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Changes in Working Capital\n- Accounts Receivable: All sales with \"Account Receviable\" as receive_method\n- Interest Receivable: All interest receivables transactions\n- Inventory: Sum of all purchases\n- Accounts Payable: All purchases with \"Account Payable\" as payment method\n- Tax Payable: Sum of all tax amounts from sales\n\n## Step 4: Determine Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n- Fixed Assets purchases: The initial fixed assets deposit of 8,000,000.00\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Cash and Cash Equivalents\n- Beginning Balance: Initial Cash (3,000,000.00) + Initial Bank deposit (5,000,000.00) = 8,000,000.00\n- Ending Balance: This will be determined by calculating the net effect of all cash transactions\n\n## Step 6: Calculate Net Cash Flow\nLet me add up all the components to determine the net cash flow.\n\nBased on my calculations from the transaction data:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow From Operating Activities': '0.00', 'Net Profit': '-94,656.85', 'Depreciation': '91,488.35', '(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-190,177.25', '(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-9,726.43', '(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-6,630,750.00', 'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '4,616,750.00', 'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '19,427.30', 'Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities': '-2,197,644.88', 'Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '0.00', 'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '8,000,000.00', 'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-8,000,000.00', 'Cash and Cash Equivalents': '0.00', 'Beginning Balance': '8,000,000.00', 'Ending Balance': '5,802,355.12', 'Net Increase': '-2,197,644.88'} }\n```",
