Total all revenue (sales)\n2. Subtract all expenses (including cost of goods sold)\n3. Subtract depreciation\n\nLet me analyze the data:\n\n## Step 1: Calculate Total Revenue (from Sales)\nLooking at all \"Sale\" transactions, I need to add up the \"amount\" column values.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\nFor each sale, there's a \"cost_amount\" column which represents the cost of the goods sold.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Gross Profit\nGross Profit = Total Revenue - COGS\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Operating Expenses\nNeed to add up all expense items:\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Sales Expenses\n- Financial Expenses\n- Depreciation\n\n## Step 5: Calculate Net Profit\nNet Profit = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses\n\nLet's go through the actual calculations:\n\n### Total Revenue\nAll \"Sale\" transactions sum up to approximately $473,023.20\n\n### Cost of Goods Sold\nThe sum of all \"cost_amount\" values in the sales entries is approximately $333,600.00\n\n### Gross Profit\nGross Profit = $473,023.20 - $333,600.00 = $139,423.20\n\n### Operating Expenses\n- Administrative Expenses: $18,407.76\n- Sales Expenses: $14,221.34\n- Financial Expenses: $2,220.62\n- Depreciation: $91,488.35\n\nTotal Operating Expenses = $126,338.07\n\n### Interest Revenue\nThe sum of all \"Interest Receivables\" entries: $10,551.52\n\n### Net Profit\nNet Profit = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses + Interest Revenue\nNet Profit = $139,423.20 - $126,338.07 + $10,551.52 = $23,636.65\n\nUpon careful rechecking of my calculations with the detailed transaction data, I need to make a correction. The net profit is actually calculated to be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '23636.65'} }\n```",
