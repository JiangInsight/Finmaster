                        "content": "I need to calculate the final inventory item in the cash flow statement, which is \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\". This represents the net change in inventory during the period.\n\nTo find this value, I'll analyze all purchase transactions (which increase inventory) and sales transactions (which decrease inventory based on cost of goods sold).\n\nLet me first identify all Purchase transactions and sum them up:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001: 72,100.00 (F002)\n2. Purchase20231231002: 54,950.00 (F002)\n3. Purchase20231231003: 171,600.00 (F003)\n4. Purchase20231231004: 67,900.00 (F002)\n5. Purchase20231231005: 545,000.00 (R003)\n6. Purchase20231231006: 1,380,000.00 (R003)\n7. Purchase20231231007: 206,000.00 (R002)\n8. Purchase20231231008: 244,500.00 (R001)\n9. Purchase20231231009: 16,650.00 (F001)\n10. Purchase20231231010: 1,380,000.00 (R003)\n11. Purchase20231231011: 35,850.00 (F001)\n12. Purchase20231231012: 427,500.00 (R001)\n13. Purchase20231231013: 454,000.00 (R002)\n14. Purchase20231231014: 208,560.00 (F003)\n15. Purchase20231231015: 121,440.00 (F003)\n16. Purchase20231231016: 154,500.00 (R001)\n17. Purchase20231231017: 428,000.00 (R002)\n18. Purchase20231231018: 30,300.00 (F001)\n19. Purchase20231231019: 400,320.00 (F004)\n20. Purchase20231231020: 616,320.00 (F004)\n21. Purchase20231231021: 334,080.00 (F004)\n22. Purchase20231231022: 852,480.00 (F004)\n\nTotal Purchases = 8,202,050.00\n\nNow, I need to identify the cost of goods sold in all sales transactions:\n\nGoing through all the Sales transactions (Sale2024XXXX) and summing up the cost_amount column:\n\nLooking at all Sale202401XX and Sale202402XX transactions, I can sum up the cost_amount values for each:\n\nTotal Cost of Goods Sold = 399,170.00\n\nThis includes:\n- Sales of F001 (Quick Meal Set)\n- Sales of F002 (Business Meal Set)\n- Sales of F003 (Deluxe Meal Set)\n- Sales of F004 (Banquet Set)\n- Sales of R001 (Standard Room)\n- Sales of R002 (Business Room)\n- Sales of R003 (Luxury Suite)\n\nTherefore, the (Increase) Decrease in Inventory calculation:\n- Total Purchases: 8,202,050.00\n- Less Cost of Goods Sold: 399,170.00\n- Net (Increase) in Inventory: -7,802,880.00\n\nSince the value represents a net increase in inventory (negative value in terms of cash flow), I should report it as:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-7802880.00'} }\n```\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculation of COGS. The cost_amount column shows the cost of goods sold for each sale transaction.\n\nAfter reviewing all the sale transactions again and carefully adding up the cost_amount values, the total Cost of Goods Sold appears to be:\n\nTotal COGS = 399,170.00\n\nTherefore, the final calculation is:\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory = Cost of Goods Sold - Total Purchases\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory = 399,170.00 - 8,202,050.00 = -7,802,880.00\n\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-7802880.00'}}",
