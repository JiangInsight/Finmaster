                        "content": "I need to calculate the bank deposits item in the balance sheet - both the initial value and the final value.\n\nFirst, let me identify the initial bank deposit value from the transactions:\n\n```\n| Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0 |\n```\n\nThe initial bank deposit value is 5,000,000.0.\n\nNow, to calculate the final value, I need to track all transactions that affect the bank account:\n1. Initial deposit\n2. Bank transfers (both incoming and outgoing)\n3. Payments or receipts made via bank\n\nLet me identify all transactions that affect the bank account:\n\n1. Initial bank deposit: +5,000,000.0\n2. Bank transfer purchases:\n   - Purchase20231231002: -54,950.0 (Bank Transfer)\n   - Purchase20231231004: -67,900.0 (Bank Transfer)\n   - Purchase20231231005: -545,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n   - Purchase20231231010: -1,380,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n   - Purchase20231231011: -1,450,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n   - Purchase20231231009: -130,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n   - Purchase20231231010: -240,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n   - Purchase20231231021: -334,080.0 (Bank Transfer)\n\n3. Sales with bank receipts: None shown explicitly as bank deposits\n\nI'll calculate the final bank deposit value by starting with the initial value and adding/subtracting all bank-related transactions.\n\nInitial bank deposit: +5,000,000.0\nBank transfers for purchases: -54,950.0 - 67,900.0 - 545,000.0 - 1,380,000.0 - 1,450,000.0 - 130,000.0 - 240,000.0 - 334,080.0\n\nFinal bank deposit value = 5,000,000.0 - 4,201,930.0 = 798,070.0\n\nHowever, I need to double-check these calculations as some purchase IDs appear more than once. Let me ensure I'm counting each transaction only once:\n\nLooking at the unique purchase IDs:\n- Purchase20231231002: -54,950.0\n- Purchase20231231004: -67,900.0\n- Purchase20231231005: -545,000.0\n- Purchase20231231009: -130,000.0\n- Purchase20231231010: -1,380,000.0\n- Purchase20231231011: -1,450,000.0 (this was actually not a bank transfer but Unpaid Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231021: -334,080.0\n\nLet me recalculate:\nInitial bank deposit: +5,000,000.0\nBank transfers for purchases: -54,950.0 - 67,900.0 - 545,000.0 - 1,380,000.0 - 130,000.0 - 334,080.0 = -2,511,930.0\n\nFinal bank deposit value = 5,000,000.0 - 2,511,930.0 = 2,488,070.0\n\nWait, I need to verify my approach and check the data again. Let me identify all transactions in the data that specifically mention \"Bank Transfer\" in the payment_method column:\n\n- Purchase20231231002: -54,950.0 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231004: -67,900.0 (Bank Transfer) \n- Purchase20231231005: -545,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231010: -1,380,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231009: -130,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n\nThe total outflow from bank transfers is: 2,177,850.0\n\nThe final bank deposit value would be: 5,000,000.0 - 2,177,850.0 = 2,822,150.0\n\nThis calculation seems more accurate based on explicit bank transfers, but I want to ensure I haven't missed anything.\n\nActually, I should be more systematic. Let me identify all transactions that affect the bank balance:\n\n1. Initial bank deposit: +5,000,000.0\n2. All transactions with payment_method = \"Bank Transfer\":\n   - Purchase20231231002: -54,950.0\n   - Purchase20231231004: -67,900.0\n   - Purchase20231231005: -545,000.0\n   - Purchase20231231010: -1,380,000.0\n   - Purchase20231231009: -130,000.0\n\nTotal impact of bank transfers: -2,177,850.0\n\nStarting balance: 5,000,000.0\nEnding balance: 5,000,000.0 - 2,177,850.0 = 2,822,150.0\n\nTherefore:\n- Bank Deposits Initial Value: 5,000,000.00\n- Bank Deposits End Value: 2,822,150.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Bank Deposits Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Bank Deposits End Value': '2822150.00'} }\n```",
