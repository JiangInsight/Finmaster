                        "content": "I need to calculate the property, plant and non-current assets for the balance sheet, showing both initial and final amounts.\n\nLet me analyze the data step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll identify the initial value of non-current assets from the data.\n2. Then I'll track any additions to fixed assets during the period.\n3. Finally, I'll account for depreciation to determine the ending value.\n\n## Step 1: Identify Initial Value\nLooking at the data, I can see:\n```\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 8000000.0 | 8000000.0 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n```\n\nThis indicates that the initial value of fixed assets is 8,000,000.00.\n\n## Step 2: Track Depreciation\nI can see there are two depreciation entries:\n```\n| Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45746.47 | 45746.47 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Depreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | 2024-02-01 | 2024-02-01 | 45741.88 | 45741.88 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n```\n\nTotal depreciation = 45,746.47 + 45,741.88 = 91,488.35\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Ending Value\nI need to check if there were any fixed asset purchases during the period, but I don't see any entries with types like \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar. The transactions are primarily related to sales, purchases of inventory, and expenses.\n\nSince there were no additions to fixed assets during the period, the ending value will be:\nInitial value - Total depreciation = 8,000,000.00 - 91,488.35 = 7,908,511.65\n\n## Conclusion\nBased on the data provided:\n- Initial value of non-current assets: 8,000,000.00\n- Final value of non-current assets: 7,908,511.65\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '7908511.65'}}\n```",
