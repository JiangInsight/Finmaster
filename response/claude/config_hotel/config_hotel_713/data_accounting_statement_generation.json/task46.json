Based on the data, I need to look for the initial deposits recorded at the start of the period.\n\nLooking at the transaction data, I can see the initial entries:\n\n```\n| Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 3000000.0 | 3000000.0 |\n| Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0 |\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 8000000.0 | 8000000.0 |\n```\n\nFor the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents typically include:\n1. Cash in hand (cash deposit)\n2. Bank accounts (bank deposit)\n\nFixed assets are not considered cash or cash equivalents, so they should not be included in the beginning balance calculation.\n\nTherefore, the beginning cash and cash equivalents balance would be:\nCash deposit + Bank deposit = 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 8,000,000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
