These could include:\n- Purchases of fixed assets\n- Disposals of fixed assets\n- Depreciation of fixed assets\n\nLooking through the data, I don't see any specific fixed asset purchases that are explicitly marked as such (unlike in the example where there was a \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" transaction).\n\nHowever, I do see two depreciation entries:\n```\nDepreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45746.47 | 45746.47\nDepreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | 2024-02-01 | 2024-02-01 | 45741.88 | 45741.88\n```\n\nThese depreciation entries would reduce the value of the fixed assets.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the Final Fixed Assets Value\nInitial Fixed Assets Value: 8,000,000.00\nLess: Depreciation (January 2024): 45,746.47\nLess: Depreciation (February 2024): 45,741.88\nFinal Fixed Assets Value: 8,000,000.00 - 45,746.47 - 45,741.88 = 7,908,511.65\n\nTherefore, the initial value of fixed assets was 8,000,000.00 and the final value after accounting for depreciation is 7,908,511.65.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Fixed Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Fixed Assets End Value': '7908511.65'} }\n```",
