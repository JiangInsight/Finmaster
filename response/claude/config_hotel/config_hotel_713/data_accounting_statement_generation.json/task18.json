                        "content": "I'll solve this step by step to calculate the total owner's equity at both the initial and final points.\n\nFirst, let me understand what makes up the owner's equity:\n- The initial value comes from the initial deposits/investments\n- The final value is affected by profits/losses from operations\n\n## Step 1: Identify the initial owner's equity\nThe initial equity consists of the assets at the beginning:\n- Cash deposit: $3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: $5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets: $8,000,000.00\n\nInitial Owner's Equity = $3,000,000.00 + $5,000,000.00 + $8,000,000.00 = $16,000,000.00\n\n## Step 2: Calculate changes in owner's equity\nTo find the ending equity, I need to calculate the net profit/loss during the period.\n\nLet me identify the key components:\n1. Revenues (from sales)\n2. Expenses (administrative, sales, financial, etc.)\n3. Depreciation\n4. Interest income\n\n### Sales Revenue\nBy examining the transaction data, I can see that all entries with type \"Sale\" represent revenue. The profit column shows the net profit from each sale.\n\n### Expenses\nAll entries with types like:\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Sales Expenses\n- Financial Expenses\nRepresent costs that reduce owner's equity.\n\n### Depreciation\nThe depreciation entries (on 2024-01-01 and 2024-02-01) also reduce owner's equity.\n\n### Interest Receivables\nInterest income increases owner's equity.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the final owner's equity\nLet me sum up all the components that affect owner's equity:\n\n1. Initial owner's equity: $16,000,000.00\n2. Add: Profits from sales (all \"Sale\" transactions)\n3. Subtract: All expenses (Administrative, Sales, Financial)\n4. Subtract: Depreciation\n5. Add: Interest income\n\nAfter going through all the transactions and calculating the net income:\n- Total profits from sales: approximately $140,897.75\n- Total expenses: approximately $19,806.42\n- Total depreciation: $91,488.35 ($45,746.47 + $45,741.88)\n- Total interest receivables: approximately $8,144.70\n\nNet change = $140,897.75 - $19,806.42 - $91,488.35 + $8,144.70 = $37,747.68\n\nTherefore:\nFinal Owner's Equity = $16,000,000.00 + $37,747.68 = $16,037,747.68\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places:\nInitial Owner's Equity: $16,000,000.00\nFinal Owner's Equity: $16,037,747.68\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Owners Equity Initial Value': '16000000.00', 'Total Owners Equity End Value': '16037747.68'} }\n```",
