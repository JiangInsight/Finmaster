In accounting, this typically includes \"Cash on Hand\" and sometimes \"Bank Deposits\" depending on how readily accessible they are.\n\nFrom the balance sheet, I can see:\n1. \"Cash on Hand\": Initial amount = 3,000,000.00 (2023-12-31), End amount = 2,179,154.14 (2024-02-05)\n2. \"Bank Deposits\": Initial amount = 5,000,000.00 (2023-12-31), End amount = 2,952,150.00 (2024-02-05)\n\nSince both \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" represent liquid cash that can be used for day-to-day operations, I need to add these values together:\n\nInitial value = 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 8,000,000.00\nEnd value = 2,179,154.14 + 2,952,150.00 = 5,131,304.14\n\nActually, I notice that in the example solution, only \"Cash on Hand\" was considered as the cash available for day-to-day operations, not the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\". Following this same approach for the problem to solve:\n\nInitial value = 3,000,000.00\nEnd value = 2,179,154.14\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '3000000.00', 'end value': '2179154.14'}}\n```",
