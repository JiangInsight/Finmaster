The negative sign in \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" indicates that this is an outflow, but since the amount is $0.00, there was effectively no cash flow from investing activities.\n\nThe final value of \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is -$0.00, and the sub-item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is $0.00 (without the negative sign since we're listing the raw expense amount).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '0.00'}}}\n```",
