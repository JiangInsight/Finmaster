Taxes accrued but not yet paid (from Balance Sheet)\n3. Total income arising from ordinary activities (from Income Statement)\n\nLet me review each financial statement carefully:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- Taxes Payable: 27369.63 (This represents taxes accrued but not yet paid)\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- Total Revenue: 547392.30 (This represents total income from ordinary activities)\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -2868695.86 (This is the net amount of cash from principal revenue-producing activities)\n\nTherefore, the three values I need to extract are:\n1. Taxes Payable (value1): 27369.63\n2. Total Revenue (value2): 547392.30\n3. Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities (value3): -2868695.86\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '27369.63', 'value2': '547392.30', 'value3': '-2868695.86'}}\n```",
