These are typically classified as current assets.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet provided:\n\n1. Current assets are assets that are expected to be realized or consumed within the normal operating cycle.\n2. The line item that represents this is \"Total Current Assets\"\n3. The initial value of Total Current Assets as of 2023-12-31 is 8000000.00\n4. The end value of Total Current Assets as of 2024-02-05 is 13190375.83\n\nThese current assets include:\n- Cash on Hand\n- Bank Deposits\n- Interest Receivable\n- Accounts Receivable\n- Inventory\n\nTherefore, the total assets expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal operating cycle are represented by the \"Total Current Assets\" line item.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '13190375.83'}}\n```",
