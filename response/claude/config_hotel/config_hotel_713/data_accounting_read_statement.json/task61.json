Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\nFor the first value, I need to find the selling expenses, which typically represent costs to secure customer orders and deliver goods. Looking at the income statement, I can see:\n- \"Selling Expenses\" with a value of 14714.68\n\nFor the second value, I need to find cash payments for property, plant and equipment. Looking at the cash flow statement, I can see:\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of 0.00\n\nTherefore, the two values I need to extract are 14714.68 and 0.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '14714.68', 'value2': '0.00'} }\n```",
