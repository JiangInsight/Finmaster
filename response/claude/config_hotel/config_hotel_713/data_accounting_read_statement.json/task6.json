These represent the long-term tangible assets that a company uses in its operations.\n\nLooking at the provided balance sheet, I can see the \"Fixed Assets\" line item, which fits this description. The values are:\n- Initial amount (2023-12-31): 8000000.00\n- End amount (2024-02-05): 8000000.00\n\nNote that there is also \"Accumulated Depreciation\" which represents the cumulative depreciation charged against these fixed assets. However, the task asks for the value of the tangible items themselves, which would be the gross fixed assets before depreciation.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
