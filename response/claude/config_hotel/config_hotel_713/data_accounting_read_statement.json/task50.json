Reduction in inventory\n3. Net cash flow from investing activities\n4. Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n\nLet me examine the cash flow statement carefully:\n\n1. Depreciation value: This is listed as \"Depreciation\" with a value of 91488.35\n\n2. Reduction in inventory: The line \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" shows -7848830.00, which represents an increase in inventory (negative value means more inventory was added)\n\n3. Net cash flow from investing activities: Listed as \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with a value of -0.00\n\n4. Net change in cash and cash equivalents: Listed as \"Net Increase\" with a value of -2868695.86\n\nNow I'll put these values in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91488.35', 'value2': '-7848830.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '-2868695.86'}}\n```",
