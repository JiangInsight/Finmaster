This represents the change in tax accrued but not yet paid during the period.\n\nSince the value is positive (27,369.63), it indicates an increase in tax payable, which means more tax has accrued than was paid during this period.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item is \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" and the value is 27,369.63.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '27369.63'}}\n```",
