This is exactly what we're looking for.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThis shows that the beginning balance of cash and cash equivalents was 8,000,000.00.\n\nI can also verify this from the balance sheet, where the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" at the initial date (2023-12-31) equals:\n3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 8,000,000.00\n\nTherefore, the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period is 8,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
