This typically refers to inventory changes in a company's cash flow statement.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement, I can see a line item for \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with a value of \"-7848830.00\". \n\nThe negative sign indicates that this is an increase in inventory (rather than a decrease). When inventory increases, it means more cash is tied up in assets held for sale, which is shown as a negative cash flow item.\n\nSince the task asks for the value of reduction in the amount of assets held for sale, and what we have is actually an increase (not a reduction), the value is \"-7848830.00\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-7848830.00'}}\n```",
