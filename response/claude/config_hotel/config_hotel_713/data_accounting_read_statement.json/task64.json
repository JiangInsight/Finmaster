The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\n## Balance Sheet\n- For capital contributed by shareholders (Paid-in Capital): $16,000,000.00\n- For accounts payable (amount owed for goods/services): $5,015,020.00\n\n## Income Statement\n- For profit before tax: $83,867.48\n\n## Cash Flow Statement\n- This confirms the accounts payable increase of $5,015,020.00\n\nLooking at all three statements, I can identify the three values:\n1. Profit before tax (from Income Statement): $83,867.48\n2. Accounts Payable (from Balance Sheet): $5,015,020.00\n3. Paid-in Capital (from Balance Sheet): $16,000,000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16000000.00', 'value2': '83867.48', 'value3': '5015020.00'}}\n```",
