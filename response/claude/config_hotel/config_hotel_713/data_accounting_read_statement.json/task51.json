First, I'll check the balance sheet for any accounts related to interest accrued but not received.\n   - I can see a line item called \"Interest Receivable\" with initial amount of 0.00 on 2023-12-31 and end amount of 9881.70 on 2024-02-05.\n\n2. To confirm this is indeed interest accrued but not yet received, I'll cross-check with other statements:\n   - In the cash flow statement, there's a line \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" showing -9881.70, which confirms this is an accrual.\n   - In the income statement, there's \"Interest Income\" of 9881.70, which matches the Interest Receivable amount.\n\n3. The Interest Receivable account represents interest that has been earned but not yet received in cash, which is exactly what we're looking for.\n\nTherefore, the amounts of interest accrued but not yet received are:\n- Initial value: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- End value: 9881.70 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '9881.70'} }\n```",
