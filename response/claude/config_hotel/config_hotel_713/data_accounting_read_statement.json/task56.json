In the balance sheet, I see \"Accumulated Depreciation\" with an End_amount of 91,488.35 as of 2024-02-05.\n\n2. In the cash flow statement, I find \"Depreciation\" listed with an Amount of 91,488.35.\n\n3. In the income statement, I also see \"Depreciation\" listed as an expense with an Amount of 91,488.35.\n\nAll three statements consistently show the same value for depreciation. This represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of assets over their useful lives during the reporting period.\n\nTherefore, the value I need to extract is 91,488.35.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91488.35'} }\n```",
