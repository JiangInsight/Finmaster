When Accounts Receivable increases, it means more money is owed to the company (which is a use of cash). When Accounts Receivable decreases, it means the company is collecting on those receivables (which is a source of cash).\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement, I can see the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with a value of \"-200359.99\". \n\nThe negative sign here indicates an increase in accounts receivable (more money owed to the entity), rather than a decrease. This matches the standard presentation format where increases in receivables are shown as negative values on the cash flow statement because they represent cash outflows.\n\nTherefore, the value I need to extract is \"-200359.99\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-200359.99'}}\n```",
