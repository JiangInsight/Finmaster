This isn't necessarily an inconsistency but worth noting.\n\nContinuing through the records, I need to pay special attention to:\n1. Calculation errors (price × quantity ≠ amount)\n2. Invoice descriptions that don't match the recorded data\n3. Mismatched transaction types\n\nI've found a significant inconsistency in Sale20240202106:\n- The recorded_type is \"Depreciation\" but the invoice clearly describes a Sale transaction\n- The invoice states \"On February 02, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $2997.25, totaling $2997.25...\"\n- All the details match a typical sale transaction, including cost amount, tax amount, profit, etc.\n- This is clearly misclassified as \"Depreciation\" when it should be \"Sale\"\n\nThis is the only clear inconsistency I've identified in the dataset.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Depreciation', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240202106'} }\n```",
