Wrong transaction type (recorded as expense, should be sale)\n2. Incorrect total amount\n3. Incorrect unit price\n\n## Other transaction types\nReviewing other transaction types (Interest, Expense, Depreciation):\n- The Interest Receivables transactions appear consistent\n- Expense transactions match their invoice descriptions\n- Depreciation entries appear accurate\n\nTherefore, the main inconsistency identified is in transaction Sale20240127087.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '213.23', 'Recorded price': '203.03', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '1066.15', 'Recorded amount': '1256.91', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240127087'} }\n```",
