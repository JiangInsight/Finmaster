This is an inconsistency.\n\nAlso for this same transaction, the recorded_type is \"Financial Expenses\" but the invoice refers to it as a \"Sale\" with details about units, unit price, etc. This is another inconsistency.\n\nAnother issue to look at is the transaction \"Initial20231231001\" which appears three times with the same ID but different recorded_types and recorded_amounts. Looking at the Fixed Assets entry, it shows 8000000.0 while the other two entries show 3000000.0 and 5000000.0. This suggests the Fixed Assets value may have been intended to be the total of the other two, but it's recorded as a separate entry with the same ID.\n\nLooking through other transactions methodically:\n\nAll other date fields appear to match the invoice descriptions.\nThe transaction identifiers and descriptions match up.\nFor sale and purchase transactions, the calculated amounts from quantity Ã— price match the recorded amounts.\n\nThe most significant inconsistency is with Sale20240201102, which has both a date error and category error.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Financial Expenses\", \"Original date\": \"2024-02-01\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-03-02\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240201102\"}}\n```",
