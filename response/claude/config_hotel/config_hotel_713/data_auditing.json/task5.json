The invoice states: \"On January 09, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $2976.04, totaling $5952.08.\"\n2. But the recorded_amount shows $2976.04, which doesn't match what 2 units at $2976.04 each should total ($5952.08).\n3. The recorded_cost_amount is $4000.00 (which aligns with 2 units at $2000 each).\n4. The recorded_profit is $1952.08, which makes sense if total is $5952.08 minus cost of $4000.\n5. However, the recorded_quantity is only 1, not 2 as stated in the invoice.\n\nThis is clearly an inconsistency where the quantity was incorrectly recorded as 1 instead of 2.\n\nLet me check for other inconsistencies:\n\nFor transaction Initial20231231001 (Fixed Assets), there's a discrepancy between the recorded_amount ($8000000.0) and the invoice amount ($5000000.00), but this seems to be part of a set of three transactions with the same ID, so I'll be cautious about flagging this as an error.\n\nI don't see other clear inconsistencies between the recorded fields and the invoice descriptions. The Sale20240109032 transaction has the most obvious internal inconsistency.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"2.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"5952.08\", \"Recorded amount\": \"2976.04\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240109032\"}}\n```",
