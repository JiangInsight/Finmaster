The recorded_type is \"Sales Expenses\" but the invoice clearly states \"Sale\"\n2. The recorded_unit_price is 654.39 but the invoice states 554.42\n3. The unit price calculation (Total/Quantity = 554.42/1 = 554.42) confirms the invoice is correct\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"554.42\", \"Recorded price\": \"654.39\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240110039\"}}\n```",
