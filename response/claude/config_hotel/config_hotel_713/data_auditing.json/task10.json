The recorded amount is 8000000.0, but according to the invoice, it should be 5000000.00. This discrepancy could be due to an error in data entry.\n\n## Sale20240117064\nFor this transaction, let's verify the profit calculation:\n- Revenue: 706.59 (total)\n- Cost: 450.0\n- Expected profit: 706.59 - 450.0 = 256.59\n- Recorded profit: 281.51\n\nThere's a discrepancy in the profit calculation. The recorded profit (281.51) is higher than what it should be (256.59) based on the transaction details.\n\n## Fixed Assets Initial Deposit\nLet me verify if the amount in the Fixed Assets entry is consistent with what would be expected. The invoice indicates $5000000.00, but the recorded amount is $8000000.00. This appears to be an inconsistency worth noting.\n\nAfter reviewing all transactions, I found the following inconsistencies:\n\n1. Sale20240117064: The profit calculation is incorrect\n2. Initial20231231001 (Fixed Assets): The recorded amount doesn't match the invoice\n\nLet me format the response as requested:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '5000000.00', 'Recorded amount': '8000000.0', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': '256.59', 'Recorded profit': '281.51', 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240117064'} }",
