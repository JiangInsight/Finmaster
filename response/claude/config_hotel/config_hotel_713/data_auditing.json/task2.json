Date inconsistencies\n2. Amount calculation errors\n3. Quantity or price discrepancies\n4. Any other fields that don't match what's in the invoice description\n\nAfter examining all the transactions, I found two date inconsistencies:\n\n1. Sale20240121071: The recorded_date is \"2024-02-15\" but the invoice description states \"On January 21, 2024, an invoice was issued...\"\n\n2. Expense20240129001 (Administrative Expenses): The recorded_date is \"2024-02-14\" but the invoice description states \"On January 29, 2024, an invoice was issued...\"\n\nThese date inconsistencies are significant because the dates in the invoice descriptions (which are considered more reliable) don't match the recorded dates in the transaction entries.\n\nLet me address the most significant one:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-21', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-15', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240121071'} }\n```",
