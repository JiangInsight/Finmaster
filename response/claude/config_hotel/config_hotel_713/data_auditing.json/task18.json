The recorded_payment/receipt_status is \"Unpaid\", but the invoice states the transaction was \"paid\" - this is a contradiction.\n2. The recorded_quantity is 4.0, but the invoice mentions 5.0 units.\n3. The recorded_profit is $601.06, but based on the information in the invoice, it should be $778.60 (calculated from the sale of 5 units at $505.72 each, minus the cost of $1750.00).\n4. The recorded_amount of $2022.88 doesn't match what 4 units at $505.72 would cost ($2022.88), nor what 5 units would cost ($2528.60 as mentioned in the invoice).\n\nSince the invoice is considered more reliable, these are clear inconsistencies.\n\nLet me verify the math in the invoice to confirm:\n- 5 units at $505.72 = $2528.60 (total amount)\n- Tax amount of $126.43\n- Total after tax = $2402.17\n- Cost amount = $1750.00\n- Expected profit = $2528.60 - $1750.00 = $778.60\n\nThe recorded profit of $601.06 is indeed incorrect compared to what the invoice calculation shows.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"5.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"4.0\", \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"2528.60\", \"Recorded amount\": \"2022.88\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": \"778.60\", \"Recorded profit\": \"601.06\", \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240110038\"}}\n```",
