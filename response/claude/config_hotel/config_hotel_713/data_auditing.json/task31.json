The recorded quantity is 0, but the invoice mentions 1.0 units\n2. The recorded amount is $540.71, but the invoice states $463.40\n3. The recorded tax amount is $514.01, but the invoice mentions $23.17\n4. The recorded unit price is $452.5, but the invoice shows $463.40\n\nThis is a clear inconsistency where several fields don't match the invoice text, which is generally considered more reliable.\n\nLet me check if there are any other inconsistencies in the remaining transactions...\n\nI've finished reviewing all transactions and found only one entry with clear inconsistencies: Sale20240201103.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"0.0\", \"Original price\": \"463.40\", \"Recorded price\": \"452.50\", \"Original amount\": \"463.40\", \"Recorded amount\": \"540.71\", \"Original tax\": \"23.17\", \"Recorded tax\": \"514.01\", \"id\": \"Sale20240201103\"}}\n```",
