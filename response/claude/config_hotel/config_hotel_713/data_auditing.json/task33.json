The recorded_type is \"Depreciation\" but the invoice describes a \"Sale\"\n2. The recorded_date is \"2024-01-27\" but the invoice says \"January 05, 2024\"\n3. The recorded_amount is \"5201.39\" but the invoice indicates \"4599.18\"\n4. The recorded_unit_price is \"2671.9\" but the invoice states \"2299.59\"\n5. The recorded_tax_amount is \"3534.1\" but the invoice shows \"229.96\"\n\nThis transaction has multiple fields that don't match what's described in the invoice.\n\nBased on the invoice description: \"On January 05, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $2299.59, totaling $4599.18. The cost amount for this transaction was $3000.00, with a tax amount of $229.96, leading to a total amount due of $4369.22. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\nThe discrepancies are significant, with wrong transaction type, date, amount, unit price, and tax amount.\n\nAfter reviewing all the transactions in the dataset, this transaction appears to contain the most serious inconsistencies.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Depreciation\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-05\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-27\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"2.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"2.0\", \"Original price\": \"2299.59\", \"Recorded price\": \"2671.9\", \"Original receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original amount\": \"4599.18\", \"Recorded amount\": \"5201.39\", \"Original tax\": \"229.96\", \"Recorded tax\": \"3534.1\", \"Original profit\": \"1599.18\", \"Recorded profit\": \"1599.18\", \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240105019\"}}\n```",
