I need to sum up all these amounts to get the total interest income.\n\nLet me extract and add all the interest receivable transactions:\n\nJanuary 1: 445.00\nJanuary 2: 445.00\nJanuary 3: 404.49212704\nJanuary 4: 404.49212704\nJanuary 5: 348.48620704\nJanuary 6: 348.48620704\nJanuary 7: 348.48620704\nJanuary 8: 348.48620704\nJanuary 9: 279.87037098999997\nJanuary 10: 279.87037098999997\nJanuary 11: 279.87037098999997\nJanuary 12: 279.87037098999997\nJanuary 13: 146.75789479\nJanuary 14: 146.75789479\nJanuary 15: 146.75789479\nJanuary 16: 146.75789479\nJanuary 17: 146.75789479\nJanuary 18: 146.75789479\nJanuary 19: 146.75789479\nJanuary 20: 146.75789479\nJanuary 21: 146.75789479\nJanuary 22: 91.10276028000001\nJanuary 23: 91.10276028000001\nJanuary 24: 91.10276028000001\nJanuary 25: 91.10276028000001\nJanuary 26: 91.10276028000001\nJanuary 27: 91.10276028000001\nJanuary 28: 91.10276028000001\nJanuary 29: 91.10276028000001\nJanuary 30: 91.10276028000001\nJanuary 31: 91.10276028000001\nFebruary 1: 49.75595374000001\n\nWhen I add all these values:\n445.00 + 445.00 + 404.49212704 + 404.49212704 + 348.48620704 + 348.48620704 + 348.48620704 + 348.48620704 + 279.87037098999997 + 279.87037098999997 + 279.87037098999997 + 279.87037098999997 + 146.75789479 + 146.75789479 + 146.75789479 + 146.75789479 + 146.75789479 + 146.75789479 + 146.75789479 + 146.75789479 + 146.75789479 + 91.10276028000001 + 91.10276028000001 + 91.10276028000001 + 91.10276028000001 + 91.10276028000001 + 91.10276028000001 + 91.10276028000001 + 91.10276028000001 + 91.10276028000001 + 91.10276028000001 + 49.75595374000001 = 6,570.69\n\nThe sum of all interest receivable amounts is approximately 6,570.69.\n\nHowever, to be precise and ensure I haven't made any arithmetic errors in the manual calculation, let me calculate the sum more methodically:\n\nFrom Jan 1-8: 3,093.41\nFrom Jan 9-12: 1,119.48\nFrom Jan 13-21: 1,321.82\nFrom Jan 22-31: 911.03\nFeb 1: 49.76\n\nTotal: 6,495.50\n\nAfter double-checking, I notice some fluctuations in the interest amounts throughout the month. The correct total should be 6,495.50.\n\nFurther verifying against accounting standards, interest income should be reported in the income statement for the period it's earned, regardless of when it's received. So all these interest receivables entries represent interest income earned during this period.\n\nTherefore, the total interest income for the income statement is 6,495.50.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Interest Income': '6495.50'} }\n```",
