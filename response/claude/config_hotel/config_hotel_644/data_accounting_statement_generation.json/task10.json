                        "content": "I need to calculate the property, plant and non-current assets for the balance sheet, showing both initial and final values.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the initial non-current assets value\nLooking at the transactions, I can see there's an initial fixed assets entry:\n```\nInitial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 8000000.0 | 8000000.0\n```\nSo the initial value of non-current assets is 8,000,000.00.\n\n## Step 2: Identify transactions that affect non-current assets\nI need to find all fixed asset purchases and depreciation entries that affect the non-current assets balance.\n\n### Fixed asset purchases:\n1. `FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 455144.64 | Elevator System4`\n2. `FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 374964.45 | Kitchen Equipment5`\n3. `FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 1495645.8 | Renovation Project6`\n4. `FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 625338.59 | Elevator System7`\n5. `FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 464570.86 | Kitchen Equipment8`\n\nTotal fixed asset purchases: 455,144.64 + 374,964.45 + 1,495,645.8 + 625,338.59 + 464,570.86 = 3,415,664.34\n\n### Depreciation entries:\n1. `Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 45751.5`\n2. `Depreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | 86352.28`\n\nTotal depreciation: 45,751.5 + 86,352.28 = 132,103.78\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the ending non-current assets value\nStarting value + Additions - Depreciation = Ending value\n8,000,000.00 + 3,415,664.34 - 132,103.78 = 11,283,560.56\n\n## Step 4: Format the answer\nHowever, let me double-check this calculation. The fixed asset additions come to 3,415,664.34, and the depreciation is 132,103.78. The net change is 3,415,664.34 - 132,103.78 = 3,283,560.56.\n\nStarting with 8,000,000.00 and adding 3,283,560.56 gives us 11,283,560.56.\n\nBut something doesn't seem right here. Let me check if there are any other factors affecting non-current assets that I might have missed. However, based on the data provided, there are no disposals or other transactions directly affecting non-current assets.\n\nTherefore:\n- Initial non-current assets: 8,000,000.00\n- Final non-current assets: 11,283,560.56\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '11283560.56'} }\n```",
