Let me work through this step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Identify and calculate Main Business Revenue\nFirst, I need to identify all sales transactions and sum them up. These are all records with \"type\" containing \"Sale\".\n\nWhen I analyze the data, I can see that:\n- All sale transactions have types starting with \"Sale\"\n- The sales amount is in the \"amount\" column\n\nAdding up all sales transactions:\n- Total sales amount = 767,642.21\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\nFor the cost of goods sold:\n- Each sale record contains the \"cost_amount\" field\n- Summing up all cost_amount values for all sales = 499,750.00\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Gross Profit\nGross Profit = Main Business Revenue - COGS\nGross Profit = 767,642.21 - 499,750.00 = 267,892.21\n\n## Step 4: Identify and Calculate Expenses\n\n### 4.1 Administrative Expenses\nI'll sum all transactions with type \"Administrative Expenses\":\nAdministrative Expenses total = 12,642.27\n\n### 4.2 Selling Expenses\nI'll sum all transactions with type \"Sales Expenses\":\nSales Expenses total = 9,782.83\n\n### 4.3 Depreciation\nI'll sum all transactions with type \"Depreciation\":\nDepreciation = 45,751.50 + 86,352.28 = 132,103.78\n\n### 4.4 Financial Expenses\nI'll sum all transactions with type \"Financial Expenses\":\nFinancial Expenses total = 2,675.27\n\n### 4.5 Total Expenses\nTotal Expenses = Administrative Expenses + Selling Expenses + Depreciation + Financial Expenses\nTotal Expenses = 12,642.27 + 9,782.83 + 132,103.78 + 2,675.27 = 157,204.15\n\n## Step 5: Calculate Interest Income\nInterest Income comes from transactions with type \"Interest Receivables\":\nInterest Income total = 5,843.27\n\n## Step 6: Calculate Profit Before Tax\nProfit Before Tax = Gross Profit - Total Expenses + Interest Income\nProfit Before Tax = 267,892.21 - 157,204.15 + 5,843.27 = 116,531.33\n\n## Step 7: Calculate Tax Expense\nThe tax is included in the \"tax_amount\" column of the sales transactions.\nTax Expense total = 38,382.11\n\n## Step 8: Calculate Net Profit\nNet Profit = Profit Before Tax - Tax Expense\nNet Profit = 116,531.33 - 38,382.11 = 78,149.22\n\n## Complete Income Statement\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Main Business Revenue\": \"767642.21\", \"Total Revenue\": \"767642.21\", \"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"499750.00\", \"Total Cost\": \"499750.00\", \"Gross Profit\": \"267892.21\", \"Administrative Expenses\": \"12642.27\", \"Selling Expenses\": \"9782.83\", \"Depreciation\": \"132103.78\", \"Financial Expenses\": \"2675.27\", \"Total Expenses\": \"157204.15\", \"Interest Income\": \"5843.27\", \"Profit Before Tax\": \"116531.33\", \"Tax Expense\": \"38382.11\", \"Net Profit\": \"78149.22\"}}\n```",
