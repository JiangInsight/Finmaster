This would be the initial cash and bank deposits available at the start of the reporting period.\n\nLet me examine the data to identify the initial balances.\n\nLooking at the transactions data, I can see entries with the type \"Initial20231231001\" which represent the beginning balances. Specifically:\n\n1. Cash deposit on 2023-12-31: 3,000,000.0\n2. Bank deposit on 2023-12-31: 5,000,000.0\n\nThese initial deposits represent the cash and cash equivalents available at the beginning of the period. The cash flow statement would start with these amounts as the beginning balance.\n\nAdding these amounts:\n3,000,000.0 (Cash deposit) + 5,000,000.0 (Bank deposit) = 8,000,000.0\n\nThis is the total beginning cash and cash equivalents balance that should appear in the cash flow statement.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
