This means that all the collected taxes are still payable.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the increase in tax payable\nSince we started with zero tax payable (assuming there was no opening balance mentioned in the data) and collected 39,589.16 in taxes, with no payments to tax authorities, the net increase in tax payable is 39,589.16.\n\nHowever, I need to verify if there is any indication of a different starting balance for tax payable in the given data. Since there's no explicit indication of a different starting balance, I'll use the calculated amount.\n\nTherefore, the \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" value for the cash flow statement is 39,589.16, which I'll round to two decimal places: 39,589.16.\n\nWait, I need to check my approach. For a cash flow statement, we need to show the change in tax payable. All the tax amounts I identified are from sales transactions and represent tax collected. In a cash flow statement, this would be presented as the increase in tax payable.\n\nLet me verify my calculation once more:\n\nThe total tax amount collected from all sales during the period is 39,589.16. This is the amount that the business now owes to tax authorities that it didn't owe at the beginning of the period (assuming no opening balance). Therefore, there is an increase in tax payable of 39,589.16.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '39589.16'} }\n```",
