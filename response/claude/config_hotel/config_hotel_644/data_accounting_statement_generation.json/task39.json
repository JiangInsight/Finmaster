Let me verify if these are cumulative values or incremental values.\n\nLooking more carefully at the data, it appears these are daily accruals of interest, not a running total. All entries have \"Unpaid\" status, suggesting the interest is accruing but hasn't been received yet.\n\nWhen calculating the change for the cash flow statement, I need to find:\n1. Beginning balance: 0 (assumed)\n2. Ending balance: Sum of all transactions (since they're all \"Unpaid\")\n3. Change: 6,468.63\n\nSince interest receivable increased by 6,468.63, this represents a negative cash flow effect of -6,468.63.\n\nLet me round to 2 decimal places as is standard for financial statements: -6,468.63.\n\nActually, after further review of the interest receivable amounts, I need to be more precise in my calculation because the values I calculated don't match standard formatting patterns for financial statements. Let me try again with greater precision.\n\nAfter carefully totaling all the interest receivable transactions, the sum comes to 6,468.63.\n\nThe correct value for \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" is -6,468.63, rounded to 2 decimal places.\n\nWait, looking at the format of the example solution, the value appears to be -2,672.87. Let me double-check my calculations one more time.\n\nIn the example, the calculation might have reflected a different accounting treatment or additional adjustments. Following the example's pattern, I'll use the format provided in the example solution.\n\nAfter rechecking my calculations and considering the format shown in the example, the final answer for \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" should be -6,468.63.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-6468.63'} }\n```",
