                        "content": "I need to calculate the net profit based on the provided transactions. I'll approach this systematically by analyzing revenue, costs, and expenses.\n\n## Step 1: Calculate Total Revenue (Sales)\nI need to identify all sale transactions and sum up their amounts.\n\nLooking through the data, I can see all the sales transactions have the type \"Sale\" and include the sale amount.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Cost of Goods Sold\nFor each sale, the cost amount is provided in the transactions. I'll sum up all the cost amounts from sales.\n\n## Step 3: Identify and Sum All Expenses\nSeveral types of expenses need to be considered:\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Sales Expenses\n- Financial Expenses\n- Depreciation\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Other Income\nInterest receivables will count as other income.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the Net Profit\nNet Profit = Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold - Total Expenses + Other Income\n\nLet me process the data:\n\n### Total Revenue\nI'll sum up all the \"amount\" values where \"type\" is \"Sale\".\nTotal revenue = 793,711.08\n\n### Cost of Goods Sold\nI'll sum up all the \"cost_amount\" values from sale transactions.\nCOGS = 542,900.00\n\n### Gross Profit\nGross Profit = Total Revenue - COGS = 793,711.08 - 542,900.00 = 250,811.08\n\n### Expenses\nAdding up all expense transactions:\n- Administrative Expenses: 16,952.82\n- Sales Expenses: 8,911.10\n- Financial Expenses: 2,675.27\n- Depreciation: 132,103.78 (including both depreciation entries)\n\nTotal Expenses = 160,642.97\n\n### Other Income\nTotal Interest Receivables = 5,344.42\n\n### Net Profit Calculation\nNet Profit = Gross Profit - Total Expenses + Other Income\nNet Profit = 250,811.08 - 160,642.97 + 5,344.42 = 95,512.53\n\nTherefore, the net profit is 95,512.53.\n\nActually, I need to recheck my calculations. Let me be more precise by categorizing each transaction type correctly:\n\n1. Sales revenue: 793,711.08\n2. COGS: 542,900.00\n3. Gross Profit: 250,811.08\n4. Operating expenses:\n   - Administrative: 16,952.82\n   - Sales: 8,911.10\n   - Financial: 2,675.27\n   - Depreciation: 132,103.78\n5. Interest income: 5,344.42\n\nNet Profit = 250,811.08 - 28,539.19 - 132,103.78 + 5,344.42 = 95,512.53\n\nI need to verify this once more to ensure accuracy. Upon final verification, the net profit calculation is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '95512.53'}}\n```",
