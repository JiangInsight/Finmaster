Owner's equity represents the business owner's residual interest in the company after deducting liabilities from assets.\n\nLet me analyze the data step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify initial owner's equity\nLooking at the initial transactions on 2023-12-31, the company started with:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.00\n\nTherefore, the total initial owner's equity is: 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 8,000,000.00 = 16,000,000.00\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the effect of all transactions on owner's equity\nTo determine the ending owner's equity, I need to consider all impacts on equity through:\n- Profits from sales\n- Expenses\n- Depreciation\n- Interest receivables\n\nLet me categorize and sum the transactions:\n\n1. **Sales (Revenue)**: All \"Sale\" entries, focusing on the amount column\n   - Total sales amount: 843,125.92\n\n2. **Expenses**: All \"Expense\" entries\n   - Administrative Expenses: 19,374.68\n   - Sales Expenses: 8,910.32\n   - Financial Expenses: 2,675.27\n   - Total expenses: 30,960.27\n\n3. **Depreciation**: All \"Depreciation\" entries\n   - 45,751.50 (on 2024-01-01)\n   - 86,352.28 (on 2024-02-01)\n   - Total depreciation: 132,103.78\n\n4. **Interest Receivables**: All \"Interest\" entries\n   - Total interest receivable: 5,633.63\n\n### Step 3: Calculate net change in owner's equity\nNet change = Revenue - Expenses - Depreciation + Interest Receivables\nNet change = 843,125.92 - 30,960.27 - 132,103.78 + 5,633.63 = 685,695.50\n\n### Step 4: Calculate ending owner's equity\nEnding owner's equity = Initial owner's equity + Net change\nEnding owner's equity = 16,000,000.00 + 685,695.50 = 16,685,695.50\n\nTherefore, the total owner's equity values are:\n- Initial value: 16,000,000.00\n- End value: 16,685,695.50\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Owners Equity Initial Value': '16000000.00', 'Total Owners Equity End Value': '16685695.50'}}\n```",
