I'll analyze the transactions to determine operating activities, investing activities, and the resulting impact on cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the initial cash and bank balances\n- Initial cash deposit: $3,000,000.00\n- Initial bank deposit: $5,000,000.00\n- Total beginning balance: $8,000,000.00\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Net Profit\nLooking at the sales and expenses:\n- Total Sales (cash and receivables): ~$766,396.19\n- Cost of Goods Sold: ~$442,420.00\n- Gross Profit: ~$323,976.19\n- Operating Expenses (Administrative, Sales, Financial): ~$31,274.41\n- Depreciation: $132,103.78 (45,751.50 + 86,352.28)\n- Net Profit = $160,598.00\n\n## Step 3: Analyze changes in working capital accounts\n\n### Accounts Receivable\n- Initial: $0\n- Final (unpaid sales): $304,222.16\n- Change: -$304,222.16 (increase)\n\n### Interest Receivable\n- Initial: $0\n- Final: ~$5,847.86\n- Change: -$5,847.86 (increase)\n\n### Inventory\n- Initial: $0\n- Purchases: $9,841,870.00\n- Cost of Goods Sold: $442,420.00\n- Final: $9,399,450.00\n- Change: -$9,399,450.00 (increase)\n\n### Accounts Payable\n- Initial: $0\n- Unpaid purchases: $5,871,780.00\n- Change: $5,871,780.00 (increase)\n\n### Tax Payable\n- Initial: $0\n- Tax from sales: $38,319.80\n- Change: $38,319.80 (increase)\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n- Net Profit: $160,598.00\n- Depreciation (add back): $132,103.78\n- (Increase) in Accounts Receivable: -$304,222.16\n- (Increase) in Interest Receivable: -$5,847.86\n- (Increase) in Inventory: -$9,399,450.00\n- Increase in Accounts Payable: $5,871,780.00\n- Increase in Tax Payable: $38,319.80\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -$3,506,718.44\n\n## Step 5: Calculate Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: $3,415,664.34\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -$3,415,664.34\n\n## Step 6: Calculate Ending Cash Balance and Net Increase\n- Beginning Balance: $8,000,000.00\n- Operating Activities: -$3,506,718.44\n- Investing Activities: -$3,415,664.34\n- Ending Balance: $1,077,617.22\n- Net Increase: -$6,922,382.78\n\nNow I will format this as the required JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": \"\",\n  \"Net Profit\": \"160598.00\",\n  \"Depreciation\": \"132103.78\",\n  \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-304222.16\",\n  \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-5847.86\",\n  \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-9399450.00\",\n  \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"5871780.00\",\n  \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"38319.80\",\n  \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-3506718.44\",\n  \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"\",\n  \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"3415664.34\",\n  \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-3415664.34\",\n  \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": \"\",\n  \"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\",\n  \"Ending Balance\": \"1077617.22\",\n  \"Net Increase\": \"-6922382.78\"\n}}\n```\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": \"\", \"Net Profit\": \"160598.00\", \"Depreciation\": \"132103.78\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-304222.16\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-5847.86\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-9399450.00\", \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"5871780.00\", \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"38319.80\", \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-3506718.44\", \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"\", \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"3415664.34\", \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-3415664.34\", \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": \"\", \"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\", \"Ending Balance\": \"1077617.22\", \"Net Increase\": \"-6922382.78\"} }",
