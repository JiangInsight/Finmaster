Date discrepancy:\n   - The recorded date in the table is \"2024-02-15\"\n   - The invoice text says \"On January 21, 2024\"\n   \n2. Amount discrepancy:\n   - The recorded amount is $1396.24\n   - The invoice text shows $1239.90\n   \n3. Price discrepancy:\n   - The recorded unit price is $209.12\n   - The invoice text shows $247.98\n   \n4. Tax amount discrepancy:\n   - The recorded tax amount is $1409.23\n   - The invoice text shows $62.00\n   \n5. Verification using other fields:\n   - For a sale of 5 units of Quick Meal Set (F001) at cost $150/unit:\n   - Total cost amount is $750 (which matches both the table and invoice)\n   - Original profit of $489.90 is consistent with original amount $1239.90 minus cost $750\n   - Original tax of $62.00 is approximately 5% of the original amount\n   - Recorded tax of $1409.23 is extremely high (over 100% of the amount)\n\nThe invoice text is more reliable and internally consistent, showing this is a transaction from January 21, 2024 with an amount of $1239.90, unit price of $247.98, and tax of $62.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-21', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-15', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '247.98', 'Recorded price': '209.12', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '1239.90', 'Recorded amount': '1396.24', 'Original tax': '62.00', 'Recorded tax': '1409.23', 'Original profit': '489.90', 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240121063'} }\n```",
