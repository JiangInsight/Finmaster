Let me look through the data systematically, comparing invoice descriptions with the recorded information.\n\nFor transaction ID \"Sale20240124075\", I notice discrepancies:\n\n1. The recorded_type is \"Sales Expenses\" but the invoice describes a sale transaction.\n2. The recorded_amount (2613.69) doesn't match the invoice amount (2249.84).\n3. The recorded_unit_price (495.65) doesn't match the invoice price (562.46).\n\nLooking at the invoice:\n\"On January 24, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 4.0 units at a unit price of $562.46, totaling $2249.84. The cost amount for this transaction was $1400.00, with a tax amount of $112.49, leading to a total amount due of $2137.35. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\nThe invoice is more reliable, and it clearly describes this as a Sale transaction with different values than what was recorded in the database.\n\nFor transaction ID \"Initial20231231001\", there are three rows with the same ID but different amounts. While unusual, this doesn't necessarily indicate an error without more information.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '562.46', 'Recorded price': '495.65', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '2249.84', 'Recorded amount': '2613.69', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240124075'} }",
