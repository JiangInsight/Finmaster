Transaction ID starts with \"Sale\" but is recorded as \"Administrative Expenses\" in the type field\n2. The date in the recorded_date (2024-02-13) doesn't match what's stated in the invoice (January 29, 2024)\n3. The unit price in recorded_unit_price (2290.1) differs from what's shown in recorded_amount divided by recorded_quantity (2102.57 รท 1 = 2102.57)\n\nThe invoice description states:\n\"On January 29, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $2102.57, totaling $2102.57.\"\n\nThis confirms the transaction should be:\n- Category: \"Sale\" (not \"Administrative Expenses\")\n- Date: \"2024-01-29\" (not \"2024-02-13\")\n- Unit price: $2102.57 (not $2290.1)\n\nSince the invoice is considered more reliable, these are clearly errors in the recorded fields.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-29\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-02-13\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Original price\": \"2102.57\", \"Recorded price\": \"2290.1\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\", \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": \"2102.57\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": \"105.13\", \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": \"602.57\", \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240129097\"}}\n```",
