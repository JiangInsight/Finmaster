The **recorded_quantity** is 1.0, but the invoice mentions \"consisting of 2.0 units\"\n2. The **recorded_payment/receipt_status** is \"Paid\", but the invoice states \"this transaction was unpaid\"\n3. The **recorded_profit** is $358.46, but based on calculations:\n   - Original calculation: 2 units × $495.18 = $990.36 (total) - $700.00 (cost) = $290.36\n   - Current recorded calculation: 1 unit × $495.18 = $495.18 - $350.00 (cost for 1 unit) = $145.18\n\nThe profit discrepancy ($358.46 vs expected $145.18 for 1 unit or $290.36 for 2 units) suggests additional errors in the calculation.\n\nThe most reliable source is the invoice text which indicates 2 units, a total amount of $990.36, and an unpaid status.\n\n## Final Analysis:\nFor Sale20240109023:\n- Original quantity: 2.0 (from invoice)\n- Recorded quantity: 1.0\n- Original payment/receipt_status: \"Unpaid\" (from invoice)\n- Recorded payment/receipt_status: \"Paid\"\n- Original profit: $290.36 (calculated from invoice details)\n- Recorded profit: $358.46\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '2.0', 'Recorded quantity': '1.0', 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': '290.36', 'Recorded profit': '358.46', 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240109023'} }",
