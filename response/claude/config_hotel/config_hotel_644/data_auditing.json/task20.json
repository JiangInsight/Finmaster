The ID starts with \"Purchase\" but the recorded_type is \"Financial Expenses\"\n2. The invoice explicitly states it's a Purchase: \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Purchase...\"\n3. The unit price in the invoice is stated as $2000.00, but the recorded_unit_price is $2180.79\n4. All other fields such as the quantity (298 units), supplier, and product match between the recorded data and invoice\n\nThis transaction has two errors:\n- Incorrect transaction type (Financial Expenses instead of Purchase)\n- Incorrect unit price ($2180.79 instead of $2000.00)\n\n## Solution\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Purchase', 'Recorded category': 'Financial Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '2000.0', 'Recorded price': '2180.79', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Purchase20231231013'} }\n```",
