Based on this analysis, I can provide a solution with the correct values:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Depreciation\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-14\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-02-13\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"5.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"3.0\", \"Original price\": \"1167.98\", \"Recorded price\": \"1169.51\", \"Original receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original amount\": \"5839.90\", \"Recorded amount\": \"3503.94\", \"Original tax\": \"292.00\", \"Recorded tax\": \"4605.94\", \"Original profit\": \"1439.90\", \"Recorded profit\": \"1439.9\", \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240114042\"}}\n```",
