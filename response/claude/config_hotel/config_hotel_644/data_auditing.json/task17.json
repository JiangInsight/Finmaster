The Fixed Assets amount is listed as 8,000,000 but according to the invoice text, it should be 5,000,000. Need to check this further.\n\nActually, after closer examination, the total for all three Initial20231231001 entries equals 16,000,000 (3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 8,000,000), but individually the invoice descriptions match each line's amount. So this seems correct.\n\n## Transaction ID: Sale20240112034\nThis entry has several inconsistencies:\n1. The category is recorded as \"Sales Expenses\" but the invoice clearly describes a \"Sale\" transaction\n2. The receive_method is recorded as \"Interest receivable\" but the invoice states it was paid in \"cash\"\n\nThis is a significant error where both the transaction category and payment method are misclassified.\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': 'Cash', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Interest receivable', 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240112034'} }\n```",
