In the recorded fields, the quantity is 4.0 units, but the invoice text says \"consisting of 5.0 units\"\n2. The recorded amount is $7,512.23, while the invoice says \"totaling $6,639.95\"\n3. The recorded unit price is $1,369.41, while the invoice says \"at a unit price of $1,327.99\"\n4. The recorded tax amount is $7,487.54, which is unreasonably high for this transaction and doesn't match the invoice's stated \"tax amount of $332.00\"\n\n## Initial20231231001\nThere appears to be a discrepancy with the Fixed Assets record. The invoice describes it as totaling $8,000,000.00, which matches the recorded amount. This doesn't appear to be an error.\n\n## Sale20240130057\nThe recorded quantity is 2.0, but the invoice mentions 3.0 units. The recorded amount ($49,533.50) doesn't match the invoice amount ($74,300.25). The recorded tax amount of $81,724.53 is extremely high compared to the invoice's mention of $3,715.01. The recorded unit price ($25,021.15) doesn't match the invoice's $24,766.75.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the most significant inconsistencies appear in transactions Sale20240113039 and Sale20240130057.\n\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Original quantity\": \"5.0\",\n  \"Recorded quantity\": \"4.0\",\n  \"Original price\": \"1327.99\",\n  \"Recorded price\": \"1369.41\",\n  \"Original amount\": \"6639.95\",\n  \"Recorded amount\": \"7512.23\",\n  \"Original tax\": \"332.00\",\n  \"Recorded tax\": \"7487.54\",\n  \"id\": \"Sale20240113039\"\n}}",
