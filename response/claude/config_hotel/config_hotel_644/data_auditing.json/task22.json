The recorded date is \"2024-02-02\" but the invoice states \"On January 12, 2024\"\n2. The recorded unit price is $2365.85, but the invoice mentions the total as $2821.83 and unit price should match this (since quantity is 1)\n3. The calculation in the invoice ($2821.83 - tax $141.09 = $2680.74) is consistent\n\nThis is a clear inconsistency where both the date and price are incorrect compared to the invoice description, which is considered more reliable.\n\nLooking at the rest of the entries, I don't see any other inconsistencies where the recorded information contradicts the invoice description.\n\nFor Sale20240112035, the correct date should be 2024-01-12 as stated in the invoice, and the correct unit price should be $2821.83 as stated in the invoice calculation.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-12', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-02', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '2821.83', 'Recorded price': '2365.85', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240112035'} }\n```",
