The transaction type is incorrectly recorded as \"Sales Expenses\" when it should be \"Sale\"\n2. The tax amount is incorrectly recorded as $1352.85 when it should be $63.85\n\nThis is likely a data entry error where the transaction type was misclassified and the tax amount was significantly inflated.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": \"63.85\", \"Recorded tax\": \"1352.85\", \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240122069\"}}\n```",
