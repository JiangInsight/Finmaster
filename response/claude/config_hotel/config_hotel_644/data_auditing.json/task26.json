Type mismatch: It should be a \"Sale\" not \"Sales Expenses\"\n2. Date mismatch: It should be \"2024-01-20\" not \"2024-02-13\"\n3. Amount mismatch: It should be $2804.05 not $3432.05\n\nSince the invoice is generally considered more reliable due to its standardized and regulated nature, I'll use the invoice information as the correct values.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original date': '2024-01-20', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-13', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '5.0', 'Recorded quantity': '5.0', 'Original price': '560.81', 'Recorded price': '560.81', 'Original receive_method': 'Cash', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Cash', 'Original amount': '2804.05', 'Recorded amount': '3432.05', 'Original tax': '140.20', 'Recorded tax': '140.20', 'Original profit': '1054.05', 'Recorded profit': '1054.05', 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240120061'} }\n```",
