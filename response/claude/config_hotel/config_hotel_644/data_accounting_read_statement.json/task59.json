Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nLet me examine each financial statement carefully:\n\n### Balance Sheet Analysis:\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, I can see \"Interest Receivable\" with an end amount of 6494.02. This represents interest that has accrued but not yet been received.\n\n### Cash Flow Statement Analysis:\nIn the Cash Flow Statement, I can see \"Net Increase\" of -5335190.97 under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section. This represents the net change (in this case a decrease) in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\n### Income Statement Analysis:\nThe Income Statement shows \"Interest Income\" of 6494.02, which matches the Interest Receivable from the Balance Sheet.\n\nTherefore:\n- The interest accrued but not yet received (value1) is 6494.02\n- The net addition in cash and cash equivalents (value2) is -5335190.97\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '6494.02', 'value2': '-5335190.97'} }\n```",
