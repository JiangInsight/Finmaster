                        "content": "I need to identify the cash held by the entity that is available for day-to-day operations.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, there are two line items that represent cash:\n1. Cash on Hand: Initial amount = 3000000.00, End amount = 2105753.37\n2. Bank Deposits: Initial amount = 5000000.00, End amount = 559055.66\n\nBoth of these represent cash that would be available for day-to-day operations. In accounting, these would typically be combined to represent the total cash position.\n\nSo the total initial cash value would be:\n3000000.00 + 5000000.00 = 8000000.00\n\nAnd the total end cash value would be:\n2105753.37 + 559055.66 = 2664809.03\n\nHowever, based on the example provided, it seems we're only supposed to consider \"Cash on Hand\" as the available cash for day-to-day operations.\n\nSo my answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"3000000.00\", \"end value\": \"2105753.37\"}}\n```",
