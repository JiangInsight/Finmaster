Looking at the cash flow statement provided, I can see that there is a line item explicitly labeled \"Depreciation\" under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\nThe value associated with the \"Depreciation\" line item is 132,103.78 as of 2024-02-01.\n\nTherefore, the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life is represented by the \"Depreciation\" line item with a value of 132,103.78.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '132103.78'}}\n```",
