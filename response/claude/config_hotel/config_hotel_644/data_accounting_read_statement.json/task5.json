The initial value (as of 2023-12-31) is 0.00\n3. The end value (as of 2024-02-01) is 7446940.00\n\nInventory represents goods held for sale in the ordinary course of business, goods in production for such sale, or materials to be consumed in the production process. This is exactly what the task is asking for.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '7446940.00'}}\n```",
