I need to find the line item related to inventory changes.\n2. In a cash flow statement, \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" represents changes in inventory levels.\n3. When this value is negative, it means inventory increased (company spent cash to increase inventory).\n4. When this value is positive, it means inventory decreased (company reduced inventory, freeing up cash).\n\nIn the given cash flow statement, I see the following line:\n\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with a value of \"-7446940.00\"\n\nThis negative value indicates that inventory increased (rather than decreased) during the period. The company spent $7,446,940.00 to increase inventory levels.\n\nSince the task is asking for the reduction in inventory (or other assets held for sale), and the inventory actually increased rather than decreased, the answer is the value as stated in the cash flow statement: -7446940.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-7446940.00'}}\n```",
