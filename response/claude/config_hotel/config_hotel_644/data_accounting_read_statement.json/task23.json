These typically include interest income, dividend income, investment income, or gains from financial instruments.\n\nIn the given income statement, I can see a line item called \"Interest Income\" with a value of 6494.02. Interest income represents earnings from financial assets like deposits, bonds, or loans, so this is what I'm looking for.\n\nI don't see any other line items that would indicate income from financial assets (such as dividend income, investment income, etc.).\n\nTherefore, the value of income earned from financial assets is 6494.02.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '6494.02'}}\n```",
