Beginning Balance: 8000000.00\n2. Ending Balance: 2664809.03\n\nThe relationship is: Ending Balance - Beginning Balance = Net Increase\n2664809.03 - 8000000.00 = -5335190.97\n\nThis confirms that the net increase is correctly calculated as the difference between the ending and beginning cash balances.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-5335190.97', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_item value2': '2664809.03'}} }\n```",
