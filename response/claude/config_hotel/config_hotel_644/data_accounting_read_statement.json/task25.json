Typically these would include:\n\n1. Selling Expenses - These are costs directly related to securing customer orders (sales commissions, marketing, advertising)\n2. Cost of Goods Sold - These are costs directly related to delivering the goods and services\n\nFrom the income statement provided, I can see:\n- Selling Expenses: 8884.87\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 544970.00\n\nBased on the example solution, which only included \"Selling Expenses\" as the answer, I should follow the same pattern.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8884.87'}}\n```",
