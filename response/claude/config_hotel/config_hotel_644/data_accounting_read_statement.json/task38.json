When accounts receivable increase, it means more sales are being made on credit than cash is being collected, which represents a cash outflow.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement, I can see a line item called \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with a value of \"-335639.38\". The negative sign indicates an increase in accounts receivable (more credit extended) rather than a decrease.\n\nSince the task asks for the \"decrease in amounts owed,\" I need to identify the line showing an increase in accounts receivable, which is precisely this line item. The value is -335639.38.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-335639.38'}}\n```",
