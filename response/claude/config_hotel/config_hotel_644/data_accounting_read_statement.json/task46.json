The negative sign indicates that cash was used rather than generated.\n\nThe only sub-item contributing to this amount is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of 3415664.34 (shown as a positive number in the statement, but it represents a cash outflow).\n\nTherefore:\n- The value of net cash flow from investing activities is: -3415664.34\n- The sub-item value (Purchase of Fixed Assets) is: 3415664.34\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-3415664.34', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '3415664.34'}}}\n```",
