This is exactly what I'm looking for.\n\nThe balance sheet shows:\n- Initial value for \"Interest Receivable\" is 0.00 as of 2023-12-31\n- End value for \"Interest Receivable\" is 6494.02 as of 2024-02-01\n\nThis is confirmed by the cash flow statement which shows \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" of -6494.02, indicating an increase in interest receivable (negative because it's a use of cash).\n\nThe income statement also shows \"Interest Income\" of 6494.02, which matches the amount that has accrued during the period.\n\nTherefore, the interest accrued but not yet received has an initial value of 0.00 and an end value of 6494.02.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '6494.02'} }\n```",
