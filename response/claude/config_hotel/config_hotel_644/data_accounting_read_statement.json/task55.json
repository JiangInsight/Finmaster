In the balance sheet, I see \"Taxes Payable\" with an end amount of 41,840.70 as of 2024-02-01.\n\n2. In the cash flow statement, I see \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an amount of 41,840.70.\n\n3. Most importantly, in the income statement, I see a specific line item \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of 41,840.70.\n\nThe \"Tax Expense\" line in the income statement represents the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period. This is the most direct measure of the tax obligation for the period.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '41840.70'}}\n```",
