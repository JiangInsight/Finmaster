Costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services: This refers to \"Selling Expenses\"\n2. Financing costs incurred for production and operation: This refers to \"Financial Expenses\"\n3. Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset: This refers to \"Depreciation\"\n4. Total amount of taxes expected to pay or recover: This refers to \"Tax Expense\"\n\nLooking at the income statement:\n- Selling Expenses: 8884.87\n- Depreciation: 132103.78\n- Financial Expenses: 2675.27\n- Tax Expense: 41840.70\n\nI'll return these values in the original order they appear in the income statement:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '8884.87', 'value2': '2675.27', 'value3': '132103.78', 'value4': '41840.70'}}\n```\n\nWait, I need to be careful about the order. Looking at the examples, I should maintain the original order as shown in the input statement. In the income statement, the order is:\n- Selling Expenses\n- Depreciation\n- Financial Expenses\n- Tax Expense\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '8884.87', 'value2': '132103.78', 'value3': '2675.27', 'value4': '41840.70'}}\n```",
