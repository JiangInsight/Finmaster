In the balance sheet, I can see that \"Accounts Payable\" went from 0.00 on 2023-12-31 to 5,596,070.00 on 2024-02-01. Accounts payable represents amounts owed for goods and services purchased on credit.\n\n2. The cash flow statement confirms this change with a line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" showing 5,596,070.00.\n\nThis represents the increase in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit during the period. Since the initial value was 0.00, this entire amount represents the addition.\n\nTherefore, the value of the addition in the amount owed is 5,596,070.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5596070.00'} }\n```",
