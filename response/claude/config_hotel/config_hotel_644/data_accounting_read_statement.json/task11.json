Retained earnings represent accumulated profits (or losses) that have been retained in the business rather than distributed as dividends.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial value of Retained Earnings (as of 2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End value of Retained Earnings (as of 2024-02-01): 99532.29\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '99532.29'}}\n```",
