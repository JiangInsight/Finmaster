In the balance sheet, I see \"Accumulated Depreciation\" with an end amount of 132,103.78 as of 2024-02-01. This represents the total accumulated depreciation, not the current period's depreciation.\n\n2. In the cash flow statement, there's a line item \"Depreciation\" with a value of 132,103.78.\n\n3. In the income statement, there's also a line item \"Depreciation\" with a value of 132,103.78.\n\nBoth the cash flow statement and income statement show the same depreciation amount for the current period (132,103.78), which represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of assets over their useful lives during this reporting period.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '132103.78'} }\n```",
