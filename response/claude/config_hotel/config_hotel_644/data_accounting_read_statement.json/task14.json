In the balance sheet, I can see:\n\n1. \"Total Current Liabilities\" line item which shows:\n   - Initial amount: 0.00 (on 2023-12-31)\n   - End amount: 5637910.70 (on 2024-02-01)\n\nCurrent liabilities include accounts payable and taxes payable, both of which are typically settled within the normal operating cycle of a business.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of liabilities expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '5637910.70'}}\n```",
