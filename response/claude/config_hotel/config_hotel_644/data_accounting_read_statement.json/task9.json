This is exactly what I'm looking for.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- The initial amount for \"Taxes Payable\" as of 2023-12-31 is 0.00\n- The end amount for \"Taxes Payable\" as of 2024-02-01 is 41840.70\n\nThese values represent the tax liability that has been recorded but not yet paid to tax authorities at the beginning and end of the reporting period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '41840.70'}}\n```",
