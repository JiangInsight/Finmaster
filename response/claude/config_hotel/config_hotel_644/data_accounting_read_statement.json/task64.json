Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense - this is the \"Profit Before Tax\" line in the income statement\n2. Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit - this is the \"Accounts Payable\" line in the balance sheet (the End_amount)\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares - this is the \"Paid-in Capital\" line in the balance sheet (the End_amount)\n\nLooking at the statements:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- Paid-in Capital: 16000000.00\n- Accounts Payable: 5596070.00\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- Profit Before Tax: 141372.99\n\nTherefore, my solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16000000.00', 'value2': '141372.99', 'value3': '5596070.00'}}\n```",
