When accounts payable increases (positive value), it means the company has added to the amount it owes suppliers for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\nSince the value is positive (5,596,070.00), it indicates an increase in accounts payable, which is what we're looking for - the addition to the amount owed for goods/services received on credit during the period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5596070.00'}}\n```",
