First, calculating the Gross Profit Margin:\n   Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\n   \n   From the income statement:\n   - Gross Profit = $291,843.79\n   - Total Revenue = $836,813.79\n   \n   Gross Profit Margin = ($291,843.79 / $836,813.79) × 100% = 34.88%\n\n2. For the Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\n   Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n   \n   From the cash flow statement:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$1,919,526.63\n   \n   From the balance sheet:\n   - Total Current Liabilities = $5,637,910.70\n   \n   Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -$1,919,526.63 / $5,637,910.70 = -0.34\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '34.88%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.34'}}\n```",
