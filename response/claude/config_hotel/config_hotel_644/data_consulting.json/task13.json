                        "content": "I need to calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio, which measures how efficiently a company is managing its inventory. This ratio is typically calculated as:\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nLet me extract the necessary information:\n\n1. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) from the income statement: $544,970.00\n\n2. For Average Inventory, I need the beginning and ending inventory values:\n   - Beginning Inventory (from initial balance sheet): $0.00\n   - Ending Inventory (from ending balance sheet): $7,446,940.00\n\nAverage Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2\nAverage Inventory = ($0.00 + $7,446,940.00) / 2 = $3,723,470.00\n\nNow, I can calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio:\nInventory Turnover Ratio = $544,970.00 / $3,723,470.00 = 0.1464\n\nHowever, the financial statements appear to cover only a 1-month period (from December 31, 2023 to February 1, 2024). To get an annualized ratio, I would typically multiply by 12, but since we're just calculating the ratio based on the data provided, I'll keep it as is.\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: 0.15\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.15'} }\n```",
