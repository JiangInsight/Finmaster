From the cash flow statement, I can see that the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is -1,919,526.63\n\n2. From the balance sheet, I can see that the Total Current Liabilities is 5,637,910.70\n\nNow I'll calculate the ratio:\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -1,919,526.63 / 5,637,910.70 = -0.3404\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places, the ratio is -0.34.\n\nThis negative ratio indicates that the company's operations are not generating enough cash to cover its current liabilities, which could be a concern for short-term liquidity.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.34'} }\n```",
