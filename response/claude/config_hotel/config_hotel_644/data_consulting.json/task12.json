The formula for ROE is:\n\nROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity\n\nStep 1: Find the Net Income from the income statement.\n- Net Profit = $99,532.29\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Average Shareholders' Equity.\n- Beginning Shareholders' Equity = $16,000,000.00 (Initial amount from the balance sheet)\n- Ending Shareholders' Equity = $16,099,532.29 (End amount from the balance sheet)\n- Average Shareholders' Equity = ($16,000,000.00 + $16,099,532.29) / 2 = $16,049,766.15\n\nStep 3: Calculate ROE.\n- ROE = $99,532.29 / $16,049,766.15 = 0.0062 or 0.62%\n\nTherefore, the Return on Equity (ROE) is 0.62%.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.62%'} }\n```",
