Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: From the cash flow statement, this is -$1,919,526.63\n2. Current Liabilities: From the balance sheet, the Total Current Liabilities as of 2024-02-01 is $5,637,910.70\n\nNow I'll calculate the ratio:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$1,919,526.63 / $5,637,910.70 = -0.34047...\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: -0.34\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.34'} }\n```",
