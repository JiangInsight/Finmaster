                        "content": "I need to calculate three financial ratios based on the given financial statements: Debt to Equity Ratio, Net Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\nLet me calculate each ratio step by step:\n\n## 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThe formula is: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $5,637,910.70\n- Total Equity = Total Owner's Equity = $16,099,532.29\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $5,637,910.70 / $16,099,532.29 = 0.35\n\n## 2. Net Profit Margin\nThe formula is: (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = $99,532.29\n- Total Revenue = $836,813.79\n\nNet Profit Margin = ($99,532.29 / $836,813.79) × 100% = 11.89%\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThe formula is: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$1,919,526.63\n- Total Current Liabilities = $5,637,910.70\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -$1,919,526.63 / $5,637,910.70 = -0.34\n\nTherefore, my solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.35\", \"Net Profit Margin\": \"11.89%\", \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.34\"}}\n```",
