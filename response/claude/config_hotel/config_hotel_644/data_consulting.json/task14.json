This ratio measures how efficiently a company collects its accounts receivable and is calculated as:\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nStep 1: Find Net Credit Sales\nFrom the income statement, we can see that:\n- Total Revenue (which we'll use as Net Credit Sales) = $836,813.79\n\nStep 2: Calculate Average Accounts Receivable\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable (Initial_amount) = $0.00\n- Ending Accounts Receivable (End_amount) = $335,639.38\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable = (Beginning + Ending)/2\nAverage Accounts Receivable = ($0.00 + $335,639.38)/2 = $167,819.69\n\nStep 3: Calculate Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $836,813.79 / $167,819.69 = 4.99\n\nSince the answer needs to be rounded to 2 decimal places:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '4.99'} }",
