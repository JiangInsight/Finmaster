                        "content": "I need to calculate three financial ratios based on the financial statements provided. Let me solve this step by step.\n\n## 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\nThe debt to asset ratio is calculated as: Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = $5,637,910.70 (Total Current Liabilities)\n- Total Assets = $21,737,442.99\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $5,637,910.70 / $21,737,442.99 = 0.2593 ≈ 0.26\n\n## 2. Gross Profit Margin\nThe gross profit margin is calculated as: (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = $291,843.79\n- Total Revenue = $836,813.79\n\nGross Profit Margin = ($291,843.79 / $836,813.79) × 100% = 34.88%\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThe operating cash flow ratio is calculated as: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$1,919,526.63\n- Total Current Liabilities = $5,637,910.70\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$1,919,526.63 / $5,637,910.70 = -0.34\n\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.26', 'Gross Profit Margin': '34.88%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.34'}}",
