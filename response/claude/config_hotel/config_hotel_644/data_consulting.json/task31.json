                        "content": "I'll solve this task by calculating each of the required financial ratios step by step.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\nFormula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nSince we have only one period of accounts receivable data, I'll use the end amount:\n- Net Credit Sales (Revenue): $836,813.79\n- Accounts Receivable: $335,639.38\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $836,813.79 / $335,639.38 = 2.49\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to cover its current liabilities with its operating cash flow.\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\n- Operating Cash Flow: -$1,919,526.63\n- Current Liabilities: $5,637,910.70\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$1,919,526.63 / $5,637,910.70 = -0.34\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio calculated above: -0.34\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\nFormula: Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\n- Net Sales: $836,813.79\n- Average Total Assets: ($16,000,000.00 + $21,737,442.99) / 2 = $18,868,721.50\n\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = $836,813.79 / $18,868,721.50 = 0.04\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures a company's financial leverage.\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities: $5,637,910.70\n- Total Equity: $16,099,532.29\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $5,637,910.70 / $16,099,532.29 = 0.35\n\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.49', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-0.34', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.34', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.04', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.35'}}",
