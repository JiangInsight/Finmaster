Looking at the data again:\n\n- First fixed asset purchase (Central AC4): 830,405.75\n- Second fixed asset purchase (Kitchen Equipment5): 383,011.45\n\nSince both were paid by bank transfer, they are cash outflows for investing activities.\nNet Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -(830,405.75 + 383,011.45) = -1,213,417.20\n\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-1213417.20'}}",
