This involves finding the net change in accounts payable during the period.\n\nLet me identify all purchases made on \"Account Payable\" payment method that remained unpaid:\n\n1. First, I'll find all purchases with payment method \"Account Payable\":\n\nPurchase20231231002: 696,960.00 (Banquet Set)\nPurchase20231231003: 394,560.00 (Banquet Set)\nPurchase20231231004: 286,000.00 (Business Room)\nPurchase20231231008: 544,000.00 (Business Room)\nPurchase20231231009: 43,400.00 (Business Meal Set)\nPurchase20231231010: 21,900.00 (Quick Meal Set)\nPurchase20231231011: 163,500.00 (Standard Room)\nPurchase20231231012: 235,500.00 (Standard Room)\nPurchase20231231013: 466,560.00 (Banquet Set)\nPurchase20231231015: 800,000.00 (Luxury Suite)\nPurchase20231231017: 78,400.00 (Business Meal Set)\nPurchase20231231018: 64,750.00 (Business Meal Set)\nPurchase20231231019: 1,075,000.00 (Luxury Suite)\nPurchase20231231020: 236,720.00 (Deluxe Meal Set)\nPurchase20231231021: 1,115,000.00 (Luxury Suite)\nPurchase20231231022: 88,880.00 (Deluxe Meal Set)\nPurchase20231231025: 570,240.00 (Banquet Set)\n\n2. Adding up all these account payable purchases:\nTotal accounts payable = 6,881,370.00\n\nSince all of these purchases were made on 2023-12-31 with \"Unpaid\" status and \"Account Payable\" payment method, and I don't see any payments made toward accounts payable during January 2024, the increase in accounts payable is 6,881,370.00.\n\nHowever, looking more carefully at the formatting and typical accounting standards, I should present this as:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '6881370.00'} }\n```\n\nWait, let me check for any payments made toward accounts payable during the period before finalizing.\n\nLooking through the transactions again, I don't see any payments specifically designated as paying down existing accounts payable from the initial balance. Since all these purchases were made on 2023-12-31 and remained unpaid, they represent the increase in accounts payable during the period.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '6881370.00'}}",
