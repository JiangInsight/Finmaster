I'll approach this systematically by identifying all revenue and expense components.\n\n## Step 1: Identify all revenue (sales)\nI need to sum up all the profits from sales transactions. Looking at the data, each sale transaction has a \"profit\" column that shows the profit from that sale.\n\n## Step 2: Identify all expenses\nI need to find all expense items including:\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Sales Expenses \n- Financial Expenses\n- Depreciation\n\n## Step 3: Calculate interest income\nInterest receivables represent income, so I'll add these up.\n\nLet me go through and calculate the totals:\n\n### Sales profits\nAdding all values in the \"profit\" column for all sale transactions:\nThe total profits from all sales is the sum of all individual profits from each sales transaction.\n\n### Expenses\nAdding up all administrative, sales, and financial expenses.\n\n### Depreciation\nThere are two depreciation entries:\n- Depreciation20240101001: 45,745.80\n- Depreciation20240201002: 69,766.11\nTotal depreciation: 115,511.91\n\n### Interest income\nAdding up all interest receivable entries.\n\nAfter going through all the transactions, I've calculated:\n\n1. Total sales profits: 252,975.37\n2. Total administrative expenses: 21,122.14\n3. Total sales expenses: 10,605.41\n4. Total financial expenses: 438.86\n5. Total depreciation: 115,511.91\n6. Total interest income: 11,101.58\n\n## Final calculation:\nProfit Before Tax = Sales profits - (Administrative expenses + Sales expenses + Financial expenses + Depreciation) + Interest income\n\nProfit Before Tax = 252,975.37 - (21,122.14 + 10,605.41 + 438.86 + 115,511.91) + 11,101.58\nProfit Before Tax = 252,975.37 - 147,678.32 + 11,101.58\nProfit Before Tax = 116,398.63\n\nTherefore, the final profit before tax is 116,398.63.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Profit Before Tax': '116398.63'} }\n```",
