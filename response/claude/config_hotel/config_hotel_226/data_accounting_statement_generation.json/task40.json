In that case, the inventory change would be:\n\nBeginning inventory = 8,862,650.00\nCost of goods sold = 501,550.00\nEnding inventory = Beginning inventory - Cost of goods sold = 8,862,650.00 - 501,550.00 = 8,361,100.00\n\nInventory change (for cash flow) = Beginning inventory - Ending inventory\n                                 = 8,862,650.00 - 8,361,100.00\n                                 = 501,550.00\n\nBut taking a closer look at the problem, I need to determine the specific inventory impact on the cash flow statement. In a cash flow statement, we report:\n- Net income\n- Add back non-cash expenses (depreciation)\n- Adjust for changes in working capital (including inventory)\n\nSince an increase in inventory represents a use of cash, it's shown as a negative number in the cash flow statement, while a decrease appears as a positive number.\n\nIn this case, the inventory decreased by 501,550.00, but I need to present it as \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\", so it should be positive.\n\nWait, I need to double-check this. Since all purchases are dated 2023-12-31, they represent the beginning inventory, not purchases during the period we're analyzing. The inventory decreased during the period because we sold items without purchasing new ones.\n\nBut actually, looking at the purchases, it appears these are actual purchase transactions, not a beginning balance. So these should be treated as increases to inventory during the period.\n\nTherefore:\n- Inventory increased by 8,862,650.00 (purchases)\n- Inventory decreased by 501,550.00 (cost of goods sold)\n- Net inventory change = -8,361,100.00\n\nFor the cash flow statement, an increase in inventory is a use of cash and is shown as a negative number, so the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" would be -8,361,100.00.\n\nActually, let me double-check the beginning/ending dates. I see that the purchases are all dated 2023-12-31, while the sales start from 2024-01-02. This suggests that the purchases represent the beginning inventory at the start of the period. \n\nFor a proper cash flow statement, we would need:\n1. Beginning inventory (as of 2023-12-31): 8,862,650.00\n2. Ending inventory (as of 2024-02-02): 8,361,100.00\n3. Change in inventory: 8,862,650.00 - 8,361,100.00 = 501,550.00\n\nHowever, since all purchases are dated at the beginning of the period and there are no additional purchases during the period, I believe we need to recognize the full inventory value as a cash outflow at the beginning.\n\nGiven the format of the cash flow statement item \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\", the negative sign indicates cash used for inventory increase. Therefore, the value should be -8,361,100.00.\n\nAfter reviewing the example, I see that the expected format is a negative number with two decimal places, shown with single quotes. The inventory balance increased (a use of cash), so the answer should be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-8361100.00'} }\n```\n\nActually, I've been making a mistake. Looking back at the purchases, they are all dated 2023-12-31, which suggests they represent the beginning inventory. If we're calculating a cash flow statement for the period from January 2024 onwards, we should not include these as cash flows during the period.\n\nInstead, we should focus on the change in inventory during the reporting period. The beginning inventory (from the purchases) was 8,862,650.00, and after deducting cost of goods sold of 501,550.00, the ending inventory would be 8,361,100.00.\n\nFor a cash flow statement, we report the change as \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\". Since inventory decreased by 501,550.00 (from 8,862,650.00 to 8,361,100.00), this would be a positive number in the cash flow statement.\n\nBut wait - is this the right way to calculate it? If all purchases are dated 2023-12-31, they're technically before our reporting period. If we're measuring cash flow during the period, we shouldn't be including these purchases in our calculation.\n\nGiven the complexity, let me revise my approach by comparing with the example solution. The example had a solution of -5090000.00, which suggests that all purchases were treated as occurring within the reporting period, regardless of their date.\n\nLooking at the example, it seems that I should simply calculate:\n1. Total purchases: 8,862,650.00\n2. Total cost of goods sold: 501,550.00\n3. Net increase in inventory: 8,862,650.00 - 501,550.00 = 8,361,100.00\n\nSince this represents an increase in inventory (a use of cash), it appears as a negative number in the cash flow statement:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-8361100.00'} }\n```\n\nHowever, upon closer examination of our data, I need to make sure I'm accounting for all inventory-related transactions correctly. Let me recheck the purchases to ensure I'm including only inventory items and not fixed assets or other non-inventory purchases.\n\nActually, after careful review, I notice that the problem has a specific format for the answer. Looking at the sample solution of '-5090000.00', I need to match this format exactly.\n\nSo my final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-8361100.00'} }\n```",
