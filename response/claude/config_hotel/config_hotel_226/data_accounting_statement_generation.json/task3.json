In the problem, I initially calculated the total inventory purchased as $8,962,650, but I realize I need to focus specifically on the initial inventory.\n\nSince all purchases were made on 2023-12-31 and precede any sales, the initial inventory value is the sum of all these purchases: $8,962,650.\n\nFor the final inventory value, I need to subtract the cost of goods sold from the initial inventory. Based on my detailed tracking of units sold for each product, the final inventory value is $8,476,060.\n\nLet me round these values appropriately:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Initial Value': '8962650.00', 'Inventory End Value': '8476060.00'} }\n```",
