This involves finding the total sales revenue and subtracting the cost of goods sold.\n\nLet me approach this step by step:\n\n1. First, I need to identify all sales transactions (rows with \"type\" containing \"Sale\")\n2. For each sale, I'll collect the relevant financial data (revenue and cost)\n3. Calculate the gross profit by subtracting total cost from total revenue\n\nLet me go through the data:\n\nLooking at all rows where \"type\" contains \"Sale\", I can see each sale transaction includes:\n- amount: the revenue including tax\n- after_tax_amount: the revenue excluding tax\n- cost_amount: the cost of goods sold for this transaction\n- profit: the profit for this transaction (amount - cost_amount)\n\nSince gross profit is revenue minus cost of goods sold, I need to sum up all the revenue and subtract the sum of all costs.\n\nFor each sale entry, I'll examine the values in the \"profit\" column, which already represents the gross profit for each individual transaction.\n\nAdding up all values in the \"profit\" column for sales transactions:\n\nThe data shows many sales with their associated profit values. Summing all these \"profit\" values gives us the total gross profit.\n\nAfter calculating the sum of all profit values from the sales transactions, I get:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit': '266563.17'} }\n```",
