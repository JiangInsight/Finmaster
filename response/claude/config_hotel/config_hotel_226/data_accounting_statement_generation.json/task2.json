Bank transfers outgoing (payments made from bank account)\n2. Bank transfers incoming (cash to bank transfers)\n3. Any direct payments or receipts via bank\n\nLet me analyze these transactions:\n\n### Bank transfers outgoing:\n- FixedAsset20231231001 (payment): 830,405.75\n- Purchase20231231014 (payment): 34,500.00 \n- FixedAsset20231231001 (payment): 383,011.45\n\n### Bank transfers incoming (cash to bank):\nNone in this dataset.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the ending balance\nStarting balance: 5,000,000.00\n\nSubtract outgoing bank transfers:\n- 5,000,000.00 - 830,405.75 - 34,500.00 - 383,011.45 = 3,752,082.80\n\nSo the ending bank deposits balance is 3,752,082.80\n\n## Step 4: Verify by checking for other bank-related transactions\nLet me double-check if there are any other transactions affecting the bank account that I might have missed:\n\nLooking through all transactions with \"Bank Transfer\" as payment method, I've confirmed all the relevant transactions have been included in my calculation.\n\nTherefore, the bank deposits values are:\n- Initial value: 5,000,000.00\n- End value: 3,752,082.80\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Bank Deposits Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Bank Deposits End Value': '3752082.80'} }\n```",
