                        "content": "I need to calculate the total owner's equity at the beginning and end of the period based on the transactions data. Let me approach this systematically.\n\n## Step 1: Identify Initial Owner's Equity\nThe initial owner's equity can be found in the transactions marked as \"Initial\" from the beginning of the period:\n\n- Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 3,000,000.00\n- Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 5,000,000.00\n- Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 8,000,000.00\n\nThe total initial owner's equity is the sum of these values = 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 8,000,000.00 = 16,000,000.00\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the Change in Owner's Equity\nTo find the end value, I need to determine how the equity changed over the period. This involves:\n\n1. Identifying all revenues (sales)\n2. Subtracting all expenses (including depreciation)\n3. Determining the net income or loss\n\n### Revenues\nAll transactions marked as \"Sale\" contribute to revenue.\nAdding up all the sales transactions from 2024-01-02 to 2024-02-02:\n- Total sales amount: 717,778.40 (sum of all \"Sale\" entries)\n\n### Expenses\nThese include:\n- Administrative expenses: 20,289.08\n- Sales expenses: 13,082.76\n- Financial expenses: 438.86\n- Depreciation: 115,511.91 (45,745.80 + 69,766.11)\n- Other expenses: 0\n\n### Calculate Net Income\nNet Income = Total Revenue - Total Expenses\nNet Income = 717,778.40 - (20,289.08 + 13,082.76 + 438.86 + 115,511.91)\nNet Income = 717,778.40 - 149,322.61\nNet Income = 568,455.79\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Ending Owner's Equity\nEnding Owner's Equity = Beginning Owner's Equity + Net Income\nEnding Owner's Equity = 16,000,000.00 + 568,455.79\nEnding Owner's Equity = 16,568,455.79\n\nTherefore:\n- Total Owners Equity Initial Value: 16,000,000.00\n- Total Owners Equity End Value: 16,568,455.79\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Owners Equity Initial Value': '16000000.00', 'Total Owners Equity End Value': '16568455.79'} }\n```",
