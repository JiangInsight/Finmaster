This includes both the physical cash and the bank deposits that are considered part of \"cash and cash equivalents\" in financial reporting.\n\nNote that the fixed assets initial deposit of 8,000,000.00 is not included in cash and cash equivalents as fixed assets are non-current assets and not part of the cash or cash equivalents category.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
