This suggests that the initial accumulated depreciation is 0.00.\n\n## Step 2: Identify all depreciation transactions\nNow I'll identify all depreciation transactions in the dataset:\n\n1. `Depreciation20240101001` - January 1, 2024 - Amount: 45,745.80\n2. `Depreciation20240201002` - February 1, 2024 - Amount: 69,766.11\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the accumulated depreciation values\n- Initial accumulated depreciation: 0.00\n- First depreciation: 45,745.80\n- Second depreciation: 69,766.11\n- Final accumulated depreciation: 0.00 + 45,745.80 + 69,766.11 = 115,511.91\n\nHowever, since the task is to calculate the accumulated depreciation at the end of January 2024 (based on the transaction dates), the end value would be:\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- End value (January 31, 2024): 45,745.80\n\nThis is because the second depreciation entry (69,766.11) is recorded on February 1, 2024, which falls outside the January period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accumulated Depreciation End Value': '45745.80'} }\n```",
