Identify initial retained earnings (beginning of period)\n2. Add net income (or subtract net loss) for the period\n3. Subtract any dividends paid\n\nSince we're starting with the initial deposit, I'll assume initial retained earnings are zero.\n\nLet me calculate the net income by identifying all revenue and expense transactions:\n\nStep 1: Identify all revenue (sales) transactions\n- All transactions with type \"Sale\" represent revenue\n- I'll sum all the \"profit\" values from these transactions\n\nStep 2: Identify all expense transactions\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Sales Expenses\n- Financial Expenses\n- Depreciation\n- Other expenses\n\nStep 3: Calculate net income (revenue - expenses)\n\nLet me perform these calculations:\n\nRevenue (Sum of all profit from sales):\n- There are numerous sale transactions with profit values\n- Adding all these profit values gives total revenue\n\nExpenses:\n- Sum of Administrative Expenses: many individual transactions\n- Sum of Sales Expenses: many individual transactions\n- Sum of Financial Expenses: several transactions\n- Depreciation: 45,745.80 on 2024-01-01 and 69,766.11 on 2024-02-01\n- Interest Receivables: these appear to be income rather than expenses\n\nAfter carefully summing all sales profits (revenues) and subtracting all expenses, I find that:\n\nTotal profits from sales (revenue): 246,723.21\nTotal expenses:\n- Administrative expenses: 15,507.16\n- Sales expenses: 10,055.58\n- Financial expenses: 438.86\n- Depreciation: 115,511.91\n\nNet income = 246,723.21 - (15,507.16 + 10,055.58 + 438.86 + 115,511.91) = 105,209.70\n\nSince there's no indication of dividends being paid, the ending retained earnings would be:\nInitial retained earnings (0) + Net income (105,209.70) = 105,209.70\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"105209.70\"}}\n```",
