Total profit from sales: Looking at all \"Sale\" transactions, the sum of the profit column is approximately 242,862.77.\n\n2. Total expenses:\n   - Administrative Expenses: 16,835.68\n   - Sales Expenses: 11,560.25\n   - Financial Expenses: 438.86\n   - Depreciation: 115,511.91\n\n   Total expenses: 16,835.68 + 11,560.25 + 438.86 + 115,511.91 = 144,346.70\n\n3. Interest Income: Approximately 12,342.50 (sum of all Interest Receivables transactions)\n\n4. Net Profit = 242,862.77 - 144,346.70 + 12,342.50 = 110,858.57\n\nTherefore, the final net profit is approximately 110,858.57.\n\nActually, let me verify my calculations by looking more carefully at the data again. After a more detailed review and calculation:\n\nThe total profit from all sales transactions is approximately 242,862.77.\nThe total expenses are approximately 144,346.70.\nThe total interest income is approximately 12,342.50.\n\nNet Profit = 242,862.77 - 144,346.70 + 12,342.50 = 110,858.57\n\nTherefore, the net profit is 110,858.57.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '110858.57'} }\n```",
