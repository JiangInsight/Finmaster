ROE measures how efficiently a company uses its equity to generate profits.\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\nROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity\n\nStep 1: Identify the Net Income from the income statement.\nNet Income = $112,375.10\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Average Shareholders' Equity.\nBeginning Shareholders' Equity = $16,000,000.00 (Initial_amount from balance sheet)\nEnding Shareholders' Equity = $16,112,375.10 (End_amount from balance sheet)\nAverage Shareholders' Equity = ($16,000,000.00 + $16,112,375.10) / 2 = $16,056,187.55\n\nStep 3: Calculate ROE.\nROE = $112,375.10 / $16,056,187.55 = 0.006998 or approximately 0.70%\n\nStep 4: Convert to percentage format with two decimal places.\nROE = 0.70%\n\nTherefore, the Return on Equity (ROE) for this company is 0.70%.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.70%'}}\n```",
