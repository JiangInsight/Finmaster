ROA is calculated as Net Income divided by Average Total Assets, expressed as a percentage.\n\nStep 1: Identify the Net Income\nFrom the income statement, the Net Profit (Net Income) is $112,375.10.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Average Total Assets\n- Total Assets at the beginning (Initial_amount from balance sheet): $16,000,000.00\n- Total Assets at the end (End_amount from balance sheet): $23,717,525.01\n- Average Total Assets = ($16,000,000.00 + $23,717,525.01) / 2 = $19,858,762.51\n\nStep 3: Calculate ROA\nROA = Net Income / Average Total Assets\nROA = $112,375.10 / $19,858,762.51\nROA = 0.00566 or 0.57%\n\nTherefore, the Return on Assets (ROA) is 0.57%.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Assets (ROA)': '0.57%'} }\n```",
