ROE (Return on Equity) = Net Profit / Total Owner's Equity\n2. Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n3. Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Total Revenue\n\nNow, let's calculate each ratio using the data from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Return on Equity (ROE)**:\n   - Net Profit = $112,375.10\n   - Total Owner's Equity = $16,112,375.10\n   - ROE = $112,375.10 / $16,112,375.10 = 0.00697 or approximately 0.70%\n\n2. **Debt to Asset Ratio**:\n   - Total Liabilities = $7,605,149.91\n   - Total Assets = $23,717,525.01\n   - Debt to Asset Ratio = $7,605,149.91 / $23,717,525.01 = 0.3206 or approximately 0.32\n\n3. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit = $279,378.77\n   - Total Revenue = $775,598.77\n   - Gross Profit Margin = $279,378.77 / $775,598.77 = 0.3601 or approximately 36.01%\n\nNow I'll format these values as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.70%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.32', 'Gross Profit Margin': '36.01%'} }\n```",
