                        "content": "I need to calculate the Total Asset Turnover Ratio, which measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales revenue.\n\nThe formula for Total Asset Turnover Ratio is:\nTotal Asset Turnover = Net Sales (Revenue) / Average Total Assets\n\nLet's calculate each component:\n\n1. Net Sales (Revenue): From the income statement, Total Revenue = $775,598.77\n\n2. Average Total Assets:\n   - Beginning Total Assets (Initial): $16,000,000.00\n   - Ending Total Assets: $23,717,525.01\n   - Average Total Assets = ($16,000,000.00 + $23,717,525.01) / 2 = $19,858,762.51\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio = $775,598.77 / $19,858,762.51 = 0.0391\n\nSince this appears to be for a short period (just over a month from Dec 31 to Feb 2), the turnover ratio is quite low, which is expected as turnover ratios are typically measured on an annual basis.\n\nTherefore, the Total Asset Turnover Ratio is 0.04 (rounded to 2 decimal places).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.04'} }\n```",
