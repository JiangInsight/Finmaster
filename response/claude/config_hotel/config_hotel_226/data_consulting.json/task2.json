Current Assets at the end date (2024-02-02): $14,619,619.72\n2. Inventory at the end date (2024-02-02): $8,466,430.00\n3. Current Liabilities at the end date (2024-02-02): $7,605,149.91\n\nNow, I'll calculate the Quick Ratio:\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\nQuick Ratio = ($14,619,619.72 - $8,466,430.00) / $7,605,149.91\nQuick Ratio = $6,153,189.72 / $7,605,149.91\nQuick Ratio = 0.8090\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.81\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '0.81'}}\n```",
