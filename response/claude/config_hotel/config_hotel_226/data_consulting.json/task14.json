                        "content": "I need to calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio, which measures how efficiently a company collects credit sales from customers.\n\nThe formula for Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is:\n```\nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n```\n\nLet me break this down step by step:\n\n1. First, I need to find the Net Credit Sales from the income statement:\n   - Net Credit Sales = Main Business Revenue = $775,598.77\n\n2. Next, I need the Average Accounts Receivable:\n   - Beginning Accounts Receivable (from Initial_amount) = $0.00\n   - Ending Accounts Receivable (from End_amount) = $321,015.98\n   - Average Accounts Receivable = ($0.00 + $321,015.98) / 2 = $160,507.99\n\n3. Now I can calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:\n   - Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $775,598.77 / $160,507.99 = 4.83\n\n4. Rounding to 2 decimal places: 4.83\n\nTherefore, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is 4.83.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '4.83'} }\n```",
