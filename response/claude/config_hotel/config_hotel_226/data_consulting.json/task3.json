The Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated by dividing Total Liabilities by Total Assets.\n\nStep 1: Identify the Total Liabilities from the balance sheet.\n- The Total Current Liabilities at the end of the reporting period is $7,605,149.91\n- There are no non-current liabilities reported\n- Therefore, Total Liabilities = $7,605,149.91\n\nStep 2: Identify the Total Assets from the balance sheet.\n- The Total Assets at the end of the reporting period is $23,717,525.01\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio.\n- Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n- Debt to Asset Ratio = $7,605,149.91 / $23,717,525.01\n- Debt to Asset Ratio = 0.32066... â‰ˆ 0.32\n\nTherefore, the Debt to Asset Ratio as of the end of the reporting period is 0.32.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.32'} }\n```",
