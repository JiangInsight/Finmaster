Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -967,147.02\n   - Total Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91\n   - Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -967,147.02 / 7,605,149.91 = -0.127\n\n2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n   - Total Liabilities = 7,605,149.91\n   - Total Owner's Equity = 16,112,375.10\n   - Debt to Equity Ratio = 7,605,149.91 / 16,112,375.10 = 0.472\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n   - Total Revenue = 775,598.77\n   - Average Total Assets = (16,000,000.00 + 23,717,525.01) / 2 = 19,858,762.51\n   - Total Asset Turnover Ratio = 775,598.77 / 19,858,762.51 = 0.039\n\n4. Quick Ratio\n   - Quick Assets = Cash + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n   - Quick Assets = 2,067,352.98 + 3,752,082.80 + 12,737.96 + 321,015.98 = 6,153,189.72\n   - Total Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91\n   - Quick Ratio = 6,153,189.72 / 7,605,149.91 = 0.809\n\n5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -967,147.02\n   - Total Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91\n   - Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -967,147.02 / 7,605,149.91 = -0.127\n   (Same as Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio)\n\n6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n   - Net Profit = 112,375.10\n   - Average Equity = (16,000,000.00 + 16,112,375.10) / 2 = 16,056,187.55\n   - ROE = 112,375.10 / 16,056,187.55 = 0.007 = 0.7%\n\n7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n   - Total Revenue = 775,598.77\n   - Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 321,015.98) / 2 = 160,507.99\n   - Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 775,598.77 / 160,507.99 = 4.831\n\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.127', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.472', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.039', 'Quick Ratio': '0.809', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.127', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.7%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '4.831'}}",
