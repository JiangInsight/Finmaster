                        "content": "I'll calculate the three required financial ratios step by step.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nThis ratio measures the relationship between a company's operating cash flow and its net income.\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$967,147.02\n- Net Profit = $112,375.10\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = -$967,147.02 / $112,375.10 = -8.61\n\n## 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio (also known as Turnover Ratio)\n\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate revenue.\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Current Assets\n\nFrom the financial statements:\n- Total Revenue = $775,598.77\n- Beginning Current Assets = $8,000,000.00\n- Ending Current Assets = $14,619,619.72\n- Average Current Assets = ($8,000,000.00 + $14,619,619.72) / 2 = $11,309,809.86\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = $775,598.77 / $11,309,809.86 = 0.07\n\n## 3. Quick Ratio\n\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without relying on inventory sales.\n\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = $14,619,619.72\n- Inventory = $8,466,430.00\n- Current Liabilities = $7,605,149.91\n\nQuick Ratio = ($14,619,619.72 - $8,466,430.00) / $7,605,149.91 = $6,153,189.72 / $7,605,149.91 = 0.81\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-8.61', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.07', 'Quick Ratio': '0.81'} }\n```",
