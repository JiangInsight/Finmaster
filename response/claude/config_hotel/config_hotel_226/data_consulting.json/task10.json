The operating cash flow (from cash flow statement)\n2. The current liabilities (from balance sheet)\n\nFrom the cash flow statement, I can see:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -967,147.02\n\nFrom the balance sheet, I can see:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91\n\nThe Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio is calculated as:\nOperating Cash Flow รท Current Liabilities\n\nCalculation:\n-967,147.02 รท 7,605,149.91 = -0.1271709...\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places:\n-0.13 or -13%\n\nTherefore, the operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio is -0.13.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.13'} }\n```",
