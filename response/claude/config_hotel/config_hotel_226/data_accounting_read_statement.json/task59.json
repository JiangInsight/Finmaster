The net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nLet me analyze each statement:\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet\nLooking at the balance sheet, I can see \"Interest Receivable\" with an end amount of 12737.96. This represents interest that has accrued but not yet been received.\n\n### 2. Income Statement\nThe income statement shows \"Interest Income\" of 12737.96, which matches the Interest Receivable amount.\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nFor the net addition in cash and cash equivalents, I need to look at the cash flow statement. Under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents,\" I can see \"Net Increase\" of -2180564.22, which represents the net change in cash during the period (negative value indicates a decrease).\n\nTherefore:\n- Value 1 (interest accrued but not yet received): 12737.96\n- Value 2 (net addition in cash and cash equivalents): -2180564.22\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '12737.96', 'value2': '-2180564.22'}}\n```",
