This account specifically tracks interest that has been earned but not yet collected.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- The initial value of Interest Receivable as of 2023-12-31 is 0.00\n- The end value of Interest Receivable as of 2024-02-02 is 12737.96\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '12737.96'}}\n```",
