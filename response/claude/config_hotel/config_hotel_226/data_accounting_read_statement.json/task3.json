Accounts receivable represents money that customers owe the company for products or services that have been delivered but not yet paid for.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial value of Accounts Receivable (2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End value of Accounts Receivable (2024-02-02): 321015.98\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '321015.98'}}\n```",
