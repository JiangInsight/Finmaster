So I need to look for the \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" line item.\n\nIn the cash flow statement provided, I can see:\n\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with a value of \"-321015.98\"\n\nThe negative sign indicates this is an increase in accounts receivable (since it's labeled \"(Increase) Decrease\", a negative value means an increase). This means more money is owed to the entity compared to the previous period.\n\nHowever, the task asks specifically for a \"decrease\" in amounts owed. Since the accounts receivable increased (shown by the negative value), there is no decrease to report. But the task asks for the specific line item and value that represents this concept, which is the \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" line with value \"-321015.98\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-321015.98'}}\n```",
