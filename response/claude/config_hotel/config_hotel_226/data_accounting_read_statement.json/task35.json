Costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services to customers: This refers to \"Selling Expenses\"\n2. Financing costs incurred for raising funds for production/operation: This refers to \"Financial Expenses\"\n3. Systematic allocation of depreciable assets over useful life: This refers to \"Depreciation\"\n4. Total amount of taxes expected to pay/recover: This refers to \"Tax Expense\"\n\nLooking at the income statement provided:\n- Selling Expenses = 10967.95\n- Depreciation = 115511.91\n- Financial Expenses = 438.86\n- Tax Expense = 38779.91\n\nI need to present these values in the original order they appear in the income statement. From the example, it seems the order should be: Selling Expenses, Depreciation, Financial Expenses, and Tax Expense.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '10967.95', 'value2': '115511.91', 'value3': '438.86', 'value4': '38779.91'}}\n```",
