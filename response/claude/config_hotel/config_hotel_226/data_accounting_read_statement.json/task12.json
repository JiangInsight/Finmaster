This matches with the items listed under the Total Current Assets section (Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, Accounts Receivable, and Inventory).\n\nTherefore, the initial value and end value of the assets expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal operating cycle are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '14619619.72'}}\n```",
