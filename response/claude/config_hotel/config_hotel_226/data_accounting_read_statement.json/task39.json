A positive value would indicate a decrease in inventory (cash inflow from reduced inventory).\n\nSince the value is negative (-8466430.00), this indicates an increase in inventory rather than a reduction. However, the task specifically asks for the value of reduction in assets held for sale, which would be this inventory figure.\n\nTherefore, the value representing the change in inventory (assets held for sale) is -8466430.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-8466430.00'}}\n```",
