This represents the increase in tax that has been accrued but not yet paid during the period.\n\nIn cash flow statements, positive values in operating activities typically represent increases in liabilities (or decreases in assets), which contribute positively to cash flow. The positive value here indicates that tax payable has increased, meaning more tax has been accrued than was paid during this period.\n\nTherefore, the value for the increase in the amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid is 38779.91.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '38779.91'}}\n```",
