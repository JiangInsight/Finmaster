The amounts owed BY the entity (payables)\n\nStep 1: For receivables, I need to find the line item that represents money owed to the company. This would be \"Accounts Receivable\" in a balance sheet.\n- Looking at the balance sheet, I can see \"Accounts Receivable\" with an initial value of 0.00 on 2023-12-31\n- The end value for \"Accounts Receivable\" is 321015.98 on 2024-02-02\n\nStep 2: For payables, I need to find the line item that represents money the company owes to others. This would be \"Accounts Payable\" in a balance sheet.\n- Looking at the balance sheet, I can see \"Accounts Payable\" with an initial value of 0.00 on 2023-12-31\n- The end value for \"Accounts Payable\" is 7566370.00 on 2024-02-02\n\nTherefore, my solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '0.00', 'end valu1': '321015.98', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '7566370.00'}}\n```",
