Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense (from Income Statement)\n2. Addition in amount owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit (from Balance Sheet)\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares (from Balance Sheet)\n\nLet me examine each financial statement:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- \"Accounts Payable\" shows End_amount: 7566370.00, which represents the amount owed for goods/services received on credit\n- \"Paid-in Capital\" shows End_amount: 16000000.00, which represents capital contributed by shareholders\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- \"Profit Before Tax\" shows Amount: 151155.01, which is the profit or loss before deducting tax expense\n\nTherefore, the three values I need to extract are:\n1. Paid-in Capital: 16000000.00\n2. Profit Before Tax: 151155.01\n3. Accounts Payable: 7566370.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16000000.00', 'value2': '151155.01', 'value3': '7566370.00'}}\n```",
