Reduction in inventory\n3. Net cash flow from investing activities\n4. Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n\nLet me analyze the statement carefully:\n\n1. Depreciation is listed directly as \"Depreciation\" with a value of 115511.91\n\n2. The change in inventory is shown as \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with a value of -8466430.00. The negative sign indicates it's an increase in inventory (reduction in cash).\n\n3. Net cash flow from investing activities is shown as \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with a value of -1213417.20\n\n4. The net change in cash and cash equivalents during the period is shown as \"Net Increase\" with a value of -2180564.22\n\nMaintaining the original order from the statement:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '115511.91', 'value2': '-8466430.00', 'value3': '-1213417.20', 'value4': '-2180564.22'}}\n```",
