Cash on Hand refers to physical currency and coins, while Bank Deposits represent money in bank accounts that is readily available.\n\nAccording to accounting principles, both of these line items together represent the cash available for use in day-to-day operations. Therefore, I need to sum these values.\n\nInitial value = 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 8,000,000.00\nEnd value = 2,067,352.98 + 3,752,082.80 = 5,819,435.78\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection of the example in the task, it appears that only \"Cash on Hand\" was extracted as the cash for day-to-day operations, not including Bank Deposits. Since I should follow the given example pattern:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '3000000.00', 'end value': '2067352.98'}}\n```",
