In the balance sheet, I see \"Accumulated Depreciation\" with an end amount of 115,511.91.\n\n2. In the cash flow statement, I see \"Depreciation\" with an amount of 115,511.91.\n\n3. In the income statement, I see \"Depreciation\" with an amount of 115,511.91.\n\nThe systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life is precisely what depreciation represents. The value consistently shown across the financial statements is 115,511.91.\n\nTherefore, the value I need to extract is 115,511.91.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '115511.91'} }\n```",
