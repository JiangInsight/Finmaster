Let me continue checking other transactions:\n\n- I note that the Expense20240128001 transaction shows a discrepancy between its recorded type (Sales Expenses) and the invoice which states it's an Administrative Expenses. Also, the amount in the invoice ($22,083.91) differs from the recorded amount ($23,867.23).\n\nLooking through the entire dataset, these are the most notable inconsistencies I've found.\n\nFor the Expense20240128001 transaction, the invoice is more reliable, so I'll report this discrepancy:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"22083.91\", \"Recorded amount\": \"23867.23\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Expense20240128001\"}}\n```",
