The recorded date (2024-02-16) differs from the date in the invoice (2024-01-25)\n2. The recorded quantity (2.0) differs from the invoice (3.0)\n3. The recorded unit price (1691.13) differs from the invoice (1974.41)\n4. The recorded amount (3948.82) differs from the calculated invoice amount (5923.23)\n\nThe recorded amount (3948.82) doesn't match either calculation:\n- Invoice calculation: 3 units × 1974.41 = 5923.23\n- Recorded calculation: 2 units × 1691.13 = 3382.26 (which still doesn't match 3948.82)\n\nLet me continue examining the data for any other inconsistencies...\n\nI've reviewed the rest of the transactions and found just the one with clear inconsistencies. The Sale20240125078 transaction shows multiple discrepancies between the recorded information and what's stated in the invoice, which is considered more reliable.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-25', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-16', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '3.0', 'Recorded quantity': '2.0', 'Original price': '1974.41', 'Recorded price': '1691.13', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '5923.23', 'Recorded amount': '3948.82', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240125078'} }",
