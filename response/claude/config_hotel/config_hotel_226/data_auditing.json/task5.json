The correct quantity can be verified from the invoice, and this error affects the recorded amount.\n\n## Analyzing Initial20231231001\nLooking at the three rows with ID \"Initial20231231001\":\n- The third row shows recorded amount of 8000000.0, while the invoice says \"totaling $8000000.00\" for \"Fixed Assets\"\n- But the previous two rows for the same ID show 3000000.0 and 5000000.0 for \"Cash deposit\" and \"Bank deposit\"\n- This appears consistent with the sum equaling 8000000.0\n\nThere appears to be no inconsistency here.\n\n## Scanning other transactions\nAfter reviewing other transactions, I don't see any further inconsistencies between the recorded values and the invoice descriptions. Most of the transactions appear to have correct quantities, amounts, tax amounts, and other details that match what's described in the invoice.\n\nThe only clear inconsistency I've found is in Sale20240114044 where the quantity is recorded as 0 but should be 1 according to the invoice.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '1.0', 'Recorded quantity': '0.0', 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '577.85', 'Recorded amount': '0.0', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240114044'} }\n```",
