According to the invoices, there should be separate deposits of $3,000,000 and $5,000,000, and a Fixed Assets amount of $8,000,000.\n\n## Purchase20231231002\nLet me examine this transaction carefully:\n- Recorded type: \"Sales Expenses\"\n- Invoice description mentions: \"an invoice was issued for a Purchase\"\n- Recorded unit price: $2,672.26\n- Invoice mentions: \"unit price of $2,880.00\"\n\nThere's a clear inconsistency between the recorded transaction type and what the invoice states. Also, the unit price appears to be incorrect.\n\nThis is a definite inconsistency where:\n1. The transaction is labeled as \"Sales Expenses\" but should be \"Purchase\"\n2. The unit price is recorded as $2,672.26 but should be $2,880.00 according to the invoice\n\nNo other significant inconsistencies are apparent in the other transactions I've reviewed. The Invoice field appears to be the reliable source of information since it provides detailed descriptions of each transaction.\n\nBased on my analysis, I've identified Purchase20231231002 as having significant inconsistencies between the recorded information and the invoice description.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Purchase\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"2880.0\", \"Recorded price\": \"2672.26\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Purchase20231231002\"}}\n```",
