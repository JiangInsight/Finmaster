The recorded_type is \"Administrative Expenses\" but the ID starts with \"Sale\" and the invoice describes it as a sale transaction\n2. The recorded tax amount seems very high (6933.29) compared to the total amount (7762.79)\n3. The invoice description mentions different amounts than what's recorded in some fields\n\nLet me analyze this row in detail:\n\n- Recorded category: \"Administrative Expenses\" \n- Invoice description shows it's a Sale: \"On January 24, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 4.0 units...\"\n- Recorded amount: 7762.79\n- Invoice description amount: 6317.40 (calculated as unit price × quantity = 1579.35 × 4)\n- Recorded unit price: 1800.10\n- Invoice description unit price: 1579.35\n- Recorded tax amount: 6933.29\n- Invoice description tax amount: 315.87\n- Cost amount: 3520.00 (same in both)\n- After tax amount (in invoice): 6001.53\n\nThis is clearly a sale transaction miscategorized as an expense, with incorrect amounts for the total, unit price, and tax.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"1579.35\", \"Recorded price\": \"1800.1\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"6317.4\", \"Recorded amount\": \"7762.79\", \"Original tax\": \"315.87\", \"Recorded tax\": \"6933.29\", \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240124074\"}}\n```",
