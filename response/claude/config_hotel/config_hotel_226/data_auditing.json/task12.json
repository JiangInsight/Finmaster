This would be unexpected as transaction IDs should be unique.\n\nNext, I'll check for discrepancies between fields and the invoice text, as the invoice is generally considered more reliable.\n\nWorking through each record carefully...\n\nFor transaction `Initial20231231001`, I notice it appears three times with the same ID but different recorded types and amounts. Looking at the invoice details, the Fixed Assets amount shows $8,000,000, but the recorded amount is $5,000,000 in one record.\n\nFor transaction `Purchase20231231005`, the approver field is missing in the recorded data, but the invoice clearly states \"This transaction was prepared by Supervisor, and the approver is Director.\"\n\nChecking transaction `Expense20240115001`, I see that there's a missing approver in the record (shown as empty), but the invoice text states \"This transaction was prepared by Senior Staff, and the approver is Director.\"\n\nI've found a clear inconsistency: Transaction ID `Expense20240115001` is missing the approver in the data, but the invoice text confirms it should be \"Director\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': 'Director', 'Recorded Approver': 'None', 'id': 'Purchase20231231005'} }\n```",
