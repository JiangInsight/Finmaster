The `recorded_type` is \"Administrative Expenses\" but the invoice description and all other details indicate this is clearly a \"Sale\" transaction\n2. The `recorded_date` is \"2024-02-07\" but the invoice specifically states \"On January 18, 2024...\"\n\nThis is a clear inconsistency between the recorded information and the invoice details, which we're treating as the more reliable source.\n\nLet me continue checking for other inconsistencies...\n\nLooking at `Expense20240122001`, there appears to be no inconsistency that I can detect in the table data.\n\nAfter reviewing all records, the only clear inconsistency I found is with `Sale20240118058`, where both the transaction type and date are incorrectly recorded.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-18\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-02-07\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240118058\"}}\n```",
