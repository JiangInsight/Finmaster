Looking for entries with errors by comparing recorded information against the more reliable invoice details.\n\nFirst, I'll focus on transaction ID \"Sale20240123071\" which shows some signs of discrepancy:\n\n1. The recorded_type is \"Financial Expenses\" but the ID starts with \"Sale\" suggesting it should be a sale transaction\n2. The invoice description mentions \"Sale\" not \"Financial Expenses\"\n3. Let me check for quantity, date, and amount discrepancies\n\nFrom the invoice text: \"On January 23, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 4.0 units at a unit price of $2722.27, totaling $10889.08.\"\n\nComparing with recorded data:\n- Recorded category: \"Financial Expenses\" (should be \"Sale\")\n- Recorded date: \"2024-02-12\" (invoice shows \"January 23, 2024\")\n- Recorded quantity: 3.0 (invoice shows 4.0)\n- Recorded price: 3088.31 (invoice shows 2722.27)\n- Recorded amount: 8166.81 (invoice shows 10889.08)\n\nThis transaction clearly has multiple inconsistencies between what was recorded and what the invoice actually states.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Financial Expenses\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-23\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-02-12\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"4.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"3.0\", \"Original price\": \"2722.27\", \"Recorded price\": \"3088.31\", \"Original receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original amount\": \"10889.08\", \"Recorded amount\": \"8166.81\", \"Original tax\": \"544.45\", \"Recorded tax\": \"544.45\", \"Original profit\": \"2889.08\", \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240123071\"}}\n```",
