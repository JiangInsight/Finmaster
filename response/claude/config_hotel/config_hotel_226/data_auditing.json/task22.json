Date discrepancy: Original date (from invoice) is 2024-01-08, but recorded date is 2024-01-14\n2. Unit price discrepancy: Original price (from invoice) is $464.58, but recorded price is $498.47\n\nLet me verify if the total amount calculation is consistent with the unit price in the invoice:\n- 5 units Ã— $464.58 = $2,322.90, which matches the recorded_amount\n- So the invoice price appears to be correct, and the recorded_unit_price is incorrect\n\nI'll also check the data for any other inconsistencies, but these two are clear discrepancies between the recorded information and what's stated in the invoice.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-08', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-14', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '464.58', 'Recorded price': '498.47', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240108027'} }\n```",
