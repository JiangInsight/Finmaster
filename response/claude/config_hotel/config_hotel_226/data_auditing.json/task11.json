Looking at this entry:\n- The recorded_preparer field is empty (None)\n- But the invoice states: \"This transaction was prepared by Staff, and the approver is Director.\"\n\nThis is a clear inconsistency. The recorded_preparer field should contain \"Staff\", but it's missing.\n\nSimilar inspection of \"Expense20240125001\":\n- The recorded_preparer field is empty \n- The invoice states: \"This transaction was prepared by Staff, and the approver is Director.\"\n\nAgain, there's a discrepancy where the preparer information is missing in the record but present in the invoice.\n\nNo other clear inconsistencies appear in the data when comparing the recorded fields with the invoice descriptions. The amounts, dates, and other transaction details appear to be consistent between recorded fields and invoice descriptions.\n\nTherefore, I've identified two instances where the preparer information is missing in the recorded fields despite being mentioned in the invoice.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': 'Staff', 'Recorded Preparer': 'None', 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240106001'} }",
