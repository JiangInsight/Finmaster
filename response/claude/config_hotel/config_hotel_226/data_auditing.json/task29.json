Looking at the invoice description: \n   \"On February 01, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $3564.52, totaling $7129.04. The cost amount was $4000.00, with a tax amount of $356.45, leading to a total amount due of $6772.59. The receive_method was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\n2. Comparing with recorded data:\n   - Recorded date: February 29, 2024 (invoice says February 01, 2024)\n   - Recorded amount: $8682.69 (invoice says $7129.04)\n   - Recorded unit price: $3309.30 (invoice says $3564.52)\n   - Recorded tax amount: $7866.75 (invoice says $356.45)\n\n3. Verifying internal consistency:\n   - Original calculation: 2.0 units × $3564.52 = $7129.04 ✓\n   - Original tax: $356.45 (5% of $7129.04) ✓\n   - Original total due: $7129.04 - $356.45 = $6772.59 ✓\n   \n   The recorded values don't match and don't calculate correctly:\n   - Recorded calculation: 2.0 units × $3309.30 = $6618.60 (not $8682.69) ✗\n   - Recorded tax ($7866.75) is higher than the total amount ($8682.69) ✗\n\nThe invoice information is internally consistent, while the recorded information contains multiple calculation errors and an impossible date (February 29 in a non-leap year).\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-02-01', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-29', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '3564.52', 'Recorded price': '3309.30', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '7129.04', 'Recorded amount': '8682.69', 'Original tax': '356.45', 'Recorded tax': '7866.75', 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240201100'} }",
