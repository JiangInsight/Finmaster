The recorded date is \"2024-01-11\" but the invoice says \"December 31, 2023\"\n2. The recorded amount is $770,477.07, but the invoice states $696,960.00\n3. The recorded unit price is $3,296.26, but the invoice states $2,880.00 per unit\n\nThe invoice is typically considered more reliable, so these are clear inconsistencies.\n\n## Other Transactions\nI've examined all other transactions and found no other significant inconsistencies between the recorded data and the invoice information.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2023-12-31', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-11', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '2880.00', 'Recorded price': '3296.26', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '696960.00', 'Recorded amount': '770477.07', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Purchase20231231002'} }\n```",
