No inconsistency detected.\n\n## Transaction: Expense20240111001 (Administrative Expenses)\nThere's a discrepancy:\n- Recorded amount: 275.07\n- Invoice states: \"totaling $246.77\"\n\nThe invoice amount (246.77) is likely more accurate than the recorded amount (275.07).\n\n## Transaction: Sale20240110016 (Sale - Luxury Suite)\nFor the transaction Sale20240110016, there's a discrepancy:\n- Recorded amount: 138369.24\n- However, calculating from the invoice: \"consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $62344.08, totaling $124688.16\"\n  \nThe total from the unit price × quantity (62344.08 × 2.0) equals 124688.16, which matches the invoice total but not the recorded amount.\n\n## Final Analysis\nI found two discrepancies:\n\n1. Expense20240111001: The recorded amount (275.07) differs from the invoice amount (246.77)\n2. Sale20240110016: The recorded amount (138369.24) doesn't match the calculated and invoice-stated amount (124688.16)\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '246.77', 'Recorded amount': '275.07', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240111001'} }",
