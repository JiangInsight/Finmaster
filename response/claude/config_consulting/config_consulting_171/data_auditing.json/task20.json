The transaction has \"Financial Expenses\" recorded in the recorded_type field, but the invoice description clearly states it's a \"Sale\" transaction.\n\n2. The unit price is recorded as 181173.59 in the recorded_unit_price field, but the invoice indicates a unit price of 196484.20.\n\n3. The after-tax amount in the invoice (186659.99) doesn't correctly align with the basic calculation: total amount minus tax amount should be 196484.20 - 9824.21 = 186659.99, which matches the invoice value.\n\n4. The transaction ID itself starts with \"Sale\", further confirming this is a sales transaction incorrectly categorized as a financial expense.\n\nSo for Sale20240123053, we have two clear inconsistencies:\n1. The recorded transaction type doesn't match the actual transaction type\n2. The recorded unit price doesn't match the price mentioned in the invoice\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Financial Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '196484.2', 'Recorded price': '181173.59', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240123053'} }\n```",
