The recorded_type is \"Financial Expenses\" but the ID starts with \"Sale\" and the invoice clearly describes it as a sale\n2. The recorded_amount (56471.43) doesn't match what's in the invoice (52739.99)\n\nLooking at the invoice details:\n- The transaction is described as a sale of Premium Consulting\n- Amount is stated as 52739.99\n- Other details like unit price, tax amount, and cost amount all align with it being a sale transaction\n- The profit calculation matches the sale parameters\n\nThe inconsistencies are:\n1. The recorded_type is incorrect - should be \"Sale\" not \"Financial Expenses\"\n2. The recorded_amount is incorrect - should be 52739.99 not 56471.43\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Financial Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"52739.99\", \"Recorded amount\": \"56471.43\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240122051\"}}\n```",
