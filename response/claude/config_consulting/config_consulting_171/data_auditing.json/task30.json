The recorded_type is \"Sales Expenses\" but the invoice description and other fields indicate it's a \"Sale\" transaction.\n2. The unit price doesn't match what would be expected for the total amount:\n   - With recorded quantity of 1.0 and recorded price of 46570.66, the amount should be 46570.66, not 57430.63\n   - Based on the invoice description, the actual unit price should be 52961.46\n3. The tax amount (47736.9) is unusually high compared to the transaction amount and doesn't match the typical tax rate pattern seen in other transactions\n4. The total amount (57430.63) doesn't match what would be calculated from the unit price and quantity\n\nThe invoice text states: \"On January 07, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $52961.46, totaling $52961.46. The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $2648.07, leading to a total amount due of $50313.39.\"\n\nBased on this, the correct information should be:\n- Type: Sale (not Sales Expenses)\n- Unit price: 52961.46 (not 46570.66)\n- Total amount: 52961.46 (not 57430.63)\n- Tax amount: 2648.07 (not 47736.9)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '52961.46', 'Recorded price': '46570.66', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '52961.46', 'Recorded amount': '57430.63', 'Original tax': '2648.07', 'Recorded tax': '47736.9', 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240107012'} }\n```",
