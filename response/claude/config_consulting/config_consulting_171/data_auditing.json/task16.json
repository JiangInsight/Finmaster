The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n- But the recorded values show:\n  - recorded_amount: 413.5\n  - recorded_payment/receipt_status: Paid\n- This clearly shows a discrepancy between the invoice and the recorded fields.\n\nThe inconsistencies are:\n1. The amount should be $361.25 according to the invoice, but it's recorded as $413.50\n2. The payment status should be \"Unpaid\" according to the invoice, but it's recorded as \"Paid\"\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '361.25', 'Recorded amount': '413.5', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Interest20240122022'} }\n```",
