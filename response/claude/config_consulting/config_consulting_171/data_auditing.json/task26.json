The transaction type is recorded as \"Financial Expenses\", but the invoice and ID indicate this should be a \"Purchase\".\n2. The recorded date is \"2024-01-23\", but the invoice and ID indicate \"2023-12-31\".\n3. The recorded amount is $2,422.04, but based on the invoice, it should be $2,000.00 (calculated from 2.0 units at $1,000.00 per unit).\n\nThe invoice states: \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Purchase, consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $1000.00, totaling $2000.00. The payment_method of this transaction was bank transfer, and this transaction was paid. This transaction was prepared by Director, and the approver is Director. The supplier ID is S006, and the supplier name is Supplier 6.\"\n\nThis clearly indicates that the transaction category, date, and amount were incorrectly recorded.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Purchase', 'Recorded category': 'Financial Expenses', 'Original date': '2023-12-31', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-23', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '2000.00', 'Recorded amount': '2422.04', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Purchase20231231014'} }\n```",
