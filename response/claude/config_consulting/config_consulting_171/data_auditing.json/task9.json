First, I'll look for transactions where the recorded amount doesn't match the calculation from unit price Ã— quantity\n2. Check if tax amounts are correctly calculated (usually 5% in this dataset)\n3. Verify that profit calculations are correct (revenue - cost)\n4. Look for mismatches between invoice text and recorded fields\n5. Check if after-tax amounts are correctly calculated\n\nLooking at Sale20240108016, I notice a discrepancy:\n- The recorded tax amount is 3308.36\n- But based on the total amount of 2925.01, the tax should be 5% of this, which is approximately 146.25\n- The invoice confirms this, stating \"with a tax amount of $146.25\"\n\nThis is a significant discrepancy where the recorded tax amount is much higher than it should be.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": \"146.25\", \"Recorded tax\": \"3308.36\", \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240108016\"}}\n```",
