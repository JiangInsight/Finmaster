The payment_method of this transaction was bank transfer, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- However, in the recorded fields, we see:\n  1. \"recorded_quantity\" is listed as 2.0 instead of 3.0\n  2. \"recorded_payment/receipt_status\" is listed as \"Unpaid\" instead of \"Paid\"\n  3. The recorded_amount should be $15,000 (3 units Ã— $5,000) but is $10,000\n\nThis indicates clear inconsistencies between the invoice details and the recorded information.\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Original quantity\": \"3.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"2.0\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Original amount\": \"15000.0\", \"Recorded amount\": \"10000.0\", \"id\": \"Purchase20231231023\"}}",
