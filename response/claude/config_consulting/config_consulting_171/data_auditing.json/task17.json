The transaction is recorded with a type of \"Depreciation\" but the invoice description clearly states it's a \"Sale\" transaction.\n2. The receive_method is recorded as \"Interest receivable\" but the invoice indicates it should be \"account receviable\".\n\nThis is evident when comparing:\n- The recorded_type field shows \"Depreciation\"\n- The invoice text starts with \"On February 05, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale\"\n- The recorded_receive_method shows \"Interest receivable\"\n- The invoice indicates it should be \"account receviable\"\n\nThe transaction details like unit price, quantity, tax amount and cost amount are consistent with a sale transaction, not a depreciation entry.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Depreciation', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Interest receivable', 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240205077'} }\n```",
