Checking for duplicate IDs with inconsistent information:\n   - Initial20231231001 appears three times with different types and amounts, but these appear to be different components of the initial balance.\n\n2. Checking for transactions where recorded information contradicts the invoice:\n   - Looking at Sale20240121047, I notice the recorded_type is \"Purchase\" but the invoice clearly states it's a \"Sale\".\n\n3. Checking numerical calculations:\n   - For the Sale20240121047 transaction, the unit price × quantity (53934.4 × 1) matches the total amount, and other calculations seem consistent.\n\n4. Checking transaction details:\n   - The invoice description confirms this is a Sale transaction: \"On January 21, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $53934.40, totaling $53934.40.\"\n   - The transaction has all the typical sale fields populated (product, customer, tax amount, profit, etc.)\n\nThis is a clear case where the recorded_type field (Purchase) doesn't match what the transaction actually is based on the invoice and other fields (Sale). Since the invoice is considered more reliable due to its standardized nature, the recorded_type should be \"Sale\" instead of \"Purchase\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Purchase', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240121047'} }\n```",
