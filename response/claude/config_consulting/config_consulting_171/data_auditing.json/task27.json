The transaction type is recorded as \"Financial Expenses\" but the ID prefix \"Sale\" and other information in the invoice indicate it should be a \"Sale\" transaction.\n\n2. The recorded amount is $52,036.67, but when I check the invoice description, it states a total of $44,442.71 (unit price Ã— quantity).\n\n3. The recorded unit price ($44,525.93) doesn't match what's in the invoice description ($44,442.71).\n\nThe invoice is our most reliable source for verification, as mentioned in the task description. According to the invoice: \"On February 02, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $44442.71, totaling $44442.71.\"\n\nThis clearly indicates that:\n- The correct transaction type is \"Sale\" (not \"Financial Expenses\")\n- The correct amount is $44,442.71 (not $52,036.67)\n- The correct unit price is $44,442.71 (not $44,525.93)\n\nBased on these findings:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Financial Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '44442.71', 'Recorded price': '44525.93', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '44442.71', 'Recorded amount': '52036.67', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240202074'} }\n```",
