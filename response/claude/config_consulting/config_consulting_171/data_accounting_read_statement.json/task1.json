This typically includes \"Cash on Hand\" and may include \"Bank Deposits\" since these are typically liquid assets available for immediate use.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet:\n\n1. \"Cash on Hand\" shows:\n   - Initial amount: 3,000,000.00 on 2023-12-31\n   - End amount: 4,058,544.03 on 2024-02-05\n\n2. \"Bank Deposits\" shows:\n   - Initial amount: 5,000,000.00 on 2023-12-31\n   - End amount: 3,079,000.00 on 2024-02-05\n\nBased on the example provided, it appears that only \"Cash on Hand\" is considered as the cash available for day-to-day operations, not including bank deposits.\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '3000000.00', 'end value': '4058544.03'}}\n```",
