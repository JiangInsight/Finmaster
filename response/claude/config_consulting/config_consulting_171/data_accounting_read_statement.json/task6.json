These are typically the tangible items held for operational use in a business.\n\nFrom the balance sheet provided:\n- The initial value of Fixed Assets is 5000000.00 as of 2023-12-31\n- The end value of Fixed Assets is 5000000.00 as of 2024-02-05\n\nNote that there's also \"Accumulated Depreciation\" which represents the cumulative depreciation of these fixed assets, but the question asks specifically for the value of the tangible items themselves, not their net book value after depreciation.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5000000.00'}}\n```",
