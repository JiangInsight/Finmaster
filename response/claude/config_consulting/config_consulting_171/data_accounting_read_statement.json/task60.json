The income earned by an entity from financial assets\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\n### Balance Sheet\nLooking at the balance sheet, \"Bank Deposits\" represents funds deposited into a bank. The end amount is 3,079,000.00.\n\n### Income Statement\nIn the income statement, \"Interest Income\" represents income earned from financial assets. The amount is 13,279.60.\n\n### Cash Flow Statement\nI don't see any other relevant line items in the cash flow statement that represent either bank deposits or income from financial assets.\n\nTherefore, the two specific line items and their values are:\n1. Bank Deposits (from Balance Sheet): 3,079,000.00\n2. Interest Income (from Income Statement): 13,279.60\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3079000.00', 'value2': '13279.60'}}\n```",
