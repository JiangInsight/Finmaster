First, I need to find the amount of \"interest accrued but not yet received\"\n   - Looking at the Balance Sheet, I see \"Interest Receivable\" with an end amount of 13279.60\n   - This represents interest that has accrued but hasn't been received yet\n\n2. Next, I need to find the \"net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\"\n   - Looking at the Cash Flow Statement, I see \"Net Increase\" with a value of -862455.97\n   - This shows the net change in cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nTherefore, the two values I need to extract are:\n1. Interest accrued but not yet received: 13279.60\n2. Net addition in cash and cash equivalents: -862455.97\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13279.60', 'value2': '-862455.97'} }\n```",
