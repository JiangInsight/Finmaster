This would typically be represented by the Accounts Payable line item.\n\nIn the balance sheet:\n- Accounts Payable increased from $0.00 (2023-12-31) to $381,000.00 (2024-02-05)\n\nIn the cash flow statement:\n- There's a line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with a value of $381,000.00\n\nThis indicates that during the period, the entity incurred $381,000.00 of obligations for goods or services purchased on credit. Since the initial amount was $0.00, the entire $381,000.00 represents the addition in the amount owed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $381,000.00.\n\n{\"solution\": {'value': '381000.00'} }",
