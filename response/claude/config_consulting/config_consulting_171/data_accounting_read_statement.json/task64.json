The profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense (Profit Before Tax)\n2. The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit (Accounts Payable)\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares (Paid-in Capital)\n\nLet me examine each financial statement:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- Accounts Payable: 381000.00\n- Paid-in Capital: 13000000.00\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- Profit Before Tax: 2147390.30\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- I can confirm the Accounts Payable increase: 381000.00\n\nNow I'll group these by financial statement in the correct order and extract the values:\n\n1. Balance Sheet: Paid-in Capital = 13000000.00, Accounts Payable = 381000.00\n2. Income Statement: Profit Before Tax = 2147390.30\n3. Cash Flow Statement: (Already confirmed the values)\n\nTherefore, the three values I need to extract are:\n- value1 (Paid-in Capital): 13000000.00\n- value2 (Profit Before Tax): 2147390.30\n- value3 (Accounts Payable): 381000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '2147390.30', 'value3': '381000.00'} }\n```",
