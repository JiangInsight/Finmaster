In the balance sheet, I can see \"Interest Receivable\" which represents interest that has been earned but not yet received:\n   - Initial amount (2023-12-31): 0.00\n   - End amount (2024-02-05): 13,279.60\n\n2. This is confirmed in the cash flow statement which shows \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" of -13,279.60, indicating an increase in interest receivable.\n\n3. The income statement also shows \"Interest Income\" of 13,279.60, which matches the interest receivable amount.\n\nThe \"Interest Receivable\" is exactly what we're looking for - it represents interest that has accrued but has not yet been received.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '13279.60'} }\n```",
