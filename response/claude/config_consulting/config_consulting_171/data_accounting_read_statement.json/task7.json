The task asks me to identify expense items specifically.\n\nIn a balance sheet, depreciation expense would typically appear as \"Accumulated Depreciation\" which is a contra-asset account. This represents the cumulative depreciation expense that has reduced the value of fixed assets over time.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Accumulated Depreciation had an initial value of 0.00 on 2023-12-31\n- Accumulated Depreciation had an end value of 91505.05 on 2024-02-05\n\nThis accumulated depreciation represents an expense that has been recognized in the profit and loss statement.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '91505.05'}}\n```",
