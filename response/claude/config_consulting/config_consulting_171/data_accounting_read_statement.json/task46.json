This section shows:\n\n1. \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an amount of 0.00\n2. \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with an amount of -0.00\n\nThe net cash flow from investing activities represents the amount of cash generated from (or used in) acquiring and disposing of long-term assets and other investments. In this case, the value is -0.00, which means there was technically a very small cash outflow rounded to zero.\n\nThe only component sub-item listed is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of 0.00.\n\nTherefore:\n- The value of net cash flow from investing activities is -0.00\n- The sub-item value (Purchase of Fixed Assets) is 0.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '0.00'}}}\n```",
