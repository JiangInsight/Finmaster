In the balance sheet, there's a line item \"Taxes Payable\" with an End_amount of 243988.48 as of 2024-02-05\n2. In the cash flow statement, there's \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an Amount of 243988.48\n3. In the income statement, there's \"Tax Expense\" with an Amount of 243988.48\n\nAccording to accounting principles, the tax expense line in the income statement represents the total amount of tax an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period. This is the most direct measure of the tax obligation for the period.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 243988.48, which is found in the income statement as \"Tax Expense\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '243988.48'} }\n```",
