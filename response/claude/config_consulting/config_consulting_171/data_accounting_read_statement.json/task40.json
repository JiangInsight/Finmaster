This represents purchases made on credit.\n\nIn the provided cash flow statement, I can see:\n- \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with a value of 381000.00\n\nSince this value is positive, it indicates an increase in accounts payable, which means an addition to the amount owed by the entity for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\nTherefore, the value I need to extract is 381000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '381000.00'}}\n```",
