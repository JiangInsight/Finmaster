Accounts receivable represents money owed to a company by customers who purchased goods or services on credit.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement provided, I can see:\n`(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -2984071.72 | 2024-02-05`\n\nThe negative value (-2984071.72) indicates an increase in accounts receivable (since it's labeled \"(Increase) Decrease\"). This means more money is owed to the entity, which represents a use of cash in the operating activities.\n\nSince the question asks for the value of the decrease, I need to report this figure.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2984071.72'}}\n```",
