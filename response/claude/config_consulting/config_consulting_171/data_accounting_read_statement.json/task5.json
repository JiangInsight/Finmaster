I need to find the line item that represents goods or materials held for sale, in production, or in the process of being manufactured.\n\n2. In the balance sheet, I can see a line item called \"Inventory\" which is exactly what we're looking for - this represents goods held for sale in the ordinary course of business.\n\n3. The initial value of Inventory as of 2023-12-31 is 0.00\n   The end value of Inventory as of 2024-02-05 is 485000.00\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '485000.00'}}\n```",
