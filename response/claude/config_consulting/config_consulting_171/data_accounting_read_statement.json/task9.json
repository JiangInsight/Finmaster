This would typically be shown as \"Taxes Payable\" or a similar line item in the liabilities section.\n\nIn the provided balance sheet, I can see a line item called \"Taxes Payable\" which represents exactly what I'm looking for - taxes that have been recognized as an expense but not yet paid to the tax authorities.\n\nThe values for this line item are:\n- Initial amount (as of 2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End amount (as of 2024-02-05): 243988.48\n\nTherefore, the taxes accrued but not yet paid had an initial value of 0.00 and an end value of 243988.48.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '243988.48'}}\n```",
