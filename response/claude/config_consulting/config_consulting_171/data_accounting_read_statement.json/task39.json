                        "content": "I need to identify the specific line item that represents a reduction in assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, which typically refers to inventory.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement, I can see the line \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with a value of \"-485000.00\". \n\nIn a cash flow statement:\n- A negative value for \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" indicates an increase in inventory (cash outflow)\n- A positive value would indicate a decrease in inventory (cash inflow)\n\nSince the value is negative (-485000.00), this represents an increase in inventory rather than a reduction. In other words, the company spent $485,000 to increase its inventory during this period.\n\nHowever, the task is asking for the \"reduction in the amount of assets held for sale\", and in this case, there is no reduction - only an increase. Since there is no reduction, the answer would be 0.\n\nBut looking at the example, I see that the solution provided for a similar situation (where inventory increased by 5,090,000) was to report the negative value itself. This suggests that the task is asking for the line item value that represents the change in inventory, even if it's an increase.\n\nFollowing the example's approach, the answer would be the value shown on the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" line.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-485000.00'}}\n```",
