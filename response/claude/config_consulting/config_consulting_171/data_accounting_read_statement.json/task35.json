                        "content": "I need to identify four specific line items from the income statement:\n\n1. Costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services to customers = Selling Expenses\n2. Financing costs incurred to raise funds for production and operation = Financial Expenses\n3. Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life = Depreciation\n4. Total amount of taxes expected to pay/recover during a reporting period = Tax Expense\n\nLooking at the income statement provided:\n- Selling Expenses = 274260.07\n- Depreciation = 91505.05\n- Financial Expenses = 67135.35\n- Tax Expense = 243988.48\n\nFollowing the original line item order in the statement, I'll arrange my answer accordingly.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '274260.07', 'value2': '67135.35', 'value3': '91505.05', 'value4': '243988.48'}}\n```\n\nWait, I need to double-check the ordering. In the original statement, the order is:\n- Selling Expenses (274260.07)\n- Depreciation (91505.05)\n- Financial Expenses (67135.35)\n- Tax Expense (243988.48)\n\nSo the correct order is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '274260.07', 'value2': '91505.05', 'value3': '67135.35', 'value4': '243988.48'}}\n```",
