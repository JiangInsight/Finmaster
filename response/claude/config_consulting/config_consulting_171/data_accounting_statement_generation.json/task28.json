January 2, 2024: 12,921.28 (Expense20240102001)\n2. January 3, 2024: 8,194.45 (Expense20240103001)\n3. January 5, 2024: 18,876.84 (Expense20240105001)\n4. January 5, 2024: 11,420.55 (Expense20240105001)\n5. January 7, 2024: 8,874.38 (Expense20240107001)\n6. January 7, 2024: 2,053.82 (Expense20240107001)\n7. January 8, 2024: 4,130.98 (Expense20240108001)\n8. January 9, 2024: 3,841.38 (Expense20240109001)\n9. January 10, 2024: 16,969.96 (Expense20240110001)\n10. January 12, 2024: 8,530.53 (Expense20240112001)\n11. January 13, 2024: 2,222.23 (Expense20240113001)\n12. January 15, 2024: 7,816.16 (Expense20240115001)\n13. January 15, 2024: 19,492.57 (Expense20240115001)\n14. January 16, 2024: 12,763.28 (Expense20240116001)\n15. January 17, 2024: 17,037.30 (Expense20240117001)\n16. January 17, 2024: 14,666.28 (Expense20240117001)\n17. January 18, 2024: 11,902.29 (Expense20240118001)\n18. January 20, 2024: 15,500.46 (Expense20240120001)\n19. January 22, 2024: 18,535.65 (Expense20240122001)\n20. January 23, 2024: 4,983.09 (Expense20240123001)\n21. January 24, 2024: 7,878.37 (Expense20240124001)\n22. January 26, 2024: 8,867.89 (Expense20240126001)\n23. January 28, 2024: 15,831.33 (Expense20240128001)\n24. January 30, 2024: 4,564.06 (Expense20240130001)\n25. January 30, 2024: 2,198.15 (Expense20240130001)\n26. January 31, 2024: 14,186.79 (Expense20240131001)\n\nNow I'll add up all these amounts:\n12,921.28 + 8,194.45 + 18,876.84 + 11,420.55 + 8,874.38 + 2,053.82 + 4,130.98 + 3,841.38 + 16,969.96 + 8,530.53 + 2,222.23 + 7,816.16 + 19,492.57 + 12,763.28 + 17,037.30 + 14,666.28 + 11,902.29 + 15,500.46 + 18,535.65 + 4,983.09 + 7,878.37 + 8,867.89 + 15,831.33 + 4,564.06 + 2,198.15 + 14,186.79 = 274,260.07\n\nTherefore, the total sales expenses for the given period is $274,260.07.\n\nHowever, I notice that this doesn't match expected totals in typical accounting scenarios. Let me double-check by verifying if there are any other sales expense transactions that might have different formatting or categorization.\n\nAfter reviewing, I believe I have captured all the sales expenses from the given data. The total amount of sales expenses is $274,260.07.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Selling Expenses': '274260.07'} }",
