From the data, I need to identify the initial cash and bank balances.\n\nLooking at the transaction data, I can see there are initial deposits recorded on 2023-12-31:\n\n1. Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | 3000000.0\n2. Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0\n\nThese entries represent the beginning balances of cash and bank accounts respectively. The beginning cash and cash equivalents would be the sum of these two amounts:\n\nCash deposit: 3,000,000.00\nBank deposit: 5,000,000.00\nTotal beginning balance: 8,000,000.00\n\nThis amount represents the total cash and cash equivalents available at the start of the reporting period (December 31, 2023), which will be shown as the beginning balance in the cash flow statement.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
