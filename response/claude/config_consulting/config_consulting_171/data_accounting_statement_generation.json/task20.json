                        "content": "I'll solve this task by parsing the transactions and creating a balance sheet. Let me work through this step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the initial values\nFrom the transactions, I can identify the initial values on 2023-12-31:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00 \n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00\n\n## Step 2: Track changes to Cash on Hand\nLet me calculate the ending cash balance by analyzing cash inflows and outflows:\n\nInitial cash: 3,000,000.00\nCash transactions affecting the balance:\n- Cash outflows: Expenses paid in cash, purchases paid in cash\n- Cash inflows: Sales paid in cash\n\n## Step 3: Track changes to Bank Deposits\nStarting bank balance: 5,000,000.00\nBank transactions affecting the balance:\n- Bank outflows: Purchases paid via bank transfer\n- Bank inflows: None specified\n\n## Step 4: Track Interest Receivable\nInterest receivables accumulate through the \"Interest Receivables\" transactions.\n\n## Step 5: Track Accounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable increases when sales are made with \"Account Receivable\" as the receive method.\n\n## Step 6: Track Inventory\nInitial inventory: 0.00\nThe inventory is affected by purchases of different products (S001, S002, S003, S004) and reduced by sales.\n\n## Step 7: Track Fixed Assets and Depreciation\nInitial fixed assets: 5,000,000.00\nDepreciation is tracked through \"Depreciation\" transaction types.\n\n## Step 8: Track Accounts Payable\nAccounts payable increases when purchases use \"Account Payable\" as the payment method.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate Taxes Payable\nTaxes payable accumulates from the tax_amount in sales transactions.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate Paid-in Capital and Retained Earnings\nInitial paid-in capital is the sum of initial deposits: 13,000,000.00\nRetained earnings change based on profit/loss from operations.\n\nNow, let's compile all these calculations:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\",\n    \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Total Assets Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Total Owner's Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"2169353.29\",\n    \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"2845000.00\",\n    \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"10982.97\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"2427142.54\",\n    \"Inventory End Value\": \"1015000.00\",\n    \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"8467478.80\",\n    \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"91505.05\",\n    \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"4908494.95\",\n    \"Total Assets End Value\": \"13375973.75\",\n    \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"381000.00\",\n    \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"184830.17\",\n    \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"565830.17\",\n    \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"-189856.42\",\n    \"Total Owner's Equity End Value\": \"12810143.58\",\n    \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity End Value\": \"13375973.75\"\n}}\n```",
