Looking through the data, I don't see any entries with type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar.\n\n## Step 3: Identify depreciation expenses\n\nI can see there are two depreciation entries:\n```\nDepreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45754.63999999999 | 45754.63999999999\nDepreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | 2024-02-01 | 2024-02-01 | 45750.41 | 45750.41\n```\n\nTotal depreciation: 45,754.64 + 45,750.41 = 91,505.05\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final amount\n\nThe formula for calculating the final amount of non-current assets is:\nInitial value + New purchases - Disposals - Depreciation\n\nSince there are no clearly identified fixed asset purchases or disposals in the data, the calculation is:\n5,000,000.00 - 91,505.05 = 4,908,494.95\n\n## Final Answer:\nBased on my analysis, the non-current assets values are:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '4908494.95'} }",
