Looking at the transactions in the problem to solve, I don't see a \"FixedAsset\" transaction like in the example. Let me re-examine the data carefully.\n\nAfter reviewing the current problem data, I don't see any explicit fixed asset purchase transactions or other investing activities in the dataset provided. The transactions appear to be primarily related to:\n- Initial deposits\n- Operating expenses\n- Sales\n- Purchases of inventory/services\n- Interest receivables\n\nSince there are no investing activities identified in the current problem, the net cash flow from investing activities would be zero.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '0'} }\n```",
