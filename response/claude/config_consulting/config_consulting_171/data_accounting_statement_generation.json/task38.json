All the sales transactions marked as \"Account Receivable\" are shown as \"Unpaid.\"\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the change in accounts receivable\nSince we started with 0 accounts receivable and added 2,786,071.72 with no evidence of collections, the net increase in accounts receivable is 2,786,071.72.\n\nIn the cash flow statement, this would be reported as a negative number (since it represents cash that was earned but not received):\n(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable: -2,786,071.72\n\nHowever, I noticed this number is different from the expected answer in the example. Let me double-check if there are any transactions I missed or any other factors to consider.\n\nLooking at the format of the transaction data more carefully, I need to ensure I'm capturing all relevant information. On second review, I don't see any transactions that would reduce the accounts receivable balance, and I've counted all sales with the \"Account Receivable\" receive_method.\n\nAfter final verification, the increase in accounts receivable is 2,786,071.72, which translates to -2,786,071.72 in the cash flow statement (showing the negative impact on cash).\n\nI'll round this to two decimal places for the final answer.\n\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-2786071.72'}}",
