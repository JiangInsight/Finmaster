Looking for the initial fixed assets value:\nIn the transaction data, I can see there's an \"Initial20231231001\" entry with type \"Fixed Assets\" on 2023-12-31 with an amount of 5,000,000.0.\n\n2. Looking for any changes to fixed assets:\nI need to identify any purchases, disposals, or other transactions that affected fixed assets during the period.\n\nThe only other fixed asset transaction I can see is \"FixedAsset\" type transactions. In this dataset, there aren't any explicit fixed asset disposals.\n\nFrom scanning the transactions, I found only one additional fixed asset transaction:\n- No additional fixed asset transactions are explicitly labeled as such in this data.\n- However, it's possible there could be other transactions affecting fixed assets.\n\nLooking more carefully at all the transaction types, I can see there aren't any transactions labeled with a type like \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar that would indicate additional fixed assets acquisitions.\n\nGiven the initial value is clearly 5,000,000.00, the end value would be the same unless there were any additions or disposals.\n\nReading through the transaction details more carefully, I notice there is a transaction with a type \"FixedAsset20231231001\" with type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" that has an amount of 305,354.43.\n\nSince I don't see any fixed asset disposals, the ending value would be:\nInitial value (5,000,000.00) + Fixed asset purchases (305,354.43) = 5,305,354.43\n\nTherefore:\n- Fixed Assets Initial Value: 5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets End Value: 5,305,354.43\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Fixed Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Fixed Assets End Value': '5305354.43'}}\n```",
