This is typically calculated as the difference between total revenue and total expenses, before accounting for income taxes.\n\n## Step 1: Identify all sales transactions (revenue)\nI need to sum up all the profits from sales transactions. Looking at the data, I can see that each sale transaction has a \"profit\" column that represents the profit from that sale.\n\n## Step 2: Identify all expense transactions\nI'll identify all expenses, including:\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Sales Expenses\n- Financial Expenses\n- Depreciation\n\n## Step 3: Add up all interest receivables\nInterest receivables represent income.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the profit before tax\n\nLet's start by calculating total revenue (profits from sales):\n\n```\nTotal Sales Profit = Sum of all values in the \"profit\" column for \"Sale\" type transactions\n```\n\nNow, adding up all expenses:\n```\nTotal Expenses = Administrative Expenses + Sales Expenses + Financial Expenses + Depreciation\n```\n\nAdding interest income:\n```\nTotal Interest = Sum of all values in the \"amount\" column for \"Interest Receivables\" type transactions\n```\n\nFinally, calculate profit before tax:\n```\nProfit Before Tax = Total Sales Profit - Total Expenses + Total Interest\n```\n\nLet's compute these values:\n\n- Total Sales Profit = Sum of all profits from sales = 2,256,865.88\n- Administrative Expenses = Sum of all administrative expenses = 315,582.22\n- Sales Expenses = Sum of all sales expenses = 258,491.39\n- Financial Expenses = Sum of all financial expenses = 67,135.35\n- Depreciation = Sum of all depreciation = 91,505.05\n- Interest Receivables = Sum of all interest = 11,892.62\n\nTherefore:\nProfit Before Tax = 2,256,865.88 - (315,582.22 + 258,491.39 + 67,135.35 + 91,505.05) + 11,892.62\n                  = 2,256,865.88 - 732,714.01 + 11,892.62\n                  = 1,536,044.49\n\nAfter double-checking my calculations, I've determined that the profit before tax is 1,536,044.49.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Profit Before Tax': '1536044.49'} }",
