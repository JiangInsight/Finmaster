This involves identifying and summing all cash and bank-related transactions.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the initial cash and bank deposits:\n- Initial cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n- Initial bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n\nThen I'll track all cash inflows and outflows:\n\n1.

Let me verify my calculation...\n\nActually, I see I made an error. I need to look more carefully at the payment methods. Not all purchases were paid in cash or bank transfers, and I need to consider only those that affected cash and bank balances.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nInitial cash and bank balance: 8,000,000.00\n\nCash outflows (expenses paid in cash): 624,186.84\nBank outflows (purchases paid by bank transfer): 2,042,000.00\nCash payments for purchases: 101,000.00\n\nCash inflows from sales (paid in cash): 1,659,292.71\n\nFinal cash and bank balance: 8,000,000.00 - 624,186.84 - 2,042,000.00 - 101,000.00 + 1,659,292.71 = 6,892,105.87\n\nHowever, there's another factor to consider - the depreciation entries. These don't affect cash but are recorded in the statement:\n- Depreciation20240101001: 45,754.64\n- Depreciation20240201002: 45,750.41\n\nSince depreciation doesn't affect cash, I won't include these in my calculation.\n\nThe final cash and cash equivalents balance is 6,892,105.87.\n\nWait, I need to carefully check my additions once more...\n\nAfter carefully reviewing the data, the correct calculation is:\nStarting balance: 8,000,000.00\nCash outflows: 624,186.84 + 101,000.00 = 725,186.84\nBank outflows: 2,042,000.00\nCash inflows: 1,659,292.71\n\nFinal balance: 8,000,000.00 - 725,186.84 - 2,042,000.00 + 1,659,292.71 = 6,892,105.87\n\nLet me double-check this...\n\nActually, after careful review, I determine that the final cash and cash equivalents balance is:\n\nInitial: 8,000,000.00\nCash outflows: 725,186.84\nBank outflows: 2,042,000.00\nCash inflows: 1,659,292.71\n\nFinal balance: 8,000,000.00 - 725,186.84 - 2,042,000.00 + 1,659,292.71 = 6,892,105.87\n\nSo the final ending cash and cash equivalents balance is $6,892,105.87.\n\nActually I notice that there are 434,651.47 in the previous example. Let me recheck my approach.\n\nI need to calculate based on initial cash plus all cash movements. Let me do a precise calculation:\n\nInitial Cash: 3,000,000.00\nInitial Bank: 5,000,000.00\n\nCash inflows (sales with cash payment method): 1,659,292.71\nCash outflows (expenses and purchases paid in cash): 725,186.84\n\nBank inflows: 0\nBank outflows (purchases paid by bank transfer): 2,042,000.00\n\nNo transfers between cash and bank are observed.\n\nFinal Cash: 3,000,000.00 + 1,659,292.71 - 725,186.84 = 3,934,105.87\nFinal Bank: 5,000,000.00 - 2,042,000.00 = 2,958,000.00\n\nTotal Cash and Cash Equivalents: 3,934,105.87 + 2,958,000.00 = 6,892,105.87\n\nI've verified this calculation and believe it to be accurate, with a final balance of $6,892,105.87.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Ending Balance': '6892105.87'} }",
