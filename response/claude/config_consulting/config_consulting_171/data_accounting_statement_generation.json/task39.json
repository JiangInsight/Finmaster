                        "content": "I need to calculate the final interest receivable item in the cash flow statement, which represents the change in interest receivable during the period.\n\nTo do this, I'll track all the \"Interest Receivables\" transactions and determine the net change from the beginning to the end of the period.\n\n## Step 1: Identify all Interest Receivable transactions\nLooking at the data, I need to extract all rows with \"type\" equal to \"Interest Receivables\".\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the cumulative interest receivable at the beginning and end of the period\nI'll find the first and last interest receivable entries to see the beginning and ending balances.\n\nFrom the data:\n- First entry (Jan 1, 2024): 443.22\n- Last entry (Feb 5, 2024): 274.03\n\nHowever, this approach isn't accurate because these values don't represent the cumulative balance. Instead, they represent individual entries.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total interest receivable \nThe proper way to determine the change is to sum up all interest receivable entries to find the net change over the period.\n\nLet me add up all the interest receivable amounts:\n- Jan 1: 443.22\n- Jan 2: 443.22\n- Jan 3: 441.44\n- Jan 4: 439.66\n- Jan 5: 416.52\n- Jan 6: 416.52\n- Jan 7: 389.73\n- Jan 8: 388.84\n- Jan 9: 388.84\n- Jan 10: 383.23\n- Jan 11: 383.23\n- Jan 12: 383.06\n- Jan 13: 380.83\n- Jan 14: 371.93\n- Jan 15: 371.93\n- Jan 16: 371.93\n- Jan 17: 363.03\n- Jan 18: 363.03\n- Jan 19: 363.03\n- Jan 20: 363.03\n- Jan 21: 361.25\n- Jan 22: 361.25\n- Jan 23: 361.25\n- Jan 24: 359.92\n- Jan 25: 359.92\n- Jan 26: 359.92\n- Jan 27: 359.92\n- Jan 28: 351.02\n- Jan 29: 351.02\n- Jan 30: 351.02\n- Jan 31: 324.32\n- Feb 1: 318.53\n- Feb 2: 318.53\n- Feb 3: 300.73\n- Feb 4: 300.73\n- Feb 5: 274.03\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the net change in interest receivable\nThe total interest receivable at the beginning of the period was 0 (assuming no interest receivable before Jan 1).\nThe accumulated interest receivable at the end is the sum of all entries = 12,681.64.\n\nHowever, I need to look at this differently. Each entry represents the interest accrued on that day, not the cumulative balance. The change in interest receivable for a cash flow statement is the difference between interest accrued at the end of the period and the beginning.\n\nSince we're looking at the first entry on Jan 1 (443.22) and the last entry on Feb 5 (274.03), the difference is 443.22 - 274.03 = 169.19.\n\nBut this still doesn't seem right for a cash flow statement analysis.\n\nLet me reconsider:\n- For a cash flow statement, we need to determine how much the interest receivable account balance has changed.\n- This would be the increase or decrease in the total amount of interest that has been earned but not yet received.\n\nThe proper approach is to sum all interest receivable entries, which represents the total new interest accrued in the period (12,681.64). Any interest received would have reduced this balance.\n\nSince these entries represent interest that has accrued but not been paid (they're all marked as \"Unpaid\"), and there's no indication of any interest being received during the period, the full 12,681.64 represents an increase in interest receivable.\n\nFor a cash flow statement, this would be shown as a negative number (because an increase in a receivable uses cash). Therefore:\n\n(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable = -12,681.64\n\nActually, I need to be more precise. Let me carefully examine what each entry means. Based on general accounting principles, the interest receivable entries likely represent the interest earned/accrued on that particular day, not the cumulative balance.\n\nTo properly calculate the change in interest receivable, I need to determine:\n1. The interest receivable balance at the beginning of the period (Jan 1)\n2. The interest receivable balance at the end of the period (Feb 5)\n3. Subtract the beginning balance from the ending balance\n\nSince there's no explicit beginning balance given, it's likely zero. The ending balance would be the sum of all interest receivable entries since they're all unpaid. This gives us an increase of 12,681.64.\n\nHowever, looking more carefully at the data format, I notice the \"amount\" column already shows the daily interest receivable. So the proper approach is simply to look at the change from the beginning to the end of the period.\n\nI need to format my answer as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-12681.64'} }\n```\n\nWait - I need to reconsider once more. In a cash flow statement, \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" refers to the change in the account balance over the period. Since we're comparing amounts from January 1 to February 5, I should compare the beginning and ending balances.\n\nLooking at each entry as a daily accrual, with the account balance being the sum of all receivables not yet received, the beginning balance would be 443.22 (Jan 1) and the ending balance would be 12,681.64 (sum of all entries still outstanding on Feb 5).\n\nTherefore, the change would be 443.22 - 12,681.64 = -12,238.42.\n\nBut this approach still doesn't account for any potential collections of interest during the period. Let me check the data more carefully.\n\nOn further inspection, I notice a cleaner way to approach this. Each entry represents the interest accrued on that specific day. All entries are marked \"Unpaid,\" indicating none have been collected. The total increase in interest receivable over the period is thus the sum of all interest receivable entries: 12,681.64.\n\nFor the cash flow statement, since this is an increase in a receivable (a use of cash), it would be shown as a negative number: -12,681.64.\n\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-12681.64'} }",
