                        "content": "I'll solve this problem step by step by calculating each of the requested ratios.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nThis ratio measures the relationship between operating cash flows and net income.\n\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Net Income\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -862,455.97\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = 1,903,401.82\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = -862,455.97 / 1,903,401.82 = -0.453\n\n## 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio (also called Turnover Ratio)\n\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate revenue.\n\nFormula: Total Revenue / Average Current Assets\n\n- Total Revenue = 4,879,769.51\n- Initial Current Assets = 8,000,000.00\n- End Current Assets = 10,619,895.35\n- Average Current Assets = (8,000,000.00 + 10,619,895.35) / 2 = 9,309,947.68\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = 4,879,769.51 / 9,309,947.68 = 0.524\n\n## 3. Quick Ratio\n\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n\nFormula: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\n- Current Assets = 10,619,895.35\n- Inventory = 485,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 624,988.48\n\nQuick Ratio = (10,619,895.35 - 485,000.00) / 624,988.48 = 10,134,895.35 / 624,988.48 = 16.22\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.45', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.52', 'Quick Ratio': '16.22'} }\n```",
