Let me work through this step by step.\n\nThe formula for Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is:\nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nStep 1: Find Net Credit Sales\nFrom the income statement, I can see that:\n- Main Business Revenue (Net Sales) = $4,879,769.51\n\nStep 2: Calculate Average Accounts Receivable\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable (2023-12-31) = $0.00\n- Ending Accounts Receivable (2024-02-05) = $2,984,071.72\n- Average Accounts Receivable = ($0.00 + $2,984,071.72) / 2 = $1,492,035.86\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $4,879,769.51 / $1,492,035.86 = 3.27\n\nLet me round to 2 decimal places:\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 3.27\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.27'} }\n```",
