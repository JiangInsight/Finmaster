From the cash flow statement:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -862,455.97\n\n2. From the balance sheet:\n   - Total Current Liabilities (End amount) = 624,988.48\n\nNow I'll calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -862,455.97 / 624,988.48\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -1.38\n\nLet me round this to two decimal places: -1.38\n\nTherefore, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is -1.38.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.38'} }\n```",
