                        "content": "I'll calculate each of these financial ratios step by step using the provided financial statements.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis ratio measures the company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with cash generated from operations.\n- Operating Cash Flow = -862,455.97\n- Current Liabilities = 624,988.48\n- Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities = -862,455.97 / 624,988.48 = -1.38\n\n## 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio measures the company's financial leverage.\n- Total Liabilities = 624,988.48\n- Total Equity = 14,903,401.82\n- Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Equity = 624,988.48 / 14,903,401.82 = 0.04\n\n## 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company is using its assets to generate sales.\n- Revenue = 4,879,769.51\n- Total Assets = 15,528,390.30\n- Ratio = Revenue / Total Assets = 4,879,769.51 / 15,528,390.30 = 0.31\n\n## 4. Quick Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n- Quick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 10,619,895.35 - 485,000.00 = 10,134,895.35\n- Current Liabilities = 624,988.48\n- Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities = 10,134,895.35 / 624,988.48 = 16.22\n\n## 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n- Ratio = -1.38\n\n## 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\nThis ratio measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholders' equity.\n- Net Income = 1,903,401.82\n- Shareholders' Equity = 14,903,401.82\n- ROE = Net Income / Shareholders' Equity = 1,903,401.82 / 14,903,401.82 = 0.1277 = 12.77%\n\n## 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company is collecting revenue and using its assets.\n- Revenue = 4,879,769.51\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 2,984,071.72) / 2 = 1,492,035.86\n- Ratio = Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable = 4,879,769.51 / 1,492,035.86 = 3.27\n\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.38', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.04', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.31', 'Quick Ratio': '16.22', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.38', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '12.77%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.27'} }",
