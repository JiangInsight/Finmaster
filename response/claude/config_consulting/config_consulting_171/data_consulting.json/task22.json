The formula is:\n\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = $10,619,895.35\n- Inventory = $485,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = $624,988.48\n\nQuick Ratio = ($10,619,895.35 - $485,000.00) / $624,988.48\nQuick Ratio = $10,134,895.35 / $624,988.48\nQuick Ratio = 16.22\n\n## Net Profit Margin Calculation\n\nThe Net Profit Margin measures how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. The formula is:\n\nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = $1,903,401.82\n- Total Revenue = $4,879,769.51\n\nNet Profit Margin = ($1,903,401.82 / $4,879,769.51) × 100%\nNet Profit Margin = 0.3901 × 100%\nNet Profit Margin = 39.01%\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '16.22', 'Net Profit Margin': '39.01%'} }\n```",
