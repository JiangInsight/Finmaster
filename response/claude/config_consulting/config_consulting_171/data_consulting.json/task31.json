                        "content": "I need to calculate five financial ratios based on the provided financial statements. Let me work through each ratio step by step.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\nFormula: Net Sales (Revenue) / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nGiven:\n- Net Sales (Revenue) = $4,879,769.51\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable = $0\n- Ending Accounts Receivable = $2,984,071.72\n- Average Accounts Receivable = ($0 + $2,984,071.72) / 2 = $1,492,035.86\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $4,879,769.51 / $1,492,035.86 = 3.27\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay off short-term liabilities with cash generated from operations.\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nGiven:\n- Operating Cash Flow = -$862,455.97\n- Current Liabilities = $624,988.48\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$862,455.97 / $624,988.48 = -1.38\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -1.38\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\nFormula: Net Sales (Revenue) / Average Total Assets\n\nGiven:\n- Net Sales (Revenue) = $4,879,769.51\n- Beginning Total Assets = $13,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets = $15,528,390.30\n- Average Total Assets = ($13,000,000.00 + $15,528,390.30) / 2 = $14,264,195.15\n\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = $4,879,769.51 / $14,264,195.15 = 0.34\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's financial leverage.\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\nGiven:\n- Total Liabilities = $624,988.48 (since there are only current liabilities)\n- Total Equity = $14,903,401.82\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $624,988.48 / $14,903,401.82 = 0.04\n\nNow I'll format these results according to the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.27', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-1.38', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.38', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.34', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.04'} }\n```",
