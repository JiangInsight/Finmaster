FCF represents the cash a company generates after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and maintain capital assets.\n\nThe formula for FCF is:\nFCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures\n\nLet me identify these components from the given statement:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -862,455.97\n2. Capital Expenditures = Purchase of Fixed Assets = 0.00\n\nTherefore:\nFCF = -862,455.97 - 0.00 = -862,455.97\n\nI can verify this calculation by looking at the Net Increase in cash, which is also -862,455.97, confirming my calculation is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-862455.97'}}\n```",
