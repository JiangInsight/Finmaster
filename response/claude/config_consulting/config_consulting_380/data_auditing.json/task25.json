The cost amount for this transaction was $5000.00, with a tax amount of $729.14, leading to a total amount due of $13853.56. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\nComparing this with the recorded data in the table:\n1. The recorded_type is \"Purchase\" but the invoice clearly states it's a \"Sale\"\n2. The recorded_date is \"2024-02-09\" but the invoice says \"February 02, 2024\"\n3. The recorded_unit_price is \"13599.45\" but the invoice states \"$14582.70\"\n\nThese inconsistencies suggest errors in the recorded data. The invoice is generally considered more reliable as a source of truth due to its standardized and regulated nature.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Purchase\", \"Original date\": \"2024-02-02\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-02-09\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"14582.70\", \"Recorded price\": \"13599.45\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240202065\"}}\n```",
