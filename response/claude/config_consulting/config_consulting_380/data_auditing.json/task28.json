The payment_method of this transaction was bank transfer, and this transaction was paid. This transaction was prepared by Supervisor, and the approver is Director. The supplier ID is S007, and the supplier name is Supplier 7.\"\n\n**But the recorded data shows**:\n- Date: 2024-01-30 (instead of 2023-12-31)\n- Amount: $44832.96 (instead of $40000.00)\n- Unit price: $16274.12 (instead of $20000.00)\n\nThe inconsistencies are:\n1. The date is recorded as 2024-01-30 but the invoice states 2023-12-31\n2. The total amount is recorded as $44832.96 but should be $40000.00 (based on 2 units Ã— $20000.00)\n3. The unit price is recorded as $16274.12 but should be $20000.00 according to the invoice\n\nFor \"Sale20240130057\", there's another discrepancy:\n\n**Invoice states**: \"On January 30, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 3.0 units at a unit price of $24766.75, totaling $74300.25. The cost amount for this transaction was $60000.00, with a tax amount of $3715.01, leading to a total amount due of $70585.24. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\n**But the recorded data shows**:\n- Date: 2024-02-01 (instead of 2024-01-30)\n- Amount: $90992.35 (instead of $74300.25)\n- Unit price: $21750.10 (instead of $24766.75)\n\nThis transaction has discrepancies in the date, amount, and unit price.\n\nBased on my analysis of the \"Purchase20231231006\" transaction:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2023-12-31', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-30', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '20000.00', 'Recorded price': '16274.12', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '40000.00', 'Recorded amount': '44832.96', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Purchase20231231006'} }\n```",
