Transaction ID: `Expense20240129001`\n   - The recorded date is February 14, 2024 (`2024-02-14`)\n   - However, the invoice clearly states \"On January 29, 2024\" \n   - This is a date inconsistency where the recorded date doesn't match the invoice date\n\n2. Transaction ID: `Purchase20231231029`\n   - The recorded date is January 16, 2024 (`2024-01-16`)\n   - However, the invoice clearly states \"On December 31, 2023\"\n   - Again, this is a date inconsistency\n\nSince the task asks for the inconsistencies between recorded fields and their correct values, I'll provide the solution for the first discrepancy I found:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original date': '2024-01-29', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-14', 'id': 'Expense20240129001'} }\n```\n\nThis solution indicates that for transaction ID 'Expense20240129001', the original (correct) date should be January 29, 2024, but it was incorrectly recorded as February 14, 2024.",
