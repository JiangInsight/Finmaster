First, I notice transaction ID `Sale20240119036` has an inconsistency:\n   - The ID starts with \"Sale\" but the recorded_type is \"Sales Expenses\"\n   - The invoice confirms it should be a Sale: \"an invoice was issued for a Sale\"\n   - Additionally, the unit price in the invoice ($193401.60) doesn't match the recorded_unit_price ($161422.98)\n\n2. Looking at Purchase20231231001:\n   - The recorded_amount is $10,000 which matches unit price ($5,000) Ã— quantity (2)\n   - The recorded_preparer is \"Supervisor\" which matches the invoice description\n   - No inconsistencies found\n\n3. Examining other transactions, I'm looking for discrepancies between numeric fields, types, dates, and statuses compared to the invoice details.\n\nThe transaction \"Sale20240119036\" is the only one with clear inconsistencies:\n1. Its recorded type is \"Sales Expenses\" but should be \"Sale\" based on both the ID and invoice\n2. The unit price recorded ($161,422.98) doesn't match what's in the invoice ($193,401.60)\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that transaction \"Sale20240119036\" has two errors: incorrect transaction type and incorrect unit price.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '193401.6', 'Recorded price': '161422.98', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240119036'} }\n```",
