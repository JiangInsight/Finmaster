The invoice (which is more reliable) indicates 1.0 unit was purchased at $5000.00 for a total of $5000.00, but the recorded quantity is 0.0 units and the recorded amount is $0.0.\n\nThe recorded fields don't match what the invoice states, which would be the accurate information. This means the quantity and amount fields contain errors.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '1.0', 'Recorded quantity': '0.0', 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '5000.00', 'Recorded amount': '0.0', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Purchase20231231005'} }\n```",
