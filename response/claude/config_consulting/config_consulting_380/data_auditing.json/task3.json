The payment_method of this transaction was account payable, and this transaction was **unpaid**. This transaction was prepared by Supervisor, and the approver is Director. The supplier ID is S003, and the supplier name is Supplier 3.\"\n\nThis is inconsistent - the recorded status is \"Paid\" but the invoice clearly states it was \"unpaid\". Since the invoice is considered more reliable, the correct payment status should be \"Unpaid\".\n\nI also notice an issue with Interest20240121021:\n- recorded_payment/receipt_status: Paid\n- But the invoice states: \"The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nAgain, there's an inconsistency between the recorded status and what the invoice states.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Interest20240121021'} }",
