Date inconsistency:\n   - Recorded date: 2024-01-28\n   - Invoice states: \"On January 04, 2024, an invoice was issued...\"\n   - Original date should be 2024-01-04\n\n2. Quantity inconsistency:\n   - Recorded quantity: 0.0\n   - Invoice states: \"consisting of 1.0 units...\"\n   - Original quantity should be 1.0\n\n3. Price inconsistency:\n   - Recorded unit price: 12441.39\n   - Invoice states: \"at a unit price of $10372.82...\"\n   - Original price should be 10372.82\n\n4. Amount inconsistency:\n   - Recorded amount: 11684.25\n   - Invoice states: \"totaling $10372.82\"\n   - Original amount should be 10372.82\n\nThe invoice details are more reliable, so I'll use those values as the correct ones.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-04', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-28', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '1.0', 'Recorded quantity': '0.0', 'Original price': '10372.82', 'Recorded price': '12441.39', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '10372.82', 'Recorded amount': '11684.25', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240104008'} }\n```",
