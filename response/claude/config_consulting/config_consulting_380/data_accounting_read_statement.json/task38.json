When there's a decrease, it means the company collected on those receivables (which increases cash flow).\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement, I can see the line item:\n\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with a value of \"-2117339.65\"\n\nThe negative value (-2117339.65) indicates that there was an increase in accounts receivable during the period (rather than a decrease). This means more money is owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit.\n\nTherefore, the value for the decrease in amounts owed to the entity is -2117339.65.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2117339.65'}}\n```",
