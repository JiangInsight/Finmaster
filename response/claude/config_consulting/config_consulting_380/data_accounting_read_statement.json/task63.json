Taxes accrued but not yet paid (from Balance Sheet)\n3. Total income from ordinary activities (from Income Statement)\n\nLet me go through each statement systematically:\n\nFrom the **Balance Sheet**, I see:\n- Taxes Payable: 131850.51 (this is the taxes accrued but not yet paid)\n\nFrom the **Income Statement**, I see:\n- Total Revenue/Main Business Revenue: 2637011.03 (this is the total income arising from ordinary activities)\n\nFrom the **Cash Flow Statement**, I see:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -1028375.55 (this is the net amount of cash generated from principal revenue-producing activities)\n\nSo the three values I need to extract are:\n- value1: 131850.51 (Taxes Payable)\n- value2: 2637011.03 (Total Revenue)\n- value3: -1028375.55 (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '131850.51', 'value2': '2637011.03', 'value3': '-1028375.55'}}\n```",
