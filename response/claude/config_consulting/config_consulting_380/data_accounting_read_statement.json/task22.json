Total Revenue is $2,637,011.03\n2. Total Cost is $1,015,000.00\n\nThe difference between revenue and cost is typically represented by the Gross Profit line item.\n\nIn the statement, I can see that Gross Profit is indeed $1,622,011.03, which is exactly the difference between Total Revenue and Total Cost:\n$2,637,011.03 - $1,015,000.00 = $1,622,011.03\n\nTherefore, the value that represents the difference between revenue and cost is $1,622,011.03.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1622011.03'}}\n```",
