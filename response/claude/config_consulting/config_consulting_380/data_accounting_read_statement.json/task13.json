I can see that \"Total Non-current Assets\" is explicitly listed in the balance sheet.\n2. The initial value as of 2023-12-31 is 5000000.00\n3. The end value as of 2024-02-05 is 4993018.52\n\nThese non-current assets consist of Fixed Assets (5085889.19) minus Accumulated Depreciation (92870.67), resulting in a net value of 4993018.52.\n\nTherefore, the total assets not expected to be realized in the normal operating cycle are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '4993018.52'}}\n```",
