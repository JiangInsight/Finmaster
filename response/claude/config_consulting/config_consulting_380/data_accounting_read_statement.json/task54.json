These costs might include sales commissions, advertising, marketing campaigns, delivery costs, etc.\n\nSince \"Selling Expenses\" is the line item that most directly relates to costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services, the value I should extract is $402,699.98.\n\n{\"solution\": {'value': '402699.98'}}",
