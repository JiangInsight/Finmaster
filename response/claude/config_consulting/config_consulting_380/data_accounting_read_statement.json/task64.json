Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods/services received or purchased on credit\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares\n\nLet me review each financial statement carefully:\n\n**Balance Sheet**:\n- Looking for shareholder capital: \"Paid-in Capital\" with end amount of 13000000.00\n- Looking for accounts payable: \"Accounts Payable\" with end amount of 247000.00\n\n**Income Statement**:\n- Looking for profit before tax: \"Profit Before Tax\" with amount of 967117.02\n\n**Cash Flow Statement**:\n- Confirms the accounts payable increase: \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with amount of 247000.00\n\nTherefore, the three values I need to extract are:\n1. Paid-in Capital (shareholder contributions): 13000000.00\n2. Profit Before Tax: 967117.02\n3. Accounts Payable (amount owed for goods/services): 247000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '967117.02', 'value3': '247000.00'} }\n```",
