This means the company invested an additional $203,000 in inventory rather than reducing inventory.\n\nHowever, the task asks for the \"reduction\" in inventory, which would be represented by a positive number in this line. Since we have a negative number, this actually represents an increase in inventory, not a reduction.\n\nTherefore, the value for the reduction in inventory is \"-203000.00\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-203000.00'}}\n```",
