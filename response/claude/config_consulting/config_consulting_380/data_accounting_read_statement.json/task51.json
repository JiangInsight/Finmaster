In accounting, this is typically represented as \"Interest Receivable\" on the balance sheet.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, I can see:\n- \"Interest Receivable\" with Initial_amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- \"Interest Receivable\" with End_amount: 15023.59 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\nI can verify this is indeed interest accrued but not received by checking the cash flow statement, which shows:\n- \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" of -15023.59\n\nAdditionally, the income statement shows:\n- \"Interest Income\" of 15023.59\n\nThis confirms that while the company has recognized the interest income of 15023.59, it hasn't yet received the cash, which is why it appears as a receivable on the balance sheet.\n\nTherefore, the initial value of interest accrued but not yet received was 0.00, and the end value is 15023.59.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '15023.59'} }\n```",
