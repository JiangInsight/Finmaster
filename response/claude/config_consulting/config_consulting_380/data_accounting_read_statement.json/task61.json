Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services to customers\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement to find these items:\n\nFor the first item (costs to secure customer orders), this would typically be represented by \"Selling Expenses\" in the income statement, which includes costs related to sales, marketing, and delivery.\n\nLooking at the income statement, I can see:\n- Selling Expenses: 402699.98\n\nFor the second item (cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment), this would be found in the cash flow statement under investing activities.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement, I can see:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 85889.19\n\nTherefore, the two values I'm looking for are:\n1. Selling Expenses: 402699.98\n2. Purchase of Fixed Assets: 85889.19\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '402699.98', 'value2': '85889.19'}}\n```",
