Since the example solution only included \"Cash on Hand\" and not the sum of both cash accounts, I'll follow the same approach.\n\nTherefore, the cash available for day-to-day operations is:\n- Initial value: 3000000.00 (Cash on Hand on 2023-12-31)\n- End value: 2602624.45 (Cash on Hand on 2024-02-05)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '3000000.00', 'end value': '2602624.45'}}\n```",
