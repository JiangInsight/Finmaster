This is exactly what we're looking for.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial value of \"Taxes Payable\" as of 2023-12-31: 0.00\n- End value of \"Taxes Payable\" as of 2024-02-05: 131850.51\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '131850.51'}}\n```",
