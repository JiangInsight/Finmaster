Beginning Balance: 8000000.00\n2. Ending Balance: 6885735.26\n\nThese two values together represent the change in cash position, with the difference between them being the net increase/decrease value.\n\nI'll format this as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1114264.74', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_item value2': '6885735.26'}}}\n```",
