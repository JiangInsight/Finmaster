These are typically classified as \"current assets\" on the balance sheet.\n\nLooking at the provided balance sheet, I can see that there is a line item specifically labeled \"Total Current Assets\". Current assets include cash, bank deposits, receivables, inventory, and other assets that are expected to be converted to cash or used up within one year or the normal operating cycle.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial value of Total Current Assets (2023-12-31): 8000000.00\n- End value of Total Current Assets (2024-02-05): 9221098.50\n\nThese are the values I need to report as they represent the assets expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of operations.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '9221098.50'}}\n```",
