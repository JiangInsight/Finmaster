Current liabilities are obligations that will be settled within one year or within the normal operating cycle, whichever is longer.\n\nIn the balance sheet provided, I can see:\n- \"Total Current Liabilities\" line item, which represents all liabilities expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle\n- The initial amount is 0.00 as of 2023-12-31\n- The end amount is 378850.51 as of 2024-02-05\n\nTherefore, the total amount of liabilities expected to be settled in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle is:\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- End value: 378850.51\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '378850.51'}}\n```",
