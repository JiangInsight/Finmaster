Cost of Goods Sold - These are direct costs of delivering the goods and services\n2. Selling Expenses - These are costs associated with securing customer orders\n\nIn this case, the items that fit the description are:\n- Cost of Goods Sold: $1,015,000.00\n- Selling Expenses: $402,699.98\n\nTogether, these represent the costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services. However, based on the example solution provided, it appears the task is specifically asking for the \"Selling Expenses\" value.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '402699.98'}}\n```",
