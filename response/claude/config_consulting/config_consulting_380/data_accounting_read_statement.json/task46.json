Purchase of Fixed Assets: 85889.19\n2. Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -85889.19\n\nThe net cash flow from investing activities is -85889.19, which represents a cash outflow. This makes sense because the company spent money to purchase fixed assets.\n\nThe only component sub-item contributing to this value is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of 85889.19 (positive number representing the expense amount).\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-85889.19', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '85889.19'}}}\n```",
