In the balance sheet as \"Taxes Payable\" with an end amount of 131,850.51\n2. In the cash flow statement as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an amount of 131,850.51\n3. In the income statement as \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of 131,850.51\n\nThe task asks for the specific value of the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay or recover. The \"Tax Expense\" line in the income statement represents the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 131,850.51.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '131850.51'} }\n```",
