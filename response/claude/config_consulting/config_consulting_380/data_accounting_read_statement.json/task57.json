Looking at the balance sheet, I can see that \"Accounts Payable\" represents amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\n2. The initial amount of Accounts Payable was $0.00 on 2023-12-31, and the end amount is $247,000.00 on 2024-02-05.\n\n3. To confirm this, I should check the cash flow statement, where I can find \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is listed as $247,000.00.\n\n4. This positive value in the cash flow statement indicates an increase in Accounts Payable during the period, which represents the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit.\n\nTherefore, the value of the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is $247,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '247000.00'} }\n```",
