                        "content": "I'll calculate the four financial ratios step by step based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThe debt to equity ratio is calculated as: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities = $378,850.51 (from balance sheet - Total Current Liabilities)\n- Total Equity = $13,835,266.51 (from balance sheet - Total Owner's Equity)\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $378,850.51 / $13,835,266.51 = 0.0274 ≈ 0.03\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\nThe net profit margin is calculated as: Net Profit / Total Revenue × 100%\n\n- Net Profit = $835,266.51 (from income statement)\n- Total Revenue = $2,637,011.03 (from income statement)\n\nNet Profit Margin = ($835,266.51 / $2,637,011.03) × 100% = 31.67%\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\nROA is calculated as: Net Profit / Total Assets × 100%\n\n- Net Profit = $835,266.51 (from income statement)\n- Total Assets = $14,214,117.02 (from balance sheet)\n\nROA = ($835,266.51 / $14,214,117.02) × 100% = 5.88%\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables and is calculated as:\nTotal Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nSince we only have the ending accounts receivable amount and not the beginning (which was $0), I'll use:\n- Total Credit Sales (Revenue) = $2,637,011.03 (assuming all sales were on credit)\n- Average Accounts Receivable = ($0 + $2,117,339.65) / 2 = $1,058,669.83\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $2,637,011.03 / $1,058,669.83 = 2.49\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.67%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '5.88%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.49'} }\n```",
