                        "content": "I'll calculate each of these financial ratios step by step using the provided financial statements.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis measures the company's ability to cover current liabilities with operating cash flow.\n- Operating Cash Flow = -1,028,375.55 (from cash flow statement)\n- Current Liabilities = 378,850.51 (from balance sheet)\n- Ratio = -1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 = -2.71\n\n## 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures the company's financial leverage.\n- Total Liabilities = 378,850.51 (from balance sheet, current liabilities only)\n- Total Equity = 13,835,266.51 (from balance sheet)\n- Ratio = 378,850.51 / 13,835,266.51 = 0.03\n\n## 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently the company uses its assets to generate sales.\n- Revenue = 2,637,011.03 (from income statement)\n- Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 14,214,117.02) / 2 = 13,607,058.51\n- Ratio = 2,637,011.03 / 13,607,058.51 = 0.19\n\n## 4. Quick Ratio\nThis measures the company's ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n- Quick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 9,221,098.50 - 203,000.00 = 9,018,098.50\n- Current Liabilities = 378,850.51\n- Ratio = 9,018,098.50 / 378,850.51 = 23.80\n\n## 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n- Ratio = -2.71\n\n## 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\nThis measures how efficiently the company uses its equity to generate profits.\n- Net Income = 835,266.51 (from income statement)\n- Average Equity = (13,000,000.00 + 13,835,266.51) / 2 = 13,417,633.26\n- ROE = (835,266.51 / 13,417,633.26) Ã— 100% = 6.23%\n\n## 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently the company collects revenue.\n- Revenue = 2,637,011.03 (from income statement)\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 2,117,339.65) / 2 = 1,058,669.83\n- Ratio = 2,637,011.03 / 1,058,669.83 = 2.49\n\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.71', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.19', 'Quick Ratio': '23.80', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.71', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '6.23%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.49'} }",
