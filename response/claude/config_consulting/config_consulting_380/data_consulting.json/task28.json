Debt to Asset Ratio\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated as Total Liabilities / Total Assets.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $378,850.51\n- Total Assets = $14,214,117.02\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $378,850.51 / $14,214,117.02 = 0.0266 ≈ 0.03\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\nThe Gross Profit Margin is calculated as Gross Profit / Total Revenue × 100%.\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = $1,622,011.03\n- Total Revenue = $2,637,011.03\n\nGross Profit Margin = $1,622,011.03 / $2,637,011.03 × 100% = 61.51%\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThe Operating Cash Flow Ratio is calculated as Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$1,028,375.55\n- Total Current Liabilities = $378,850.51\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$1,028,375.55 / $378,850.51 = -2.71\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Gross Profit Margin': '61.51%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.71'} }\n```",
