                        "content": "I'll calculate these financial ratios step by step based on the provided financial statements.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to cover current liabilities with cash generated from operations.\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,028,375.55\n- Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 = -2.71\n\n## 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay its total debt with its operating cash flow.\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,028,375.55\n- Total Liabilities = 378,850.51\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 = -2.71\n\n## 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period.\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 1,015,000.00\n- Average Inventory = (0 + 203,000.00) / 2 = 101,500.00\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = 1,015,000.00 / 101,500.00 = 10.00\n\n## 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures the proportion of debt a company has relative to its equity.\n- Total Liabilities = 378,850.51\n- Total Owner's Equity = 13,835,266.51\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = 378,850.51 / 13,835,266.51 = 0.03\n\n## 5. Quick Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n- Quick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 9,221,098.50 - 203,000.00 = 9,018,098.50\n- Current Liabilities = 378,850.51\n- Quick Ratio = 9,018,098.50 / 378,850.51 = 23.80\n\n## 6. Current Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations.\n- Current Assets = 9,221,098.50\n- Current Liabilities = 378,850.51\n- Current Ratio = 9,221,098.50 / 378,850.51 = 24.34\n\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.71', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.71', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '10.00', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Quick Ratio': '23.80', 'Current Ratio': '24.34'}}",
