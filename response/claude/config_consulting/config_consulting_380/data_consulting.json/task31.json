Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company collects credit sales from customers.\n- Formula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n- Net Credit Sales = Total Revenue = $2,637,011.03\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2 = ($0 + $2,117,339.65) / 2 = $1,058,669.83\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover = $2,637,011.03 / $1,058,669.83 = 2.49\n\n## 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to cover current liabilities with operating cash flow.\n- Formula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n- Operating Cash Flow = -$1,028,375.55\n- Current Liabilities = $378,850.51\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -$1,028,375.55 / $378,850.51 = -2.71\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is essentially the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -$1,028,375.55 / $378,850.51 = -2.71\n\n## 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n- Formula: Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n- Net Sales = Total Revenue = $2,637,011.03\n- Average Total Assets = (Beginning Assets + Ending Assets) / 2 = ($13,000,000 + $14,214,117.02) / 2 = $13,607,058.51\n- Total Asset Turnover Ratio = $2,637,011.03 / $13,607,058.51 = 0.19\n\n## 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures a company's financial leverage.\n- Formula: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n- Total Liabilities = $378,850.51\n- Total Equity = $13,835,266.51\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = $378,850.51 / $13,835,266.51 = 0.03\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.49', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-2.71', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.71', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.19', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03'}}\n```",
