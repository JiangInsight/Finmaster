Let's solve this step-by-step.\n\n## Step 1: Calculate Debt to Equity Ratio\nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = $378,850.51\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = $378,850.51\n- Total Owner's Equity = $13,835,266.51\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $378,850.51 / $13,835,266.51 = 0.0274 ≈ 0.03\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Net Profit Margin\nNet Profit Margin = Net Profit / Total Revenue × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = $835,266.51\n- Total Revenue = $2,637,011.03\n\nNet Profit Margin = ($835,266.51 / $2,637,011.03) × 100% = 31.67%\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$1,028,375.55\n- Total Current Liabilities = $378,850.51\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -$1,028,375.55 / $378,850.51 = -2.71\n\n## Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.67%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.71'}}\n```",
