The Debt to Equity Ratio is calculated by dividing the total liabilities by the total equity.\n\nStep 1: Identify the total liabilities from the balance sheet.\n- Total Current Liabilities = $378,850.51\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = $378,850.51\n\nStep 2: Identify the total equity.\n- Total Owner's Equity = $13,835,266.51\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio.\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = $378,850.51 / $13,835,266.51 = 0.0273826\n\nStep 4: Round the ratio to 2 decimal places.\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = 0.03\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03'}}\n```",
