The formula is:\n\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = Net Sales (Revenue) / Average Total Assets\n\nStep 1: Identify the Net Sales (Revenue)\nFrom the income statement, I can see that:\n- Main Business Revenue = $2,637,011.03\n- Total Revenue = $2,637,011.03\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Average Total Assets\nI need to take the average of the beginning and ending total assets:\n- Beginning Total Assets (Initial amount) = $13,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets (End amount) = $14,214,117.02\n- Average Total Assets = ($13,000,000.00 + $14,214,117.02) / 2 = $13,607,058.51\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = $2,637,011.03 / $13,607,058.51 = 0.1938\n\nStep 4: Round to 2 decimal places\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = 0.19\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.19'}}",
