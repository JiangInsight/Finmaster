First, I need to find the Net Credit Sales. This typically comes from the income statement as \"Main Business Revenue\" which is $2,637,011.03.\n\n2. Next, I need to calculate the Average Accounts Receivable:\n   - Beginning Accounts Receivable: $0 (from the initial balance sheet)\n   - Ending Accounts Receivable: $2,117,339.65 (from the end balance sheet)\n   - Average Accounts Receivable = ($0 + $2,117,339.65) / 2 = $1,058,669.83\n\n3. Now I can calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:\n   Accounts Receivable Turnover = $2,637,011.03 / $1,058,669.83 = 2.49\n\nTherefore, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is 2.49.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.49'} }\n```",
