The Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated by dividing Total Liabilities by Total Assets.\n\nFirst, let me identify the relevant values from the balance sheet:\n\n1. Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $378,850.51\n   (There are no long-term liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities equals Total Current Liabilities)\n\n2. Total Assets = $14,214,117.02\n\nNow, I'll calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $378,850.51 / $14,214,117.02\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 0.0266 or approximately 0.03 (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\nTherefore, the Debt to Asset Ratio as of 2024-02-05 is 0.03.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03'}}\n```",
