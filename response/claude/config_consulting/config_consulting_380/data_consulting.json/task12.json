                        "content": "I need to calculate the Return on Equity (ROE) based on the financial statements provided. ROE measures a company's profitability by showing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested.\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\nROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity × 100%\n\nLet's extract the necessary information:\n\n1. Net Income (from income statement): $835,266.51\n2. Initial Owner's Equity (from balance sheet): $13,000,000.00\n3. End Owner's Equity (from balance sheet): $13,835,266.51\n\nThe average shareholders' equity is:\nAverage Shareholders' Equity = (Initial Owner's Equity + End Owner's Equity) / 2\nAverage Shareholders' Equity = ($13,000,000.00 + $13,835,266.51) / 2\nAverage Shareholders' Equity = $13,417,633.26\n\nNow I can calculate the ROE:\nROE = $835,266.51 / $13,417,633.26 × 100%\nROE = 0.06225 × 100%\nROE = 6.23%\n\nTherefore, the Return on Equity is 6.23%.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '6.23%'}}",
