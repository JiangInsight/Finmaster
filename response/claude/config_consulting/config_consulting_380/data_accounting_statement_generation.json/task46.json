Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | 3000000.0\n2. Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0\n\nThese are the two initial transactions that represent the starting cash and cash equivalents. The sum of these would be the beginning balance:\n\n3,000,000.00 (Cash deposit) + 5,000,000.00 (Bank deposit) = 8,000,000.00\n\nThis makes sense as the beginning balance for the cash flow statement, representing all available cash and cash equivalents at the start of the period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
