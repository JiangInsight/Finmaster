This will involve identifying all the sales transactions and summing up their associated cost amounts.\n\n## Step 1: Identify all sales transactions\nSales transactions have \"Sale\" in their type field. For each sale, I need to look at the \"cost_amount\" column which represents the cost of the goods that were sold.\n\n## Step 2: Sum up all the cost_amount values from sale transactions\nLet me go through all the transactions and add up the cost_amount for every sale transaction:\n\nSale20240102003: cost_amount = 5,000.0\nSale20240103005: cost_amount = 5,000.0\nSale20240104007: cost_amount = 5,000.0\nSale20240104008: cost_amount = 5,000.0\nSale20240104009: cost_amount = 1,000.0\nSale20240108013: cost_amount = 20,000.0\nSale20240111017: cost_amount = 20,000.0\nSale20240112018: cost_amount = 100,000.0\nSale20240112019: cost_amount = 20,000.0\nSale20240113021: cost_amount = 5,000.0\nSale20240113022: cost_amount = 20,000.0\nSale20240113023: cost_amount = 5,000.0\nSale20240114024: cost_amount = 5,000.0\nSale20240114025: cost_amount = 20,000.0\nSale20240115027: cost_amount = 100,000.0\nSale20240115028: cost_amount = 20,000.0\nSale20240117030: cost_amount = 100,000.0\nSale20240117031: cost_amount = 5,000.0\nSale20240117032: cost_amount = 5,000.0\nSale20240118033: cost_amount = 1,000.0\nSale20240118034: cost_amount = 1,000.0\nSale20240119036: cost_amount = 100,000.0\nSale20240119037: cost_amount = 100,000.0\nSale20240122040: cost_amount = 20,000.0\nSale20240124043: cost_amount = 20,000.0\nSale20240124044: cost_amount = 100,000.0\nSale20240124045: cost_amount = 1,000.0\nSale20240125048: cost_amount = 20,000.0\nSale20240126050: cost_amount = 20,000.0\nSale20240126051: cost_amount = 20,000.0\nSale20240126052: cost_amount = 1,000.0\nSale20240127055: cost_amount = 1,000.0\nSale20240127056: cost_amount = 1,000.0\nSale20240131059: cost_amount = 1,000.0\nSale20240131060: cost_amount = 20,000.0\nSale20240201062: cost_amount = 5,000.0\nSale20240201063: cost_amount = 1,000.0\nSale20240202065: cost_amount = 5,000.0\nSale20240203068: cost_amount = 100,000.0\nSale20240203069: cost_amount = 1,000.0\nSale20240205072: cost_amount = 5,000.0\nSale20240205073: cost_amount = 5,000.0\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total COGS\nAdding up all the cost_amount values:\n5,000 + 5,000 + 5,000 + 5,000 + 1,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 + 100,000 + 20,000 + 5,000 + 20,000 + 5,000 + 5,000 + 20,000 + 100,000 + 20,000 + 100,000 + 5,000 + 5,000 + 1,000 + 1,000 + 100,000 + 100,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 + 100,000 + 1,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 + 1,000 + 1,000 + 1,000 + 1,000 + 20,000 + 5,000 + 1,000 + 5,000 + 100,000 + 1,000 + 5,000 + 5,000 = 1,040,000\n\nTherefore, the total Cost of Goods Sold is 1,040,000.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cost of Goods Sold': '1040000.00'} }\n```",
