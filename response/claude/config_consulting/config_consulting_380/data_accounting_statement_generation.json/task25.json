However, to ensure I haven't missed anything, let me check if the \"profit\" field in the data already contains this calculation, which would make my verification more straightforward:\n\nLooking at the first few sales:\n- Sale20240102003: amount = $13,728.16, cost_amount = $5,000.00, profit = $8,728.16\n- Sale20240103005: amount = $11,367.21, cost_amount = $5,000.00, profit = $6,367.21\n\nThe profit field does indeed equal (amount - cost_amount), which confirms my approach.\n\nTherefore, the gross profit from all sales transactions is $1,536,613.47.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit': '1536613.47'} }",
