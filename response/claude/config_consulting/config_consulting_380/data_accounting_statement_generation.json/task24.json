First, I need to identify all purchase transactions that represent costs\n2. Add up all the purchases to get the total cost\n\nLooking through the data, I need to analyze all \"Purchase\" transactions. These represent the company's cost of goods sold or services rendered.\n\nLet me identify and sum up all the \"Purchase\" rows:\n\n```\nPurchase20231231001: 10,000.00\nPurchase20231231002: 10,000.00\nPurchase20231231003: 1,000.00\nPurchase20231231004: 40,000.00\nPurchase20231231005: 5,000.00\nPurchase20231231006: 40,000.00\nPurchase20231231007: 15,000.00\nPurchase20231231008: 200,000.00\nPurchase20231231009: 20,000.00\nPurchase20231231010: 20,000.00\nPurchase20231231011: 300,000.00\nPurchase20231231012: 5,000.00\nPurchase20231231013: 2,000.00\nPurchase20231231014: 20,000.00\nPurchase20231231015: 20,000.00\nPurchase20231231016: 40,000.00\nPurchase20231231017: 2,000.00\nPurchase20231231018: 100,000.00\nPurchase20231231019: 20,000.00\nPurchase20231231020: 1,000.00\nPurchase20231231021: 1,000.00\nPurchase20231231022: 5,000.00\nPurchase20231231023: 3,000.00\nPurchase20231231024: 20,000.00\nPurchase20231231025: 5,000.00\nPurchase20231231026: 100,000.00\nPurchase20231231027: 10,000.00\nPurchase20231231028: 200,000.00\nPurchase20231231029: 3,000.00\n```\n\nAdding all these purchase amounts:\n10,000 + 10,000 + 1,000 + 40,000 + 5,000 + 40,000 + 15,000 + 200,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 + 300,000 + 5,000 + 2,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 + 40,000 + 2,000 + 100,000 + 20,000 + 1,000 + 1,000 + 5,000 + 3,000 + 20,000 + 5,000 + 100,000 + 10,000 + 200,000 + 3,000 = 1,218,000\n\nHowever, I need to be careful with my interpretation. In accounting, the \"Total Cost\" in an income statement typically refers to the cost of goods sold or cost of services provided.\n\nLooking at the purchase transactions more carefully, these appear to be purchases of services that the company will resell. \n\nI need to sum up all the purchase amounts by product type:\n- S001 (Basic Consulting): 1,000 + 2,000 + 2,000 + 1,000 + 1,000 + 3,000 + 3,000 = 13,000\n- S002 (Standard Consulting): 10,000 + 10,000 + 5,000 + 15,000 + 5,000 + 5,000 + 5,000 + 10,000 = 65,000\n- S003 (Premium Consulting): 40,000 + 40,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 + 40,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 = 240,000\n- S004 (Enterprise Solution): 200,000 + 300,000 + 100,000 + 100,000 + 200,000 = 900,000\n\nTotal: 13,000 + 65,000 + 240,000 + 900,000 = 1,218,000\n\nTherefore, the total cost of services purchased is $1,218,000.00.\n\nActually, looking at the problem more carefully, I need to align with the format from the example. In the example solution, the \"Total Cost\" was 4,410,000.00, which appears to be the sum of all purchase transactions (including purchases of chemical products).\n\nFollowing the same approach for my problem, the total cost is the sum of all purchase transactions, which is $1,218,000.00.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Cost': '1218000.00'}}",
