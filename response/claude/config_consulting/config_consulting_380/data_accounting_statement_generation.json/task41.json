Purchase20231231001: 10,000.00 (Unpaid)\n2. Purchase20231231002: 10,000.00 (Unpaid)\n3. Purchase20231231003: 1,000.00 (Unpaid)\n4. Purchase20231231004: 40,000.00 (Unpaid)\n5. Purchase20231231005: 5,000.00 (Unpaid)\n6. Purchase20231231007: 15,000.00 (Unpaid)\n7. Purchase20231231013: 2,000.00 (Unpaid)\n8. Purchase20231231014: 20,000.00 (Unpaid)\n9. Purchase20231231015: 20,000.00 (Unpaid)\n10. Purchase20231231017: 2,000.00 (Unpaid)\n11. Purchase20231231020: 1,000.00 (Unpaid)\n12. Purchase20231231021: 1,000.00 (Unpaid)\n13. Purchase20231231024: 20,000.00 (Unpaid)\n14. Purchase20231231026: 100,000.00 (Unpaid)\n\nNow, I'll sum up all these unpaid accounts payable amounts:\n10,000 + 10,000 + 1,000 + 40,000 + 5,000 + 15,000 + 2,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 + 2,000 + 1,000 + 1,000 + 20,000 + 100,000 = 247,000.00\n\nIn the cash flow statement, this represents the increase in accounts payable from the beginning of the period. Since these are all from 2023-12-31 and remain unpaid through the reporting period, they represent the full increase in accounts payable.\n\nThe final accounts payable item in the cash flow statement would be an increase of $247,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '247000.00'} }\n```",
