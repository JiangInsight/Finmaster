After reviewing the data, I don't see any disposals or sales of non-current assets during the period.\n\nLet me finalize the values:\n- Initial value: 5,000,000.00\n- Ending value: 4,993,018.52\n\nLet me return this in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '4993018.52'} }\n```",
