Accounts receivable represents money owed to the company from sales made on credit (Account Receivable payment method).\n\n## Step 1: Understand what to look for\n- I need to find all sales transactions with payment status \"Unpaid\" and receive method \"Account Receivable\"\n- Initial value would be from the initial setup (if any) or considered as 0 if not explicitly stated\n- Final value would be the sum of all unpaid receivables at the end of the period\n\n## Step 2: Find all relevant sales transactions\nLet me identify all sales transactions with \"Account Receivable\" as the receive method:\n\n- Sale20240103005: 11,367.21 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240104007: 12,470.63 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240104008: 10,372.82 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240104009: 2,183.69 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240108013: 54,355.58 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240111017: 58,578.75 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240112018: 293,182.36 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240112019: 58,814.47 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240113021: 10,735.69 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240113022: 55,716.09 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240113023: 14,087.68 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240114024: 14,850.89 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240114025: 47,339.29 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240115027: 270,292.77 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240117030: 280,131.74 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240117031: 10,866.84 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240117032: 12,808.07 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240118033: 1,843.66 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240118034: 2,197.86 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240119036: 193,401.60 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240122040: 42,265.05 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240124044: 298,580.20 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240124045: 2,172.51 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240126050: 58,733.47 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240126052: 2,069.59 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240127055: 2,127.40 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240131060: 47,420.60 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240203068: 225,665.95 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240203069: 1,917.12 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240205072: 9,646.63 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240205073: 11,143.44 (unpaid)\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total accounts receivable\nAdding all the unpaid sales with \"Account Receivable\" payment method:\n\nTotal Accounts Receivable = 2,117,339.65\n\n## Step 4: Verify if there were any initial accounts receivable\nLooking at the beginning entries, I don't see any accounts receivable items in the initial balances. The initial deposits only show cash, bank deposits, and fixed assets.\n\nTherefore, the initial accounts receivable value is 0.00.\n\n## Step 5: Check for any collections or write-offs of accounts receivable\nI didn't see any transactions showing collections of previous accounts receivable or write-offs, so I don't need to subtract any amounts from the total.\n\n## Final calculation\nInitial Accounts Receivable: 0.00\nFinal Accounts Receivable: 2,117,339.65\n\nLet me double-check this calculation one more time:\n\nAfter recounting, I need to add the values of all the unpaid accounts receivable transactions:\n11,367.21 + 12,470.63 + 10,372.82 + 2,183.69 + 54,355.58 + 58,578.75 + 293,182.36 + 58,814.47 + 10,735.69 + 55,716.09 + 14,087.68 + 14,850.89 + 47,339.29 + 270,292.77 + 280,131.74 + 10,866.84 + 12,808.07 + 1,843.66 + 2,197.86 + 193,401.60 + 42,265.05 + 298,580.20 + 2,172.51 + 58,733.47 + 2,069.59 + 2,127.40 + 47,420.60 + 225,665.95 + 1,917.12 + 9,646.63 + 11,143.44 = 2,117,339.65\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accounts Receivable End Value': '2117339.65'} }\n```",
