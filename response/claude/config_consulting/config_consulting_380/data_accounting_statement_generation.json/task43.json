Let me verify by looking at each transaction type more systematically:\n\n1. Initial deposits are not operating activities: \n   - Initial20231231001 (Cash deposit): 3,000,000.00\n   - Initial20231231001 (Bank deposit): 5,000,000.00\n   - Initial20231231001 (Fixed Assets): 5,000,000.00\n\n2. Fixed asset purchases are not operating activities:\n   - FixedAsset20231231001: -85,889.19\n\n3. Cash-to-bank transfers are not operating activities (they're just moving cash from one form to another)\n\n4. All expenses paid in cash are operating outflows: -538,976.72 (calculated above)\n\n5. All purchases paid in cash/bank transfer are operating outflows: -971,000.00 (calculated above)\n\n6. All sales received in cash are operating inflows: +519,671.38 (calculated above)\n\n7. Depreciation is a non-cash item (doesn't affect cash flow)\n   - Depreciation20240101001: 45,753.24\n   - Depreciation20240201002: 47,117.43\n\nLet's verify my final calculation:\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 519,671.38 - 971,000.00 - 538,976.72 = -990,305.34\n\nTherefore, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is -990,305.34.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities': '-990305.34'} }\n```",
