The Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n2. The Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = $116,257.19\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = $967,271.87\n\nNow I'll calculate the ratio:\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities รท Total Current Liabilities\n= $116,257.19 รท $967,271.87\n= 0.1202\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the ratio is 0.12.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.12'} }\n```",
