Net Credit Sales (typically revenue)\n2. Average Accounts Receivable\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Credit Sales = Main Business Revenue = $3,025,437.82\n\nFor Average Accounts Receivable:\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable (from initial balance sheet) = $0.00\n- Ending Accounts Receivable (from end balance sheet) = $1,716,911.17\n- Average Accounts Receivable = ($0.00 + $1,716,911.17) / 2 = $858,455.59\n\nNow I can calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $3,025,437.82 / $858,455.59 = 3.524\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: 3.52\n\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.52'} }",
