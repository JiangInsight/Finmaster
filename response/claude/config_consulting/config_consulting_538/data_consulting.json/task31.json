                        "content": "I'll calculate each of the requested financial ratios step by step.\n\n## 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company collects credit sales.\n- Formula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n- Net Credit Sales = Revenue = $3,025,437.82\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2 = ($0 + $1,716,911.17) / 2 = $858,455.59\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $3,025,437.82 / $858,455.59 = 3.52\n\n## 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis measures how well current liabilities are covered by cash flow from operations.\n- Formula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n- Operating Cash Flow = $116,257.19\n- Current Liabilities = $967,271.87\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = $116,257.19 / $967,271.87 = 0.12\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = $116,257.19 / $967,271.87 = 0.12\n\n## 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n- Formula: Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n- Net Sales = Revenue = $3,025,437.82\n- Average Total Assets = (Beginning Assets + Ending Assets) / 2 = ($13,000,000 + $14,930,535.06) / 2 = $13,965,267.53\n- Total Asset Turnover Ratio = $3,025,437.82 / $13,965,267.53 = 0.22\n\n## 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures a company's financial leverage.\n- Formula: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n- Total Liabilities = $967,271.87\n- Total Equity = $13,963,263.19\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = $967,271.87 / $13,963,263.19 = 0.07\n\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.52', 'operating cash flow ratio': '0.12', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.12', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.22', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.07'} }",
