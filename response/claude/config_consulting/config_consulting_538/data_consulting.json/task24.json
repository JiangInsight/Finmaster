Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit\n\nLet me calculate each ratio step by step:\n\n### Debt to Asset Ratio\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $967,271.87\n- Total Assets = $14,930,535.06\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $967,271.87 / $14,930,535.06 = 0.0648 ≈ 0.06\n\n### Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\nFrom the cash flow statement and income statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = $116,257.19\n- Net Profit = $963,263.19\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = $116,257.19 / $963,263.19 = 0.1207 ≈ 0.12\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '0.12'} }\n```",
