Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\nThis ratio compares operating cash flow to net income to assess the quality of earnings.\n\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Net Income\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = $116,257.19\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = $963,263.19\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = $116,257.19 / $963,263.19 = 0.1207\n\n## 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales.\n\nFormula: Total Revenue / Average Current Assets\n\nFrom the financial statements:\n- Total Revenue = $3,025,437.82\n- Initial Current Assets = $8,000,000.00\n- End Current Assets = $10,022,038.12\n- Average Current Assets = ($8,000,000.00 + $10,022,038.12) / 2 = $9,011,019.06\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = $3,025,437.82 / $9,011,019.06 = 0.3358\n\n## 3. Quick Ratio\nThe quick ratio measures a company's ability to meet short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n\nFormula: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = $10,022,038.12\n- Inventory = $174,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = $967,271.87\n\nQuick Ratio = ($10,022,038.12 - $174,000.00) / $967,271.87 = $9,848,038.12 / $967,271.87 = 10.1813\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '0.12', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.34', 'Quick Ratio': '10.18'}}\n```",
