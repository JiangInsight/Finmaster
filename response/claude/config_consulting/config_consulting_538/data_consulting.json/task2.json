The Quick Ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n\nThe formula for Quick Ratio is:\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nStep 1: Identify the Current Assets from the balance sheet.\nTotal Current Assets = $10,022,038.12\n\nStep 2: Subtract Inventory from Current Assets.\nInventory = $174,000.00\nCurrent Assets - Inventory = $10,022,038.12 - $174,000.00 = $9,848,038.12\n\nStep 3: Identify the Current Liabilities.\nTotal Current Liabilities = $967,271.87\n\nStep 4: Calculate the Quick Ratio.\nQuick Ratio = $9,848,038.12 / $967,271.87 = 10.18\n\nStep 5: Round to 2 decimal places.\nQuick Ratio = 10.18\n\nTherefore, the Quick Ratio as of 2024-02-05 is 10.18.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '10.18'}}\n```",
