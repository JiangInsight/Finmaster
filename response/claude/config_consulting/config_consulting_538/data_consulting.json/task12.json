The formula for ROE is:\n\nROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the income statement, I can see that:\n- Net Income (Net Profit) = $963,263.19\n\nFor the Average Shareholders' Equity, I need to calculate the average between the beginning and ending total owner's equity:\n- Beginning Owner's Equity (Initial) = $13,000,000.00\n- Ending Owner's Equity (End) = $13,963,263.19\n- Average Shareholders' Equity = ($13,000,000.00 + $13,963,263.19) / 2 = $13,481,631.60\n\nNow I can calculate ROE:\nROE = $963,263.19 / $13,481,631.60 = 0.0714 or 7.14%\n\nTherefore, the Return on Equity (ROE) is 7.14%.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '7.14%'} }\n```",
