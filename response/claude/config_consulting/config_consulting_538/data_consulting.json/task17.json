In this case, the debt consists of:\n- Accounts Payable: $816,000.00\n- Taxes Payable: $151,271.87\nTotal Debt = $816,000.00 + $151,271.87 = $967,271.87\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio.\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = $116,257.19 / $967,271.87 = 0.12\n\nStep 4: Round to two decimal places.\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = 0.12\n\nTherefore, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is 0.12.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.12'} }\n```",
