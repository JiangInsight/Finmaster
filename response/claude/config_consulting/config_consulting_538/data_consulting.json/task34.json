                        "content": "I'll solve these financial ratios step by step using the provided financial statements.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to cover current liabilities with cash generated from operations.\n- Operating Cash Flow = $116,257.19\n- Current Liabilities = $967,271.87\n- Ratio = $116,257.19 ÷ $967,271.87 = 0.12\n\n## 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures the proportion of debt compared to equity.\n- Total Liabilities = $967,271.87\n- Total Equity = $13,963,263.19\n- Ratio = $967,271.87 ÷ $13,963,263.19 = 0.07\n\n## 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n- Revenue = $3,025,437.82\n- Average Total Assets = ($13,000,000.00 + $14,930,535.06) ÷ 2 = $13,965,267.53\n- Ratio = $3,025,437.82 ÷ $13,965,267.53 = 0.22\n\n## 4. Quick Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n- Quick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = $10,022,038.12 - $174,000.00 = $9,848,038.12\n- Current Liabilities = $967,271.87\n- Ratio = $9,848,038.12 ÷ $967,271.87 = 10.18\n\n## 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis measures how well current liabilities are covered by cash flow from operations.\n- Operating Cash Flow = $116,257.19\n- Current Liabilities = $967,271.87\n- Ratio = $116,257.19 ÷ $967,271.87 = 0.12\n\n## 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses equity to generate profits.\n- Net Profit = $963,263.19\n- Average Equity = ($13,000,000.00 + $13,963,263.19) ÷ 2 = $13,481,631.60\n- ROE = ($963,263.19 ÷ $13,481,631.60) × 100% = 7.14%\n\n## 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company collects on its receivables.\n- Revenue = $3,025,437.82\n- Average Accounts Receivable = ($0 + $1,716,911.17) ÷ 2 = $858,455.59\n- Ratio = $3,025,437.82 ÷ $858,455.59 = 3.52\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"0.12\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.07\", \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.22\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"10.18\", \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"0.12\", \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"7.14%\", \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.52\"}}\n```",
