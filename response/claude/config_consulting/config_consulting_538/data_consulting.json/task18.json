The formula is:\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the given financial statements:\n\n1. Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = $116,257.19 (from the cash flow statement)\n2. Total Current Liabilities = $967,271.87 (from the balance sheet)\n\nNow, I'll calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = $116,257.19 / $967,271.87 = 0.12\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: 0.12\n\nTherefore, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is 0.12.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.12'}}\n```",
