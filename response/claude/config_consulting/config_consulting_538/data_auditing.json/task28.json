I'll pay special attention to the invoice information which is considered more reliable.\n\nLet me start by examining Purchase20231231002:\n\n1. From the invoice field: \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Purchase, consisting of 3.0 units at a unit price of $20000.00, totaling $60000.00.\"\n2. However, the recorded data shows:\n   - recorded_date: 2024-01-14 (different from invoice date)\n   - recorded_amount: $65952.94 (different from invoice total)\n   - recorded_unit_price: $18917.63 (different from invoice unit price)\n\nThis is clearly inconsistent. The invoice mentions a purchase on December 31, 2023, with a unit price of $20000.00 and total amount of $60000.00, but the recorded fields show different values.\n\nLet me also check for any other inconsistencies in other transactions...\n\nI don't see any other clear inconsistencies in the other transactions. The main issue I found is with Purchase20231231002 where multiple fields disagree with the invoice information.\n\nHere's my solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": \"2023-12-31\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-14\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"20000.00\", \"Recorded price\": \"18917.63\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"60000.00\", \"Recorded amount\": \"65952.94\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Purchase20231231002\"}}\n```",
