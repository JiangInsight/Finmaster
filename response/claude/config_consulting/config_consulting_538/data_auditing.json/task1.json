The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $2954.54, leading to a total amount due of $56136.21. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nThe invoice clearly describes this as a \"Sale\" transaction, not \"Sales Expenses\". Additionally, all other details in the invoice match the pattern of a Sale transaction with product information, unit price, tax amount, etc.\n\nSince the invoice is considered more reliable, the correct transaction type should be \"Sale\" rather than \"Sales Expenses\".\n\nNo other inconsistencies were identified in this dataset.\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240131075\"}}",
