The profit calculation in the invoice ($5000.00 cost + $517.18 tax = $5,343.58 profit from $10,343.58 total) makes mathematical sense, while the recorded data does not.\n\nI don't see any other significant discrepancies in the other transactions that would warrant reporting based on the invoice text compared to the recorded fields.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-15', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-23', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '10343.58', 'Recorded price': '11023.50', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '10343.58', 'Recorded amount': '12327.47', 'Original tax': '517.18', 'Recorded tax': '11155.11', 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240115035'} }\n```",
