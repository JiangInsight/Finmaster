Inconsistencies between invoice details and recorded values\n2. Fields that don't match other related fields\n3. Transactions where dates, amounts, or categorizations appear incorrect\n\nLooking at each transaction carefully, I noticed an inconsistency in the transaction with ID \"Sale20240117044\":\n\n1. The recorded type is \"Administrative Expenses\" but the invoice description and other fields indicate this should be a \"Sale\" transaction\n2. The recorded date is \"2024-02-15\" but the invoice states it was issued on \"January 17, 2024\"\n3. The recorded amount is $2,826.32 which differs from the unit price Ã— quantity ($2,365.03) mentioned in the invoice description\n\nThis transaction has multiple inconsistencies - the transaction type, date, and amount are all inconsistent with what's described in the invoice text, which is considered more reliable.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Administrative Expenses', 'Original date': '2024-01-17', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-15', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '1.0', 'Recorded quantity': '1.0', 'Original price': '2365.03', 'Recorded price': '2365.03', 'Original receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Original amount': '2365.03', 'Recorded amount': '2826.32', 'Original tax': '118.25', 'Recorded tax': '118.25', 'Original profit': '1365.03', 'Recorded profit': '1365.03', 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240117044'} }\n```",
