The cost amount for this transaction was $5000.00, with a tax amount of $477.66, leading to a total amount due of $9075.64.\"\n\nThere's a clear discrepancy between the recorded tax amount (7415.65) and the tax amount stated in the invoice (477.66). The invoice is considered more reliable as the source document.\n\nThe correct tax amount should be 477.66, not 7415.65.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': '477.66', 'Recorded tax': '7415.65', 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240113031'} }",
