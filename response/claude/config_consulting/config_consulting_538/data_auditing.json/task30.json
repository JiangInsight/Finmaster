The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $1963.80, leading to a total amount due of $37312.19. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nThis confirms the inconsistencies. The transaction should be a Sale (not Purchase), the total amount should be $39,275.99, the unit price should match this amount (since quantity is 1), and the tax should be $1,963.80.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Purchase\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"39275.99\", \"Recorded price\": \"32018.98\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"39275.99\", \"Recorded amount\": \"48330.94\", \"Original tax\": \"1963.80\", \"Recorded tax\": \"41399.1\", \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240112026\"}}\n```",
