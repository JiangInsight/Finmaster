The only other transaction that catches my attention is \"Expense20240130001\" where the invoice amount might differ from the recorded amount, but I need to look more closely at this one.\n\nFor \"Expense20240130001\" (Administrative Expenses):\n- Recorded amount: 37712.1\n- Invoice states: \"totaling $32705.96\"\n- Recorded payment_status: \"Unpaid\"\n- Invoice states: \"this transaction was paid\"\n\nThis transaction also has inconsistencies in both amount and payment status.\n\nAfter reviewing all transactions thoroughly, these are the only two with clear inconsistencies between their recorded values and the information in the invoice.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '411.80', 'Recorded amount': '440.50', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Interest20240116016'} }\n```",
