Quantity/amount inconsistencies\n2. Type/category mismatches \n3. Mathematical errors (e.g., tax calculations, totals)\n4. Status or method inconsistencies\n\nLooking at transaction ID Sale20240111022:\n- It's recorded as \"Sales Expenses\" but the invoice clearly states it's for a \"Sale\"\n- The recorded_amount is 0.0, but the invoice mentions a unit price of $46958.27\n- The recorded_quantity is 0.0, but the invoice indicates 1.0 unit was sold\n- This is definitely an inconsistency where transaction type and quantity were incorrectly entered\n\nThis is the main inconsistency I found in the dataset.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"0.0\", \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"46958.27\", \"Recorded amount\": \"0.0\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240111022\"}}\n```",
