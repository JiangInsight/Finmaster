The quantity should be 1.0 but is recorded as 0.0\n2. The payment/receipt status should be \"Unpaid\" but is recorded as \"Paid\"\n3. The amount should be $256,579.57 but is recorded as $0.0\n\nThe most critical inconsistencies are in transaction `Sale20240111023`.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '1.0', 'Recorded quantity': '0.0', 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '256579.57', 'Recorded amount': '0.0', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240111023'} }\n```",
