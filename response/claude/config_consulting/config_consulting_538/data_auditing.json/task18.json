The recorded_amount is 0.0, but the invoice describes a sale totaling $49,544.93\n2. The recorded_quantity is 0.0, but the invoice mentions 1.0 unit\n3. The recorded_payment/receipt_status is \"Paid\", but the invoice states \"unpaid\"\n4. The recorded_profit is $26,765.80, but based on the invoice information, it should be $29,544.93 (unit price of $49,544.93 minus cost of $20,000.00)\n\nThe reference invoice is generally considered more reliable, so these are clear inconsistencies.\n\nTherefore, the inconsistencies for Sale20240103003 are:\n- recorded_amount should be $49,544.93 instead of 0.0\n- recorded_quantity should be 1.0 instead of 0.0\n- recorded_payment/receipt_status should be \"Unpaid\" instead of \"Paid\"\n- recorded_profit should be $29,544.93 instead of $26,765.80\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '1.0', 'Recorded quantity': '0.0', 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '49544.93', 'Recorded amount': '0.0', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': '29544.93', 'Recorded profit': '26765.80', 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240103003'} }\n```",
