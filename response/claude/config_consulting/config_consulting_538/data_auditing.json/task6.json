The invoice specifies a unit price of $2189.34, but the recorded_unit_price field shows $2611.49, which doesn't match the total amount. Since the invoice is considered more reliable, and the total amount matches what would be expected with a unit price of $2189.34, the recorded_unit_price is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"2189.34\", \"Recorded price\": \"2611.49\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240129068\"}}\n```",
