The recorded category is \"Depreciation\" but the invoice describes it as a \"Sale\"\n2. The recorded amount is $13,741.57, but the invoice mentions a unit price of $12,805.90 with a total of $12,805.90\n3. The invoice describes a sale transaction with cost amount, tax, and profit details, not a depreciation\n\nThis transaction has clear discrepancies between the recorded type and amount versus what's described in the invoice.\n\n## Expense20240128001\nLooking at this entry:\n- The recorded category is \"Sales Expenses\"\n- The recorded amount is $23,867.23\n- But the invoice describes it as \"Administrative Expenses, totaling $22,083.91\"\n\nThis transaction has inconsistencies in both category and amount.\n\nI didn't identify other clear inconsistencies in the remaining transactions where the recorded values contradicted the information in the invoice descriptions.\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll provide my solution focusing on the identified transactions with discrepancies:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Depreciation\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"12805.9\", \"Recorded amount\": \"13741.57\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240112025\"} }\n```",
