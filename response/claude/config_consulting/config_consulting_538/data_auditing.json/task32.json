Amount calculation errors (quantity × unit price ≠ recorded amount)\n2. Date discrepancies\n3. Quantity/price inconsistencies\n4. Other contradictions between fields\n\nLet me examine the Purchase20231231028 transaction:\n\nThe invoice states: \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Purchase, consisting of 3.0 units at a unit price of $1000.00, totaling $3000.00.\"\n\nHowever, the recorded data shows:\n- Date: 2024-01-29 (should be 2023-12-31)\n- Amount: $2000.00 (should be $3000.00 based on invoice)\n- Quantity: 2.0 (should be 3.0 based on invoice)\n- Unit price: $801.72 (should be $1000.00 based on invoice)\n\nThis transaction contains multiple inconsistencies between the recorded data and what the invoice states. The invoice is considered more reliable as it's standardized and regulated.\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2023-12-31', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-29', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '3.0', 'Recorded quantity': '2.0', 'Original price': '1000.00', 'Recorded price': '801.72', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '3000.00', 'Recorded amount': '2000.00', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Purchase20231231028'} }\n```",
