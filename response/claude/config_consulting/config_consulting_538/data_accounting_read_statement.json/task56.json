In the balance sheet, I can see \"Accumulated Depreciation\" with an end amount of 91,503.06.\n\n2. In the cash flow statement, there's a line item \"Depreciation\" with a value of 91,503.06.\n\n3. In the income statement, there's also a line item \"Depreciation\" with the same value of 91,503.06.\n\nThe depreciation expense represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.
