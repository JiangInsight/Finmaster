Income earned by an entity from financial assets\n\nLet me examine each financial statement to find these items.\n\n### Balance Sheet\nLooking at the balance sheet, I can see:\n- \"Bank Deposits\" with an end amount of 4,579,000.00 on 2024-02-05\nThis represents funds deposited into a bank, so value1 = 4579000.00\n\n### Income Statement\nLooking at the income statement, I can see:\n- \"Interest Income\" with an amount of 14,869.76 on 2024-02-05\nThis represents income earned from financial assets, so value2 = 14869.76\n\nTherefore, the two values I need to extract are:\n- value1 (Bank Deposits): 4579000.00\n- value2 (Interest Income): 14869.76\n\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '4579000.00', 'value2': '14869.76'}}",
