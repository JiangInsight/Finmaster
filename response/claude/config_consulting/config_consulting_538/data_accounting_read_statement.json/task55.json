First, I'll check the Balance Sheet:\n   - I see \"Taxes Payable\" with an end amount of 151,271.87 as of 2024-02-05.\n\n2. Next, I'll check the Income Statement:\n   - I see a line item \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of 151,271.87 for 2024-02-05.\n\n3. Finally, I'll check the Cash Flow statement:\n   - I see \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" of 151,271.87 for 2024-02-05.\n\nAll three statements consistently show the same tax amount. The \"Tax Expense\" from the Income Statement represents the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during this reporting period is 151,271.87.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '151271.87'} }\n```",
