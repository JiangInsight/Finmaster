Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\nFor the first item, this typically refers to \"Selling Expenses\" which includes marketing, sales commissions, and delivery costs. From the income statement, I can see:\n- Selling Expenses: 345311.74\n\nFor the second item, this refers to capital expenditures, which would appear in the Cash Flow Statement under investing activities as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\":\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 0.00\n\nLooking at the Cash Flow Statement, I can see that the Purchase of Fixed Assets is 0.00 for the period, which means there were no cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment during this period.\n\nTherefore:\n\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '345311.74', 'value2': '0.00'}}",
