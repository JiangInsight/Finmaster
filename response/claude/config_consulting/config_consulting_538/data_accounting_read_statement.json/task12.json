These are typically classified as current assets.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet provided:\n\n1. Current assets include:\n   - Cash on Hand\n   - Bank Deposits\n   - Interest Receivable\n   - Accounts Receivable\n   - Inventory\n\n2. The total of these current assets is specifically listed as \"Total Current Assets\" in the balance sheet\n\n3. From the data:\n   - Initial value of Total Current Assets: 8000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n   - End value of Total Current Assets: 10022038.12 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\nSince the question specifically asks for the total assets expected to be realized or intended for sale in the normal operating cycle, the \"Total Current Assets\" line item is exactly what we're looking for.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10022038.12'}}\n```",
