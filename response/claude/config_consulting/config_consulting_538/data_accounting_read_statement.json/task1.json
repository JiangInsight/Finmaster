Since the task asks for the cash held by an entity available for use in day-to-day operations, I need to determine whether to include one or both of these line items.\n\nIn financial accounting, \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" typically includes both cash on hand and bank deposits, as both represent highly liquid assets available for operational use. \n\nHowever, based on the example solution provided, only the \"Cash on Hand\" line item was included in the answer, not the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\". Following this precedent from the example:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '3000000.00', 'end value': '3537257.19'}}\n```",
