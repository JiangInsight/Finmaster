Amounts owed to the entity for goods/services sold on credit (accounts receivable)\n2. Financing costs incurred for operation (financial expenses)\n3. Cash payments to acquire long-term assets (purchase of fixed assets)\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\n## 1. Balance Sheet\nLooking at the balance sheet, I can find \"Accounts Receivable\" with an end amount of 1716911.17 on 2024-02-05. This represents amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit.\n\n## 2. Income Statement\nIn the income statement, I can find \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of 50166.99 on 2024-02-05. This represents financing costs incurred by the enterprise.\n\n## 3. Cash Flow Statement\nIn the cash flow statement, I can find \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an amount of 0.00 on 2024-02-05. This represents cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\nTherefore, the three values I need to extract are:\n1. Accounts Receivable: 1716911.17\n2. Financial Expenses: 50166.99\n3. Purchase of Fixed Assets: 0.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1716911.17', 'value2': '50166.99', 'value3': '0.00'} }\n```",
