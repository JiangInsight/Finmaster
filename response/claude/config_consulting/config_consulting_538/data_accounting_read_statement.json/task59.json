The net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nStep 1: Let me analyze each statement to find these values.\n\nFor the interest accrued but not yet received, I should look at the Balance Sheet for an \"Interest Receivable\" line item.\n- In the Balance Sheet, I can see \"Interest Receivable\" with an End_amount of 14869.76.\n\nFor the net addition in cash and cash equivalents, I should look at the Cash Flow Statement.\n- In the Cash Flow Statement, I can see the line \"Net Increase\" with an Amount of 116257.19.\n\nStep 2: Extract the values:\n- Interest accrued but not yet received: 14869.76\n- Net addition in cash and cash equivalents: 116257.19\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '14869.76', 'value2': '116257.19'} }\n```",
