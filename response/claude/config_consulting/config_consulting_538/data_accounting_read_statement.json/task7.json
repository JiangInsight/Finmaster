In accounting, accumulated depreciation represents the total depreciation expense that has been recorded over time for fixed assets. This is an expense that reduces the value of assets over their useful life.\n\nFrom the balance sheet, I can see:\n- Accumulated Depreciation: Initial amount of 0.00 on 2023-12-31\n- Accumulated Depreciation: End amount of 91503.06 on 2024-02-05\n\nThis shows that during this period, the company incurred a depreciation expense that resulted in an accumulated depreciation of 91503.06.\n\nTherefore, the expense item I need to extract is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '91503.06'}}\n```",
