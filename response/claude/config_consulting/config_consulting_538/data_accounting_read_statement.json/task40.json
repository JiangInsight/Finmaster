When Accounts Payable increases, it means the company has purchased more goods or services on credit than it has paid for during the period.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement:\n- \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" shows an amount of 816000.00\n- This positive number indicates an increase in accounts payable, meaning the company has added to its credit obligations\n\nTherefore, the value of the addition in the amount owed for goods or services received on credit is 816000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '816000.00'}}\n```",
