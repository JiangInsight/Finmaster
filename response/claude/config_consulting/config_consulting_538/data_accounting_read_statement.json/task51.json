First, I'll check the balance sheet for any \"Interest Receivable\" or similar accounts:\n   - I found \"Interest Receivable\" with an initial amount of 0.00 on 2023-12-31 and an end amount of 14869.76 on 2024-02-05.\n\n2. I'll verify this in the cash flow statement:\n   - There is a line \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" with an amount of -14869.76, which represents the increase in interest receivable (shown as negative because it's an outflow from a cash perspective).\n\n3. I'll check the income statement:\n   - There is \"Interest Income\" of 14869.76, which corresponds to the amount in the balance sheet.\n\nThese line items represent interest that has been earned/accrued but not yet received in cash. The Interest Receivable account shows the amount of interest that has been recognized as income but not yet collected in cash.\n\nTherefore:\n- Initial value: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- End value: 14869.76 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '14869.76'} }\n```",
