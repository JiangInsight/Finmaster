Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period\n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole\n\nLet me analyze the income statement:\n\n1. Total income arising in ordinary activities would be represented by \"Total Revenue\", which is 3025437.82\n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold would be represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\", which is 1312000.00\n3. Costs of general management and administration would be represented by \"Administrative Expenses\", which is 126790.73\n\nThese are the three values I need to extract in the order they appear in the statement.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3025437.82', 'value2': '1312000.00', 'value3': '126790.73'}}\n```",
