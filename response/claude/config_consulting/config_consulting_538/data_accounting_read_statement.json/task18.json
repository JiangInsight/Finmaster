Tangible items held for use in production, services, rental, or administration\n3. Tax accrued but not yet paid\n\nLet me analyze the balance sheet:\n\n1. Cash held for day-to-day operations would be \"Cash on Hand\"\n   - Initial value: 3000000.00\n   - End value: 3537257.19\n\n2. Tangible items held for use in production/services would be \"Fixed Assets\"\n   - Initial value: 5000000.00\n   - End value: 5000000.00\n\n3. Tax accrued but not yet paid would be \"Taxes Payable\"\n   - Initial value: 0.00\n   - End value: 151271.87\n\nThese are the three specific line items I need to extract, maintaining their original order as shown in the input statement.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '3000000.00', 'end valu1': '3537257.19', 'initial value2': '5000000.00', 'end valu2': '5000000.00', 'initial value3': '0.00', 'end valu3': '151271.87'}}\n```",
