In this case, it's -0.00, which essentially means zero.\n\nThe only sub-item contributing to this value is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of 0.00. This appears as a positive number in the statement, but it's a cash outflow (which is why the net cash flow shows as negative).\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-0.00\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value\": \"0.00\"}}}\n```",
