Inventory represents assets held for sale in ordinary business operations\n2. Changes in inventory are reported in operating activities section of cash flow statement\n\nIn the provided statement, I can see:\n\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with a value of \"-174000.00\"\n\nThe negative value indicates an increase in inventory (more money tied up in inventory). However, the task asks for \"reduction\" in such assets, which would be a positive value. Since the value is negative, this actually represents an increase in inventory rather than a reduction.\n\nNevertheless, this is the line item that tracks changes in assets held for sale, so I should report this value.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-174000.00'}}\n```",
