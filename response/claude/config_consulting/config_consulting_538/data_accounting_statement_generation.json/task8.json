Let's analyze step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any depreciation entries in the data:\n\n1. The first depreciation transaction is on January 1, 2024:\n   ```\n   Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45752.22 | 45752.22\n   ```\n\n2. Another depreciation transaction on February 1, 2024:\n   ```\n   Depreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | 2024-02-01 | 2024-02-01 | 45750.84 | 45750.84\n   ```\n\nTo determine the accumulated depreciation:\n- The \"Initial Value\" would be the balance at the beginning of the period (December 31, 2023)\n- The \"End Value\" would be the accumulated total at the end of the period\n\nSince we're looking at January transactions, I need to determine:\n1. What was the accumulated depreciation on December 31, 2023\n2. What is the accumulated depreciation on January 31, 2024\n\nLooking at the data:\n- There are no depreciation entries before January 1, 2024, which suggests that the initial accumulated depreciation was 0.\n- The first depreciation entry on January 1, 2024 is 45752.22.\n- There are no other depreciation entries in January.\n\nTherefore:\n- Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value (December 31, 2023): 0.00\n- Accumulated Depreciation End Value (January 31, 2024): 45752.22\n\nI'll format this in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accumulated Depreciation End Value': '45752.22'} }\n```",
