Since the problem is asking for the initial and final values of the Interest Receivable in the balance sheet:\n\n1. Initial Value: Before the first interest receivable transaction, the balance would be 0, as there's no mention of any prior interest receivable.\n\n2. Final Value: To calculate the final value, I need to sum up all these interest receivable transactions:\n   \nSum = 430.76 + 430.76 + 429.425 + 420.525 + 420.525 + 420.525 + 416.52 + 416.52 + 416.52 + 412.07 + 412.07 + 412.07 + 412.07 + 411.803 + 411.803 + 411.803 + 411.803 + 411.803 + 411.803 + 411.536 + 411.536 + 411.536 + 411.536 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.709 + 407.709 + 407.709 + 407.531\n\nThe sum of all these transactions gives us 14,915.146, which would be the end value of the Interest Receivable.\n\nHowever, looking more carefully at the data, I notice that these transactions might represent the daily accrual of interest, not additional interest. In that case, the final balance would be the last entry: 407.531.\n\nBut considering that all these are marked as \"Unpaid\" in the payment/receipt status, and the receive_method is \"Interest receviable\", it's likely that these represent the accrual of interest over time.\n\nLet me look at the example solution to understand the expected approach: in the example, the Interest Receivable Initial Value was 0.00 and the End Value was 2672.87, which suggests that we are summing up all the interest receivable transactions.\n\nSince all transactions have a consistent type of \"Interest Receivables\", it appears these are individual interest accruals that accumulate in the balance sheet.\n\nTherefore:\n- Initial Value: 0.00 (since there's no mention of any prior interest receivable)\n- Final Value: Sum of all interest receivable transactions = 14,915.15\n\nActually, let me double check this sum to make sure it's accurate:\nSum = 430.76 + 430.76 + 429.425 + 420.525 + 420.525 + 420.525 + 416.52 + 416.52 + 416.52 + 412.07 + 412.07 + 412.07 + 412.07 + 411.803 + 411.803 + 411.803 + 411.803 + 411.803 + 411.803 + 411.536 + 411.536 + 411.536 + 411.536 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.709 + 407.709 + 407.709 + 407.531\n\nThis adds up to approximately 14,915.15.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Interest Receivable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Interest Receivable End Value': '14915.15'} }\n```",
