                        "content": "I need to calculate the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) based on the transactions data provided. COGS represents the direct costs attributable to the goods sold during the period.\n\nLet me analyze this step by step:\n\n1. First, I need to identify all sale transactions in the data.\n2. For each sale, I'll extract the cost_amount, which represents the cost of the goods that were sold.\n3. I'll sum up all these cost_amount values to get the total COGS.\n\nLooking at the data, I can see \"Sale\" transactions with the \"cost_amount\" field populated. Each of these represents a sale where goods were moved from inventory to the customer, and the cost_amount represents the cost basis of those goods.\n\nLet me count all the sale entries and sum their cost_amount values:\n\nSale entries identified:\n- Sale20240102001: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240102002: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240103003: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240103004: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240106008: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240106009: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240106010: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240108013: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240108014: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240109016: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240110019: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240111021: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240111022: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240111023: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240112025: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240112026: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240112027: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240113029: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240113030: cost_amount = 1000.0\n- Sale20240113031: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240114033: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240115034: cost_amount = 1000.0\n- Sale20240115035: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240115036: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240116039: cost_amount = 1000.0\n- Sale20240116040: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240117043: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240117044: cost_amount = 1000.0\n- Sale20240118046: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240119047: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240120050: cost_amount = 1000.0\n- Sale20240120051: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240120052: cost_amount = 1000.0\n- Sale20240121053: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240122056: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240122057: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240124059: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240124060: cost_amount = 1000.0\n- Sale20240127064: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240127065: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240127066: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240128067: cost_amount = 1000.0\n- Sale20240129068: cost_amount = 1000.0\n- Sale20240130071: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240130072: cost_amount = 1000.0\n- Sale20240131075: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240131076: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240201077: cost_amount = 1000.0\n- Sale20240201078: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240203081: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240204083: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240205085: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240205086: cost_amount = 1000.0\n\nNow, let me sum up all the cost_amount values:\n\n100000 + 20000 + 20000 + 20000 + 5000 + 5000 + 5000 + 20000 + 5000 + 100000 + 5000 + 20000 + 20000 + 100000 + 5000 + 20000 + 5000 + 100000 + 1000 + 5000 + 100000 + 1000 + 5000 + 100000 + 1000 + 100000 + 5000 + 1000 + 20000 + 20000 + 1000 + 5000 + 1000 + 20000 + 20000 + 5000 + 20000 + 1000 + 5000 + 20000 + 20000 + 1000 + 1000 + 5000 + 1000 + 20000 + 5000 + 1000 + 20000 + 100000 + 5000 + 100000 + 1000 = 1,351,000\n\nTherefore, the Cost of Goods Sold is $1,351,000.00.\n\nLet me verify this again to ensure accuracy:\n\nSumming all cost_amount values from sale transactions:\n= 1,351,000.00\n\nTo properly format this as required:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cost of Goods Sold': '1351000.00'} }\n```\n\n{\"solution\": {'Cost of Goods Sold': '1351000.00'} }",
