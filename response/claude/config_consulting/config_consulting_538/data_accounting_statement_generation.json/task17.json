Looking at the initial transactions, I see only:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00 \n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00\n\nThere's no specific retained earnings line item shown in the initial data, so we can assume it starts at 0.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Revenue (from Sales)\nI need to sum all sales transactions:\n\n```\nTotal Sales = Sum of all \"Sale\" transactions\n```\n\nGoing through all the transactions with type \"Sale\", the total sales amount is:\n2,189,293.89\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Cost of Goods Sold\nFor COGS, I'll look at the \"cost_amount\" column in the sales transactions:\n\n```\nCOGS = Sum of cost_amount for all sales transactions\n```\n\nThe total cost of goods sold is:\n943,000.00\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Gross Profit\n\n```\nGross Profit = Total Sales - COGS = 2,189,293.89 - 943,000.00 = 1,246,293.89\n```\n\n### Step 5: Identify and Sum Expenses\nNow I need to sum all expense transactions:\n\n- Administrative Expenses: 111,507.86\n- Sales Expenses: 218,793.83\n- Financial Expenses: 41,362.08\n- Depreciation: 91,503.06 (from both January and February entries)\n\nTotal Expenses = 463,166.83\n\n### Step 6: Calculate Interest Income\nLet me sum the interest receivables:\n\n```\nInterest Income = Sum of all Interest Receivables transactions\n```\n\nTotal Interest Income = 12,304.45\n\n### Step 7: Calculate Net Income\n\n```\nNet Income = Gross Profit + Interest Income - Total Expenses\n           = 1,246,293.89 + 12,304.45 - 463,166.83\n           = 795,431.51\n```\n\n### Step 8: Calculate Final Retained Earnings\n\n```\nFinal Retained Earnings = Initial Retained Earnings + Net Income\n                        = 0 + 795,431.51\n                        = 795,431.51\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe initial retained earnings is 0.00, and the final retained earnings is 795,431.51.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Retained Earnings Initial Value': '0.00', 'Retained Earnings End Value': '795,431.51'} }\n```",
