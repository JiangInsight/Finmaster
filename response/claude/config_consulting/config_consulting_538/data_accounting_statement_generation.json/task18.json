                        "content": "I need to calculate the owner's equity at the beginning and end of the period based on the transaction data.\n\nOwner's equity represents the residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting liabilities. The initial owner's equity can be obtained from the initial deposits, and the ending owner's equity will be affected by the net income/loss during the period.\n\nLet's start by identifying the initial deposits:\n\n1. Initial owner's equity:\n   - Cash deposit: $3,000,000.00\n   - Bank deposit: $5,000,000.00\n   - Fixed Assets: $5,000,000.00\n   \n   Total initial owner's equity = $3,000,000.00 + $5,000,000.00 + $5,000,000.00 = $13,000,000.00\n\n2. To calculate the ending owner's equity, I need to identify all the income and expenses during the period:\n\n   Income components:\n   - Sales profit (found in the \"profit\" column of sale transactions)\n   - Interest receivables\n\n   Expense components:\n   - Administrative expenses\n   - Sales expenses\n   - Financial expenses\n   - Depreciation\n\nLet me calculate the total profit from sales:\n- Adding up all the values in the \"profit\" column for sale transactions: approximately $1,151,843.65\n\nLet me calculate the total interest receivables:\n- Adding up all the \"Interest Receivables\" transactions: approximately $12,463.48\n\nTotal income = $1,151,843.65 + $12,463.48 = $1,164,307.13\n\nLet me calculate the total expenses:\n- Administrative expenses: approximately $120,151.85\n   (Found by summing all \"Administrative Expenses\" amounts)\n- Sales expenses: approximately $261,945.14\n   (Found by summing all \"Sales Expenses\" amounts)\n- Financial expenses: approximately $41,362.08\n   (Found by summing all \"Financial Expenses\" amounts)\n- Depreciation: $45,752.22 + $45,750.84 = $91,503.06\n\nTotal expenses = $120,151.85 + $261,945.14 + $41,362.08 + $91,503.06 = $514,962.13\n\nNet income = Total income - Total expenses = $1,164,307.13 - $514,962.13 = $649,345.00\n\nThe ending owner's equity = Initial owner's equity + Net income\n= $13,000,000.00 + $649,345.00 = $13,649,345.00\n\nLet me verify this calculation once more to ensure accuracy...\n\nI notice that there are purchase transactions, but since those represent inventory which becomes part of assets or cost of goods sold (already accounted for in profit calculations), I don't need to subtract them again.\n\nActually, it seems there's been an error in my calculations. Let me recalculate to ensure accuracy:\n\nI need to be careful with my approach. The profit from sales already accounts for the cost of goods sold. The interest receivables are income. Expenses need to be subtracted.\n\nLet me rethink this:\n\nInitial owner's equity: $13,000,000.00\n\nEnding owner's equity = Initial owner's equity + Net income\n\nFor net income, let me check all revenue and expense items from January 1 to February 5:\n\nRevenue:\n- Sales profit (from profit column): approximately $1,151,843.65\n- Interest receivables: approximately $12,463.48\nTotal revenue: $1,164,307.13\n\nExpenses:\n- Administrative expenses: approximately $120,151.85\n- Sales expenses: approximately $261,945.14\n- Financial expenses: approximately $41,362.08\n- Depreciation: $91,503.06\nTotal expenses: $514,962.13\n\nNet income = $1,164,307.13 - $514,962.13 = $649,345.00\n\nTherefore, ending owner's equity = $13,000,000.00 + $649,345.00 = $13,649,345.00\n\nI'm concerned about the accuracy of my manual calculations, especially with many transactions to sum up. Let me double-check my math and approach to ensure correctness...\n\nBased on my calculations, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Owners Equity Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Total Owners Equity End Value': '13649345.00'} }\n```",
