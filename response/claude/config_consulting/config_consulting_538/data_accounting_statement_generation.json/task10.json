The data doesn't show any purchases or disposals of fixed assets during the period, only the initial value and subsequent depreciation entries.\n\nTherefore, the final values are:\n- Initial non-current assets: 5,000,000.00\n- Ending non-current assets: 4,908,496.94\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '4908496.94'} }\n```",
