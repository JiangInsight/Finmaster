These would typically be labeled as:\n- Capital contributions\n- Additional paid-in capital\n- Owner investments\n- Capital withdrawals\n- Return of capital\n\nAfter reviewing all transactions, I don't see any additional capital injections or withdrawals. The transactions after the initial deposits relate to:\n- Purchases\n- Sales\n- Expenses\n- Depreciation\n- Interest receivables\n- Cash transfers\n\n## Step 3: Calculate final paid-in capital\nSince there were no additional capital contributions or withdrawals identified, the paid-in capital remains unchanged from its initial value.\n\nInitial paid-in capital: 13,000,000.00\nFinal paid-in capital: 13,000,000.00\n\nTherefore, the paid-in capital item in the balance sheet shows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
