Let me approach this step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the initial bank deposit value\nLooking at the transactions, I can see an initial entry:\n```\nInitial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0\n```\nThis clearly indicates the initial bank deposit amount is 5,000,000.\n\n## Step 2: Track all transactions that affect the bank deposits\nI need to identify all transactions that would increase or decrease the bank deposit balance:\n\n### Types of transactions that affect bank deposits:\n1. Initial bank deposit (already identified as 5,000,000)\n2. Purchases paid via \"Bank Transfer\"\n3. Sales received via bank methods\n4. Cash to bank transfers\n5. Bank-related expenses\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the changes to bank deposits\n\nLet me identify all bank-related transactions:\n\n### Bank outflows (decreases):\n- Purchase20231231001: 100,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231002: 60,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231003: 15,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231005: 100,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231007: 5,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231008: 40,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231011: 10,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231012: 40,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231021: 40,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231028: 3,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231030: 2,000 (Bank Transfer)\n\n### Bank inflows (increases):\n- Cash to bank transfers (none visible in this dataset)\n- Sales received via bank (none specifically marked as bank deposits)\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final bank deposit amount\n\nStarting amount: 5,000,000\n\nTotal bank outflows: \n100,000 + 60,000 + 15,000 + 100,000 + 5,000 + 40,000 + 10,000 + 40,000 + 40,000 + 3,000 + 2,000 = 415,000\n\nFinal amount: 5,000,000 - 415,000 = 4,585,000\n\n## Double-check\nLet me verify if there are any transactions I might have missed:\n- There are no \"Cash to bank transfer\" transactions in this dataset\n- No sales are specifically marked as being deposited in the bank\n- The purchases marked \"Bank Transfer\" are the only explicit bank outflows\n\nTherefore, the final bank deposit amount is 4,585,000.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Bank Deposits Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Bank Deposits End Value': '4585000.00'} }\n```",
