In cash flow statements, these would be capital expenditures representing purchases of long-term assets.\n\nLet me examine the data carefully:\n\n1. Looking through the transactions, I need to find entries specifically related to fixed asset purchases.\n\n2. In the provided data, I need to search for transactions with types like \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar designations that would indicate capital expenditures.\n\n3. Looking at the transaction types, I don't see a specific \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" type, but I should examine all purchase transactions carefully to see if any represent fixed assets.\n\n4. Since this is for a cash flow statement, I need to find actual cash outflows for fixed asset acquisitions during the period.\n\nAfter reviewing all transactions, I don't see any explicit fixed asset purchases in the data marked as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or clearly identified as capital expenditures. \n\nThe initial transaction shows \"Fixed Assets\" of 5,000,000, but this appears to be an initial balance rather than a purchase during the period.\n\nThe transactions mainly show purchases of services (Basic Consulting, Standard Consulting, Premium Consulting, and Enterprise Solution), expenses, sales, and other operational transactions, but I don't see specific fixed asset acquisitions.\n\nSince I don't see any explicit fixed asset purchases in the transactions data, the amount would be 0. However, I should double-check carefully to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nActually, looking at the purchases more carefully, I notice that these all appear to be service-related purchases rather than fixed assets. Fixed assets would typically be physical items like equipment, buildings, vehicles, or other long-term tangible assets.\n\nTherefore, the purchase of fixed assets in the cash flow statement would be 0 based on the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '0'} }\n```",
