Let me verify if there are any other transactions that affect the cash balance that I might have missed.\n\nLooking back at the data, I don't see any specific deposits or withdrawals beyond the initial deposits, purchases, expenses, and sales transactions. The data doesn't explicitly show any additional transfers between cash and bank accounts.\n\nActually, I noticed that I should check for transfers between cash and bank, which don't affect the total cash and equivalents, but should be tracked.\n\nI see that there aren't any transfers between cash and bank accounts in this dataset, unlike the example dataset which had such transfers.\n\nBased on my analysis, the final ending cash and cash equivalents balance is $8,177,656.29.\n\nWait, let me recheck the classification of the transactions to ensure I've captured everything correctly.\n\nAfter reviewing the data more carefully, the ending balance of cash and cash equivalents is $8,177,656.29.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Ending Balance': '8177656.29'} }\n```",
