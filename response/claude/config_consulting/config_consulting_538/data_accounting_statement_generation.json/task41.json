This means there were no decreases to accounts payable during this period.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the net change in accounts payable.\n\nSince we only have increases in accounts payable and no decreases, the net change is:\n816,000.00 - 0 = 816,000.00\n\nTherefore, the increase in accounts payable is 816,000.00, which will be reported in the cash flow statement.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '816000.00'} }\n```",
