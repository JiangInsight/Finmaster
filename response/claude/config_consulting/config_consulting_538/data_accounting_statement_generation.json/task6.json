Inventory\n5. Interest receivable\n6. Other current assets\n\n### Step 1: Identify the initial values as of 2023-12-31\n\nFrom the data:\n- Initial cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n- Initial bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Other initial current assets: 0 (no inventory or receivables at the start)\n\nInitial total current assets = 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 8,000,000.00\n\n### Step 2: Track the changes in current assets\n\n#### Cash flow tracking:\n- Initial cash: 3,000,000.00\n- Cash outflows: Expenses, purchases paid in cash, cash to bank transfers\n- Cash inflows: Sales paid in cash\n\n#### Bank deposit tracking:\n- Initial bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Bank outflows: Purchases paid via bank transfer\n- Bank inflows: Cash to bank transfers\n\n#### Accounts receivable tracking:\n- Initial accounts receivable: 0\n- Increases: Sales with \"Account Receviable\" as receive_method\n- Decreases: Payments received on account (none explicitly shown)\n\n#### Interest receivable tracking:\n- Initial interest receivable: 0\n- Changes: All interest receivable transactions\n\n#### Inventory tracking:\n- Initial inventory: 0\n- Increases: Purchases of products\n- Decreases: Cost of sales\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the final current assets balance\n\nLet me calculate each component:\n\n1. Cash balance:\n   - Initial: 3,000,000.00\n   - Net flow after all transactions: -1,922,082.70\n   - Final: 1,077,917.30\n\n2. Bank balance:\n   - Initial: 5,000,000.00\n   - Net flow after all transactions: -880,000.00\n   - Final: 4,120,000.00\n\n3. Accounts receivable:\n   - Initial: 0\n   - Net increase: 1,645,958.10\n   - Final: 1,645,958.10\n\n4. Interest receivable:\n   - Initial: 0\n   - Net increase: 12,931.07\n   - Final: 12,931.07\n\n5. Inventory:\n   - Initial: 0\n   - Net increase after purchases and sales: 1,100,000.00\n   - Final: 1,100,000.00\n\nTotal current assets at end = 1,077,917.30 + 4,120,000.00 + 1,645,958.10 + 12,931.07 + 1,100,000.00 = 7,956,806.47\n\n### Final calculation\n\nInitial current assets: 8,000,000.00\nFinal current assets: 7,956,806.47\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Total Current Assets End Value': '7956806.47'}}\n```",
