                        "content": "I'll solve this by analyzing the transactions and creating a cash flow statement step by step.\n\nStep 1: Let's identify the initial balances.\n- Initial cash: 3,000,000.00\n- Initial bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Total beginning cash and cash equivalents: 8,000,000.00\n- Initial fixed assets: 5,000,000.00\n\nStep 2: Calculate net profit.\nI need to aggregate sales, purchases, expenses, interest, and depreciation to determine net profit.\n\nIncome from sales:\n- Total sales amount: 2,640,968.29\n- Total cost of goods sold: 1,060,000.00\n- Gross profit: 1,580,968.29\n\nExpenses:\n- Administrative expenses: 149,241.30\n- Sales expenses: 293,273.09\n- Financial expenses: 41,362.08\n- Depreciation: 91,503.06\n- Total expenses: 575,379.53\n\nNet profit = Gross profit - Total expenses = 1,580,968.29 - 575,379.53 = 1,005,588.76\n\nStep 3: Analyze changes in operating assets and liabilities.\n\n(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable:\n- Total accounts receivable created: 1,863,795.87\n- Total accounts receivable collected: 0 (no payments received for AR)\n- Net change: -1,863,795.87\n\n(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable:\n- Total interest receivable: 12,647.55\n- Net change: -12,647.55\n\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory:\n- Total inventory purchased: 1,060,000.00\n- Total inventory sold (COGS): 1,060,000.00\n- Net change: 0.00\n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Accounts Payable:\n- Total accounts payable created: 501,000.00\n- Total accounts payable paid: 0 (no payments made for AP)\n- Net change: 501,000.00\n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Tax Payable:\n- Total tax collected on sales: 132,048.41\n- Net change: 132,048.41\n\nStep 4: Calculate net cash flow from operating activities.\nNet cash flow from operating activities = Net profit + Depreciation + Changes in operating assets and liabilities\n= 1,005,588.76 + 91,503.06 - 1,863,795.87 - 12,647.55 + 0.00 + 501,000.00 + 132,048.41\n= -146,303.19\n\nStep 5: Analyze investing activities.\nPurchase of Fixed Assets:\n- Initial fixed assets: 5,000,000.00 (this was part of the initial balances, not a cash outflow during the period)\n- Net cash flow from investing activities: 0.00\n\nStep 6: Calculate the ending cash balance.\nBeginning Balance: 8,000,000.00\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -146,303.19\nNet Cash Flow from Investing Activities: 0.00\nEnding Balance: 7,853,696.81\nNet Increase: -146,303.19\n\nNow I'll format the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Net Profit\": \"1005588.76\", \"Depreciation\": \"91503.06\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-1863795.87\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-12647.55\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"0.00\", \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"501000.00\", \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"132048.41\", \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-146303.19\", \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"0.00\", \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": \"0.00\", \"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\", \"Ending Balance\": \"7853696.81\", \"Net Increase\": \"-146303.19\"}}\n```\n\nLet me double-check by verifying the cash movements directly:\n- Initial cash + bank: 8,000,000.00\n- Cash inflows from sales: 776,242.20\n- Cash outflows for expenses: 484,545.41\n- Cash outflows for purchases: 438,000.00\n- Net cash movement: 776,242.20 - 484,545.41 - 438,000.00 = -146,303.21 (slight rounding difference)\n\nThis confirms my calculation, so the final answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Net Profit\": \"1005588.76\", \"Depreciation\": \"91503.06\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-1863795.87\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-12647.55\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"0.00\", \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"501000.00\", \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"132048.41\", \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-146303.19\", \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"0.00\", \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": \"0.00\", \"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\", \"Ending Balance\": \"7853696.81\", \"Net Increase\": \"-146303.19\"}}",
