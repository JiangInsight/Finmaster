The \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" line item shows how this amount has changed during the period.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement provided:\n- The line \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" shows a value of \"-2149792.45\"\n- The negative sign indicates an increase in accounts receivable (more money is owed to the company)\n- Since we're looking for a decrease, and this shows an increase, the value is -2149792.45\n\nThis is the value we need to extract as it represents the change (in this case an increase) in amounts owed to the entity for goods sold on credit.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2149792.45'}}\n```",
