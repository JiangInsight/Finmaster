This represents tax obligations that have been incurred but not yet paid by the company, which is exactly what I'm looking for.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Initial value of Taxes Payable (as of 2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End value of Taxes Payable (as of 2024-02-05): 143478.02\n\nTherefore, the tax accrued but not yet paid started at 0.00 and ended at 143478.02 for the period covered by this balance sheet.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '143478.02'}}\n```",
