Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit - This would be \"Accounts Receivable\" from the Balance Sheet\n2. Financing costs incurred for production and operation - This would be \"Financial Expenses\" from the Income Statement\n3. Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment - This would be \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" from the Cash Flow Statement\n\nLet me extract these values:\n\n1. From the Balance Sheet: \"Accounts Receivable\" has an end amount of 2149792.45\n2. From the Income Statement: \"Financial Expenses\" has an amount of 50283.07\n3. From the Cash Flow Statement: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" has an amount of 0.00\n\nTherefore, my solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2149792.45', 'value2': '50283.07', 'value3': '0.00'}}\n```",
