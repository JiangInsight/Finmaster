In the operating activities section, I see:\n\n```\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -112000.00 | 2024-02-05\n```\n\nThe negative value of -112000.00 indicates an increase in inventory (since it's labeled as \"(Increase) Decrease\"). \n\nSince we're looking for a reduction (decrease) in inventory, and this value shows an increase, we need to be careful. The task is asking for the value of reduction, but the data shows an increase.\n\nIn this case, there was no reduction in inventory - instead, there was an increase of $112,000. Since there was no reduction, the answer would be $0. However, the question specifically asks for the value of the reduction, which is represented in the statement as -$112,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-112000.00'}}\n```",
