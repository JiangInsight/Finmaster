This refers to the increase in accounts payable.\n\nLooking at the financial statements:\n\n1. From the balance sheet, I can see that Accounts Payable increased from an initial amount of $0.00 (on 2023-12-31) to $485,000.00 (on 2024-02-05).\n\n2. This is confirmed in the cash flow statement, which shows \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" of $485,000.00.\n\nThe accounts payable represents the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit. Since it started at zero and increased to $485,000.00, this is the specific value I need to extract.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '485000.00'} }\n```",
