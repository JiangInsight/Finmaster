Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services to customers\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\nFor the first item, this typically refers to \"Selling Expenses\" in the income statement, which are costs associated with securing customer orders and delivering goods/services.\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Selling Expenses: 309942.03\n\nFor the second item, this refers to cash outflows for acquiring fixed assets, which is found in the cash flow statement under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 0.00\n\nTherefore, the two values I need to extract are:\n- value1: 309942.03 (Selling Expenses)\n- value2: 0.00 (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '309942.03', 'value2': '0.00'} }\n```",
