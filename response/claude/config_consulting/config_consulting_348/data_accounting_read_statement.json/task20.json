This is because Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) measures the direct costs attributable to the production of goods sold by a company, which includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the goods.\n\nFrom the income statement for February 5, 2024, I can see that:\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 1249000.00\n\nTherefore, the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is 1249000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1249000.00'}}\n```",
