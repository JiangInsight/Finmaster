In accounting, accumulated depreciation represents the cumulative amount of depreciation expense that has been recognized over time.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is shown with an initial value of 0.00 on 2023-12-31\n- \"Accumulated Depreciation\" has an end value of 91509.25 on 2024-02-05\n\nThis indicates that depreciation expense of 91509.25 was recorded during this period. Since this is an expense item that appears in the statement of profit or loss, this meets the criteria of the task.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '91509.25'} }\n```",
