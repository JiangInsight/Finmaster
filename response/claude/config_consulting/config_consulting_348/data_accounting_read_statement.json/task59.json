The net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement carefully:\n\n### Balance Sheet\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, I see \"Interest Receivable\" with an end amount of 14,575.80. This represents interest that has accrued but has not yet been received.\n\n### Cash Flow Statement\nIn the Cash Flow Statement, I can see \"Net Increase\" in Cash and Cash Equivalents with a value of -650,630.22. This represents the net change in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\n### Income Statement\nThe Income Statement shows \"Interest Income\" of 14,575.80, which matches the Interest Receivable on the Balance Sheet, confirming this is the accrued interest.\n\nTherefore:\n- Value 1 (interest accrued but not yet received): 14,575.80\n- Value 2 (net addition in cash and cash equivalents): -650,630.22\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '14575.80', 'value2': '-650630.22'} }\n```",
