Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities (from Cash Flow Statement)\n2. Taxes accrued but not yet paid (from Balance Sheet)\n3. Total income arising from ordinary activities (from Income Statement)\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- \"Taxes Payable\" represents taxes accrued but not yet paid: 143478.02\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- \"Total Revenue\" represents the total income arising from ordinary activities: 2869560.42\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" represents the net amount of cash generated from operating activities: -650630.22\n\nNow I'll compile these values in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '143478.02', 'value2': '2869560.42', 'value3': '-650630.22'}}\n```",
