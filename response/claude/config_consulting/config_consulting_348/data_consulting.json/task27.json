                        "content": "I need to calculate three financial ratios based on the provided financial statements:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio (also known as Turnover Ratio)\n3. Quick Ratio\n\nLet me solve each one by one:\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\nThis ratio compares the cash flow from operating activities to the net income.\n\nFormula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -650,630.22\n- Net Profit = 905,750.76\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = -650,630.22 / 905,750.76 = -0.72\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company is using its current assets to generate revenue.\n\nFormula: Total Revenue / Average Current Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 2,869,560.42\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Current Assets = 8,000,000.00\n- End Current Assets = 9,625,738.03\n- Average Current Assets = (8,000,000.00 + 9,625,738.03) / 2 = 8,812,869.02\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = 2,869,560.42 / 8,812,869.02 = 0.33\n\n### 3. Quick Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n\nFormula: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = 9,625,738.03\n- Inventory = 112,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 628,478.02\n\nQuick Ratio = (9,625,738.03 - 112,000.00) / 628,478.02 = 9,513,738.03 / 628,478.02 = 15.14\n\nNow I can present my answer in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.72', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.33', 'Quick Ratio': '15.14'}}\n```",
