Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio:\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -$650,630.22\n   - Current Liabilities: $628,478.02\n   - Ratio = -650,630.22 / 628,478.02 = -1.04\n\n2. Debt to Equity Ratio:\n   - Total Liabilities: $628,478.02\n   - Total Equity: $13,905,750.76\n   - Ratio = 628,478.02 / 13,905,750.76 = 0.05\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio:\n   - Net Sales (Revenue): $2,869,560.42\n   - Average Total Assets: ($13,000,000.00 + $14,534,228.78) / 2 = $13,767,114.39\n   - Ratio = 2,869,560.42 / 13,767,114.39 = 0.21\n\n4. Quick Ratio:\n   - Quick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = $9,625,738.03 - $112,000.00 = $9,513,738.03\n   - Current Liabilities: $628,478.02\n   - Ratio = 9,513,738.03 / 628,478.02 = 15.14\n\n5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -$650,630.22\n   - Current Liabilities: $628,478.02\n   - Ratio = -650,630.22 / 628,478.02 = -1.04 (same as Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio)\n\n6. Return on Equity (ROE):\n   - Net Income: $905,750.76\n   - Average Shareholders' Equity: ($13,000,000.00 + $13,905,750.76) / 2 = $13,452,875.38\n   - ROE = 905,750.76 / 13,452,875.38 = 0.0673 or 6.73%\n\n7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:\n   - Net Credit Sales (assuming all sales are credit): $2,869,560.42\n   - Average Accounts Receivable: ($0 + $2,149,792.45) / 2 = $1,074,896.23\n   - Ratio = 2,869,560.42 / 1,074,896.23 = 2.67\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.04', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.21', 'Quick Ratio': '15.14', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.04', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '6.73%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.67'} }\n```",
