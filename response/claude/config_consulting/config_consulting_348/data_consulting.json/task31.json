                        "content": "I'll calculate the requested financial ratios step by step based on the provided financial statements.\n\n## 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\n- Formula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n- Net Credit Sales = Main Business Revenue = $2,869,560.42\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2 = ($0 + $2,149,792.45) / 2 = $1,074,896.23\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $2,869,560.42 / $1,074,896.23 = 2.67\n\n## 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to cover current liabilities with operating cash flow.\n- Formula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n- Operating Cash Flow = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$650,630.22\n- Current Liabilities = $628,478.02\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -$650,630.22 / $628,478.02 = -1.04\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio I just calculated: -1.04\n\n## 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n- Formula: Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n- Net Sales = Main Business Revenue = $2,869,560.42\n- Average Total Assets = (Beginning Assets + Ending Assets) / 2 = ($13,000,000 + $14,534,228.78) / 2 = $13,767,114.39\n- Total Asset Turnover Ratio = $2,869,560.42 / $13,767,114.39 = 0.21\n\n## 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures a company's financial leverage.\n- Formula: Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $628,478.02\n- Total Shareholders' Equity = Total Owner's Equity = $13,905,750.76\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = $628,478.02 / $13,905,750.76 = 0.05\n\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.67', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-1.04', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.04', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.21', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05'}}",
