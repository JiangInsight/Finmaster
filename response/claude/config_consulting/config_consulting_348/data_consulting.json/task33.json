                        "content": "I'll calculate each of these financial ratios step by step based on the provided financial statements.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to cover its current liabilities with its operating cash flow.\nFormula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the statements:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -650,630.22\n- Total Current Liabilities = 628,478.02\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -650,630.22 / 628,478.02 = -1.04\n\n## 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to repay its debt with its operating cash flow.\nFormula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Liabilities\n\nFrom the statements:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -650,630.22\n- Total Liabilities = 628,478.02 (since there are only current liabilities)\n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -650,630.22 / 628,478.02 = -1.04\n\n## 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period.\nFormula: Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nFrom the statements:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 1,249,000.00\n- Beginning Inventory = 0.00\n- Ending Inventory = 112,000.00\n- Average Inventory = (0.00 + 112,000.00) / 2 = 56,000.00\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 1,249,000.00 / 56,000.00 = 22.30\n\n## 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures a company's financial leverage.\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n\nFrom the statements:\n- Total Liabilities = 628,478.02\n- Total Owner's Equity = 13,905,750.76\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 628,478.02 / 13,905,750.76 = 0.05\n\n## 5. Quick Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory.\nFormula: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the statements:\n- Current Assets = 9,625,738.03\n- Inventory = 112,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 628,478.02\n\nQuick Ratio = (9,625,738.03 - 112,000.00) / 628,478.02 = 9,513,738.03 / 628,478.02 = 15.14\n\n## 6. Current Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations.\nFormula: Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the statements:\n- Current Assets = 9,625,738.03\n- Current Liabilities = 628,478.02\n\nCurrent Ratio = 9,625,738.03 / 628,478.02 = 15.32\n\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.04', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.04', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '22.30', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05', 'Quick Ratio': '15.14', 'Current Ratio': '15.32'}}",
