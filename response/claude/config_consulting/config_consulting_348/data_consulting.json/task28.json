                        "content": "I'll solve this step by step, calculating the three financial ratios based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures what proportion of a company's assets is financed by debt.\n\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = $628,478.02 (Total Current Liabilities)\n- Total Assets = $14,534,228.78\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $628,478.02 / $14,534,228.78 = 0.0432\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\nThe Gross Profit Margin measures the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold.\n\nFormula: Gross Profit / Total Revenue × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = $1,620,560.42\n- Total Revenue = $2,869,560.42\n\nGross Profit Margin = ($1,620,560.42 / $2,869,560.42) × 100% = 56.47%\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThe Operating Cash Flow Ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow generated from operations.\n\nFormula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the financial statements:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$650,630.22\n- Total Current Liabilities = $628,478.02\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$650,630.22 / $628,478.02 = -1.04\n\nNow I'll present the solution in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04', 'Gross Profit Margin': '56.47%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.04'}}\n```",
