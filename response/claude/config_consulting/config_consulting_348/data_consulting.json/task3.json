                        "content": "I need to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio based on the balance sheet provided. The Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated by dividing total liabilities by total assets.\n\nStep 1: Identify the total liabilities from the balance sheet.\n- From the balance sheet, I can see \"Total Current Liabilities\" at the end of the period is $628,478.02\n- There are no long-term liabilities mentioned, so the total liabilities are $628,478.02\n\nStep 2: Identify the total assets from the balance sheet.\n- From the balance sheet, \"Total Assets\" at the end of the period is $14,534,228.78\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio.\n- Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n- Debt to Asset Ratio = $628,478.02 / $14,534,228.78\n- Debt to Asset Ratio = 0.04324187... or approximately 0.04\n\nTherefore, the Debt to Asset Ratio is 0.04, which means that about 4% of the company's assets are financed by debt.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04'} }\n```",
