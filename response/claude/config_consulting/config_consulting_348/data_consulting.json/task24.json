Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit\n\nLet me solve these step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Debt to Asset Ratio\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $628,478.02\n- Total Assets = $14,534,228.78\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $628,478.02 / $14,534,228.78 = 0.0432 ≈ 0.04\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\nFrom the cash flow statement and income statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$650,630.22\n- Net Profit = $905,750.76\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = -$650,630.22 / $905,750.76 = -0.7183 ≈ -0.72\n\nThe negative ratio indicates that while the company is profitable, it's consuming rather than generating cash from its operations.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.72'}}\n```",
