This ratio shows the proportion of the company's debt relative to its equity.\n\nThe formula for Debt to Equity Ratio is:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet (using end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = $628,478.02\n- Total Owner's Equity = $13,905,750.76\n\nSince there are no other liabilities listed beyond current liabilities, the total liabilities is equal to the total current liabilities.\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $628,478.02 / $13,905,750.76 = 0.045196 â‰ˆ 0.05\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the Debt to Equity Ratio is 0.05.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05'}}\n```",
