                        "content": "I need to calculate several financial ratios based on the provided financial statements. Let me work through each one step by step.\n\n## 1. Current Ratio\nThe current ratio is calculated as: Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = $9,625,738.03\n- Current Liabilities = $628,478.02\n\nCurrent Ratio = $9,625,738.03 ÷ $628,478.02 = 15.32\n\n## 2. Quick Ratio\nThe quick ratio is calculated as: (Current Assets - Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = $9,625,738.03\n- Inventory = $112,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = $628,478.02\n\nQuick Ratio = ($9,625,738.03 - $112,000.00) ÷ $628,478.02 = $9,513,738.03 ÷ $628,478.02 = 15.14\n\n## 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\nThe debt to asset ratio is calculated as: Total Liabilities ÷ Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = $628,478.02 (only current liabilities in this case)\n- Total Assets = $14,534,228.78\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $628,478.02 ÷ $14,534,228.78 = 0.04\n\n## 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThe debt to equity ratio is calculated as: Total Liabilities ÷ Total Owner's Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = $628,478.02\n- Total Owner's Equity = $13,905,750.76\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $628,478.02 ÷ $13,905,750.76 = 0.05\n\n## 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nThe cash flow to debt ratio is calculated as: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities ÷ Total Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$650,630.22\n- Total Liabilities = $628,478.02\n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -$650,630.22 ÷ $628,478.02 = -1.04\n\nNow, I'll format the answer according to the required JSON format, rounding to 2 decimal places:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '15.32', 'Quick Ratio': '15.14', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.04'}}\n```",
