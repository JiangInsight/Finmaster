Current Assets as of 2024-02-05: $9,625,738.03\n2. Inventory as of 2024-02-05: $112,000.00\n3. Current Liabilities as of 2024-02-05: $628,478.02\n\nNow I'll calculate the Quick Ratio:\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\nQuick Ratio = ($9,625,738.03 - $112,000.00) / $628,478.02\nQuick Ratio = $9,513,738.03 / $628,478.02\nQuick Ratio = 15.14\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 15.14\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '15.14'} }\n```",
