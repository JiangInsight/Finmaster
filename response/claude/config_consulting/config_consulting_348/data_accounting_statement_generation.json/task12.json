I'll examine all purchase transactions that use the \"Account Payable\" payment method.\n\n## Step 1: Find all purchases with \"Account Payable\" payment method\nLet me go through the transaction data and identify all purchases with \"Account Payable\" as the payment method:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 60,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable, 2023-12-31)\n- Purchase20231231006: 60,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable, 2023-12-31)\n- Purchase20231231007: 10,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable, 2023-12-31)\n- Purchase20231231011: 300,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable, 2023-12-31)\n- Purchase20231231014: 2,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable, 2023-12-31)\n- Purchase20231231016: 40,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable, 2023-12-31)\n- Purchase20231231021: 3,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable, 2023-12-31)\n- Purchase20231231022: 10,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable, 2023-12-31)\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the initial accounts payable\nSince these are all dated 2023-12-31, the initial accounts payable would be the sum of these amounts.\n\nInitial accounts payable = 60,000.00 + 60,000.00 + 10,000.00 + 300,000.00 + 2,000.00 + 40,000.00 + 3,000.00 + 10,000.00 = 485,000.00\n\n## Step 3: Check for any account payable transactions after the initial date\nLooking through the data, I don't see any additional purchases with \"Account Payable\" payment method after 2023-12-31. I also don't see any payments made toward these accounts payable.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final accounts payable\nSince there are no additional accounts payable created and no payments made toward the existing accounts payable, the ending balance would be the same as the initial balance.\n\nFinal accounts payable = 485,000.00\n\n## Step 5: Format the answer\nInitial Value: 485,000.00\nEnd Value: 485,000.00\n\nLet me present this in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"485000.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"485000.00\"}}\n```",
