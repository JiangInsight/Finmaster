First, let's find the initial fixed assets value:\n   - Transaction \"Initial20231231001\" with type \"Fixed Assets\" shows an initial value of 5000000.0\n\n2. Next, I need to check if there are any additional fixed asset purchases or disposals:\n   - Looking through the transactions, I don't see any specific \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" type entries\n   - There are no asset_name or asset_type columns with values in the data\n   - No transactions specifically indicate fixed asset additions or disposals\n\n3. I'll also check for depreciation that affects fixed assets:\n   - There are two depreciation entries:\n     - \"Depreciation20240101001\" with amount 45756.35 on 2024-01-01\n     - \"Depreciation20240201002\" with amount 45752.899999999994 on 2024-02-01\n   - However, depreciation doesn't change the gross fixed asset value, it only affects net book value through accumulated depreciation\n\nSince I don't see any transactions that would change the gross fixed asset value (no purchases or disposals of fixed assets), the fixed asset amount should remain the same from initial to final.\n\nTherefore:\n- Fixed Assets Initial Value = 5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets End Value = 5,000,000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Fixed Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Fixed Assets End Value': '5000000.00'} }\n```",
