Let me find all of them:\n\n- Depreciation20240101001: Depreciation on 2024-01-01 for 45,756.35\n- Depreciation20240201002: Depreciation on 2024-02-01 for 45,752.90\n\n## Step 3: Determine the initial value\nSince the first depreciation transaction occurs on 2024-01-01, and there are no prior depreciation entries, the initial accumulated depreciation value would be 0.00 as of 2023-12-31.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the end value\nThe end value would be the sum of all depreciation amounts:\n45,756.35 + 45,752.90 = 91,509.25\n\nHowever, I need to carefully check if this is the real end of the period or if there might be more depreciation entries.\n\nAfter reviewing the data, I can see that the data spans from 2023-12-31 to 2024-02-05. The two depreciation entries I found occur on 2024-01-01 and 2024-02-01, with each representing a monthly depreciation.\n\nGiven that the data ends on 2024-02-05, the accumulated depreciation as of the end of this period would be the sum of these two entries: 91,509.25.\n\n## Step 5: Format the result\nNow I'll present the result in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accumulated Depreciation End Value': '91509.25'} }\n```\n\nActually, let me carefully review the data again to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nOn second check, I notice that the correct values are:\n- Depreciation20240101001: 45,756.35\n- Depreciation20240201002: 45,752.90\n\nSo the end value is indeed 91,509.25. This represents the total accumulated depreciation by the end of the period covered in the data.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accumulated Depreciation End Value': '91509.25'}}",
