Let me try once more with a different approach:\n\nLet me sum all the sales tax amounts systematically:\n```\n2,118.29 + 10,510.19 = 12,628.48\n+ 714.14 + 2,897.35 + 103.73 = 16,343.70\n+ 489.44 + 148.59 = 16,981.73\n+ 108.03 + 2,193.99 = 19,283.75\n+ 2,688.52 = 21,972.27\n+ 489.74 = 22,462.01\n+ 539.57 + 2,076.09 = 25,077.67\n+ 11,012.82 + 2,999.61 + 622.49 = 39,712.59\n+ 2,866.06 + 12,732.74 = 55,311.39\n+ 10,118.06 = 65,429.45\n+ 484.4 = 65,913.85\n+ 11,645.83 + 9,430.35 = 86,990.03\n+ 2,403.95 = 89,393.98\n+ 600.31 = 89,994.29\n+ 2,630.00 + 10,927.59 + 2,497.59 = 106,049.47\n+ 554.8 + 2,004.8 = 108,609.07\n+ 149.71 + 671.71 = 109,430.49\n+ 2,781.94 = 112,212.43\n+ 2,828.89 + 696.08 + 13,846.00 = 129,583.40\n+ 103.08 = 129,686.48\n+ 9,767.16 + 685.47 + 548.45 = 140,687.56\n+ 132.94 + 142.12 + 136.74 = 141,099.36\n+ 2,240.80 + 137.86 = 143,478.02\n```\n\nLet me redo the calculation one more time to confirm:\n```\n2,118.29 + 10,510.19 + 714.14 + 2,897.35 + 103.73 = 16,343.70\n+ 489.44 + 148.59 + 108.03 + 2,193.99 + 2,688.52 = 21,972.27\n+ 489.74 + 539.57 + 2,076.09 = 25,077.67\n+ 11,012.82 + 2,999.61 + 622.49 = 39,712.59\n+ 2,866.06 + 12,732.74 + 10,118.06 = 65,429.45\n+ 484.40 + 11,645.83 + 9,430.35 = 86,990.03\n+ 2,403.95 + 600.31 = 89,994.29\n+ 2,630.00 + 10,927.59 + 2,497.59 = 106,049.47\n+ 554.80 + 2,004.80 + 149.71 + 671.71 = 109,430.49\n+ 2,781.94 + 2,828.89 + 696.08 + 13,846.00 = 129,583.40\n+ 103.08 + 9,767.16 + 685.47 + 548.45 = 140,687.56\n+ 132.94 + 142.12 + 136.74 + 2,240.80 + 137.86 = 143,478.02\n```\n\nSo the final sum of all tax amounts is $143,478.02.\n\nLet me check the solution from the example. They show 'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '271550.92'. This is quite different from my calculation. Let me recheck my approach.\n\nThe key difference could be that in the example, they might be considering not just the tax collected on sales (which is what I summed), but also other factors affecting tax payable.\n\nLooking at the explanation provided in the example problem, the focus is on \"final tax payable item in the cash flow statement\". In a cash flow statement, the increase in tax payable represents the difference between taxes accrued and taxes paid.\n\nLet me reconsider this calculation, looking at the total tax amount from all transactions in the data.\n\nSince the data only shows tax amounts collected on sales, and there aren't explicit tax payment transactions, the total tax payable would be the sum of all tax amounts from sales, which is $143,478.02.\n\nHowever, there's a significant difference between my calculation and the example solution ($271,550.92). This likely means we need to consider some other transactions or make additional adjustments.\n\nGiven the limitations of the transaction data and the significant difference with the example solution, I'll provide what I've calculated based on the information available, which is the sum of all tax amounts from sales.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '143478.02'} }",
