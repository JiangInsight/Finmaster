Let me work through this step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Understand what we're looking for\nThe \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" line item in a cash flow statement represents the net change in inventory value during the period. To calculate this:\n- A positive value means inventory decreased (resources were converted to cash)\n- A negative value means inventory increased (cash was used to build inventory)\n\n## Step 2: Identify inventory-related transactions\nIn this dataset, the \"Purchase\" transactions for products/services will add to inventory, while \"Sale\" transactions will reduce inventory (through cost of goods sold).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the net inventory change\nI need to:\n1. Sum all inventory purchases\n2. Subtract the cost of goods sold from sales\n\n### Analyzing Purchase Transactions:\nLooking at all Purchase transactions from the data, I'll add up the inventory purchases:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 60,000.00 (Premium Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231002: 100,000.00 (Enterprise Solution)\n- Purchase20231231003: 3,000.00 (Basic Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231004: 5,000.00 (Standard Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231005: 15,000.00 (Standard Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231006: 60,000.00 (Premium Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231007: 10,000.00 (Standard Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231008: 300,000.00 (Enterprise Solution)\n- Purchase20231231009: 20,000.00 (Premium Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231010: 5,000.00 (Standard Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231011: 300,000.00 (Enterprise Solution)\n- Purchase20231231012: 60,000.00 (Premium Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231013: 200,000.00 (Enterprise Solution)\n- Purchase20231231014: 2,000.00 (Basic Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231015: 3,000.00 (Basic Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231016: 40,000.00 (Premium Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231017: 10,000.00 (Standard Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231018: 15,000.00 (Standard Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231019: 60,000.00 (Premium Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231020: 20,000.00 (Premium Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231021: 3,000.00 (Basic Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231022: 10,000.00 (Standard Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231023: 60,000.00 (Premium Consulting)\n\nTotal Purchases = 1,361,000.00\n\n### Cost of Goods Sold from Sales:\nFor each sale, I need to look at the cost_amount column, which represents the inventory cost of the items sold:\n\nAdding up all the cost_amount values from the Sale transactions:\n- Sale20240103002: 20,000.00\n- Sale20240103003: 100,000.00\n- Sale20240105007: 5,000.00\n- Sale20240105008: 20,000.00\n- Sale20240105009: 1,000.00\n- Sale20240106010: 5,000.00\n- Sale20240106011: 1,000.00\n- Sale20240107013: 1,000.00\n- Sale20240107014: 20,000.00\n- Sale20240108015: 20,000.00\n- Sale20240112018: 5,000.00\n- Sale20240115020: 5,000.00\n- Sale20240115021: 20,000.00\n- Sale20240117024: 100,000.00\n- Sale20240117025: 20,000.00\n- Sale20240117026: 5,000.00\n- Sale20240118028: 20,000.00\n- Sale20240118029: 100,000.00\n- Sale20240119031: 100,000.00\n- Sale20240120033: 5,000.00\n- Sale20240121035: 100,000.00\n- Sale20240121036: 100,000.00\n- Sale20240123039: 20,000.00\n- Sale20240124041: 5,000.00\n- Sale20240126044: 20,000.00\n- Sale20240126045: 100,000.00\n- Sale20240126046: 20,000.00\n- Sale20240128050: 5,000.00\n- Sale20240128051: 20,000.00\n- Sale20240129053: 1,000.00\n- Sale20240129054: 5,000.00\n- Sale20240130055: 20,000.00\n- Sale20240131057: 20,000.00\n- Sale20240131058: 5,000.00\n- Sale20240131059: 100,000.00\n- Sale20240201061: 1,000.00\n- Sale20240202063: 100,000.00\n- Sale20240202064: 5,000.00\n- Sale20240202065: 5,000.00\n- Sale20240203066: 1,000.00\n- Sale20240203067: 1,000.00\n- Sale20240203068: 1,000.00\n- Sale20240204069: 20,000.00\n- Sale20240204070: 1,000.00\n\nTotal Cost of Goods Sold = 1,343,000.00\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\n\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory = Cost of Goods Sold - Purchases\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory = 1,343,000.00 - 1,361,000.00 = -18,000.00\n\nA negative value means that inventory increased during the period. This makes sense because the company purchased more inventory than it sold.\n\nTherefore, the (Increase) Decrease in Inventory value is -18,000.00.\n\nWait, I should verify this calculation. Let me double-check the numbers:\n\nActually, I see that I need to format the number to exactly match the expected format in the example, which shows \"'-5090000.00'\".\n\nThe final answer should be formatted with the negative sign and decimal precision.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-18000.00'}}\n```",
