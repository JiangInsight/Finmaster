Let me work through this systematically, categorizing each type of transaction to calculate the required financial metrics.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the Sales Transactions\nFirst, I'll identify all \"Sale\" transactions to calculate revenue.\n\nLooking through the data, transactions with \"Sale\" in the type field represent revenue. I need to sum all these amounts to get the Main Business Revenue.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Cost of Goods Sold\nFor each sale, there is a \"cost_amount\" field that represents the cost of the goods or services sold. I'll sum these to get the Cost of Goods Sold.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Expenses by Category\nI need to categorize and sum all expense transactions:\n- Administrative Expenses: All \"Administrative Expenses\" type transactions\n- Selling Expenses: All \"Sales Expenses\" type transactions\n- Depreciation: All \"Depreciation\" type transactions\n- Financial Expenses: All \"Financial Expenses\" type transactions\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Interest Income\nAll \"Interest Receivables\" transactions represent interest income.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate Tax\nThe tax amount for each sale is in the \"tax_amount\" field. I'll sum these values.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate Final Figures\n- Gross Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost\n- Total Expenses = Sum of all expense categories\n- Profit Before Tax = Gross Profit + Interest Income - Total Expenses\n- Net Profit = Profit Before Tax - Tax Expense\n\nNow, let me perform these calculations:\n\n1. Main Business Revenue: Sum of all \"Sale\" transaction amounts = $2,845,975.11\n2. Total Revenue: $2,845,975.11\n3. Cost of Goods Sold: Sum of all cost_amount values from sales = $1,255,000.00\n4. Total Cost: $1,255,000.00\n5. Gross Profit: $2,845,975.11 - $1,255,000.00 = $1,590,975.11\n6. Administrative Expenses: Sum of \"Administrative Expenses\" transactions = $122,675.62\n7. Selling Expenses: Sum of \"Sales Expenses\" transactions = $257,440.34\n8. Depreciation: Sum of \"Depreciation\" transactions = $91,509.25\n9. Financial Expenses: Sum of \"Financial Expenses\" transactions = $50,283.07\n10. Total Expenses: $122,675.62 + $257,440.34 + $91,509.25 + $50,283.07 = $521,908.28\n11. Interest Income: Sum of \"Interest Receivables\" transactions = $11,640.96\n12. Profit Before Tax: $1,590,975.11 + $11,640.96 - $521,908.28 = $1,080,707.79\n13. Tax Expense: Sum of tax_amount values = $142,298.76\n14. Net Profit: $1,080,707.79 - $142,298.76 = $938,409.03\n\n{\"solution\": {'Main Business Revenue': '2845975.11', 'Total Revenue': '2845975.11', 'Cost of Goods Sold': '1255000.00', 'Total Cost': '1255000.00', 'Gross Profit': '1590975.11', 'Administrative Expenses': '122675.62', 'Selling Expenses': '257440.34', 'Depreciation': '91509.25', 'Financial Expenses': '50283.07', 'Total Expenses': '521908.28', 'Interest Income': '11640.96', 'Profit Before Tax': '1080707.79', 'Tax Expense': '142298.76', 'Net Profit': '938409.03'} }",
