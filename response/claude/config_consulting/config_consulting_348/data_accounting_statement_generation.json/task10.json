                        "content": "I'll solve this problem step-by-step to determine the property, plant, and non-current assets values at both the initial and final points.\n\n## Step 1: Identify initial non-current assets\nFrom the data, I can see an initial fixed assets entry:\n```\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0 |\n```\nThis shows that the company had fixed assets of 5,000,000 at the beginning (2023-12-31).\n\n## Step 2: Identify any depreciation entries\nDepreciation reduces the value of non-current assets. There are two depreciation entries:\n```\n| Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45756.35 | 45756.35 |\n| Depreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | 2024-02-01 | 2024-02-01 | 45752.899999999994 | 45752.899999999994 |\n```\nTotal depreciation = 45,756.35 + 45,752.90 = 91,509.25\n\n## Step 3: Identify any additions to non-current assets\nLooking through the data, I don't see any specific fixed asset purchase transactions or other additions to non-current assets after the initial value. Unlike the example problem which had a \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" entry, this problem doesn't show any such entries.\n\nThe most likely scenario is that all non-current assets were included in the initial 5,000,000 value, and there were no additional purchases of fixed assets during the period.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the ending value of non-current assets\nStarting value: 5,000,000.00\nLess: Total depreciation: 91,509.25\nEquals: Ending value: 4,908,490.75\n\n## Step 5: Format the answer\nThe initial non-current assets value was 5,000,000.00\nThe ending non-current assets value is 4,908,490.75\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '4908490.75'} }\n```",
