Let me analyze the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all transactions that are categorized as \"Financial Expenses\" in the data.\n\nLooking through the transaction data, I'll find all rows where the \"type\" column shows \"Financial Expenses\" and sum up their amounts.\n\nFinancial Expenses transactions:\n1. Expense20240105001: Financial Expenses - 10,108.46\n2. Expense20240114001: Financial Expenses - 5,969.48\n3. Expense20240131001: Financial Expenses - 9,242.60\n4. Expense20240203001: Financial Expenses - 12,974.91\n5. Expense20240204001: Financial Expenses - 11,987.62\n\nLet me calculate the total financial expenses by adding these amounts:\n10,108.46 + 5,969.48 + 9,242.60 + 12,974.91 + 11,987.62 = 50,283.07\n\nTherefore, the final financial expenses item in the income statement is 50,283.07.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Financial Expenses': '50283.07'} }\n```",
