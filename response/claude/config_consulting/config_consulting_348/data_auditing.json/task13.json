Additionally, the tax amount is inconsistent.\n\n   From the invoice: \"On February 02, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $13709.42, totaling $13709.42. The cost amount for this transaction was $5000.00, with a tax amount of $685.47, leading to a total amount due of $13023.95.\"\n\n   But the recorded tax amount is $10821.43, which is much higher than the $685.47 mentioned in the invoice.\n\nI don't see other clear inconsistencies in the data. The correct solution would be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Purchase\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": \"685.47\", \"Recorded tax\": \"10821.43\", \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240202064\"}}\n```",
