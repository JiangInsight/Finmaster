Since invoices are considered more reliable, I'll use those values as the correct ones.\n\nHere's my solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Purchase\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"5000.0\", \"Recorded price\": \"4743.55\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"5000.0\", \"Recorded amount\": \"6049.64\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Purchase20231231004\"}}\n```",
