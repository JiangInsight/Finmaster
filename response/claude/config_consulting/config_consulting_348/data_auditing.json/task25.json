The recorded category is \"Depreciation\" but the invoice clearly states it is a \"Sale\"\n2. The recorded date is \"2024-03-02\" but the invoice indicates \"February 04, 2024\"\n3. The recorded unit price is \"2485.12\" but the invoice states the unit price is \"$2757.29\"\n\nThe invoice mentions:\n\"On February 04, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $2757.29, totaling $2757.29.\"\n\nThis conflicts with the recorded information, and since invoices are considered more reliable due to their standardized nature, these are clear inconsistencies.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Depreciation\", \"Original date\": \"2024-02-04\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-03-02\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"2757.29\", \"Recorded price\": \"2485.12\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240204070\"}}\n```",
