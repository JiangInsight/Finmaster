Date Discrepancy:\n   - Recorded date: 2024-02-02\n   - Invoice text states: \"On January 05, 2024...\"\n   \n2. Amount Discrepancy:\n   - Recorded amount: $2,295.56\n   - Invoice indicates: $2,074.66 (total amount mentioned in text)\n   \n3. Unit Price Discrepancy:\n   - Recorded unit price: $1,934.00\n   - Invoice states: $2,074.66\n   \n4. Tax Amount Discrepancy:\n   - Recorded tax amount: $1,779.03\n   - Invoice states: $103.73\n\nAll these inconsistencies can be verified by comparing the table data with the invoice description. The invoice description is generally more reliable as it represents the official documentation of the transaction.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-05', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-02', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '2074.66', 'Recorded price': '1934.00', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '2074.66', 'Recorded amount': '2295.56', 'Original tax': '103.73', 'Recorded tax': '1779.03', 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240105009'} }\n```",
