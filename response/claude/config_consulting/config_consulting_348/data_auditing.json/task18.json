Looking at entry \"Sale20240103003\":\n   - Recorded amount is 0.0, but invoice says 210203.88\n   - Recorded quantity is 0.0, but invoice says 1.0 unit\n   - Recorded payment/receipt_status is \"Paid\", but invoice says \"unpaid\"\n   - Profit seems incorrect: if cost is 100000.0 and selling price is 210203.88, profit should be 110203.88, not 135051.11\n\nThis entry has multiple inconsistencies between the recorded fields and what the invoice states.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"0.0\", \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"210203.88\", \"Recorded amount\": \"0.0\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": \"110203.88\", \"Recorded profit\": \"135051.11\", \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240103003\"}}\n```",
