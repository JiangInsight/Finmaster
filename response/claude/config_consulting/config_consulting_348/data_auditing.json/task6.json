Let me check:\n- The invoice states \"a unit price of $24990.50\" \n- But the recorded_unit_price is 24944.50\n- The total matches 5 units at the recorded price, so this is indeed an inconsistency\n\nI don't see any other clear inconsistencies in the data where the values recorded contradict the invoice information.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"10969.01\", \"Recorded price\": \"11452.46\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240202065\"}}\n```",
