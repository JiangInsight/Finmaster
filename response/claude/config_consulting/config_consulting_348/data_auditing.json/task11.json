According to the invoice text, this transaction was prepared by \"Supervisor,\" but in the recorded_preparer field, there is no value (it's empty).\n\nThe invoice text states:\n\"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Purchase, consisting of 3.0 units at a unit price of $20000.00, totaling $60000.00. The payment_method of this transaction was bank transfer, and this transaction was paid. This transaction was prepared by Supervisor, and the approver is Director. The supplier ID is S003, and the supplier name is Supplier 3.\"\n\nThis clearly indicates that the preparer should be recorded as \"Supervisor,\" but the recorded_preparer field is empty.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the transaction with ID \"Expense20240125001\", there's also a mismatch. The invoice text states that the transaction was prepared by \"Staff,\" but the recorded_preparer field is empty.\n\nLet me provide the solution for Purchase20231231023:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': 'Supervisor', 'Recorded Preparer': 'None', 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Purchase20231231023'} }\n```",
