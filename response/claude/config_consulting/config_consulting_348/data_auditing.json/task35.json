The ID starts with \"Purchase\" but the recorded_type is \"Sales Expenses\" - this is inconsistent\n2. The recorded_date (2024-01-20) doesn't match what would be expected from the ID (2023-12-31)\n3. The recorded_quantity is 0, which doesn't align with the invoice description mentioning \"1.0 units\"\n4. The recorded_unit_price (4228.45) doesn't match the invoice description stating \"unit price of $5000.00\"\n5. The recorded_amount (5265.11) doesn't match what would be expected from the quantity and price in the invoice\n\nThe invoice text states: \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Purchase, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $5000.00, totaling $5000.00...\"\n\nThis is a clear case where the more reliable invoice information contradicts multiple recorded fields.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Purchase', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original date': '2023-12-31', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-20', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Original payment_method': 'Cash', 'Recorded payment_method': 'Cash', 'Original quantity': '1.0', 'Recorded quantity': '0.0', 'Original price': '5000.0', 'Recorded price': '4228.45', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '5000.0', 'Recorded amount': '5265.11', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': 'Staff', 'Recorded Preparer': 'Staff', 'Original Approver': 'Director', 'Recorded Approver': 'Director', 'id': 'Purchase20231231010'} }\n```",
