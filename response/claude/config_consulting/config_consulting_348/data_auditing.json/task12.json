In transaction \"Expense20240115001\" (Administrative Expenses), the recorded_approver field is missing, but the invoice mentions \"This transaction was prepared by Senior Staff, and the approver is Director.\" This indicates an inconsistency.\n\n2. Similarly, in transaction \"Expense20240127001\" (Sales Expenses), the recorded_approver field is missing, but the invoice mentions \"This transaction was prepared by Supervisor, and the approver is Director.\"\n\nLet me examine these issues more closely:\n\nFor Expense20240115001:\n- The recorded_approver field is empty (NULL)\n- The invoice text states: \"This transaction was prepared by Senior Staff, and the approver is Director.\"\n- The correct value should be \"Director\" based on the invoice description.\n\nFor Expense20240127001:\n- The recorded_approver field is empty (NULL)\n- The invoice text states: \"This transaction was prepared by Supervisor, and the approver is Director.\"\n- The correct value should be \"Director\" based on the invoice description.\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll provide my solution focusing on the transaction with the missing approver:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': 'Director', 'Recorded Approver': 'None', 'id': 'Expense20240127001'} }\n```",
