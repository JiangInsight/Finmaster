Since invoices are generally considered more reliable sources, the correct payment status should be \"Unpaid\" rather than \"Paid\".\n\nSimilarly, for transaction ID: `Interest20240121021`, I notice:\n- The `recorded_payment/receipt_status` is marked as \"Paid\"\n- But the invoice description states: \"The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable, and this transaction was **unpaid**.\"\n\nAgain, this is an inconsistency between the recorded status and the invoice description.\n\nAfter reviewing all other transactions, these are the only two clear inconsistencies I've identified where the recorded fields contradict what's stated in the more reliable invoice descriptions.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240107014'} }\n```",
