I notice a category inconsistency - the ID starts with \"Interest\" but the recorded_type is \"Administrative Expenses\"\n2. The invoice description states it's for \"Interest Receivables\" with an amount of $435.39\n3. However, the recorded_amount is $501.19\n4. The receive_method is correctly stated as \"Interest receviable\" in both places\n\nLet me verify this against the invoice description:\n\"On January 04, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Interest Receivables, totaling $435.39. The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nThis confirms two inconsistencies:\n1. The transaction type should be \"Interest Receivables\" (as shown in the invoice) instead of \"Administrative Expenses\"\n2. The amount should be $435.39 (as shown in the invoice) instead of $501.19\n\nTherefore, my solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Interest Receivables\", \"Recorded category\": \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"435.39\", \"Recorded amount\": \"501.19\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Interest20240104004\"}}\n```",
