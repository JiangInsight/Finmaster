The recorded date is `2024-01-19` but the invoice clearly states `December 31, 2023`\n2. The recorded amount is `11360.98` but the invoice states `totaling $10000.00`\n3. The recorded unit price is `4068.11` but the invoice states `unit price of $5000.00`\n\nThis transaction has multiple fields that don't match the invoice description, which is considered the more reliable source of information.\n\nLooking at other transactions, I also noticed inconsistencies in transaction `Sale20240130057`, where:\n- The invoice date is January 30, 2024, but the recorded date is February 1, 2024\n- The recorded amount ($90992.35) doesn't match what would be calculated from the recorded unit price Ã— quantity\n- The recorded unit price (21750.10) doesn't match what's in the invoice description (24766.75)\n\nBased on my analysis, the clearest inconsistency with multiple errors is in Purchase20231231022.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2023-12-31', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-19', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '5000.0', 'Recorded price': '4068.11', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '10000.0', 'Recorded amount': '11360.98', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Purchase20231231022'} }\n```",
