First, let's check the Purchase20231231023 record:\n   - The ID indicates this should be a \"Purchase\" transaction\n   - However, it's recorded as \"Financial Expenses\" in the recorded_type field\n   - The invoice states \"consisting of 3.0 units\" but the recorded_quantity field shows \"2.0\"\n   - The invoice total of $60,000 also doesn't match the recorded amount of $40,000 (which would be correct for 2 units at $20,000 each)\n   \nThis is a clear inconsistency where both the transaction type and quantity (and consequently the amount) are incorrect.\n\nNow I'll check for other potential inconsistencies in the remaining records...\n\nAfter examining all records, I found one significant inconsistency in Purchase20231231023, where both the transaction type and quantity were incorrectly recorded, affecting the total amount as well.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Purchase\", \"Recorded category\": \"Financial Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"3.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"2.0\", \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"60000.0\", \"Recorded amount\": \"40000.0\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Purchase20231231023\"}}\n```",
