The recorded_type is \"Depreciation\" but the invoice description starts with \"On January 17, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale...\"\n2. The recorded_date is \"2024-02-13\" but the invoice mentions \"January 17, 2024\"\n\nSo this transaction has both a category/type error and a date error. The category should be \"Sale\" not \"Depreciation\", and the date should be \"2024-01-17\" not \"2024-02-13\".\n\nFor other potential inconsistencies, I should verify the transaction ID \"Expense20240122001\". In this case, there's an inconsistency where the recorded_type is \"Financial Expenses\" but the invoice description states \"Administrative Expenses\". Also, the recorded_date is \"2024-01-31\" but the invoice mentions \"January 22, 2024\".\n\nSince the invoice is considered more reliable, these are clear inconsistencies. The original category should be \"Administrative Expenses\" and the original date should be \"2024-01-22\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Depreciation', 'Original date': '2024-01-17', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-13', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240117025'} }\n```",
