The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $2828.89, leading to a total amount due of $53748.86.\"\n\nThis shows that the tax amount should be $2828.89, not $46678.25 as recorded. This is a substantial difference that affects the after-tax calculation as well.\n\nThe math confirms this is an error:\n- Tax on $56577.75 at about 5% would be around $2828.89\n- $56577.75 minus $2828.89 equals $53748.86, which matches the after-tax amount stated\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': '2828.89', 'Recorded tax': '46678.25', 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240131057'} }\n```",
