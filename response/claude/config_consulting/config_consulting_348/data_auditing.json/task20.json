Incorrect transaction type (recorded as Administrative Expenses instead of Sale)\n2. Incorrect unit price (recorded as $2294.12 instead of $2757.29)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Administrative Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '2757.29', 'Recorded price': '2294.12', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240204070'} }\n```",
