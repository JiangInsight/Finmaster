Since invoices are generally more reliable, I'll use them as a reference point when identifying inconsistencies.\n\nLooking at all transactions, I need to find where the recorded values don't match what we would expect based on the invoice description or other fields.\n\nIn the transaction with ID `Sale20240201061`, I notice a few inconsistencies:\n\n1. The invoice states: \"consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $2061.60, totaling $2061.60\"\n2. However, the `recorded_unit_price` is $2317.93 (not $2061.60)\n3. The `recorded_amount` is $2560.77 (not $2061.60)\n\nThis suggests there's a mismatch between what the invoice states and what was recorded in the transaction fields.\n\nThe invoice is likely correct since it's considered more reliable, so the unit price should be $2061.60 and the total amount should also be $2061.60.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '2061.60', 'Recorded price': '2317.93', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '2061.60', 'Recorded amount': '2560.77', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240201061'} }\n```",
