This represents the net change in inventory during the period.\n\nFirst, let me understand how to approach this calculation:\n- If inventory increases during the period, this is a use of cash (negative in cash flow)\n- If inventory decreases during the period, this is a source of cash (positive in cash flow)\n\nI'll need to identify all purchase and sale transactions that affect inventory.\n\n## Step 1: Identify all inventory purchases\nLooking at the \"Purchase\" type transactions:\n\n| Transaction ID | Amount | Product |\n|----------------|--------|---------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | 300,000.00 | Enterprise Solution |\n| Purchase20231231002 | 2,000.00 | Basic Consulting |\n| Purchase20231231003 | 300,000.00 | Enterprise Solution |\n| Purchase20231231004 | 1,000.00 | Basic Consulting |\n| Purchase20231231005 | 200,000.00 | Enterprise Solution |\n| Purchase20231231006 | 5,000.00 | Standard Consulting |\n| Purchase20231231007 | 3,000.00 | Basic Consulting |\n| Purchase20231231008 | 2,000.00 | Basic Consulting |\n| Purchase20231231009 | 200,000.00 | Enterprise Solution |\n| Purchase20231231010 | 200,000.00 | Enterprise Solution |\n| Purchase20231231011 | 200,000.00 | Enterprise Solution |\n| Purchase20231231012 | 200,000.00 | Enterprise Solution |\n| Purchase20231231013 | 5,000.00 | Standard Consulting |\n| Purchase20231231014 | 10,000.00 | Standard Consulting |\n| Purchase20231231015 | 2,000.00 | Basic Consulting |\n| Purchase20231231016 | 40,000.00 | Premium Consulting |\n| Purchase20231231017 | 10,000.00 | Standard Consulting |\n\nTotal purchases: 1,680,000.00\n\n## Step 2: Identify all inventory sales (at cost)\nFor each sale, I need to identify the cost of goods sold (cost_amount):\n\n| Transaction ID | Cost Amount | Product |\n|----------------|-------------|---------|\n| Sale20240102001 | 100,000.00 | Enterprise Solution |\n| Sale20240102002 | 100,000.00 | Enterprise Solution |\n| Sale20240103004 | 100,000.00 | Enterprise Solution |\n| Sale20240106006 | 100,000.00 | Enterprise Solution |\n| Sale20240107008 | 1,000.00 | Basic Consulting |\n| Sale20240108010 | 100,000.00 | Enterprise Solution |\n| Sale20240110012 | 1,000.00 | Basic Consulting |\n| Sale20240110013 | 100,000.00 | Enterprise Solution |\n| Sale20240111015 | 1,000.00 | Basic Consulting |\n| Sale20240111016 | 100,000.00 | Enterprise Solution |\n| Sale20240111017 | 100,000.00 | Enterprise Solution |\n| Sale20240112018 | 5,000.00 | Standard Consulting |\n| Sale20240123031 | 1,000.00 | Basic Consulting |\n| Sale20240127036 | 1,000.00 | Basic Consulting |\n| Sale20240128037 | 100,000.00 | Enterprise Solution |\n| Sale20240128038 | 100,000.00 | Enterprise Solution |\n| Sale20240130040 | 100,000.00 | Enterprise Solution |\n| Sale20240130041 | 100,000.00 | Enterprise Solution |\n| Sale20240130042 | 1,000.00 | Basic Consulting |\n| Sale20240131044 | 100,000.00 | Enterprise Solution |\n| Sale20240131045 | 1,000.00 | Basic Consulting |\n| Sale20240204049 | 5,000.00 | Standard Consulting |\n| Sale20240205052 | 20,000.00 | Premium Consulting |\n\nTotal sales (at cost): 1,437,000.00\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the change in inventory\nChange in Inventory = Total Purchases - Total Sales (at cost)\nChange in Inventory = 1,680,000.00 - 1,437,000.00 = 243,000.00\n\nSince this is an increase in inventory (positive value), it represents a use of cash in the cash flow statement. In the cash flow statement format, this would be shown as a negative value (cash outflow).\n\nTherefore, the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" would be: -243,000.00\n\nHowever, I should double-check my work. Looking at the problem description more carefully, I notice this is a consulting business selling services, not physical products. The inventory item here may represent service products that the company has purchased and will sell to customers.\n\nLet me confirm the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-243000.00'}}\n```",
