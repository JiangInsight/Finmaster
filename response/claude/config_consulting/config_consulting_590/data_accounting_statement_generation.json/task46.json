Initial cash deposit on 2023-12-31: 3,000,000.00\n2. Initial bank deposit on 2023-12-31: 5,000,000.00\n\nThe beginning cash and cash equivalents balance is the sum of these initial balances, which represents the cash position at the start of the reporting period.\n\nLooking at the transactions table, I can see that on 2023-12-31, there were two relevant entries:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n\nThe sum of these two amounts is 8,000,000.00, which represents the total cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.\n\nTherefore, the beginning cash and cash equivalents balance in the cash flow statement is 8,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
