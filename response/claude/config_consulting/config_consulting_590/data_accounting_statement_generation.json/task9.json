The initial fixed assets amount is 5,000,000.00 and the only reductions appear to be from depreciation.\n\nTherefore, the final fixed assets net value is:\nInitial: 5,000,000.00\nFinal: 5,000,000.00 - 91,492.31 = 4,908,507.69\n\nLet me format this as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'fixed assets net Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'fixed assets net End Value': '4908507.69'} }\n```",
