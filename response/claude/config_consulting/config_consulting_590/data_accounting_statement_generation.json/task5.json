The interest receivable represents the accumulated interest that has been earned but not yet received. In the data, I need to identify transactions related to interest receivables.\n\nStep 2: Looking at the data, I can see several transactions with the type \"Interest Receivables\". These are the entries I need to analyze.\n\nStep 3: I need to determine the initial value and the final value of interest receivables.\n- The initial value would be the value at the beginning of the period (2023-12-31)\n- The final value would be the accumulated balance at the end of the period (2024-02-05)\n\nStep 4: I'll track all interest receivable transactions in chronological order:\n\n2024-01-01: 418.30\n2024-01-02: 418.30\n2024-01-03: 418.30\n2024-01-04: 418.12\n2024-01-05: 418.12\n2024-01-06: 418.03\n2024-01-07: 418.03\n2024-01-08: 418.03\n2024-01-09: 418.03\n2024-01-10: 418.03\n2024-01-11: 418.03\n2024-01-12: 418.03\n2024-01-13: 418.03\n2024-01-14: 418.03\n2024-01-15: 418.03\n2024-01-16: 418.03\n2024-01-17: 418.03\n2024-01-18: 418.03\n2024-01-19: 418.03\n2024-01-20: 418.03\n2024-01-21: 418.03\n2024-01-22: 417.77\n2024-01-23: 417.77\n2024-01-24: 417.77\n2024-01-25: 417.77\n2024-01-26: 417.77\n2024-01-27: 417.77\n2024-01-28: 417.77\n2024-01-29: 399.97\n2024-01-30: 399.97\n2024-01-31: 382.17\n2024-02-01: 382.17\n2024-02-02: 382.17\n2024-02-03: 381.99\n2024-02-04: 381.99\n2024-02-05: 381.99\n\nStep 5: The initial value is 0.00 since there are no interest receivable transactions on or before 2023-12-31.\n\nStep 6: The final value is the sum of all the interest receivable transactions:\n418.30 + 418.30 + 418.30 + 418.12 + 418.12 + 418.03 + 418.03 + 418.03 + 418.03 + 418.03 + 418.03 + 418.03 + 418.03 + 418.03 + 418.03 + 418.03 + 418.03 + 418.03 + 418.03 + 418.03 + 418.03 + 417.77 + 417.77 + 417.77 + 417.77 + 417.77 + 417.77 + 417.77 + 399.97 + 399.97 + 382.17 + 382.17 + 382.17 + 381.99 + 381.99 + 381.99 = 14,763.23\n\nTherefore, the interest receivable balance at the end of the period is 14,763.23.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Interest Receivable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Interest Receivable End Value': '14763.23'} }\n```",
