                        "content": "I need to calculate the final net cash flow from operating activities for the cash flow statement. Let me analyze the transactions systematically.\n\nIn the cash flow statement, operating activities include:\n- Cash receipts from sales of goods/services\n- Cash payments to suppliers for goods/services\n- Cash payments to employees\n- Cash receipts and payments for other operating activities\n\nLet me separate operating cash flows from other activities:\n\n1. First, I'll identify all cash inflows from operating activities:\n   - Cash sales (receive_method = \"Cash\")\n   - Interest received (if cash received)\n\n2. Then I'll identify all cash outflows from operating activities:\n   - Cash payments for purchases (if paid via Cash/Bank Transfer)\n   - Payments for expenses (Administrative, Sales, Financial expenses)\n   - Interest paid (if applicable)\n\n3. I'll exclude non-operating and non-cash activities:\n   - Initial deposits\n   - Fixed asset purchases\n   - Depreciation (non-cash)\n   - Transfers between accounts (not affecting total cash)\n   - Unpaid receivables/payables\n\nLet me go through the data:\n\n**Cash Inflows from Operations:**\n- Sale20240108010: 285,922.71 (Cash sale)\n- Sale20240111017: 193,204.06 (Cash sale)\n- Sale20240127036: 2,203.63 (Cash sale)\n- Sale20240131045: 2,255.80 (Cash sale)\n- Sale20240204049: 11,896.81 (Cash sale)\nTotal Cash Inflows: 495,483.01\n\n**Cash Outflows from Operations:**\n- Purchase transactions (paid): 300,000 + 2,000 + 300,000 + 1,000 + 200,000 + 3,000 + 200,000 + 200,000 + 2,000 + 10,000 = 1,218,000\n- Administrative Expenses: 7,069.68 + 13,381.35 + 18,522.55 + 7,550.68 + 17,921.98 + 16,893.65 + 9,840.4 + 16,654.12 + 4,461.27 + 12,390.55 + 17,013.85 + 18,333 + 17,959.24 + 2,784.18 + 13,728.52 + 19,421.61 + 3,082.57 + 3,882.45 + 6,121.99 + 15,370.59 + 13,782.27 + 15,719.57 = 271,886.12\n- Sales Expenses: 13,305.95 + 11,861.78 + 13,930.48 + 12,925.57 + 8,666.24 + 14,246.91 + 16,705.92 + 19,270.58 + 3,803.96 + 19,701.69 + 13,134.95 + 13,669.93 + 10,766.33 + 5,600.05 + 8,771.29 + 10,538.58 + 17,948.72 + 11,989.77 + 5,737.39 + 14,261.76 + 5,081 + 3,342.58 + 6,484.02 + 16,033.09 + 13,137.94 + 8,191.03 + 3,938.06 + 8,383.91 = 311,429.48\n- Financial Expenses: 7,928.54 + 9,001.74 + 7,754.91 + 3,133.97 + 4,579.76 + 15,308.56 + 6,837.24 = 54,544.72\nTotal Cash Outflows: 1,855,860.32\n\n**Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:**\n= Total Cash Inflows - Total Cash Outflows\n= 495,483.01 - 1,855,860.32\n= -1,360,377.31\n\nHowever, I need to verify whether I've included all relevant transactions.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet impact:\n- Initial cash/bank deposits are not operating activities (funding)\n- Fixed asset purchases are investing activities\n- Depreciation is a non-cash expense\n- Interest receivables are accrued but not cash received\n- Transfer between cash and bank accounts is not an operating cash flow (just moving money)\n\nI notice there may be some purchases and expenses I need to verify are truly operating activities. Let me review all cash transactions again...\n\nAfter careful analysis of the provided transactions, I can see that all the relevant operating cash flows have been identified. The negative cash flow indicates that more cash was spent on operating activities than was generated during this period.\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities': '-1360377.31'} }\n```",
