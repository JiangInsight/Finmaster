Let me work through this step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Calculate Net Profit\nFirst, I need to identify all revenue and expense transactions to calculate net profit.\n\n### Revenues:\n- Sales transactions (identified by \"Sale\" type)\n- Interest receivables (identified by \"Interest Receivables\" type)\n\n### Expenses:\n- Administrative expenses\n- Sales expenses\n- Financial expenses\n- Depreciation\n- Cost of goods sold (from sales transactions)\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n- Net profit (calculated in step 1)\n- Adjustments for non-cash items (depreciation)\n- Changes in working capital (accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, interest receivable, tax payable)\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n- Purchase of fixed assets\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Cash Changes\n- Beginning balance (from initial deposits)\n- Ending balance (calculated from transactions)\n- Net increase/decrease in cash\n\nLet me perform these calculations:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Net Profit\": \"-198635.70\", \"Depreciation\": \"91492.31\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-2153094.51\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-12335.40\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-1206000.00\", \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"257000.00\", \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"120849.79\", \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-3100723.51\", \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"0.00\", \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": \"0.00\", \"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\", \"Ending Balance\": \"4899276.49\", \"Net Increase\": \"-3100723.51\"}}\n```",
