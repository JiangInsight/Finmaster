First, let's find the initial value of Fixed Assets:\n   - There's an entry on 2023-12-31 with type \"Fixed Assets\" and amount 5000000.0\n   \n2. Next, I need to look for any other transactions that affect fixed assets:\n   - Looking through the data, I don't see any specific \"Fixed Asset Purchase\" type transactions like in the example\n   - I also don't see an \"asset_name\" or \"asset_type\" column in this problem data\n   - The depreciation transactions would reduce the fixed assets value\n   \n3. For depreciation:\n   - There are two depreciation entries:\n     - On 2024-01-01: 45747.38\n     - On 2024-02-01: 45744.93\n   - Total depreciation: 91492.31\n\n4. After careful examination, I don't see any other transactions that clearly add to fixed assets. In the task example, there was a \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" transaction type that added to fixed assets, but I don't see such a transaction type in this problem.\n\n5. Since there are no additions to fixed assets, the final value would be:\n   Initial Value - Total Depreciation = 5000000.00 - 91492.31 = 4908507.69\n\nHowever, this calculation seems potentially incomplete. Let me double-check the data again...\n\nUpon further inspection, I still don't see any explicit fixed asset purchases or disposals in this dataset. The only transactions affecting fixed assets are the initial amount and the depreciation entries.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Fixed Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Fixed Assets End Value': '4908507.69'}}\n```",
