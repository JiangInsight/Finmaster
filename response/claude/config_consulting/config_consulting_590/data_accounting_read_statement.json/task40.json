When this number is positive, it indicates that the company's accounts payable increased during the period, meaning they added to what they owe for goods and services purchased on credit.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement provided:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable | 462000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThis line item shows a positive amount of 462000.00, which indicates an increase in accounts payable during the period. This is exactly what the task is asking for - the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit.\n\nTherefore, the value is 462000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '462000.00'}}\n```",
