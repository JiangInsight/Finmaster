Accounts receivable represents money owed to the company by its customers for products or services delivered on credit.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement provided:\n- I can see \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with a value of -2902136.39\n\nThe negative value indicates an increase in accounts receivable (more money owed to the company). In cash flow terminology, an increase in accounts receivable is shown as a negative number because it represents cash that the company has earned but not yet received, thus reducing cash flow.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and value representing the change in amounts owed to the entity is \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with a value of -2902136.39.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2902136.39'}}\n```",
