Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- \"Paid-in Capital\" represents capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares: 13000000.00\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- \"Profit Before Tax\" represents profit or loss before deducting tax expense: 1337664.61\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" represents the addition in amount owed for goods/services on credit: 462000.00\n\nTherefore, the three values I need to extract are:\n- value1: 13000000.00 (Paid-in Capital)\n- value2: 1337664.61 (Profit Before Tax)\n- value3: 462000.00 (Increase in Accounts Payable)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1337664.61', 'value3': '462000.00'}}\n```",
