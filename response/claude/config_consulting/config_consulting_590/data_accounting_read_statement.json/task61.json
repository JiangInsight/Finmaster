Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\nFirst, for costs to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services, this would typically appear in the Income Statement as \"Selling Expenses\". Looking at the Income Statement, I can see:\n- Selling Expenses: 319828.12\n\nSecond, for cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment, this would typically appear in the Cash Flow Statement under investing activities. Looking at the Cash Flow Statement, I can see:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 0.00\n\nThe first value is 319828.12 (Selling Expenses from the Income Statement).\nThe second value is 0.00 (Purchase of Fixed Assets from the Cash Flow Statement).\n\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '319828.12', 'value2': '0.00'}}",
