This is exactly what I'm looking for.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n```\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\n\nThe beginning balance of cash and cash equivalents is clearly stated as 8000000.00.\n\nI can also verify this by looking at the balance sheet, where the Initial_amount for \"Cash on Hand\" (3000000.00) and \"Bank Deposits\" (5000000.00) as of 2023-12-31 sum to 8000000.00, which matches the beginning balance in the cash flow statement.\n\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8000000.00'}}",
