This is the category that typically includes buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, etc.\n\nFrom the data provided, I can see:\n- Fixed Assets initial amount: 5000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- Fixed Assets end amount: 5000000.00 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\nNote that there is also an \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line that shows depreciation on the fixed assets. This is a contra-asset account that reduces the value of fixed assets, but the task is asking for the specific line items that represent the tangible assets themselves.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5000000.00'}}\n```",
