In accounting, these are typically considered cash equivalents.\n\nFor this task, I should include the sum of both line items:\n- Initial value: 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 8,000,000.00\n- End value: 2,339,224.10 + 4,292,000.00 = 6,631,224.10\n\nHowever, based on the example provided, it appears that only \"Cash on Hand\" is considered the specific line item for cash available for day-to-day operations, not including bank deposits.\n\nFollowing the example's approach:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '3000000.00', 'end value': '2339224.10'}}\n```",
