Finally, the cash flow statement confirms this amount with \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" of 169,880.98.\n\nSince the task is to identify the total amount of tax an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period, the tax expense from the income statement represents this value.\n\nBased on the financial statement, the specific line item is \"Tax Expense\" with a value of 169,880.98.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"169880.98\"}}\n```",
