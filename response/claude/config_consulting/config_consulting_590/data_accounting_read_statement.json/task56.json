In the balance sheet, I can see the \"Accumulated Depreciation\" account with an end amount of 91,492.31.\n\n2. In the cash flow statement, there's a line item \"Depreciation\" with an amount of 91,492.31.\n\n3. In the income statement, there's a line item \"Depreciation\" with an amount of 91,492.31.\n\nThe depreciation is consistently shown as 91,492.31 across all statements where it appears. This represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of the company's assets over their useful lives during this reporting period.\n\nTherefore, the value I need to extract is 91,492.31.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91492.31'} }\n```",
