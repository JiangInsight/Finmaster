First, I'll check the balance sheet for interest-related line items:\n   - There's a line \"Interest Receivable\" which represents interest that has been earned but not yet received\n   - Initial amount: 0.00 on 2023-12-31\n   - End amount: 14796.43 on 2024-02-05\n\n2. To confirm this is the correct value, I'll look at the income statement:\n   - There's a line \"Interest Income\" with a value of 14796.43\n   - This matches the Interest Receivable on the balance sheet\n\n3. I'll also check the cash flow statement:\n   - There's an adjustment for \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" of -14796.43\n   - The negative value indicates an increase in Interest Receivable, which confirms our finding\n\nThis confirms that \"Interest Receivable\" is the line item that represents interest accrued but not yet received, with an initial value of 0.00 and an end value of 14796.43.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '14796.43'}}\n```",
