                        "content": "I need to calculate three financial ratios based on the provided financial statements. Let me work through each one step by step.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nThis ratio measures the relationship between operating cash flow and net income.\n\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Net Income\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,368,775.90\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1,167,783.63\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = -1,368,775.90 / 1,167,783.63 = -1.17\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio (also called Turnover Ratio)\n\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company is using its current assets to generate sales.\n\nFormula: Revenue / Average Current Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 3,397,619.40\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Current Assets = 8,000,000.00\n- Ending Current Assets = 9,891,156.92\n- Average Current Assets = (8,000,000.00 + 9,891,156.92) / 2 = 8,945,578.46\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = 3,397,619.40 / 8,945,578.46 = 0.38\n\n### 3. Quick Ratio\n\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n\nFormula: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = 9,891,156.92\n- Inventory = 343,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 631,880.98\n\nQuick Ratio = (9,891,156.92 - 343,000.00) / 631,880.98 = 9,548,156.92 / 631,880.98 = 15.11\n\nNow I'll format these results according to the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-1.17', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.38', 'Quick Ratio': '15.11'} }\n```",
