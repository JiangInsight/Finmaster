                        "content": "I'll calculate the requested financial ratios step by step based on the provided financial statements.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to cover current liabilities with operating cash flows.\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,368,775.90\n- Total Current Liabilities = 631,880.98\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -1,368,775.90 / 631,880.98 = -2.17\n\n## 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay off its debt with its operating cash flow.\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,368,775.90\n- Total Liabilities = 631,880.98\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -1,368,775.90 / 631,880.98 = -2.17\n\n## 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period.\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 1,337,000.00\n- Average Inventory = (0 + 343,000.00) / 2 = 171,500.00\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = 1,337,000.00 / 171,500.00 = 7.80\n\n## 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures a company's financial leverage.\n- Total Liabilities = 631,880.98\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,167,783.63\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = 631,880.98 / 14,167,783.63 = 0.04\n\n## 5. Quick Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n- Quick Assets = Total Current Assets - Inventory = 9,891,156.92 - 343,000.00 = 9,548,156.92\n- Total Current Liabilities = 631,880.98\n- Quick Ratio = 9,548,156.92 / 631,880.98 = 15.11\n\n## 6. Current Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations.\n- Total Current Assets = 9,891,156.92\n- Total Current Liabilities = 631,880.98\n- Current Ratio = 9,891,156.92 / 631,880.98 = 15.65\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-2.17\", \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-2.17\", \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"7.80\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.04\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"15.11\", \"Current Ratio\": \"15.65\"}}\n```",
