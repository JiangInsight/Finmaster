Debt to Asset Ratio\nThe formula is: Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = $631,880.98 (Total Current Liabilities)\n- Total Assets = $14,799,664.61\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $631,880.98 / $14,799,664.61 = 0.0427 ≈ 0.04\n\n## 2. Gross Profit Margin\nThe formula is: (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = $2,060,619.40\n- Total Revenue = $3,397,619.40\n\nGross Profit Margin = ($2,060,619.40 / $3,397,619.40) × 100% = 60.65%\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThe formula is: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement and balance sheet:\n- Operating Cash Flow = -$1,368,775.90 (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities)\n- Current Liabilities = $631,880.98 (Total Current Liabilities)\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$1,368,775.90 / $631,880.98 = -2.17\n\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04', 'Gross Profit Margin': '60.65%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.17'}}",
