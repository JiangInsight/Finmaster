The Debt to Asset Ratio shows what proportion of a company's assets is financed by debt.\n\nThe formula for Debt to Asset Ratio is:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nStep 1: Identify the Total Liabilities from the balance sheet.\n- From the table, I can see the \"Total Current Liabilities\" is $631,880.98\n- There don't appear to be any non-current liabilities listed\n- Therefore, Total Liabilities = $631,880.98\n\nStep 2: Identify the Total Assets from the balance sheet.\n- From the table, I can see \"Total Assets\" is $14,799,664.61\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio.\n- Debt to Asset Ratio = $631,880.98 / $14,799,664.61 = 0.0427\n\nStep 4: Round to 2 decimal places.\n- Debt to Asset Ratio = 0.04\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04'} }\n```",
