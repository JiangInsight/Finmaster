ROE measures how efficiently a company uses its equity to generate profits.\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\nROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the income statement, I can see:\n- Net Profit (Net Income): $1,167,783.63\n\nFrom the balance sheet, I need to calculate the average shareholders' equity:\n- Beginning Total Owner's Equity: $13,000,000.00 (Initial_amount)\n- Ending Total Owner's Equity: $14,167,783.63 (End_amount)\n- Average Shareholders' Equity = ($13,000,000.00 + $14,167,783.63) / 2 = $13,583,891.82\n\nNow I can calculate ROE:\nROE = $1,167,783.63 / $13,583,891.82 = 0.0859696 or approximately 8.60%\n\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '8.60%'}}",
