The `recorded_type` is \"Sales Expenses\" but the invoice description mentions \"Financial Expenses\"\n2. The `recorded_date` is \"2024-01-06\" but the invoice description mentions \"January 05, 2024\"\n3. The `recorded_amount` is $8620.31 but the invoice description mentions $7928.54\n\nSince the invoice text is considered more reliable, I can conclude these are errors in the recorded fields.\n\nHere's my solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Financial Expenses\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-05\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-06\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"7928.54\", \"Recorded amount\": \"8620.31\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Expense20240105001\"}}\n```",
