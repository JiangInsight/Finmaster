I'll pay special attention to the invoice descriptions since they are generally considered more reliable.\n\nFirst, I notice a transaction \"Sale20240128037\" where the recorded_type is \"Administrative Expenses\" but the transaction ID and invoice indicate it's a \"Sale\". Let me analyze this entry in detail:\n\nTransaction ID: Sale20240128037\n- Recorded type: Administrative Expenses (incorrect)\n- Correct type based on ID and invoice: Sale\n- Recorded amount: $293810.05\n- Invoice mentions a sale consisting of 1.0 units at $241259.43, totaling $241259.43\n- Recorded unit price: $266343.26 (inconsistent with invoice)\n\nThis transaction has multiple inconsistencies:\n1. The transaction type is incorrectly recorded as \"Administrative Expenses\" when it should be \"Sale\"\n2. The recorded amount ($293810.05) doesn't match the invoice total ($241259.43)\n3. The recorded unit price ($266343.26) doesn't match the invoice unit price ($241259.43)\n\nTherefore, the inconsistencies in Sale20240128037 are:\n- Original category: Sale (from invoice and ID)\n- Recorded category: Administrative Expenses\n- Original price: $241259.43 (from invoice)\n- Recorded price: $266343.26\n- Original amount: $241259.43 (from invoice)\n- Recorded amount: $293810.05\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Administrative Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '241259.43', 'Recorded price': '266343.26', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '241259.43', 'Recorded amount': '293810.05', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240128037'} }",
