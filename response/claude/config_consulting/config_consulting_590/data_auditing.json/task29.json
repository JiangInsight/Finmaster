Looking at the recorded information:\n   - Recorded date: 2024-01-25\n   - Recorded amount: $312,388.87\n   - Recorded unit price: $298,921.57\n   - Recorded tax amount: $309,818.31\n   - Recorded after tax amount: $271,626.57\n   - Recorded profit: $185,922.71\n\n2. Checking the invoice description:\n   - \"On January 08, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $285,922.71, totaling $285,922.71. The cost amount for this transaction was $100,000.00, with a tax amount of $14,296.14, leading to a total amount due of $271,626.57. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\n3. Analyzing discrepancies:\n   - Date: Invoice says January 08, 2024, but record shows January 25, 2024\n   - Unit price: Invoice says $285,922.71, but record shows $298,921.57\n   - Total amount: Invoice says $285,922.71, but record shows $312,388.87\n   - Tax amount: Invoice says $14,296.14, but record shows $309,818.31\n   - After-tax amount: Both show $271,626.57 (consistent)\n   - Profit: Should be $285,922.71 - $100,000.00 = $185,922.71 (matches recorded profit)\n\n4. Internal consistency check:\n   - The invoice states unit price × quantity ($285,922.71 × 1) = $285,922.71 total amount\n   - The invoice states total amount - tax ($285,922.71 - $14,296.14) = $271,626.57 after-tax amount\n   - The invoice states total amount - cost amount ($285,922.71 - $100,000.00) = $185,922.71 profit\n\nThe invoice appears internally consistent, but the recorded information has several discrepancies. Based on this analysis, I'll prepare the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Original date\": \"2024-01-08\",\n  \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-25\",\n  \"Original price\": \"285922.71\",\n  \"Recorded price\": \"298921.57\",\n  \"Original amount\": \"285922.71\",\n  \"Recorded amount\": \"312388.87\",\n  \"Original tax\": \"14296.14\",\n  \"Recorded tax\": \"309818.31\",\n  \"id\": \"Sale20240108010\"\n}}\n```",
