The category is recorded as \"Administrative Expenses\" but the ID and invoice suggest it should be a \"Sale\"\n2. The date in the record is \"2024-02-18\" but the invoice clearly states \"January 31, 2024\"\n3. The unit price is recorded as $2160.67, but the invoice mentions $2255.80\n\nThe invoice details also confirm this is a sale transaction with:\n- Cost amount: $1000.00\n- Tax amount: $112.79\n- Total due: $2143.01\n- Payment method: cash\n- Status: paid\n\nThis demonstrates a clear mismatch between the recorded information and what's stated in the invoice, which is generally considered more reliable due to its standardized and regulated nature.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-31\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-02-18\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Original price\": \"2255.80\", \"Recorded price\": \"2160.67\", \"Original receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original amount\": \"2255.80\", \"Recorded amount\": \"2255.80\", \"Original tax\": \"112.79\", \"Recorded tax\": \"112.79\", \"Original profit\": \"1255.80\", \"Recorded profit\": \"1255.80\", \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240131045\"}}\n```",
