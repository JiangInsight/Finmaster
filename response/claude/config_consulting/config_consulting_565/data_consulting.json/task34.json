                        "content": "I'll solve this step by step, calculating each financial ratio based on the given statements.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with cash generated from operations.\n- Operating Cash Flow = -1,182,491.05\n- Current Liabilities = 499,821.72\n- Ratio = -1,182,491.05 / 499,821.72 = -2.37\n\n## 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures the company's financial leverage.\n- Total Liabilities = 499,821.72\n- Total Equity = 14,390,936.99\n- Ratio = 499,821.72 / 14,390,936.99 = 0.035\n\n## 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis shows how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n- Revenue = 3,956,433.90\n- Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 14,890,758.71) / 2 = 13,945,379.36\n- Ratio = 3,956,433.90 / 13,945,379.36 = 0.28\n\n## 4. Quick Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n- Quick Assets = Cash + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable\n- Quick Assets = 2,103,508.95 + 4,714,000.00 + 3,149,338.94 + 15,414.09 = 9,982,261.98\n- Current Liabilities = 499,821.72\n- Ratio = 9,982,261.98 / 499,821.72 = 19.97\n\n## 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis is the same as Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -2.37\n\n## 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\nThis measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit it generates with the money shareholders have invested.\n- Net Profit = 1,390,936.99\n- Average Equity = (13,000,000.00 + 14,390,936.99) / 2 = 13,695,468.50\n- ROE = (1,390,936.99 / 13,695,468.50) Ã— 100% = 10.16%\n\n## 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company collects revenue and uses its assets.\n- Revenue = 3,956,433.90\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 3,149,338.94) / 2 = 1,574,669.47\n- Ratio = 3,956,433.90 / 1,574,669.47 = 2.51\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-2.37\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.035\", \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.28\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"19.97\", \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-2.37\", \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"10.16%\", \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.51\"}}\n```",
