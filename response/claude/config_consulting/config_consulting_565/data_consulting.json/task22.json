The formula is:\n\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = $9,982,261.98\n- Inventory = $0.00\n- Current Liabilities = $499,821.72\n\nQuick Ratio = ($9,982,261.98 - $0.00) / $499,821.72\nQuick Ratio = $9,982,261.98 / $499,821.72\nQuick Ratio = 19.97\n\n## Net Profit Margin Calculation\n\nThe Net Profit Margin measures what percentage of revenue is turned into profit. The formula is:\n\nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = $1,390,936.99\n- Total Revenue = $3,956,433.90\n\nNet Profit Margin = ($1,390,936.99 / $3,956,433.90) × 100%\nNet Profit Margin = 0.3516 × 100%\nNet Profit Margin = 35.16%\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '19.97', 'Net Profit Margin': '35.16%'}}\n```",
