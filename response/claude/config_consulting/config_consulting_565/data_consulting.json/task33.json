Since average inventory is 0, this ratio cannot be calculated properly (would result in division by zero). But we can note that with no inventory held, the company likely operates on a just-in-time basis or is service-based.\nWill mark as \"N/A\" for not applicable.\n\n## Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio indicates the proportion of debt a company uses to finance its assets compared to equity.\nFormula: Total Liabilities ÷ Total Owner's Equity\n= 499,821.72 ÷ 14,390,936.99\n= 0.03\n\n## Quick Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory.\nFormula: (Current Assets - Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities\n= (9,982,261.98 - 0) ÷ 499,821.72\n= 9,982,261.98 ÷ 499,821.72\n= 19.97\n\n## Current Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations.\nFormula: Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities\n= 9,982,261.98 ÷ 499,821.72\n= 19.97\n\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.37', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.37', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': 'N/A', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Quick Ratio': '19.97', 'Current Ratio': '19.97'}}",
