                        "content": "I'll calculate the three financial ratios step by step.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\nThis ratio measures how well a company converts its net income to cash flow.\n\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,182,491.05\n- Net Profit = 1,390,936.99\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = -1,182,491.05 / 1,390,936.99 = -0.85\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company is using its current assets to generate revenue.\n\nFormula: Current Assets Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Average Current Assets\n\n- Revenue = 3,956,433.90\n- Initial Current Assets = 8,000,000.00\n- Ending Current Assets = 9,982,261.98\n- Average Current Assets = (8,000,000.00 + 9,982,261.98) / 2 = 8,991,130.99\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = 3,956,433.90 / 8,991,130.99 = 0.44\n\n### 3. Quick Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n\nFormula: Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = 9,982,261.98\n- Inventory = 0.00\n- Current Liabilities = 499,821.72\n\nQuick Ratio = (9,982,261.98 - 0.00) / 499,821.72 = 19.97\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.85', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.44', 'Quick Ratio': '19.97'}}\n```",
