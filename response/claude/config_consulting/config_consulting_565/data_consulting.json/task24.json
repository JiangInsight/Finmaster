Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit\n\nStep 1: Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $499,821.72\n- Total Assets = $14,890,758.71\n- Debt to Asset Ratio = $499,821.72 / $14,890,758.71 = 0.0336 or approximately 0.03\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = ($1,182,491.05) (negative value)\n- Net Profit = $1,390,936.99\n- Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = ($1,182,491.05) / $1,390,936.99 = -0.85 or approximately -0.85\n\nNote: The Operating Cash Flow is negative while Net Income is positive, resulting in a negative ratio. This indicates that while the company is reporting profits, it's not generating positive cash flow from operations.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.85'}}\n```",
