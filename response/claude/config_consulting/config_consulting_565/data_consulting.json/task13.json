                        "content": "I need to calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the Inventory Turnover Ratio is:\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nLooking at the provided statements:\n1. From the income statement: Cost of Goods Sold = $1,684,000.00\n2. From the balance sheet:\n   - Beginning Inventory (2023-12-31) = $0.00\n   - Ending Inventory (2024-02-05) = $0.00\n\nNext, I'll calculate the average inventory:\nAverage Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2\nAverage Inventory = ($0.00 + $0.00) / 2 = $0.00\n\nThe inventory turnover ratio calculation would be:\nInventory Turnover Ratio = $1,684,000.00 / $0.00\n\nHowever, since division by zero is not possible, and both beginning and ending inventory are zero, this indicates that:\n1. The company may be selling services rather than goods\n2. The company may be using a just-in-time inventory system where goods are immediately sold upon receipt\n3. The inventory may be moving so quickly that it doesn't show up in the period-end balance sheets\n\nIn this case, since cost of goods sold exists but inventory is zero, it's not possible to calculate a meaningful inventory turnover ratio in the traditional way.\n\nThe appropriate response is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Turnover Ratio': 'N/A'}}\n```",
