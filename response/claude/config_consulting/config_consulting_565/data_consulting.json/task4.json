This ratio measures a company's financial leverage by comparing total liabilities to total shareholders' equity.\n\nThe formula for Debt to Equity Ratio is:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet as of 2024-02-05:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $499,821.72\n- Total Owner's Equity = $14,390,936.99\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $499,821.72 / $14,390,936.99 = 0.03472\n\nRounded to 2 decimal places: 0.03\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03'}}\n```",
