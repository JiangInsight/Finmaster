                        "content": "I'll calculate the three financial ratios: ROE, Debt to Asset Ratio, and Gross Profit Margin.\n\n## Step 1: Return on Equity (ROE)\nROE measures how efficiently a company uses its equity to generate profits. The formula is:\nROE = Net Profit / Total Owner's Equity\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = $1,390,936.99\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Owner's Equity (end date) = $14,390,936.99\n\nROE = $1,390,936.99 / $14,390,936.99 = 0.0966 = 9.66%\n\n## Step 2: Debt to Asset Ratio\nThis ratio shows what proportion of a company's assets is financed by debt. The formula is:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities (end date) = $499,821.72 (Total Current Liabilities)\n- Total Assets (end date) = $14,890,758.71\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $499,821.72 / $14,890,758.71 = 0.0336 ≈ 0.03\n\n## Step 3: Gross Profit Margin\nThis ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold. The formula is:\nGross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = $2,272,433.90\n- Total Revenue = $3,956,433.90\n\nGross Profit Margin = ($2,272,433.90 / $3,956,433.90) × 100% = 0.5744 × 100% = 57.44%\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '9.66%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Gross Profit Margin': '57.44%'} }\n```",
