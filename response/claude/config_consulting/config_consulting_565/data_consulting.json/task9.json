This ratio measures a company's ability to pay off its current debt obligations with its available cash and cash equivalents.\n\nThe formula for Cash to Current Debt Ratio is:\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities\n\nStep 1: Identify the cash and cash equivalents from the balance sheet.\n- Cash on Hand: $2,103,508.95\n- Bank Deposits: $4,714,000.00\n- Total Cash and Cash Equivalents: $2,103,508.95 + $4,714,000.00 = $6,817,508.95\n\nStep 2: Identify the current liabilities from the balance sheet.\n- Total Current Liabilities: $499,821.72\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Cash to Current Debt Ratio.\n- Cash to Current Debt Ratio = $6,817,508.95 / $499,821.72 = 13.64\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the Cash to Current Debt Ratio is 13.64.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '13.64'} }\n```",
