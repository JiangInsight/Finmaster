Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's financial leverage by comparing total liabilities to shareholders' equity.\n\nFormula: Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = $499,821.72 (Total Current Liabilities)\n- Total Equity = $14,390,936.99 (Total Owner's Equity)\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $499,821.72 / $14,390,936.99 = 0.0347\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\nThis ratio measures the percentage of revenue that translates into net profit.\n\nFormula: Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = $1,390,936.99\n- Total Revenue = $3,956,433.90\n\nNet Profit Margin = ($1,390,936.99 / $3,956,433.90) × 100% = 35.16%\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to cover current liabilities with operating cash flow.\n\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the financial statements:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$1,182,491.05\n- Total Current Liabilities = $499,821.72\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -$1,182,491.05 / $499,821.72 = -2.37\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Net Profit Margin': '35.16%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.37'} }\n```",
