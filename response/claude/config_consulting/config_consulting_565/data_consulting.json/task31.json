                        "content": "I'll calculate the requested financial ratios step by step using the provided financial statements.\n\n## 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\nFormula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nSince we only have end accounts receivable and no beginning value (it was 0), I'll use the end value:\n- Net Credit Sales (Revenue): $3,956,433.90\n- Accounts Receivable: $3,149,338.94\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $3,956,433.90 / $3,149,338.94 = 1.26\n\n## 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to cover current liabilities with cash generated from operations.\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -$1,182,491.05\n- Total Current Liabilities: $499,821.72\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$1,182,491.05 / $499,821.72 = -2.37\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio we just calculated: -2.37\n\n## 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\nFormula: Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\n- Net Sales (Revenue): $3,956,433.90\n- Beginning Total Assets: $13,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets: $14,890,758.71\n- Average Total Assets: ($13,000,000.00 + $14,890,758.71) / 2 = $13,945,379.36\n\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = $3,956,433.90 / $13,945,379.36 = 0.28\n\n## 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures a company's financial leverage.\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities (Current Liabilities): $499,821.72\n- Total Equity: $14,390,936.99\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $499,821.72 / $14,390,936.99 = 0.03\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"1.26\", \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-2.37\", \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-2.37\", \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.28\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\"}}\n```",
