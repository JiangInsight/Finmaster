The recorded amount is 0.0, but the invoice description says the total is $9420.62\n2. The recorded quantity is 0.0, but the invoice says it's 1.0 unit\n3. The recorded payment/receipt_status is \"Paid\", but the invoice description says \"unpaid\"\n\nThe invoice description states: \"On February 05, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $9420.62, totaling $9420.62. The cost amount for this transaction was $5000.00, with a tax amount of $471.03, leading to a total amount due of $8949.59. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nSince invoices are generally considered more reliable due to their standardized nature, I'll use the invoice information to determine the correct values:\n- The correct amount should be $9420.62 (not 0.0)\n- The correct quantity should be 1.0 (not 0.0)\n- The correct payment status should be \"Unpaid\" (not \"Paid\")\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '1.00', 'Recorded quantity': '0.00', 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '9420.62', 'Recorded amount': '0.00', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240205070'} }\n```",
