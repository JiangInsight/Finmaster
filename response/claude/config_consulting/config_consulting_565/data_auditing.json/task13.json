Mathematical discrepancies (unit price × quantity ≠ total amount)\n2. Tax calculation errors\n3. Inconsistencies between transaction type and other fields\n4. Mismatches between invoice text and recorded data\n\nLet me examine each transaction systematically:\n\nFor the transaction with ID \"Sale20240205070\", I notice:\n1. The recorded_type is \"Financial Expenses\" but the invoice text indicates it's a \"Sale\"\n2. The tax amount is recorded as $8046.41, but according to the invoice, it should be $471.03 (calculated as 5% of the amount)\n3. This is clearly incorrect as the tax is disproportionately high for the transaction amount\n\nThe invoice states: \"On February 05, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $9420.62, totaling $9420.62. The cost amount for this transaction was $5000.00, with a tax amount of $471.03, leading to a total amount due of $8949.59.\"\n\nBut the recorded type is \"Financial Expenses\" and the recorded tax amount is $8046.41, which are both inconsistent with the invoice.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Financial Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": \"471.03\", \"Recorded tax\": \"8046.41\", \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240205070\"}}\n```",
