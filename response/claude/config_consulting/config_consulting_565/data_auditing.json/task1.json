First, I notice that `Sale20240205070` is categorized as \"Administrative Expenses\" but has all the characteristics of a sale transaction:\n   - It has product details (Standard Consulting)\n   - It shows cost amount, tax amount, profit\n   - The invoice description clearly describes a sale transaction\n   - It has a customer ID (C018)\n\n2. Looking at other records in the data, all sales transactions have a \"Sale\" recorded_type, not \"Administrative Expenses\"\n\n3. The invoice text confirms this is a sale: \"On February 05, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $9420.62...\"\n\n4. All other fields align with it being a sale transaction, including the transaction ID format (\"Sale\" prefix)\n\nSince the invoice is generally considered more reliable due to its standardized nature, and all other fields support this being a sale transaction, the \"Administrative Expenses\" category is clearly incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240205070\"}}\n```",
