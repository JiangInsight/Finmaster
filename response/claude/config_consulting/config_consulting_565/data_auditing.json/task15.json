Looking at `Purchase20231231018`:\n   - It's labeled as \"Administrative Expenses\" in the `recorded_type` field\n   - The invoice states: \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Purchase, consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $100000.00, totaling $200000.00.\"\n   - But the `recorded_amount` is only $100,000\n   - The `recorded_quantity` is 1.0, which doesn't match the 2.0 units mentioned in the invoice\n   - The transaction type is wrong (should be Purchase, not Administrative Expenses)\n   - The amount is wrong (should be $200,000, not $100,000)\n   - This strongly suggests errors in both the category and quantity fields\n\nTherefore, the inconsistencies in this record are:\n1. The recorded category is \"Administrative Expenses\" but should be \"Purchase\"\n2. The recorded quantity is 1.0 but should be 2.0\n3. The recorded amount is $100,000 but should be $200,000 (though I'm not including this in my response as the task specifies to focus on the incorrect fields that impact other calculations)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Purchase\", \"Recorded category\": \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"2.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Purchase20231231018\"}}\n```",
