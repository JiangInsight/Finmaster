Additionally, the payment status is recorded as \"Paid\" but the invoice states it was \"unpaid\".\n\n## Scanning through other transactions\nI don't see any other obvious inconsistencies where the recorded values differ from what's stated in the invoice field. Most transactions have consistent information between their recorded fields and what's described in the invoice.\n\nTherefore, I've identified only one transaction with inconsistencies:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '419.64', 'Recorded amount': '472.82', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Interest20240126026'} }\n```",
