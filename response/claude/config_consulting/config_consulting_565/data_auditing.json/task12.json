Fields where the recorded information doesn't match what appears in the invoice description\n2. Fields where information is missing but should be present based on the invoice\n3. Inconsistencies between related fields\n4. The invoice field is considered more reliable when there are discrepancies\n\nLet me go through the data and identify any inconsistencies:\n\nLooking at the transactions, I've found one clear inconsistency:\n\nFor transaction ID \"Expense20240105001\" (Administrative Expenses), the approver field is empty, but in the invoice description it states \"This transaction was prepared by Staff, and the approver is Director.\" \n\nThe invoice is considered more reliable, so this is an inconsistency where the recorded_approver field should have contained \"Director\" but is missing this information.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": \"Director\", \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Expense20240105001\"}}\n```",
