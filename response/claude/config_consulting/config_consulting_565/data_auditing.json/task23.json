Date discrepancy: The invoice states \"On February 03, 2024,\" but the recorded date is \"2024-02-20\"\n2. Amount discrepancy: The invoice states \"totaling $2285.80,\" but the recorded amount is \"2669.86\"\n\nThis is clearly an inconsistency where both the date and amount recorded differ from what's in the invoice.\n\nFor other transactions, I checked the consistency between recorded values and invoice descriptions, but did not find other clear inconsistencies.\n\nTherefore, the inconsistency for Expense20240203001 should be reported:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": \"2024-02-03\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-02-20\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"2285.80\", \"Recorded amount\": \"2669.86\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Expense20240203001\"}}\n```",
