For these transactions, the recorded receive method needs to match what's stated in the invoice.\n\nLet me check the Interest20240112012 transaction:\n- The recorded_receive_method is listed as \"Cash\"\n- But in the invoice, it states: \"The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable\"\n\nThis is clearly inconsistent. The recorded receive method should be \"Interest receviable\" based on the invoice description, not \"Cash\".\n\nExamining other similar transactions, I can see that most interest receivables transactions correctly have \"Interest receviable\" as the recorded_receive_method, which matches their invoice descriptions.\n\nSince the invoice is considered more reliable due to its standardized nature, the correct value for the recorded_receive_method should be \"Interest receviable\" for this transaction.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': 'Interest receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Cash', 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Interest20240112012'} }\n```",
