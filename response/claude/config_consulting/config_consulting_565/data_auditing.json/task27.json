The recorded_type is \"Financial Expenses\" but the invoice clearly states it's a \"Sale\"\n2. The recorded_amount is $62886.14, but the invoice says the total is $53996.18\n3. The recorded_unit_price is $48466.98, but the invoice mentions $53996.18\n\nLet me verify this by examining the invoice text:\n\"On January 19, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $53996.18, totaling $53996.18. The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $2699.81, leading to a total amount due of $51296.37. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nThis confirms the discrepancies. The correct values should be:\n- Type: Sale (not Financial Expenses)\n- Amount: $53996.18 (not $62886.14)\n- Unit price: $53996.18 (not $48466.98)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Financial Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '53996.18', 'Recorded price': '48466.98', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '53996.18', 'Recorded amount': '62886.14', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240119040'} }\n```",
