If the recorded amount matches quantity Ã— unit price\n2. If tax calculations are correct \n3. If after-tax amounts are consistent\n4. If profit calculations make sense\n5. If there are discrepancies between the invoice text and the structured data\n\nLooking at Sale20240204069, I notice several discrepancies:\n- The recorded amount is $66,937.39\n- The recorded quantity is 0\n- The recorded unit price is $53,858.13\n- The recorded tax amount is $43,249.96\n\nWhen I check the invoice text: \"On February 04, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $55666.23, totaling $55666.23. The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $2783.31, leading to a total amount due of $52882.92.\"\n\nThis shows clear inconsistencies:\n- The actual quantity should be 1.0 (not 0)\n- The actual unit price should be $55,666.23 (not $53,858.13)\n- The actual total amount should be $55,666.23 (not $66,937.39)\n- The actual tax amount should be $2,783.31 (not $43,249.96)\n\nSince the invoice text is considered more reliable due to its standardized nature, I'll use that to determine the correct values.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"1.00\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"0.00\", \"Original price\": \"55666.23\", \"Recorded price\": \"53858.13\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"55666.23\", \"Recorded amount\": \"66937.39\", \"Original tax\": \"2783.31\", \"Recorded tax\": \"43249.96\", \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240204069\"}}\n```",
