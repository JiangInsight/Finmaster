I'll focus particularly on the invoice field which is considered more reliable.\n\nLet me start by examining the transactions one by one, looking for discrepancies:\n\nFor transaction `Interest20240114014`, I notice several issues:\n1. The category in the record is \"Depreciation\" but in the invoice it mentions \"Interest Receivables\"\n2. The date in the record is \"2024-02-07\" but the invoice refers to \"January 14, 2024\"\n3. The amount is recorded as $509.72, but the invoice states $424.08\n\nLooking at the details in the invoice description: \"On January 14, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Interest Receivables, totaling $424.08. The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nThis clearly indicates that the correct values should be:\n- Category: Interest Receivables (not Depreciation)\n- Date: 2024-01-14 (not 2024-02-07)\n- Amount: $424.08 (not $509.72)\n\nSince the invoice is considered more reliable, these discrepancies represent errors in the recorded fields.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Interest Receivables', 'Recorded category': 'Depreciation', 'Original date': '2024-01-14', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-07', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '424.08', 'Recorded amount': '509.72', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Interest20240114014'} }\n```",
