The invoice indicates the tax amount should be $2,250.44.\n\nThe invoice text is considered more reliable, and it clearly states:\n\"On January 09, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $45008.76, totaling $45008.76. The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $2250.44, leading to a total amount due of $42758.32. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, I can compile the inconsistencies for this transaction:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-09\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-18\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Original price\": \"45008.76\", \"Recorded price\": \"40936.88\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\", \"Original amount\": \"45008.76\", \"Recorded amount\": \"50202.93\", \"Original tax\": \"2250.44\", \"Recorded tax\": \"44912.25\", \"Original profit\": \"25008.76\", \"Recorded profit\": \"25008.76\", \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240109017\"}}\n```",
