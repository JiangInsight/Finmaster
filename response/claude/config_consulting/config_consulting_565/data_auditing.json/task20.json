The recorded_type is \"Administrative Expenses\" but the invoice clearly describes it as a \"Sale\"\n2. The recorded_unit_price ($16373.34) doesn't match what should be expected based on other fields\n\nAccording to the invoice details:\n- It's a Sale transaction (not Administrative Expenses)\n- Unit price should be $14983.40 (which matches the recorded_amount)\n- The transaction includes cost, tax, and profit information typical of sales transactions\n\nLooking at the after_tax_amount ($14234.23) and tax_amount ($749.17), these align with a unit price of $14983.40, not the recorded $16373.34.\n\nI also examined all other transactions in the dataset but did not find additional inconsistencies where invoice information contradicted recorded fields.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"14983.4\", \"Recorded price\": \"16373.34\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240122045\"}}\n```",
