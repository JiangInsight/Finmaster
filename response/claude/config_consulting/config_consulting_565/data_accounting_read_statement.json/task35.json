                        "content": "I need to identify four specific line items from the income statement:\n\n1. Costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services (Selling Expenses)\n2. Financing costs incurred for production and operation (Financial Expenses)\n3. Systematic allocation of depreciable assets over useful life (Depreciation)\n4. Total taxes expected to pay/recover in reporting period (Tax Expense)\n\nLooking at the income statement:\n\n- Selling Expenses = 360961.15\n- Depreciation = 91503.27\n- Financial Expenses = 81394.22\n- Tax Expense = 197821.72\n\nThese values correspond to the four specific line items requested, and I'll maintain the original order as shown in the statement.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '360961.15', 'value2': '81394.22', 'value3': '91503.27', 'value4': '197821.72'}}\n```\n\nWait, I need to check the ordering again. Looking at the expected output format from the example, it seems the order should be:\n1. Selling Expenses (costs to secure customer orders)\n2. Depreciation (systematic allocation of asset value)\n3. Financial Expenses (financing costs)\n4. Tax Expense (total taxes)\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '360961.15', 'value2': '91503.27', 'value3': '81394.22', 'value4': '197821.72'}}\n```",
