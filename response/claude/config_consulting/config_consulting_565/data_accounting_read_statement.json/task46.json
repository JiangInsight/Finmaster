The negative sign is a standard accounting convention to show cash outflows, but the amount is zero.\n\nTherefore:\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -0.00\n- Sub-item (Purchase of Fixed Assets): 0.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '0.00'}}}\n```",
