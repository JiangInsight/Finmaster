The net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement to locate these values:\n\n### Balance Sheet\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, I see \"Interest Receivable\" with an end amount of $15,414.09. This represents interest that has been accrued but not yet received.\n\n### Income Statement\nThe Income Statement shows \"Interest Income\" of $15,414.09, which matches the Interest Receivable on the Balance Sheet.\n\n### Cash Flow Statement\nThe Cash Flow Statement shows the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents as $-1,182,491.05. The negative sign indicates a decrease rather than an addition.\n\nTherefore:\n1. Interest accrued but not yet received = $15,414.09 (from Interest Receivable)\n2. Net addition in cash and cash equivalents = $-1,182,491.05 (from Net Increase in the Cash Flow Statement)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '15414.09', 'value2': '-1182491.05'} }\n```",
