Reduction in amounts of assets held for sale (Inventory change)\n3. Net cash from investing activities (acquisition/disposal of assets)\n4. Net addition in cash and cash equivalents (Net Increase)\n\nLet me analyze the given cash flow statement:\n\n1. Depreciation: This appears as \"Depreciation\" with a value of 91503.27\n2. Inventory change: This appears as \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with a value of -0.00\n3. Net cash from investing activities: This appears as \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with a value of -0.00\n4. Net increase in cash: This appears as \"Net Increase\" with a value of -1182491.05\n\nTherefore, the four values I need to extract are:\n- value1: 91503.27 (Depreciation)\n- value2: -0.00 (Inventory change)\n- value3: -0.00 (Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities)\n- value4: -1182491.05 (Net Increase)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91503.27', 'value2': '-0.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '-1182491.05'}}\n```",
