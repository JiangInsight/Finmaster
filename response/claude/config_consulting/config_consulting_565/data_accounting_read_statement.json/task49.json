Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services (Accounts Payable)\n2. Acquisition of property, plant and equipment (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n3. Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period (Beginning Balance)\n\nLet me find these values from the given cash flow statement:\n\n1. For the addition in accounts payable, I can see \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with a value of 302000.00\n2. For acquisition of property/equipment, I can see \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of 0.00\n3. For cash at beginning of period, I can see \"Beginning Balance\" with a value of 8000000.00\n\nTherefore, the three values I need to extract are:\n- value1: 302000.00 (Accounts Payable)\n- value2: 0.00 (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n- value3: 8000000.00 (Beginning Balance)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '302000.00', 'value2': '0.00', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
