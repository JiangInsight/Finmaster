These are long-term physical assets that match the description in the task.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial value of Fixed Assets: 5000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- End value of Fixed Assets: 5000000.00 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\nI notice that while the gross Fixed Assets value remains the same, there is \"Accumulated Depreciation\" of 91503.27 at the end date. However, the task specifically asks for the line items of tangible items, which corresponds to the Fixed Assets line, not the net value after depreciation.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5000000.00'}}\n```",
