Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit - this is Accounts Receivable from the Balance Sheet\n2. Financing costs incurred by the enterprise - this is Financial Expenses from the Income Statement\n3. Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment - this is Purchase of Fixed Assets from the Cash Flow Statement\n\nLet's identify the values for each:\n\n1. From the Balance Sheet, I see \"Accounts Receivable\" has an end amount of 3149338.94\n2. From the Income Statement, I see \"Financial Expenses\" has an amount of 81394.22\n3. From the Cash Flow Statement, I see \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" has an amount of 0.00\n\nTherefore, the three specific values are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3149338.94', 'value2': '81394.22', 'value3': '0.00'} }\n```",
