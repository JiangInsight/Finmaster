Total Revenue: 3956433.90\n2. Cost of Goods Sold: 1684000.00\n3. Total Expenses: 699089.28\n4. Interest Income: 15414.09\n5. Tax Expense: 197821.72\n\nThese components reflect the key elements involved in the calculation of net profit:\n- Revenue (inflow)\n- Cost of goods sold (major outflow)\n- Operating expenses (outflow)\n- Interest income (inflow)\n- Tax expense (outflow)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1390936.99', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '3956433.90', 'sub_item value2': '1684000.00', 'sub_item value3': '699089.28', 'sub_item value4': '15414.09', 'sub_item value5': '197821.72'}}}\n```",
