In this case, the Gross Profit line item shows 2,272,433.90, which is exactly the difference between Total Revenue and Total Cost.\n\nLet me verify the calculation:\n3,956,433.90 - 1,684,000.00 = 2,272,433.90\n\nTherefore, the value of the difference between revenue and cost is 2,272,433.90.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2272433.90'}}\n```",
