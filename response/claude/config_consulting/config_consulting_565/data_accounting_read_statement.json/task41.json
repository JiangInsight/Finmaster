This represents the increase in tax that has been accrued but not yet paid, which is exactly what the task is asking for.\n\nThe positive value indicates an increase in the tax payable, meaning more tax has been accrued than was paid during this period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '197821.72'}}\n```",
