Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense - this would be \"Profit Before Tax\" from the Income Statement\n2. Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit - this would be \"Accounts Payable\" from the Balance Sheet\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares - this would be \"Paid-in Capital\" from the Balance Sheet\n\nLet's extract the end values for each:\n\n1. From the Income Statement, \"Profit Before Tax\" is 1588758.71\n2. From the Balance Sheet, \"Accounts Payable\" shows an end amount of 302000.00\n3. From the Balance Sheet, \"Paid-in Capital\" shows an end amount of 13000000.00\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1588758.71', 'value3': '302000.00'}}\n```",
