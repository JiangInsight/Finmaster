This is the cash that would be considered available for operational use.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand: Initial amount = 3,000,000.00 (dated 2023-12-31)\n- Cash on Hand: End amount = 2,103,508.95 (dated 2024-02-05)\n\nWhile \"Bank Deposits\" could also be considered part of cash and cash equivalents, the question specifically asks for cash available for day-to-day operations, which most directly corresponds to \"Cash on Hand\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '3000000.00', 'end value': '2103508.95'}}\n```",
