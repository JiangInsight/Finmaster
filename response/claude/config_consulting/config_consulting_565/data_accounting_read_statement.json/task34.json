Total income arising in the course of an entity's ordinary activities\n   - This corresponds to \"Total Revenue\" which is 3956433.90\n\n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period\n   - This corresponds to \"Cost of Goods Sold\" which is 1684000.00\n\n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole\n   - This corresponds to \"Administrative Expenses\" which is 165230.64\n\nNow I'll extract these values and format the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3956433.90', 'value2': '1684000.00', 'value3': '165230.64'}}\n```",
