These are obligations that will be paid within one year or within the operating cycle.\n\nIn the balance sheet provided, I can see the line item \"Total Current Liabilities\" which represents exactly what I'm looking for:\n\n1. Initial value (as of 2023-12-31): 0.00\n2. End value (as of 2024-02-05): 499821.72\n\nThis \"Total Current Liabilities\" represents the sum of \"Accounts Payable\" (302000.00) and \"Taxes Payable\" (197821.72), which are both short-term liabilities expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '499821.72'}}\n```",
