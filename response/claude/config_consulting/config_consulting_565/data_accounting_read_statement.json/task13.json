In this balance sheet, these are clearly labeled as \"Total Non-current Assets\".\n\nThe initial value for Total Non-current Assets is 5000000.00 as of 2023-12-31.\nThe end value for Total Non-current Assets is 4908496.73 as of 2024-02-05.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '4908496.73'}}\n```",
