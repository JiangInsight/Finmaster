When this value is positive, it indicates a decrease in inventory (reduction in assets held for sale), and when negative, it indicates an increase.\n\nFrom the given statement, I can see:\n- (Increase) Decrease in Inventory: -0.00\n\nThis value indicates there was essentially no change in inventory during the period. The value is shown as \"-0.00\", which technically represents zero change in inventory.\n\nSince there was no reduction in inventory (assets held for sale), the value I should report is \"-0.00\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00'}}\n```",
