Let's analyze the transactions systematically to calculate each component of the cash flow statement.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze revenue and expense transactions to calculate Net Profit\n\nFirst, I'll identify sales, expenses, depreciation, and interest transactions to calculate net profit.\n\nSales (Revenue):\n- All \"Sale\" transactions = 2,702.73 + 2,767.58 + 2,029.81 + 187,782.17 + 246,016.59 + ... (adding all sales)\n- Total Sales: 3,089,321.06\n\nExpenses:\n- Administrative Expenses: 2,114.13 + 18,579.64 + 7,334.11 + ... = 228,022.85\n- Sales Expenses: 19,870.28 + 9,101.97 + 18,224.98 + ... = 356,564.48\n- Financial Expenses: 12,133.89 + 15,552.40 + 13,328.23 + ... = 61,270.93\n- Total Expenses: 645,858.26\n\nDepreciation:\n- 45,751.67 (from 2024-01-01) + 45,751.60 (from 2024-02-01) = 91,503.27\n\nInterest Receivables:\n- Total Interest Income: 13,756.19\n\nCost of Goods Sold:\n- Based on the profit figures in sales transactions = 1,422,000.00\n\nNet Profit = Revenue - Expenses - COGS - Depreciation + Interest\nNet Profit = 3,089,321.06 - 645,858.26 - 1,422,000.00 - 91,503.27 + 13,756.19 = 943,715.72\n\n## Step 2: Calculate changes in working capital accounts\n\n(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable:\n- Initial: 0\n- Final (sum of unpaid sales): 2,702.73 + 2,767.58 + 2,029.81 + 187,782.17 + 246,016.59 + ... = 2,491,534.07\n- Change: -2,491,534.07 (negative because it's an increase)\n\n(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable:\n- Initial: 0\n- Final (sum of unpaid interest): 13,756.19\n- Change: -13,756.19 (negative because it's an increase)\n\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory:\n- Initial: 0\n- Final (based on purchased products): 1,512,000.00\n- Change: -1,512,000.00\n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Accounts Payable:\n- Initial: 0\n- Final (unpaid purchases): 2,000.00 + 60,000.00 + 200,000.00 + 40,000.00 = 302,000.00\n- Change: 302,000.00\n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Tax Payable:\n- Initial: 0\n- Final (sum of tax amounts in sales): 154,425.85\n- Change: 154,425.85\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = Net Profit + Depreciation + Changes in Working Capital\n= 943,715.72 + 91,503.27 - 2,491,534.07 - 13,756.19 - 1,512,000.00 + 302,000.00 + 154,425.85\n= -2,525,645.42\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n\nPurchase of Fixed Assets:\n- Initial fixed assets: 5,000,000.00\n- No additional purchases identified\n\nNet Cash Flow from Investing Activities = 0.00\n\n## Step 5: Calculate Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nBeginning Balance:\n- Initial Cash: 3,000,000.00\n- Initial Bank: 5,000,000.00\n- Total Beginning Balance: 8,000,000.00\n\nCash outflows (payments):\n- Paid purchases: 1,212,000.00\n- Paid expenses: 645,858.26\n- Total cash outflows: 1,857,858.26\n\nCash inflows (receipts):\n- Paid sales: 610,720.65\n\nNet Cash Flow = Beginning Balance + Cash inflows - Cash outflows\n= 8,000,000.00 + 610,720.65 - 1,857,858.26\n= 6,752,862.39\n\nEnding Balance = 6,752,862.39\n\nNet Increase = Ending Balance - Beginning Balance\n= 6,752,862.39 - 8,000,000.00\n= -1,247,137.61\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll now present the cash flow statement:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Net Profit\": \"943,715.72\", \"Depreciation\": \"91,503.27\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-2,491,534.07\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-13,756.19\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-1,512,000.00\", \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"302,000.00\", \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"154,425.85\", \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-2,525,645.42\", \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"0.00\", \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": \"0.00\", \"Beginning Balance\": \"8,000,000.00\", \"Ending Balance\": \"6,752,862.39\", \"Net Increase\": \"-1,247,137.61\"}}\n```\n\nLet me format the numbers without commas to match the expected format:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Net Profit\": \"943715.72\", \"Depreciation\": \"91503.27\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-2491534.07\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-13756.19\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-1512000.00\", \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"302000.00\", \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"154425.85\", \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-2525645.42\", \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"0.00\", \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": \"0.00\", \"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\", \"Ending Balance\": \"6752862.39\", \"Net Increase\": \"-1247137.61\"}}",
