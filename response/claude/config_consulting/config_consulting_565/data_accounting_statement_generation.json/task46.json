To do this, I'll analyze the initial cash and bank deposits from the transaction data.\n\nLooking at the transaction data, I can see that on December 31, 2023 (2023-12-31), there were initial deposits:\n\n1. Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | 3,000,000.0\n2. Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 5,000,000.0\n\nThese two transactions represent the initial cash and cash equivalents balance. Cash equivalents typically include highly liquid investments like bank deposits.\n\nThe total beginning balance would be the sum of these two amounts:\nCash deposit: 3,000,000.00\nBank deposit: 5,000,000.00\nTotal: 8,000,000.00\n\nThis amount represents the beginning cash and cash equivalents balance that would appear in the cash flow statement.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
