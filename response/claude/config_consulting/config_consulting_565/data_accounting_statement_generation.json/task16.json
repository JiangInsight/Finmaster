The total initial paid-in capital is therefore:\n3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 13,000,000.00\n\nNext, I need to check if there were any additional capital contributions or withdrawals during the period that would affect the paid-in capital.\n\nAfter reviewing all transactions in the dataset, I don't see any additional capital contributions from shareholders or any capital withdrawals. There are various sales, purchases, expenses, interest receivables, and depreciation entries, but none that would change the paid-in capital amount.\n\nThe transactions labeled \"Transfer\" are transfers between cash and bank accounts, which don't affect the total paid-in capital.\n\nSince there were no changes to the paid-in capital during the period, the ending value remains the same as the initial value: 13,000,000.00.\n\nTherefore, the paid-in capital values are:\n- Initial Value: 13,000,000.00\n- End Value: 13,000,000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
