Current liabilities typically include accounts payable, unpaid expenses, and other short-term obligations.\n\nFirst, I'll look for initial liabilities and then find all transactions that would create or affect liabilities by the end of the period.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the types of transactions that create current liabilities\nThe main current liabilities to look for:\n- Unpaid purchases (Account Payable)\n- Interest payable\n- Any other short-term obligations marked as unpaid\n\n## Step 2: Check for initial liabilities\nLooking at the initial balance entries (Initial20231231001), there are no explicit current liabilities mentioned at the beginning. So the initial value appears to be 0.\n\n## Step 3: Identify all unpaid purchase transactions that are marked as \"Unpaid\" with \"Account Payable\"\nI'll review all purchase transactions:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001: 2,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n2. Purchase20231231007: 60,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)  \n3. Purchase20231231016: 200,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n4. Purchase20231231020: 40,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n\nTotal unpaid purchases: 2,000 + 60,000 + 200,000 + 40,000 = 302,000.00\n\n## Step 4: Identify all interest receivables\nAlthough interest receivables are shown in the data, these would be assets (not liabilities), so they don't contribute to current liabilities.\n\n## Step 5: Check for any other current liabilities\nGoing through the transactions, I don't see any other transactions that would create additional current liabilities beyond the unpaid purchases identified above.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total current liabilities at the end of the period\nThe total current liabilities at the end of the period is the sum of all unpaid purchases and any other short-term payables:\n\nTotal Current Liabilities End Value = 302,000.00\n\n## Summary\n- Total Current Liabilities Initial Value: 0.00\n- Total Current Liabilities End Value: 302,000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', 'Total Current Liabilities End Value': '302000.00'} }\n```",
