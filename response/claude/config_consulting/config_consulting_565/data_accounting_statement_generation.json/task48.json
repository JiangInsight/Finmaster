This involves tracking all cash inflows and outflows during the period.\n\nLet me start by identifying the initial cash balances:\n- Initial cash deposit: $3,000,000.00\n- Initial bank deposit: $5,000,000.00\n- Total initial cash and cash equivalents: $8,000,000.00\n\nNow I'll analyze all transactions affecting cash:\n\n1. **Cash Inflows:**\n   - Sales with cash payments (receive_method = \"Cash\")\n   - Interest received in cash\n   - Any other cash receipts\n\n2. **Cash Outflows:**\n   - Expenses paid in cash\n   - Purchases paid in cash/bank transfer\n   - Any cash transfers or other cash payments\n\nLet me identify and sum up all the relevant transactions:\n\nCash Sales (Cash inflows):\n- Sale20240115030: $2,079.52\n- Sale20240116033: $262,369.80\n- Sale20240118038: $196,674.49\n- Sale20240120042: $275,321.52\n- Sale20240122045: $14,983.40\n- Sale20240204069: $55,666.23\nTotal Cash Sales: $807,094.96\n\nCash Expenses (Cash outflows):\n- Expense20240101001 (Sales Expenses): $19,870.28\n- Expense20240101001 (Administrative Expenses): $2,114.13\n- Expense20240102001 (Sales Expenses): $9,101.97\n- Expense20240102001 (Sales Expenses): $18,224.98\n- Expense20240103001 (Administrative Expenses): $18,579.64\n- Expense20240103001 (Administrative Expenses): $7,334.11\n- Expense20240104001 (Sales Expenses): $17,872.03\n- Expense20240105001 (Administrative Expenses): $2,928.40\n- Expense20240105001 (Sales Expenses): $14,588.99\n- Expense20240106001 (Sales Expenses): $8,281.46\n- Expense20240107001 (Sales Expenses): $5,212.63\n- Expense20240107001 (Sales Expenses): $4,613.02\n- Expense20240108001 (Sales Expenses): $11,443.14\n- Expense20240109001 (Financial Expenses): $12,133.89\n- Expense20240110001 (Sales Expenses): $17,779.73\n- Expense20240111001 (Sales Expenses): $3,937.02\n- Expense20240112001 (Administrative Expenses): $16,185.87\n- Expense20240112001 (Sales Expenses): $6,956.35\n- Expense20240113001 (Sales Expenses): $11,218.42\n- Expense20240114001 (Administrative Expenses): $14,999.27\n- Expense20240115001 (Sales Expenses): $7,625.62\n- Expense20240116001 (Financial Expenses): $15,552.40\n- Expense20240116001 (Sales Expenses): $18,183.56\n- Expense20240117001 (Sales Expenses): $8,139.11\n- Expense20240117001 (Administrative Expenses): $19,782.71\n- Expense20240118001 (Sales Expenses): $18,791.29\n- Expense20240119001 (Sales Expenses): $16,577.94\n- Expense20240119001 (Administrative Expenses): $10,111.54\n- Expense20240120001 (Sales Expenses): $9,285.32\n- Expense20240120001 (Sales Expenses): $19,721.98\n- Expense20240121001 (Administrative Expenses): $17,283.46\n- Expense20240122001 (Financial Expenses): $5,817.31\n- Expense20240123001 (Financial Expenses): $13,328.23\n- Expense20240124001 (Sales Expenses): $12,101.39\n- Expense20240125001 (Sales Expenses): $13,067.33\n- Expense20240125001 (Sales Expenses): $10,616.52\n- Expense20240126001 (Sales Expenses): $17,487.41\n- Expense20240127001 (Sales Expenses): $4,377.51\n- Expense20240127001 (Financial Expenses): $14,631.91\n- Expense20240128001 (Financial Expenses): $19,930.48\n- Expense20240128001 (Sales Expenses): $5,863.41\n- Expense20240129001 (Sales Expenses): $13,772.83\n- Expense20240130001 (Administrative Expenses): $8,231.46\n- Expense20240130001 (Administrative Expenses): $15,204.39\n- Expense20240131001 (Sales Expenses): $15,276.33\n- Expense20240201001 (Administrative Expenses): $11,100.38\n- Expense20240202001 (Administrative Expenses): $3,768.56\n- Expense20240203001 (Sales Expenses): $2,285.80\n- Expense20240203001 (Sales Expenses): $7,952.47\n- Expense20240204001 (Administrative Expenses): $3,715.60\n- Expense20240204001 (Administrative Expenses): $11,844.44\n- Expense20240205001 (Administrative Expenses): $2,046.68\n- Expense20240205001 (Sales Expenses): $10,735.31\nTotal Cash Expenses: $610,407.99\n\nCash Purchases (Cash outflows):\n- Purchase20231231003: $200,000.00\n- Purchase20231231008: $60,000.00\n- Purchase20231231009: $300,000.00\n- Purchase20231231017: $1,000.00\n- Purchase20231231018: $200,000.00\n- Purchase20231231019: $300,000.00\n- Purchase20231231021: $20,000.00\nTotal Cash Purchases: $1,081,000.00\n\nBank Transfer Purchases (Cash outflows):\n- Purchase20231231002: $1,000.00\n- Purchase20231231004: $1,000.00\n- Purchase20231231005: $20,000.00\n- Purchase20231231006: $10,000.00\n- Purchase20231231010: $3,000.00\n- Purchase20231231011: $200,000.00\n- Purchase20231231013: $10,000.00\n- Purchase20231231015: $20,000.00\n- Purchase20231231022: $1,000.00\nTotal Bank Transfer Purchases: $266,000.00\n\nThe net increase in cash and cash equivalents is:\nInitial cash and cash equivalents: $8,000,000.00\n+ Cash Sales: $807,094.96\n- Cash Expenses: $610,407.99\n- Cash Purchases: $1,081,000.00\n- Bank Transfer Purchases: $266,000.00\n\nNet Increase = ($8,000,000.00 + $807,094.96) -
