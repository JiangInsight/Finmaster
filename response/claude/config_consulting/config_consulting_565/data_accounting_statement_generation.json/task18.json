Owner's equity equals assets minus liabilities.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the initial equity and then track all the transactions that would affect it (revenues, expenses, etc.).\n\n## Step 1: Identify the initial owner's equity\nLooking at the initial deposits:\n- Cash deposit: $3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: $5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets: $5,000,000.00\n\nTotal initial value: $13,000,000.00\n\n## Step 2: Identify all transactions affecting equity through the period\nTransactions that affect equity:\n- Sales (increase equity through profit)\n- Expenses (decrease equity)\n- Depreciation (decrease equity)\n- Interest receivables (increase equity)\n\n### Sales revenue and profit\nI need to sum all the profit from sales:\n```\nSum of profits from all sales = Sum of all \"profit\" values\n```\n\nLet me add up all the profit values:\n1.

This seems reasonable since our dataset shows significant profits from sales with relatively controlled expenses.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Owners Equity Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Total Owners Equity End Value': '14593859.56'} }\n```",
