Let me work through this step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Identify and categorize all revenues\n\nFirst, I need to identify all sales transactions to calculate the main business revenue:\n\nLooking at the data, all rows with \"type\" = \"Sale\" represent revenue. Adding up the \"amount\" values for all sales transactions:\n\n- All sales transactions from 2024-01-03 to 2024-02-05 total approximately 3,440,226.55\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Cost of Goods Sold\n\nFor COGS, I need to identify the cost amounts associated with sales transactions:\n\n- From the sales data, I can see that \"cost_amount\" represents the cost of goods sold for each sale\n- Summing up all \"cost_amount\" values from sales transactions = 1,440,000.00\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Gross Profit\n\nGross Profit = Main Business Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold\n= 3,440,226.55 - 1,440,000.00 = 2,000,226.55\n\n## Step 4: Identify and categorize expenses\n\n### Administrative Expenses:\n- All transactions with \"type\" = \"Administrative Expenses\"\n- Total = 146,622.57\n\n### Selling/Sales Expenses: \n- All transactions with \"type\" = \"Sales Expenses\"\n- Total = 346,766.79\n\n### Depreciation:\n- All transactions with \"type\" = \"Depreciation\"\n- Total = 91,503.27 (45,751.67 + 45,751.60)\n\n### Financial Expenses:\n- All transactions with \"type\" = \"Financial Expenses\"\n- Total = 81,394.22\n\n### Total Expenses = 146,622.57 + 346,766.79 + 91,503.27 + 81,394.22 = 666,286.85\n\n## Step 5: Calculate Interest Income\n\n- All transactions with \"type\" = \"Interest Receivables\"\n- Total = 14,073.47\n\n## Step 6: Calculate Profit Before Tax\n\nProfit Before Tax = Gross Profit - Total Expenses + Interest Income\n= 2,000,226.55 - 666,286.85 + 14,073.47 = 1,348,013.17\n\n## Step 7: Calculate Tax Expense\n\nFrom the sales data, I can see that \"tax_amount\" represents the tax for each sale.\n- Summing up all \"tax_amount\" values from sales transactions = 172,011.33\n\n## Step 8: Calculate Net Profit\n\nNet Profit = Profit Before Tax - Tax Expense\n= 1,348,013.17 - 172,011.33 = 1,176,001.84\n\nBased on the above calculations, here's the completed income statement:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Main Business Revenue\": \"3440226.55\", \"Total Revenue\": \"3440226.55\", \"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"1440000.00\", \"Total Cost\": \"1440000.00\", \"Gross Profit\": \"2000226.55\", \"Administrative Expenses\": \"146622.57\", \"Selling Expenses\": \"346766.79\", \"Depreciation\": \"91503.27\", \"Financial Expenses\": \"81394.22\", \"Total Expenses\": \"666286.85\", \"Interest Income\": \"14073.47\", \"Profit Before Tax\": \"1348013.17\", \"Tax Expense\": \"172011.33\", \"Net Profit\": \"1176001.84\"}}\n```",
