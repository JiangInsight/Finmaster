However, I don't see any transactions in the data that would qualify as fixed asset additions.\n\nGiven the lack of asset additions in the problem data, I'll provide the calculation based on the evidence seen:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '4908496.73'}}",
