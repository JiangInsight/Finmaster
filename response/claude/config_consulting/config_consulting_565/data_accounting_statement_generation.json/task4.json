We need to identify all sales transactions where payment is marked as \"Unpaid\" and the receive method is \"Account Receivable\".\n\n## Step 2: Determine the initial AR value\nFirst, I'll check if there are any initial AR values specified in the initial transactions on 2023-12-31. Looking at the initial entries:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00\n\nThere's no specific entry for initial accounts receivable, so the initial value is 0.00.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the final AR value\nI'll identify all sales transactions where:\n- Payment/receipt status is \"Unpaid\"\n- Receive method is \"Account Receivable\"\n\nHere are all such transactions I found in chronological order:\n\n1.

In this dataset, I don't see any transactions indicating receivables being paid, so I don't need to subtract any collections.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the final AR value\nThe initial AR value is 0.00, and the sum of all unpaid sales with receive method as \"Account Receivable\" is 3,153,339.14.\n\nTherefore, the final AR value is 3,153,339.14.\n\nActually, let me double-check this by verifying all transactions. Looking more carefully at the dataset, I notice that:\n- We start with 0 AR on Dec 31, 2023\n- All the sales I listed above are marked \"Unpaid\" with \"Account Receivable\" as the receive method\n- I don't see any transactions showing receivables being collected or written off\n\nThe accounts receivable end value is 3,153,339.14.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accounts Receivable End Value': '3153339.14'} }\n```",
