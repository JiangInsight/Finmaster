I should look for transactions that specifically reference fixed asset purchases.\n\nLet me analyze the data for any fixed asset purchase transactions:\n\nReviewing all the transactions in the problem dataset, I don't see any specific transaction types labeled as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\". Unlike the example problem which had a transaction labeled \"FixedAsset20231231001\" with type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\", the current problem doesn't contain transactions with that specific type.\n\nThe closest transaction related to fixed assets in the problem data is:\n- Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0\n\nHowever, this appears to be an initial balance sheet entry for existing fixed assets rather than a purchase transaction. This represents the starting balance of fixed assets, not a cash outflow for new acquisitions.\n\nAfter examining all transactions in the problem dataset, I don't find any specific purchases of fixed assets that would be reported in the cash flow statement as outflows for the period.\n\nSince there are no fixed asset purchase transactions in the period covered by the transactions, the answer would be 0.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '0'} }\n```",
