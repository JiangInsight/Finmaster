A negative number would indicate an increase in inventory (cash outflow), while a positive number would represent a decrease in inventory (cash inflow).\n\nStep 1: First, I'll identify all inventory purchase transactions.\nLooking through the data, I can see all the purchase transactions labeled as \"Purchase\" in the type column.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total purchase amount.\n```\nPurchase20231231001: 2,000.00\nPurchase20231231002: 1,000.00\nPurchase20231231003: 200,000.00\nPurchase20231231004: 1,000.00\nPurchase20231231005: 20,000.00\nPurchase20231231006: 10,000.00\nPurchase20231231007: 60,000.00\nPurchase20231231008: 60,000.00\nPurchase20231231009: 300,000.00\nPurchase20231231010: 3,000.00\nPurchase20231231011: 200,000.00\nPurchase20231231012: 20,000.00\nPurchase20231231013: 10,000.00\nPurchase20231231014: 15,000.00\nPurchase20231231015: 20,000.00\nPurchase20231231016: 200,000.00\nPurchase20231231017: 1,000.00\nPurchase20231231018: 200,000.00\nPurchase20231231019: 300,000.00\nPurchase20231231020: 40,000.00\nPurchase20231231021: 20,000.00\nPurchase20231231022: 1,000.00\n```\n\nTotal purchases: 1,684,000.00\n\nStep 3: Identify all sales transactions and the associated cost of goods sold.\nFor each sale, the cost_amount column represents the inventory value that was sold.\n\n```\nSale20240103004: 1,000.00\nSale20240104005: 1,000.00\nSale20240105007: 1,000.00\nSale20240106009: 100,000.00\nSale20240106010: 100,000.00\nSale20240108014: 1,000.00\nSale20240109016: 5,000.00\nSale20240109017: 20,000.00\nSale20240109018: 5,000.00\nSale20240110019: 20,000.00\nSale20240110020: 20,000.00\nSale20240111022: 20,000.00\nSale20240113025: 100,000.00\nSale20240113026: 20,000.00\nSale20240114028: 1,000.00\nSale20240115029: 1,000.00\nSale20240115030: 1,000.00\nSale20240116032: 100,000.00\nSale20240116033: 100,000.00\nSale20240117035: 100,000.00\nSale20240118037: 20,000.00\nSale20240118038: 100,000.00\nSale20240119040: 20,000.00\nSale20240120042: 100,000.00\nSale20240122045: 5,000.00\nSale20240122046: 1,000.00\nSale20240122047: 100,000.00\nSale20240123048: 20,000.00\nSale20240125050: 100,000.00\nSale20240125051: 100,000.00\nSale20240127055: 20,000.00\nSale20240127056: 100,000.00\nSale20240127057: 5,000.00\nSale20240129060: 5,000.00\nSale20240202063: 20,000.00\nSale20240202064: 100,000.00\nSale20240203065: 20,000.00\nSale20240204068: 5,000.00\nSale20240204069: 20,000.00\nSale20240205070: 5,000.00\nSale20240205071: 100,000.00\nSale20240205072: 1,000.00\n```\n\nTotal cost of goods sold: 1,584,000.00\n\nStep 4: Calculate the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\"\nThis is the difference between cost of goods sold and purchases.\n\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory = Cost of goods sold - Purchases\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory = 1,584,000.00 - 1,684,000.00 = -100,000.00\n\nThe negative number indicates an increase in inventory (more was purchased than sold), which represents a cash outflow in the cash flow statement.\n\nTherefore, the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" item should be -100,000.00.\n\nLet me double-check this calculation.
