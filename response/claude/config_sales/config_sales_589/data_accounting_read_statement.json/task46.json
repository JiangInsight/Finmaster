The negative sign in the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" indicates money flowing out.\n\nThe only component listed is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of $106,218.20. This is shown as a positive number in the statement, which typically means it's a cash outflow (standard accounting practice for this type of statement).\n\nTherefore:\n- The value of net cash flow from investing activities is -$106,218.20\n- The sub-item component is the purchase of fixed assets at $106,218.20\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-106218.20', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '106218.20'}} }\n```",
