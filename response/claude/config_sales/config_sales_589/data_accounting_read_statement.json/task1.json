In accounting, these would typically be combined to represent the total cash position of the company.\n\nTherefore:\n- Initial total cash = 3000000.00 + 5000000.00 = 8000000.00\n- End total cash = 3730866.78 + 3938781.80 = 7669648.58\n\nHowever, based on the example solution provided, it appears I should only consider \"Cash on Hand\" as the cash available for day-to-day operations, not including \"Bank Deposits\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '3000000.00', 'end value': '3730866.78'}}\n```",
