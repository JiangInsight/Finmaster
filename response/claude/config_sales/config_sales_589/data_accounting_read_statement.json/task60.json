The income earned by the entity from financial assets\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\n## Balance Sheet\nFrom the Balance Sheet, I can find \"Bank Deposits\" with an end amount of 3,938,781.80 on 2024-01-28. This represents funds deposited into a bank.\n\n## Income Statement\nFrom the Income Statement, I can find \"Interest Income\" with an amount of 10,811.11 on 2024-01-28. This represents income earned from financial assets.\n\n## Cash Flow Statement\nThe Cash Flow Statement doesn't contain any additional information about bank deposits or interest income that isn't already reflected in the other statements.\n\nTherefore, the two values I need to extract are:\n1. Bank Deposits (end value): 3938781.80\n2. Interest Income: 10811.11\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3938781.80', 'value2': '10811.11'} }\n```",
