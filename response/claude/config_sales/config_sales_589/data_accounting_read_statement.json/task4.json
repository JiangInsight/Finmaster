This is exactly what the task is asking for.\n\nFrom the balance sheet, I can see:\n- Initial amount for Interest Receivable: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- End amount for Interest Receivable: 10811.11 (as of 2024-01-28)\n\nTherefore, the interest accrued but not yet received went from 0.00 to 10811.11 during this period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '10811.11'}}\n```",
