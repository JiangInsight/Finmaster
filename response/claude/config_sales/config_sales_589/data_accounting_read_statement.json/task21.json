This is the amount that comes from the main business operations of the company.\n\nThere's also \"Interest Income\" of 10811.11, but this is financial income rather than revenue from core operations.\n\nTherefore, the value of income arising from the entity's core operating activities is 5695115.02.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5695115.02'}}\n```",
