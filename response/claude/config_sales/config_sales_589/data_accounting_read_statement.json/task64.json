Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares\n\nLet me examine each financial statement:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- The \"Paid-in Capital\" is the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares: 13000000.00\n- The \"Accounts Payable\" shows the amount owed by the entity for goods/services received on credit: 545000.00\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- The \"Profit Before Tax\" shows the profit or loss before deducting tax expense: 1478526.85\n\nSo the three values I need to extract are:\n1. Paid-in Capital: 13000000.00\n2. Profit Before Tax: 1478526.85\n3. Accounts Payable: 545000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1478526.85', 'value3': '545000.00'}}\n```",
