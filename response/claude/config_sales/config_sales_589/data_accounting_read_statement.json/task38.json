This means more money is owed to the entity, not less. \n\nHowever, the task is asking for the decrease in amounts owed, which would be equivalent to finding the line item showing the decrease in accounts receivable. Since the value is negative, it actually represents an increase of $1,562,598.26 in accounts receivable, not a decrease.\n\n## Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1562598.26'}}\n```",
