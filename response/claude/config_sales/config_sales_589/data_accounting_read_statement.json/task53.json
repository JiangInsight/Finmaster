First, I'll check the income statement since it typically shows cost information related to sales.\n\n2. In the income statement, I can see \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with a value of 3,085,000.00. This represents the carrying amount of inventories that were sold during the reporting period.\n\n3. Cost of Goods Sold directly represents the value of inventory that has been sold and recognized as an expense in the income statement.\n\n4.
