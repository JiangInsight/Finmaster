Net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- \"Interest Receivable\" with End_amount of 10811.11 represents interest accrued but not yet received\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- \"Net Increase\" of -330351.42 shows the net change in cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nI can confirm the interest receivable amount in the Income Statement:\n- \"Interest Income\" is also 10811.11, which aligns with the Balance Sheet\n\nAnd I can verify the cash flow amount by checking:\n- Beginning Balance: 8000000.00\n- Ending Balance: 7669648.58\n- Difference: -330351.42\n\nTherefore:\n- value1 (interest accrued but not yet received): 10811.11\n- value2 (net addition in cash and cash equivalents): -330351.42\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '10811.11', 'value2': '-330351.42'} }\n```",
