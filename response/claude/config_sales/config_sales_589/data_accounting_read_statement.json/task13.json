These are typically classified as non-current assets.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, I can see:\n\n1. The balance sheet clearly separates \"Current Assets\" and \"Non-current Assets\"\n2. Non-current assets are those that are not expected to be realized within the normal operating cycle\n3. The line item \"Total Non-current Assets\" shows:\n   - Initial amount: 5000000.00 on 2023-12-31\n   - End amount: 5060468.90 on 2024-01-28\n\nThese non-current assets consist of Fixed Assets (5106218.20) minus Accumulated Depreciation (45749.30) as of the end date.\n\nTherefore, the assets not expected to be realized in the normal operating cycle are represented by \"Total Non-current Assets\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5060468.90'}}\n```",
