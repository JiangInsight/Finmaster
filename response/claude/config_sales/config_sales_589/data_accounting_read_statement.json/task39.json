This represents the change in inventory for the period.\n\nSince the value is negative, it indicates an increase in inventory, not a reduction. However, in cash flow statement terminology, an increase in inventory is shown as a negative number (because it represents cash outflow), while a decrease in inventory would be shown as a positive number.\n\nSo the value for the reduction in the amount of assets held for sale (inventory) is \"-720000.00\". The negative sign represents that inventory increased rather than decreased during this period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-720000.00'}}\n```",
