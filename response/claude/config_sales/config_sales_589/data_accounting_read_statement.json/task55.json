In the balance sheet: \"Taxes Payable\" with an end amount of 284,755.77\n2. In the income statement: \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of 284,755.77\n\nThe task asks for the \"total amount of tax an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period.\" The income statement's \"Tax Expense\" represents the amount of tax related to the current reporting period, which is what we're looking for.\n\nAdditionally, I can confirm this is correct by looking at the cash flow statement, which shows \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" of 284,755.77, indicating this is the tax amount for the current period.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period is 284,755.77.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '284755.77'}}\n```",
