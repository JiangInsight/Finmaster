These are physical items that a company owns and uses in its operations over multiple periods.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet provided:\n- The \"Fixed Assets\" line item shows an initial amount of 5000000.00 as of 2023-12-31\n- The \"Fixed Assets\" line item shows an ending amount of 5106218.20 as of 2024-01-28\n\nThis is the specific line item that represents tangible items held for operational use. The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is a contra-asset account that reduces the value of fixed assets, but the question asks for the specific line items and values of the tangible items themselves.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5106218.20'}}\n```",
