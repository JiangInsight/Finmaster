In the balance sheet, I see \"Accumulated Depreciation\" with an end amount of 45749.30 as of 2024-01-28.\n\n2. In the cash flow statement, there's a line item explicitly labeled \"Depreciation\" with a value of 45749.30.\n\n3. In the income statement, there's also a line item specifically for \"Depreciation\" with the same value of 45749.30.\n\nThe value 45749.30 appears consistently across all three statements for depreciation, which confirms this is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of assets over their useful lives for the reporting period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45749.30'} }\n```",
