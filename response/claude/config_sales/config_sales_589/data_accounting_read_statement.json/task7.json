Looking at the statement, expenses would typically appear as negative values that reduce assets or increase liabilities.\n\nExamining the balance sheet carefully, I notice the \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item. Depreciation is an expense that represents the reduction in value of fixed assets over time.\n\nFrom the balance sheet data:\n- Accumulated Depreciation had an initial value of 0.00 on 2023-12-31\n- Accumulated Depreciation had an end value of 45749.30 on 2024-01-28\n\nThis represents the depreciation expense that has been recognized during this period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '45749.30'}}\n```",
