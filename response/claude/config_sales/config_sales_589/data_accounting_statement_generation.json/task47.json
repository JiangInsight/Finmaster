This involves tracking all cash inflows and outflows from the initial cash balances.\n\nLet me analyze the transactions by their impact on cash:\n\n1) First, I'll identify the initial cash and bank balances:\n   - Initial cash deposit: $3,000,000.00\n   - Initial bank deposit: $5,000,000.00\n   - Total initial balance: $8,000,000.00\n\n2) Now I'll track all cash outflows:\n   - Purchases paid by Cash: $250,000 + $60,000 + $200,000 + $400,000 + $80,000 + $15,000 + $90,000 + $20,000 + $100,000 + $50,000 + $450,000 = $1,715,000\n   - Purchases paid by Bank Transfer: $25,000 + $100,000 + $106,218.20 + $35,000 + $500,000 + $30,000 + $20,000 + $160,000 = $976,218.20\n   - Expenses paid by Cash (summing all expense transactions with \"Paid\" status and \"Cash\" method): $1,258,432.74\n\n3) Cash inflows:\n   - Sales received in Cash (all sales with \"Paid\" status and \"Cash\" method): $4,072,103.95\n\n4) Calculate the ending balance:\n   - Initial balance: $8,000,000.00\n   - Add: Cash inflows: $4,072,103.95\n   - Subtract: Cash outflows: ($1,715,000 + $976,218.20 + $1,258,432.74) = $3,949,650.94\n   - Ending balance: $8,000,000.00 + $4,072,103.95 - $3,949,650.94 = $8,122,453.01\n\n5) Final verification: \n   - Initial Cash: $3,000,000.00\n   - Initial Bank: $5,000,000.00\n   - Cash Sales: $4,072,103.95\n   - Cash Purchases: -$1,715,000.00\n   - Bank Transfer Purchases: -$976,218.20\n   - Cash Expenses: -$1,258,432.74\n   \n   Ending Balance = $3,000,000.00 + $5,000,000.00 + $4,072,103.95 - $1,715,000.00 - $976,218.20 - $1,258,432.74 = $8,122,453.01\n\nTherefore, the final ending cash and cash equivalents balance is $8,122,453.01.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Ending Balance': '8122453.01'}}\n```",
