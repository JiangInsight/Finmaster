I can see:\n- Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45749.3 | 45749.3\n\nDepreciation of 45,749.30 reduces the value of the fixed assets.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the Ending Balance\n\nStarting balance: 5,000,000.00\nAdd: Fixed asset purchases: 106,218.20\nSubtract: Depreciation: 45,749.30\n\nEnding balance = 5,000,000.00 + 106,218.20 - 45,749.30 = 5,060,468.90\n\n## Step 5: Double-check for any other non-current asset transactions\nI don't see any other transactions related to fixed assets, property, plant, equipment, or other non-current assets in the data.\n\nTherefore, the final amount of non-current assets is 5,060,468.90.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '5060468.90'} }\n```",
