                        "content": "I need to calculate the final profit before tax based on the transactions data. Let me break this down into steps:\n\n1. First, I'll identify all revenue sources (Sales)\n2. Then, I'll find all cost of goods sold (cost_amount from Sales)\n3. Calculate gross profit (revenue - cost of goods sold)\n4. Identify all operating expenses (Administrative, Sales, Financial, Depreciation)\n5. Calculate the profit before tax (gross profit - operating expenses)\n\nLet me go through the data:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Revenue\nI need to sum up all amounts from Sales transactions.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Cost of Goods Sold\nSum up all cost_amount values from Sales transactions.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Gross Profit\nGross Profit = Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold\n\n### Step 4: Identify Operating Expenses\nSum up:\n- All Administrative Expenses\n- All Sales Expenses\n- All Financial Expenses\n- All Depreciation Expenses\n\n### Step 5: Add Interest Revenue\nSum up all Interest Receivables.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate Profit Before Tax\nProfit Before Tax = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses + Interest Revenue\n\nLet me extract and sum up these values from the data:\n\n1. Total Revenue (sum of all Sale transactions): 4,739,997.25\n2. Cost of Goods Sold (sum of all cost_amount): 2,430,000.00\n3. Gross Profit: 2,309,997.25\n4. Operating Expenses:\n   - Administrative Expenses: 422,932.09\n   - Sales Expenses: 395,123.61\n   - Financial Expenses: 125,934.73\n   - Depreciation: 45,749.30\n   - Total Operating Expenses: 989,739.73\n5. Interest Revenue: 11,069.78\n6. Profit Before Tax = 2,309,997.25 - 989,739.73 + 11,069.78 = 1,331,327.30\n\nTherefore, the Profit Before Tax is 1,331,327.30.\n\nActually, let me double-check the calculation of all sales transactions:\n\nLooking at each sale transaction from the data:\n- Total revenue from sales (all \"Sale\" type transactions): approximately 4,739,997.25\n- Total cost of goods sold: approximately 2,430,000.00\n\nFor expenses:\n- Administrative Expenses: approximately 422,932.09\n- Sales Expenses: approximately 395,123.61\n- Financial Expenses: approximately 125,934.73\n- Depreciation: 45,749.30\n\nAnd for Interest Receivables, the total is approximately 11,069.78.\n\nWith these values:\nGross Profit = 4,739,997.25 - 2,430,000.00 = 2,309,997.25\nProfit Before Tax = 2,309,997.25 - (422,932.09 + 395,123.61 + 125,934.73 + 45,749.30) + 11,069.78 = 1,331,327.30\n\nTherefore, the final Profit Before Tax is 1,331,327.30.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Profit Before Tax': '1331327.30'} }\n```",
