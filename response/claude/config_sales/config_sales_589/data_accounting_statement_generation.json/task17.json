Retained earnings represent the accumulated net income that has not been distributed to shareholders.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze what affects retained earnings:\n- Increases through Revenue/Sales\n- Decreases through Expenses\n- Not affected by asset purchases, transfers, or initial deposits\n\nLet me work through this methodically:\n\n## Step 1: Identify the initial retained earnings\nSince this appears to be a new business starting on 2023-12-31 with initial deposits, the initial retained earnings should be 0.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate all revenues (sales)\nI'll identify all sales transactions from the data and sum their profit amounts.\n\nLooking through the transactions, I can see all entries with type \"Sale\" include a profit column that shows the net profit for each sale.\n\nTotal sales profit:\n- From all \"Sale\" transactions: Sum of all profit values from these entries\n= 2,306,895.82\n\n## Step 3: Calculate all expenses\nI need to sum all expenses, depreciation, and interest costs.\n\nFrom the data, I identify:\n- Administrative Expenses: 458,079.22\n- Sales Expenses: 384,193.52\n- Financial Expenses: 145,914.37\n- Depreciation: 45,749.30\n- Interest (net): Typically interest receivables would increase earnings, but these appear to be calculated separately\n\nTotal expenses: 1,033,936.41\n\n## Step 4: Calculate retained earnings at end of period\nRetained earnings = Initial retained earnings + Net Income\nNet Income = Revenue - Expenses\n\nRetained Earnings = 0 + (2,306,895.82 - 1,033,936.41)\nRetained Earnings = 1,272,959.41\n\n## Verification\nLet me verify this makes sense:\n- The business started with initial deposits (not affecting retained earnings)\n- Generated substantial sales with healthy profit margins\n- Incurred various expenses\n- The net result is positive retained earnings\n\nThe resulting positive retained earnings aligns with the sales and expense activity I observed in the data.\n\nTherefore, the retained earnings at the end of the period is 1,272,959.41.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Retained Earnings Initial Value': '0.00', 'Retained Earnings End Value': '1272959.41'} }\n```",
