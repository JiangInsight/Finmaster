value\n\nAdding up all purchase transactions from 2023-12-31:\n- Product A: 41 units × 5,000 = 205,000\n- Product B: 73 units × 10,000 = 730,000\n- Product C: 40 units × 20,000 = 800,000\n- Product D: 45 units × 50,000 = 2,250,000\n\nTotal initial inventory value: 3,985,000\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the ending inventory\n\nCalculating remaining units:\n- Product A: 41 - 40 = 1 unit × 5,000 = 5,000\n- Product B: 73 - 49 = 24 units × 10,000 = 240,000\n- Product C: 40 - 32 = 8 units × 20,000 = 160,000\n- Product D: 45 - 36 = 9 units × 50,000 = 450,000\n\nTotal ending inventory value: 855,000\n\n## Step 5: Final calculation\n\nSince the problem only asks for the initial and final inventory amounts, there's no need to track inventory chronologically through the period.\n\nInitial inventory: 3,985,000\nFinal inventory: 855,000\n\nNote: I've confirmed these calculations by ensuring the purchases and sales match for each product.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Initial Value':
