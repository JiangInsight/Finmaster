The cost amount for this transaction was $50000.00, with a tax amount of $4414.68, leading to a total amount due of $83878.86. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- But the recorded data shows:\n  - recorded_amount: 93734.04 (doesn't match invoice's $88293.54)\n  - recorded_unit_price: 99803.38 (doesn't match invoice's $88293.54)\n  - recorded_tax_amount: 74285.82 (vastly different from invoice's $4414.68)\n  - recorded_profit: 38293.54 (seems inconsistent with other numbers)\n\nThis transaction has numerous inconsistencies:\n1. Category mismatch: Invoice says \"Sale\" but recorded as \"Sales Expenses\"\n2. Amount mismatch: Invoice says $88293.54 but recorded as $93734.04\n3. Unit price mismatch: Invoice says $88293.54 but recorded as $99803.38\n4. Tax amount mismatch: Invoice says $4414.68 but recorded as $74285.82\n\nThe after-tax amount in the invoice ($83878.86) is consistent with a sale amount of $88293.54 with tax of $4414.68, reinforcing that these are likely the correct values.\n\nSince we're instructed to trust the invoice information over the recorded fields, I'll use the invoice details as the correct values.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"88293.54\", \"Recorded price\": \"99803.38\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"88293.54\", \"Recorded amount\": \"93734.04\", \"Original tax\": \"4414.68\", \"Recorded tax\": \"74285.82\", \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240106020\"}}\n```",
