The invoice states: \"On January 27, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of **2.0 units** at a unit price of $37236.11, totaling $74472.22. The cost amount for this transaction was $40000.00, with a tax amount of $3723.61, leading to a total amount due of $70748.61. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\n2. However, the recorded data shows:\n   - recorded_quantity: 1.0 (should be 2.0)\n   - recorded_unit_price: $41267.03 (should be $37236.11)\n   - recorded_tax_amount: $70608.21 (should be $3723.61)\n   - recorded_amount: $84686.25 (should be $74472.22)\n\nThe calculation confirms the discrepancy:\n- With 2 units at $37236.11 each: 2 × $37236.11 = $74472.22 (correct total in invoice)\n- With 1 unit at $41267.03: 1 × $41267.03 = $41267.03 (doesn't match the recorded amount)\n\nTherefore, I've identified multiple inconsistencies in the Sale20240127103 transaction.\n\nLet me also check the Sale20240130057 transaction that was identified in the examples, but I don't see it in this dataset.\n\nAfter reviewing all transactions, the Sale20240127103 contains the most significant inconsistencies.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original quantity\": \"2.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Original price\": \"37236.11\", \"Recorded price\": \"41267.03\", \"Original amount\": \"74472.22\", \"Recorded amount\": \"84686.25\", \"Original tax\": \"3723.61\", \"Recorded tax\": \"70608.21\", \"id\": \"Sale20240127103\"}}\n```",
