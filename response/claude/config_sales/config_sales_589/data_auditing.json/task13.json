The cost amount for this transaction was $30000.00, with a tax amount of $2609.77, leading to a total amount due of $49585.70. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\nHowever, the recorded tax amount is $40356.09, which is inconsistent with the invoice description of $2609.77.\n\nChecking the calculations:\n- 3.0 units Ã— $17398.49 = $52195.47 (matches recorded amount)\n- 5% tax on $52195.47 = $2609.77 (matches invoice but not recorded tax)\n- $52195.47 - $2609.77 = $49585.70 (matches the \"total amount due\" in invoice)\n\nSo there are two discrepancies:\n1. The recorded type should be \"Sale\" not \"Depreciation\"\n2. The tax amount should be $2609.77 not $40356.09\n\nTherefore, my solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Depreciation\", \"Original tax\": \"2609.77\", \"Recorded tax\": \"40356.09\", \"id\": \"Sale20240103006\"}}\n```",
