The cost amount for this transaction was $30000.00, with a tax amount of $2609.77, leading to a total amount due of $49585.70. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\nThis reveals discrepancies:\n1. The invoice states the unit price is $17398.49, but the recorded unit price is $15290.15\n2. The invoice states the total amount is $52195.47, but the recorded amount is $61976.73\n\nLet me verify these calculations:\n- Invoice calculation: 3.0 units × $17398.49 = $52195.47 ✓\n- Recorded calculation: 3.0 units × $15290.15 = $45870.45 (which doesn't match the recorded total of $61976.73) ✗\n\nThis confirms there are inconsistencies in this transaction. The invoice information is considered more reliable, so the correct values should be:\n- Unit price: $17398.49\n- Total amount: $52195.47\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '17398.49', 'Recorded price': '15290.15', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '52195.47', 'Recorded amount': '61976.73', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240103006'} }",
