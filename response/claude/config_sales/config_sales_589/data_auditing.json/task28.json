Calculation inconsistencies\n2. Mismatches between recorded values and invoice descriptions\n3. Date discrepancies\n4. Price/amount inconsistencies\n\n## Looking at transaction \"Sale20240107022\":\n\nFrom the invoice: \"On January 07, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $34907.97, totaling $34907.97...\"\n\nBut the recorded information shows:\n- recorded_date: \"2024-01-28\" (invoice says January 07)\n- recorded_unit_price: \"32029.81\" (invoice says $34907.97)\n- recorded_amount: \"39088.05\" (invoice says $34907.97)\n\nThese are clear inconsistencies between the invoice (which is considered more reliable) and the recorded data.\n\nLooking at other fields:\n- The cost amount was $20000.00\n- Tax amount was $1745.40\n- After-tax amount was $33162.57\n\nLet me check if the profit calculation is consistent:\n- Expected profit = total amount - cost amount = $34907.97 - $20000.00 = $14907.97\n- Recorded profit is $14907.97, which matches the expected calculation\n\nHowever, the recorded amount of $39088.05 doesn't align with the unit price times quantity:\n- $32029.81 * 1.0 = $32029.81, which doesn't match the recorded amount of $39088.05\n\nBased on this analysis, there are three main inconsistencies in this transaction:\n1. The recorded date is wrong (January 28 instead of January 07)\n2. The recorded unit price is wrong ($32029.81 instead of $34907.97)\n3. The recorded total amount is wrong ($39088.05 instead of $34907.97)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": \"2024-01-07\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-28\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"34907.97\", \"Recorded price\": \"32029.81\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"34907.97\", \"Recorded amount\": \"39088.05\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240107022\"}}\n```",
