First, I notice transaction `Purchase20231231024` has a missing approver in the recorded data, but the invoice mentions \"the approver is Director\".\n\n2. Similarly, I notice that `Expense20240115001` with \"Administrative Expenses\" for $29391.07 is missing the approver in the recorded data, while the invoice specifies \"the approver is Director\".\n\nLet me verify these discrepancies by comparing the recorded field values with the information provided in the invoice field:\n\nFor `Purchase20231231024`:\n- The invoice states: \"This transaction was prepared by Senior Staff, and the approver is Director.\"\n- But the `recorded_approver` field is empty, while `recorded_preparer` shows \"Senior Staff\"\n\nFor `Expense20240115001` (Administrative Expenses, $29391.07):\n- The invoice states: \"This transaction was prepared by Senior Staff, and the approver is Director.\"\n- But the `recorded_approver` field is empty, while `recorded_preparer` shows \"Senior Staff\"\n\nThese are clear inconsistencies where the recorded data is missing information that is present in the invoice.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': 'Director', 'Recorded Approver': 'None', 'id': 'Purchase20231231024'} }\n```",
