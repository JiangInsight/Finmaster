Since the invoice is considered more reliable, the correct category should be \"Interest Receivables\" and the correct amount should be $376.81.\n\nNo other inconsistencies appear in the data when comparing the recorded information against the invoice details.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Interest Receivables', 'Recorded category': 'Financial Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '376.81', 'Recorded amount': '460.56', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Interest20240110010'} }\n```",
