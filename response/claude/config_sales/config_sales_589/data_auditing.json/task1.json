The invoice details show this is a sale of 2.0 units at a unit price of $91,808.79, with all sales-related data (cost amount, tax amount, etc.), but it was incorrectly categorized as a financial expense.\n\nThe invoice details match all the characteristics of a sale transaction:\n- Unit price: $91,808.79\n- Quantity: 2.0 units\n- Tax amount: $9,180.88\n- Total after tax: $174,436.70\n- Cost amount: $100,000.00\n- Profit: $83,617.58\n\nThis is clearly a sale transaction that was incorrectly categorized as \"Financial Expenses\" in the recorded_type field.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Financial Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240123088'} }\n```",
