Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -224,133.22\n2. Net Profit (Net Income) = 1,193,771.08\n\nThe Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is calculated as:\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = |Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities| รท |Net Income|\n\nTaking the absolute values:\n|Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities| = 224,133.22\n|Net Income| = 1,193,771.08\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n224,133.22 รท 1,193,771.08 = 0.1877515...\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: 0.19\n\nTherefore, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is 0.19.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '0.19'}}\n```",
