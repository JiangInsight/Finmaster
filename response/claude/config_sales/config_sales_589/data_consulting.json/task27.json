Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nThis ratio measures the relationship between operating cash flow and net income.\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -224,133.22\n- Net Profit = 1,193,771.08\n- Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = -224,133.22 รท 1,193,771.08 = -0.19 or -19%\n\n## 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio (also known as Turnover Ratio)\n\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate revenue.\n- Total Revenue = 5,695,115.02\n- Average Current Assets = (9,963,057.95 + 8,000,000.00) รท 2 = 8,981,528.98\n- Current Assets Turnover Ratio = 5,695,115.02 รท 8,981,528.98 = 0.63\n\n## 3. Quick Ratio\n\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n- Quick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 9,963,057.95 - 720,000.00 = 9,243,057.95\n- Total Current Liabilities = 829,755.77\n- Quick Ratio = 9,243,057.95 รท 829,755.77 = 11.14\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.19', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.63', 'Quick Ratio': '11.14'}}\n```",
