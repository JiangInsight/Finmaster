                        "content": "I'll calculate each of these financial ratios step by step based on the provided financial statements.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis measures the company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with the cash generated from operations.\n- Operating Cash Flow = -224,133.22 (from cash flow statement)\n- Current Liabilities = 829,755.77 (from balance sheet)\n- Ratio = -224,133.22 / 829,755.77 = -0.27\n\n## 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures the company's financial leverage.\n- Total Liabilities = 829,755.77 (from balance sheet - Total Current Liabilities)\n- Total Equity = 14,193,771.08 (from balance sheet)\n- Ratio = 829,755.77 / 14,193,771.08 = 0.06\n\n## 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n- Revenue = 5,695,115.02 (from income statement)\n- Total Assets = 15,023,526.85 (from balance sheet)\n- Ratio = 5,695,115.02 / 15,023,526.85 = 0.38\n\n## 4. Quick Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n- Quick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 9,963,057.95 - 720,000.00 = 9,243,057.95\n- Current Liabilities = 829,755.77\n- Ratio = 9,243,057.95 / 829,755.77 = 11.14\n\n## 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis is the same as Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n- Ratio = -0.27\n\n## 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its equity to generate profits.\n- Net Profit = 1,193,771.08 (from income statement)\n- Total Equity = 14,193,771.08 (from balance sheet)\n- ROE = (1,193,771.08 / 14,193,771.08) Ã— 100% = 8.41%\n\n## 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\n- Revenue = 5,695,115.02 (from income statement)\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 1,562,598.26) / 2 = 781,299.13\n- Ratio = 5,695,115.02 / 781,299.13 = 7.29\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.27', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.38', 'Quick Ratio': '11.14', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.27', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '8.41%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.29'} }\n```",
