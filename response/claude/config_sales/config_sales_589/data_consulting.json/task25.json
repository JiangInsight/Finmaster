Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio is calculated as: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $829,755.77\n- Total Owner's Equity = $14,193,771.08\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $829,755.77 / $14,193,771.08 = 0.0584 ≈ 0.06\n\n## 2. Net Profit Margin\n\nThe Net Profit Margin is calculated as: (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = $1,193,771.08\n- Total Revenue = $5,695,115.02\n\nNet Profit Margin = ($1,193,771.08 / $5,695,115.02) × 100% = 20.96%\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis ratio is calculated as: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$224,133.22\n- Total Current Liabilities = $829,755.77\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -$224,133.22 / $829,755.77 = -0.27\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06', 'Net Profit Margin': '20.96%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.27'}}\n```",
