It's typically calculated as:\n\nFCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -224133.22\n- Capital Expenditures (Purchase of Fixed Assets) = 106218.20\n\nTherefore:\nFCF = -224133.22 - 106218.20 = -330351.42\n\nThis matches the \"Net Increase\" value in the Cash and Cash Equivalents section, which confirms our calculation is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-330351.42'} }\n```",
