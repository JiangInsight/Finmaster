Let me work through this step-by-step.\n\n## Step 1: Calculate Net Profit\nFirst, I need to identify all revenue and expense transactions to determine the net profit:\n\n- Total Sales: Sum of all sale transaction amounts = ~4,780,066.10\n- Cost of Goods Sold: Sum of cost_amount from sales = ~2,350,000.00\n- Gross Profit = ~2,430,066.10\n- Expenses:\n  - Administrative Expenses: ~323,986.79\n  - Sales Expenses: ~737,376.97\n  - Financial Expenses: ~242,060.70\n  - Depreciation: 45,749.47\n- Net Profit = ~1,080,892.17\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Operating Activities\n\n### Depreciation\nDepreciation is a non-cash expense that needs to be added back: 45,749.47\n\n### Changes in Working Capital\n- Accounts Receivable: Unpaid sales represent an increase in accounts receivable = ~1,568,124.96\n- Interest Receivable: Sum of interest receivables = 8,201.77\n- Inventory: Purchases represent an increase in inventory = ~2,410,000.00\n- Accounts Payable: Unpaid purchases = ~1,200,000.00\n- Tax Payable: Sum of tax amounts from sales = ~218,953.30\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Cash Flow from Operating Activities\nStarting with Net Profit, adjust for:\n- Add back Depreciation\n- Subtract Increase in Accounts Receivable\n- Subtract Increase in Interest Receivable\n- Subtract Increase in Inventory\n- Add Increase in Accounts Payable\n- Add Increase in Tax Payable\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = ~-1,424,328.25\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Cash Flow from Investing Activities\nCapital expenditures (Purchase of Fixed Assets) = 528,936.17 (Sum of all Fixed Assets Purchases)\n\nNet Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -528,936.17\n\n## Step 5: Determine Cash and Cash Equivalents\n- Beginning Balance: Initial cash (3,000,000.00) + Initial bank deposit (5,000,000.00) = 8,000,000.00\n- Net decrease in cash = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = ~-1,953,264.42\n- Ending Balance = Beginning Balance + Net decrease = ~6,046,735.58\n\nBased on my calculations, here's the complete cash flow statement:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow From Operating Activities': '0.00', 'Net Profit': '1080892.17', 'Depreciation': '45749.47', '(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-1568124.96', '(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-8201.77', '(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-2410000.00', 'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '1200000.00', 'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '218953.30', 'Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities': '-1440731.79', 'Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '0.00', 'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '528936.17', 'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-528936.17', 'Cash and Cash Equivalents': '0.00', 'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00', 'Ending Balance': '6030332.04', 'Net Increase': '-1969667.96'} }\n```",
