Let me work through the different components step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Calculate Main Business Revenue\nFirst, I need to identify all sales transactions and sum their amounts.\n- Looking at all rows with \"type\" as \"Sale\"\n- The total amount of all sales transactions represents the main business revenue\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\nI can find this from the \"cost_amount\" column in the sales transactions.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Gross Profit\nGross Profit = Main Business Revenue - COGS\n\n## Step 4: Identify Operating Expenses\n- Administrative Expenses: Sum of all transactions with \"type\" as \"Administrative Expenses\"\n- Selling Expenses (Sales Expenses): Sum of all transactions with \"type\" as \"Sales Expenses\" \n- Depreciation: Sum of all transactions with \"type\" as \"Depreciation\"\n- Financial Expenses: Sum of all transactions with \"type\" as \"Financial Expenses\"\n\n## Step 5: Calculate Interest Income\nSum of all transactions with \"type\" as \"Interest Receivables\"\n\n## Step 6: Calculate Profit Before Tax\nGross Profit - Total Expenses + Interest Income\n\n## Step 7: Calculate Tax Expense\nThis appears to be the sum of \"tax_amount\" from all sales transactions.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate Net Profit\nProfit Before Tax - Tax Expense\n\nNow, let me perform the actual calculations:\n\n### Main Business Revenue\nAdding up all the \"amount\" values from rows where \"type\" is \"Sale\": $5,074,228.41\n\n### Cost of Goods Sold\nAdding up all the \"cost_amount\" values from Sales rows: $3,665,000.00\n\n### Gross Profit\n$5,074,228.41 - $3,665,000.00 = $1,409,228.41\n\n### Operating Expenses\n- Administrative Expenses: $201,966.79\n- Selling Expenses: $798,135.91\n- Depreciation: $45,749.47\n- Financial Expenses: $204,418.96\n- Total Expenses: $1,250,271.13\n\n### Interest Income\nTotal Interest Receivables: $8,637.71\n\n### Profit Before Tax\n$1,409,228.41 - $1,250,271.13 + $8,637.71 = $167,594.99\n\n### Tax Expense\nSum of tax_amount from all sales: $253,711.42\n\n### Net Profit\n$167,594.99 - $253,711.42 = -$86,116.43\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Main Business Revenue\": \"5074228.41\", \"Total Revenue\": \"5074228.41\", \"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"3665000.00\", \"Total Cost\": \"3665000.00\", \"Gross Profit\": \"1409228.41\", \"Administrative Expenses\": \"201966.79\", \"Selling Expenses\": \"798135.91\", \"Depreciation\": \"45749.47\", \"Financial Expenses\": \"204418.96\", \"Total Expenses\": \"1250271.13\", \"Interest Income\": \"8637.71\", \"Profit Before Tax\": \"167594.99\", \"Tax Expense\": \"253711.42\", \"Net Profit\": \"-86116.43\"}}\n```",
