Let me double-check the problem data for any other fixed asset transactions or if there's something specific I'm missing.\n\nAfter carefully reviewing the data again, I see that I need to only consider the fixed asset purchases in the problem I'm solving (not the example). In the problem data, I see the following fixed asset purchases:\n\n1. `FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 73907.19 | 73907.19 |  |  | Paid |  | Bank Transfer | S009 | Supplier 9 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Production Line4 | Production Line |`\n\n2. `FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 171448.09 | 171448.09 |  |  | Paid |  | Bank Transfer | S005 | Supplier 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Storage Facilities5 | Storage Facilities |`\n\n3. `FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 92277.65 | 92277.65 |  |  | Paid |  | Bank Transfer | S010 | Supplier 10 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Production Line6 | Production Line |`\n\n4. `FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 191303.24 | 191303.24 |  |  | Paid |  | Bank Transfer | S005 | Supplier 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Production Line7 | Production Line |`\n\nThe total purchase of fixed assets is:\n73907.19 + 171448.09 + 92277.65 + 191303.24 = 528936.17\n\nTherefore, the purchase of fixed assets in the cash flow statement is 528936.17.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '528936.17'} }\n```",
