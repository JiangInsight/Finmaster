Looking at the transaction data, I need to identify the initial deposits that represent cash and cash equivalents.\n\n2. From the data, I can see the following initial deposits from December 31, 2023:\n   - Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | 3000000.0\n   - Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0\n\n3. These two transactions represent the beginning cash and cash equivalents:\n   - Cash: 3,000,000.00\n   - Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n   - Total: 8,000,000.00\n\n4. These initial balances were recorded on December 31, 2023, which would be the beginning balance for the cash flow statement starting January 1, 2024.\n\n5. The fixed assets amount of 5,000,000.00 is not included in cash and cash equivalents since it represents non-liquid assets.\n\nTherefore, the beginning cash and cash equivalents balance in the cash flow statement is 8,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
