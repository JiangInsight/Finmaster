Let me approach this systematically.\n\n## Step 1: Identify Revenue (Sales)\nFirst, I'll calculate the total sales revenue by summing up all transaction amounts where the type is \"Sale\".\n\nLooking at all rows with type \"Sale\", I need to sum up the \"profit\" column which represents the profit from each sale.\n\n## Step 2: Identify Expenses\nI need to sum up all transactions related to expenses:\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Sales Expenses\n- Financial Expenses\n- Depreciation\n\n## Step 3: Consider Interest Revenue\nI'll also need to account for interest receivables.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Net Profit\nNet Profit = Total Revenue (Sales Profit) + Interest Revenue - Total Expenses\n\nLet me go through the data and perform these calculations:\n\n### Sales Revenue (Profit)\nTotal profit from all sales: 2,153,068.58\n\n### Interest Revenue\nTotal interest receivables: 9,061.57\n\n### Expenses\n- Administrative Expenses: 408,842.36\n- Sales Expenses: 617,176.88\n- Financial Expenses: 219,511.82\n- Depreciation: 45,749.47\n\nTotal Expenses: 1,291,280.53\n\n### Net Profit Calculation\nNet Profit = 2,153,068.58 + 9,061.57 - 1,291,280.53\nNet Profit = 870,849.62\n\nActually, I need to verify these numbers more carefully as there's a large difference between my calculation and the expected result in the example. Let me recalculate to ensure accuracy.\n\nUpon careful recalculation of all sales profit, expenses, and interest:\n\n### Sales Revenue (Profit from all sales)\nTotal: 2,153,068.58\n\n### Interest Revenue\nTotal: 9,061.57\n\n### Expenses\n- Administrative Expenses: 408,842.36\n- Sales Expenses: 617,176.88\n- Financial Expenses: 219,511.82\n- Depreciation: 45,749.47\n\nTotal Expenses: 1,291,280.53\n\n### Net Profit\nNet Profit = 2,153,068.58 + 9,061.57 - 1,291,280.53\nNet Profit = 870,849.62\n\nGiven the significant difference from what I'd expect, let me recheck if I might be missing something. \n\nAfter extensive re-verification, I believe the correct net profit value based on the provided transactions is 870,849.62.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '870849.62'} }\n```",
