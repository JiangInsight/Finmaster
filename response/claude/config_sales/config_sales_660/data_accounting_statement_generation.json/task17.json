This suggests the initial value is zero as this appears to be a new business.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate revenues (sales transactions)\nLet me extract all the sales transactions and calculate total revenue:\n\nAll sales transactions are between Jan 2, 2024 and Jan 29, 2024.\n- Total sales amount: 4,217,702.01 (sum of all sale transactions)\n- Total cost of goods sold: 2,570,000.00 (sum of cost_amount column for all sales)\n- Gross profit from sales: 1,647,702.01\n\n## Step 4: Calculate expenses\nExpenses include:\n- Administrative expenses: 310,169.79\n- Sales expenses: 577,203.19\n- Financial expenses: 246,003.87\n- Depreciation: 45,749.47\nTotal expenses: 1,179,126.32\n\n## Step 5: Interest receivables\nTotal interest receivables: 8,359.71 (this is income)\n\n## Step 6: Calculate net income\nNet income = Gross profit + Interest receivables - Total expenses\nNet income = 1,647,702.01 + 8,359.71 - 1,179,126.32 = 476,935.40\n\n## Step 7: Determine retained earnings\nInitial retained earnings = 0.00\nFinal retained earnings = Initial retained earnings + Net income = 0 + 476,935.40 = 476,935.40\n\nTherefore:\n- Retained Earnings Initial Value: 0.00\n- Retained Earnings End Value: 476,935.40\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Retained Earnings Initial Value': '0.00', 'Retained Earnings End Value': '476935.40'}}\n```",
