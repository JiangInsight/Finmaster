Let me work through this step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Understand what accumulated depreciation is\nAccumulated depreciation is the total amount of depreciation expense that has been recorded for an asset since its acquisition. It's a contra-asset account that reduces the value of the fixed assets on the balance sheet.\n\n## Step 2: Find the initial accumulated depreciation value\nAt the beginning, I need to check if there's any existing accumulated depreciation at the initial point (December 31, 2023). Looking through the initial transactions, I don't see any entries indicating existing accumulated depreciation, so the initial value would be 0.00.\n\n## Step 3: Identify depreciation transactions\nI need to find all the depreciation entries in the data. Searching for \"Depreciation\" transactions:\n\n```\n| Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45749.47 | 45749.47 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n```\n\nI found one depreciation entry on January 1, 2024, with an amount of 45,749.47.\n\n## Step 4: Check for any other entries that might affect accumulated depreciation\nLooking through the rest of the transactions, I don't see any other entries that would directly affect accumulated depreciation, such as depreciation reversals or adjustments.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the final accumulated depreciation\nThe initial value was 0.00, and we added 45,749.47 in depreciation, so the end value is 45,749.47.\n\nBased on my analysis, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accumulated Depreciation End Value': '45749.47'} }\n```",
