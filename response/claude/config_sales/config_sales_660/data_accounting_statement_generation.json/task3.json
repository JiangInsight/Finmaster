                        "content": "I'll solve this step by step to calculate the inventory values based on the transactions data.\n\n## Step 1: Identify Purchase and Sale Transactions\nI need to identify all purchase and sale transactions to track inventory movements.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Initial Inventory Value\nLooking at the data, I don't see any initial inventory declared in the balance sheet. The initial value appears to be zero.\n\n## Step 3: Track Inventory Movements\nLet me track all purchases and sales to calculate the ending inventory value.\n\n### Purchases:\n- Purchase20231231001: Premium Product C, 7 units × 20,000 = 140,000\n- Purchase20231231002: Premium Product A, 4 units × 5,000 = 20,000\n- Purchase20231231003: Premium Product A, 8 units × 5,000 = 40,000\n- Purchase20231231004: Premium Product B, 5 units × 10,000 = 50,000\n- Purchase20231231005: Premium Product D, 6 units × 50,000 = 300,000\n- Purchase20231231006: Premium Product C, 10 units × 20,000 = 200,000\n- Purchase20231231007: Premium Product C, 5 units × 20,000 = 100,000\n- Purchase20231231008: Premium Product B, 9 units × 10,000 = 90,000\n- Purchase20231231009: Premium Product D, 9 units × 50,000 = 450,000\n- Purchase20231231010: Premium Product B, 6 units × 10,000 = 60,000\n- Purchase20231231011: Premium Product C, 10 units × 20,000 = 200,000\n- Purchase20231231012: Premium Product B, 6 units × 10,000 = 60,000\n- Purchase20231231013: Premium Product A, 7 units × 5,000 = 35,000\n- Purchase20231231014: Premium Product C, 3 units × 20,000 = 60,000\n- Purchase20231231015: Premium Product A, 7 units × 5,000 = 35,000\n- Purchase20231231016: Premium Product D, 8 units × 50,000 = 400,000\n- Purchase20231231017: Premium Product B, 7 units × 10,000 = 70,000\n- Purchase20231231018: Premium Product A, 8 units × 5,000 = 40,000\n- Purchase20231231019: Premium Product B, 9 units × 10,000 = 90,000\n- Purchase20231231020: Premium Product D, 6 units × 50,000 = 300,000\n- Purchase20231231021: Premium Product A, 3 units × 5,000 = 15,000\n- Purchase20231231022: Premium Product C, 8 units × 20,000 = 160,000\n- Purchase20231231023: Premium Product A, 9 units × 5,000 = 45,000\n- Purchase20231231024: Premium Product A, 3 units × 5,000 = 15,000\n- Purchase20231231025: Premium Product C, 8 units × 20,000 = 160,000\n- Purchase20231231026: Premium Product B, 5 units × 10,000 = 50,000\n\nTotal Purchases = 3,185,000\n\n### Sales (counting units sold):\nCalculating total units sold for each product:\n\nPremium Product A:\n- Total units sold: 1+2+3+2+2+3+2+3+2+2+2+2+2+3+2+2 = 35 units\n\nPremium Product B:\n- Total units sold: 2+3+3+1+2+3+3+1+3+3+2+2+3+2+2+2+3 = 40 units\n\nPremium Product C:\n- Total units sold: 3+2+1+1+1+2+1+2+1+1+1+3+1+2+1+3+1+2+2+2+2+3 = 36 units\n\nPremium Product D:\n- Total units sold: 2+3+1+2+2+2+2+3+3+2+1+2+3+2 = 30 units\n\n### Inventory Calculation:\nPremium Product A:\n- Purchased: 4+8+7+7+8+3+9+3+7 = 56 units\n- Sold: 35 units\n- Remaining: 21 units × 5,000 = 105,000\n\nPremium Product B:\n- Purchased: 5+9+6+6+7+9+5 = 47 units\n- Sold: 40 units\n- Remaining: 7 units × 10,000 = 70,000\n\nPremium Product C:\n- Purchased: 7+10+5+10+3+8+8 = 51 units\n- Sold: 36 units\n- Remaining: 15 units × 20,000 = 300,000\n\nPremium Product D:\n- Purchased: 6+9+8+6 = 29 units\n- Sold: 30 units\n- Remaining: -1 unit (possible data error or we need to assume they received more inventory not recorded)\n- Setting to 0 units, value = 0\n\nSince we have a negative inventory for Premium Product D, there might be a data issue. However, for the calculation, I'll proceed with the assumption that all purchases were recorded.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Ending Inventory\nTotal Ending Inventory = 105,000 + 70,000 + 300,000 + 0 = 475,000\n\n## Step 5: Double Check\nLet me verify if there's anything missing in the original calculation:\n\nActually, I need to verify again with a different approach. Let's count the total units purchased and sold by product:\n\nPremium Product A: \n- Purchased: 49 units (recounted to be sure)\n- Sold: 35 units\n- Remaining: 14 units × 5,000 = 70,000\n\nPremium Product B:\n- Purchased: 47 units\n- Sold: 40 units\n- Remaining: 7 units × 10,000 = 70,000\n\nPremium Product C:\n- Purchased: 51 units\n- Sold: 36 units\n- Remaining: 15 units × 20,000 = 300,000\n\nPremium Product D:\n- Purchased: 29 units\n- Sold: 30 units\n- To resolve this discrepancy, I'll assume there was an unrecorded purchase or return\n- Setting to 0 value\n\nTotal Ending Inventory = 70,000 + 70,000 + 300,000 + 0 = 440,000\n\n## Final Answer:\nThere's an issue with my count. Let me verify one more time:\n\nFor Premium Product A:\n- Purchased: 4+8+7+7+8+3+9+3+7 = 56 units\n- Sold: 35 units\n- Remaining: 21 units × 5,000 = 105,000\n\nFor Premium Product B:\n- Purchased: 5+9+6+6+7+9+5 = 47 units\n- Sold: 40 units\n- Remaining: 7 units × 10,000 = 70,000\n\nFor Premium Product C:\n- Purchased: 7+10+5+10+3+8+8 = 51 units\n- Sold: 36 units\n- Remaining: 15 units × 20,000 = 300,000\n\nFor Premium Product D:\n- Purchased: 6+9+8+6 = 29 units\n- Sold: 30 units\n- Remaining: -1 unit × 50,000 = -50,000 (indicating a data issue)\n- Setting to 0 value\n\nTotal Ending Inventory = 105,000 + 70,000 + 300,000 + 0 = 475,000\n\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Initial Value': '0.00', 'Inventory End Value': '475000.00'}}",
