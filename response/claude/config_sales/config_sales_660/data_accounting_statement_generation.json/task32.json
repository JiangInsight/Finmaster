To do this, I'll analyze the revenue, cost of goods sold, and expenses.\n\n## Step 1: Identify all sales transactions\nFirst, I'll identify all the sale transactions to calculate the total revenue.\n\nLooking at the data, all sales have type \"Sale\" and contain profit information.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate total revenue (profit from sales)\nI need to sum up all the \"profit\" values from sale transactions.\n\nGoing through all sale transactions (with type \"Sale\"):\n- Total profits from sales = Sum of all profit values from sale transactions\n\n## Step 3: Identify and sum all expenses\nThe expenses include:\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Sales Expenses\n- Financial Expenses\n- Depreciation\n\nI need to sum up all expenses by their type.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate interest income\nThe interest income comes from transactions with type \"Interest Receivables\".\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the final profit before tax\nProfit Before Tax = Total Sales Profits - Total Expenses + Total Interest Income\n\nLet me go through the transactions and calculate the values:\n\n1. Total sales profits (summing all profit values from sale transactions): 2,056,353.57\n2. Total Administrative Expenses: 287,439.23\n3. Total Sales Expenses: 545,551.50\n4. Total Financial Expenses: 190,057.31\n5. Total Depreciation: 45,749.47\n6. Total Interest Income: 8,260.12\n\nNow I can calculate the Profit Before Tax:\nProfit Before Tax = 2,056,353.57 - (287,439.23 + 545,551.50 + 190,057.31 + 45,749.47) + 8,260.12\nProfit Before Tax = 2,056,353.57 - 1,068,797.51 + 8,260.12\nProfit Before Tax = 995,816.18\n\nTherefore, the final profit before tax is $995,816.18.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Profit Before Tax': '995816.18'} }\n```",
