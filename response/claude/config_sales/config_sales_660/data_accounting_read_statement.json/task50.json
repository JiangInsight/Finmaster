Systematic allocation of depreciable amount (i.e., depreciation)\n2. Reduction in amount of assets held for sale (i.e., inventory change)\n3. Net cash from acquisition/disposal of long-term assets (i.e., net cash flow from investing activities)\n4. Net addition in cash and cash equivalents (i.e., net increase)\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement:\n\n1. Depreciation = 45749.47\n2. (Increase) Decrease in Inventory = -450000.00 (negative because it's an increase)\n3. Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -528936.17\n4. Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents = -593035.27\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '45749.47', 'value2': '-450000.00', 'value3': '-528936.17', 'value4': '-593035.27'}}\n```",
