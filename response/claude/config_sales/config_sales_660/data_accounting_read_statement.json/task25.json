This makes sense as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" represents the direct production costs, while \"Selling Expenses\" represents the costs associated with selling and delivering products to customers.\n\nTherefore, the value I need to extract is 855800.20.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '855800.20'}}\n```",
