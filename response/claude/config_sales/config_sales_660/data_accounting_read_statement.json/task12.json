These are typically classified as current assets.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, I can see the following line items:\n- \"Total Current Assets\" represents assets expected to be realized within the operating cycle\n- The initial value of Total Current Assets is 8,000,000.00 as of 2023-12-31\n- The end value of Total Current Assets is 9,717,259.46 as of 2024-01-29\n\nCurrent assets typically include cash, bank deposits, receivables, inventory, and other short-term assets that will be converted to cash or used up within one operating cycle. The balance sheet clearly labels these as \"Total Current Assets\", which is exactly what I'm looking for.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '9717259.46'}}\n```",
