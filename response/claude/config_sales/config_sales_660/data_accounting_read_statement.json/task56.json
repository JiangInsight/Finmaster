In the balance sheet, I see \"Accumulated Depreciation\" with an end amount of 45749.47 as of 2024-01-29.\n\n2. In the cash flow statement, I see \"Depreciation\" with an amount of 45749.47.\n\n3. In the income statement, I see \"Depreciation\" listed as an expense with the amount of 45749.47.\n\nThe line item \"Depreciation\" appears in both the income statement and cash flow statement with the same value of 45749.47. This represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of assets over their useful lives for the period.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45749.47'} }\n```",
