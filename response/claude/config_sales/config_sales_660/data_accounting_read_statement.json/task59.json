The net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nLet me analyze the financial statements:\n\nFor the first item, I need to find interest accrued but not yet received. In the balance sheet, there's a line item called \"Interest Receivable\" with an end amount of 8967.44. This represents interest that has been earned but not yet received.\n\nFor the second item, I need to find the net addition in cash and cash equivalents. In the cash flow statement, there's a line item called \"Net Increase\" with an amount of -593035.27. This represents the net change in cash and cash equivalents during the period. The negative sign indicates a decrease rather than an increase.\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '8967.44', 'value2': '-593035.27'}}\n```",
