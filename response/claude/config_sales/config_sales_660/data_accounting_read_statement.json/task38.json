When there's an increase in accounts receivable, it means more money is owed to the company (but not yet received), which appears as a negative number in the cash flow statement.\n\nIn this case, the negative value of -1851327.29 indicates an increase in accounts receivable, meaning more customers owe money to the company compared to the previous period. Since I need to report the decrease in amounts owed (which is the opposite of what we have here), I need to report this value.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1851327.29'}}\n```",
