Based on the income statement structure, these components would be:\n\n1. Total Revenue: 5064939.23\n2. Total Cost: 2735000.00\n3. Total Expenses: 1378460.51\n4. Interest Income: 8967.44\n\nThe profit before tax calculation would be:\nTotal Revenue - Total Cost - Total Expenses + Interest Income\n= 5064939.23 - 2735000.00 - 1378460.51 + 8967.44\n= 960446.16\n\nThis matches the \"Profit Before Tax\" amount shown in the statement, confirming these are the correct components.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '960446.16', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '5064939.23', 'sub_item value2': '2735000.00', 'sub_item value3': '1378460.51', 'sub_item value4': '8967.44'}}}\n```",
