In a balance sheet, accumulated depreciation represents the total depreciation expense that has been recorded over time.\n\nFrom the data provided:\n- Accumulated Depreciation has an initial value of 0.00 as of 2023-12-31\n- Accumulated Depreciation has an end value of 45749.47 as of 2024-01-29\n\nThis indicates that depreciation expense was recorded during this period, and the accumulated depreciation increased from 0 to 45749.47.\n\nTherefore, the expense line item I need to extract is Accumulated Depreciation, with:\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- End value: 45749.47\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '45749.47'}}\n```",
