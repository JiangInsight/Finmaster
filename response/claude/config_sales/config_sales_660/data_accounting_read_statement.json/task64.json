Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares\n\nLet me examine each financial statement:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- \"Paid-in Capital\" represents capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares: 13000000.00\n- \"Accounts Payable\" represents amounts owed for goods/services purchased on credit: 1240000.00\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- \"Profit Before Tax\" represents profit before deducting tax expense: 960446.16\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- I can see the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is 1240000.00, confirming the addition in accounts payable\n\nTherefore:\n- value1 = Paid-in Capital = 13000000.00\n- value2 = Profit Before Tax = 960446.16\n- value3 = Accounts Payable = 1240000.00\n\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '960446.16', 'value3': '1240000.00'}}",
