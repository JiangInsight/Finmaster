The account that represents interest accrued but not yet received would be \"Interest Receivable\" since this account typically tracks interest that has been earned but not yet collected.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Interest Receivable initial amount (2023-12-31): 0.00\n- Interest Receivable end amount (2024-01-29): 8967.44\n\nTherefore, the interest accrued but not yet received had an initial value of 0.00 and an end value of 8967.44.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '8967.44'}}\n```",
