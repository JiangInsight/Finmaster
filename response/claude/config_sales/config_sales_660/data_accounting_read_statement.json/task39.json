However, the task is asking for a reduction, which would be a positive value. In this statement, there isn't a positive value for inventory change, meaning there wasn't a reduction in inventory during this period.\n\nSince the inventory changed by -450000.00, this represents the amount of increase in inventory (or in other words, this is the negative of a reduction). This is the value that answers the question.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-450000.00'}}\n```",
