The only constituent line item that makes up this total revenue is \"Main Business Revenue\" with the same value of 5064939.23\n\nThis is similar to the example where Total Revenue equals Main Business Revenue, indicating this is the only component of revenue.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5064939.23', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '5064939.23'}} }\n```",
