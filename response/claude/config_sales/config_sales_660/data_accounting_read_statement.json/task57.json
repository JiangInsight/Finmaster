First, I need to identify the account that represents amounts owed for goods or services received on credit. This would typically be \"Accounts Payable\".\n\n2. From the balance sheet, I can see that:\n   - Accounts Payable had an initial amount of $0.00 on 2023-12-31\n   - Accounts Payable had an end amount of $1,240,000.00 on 2024-01-29\n\n3. From the cash flow statement, I can verify this by looking at the line \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\", which shows $1,240,000.00.\n\n4. This represents the net increase in Accounts Payable during the period, which is the amount added to what the entity owes for goods or services received on credit.\n\nThe specific line item is \"Accounts Payable\" with a value of $1,240,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1240000.00'} }\n```",
