However, based on the example provided, the solution only included the \"Cash on Hand\" value, which suggests that's the specific line item I should extract.\n\nInitial value for \"Cash on Hand\": 3000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\nEnd value for \"Cash on Hand\": 4540900.90 (as of 2024-01-29)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '3000000.00', 'end value': '4540900.90'}}\n```",
