This represents interest that has been earned but not yet received, which is exactly what I'm looking for.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial amount for \"Interest Receivable\" is 0.00 on 2023-12-31\n- End amount for \"Interest Receivable\" is 8967.44 on 2024-01-29\n\nI can confirm this by looking at the cash flow statement, which shows \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" as -8967.44, indicating an increase in Interest Receivable by this amount.\n\nAdditionally, the income statement shows \"Interest Income\" of 8967.44, which corresponds to the interest accrued during this period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '8967.44'}}\n```",
