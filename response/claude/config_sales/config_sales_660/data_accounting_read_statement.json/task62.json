Financing costs incurred for production and operation\n3. Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement systematically:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- \"Accounts Receivable\" represents amounts owed to the entity for goods/services sold on credit: $1,851,327.29\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- \"Financial Expenses\" represents financing costs incurred: $226,258.90\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" represents cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment: $528,936.17\n\nTherefore, the three values are:\n1. Accounts Receivable: $1,851,327.29\n2. Financial Expenses: $226,258.90\n3. Purchase of Fixed Assets: $528,936.17\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1851327.29', 'value2': '226258.90', 'value3': '528936.17'}}\n```",
