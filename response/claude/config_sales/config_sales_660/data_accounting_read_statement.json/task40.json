When accounts payable increases, it means the company has acquired more goods or services on credit.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement provided:\n- The line \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" shows a value of 1240000.00\n- This positive value indicates an increase in accounts payable, meaning the company added $1,240,000.00 to what it owes suppliers for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\nTherefore, the value that represents the addition in the amount owed for goods or services received on credit is 1240000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1240000.00'}}\n```",
