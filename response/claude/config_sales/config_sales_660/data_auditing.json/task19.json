The recorded_type should be \"Sale\" not \"Sales Expenses\"\n2. The recorded_date should be \"2024-01-12\" not \"2024-01-23\"\n\nThese inconsistencies suggest data entry errors, as the transaction details and invoice description clearly indicate this is a sale transaction from January 12.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original date': '2024-01-12', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-23', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240112039'} }\n```",
