The invoice field is considered more reliable due to its standardized and regulated nature.\n\nLet me examine the data for inconsistencies:\n\n## Looking at Sale20240114047\n\nThis transaction catches my attention because its recorded_type is \"Administrative Expenses\" but the ID and invoice suggest it's a sale:\n\n1. **Transaction ID**: \"Sale20240114047\" - The ID begins with \"Sale\" suggesting this should be a sale transaction\n2. **Recorded Type**: \"Administrative Expenses\" - This doesn't match the ID prefix\n3. **Invoice**: \"On January 14, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $35029.94, totaling $70059.88. The cost amount for this transaction was $40000.00, with a tax amount of $3502.99, leading to a total amount due of $66556.89. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\nLooking at the inconsistencies:\n- The invoice clearly states this is a Sale transaction, but it's recorded as \"Administrative Expenses\"\n- The invoice states total amount is $70059.88, but recorded_amount is $84715.15\n- The invoice states unit price is $35029.94, but recorded_unit_price is $38521.80\n- The invoice states tax amount is $3502.99, but recorded_tax_amount is $56334.15\n\nThe differences are significant, especially in the tax amount. This appears to be a sale transaction that was incorrectly categorized and had several numerical errors.\n\nBased on the invoice information, which is considered more reliable, the correct values should be:\n- Category: Sale\n- Amount: $70059.88\n- Unit Price: $35029.94\n- Tax Amount: $3502.99\n\nI didn't find other transactions with such clear inconsistencies.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Administrative Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '35029.94', 'Recorded price': '38521.80', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '70059.88', 'Recorded amount': '84715.15', 'Original tax': '3502.99', 'Recorded tax': '56334.15', 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240114047'} }\n```",
