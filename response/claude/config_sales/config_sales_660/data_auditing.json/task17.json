First inconsistency found in entry \"Interest20240116016\":\n   - The ID suggests this is an Interest Receivables transaction\n   - However, it's recorded as \"Sales Expenses\" instead of \"Interest Receivables\"\n   - The recorded receive_method is \"Cash\" but the invoice indicates it should be \"Interest receviable\"\n   - The invoice text confirms this is an Interest Receivables transaction\n\n2. Second inconsistency found in entry \"Sale20240124094\":\n   - The ID indicates this is a Sale transaction\n   - However, it's recorded as \"Purchase\" instead of \"Sale\"\n   - The recorded receive_method is \"Interest receivable\" but based on the invoice and pattern, it should be \"Account Receviable\"\n   - The invoice text clearly states this was a Sale transaction\n\nBased on the analysis, I've identified two transactions with inconsistencies between their recorded information and what's stated in the invoice.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": [\n  {\n    \"id\": \"Interest20240116016\",\n    \"Original category\": \"Interest Receivables\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": \"Interest receviable\",\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240124094\",\n    \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Purchase\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Interest receivable\"\n  }\n]}\n```",
