Calculation errors: amounts that don't add up based on quantity Ã— price\n2. Profit calculation errors: amount - cost_amount should equal profit\n3. Inconsistencies between recorded fields and invoice information\n4. Tax calculation errors: tax should be consistent with reported amounts\n\nLooking at the data systematically:\n\n## Sale20240123088\nLet's check this transaction closely:\n- Recorded amount: $19,898.44\n- Cost amount: $10,000.00\n- Recorded profit: $12,354.24\n\nThere's an inconsistency in profit calculation. The profit should be (total amount - cost amount):\n$19,898.44 - $10,000.00 = $9,898.44\n\nHowever, the recorded profit is shown as $12,354.24, which is $2,455.80 more than expected.\n\nThe invoice confirms that the unit price is $9,949.22 for 2 units, totaling $19,898.44 with a cost of $10,000.00, so the correct profit should be $9,898.44.\n\n## Sale20240114023\nLooking at this transaction:\n- Recorded amount: $317,862.15\n- Cost amount: $250,000.00\n- Recorded profit: $48,671.48\n\nThe profit calculation is incorrect. The profit should be:\n$317,862.15 - $250,000.00 = $67,862.15\n\nHowever, the recorded profit is shown as $48,671.48, which is $19,190.67 less than the correct amount.\n\nThe correct profit should be $67,862.15 based on the transaction details.\n\nAfter reviewing all transactions in the dataset, I've identified these two clear inconsistencies in profit calculations.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': '9898.44', 'Recorded profit': '12354.24', 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240123088'} }",
