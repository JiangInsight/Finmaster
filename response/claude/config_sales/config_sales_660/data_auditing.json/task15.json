Wrong transaction type (recorded as \"Depreciation\" but should be \"Sale\")\n2. Wrong quantity (recorded as 2 units but should be 3 units)\n\nThe invoice details provide the correct information, stating it's a sale of 3 units at $37895.43 per unit, totaling $113686.29.\n\nI don't see any other significant inconsistencies in the other transactions that need to be highlighted.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Depreciation', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '3.0', 'Recorded quantity': '2.0', 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '113686.29', 'Recorded amount': '75790.86', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240115052'} }\n```",
