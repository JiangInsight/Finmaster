Date discrepancy: Recorded as Jan 13, but invoice says Jan 05\n2. Amount discrepancy: Recorded as $27,287.96, but invoice says $25,773.47\n\n## Purchase20231231001\nLooking at the purchase transaction:\n- The recorded amount is $140,000.00\n- The invoice describes \"7.0 units at a unit price of $20000.00, totaling $140000.00\"\n- This is consistent (7 Ã— $20,000 = $140,000)\n\n## Interest20240114014\nWhile the invoice text shows \"On January 14, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Interest Receivables, totaling $323.48\", there's no explicit inconsistency indication in the data for this transaction.\n\nGiven the evidence found, I'll provide the solution focusing on the clearly inconsistent Expense20240105001 transaction:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-05', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-13', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '25773.47', 'Recorded amount': '27287.96', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240105001'} }\n```",
