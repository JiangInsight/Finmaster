Since invoice details are generally more reliable as they represent official documents that have undergone verification, the correct status should be \"Paid\" rather than \"Unpaid\".\n\n## Second inconsistency: Purchase20231231001\nThe recorded amount and the calculation based on unit price and quantity don't match:\n- Recorded amount: 140000.0\n- Calculated amount (7.0 units Ã— 20000.0): 140000.0\nThis is consistent, no error here.\n\nAfter reviewing all transactions in the data, I found only one clear inconsistency in the \"Sale20240108028\" transaction where the payment status recorded doesn't match what's indicated in the invoice description.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240108028'} }\n```",
