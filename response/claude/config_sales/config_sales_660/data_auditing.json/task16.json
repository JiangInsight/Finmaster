The recorded amount is $24,180.35\n2. The invoice text states \"totaling $21,907.90\"\n3. The recorded payment/receipt_status is \"Unpaid\"\n4. The invoice text states \"this transaction was paid\"\n\nThis shows two discrepancies:\n- Amount discrepancy: $24,180.35 vs $21,907.90\n- Payment status discrepancy: \"Unpaid\" vs \"paid\"\n\nSince the invoice text is considered more reliable, the correct values should be $21,907.90 for the amount and \"Paid\" for the payment status.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '21907.90', 'Recorded amount': '24180.35', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240129001'} }\n```",
