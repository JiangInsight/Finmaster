                        "content": "I'll solve this task by calculating the requested financial ratios step by step.\n\n## 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\nFormula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nSince we don't have specific credit sales information, I'll use total revenue.\nAverage Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2 = (0 + 1,851,327.29) / 2 = 925,663.65\nNet Credit Sales = Total Revenue = 5,064,939.23\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 5,064,939.23 / 925,663.65 = 5.47\n\n## 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay off short-term liabilities with operating cash flow.\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nOperating Cash Flow = -64,099.10\nCurrent Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -64,099.10 / 1,493,246.99 = -0.04\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis is essentially the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio calculated above.\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -64,099.10 / 1,493,246.99 = -0.04\n\n## 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\nFormula: Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nNet Sales = Total Revenue = 5,064,939.23\nAverage Total Assets = (Beginning Assets + Ending Assets) / 2 = (13,000,000 + 15,200,446.16) / 2 = 14,100,223.08\n\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = 5,064,939.23 / 14,100,223.08 = 0.36\n\n## 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nThis ratio measures a company's financial leverage.\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nTotal Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\nTotal Shareholders' Equity = 13,707,199.17\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 1,493,246.99 / 13,707,199.17 = 0.11\n\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '5.47', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-0.04', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.04', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.36', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11'}}",
