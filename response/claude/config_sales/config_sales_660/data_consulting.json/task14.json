Net Credit Sales: This is typically the revenue from the income statement. From the income statement, I can see:\n   - Main Business Revenue: 5,064,939.23\n\n2. Average Accounts Receivable: I need to calculate the average of beginning and ending accounts receivable.\n   - Beginning Accounts Receivable (Initial): 0.00\n   - Ending Accounts Receivable: 1,851,327.29\n   - Average Accounts Receivable = (0.00 + 1,851,327.29) รท 2 = 925,663.65\n\nNow I can calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 5,064,939.23 รท 925,663.65 = 5.47\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: 5.47\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"5.47\"}}\n```",
