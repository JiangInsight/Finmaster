Debt to Asset Ratio\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated as Total Liabilities / Total Assets.\n\n- Total Liabilities = $1,493,246.99 (from balance sheet)\n- Total Assets = $15,200,446.16 (from balance sheet)\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $1,493,246.99 / $15,200,446.16 = 0.0982 ≈ 0.10\n\n## 2. Gross Profit Margin\nThe Gross Profit Margin is calculated as Gross Profit / Total Revenue × 100%.\n\n- Gross Profit = $2,329,939.23 (from income statement)\n- Total Revenue = $5,064,939.23 (from income statement)\n\nGross Profit Margin = $2,329,939.23 / $5,064,939.23 × 100% = 46.00%\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThe Operating Cash Flow Ratio is calculated as Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities.\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$64,099.10 (from cash flow statement)\n- Current Liabilities = $1,493,246.99 (from balance sheet)\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$64,099.10 / $1,493,246.99 = -0.0429 ≈ -0.04\n\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Gross Profit Margin': '46.00%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.04'}}",
