Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -64,099.10 (from the cash flow statement)\n2. Total Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99 (from the balance sheet ending amount)\n\nThe Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio is calculated by dividing the Operating Cash Flow by the Current Liabilities:\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -64,099.10 / 1,493,246.99\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -0.0429\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: -0.04\n\nThis negative ratio indicates that the company's operations aren't generating enough cash to cover its current liabilities.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.04'} }\n```",
