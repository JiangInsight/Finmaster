                        "content": "I need to calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio for this problem. This ratio shows the company's ability to repay its debt using operating cash flow.\n\nThe formula for Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nLet me extract the relevant information:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow: From the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is -$64,099.10\n\n2. Total Debt: From the balance sheet, Total Liabilities is $1,493,246.99 (which equals Total Current Liabilities since there are no long-term liabilities)\n\nNow, I'll calculate the ratio:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -$64,099.10 / $1,493,246.99 = -0.04292\n\nConverting to a more readable format with 2 decimal places:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -0.04 (or -4% if expressed as a percentage)\n\nThis negative ratio indicates that the company is not generating sufficient operating cash flows to cover its debt obligations.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.04'} }\n```",
