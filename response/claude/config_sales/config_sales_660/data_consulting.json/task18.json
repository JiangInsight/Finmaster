From the cash flow statement, I can see:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -64,099.10\n\n2. From the balance sheet, I can see:\n   - Total Current Liabilities: 1,493,246.99\n\nThe Operating Cash Flow Ratio is calculated as:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nCalculation:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -64,099.10 / 1,493,246.99 = -0.04292\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: -0.04\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.04'} }\n```",
