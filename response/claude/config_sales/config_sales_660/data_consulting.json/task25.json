Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures a company's financial leverage by comparing total liabilities to total shareholders' equity.\n\nFormula: Total Liabilities ÷ Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = $1,493,246.99\n- Total Owner's Equity = $13,707,199.17\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $1,493,246.99 ÷ $13,707,199.17 = 0.109 ≈ 0.11\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\nThis shows the percentage of revenue that is converted into net profit.\n\nFormula: Net Profit ÷ Total Revenue × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = $707,199.17\n- Total Revenue = $5,064,939.23\n\nNet Profit Margin = ($707,199.17 ÷ $5,064,939.23) × 100% = 13.96%\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to cover its current liabilities from its operating cash flow.\n\nFormula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities ÷ Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the financial statements:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$64,099.10\n- Total Current Liabilities = $1,493,246.99\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -$64,099.10 ÷ $1,493,246.99 = -0.043 ≈ -0.04\n\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Net Profit Margin': '13.96%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.04'}}",
