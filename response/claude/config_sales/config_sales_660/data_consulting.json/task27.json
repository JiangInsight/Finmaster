                        "content": "I need to calculate three financial ratios based on the given statements. Let me approach this step by step.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\nThis ratio shows the relationship between operating cash flow and net income.\n\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -64,099.10\n- Net Profit = 707,199.17\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = -64,099.10 / 707,199.17 = -0.091 â‰ˆ -0.09\n\n## 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio (also called Turnover Ratio)\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate revenue.\n\nFormula: Current Assets Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Current Assets\n\n- Total Revenue = 5,064,939.23\n- Initial Current Assets = 8,000,000.00\n- End Current Assets = 9,717,259.46\n- Average Current Assets = (8,000,000.00 + 9,717,259.46) / 2 = 8,858,629.73\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = 5,064,939.23 / 8,858,629.73 = 0.57\n\n## 3. Quick Ratio\nThe quick ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n\nFormula: Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\n- Current Assets = 9,717,259.46\n- Inventory = 450,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n\nQuick Ratio = (9,717,259.46 - 450,000.00) / 1,493,246.99 = 9,267,259.46 / 1,493,246.99 = 6.21\n\nTherefore, my final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.09', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.57', 'Quick Ratio': '6.21'} }\n```",
