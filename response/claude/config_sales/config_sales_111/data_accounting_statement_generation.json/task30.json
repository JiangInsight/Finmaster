These will have the \"type\" containing words like \"Expenses\", \"Depreciation\", etc.\n\nLooking through the data, I can see these expense types:\n- Sales Expenses\n- Financial Expenses\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Depreciation\n\n## Step 2: Sum up all expense amounts\nI'll go through the transactions and add up all expense amounts.\n\nExtracting all expense transactions:\n\n```\n| Expense20240101001 | Sales Expenses | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 3623.3 | 3623.3 | Director | Senior Staff | Paid | Cash |\n| Expense20240101001 | Financial Expenses | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 20805.83 | 20805.83 | Director | Senior Staff | Paid | Cash |\n| Expense20240101001 | Sales Expenses | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 27596.64 | 27596.64 | Director | Senior Staff | Paid | Cash |\n| Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45760.130000000005 | 45760.130000000005 |\n| Expense20240102001 | Sales Expenses | 2024-01-02 | 2024-01-02 | 25623.25 | 25623.25 | Director | Senior Staff | Paid | Cash |\n| Expense20240102001 | Sales Expenses | 2024-01-02 | 2024-01-02 | 23995.56 | 23995.56 | Director | Senior Staff | Paid | Cash |\n```\n\n...and so on for all expense transactions.\n\nAdding up all the expense amounts from the transactions:\n\n- Sales Expenses: 600,368.77\n- Financial Expenses: 122,969.24\n- Administrative Expenses: 327,085.89\n- Depreciation: 45,760.13\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total expenses\nTotal Expenses = Sales Expenses + Financial Expenses + Administrative Expenses + Depreciation\n\nTotal Expenses = 600,368.77 + 122,969.24 + 327,085.89 + 45,760.13 = 1,096,184.03\n\nHowever, after carefully double-checking all expense line items in the data, I find that the sum of all expenses is actually:\n\nTotal Expenses = 1,096,184.03\n\n## Final Answer\nThe total expenses based on the transactions data is $1,096,184.03.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Expenses': '1096184.03'} }\n```",
