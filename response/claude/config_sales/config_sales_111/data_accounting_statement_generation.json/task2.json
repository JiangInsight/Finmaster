I'll analyze all transactions that affect bank deposits.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the initial bank deposit value\nLooking at the data, I can see an initial bank deposit entry:\n```\n| Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n```\nThis shows the initial bank deposit was 5,000,000.00.\n\n## Step 2: Identify all transactions affecting bank deposits\nI need to find:\n- Purchases paid through \"Bank Transfer\"\n- Fixed asset purchases paid through \"Bank Transfer\"\n- Cash to bank transfers\n- Any other transactions affecting bank balance\n\n### Bank Transfers Out (Purchases and Fixed Assets):\n1. Purchase20231231001: 40,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n2. Purchase20231231007: 70,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n3. Purchase20231231010: 40,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n4. Purchase20231231020: 250,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n5. Purchase20231231021: 500,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n6. Purchase20231231023: 40,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n7. Purchase20231231024: 160,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n8. FixedAsset20231231001: 321,724.42 (Bank Transfer)\n9.
