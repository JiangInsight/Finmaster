This requires tracking all cash flows in and out of the company.\n\nLet me start with the initial cash and bank deposit balances, then track all cash inflows and outflows.\n\n### Initial balances:\n- Cash deposit: $3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: $5,000,000.00\n- Total initial balance: $8,000,000.00\n\n### Cash inflows:\n1.

bank:\nThese are internal transfers that don't affect the total, so I don't need to include them in the calculation of total ending balance.\n\nNow let me calculate the final balance:\n\nInitial Balance: $8,000,000.00\n- Total Cash Purchases: -$1,250,000.00\n- Total Bank Transfer Purchases: -$1,060,000.00\n- Total Fixed Asset Purchases: -$437,464.43\n- Total Expenses Paid in Cash: -$1,330,452.02\n+ Total Cash Sales: +$3,980,566.92\n\nFinal Balance = $8,000,000.00 - $1,250,000.00 - $1,060,000.00 - $437,464.43 - $1,330,452.02 + $3,980,566.92\nFinal Balance = $7,902,650.47\n\nLet me verify this by double-checking the major categories:\n\nInitial: $8,000,000.00\nNet outflow from purchases: -$2,310,000.00\nNet outflow from fixed assets: -$437,464.43\nNet outflow from expenses: -$1,330,452.02\nNet inflow from sales: +$3,980,566.92\n\nFinal: $8,000,000.00 - $2,310,000.00 - $437,464.43 - $1,330,452.02 + $3,980,566.92 = $7,902,650.47\n\nHowever, I'm getting a different total than expected. Let me recalculate more carefully.\n\nThe initial balances were:\n- Cash: $3,000,000.00\n- Bank: $5,000,000.00\n- Total: $8,000,000.00\n\nLet me focus only on transactions that affect the cash and bank balances:\n\n1. Cash payments: -$1,250,000.00 (purchases) - $1,330,452.02 (expenses) = -$2,580,452.02\n2. Bank payments: -$1,060,000.00 (purchases) - $437,464.43 (fixed assets) = -$1,497,464.43\n3. Cash receipts (sales): +$3,980,566.92\n\nNet cash change: -$2,580,452.02 + $3,980,566.92 = +$1,400,114.90\nNet bank change: -$1,497,464.43\n\nFinal cash: $3,000,000.00 + $1,400,114.90 = $4,400,114.90\nFinal bank: $5,000,000.00 - $1,497,464.43 = $3,502,535.57\n\nTotal ending balance: $4,400,114.90 + $3,502,535.57 = $7,902,650.47\n\nThis matches my previous calculation. However, I notice that in this problem there are also \"Cash to bank transfer\" transactions that I need to account for. These transfers move money from cash to bank without changing the total.\n\nLet me adjust the cash and bank balances for these transfers:\n\n- Total cash to bank transfers: $0 (no values specified in transfers)\n\nThe final cash and bank balances after accounting for transfers would be:\nFinal cash: $4,400,114.90 \nFinal bank: $3,502,535.57\nTotal: $7,902,650.47\n\nLooking at the data again, I see that there are specific transfer transactions that I need to account for. Let me ensure I'm handling these properly.\n\nI notice that each \"Cash to bank transfer\" transaction reduces cash and increases bank by the amount specified. Let me total these transfers:\n\nThere are no specific amounts mentioned for the transfers in the given data. \n\nThe final ending cash and cash equivalents balance is:\n$7,902,650.47\n\nOn second check, I see that there are multiple \"Cash to bank transfer\" transactions with an amount of $100,000.00 each. Let me count and total these:\n\n- There appear to be 22 transfer transactions of $100,000 each\n- Total transfers: 22 × $100,000 = $2,200,000\n\nThese transfers reduce cash and increase bank:\n- Final cash: $4,400,114.90 - $2,200,000 = $2,200,114.90\n- Final bank: $3,502,535.57 + $2,200,000 = $5,702,535.57\n- Total: $7,902,650.47 (unchanged)\n\nTherefore, the final ending cash and cash equivalents balance is $7,902,650.47.\n\nActually, looking again, there are exactly ",
