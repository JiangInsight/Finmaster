These would typically be identified by transactions at the beginning of the period marked as \"Initial\" deposits.\n\nIn the data, I can see:\n\n1. Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 3000000.0 | 3000000.0\n2. Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0\n\nThese are the opening balances for cash and bank deposits as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe beginning cash and cash equivalents balance would be the sum of these two amounts:\n- Cash deposit: $3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: $5,000,000.00\n- Total beginning balance: $8,000,000.00\n\nThis represents the total cash and cash equivalents available at the beginning of the reporting period, which would be the beginning balance in the cash flow statement.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
