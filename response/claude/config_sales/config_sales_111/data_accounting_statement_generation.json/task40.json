                        "content": "I need to calculate the final inventory item in the cash flow statement, which represents the change in inventory for the period. This is typically reported as \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" in the cash flow statement.\n\nTo calculate this, I need to:\n1. Find all inventory purchases during the period\n2. Find the cost of inventory sold (cost of goods sold)\n3. Calculate the change in inventory = Purchases - Cost of goods sold\n\n## Step 1: Find all inventory purchases\nLet me identify all the purchase transactions for inventory:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: Premium Product A - 40,000.00\n- Purchase20231231002: Premium Product C - 60,000.00\n- Purchase20231231003: Premium Product B - 60,000.00\n- Purchase20231231004: Premium Product C - 100,000.00\n- Purchase20231231005: Premium Product A - 45,000.00\n- Purchase20231231006: Premium Product D - 500,000.00\n- Purchase20231231007: Premium Product B - 70,000.00\n- Purchase20231231008: Premium Product A - 20,000.00\n- Purchase20231231009: Premium Product C - 160,000.00\n- Purchase20231231010: Premium Product D - 250,000.00\n- Purchase20231231011: Premium Product A - 30,000.00\n- Purchase20231231012: Premium Product C - 140,000.00\n- Purchase20231231013: Premium Product D - 350,000.00\n- Purchase20231231014: Premium Product B - 30,000.00\n- Purchase20231231015: Premium Product C - 180,000.00\n- Purchase20231231016: Premium Product B - 70,000.00\n- Purchase20231231017: Premium Product C - 120,000.00\n- Purchase20231231018: Premium Product D - 150,000.00\n- Purchase20231231019: Premium Product C - 200,000.00\n- Purchase20231231020: Premium Product D - 250,000.00\n- Purchase20231231021: Premium Product D - 500,000.00\n- Purchase20231231022: Premium Product A - 45,000.00\n- Purchase20231231023: Premium Product A - 40,000.00\n- Purchase20231231024: Premium Product C - 160,000.00\n\nTotal Purchases = 3,570,000.00\n\n## Step 2: Find the cost of goods sold\nLooking at all the sales transactions, I need to sum the cost_amount column to find the total cost of goods sold.\n\nLet me count all the cost_amount entries from sales transactions:\n\nTotal Cost of Goods Sold = 2,110,000.00\n\nThis includes:\n- Product A: 180,000.00\n- Product B: 130,000.00\n- Product C: 500,000.00\n- Product D: 1,300,000.00\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the change in inventory\nChange in inventory = Purchases - Cost of goods sold\nChange in inventory = 3,570,000.00 - 2,110,000.00 = 1,460,000.00\n\nSince this represents an increase in inventory, in the cash flow statement it would be reported as a negative number (cash outflow). The final inventory item would be \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with a value of -1,460,000.00.\n\nActually, let me double-check my calculations. I need to go through each product type and verify:\n\nFor Product A:\n- Purchases: 40,000 + 45,000 + 20,000 + 30,000 + 45,000 + 40,000 = 220,000\n- COGS: 180,000\n- Remaining: 40,000\n\nFor Product B:\n- Purchases: 60,000 + 70,000 + 30,000 + 70,000 = 230,000\n- COGS: 130,000\n- Remaining: 100,000\n\nFor Product C:\n- Purchases: 60,000 + 100,000 + 160,000 + 140,000 + 180,000 + 120,000 + 200,000 + 160,000 = 1,120,000\n- COGS: 500,000\n- Remaining: 620,000\n\nFor Product D:\n- Purchases: 500,000 + 250,000 + 350,000 + 150,000 + 250,000 + 500,000 = 2,000,000\n- COGS: 1,300,000\n- Remaining: 700,000\n\nTotal increase in inventory = 40,000 + 100,000 + 620,000 + 700,000 = 1,460,000\n\nIn the cash flow statement, this would appear as \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with a value of \"-1,460,000.00\".\n\nHowever, I need to be careful with the sign convention. In standard cash flow statements, an increase in inventory is considered a use of cash and is shown as a negative number. Since the question asks for the \"final inventory item in the cash flow statement,\" I'll format it according to standard cash flow statement presentation.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-1460000.00'} }\n```",
