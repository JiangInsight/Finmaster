                        "content": "I need to calculate the property, plant and non-current assets values for the balance sheet, showing both initial and final amounts.\n\nLet me examine the data step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll identify the initial non-current assets value as of 2023-12-31.\n2. Then I'll track all additions or disposals of fixed assets.\n3. I'll account for depreciation during the period.\n4. Finally, I'll calculate the ending balance.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the initial non-current assets value\nFrom the data, I can see that on 2023-12-31, there was an entry:\n```\nInitial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0\n```\nThis indicates the initial value of fixed assets was 5,000,000.00.\n\n## Step 2: Identify any fixed asset purchases or disposals\nI need to look for entries with type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\":\n\n1. On 2023-12-31, there was a fixed asset purchase:\n```\nFixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 321724.42 | 321724.42 | | | Paid | Bank Transfer | | S002 | Supplier 2 | | | | | | | | | | | Processing Equipment4 | Processing Equipment\n```\n\n2. Also on 2023-12-31, there was another fixed asset purchase:\n```\nFixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 115740.01 | 115740.01 | | | Paid | Bank Transfer | | S002 | Supplier 2 | | | | | | | | | | | Production Line5 | Production Line \n```\n\nSo there were two additional fixed asset purchases totaling 321,724.42 + 115,740.01 = 437,464.43.\n\n## Step 3: Account for depreciation\nI found one depreciation entry:\n```\nDepreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45760.130000000005 | 45760.130000000005\n```\nThis indicates that depreciation expense of 45,760.13 was recorded.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the ending value\nInitial value: 5,000,000.00\n+ Asset additions: 437,464.43\n- Depreciation: 45,760.13\n= Ending value: 5,391,704.30\n\nHowever, I need to double-check this calculation, as there might be other transactions affecting fixed assets that I need to account for. Since this is the only depreciation expense recorded during the period, and I don't see any asset disposals, this should be accurate.\n\nActually, let me verify once more if there were any other fixed asset transactions that I may have missed. Looking through the data, I only identified the two fixed asset purchases and the one depreciation entry. No other transactions appear to affect non-current assets.\n\nTherefore:\n- Initial value: 5,000,000.00\n- Final value: 5,000,000.00 + 437,464.43 - 45,760.13 = 5,391,704.30\n\nLet's make sure I've rounded correctly:\n5,000,000.00 + 437,464.43 - 45,760.13 = 5,391,704.30\n\nThe total non-current assets values are:\n- Initial value: 5,000,000.00\n- End value: 5,391,704.30\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '5391704.30'} }\n```",
