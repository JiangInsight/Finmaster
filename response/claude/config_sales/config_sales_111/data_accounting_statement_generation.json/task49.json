                        "content": "I'll solve this step by step to generate a complete cash flow statement based on the transaction data.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze all the transactions to calculate each component of the cash flow statement.\n\n## Step 1: Calculate Net Profit\nTo calculate net profit, I need to identify all revenue (sales) and expenses.\n\n### Sales Revenue:\nAll sales transactions total: 5,013,063.78\n\n### Cost of Goods Sold:\nCost amount from sales transactions: 2,950,000.00\n\n### Expenses:\n- Sales Expenses: 772,879.14\n- Administrative Expenses: 443,089.81\n- Financial Expenses: 123,086.48\n- Depreciation: 45,760.13\n\n### Net Profit Calculation:\nRevenue - COGS - Expenses = 5,013,063.78 - 2,950,000.00 - (772,879.14 + 443,089.81 + 123,086.48 + 45,760.13) = 678,248.22\n\n## Step 2: Calculate changes in working capital\n\n### Accounts Receivable:\n- Initial: 0\n- Sales on account: 1,620,957.96\n- AR at end: 1,620,957.96\n- Increase in AR: 1,620,957.96\n\n### Interest Receivable:\n- Initial: 0\n- Interest accrued: 11,009.46\n- Increase in IR: 11,009.46\n\n### Inventory:\n- Initial: 0\n- Purchases: 3,460,000.00\n- COGS: 2,950,000.00\n- Increase in inventory: 510,000.00\n\n### Accounts Payable:\n- Initial: 0\n- Purchases on account: 1,200,000.00\n- AP at end: 1,200,000.00\n- Increase in AP: 1,200,000.00\n\n### Tax Payable:\n- Initial: 0\n- Tax on sales: 250,653.19\n- Tax payable at end: 250,653.19\n- Increase in tax payable: 250,653.19\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\nNet Profit + Depreciation + Changes in Working Capital\n\n678,248.22 + 45,760.13 + (-1,620,957.96) + (-11,009.46) + (-510,000.00) + 1,200,000.00 + 250,653.19 = 32,694.12\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Cash Flow from Investing Activities\nFixed asset purchases: 437,464.43\n\n## Step 5: Calculate Cash Flow from Financing Activities\nThere are no financing activities in the data.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents\nNet Cash from Operating + Net Cash from Investing = 32,694.12 - 437,464.43 = -404,770.31\n\n## Step 7: Calculate Ending Cash Balance\nBeginning cash (from initial deposits): 8,000,000.00\nNet increase in cash: -404,770.31\nEnding cash: 8,000,000.00 - 404,770.31 = 7,595,229.69\n\nNow I'll format the results in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow From Operating Activities': '0.00', 'Net Profit': '678,248.22', 'Depreciation': '45,760.13', '(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-1,620,957.96', '(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-11,009.46', '(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-510,000.00', 'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '1,200,000.00', 'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '250,653.19', 'Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities': '32,694.12', 'Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '0.00', 'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '437,464.43', 'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-437,464.43', 'Cash and Cash Equivalents': '0.00', 'Beginning Balance': '8,000,000.00', 'Ending Balance': '7,595,229.69', 'Net Increase': '-404,770.31'} }\n```\n\nLet me double-check my calculations for accuracy:\n\nThe cash balance is affected by:\n1. Cash sales: 3,392,105.82\n2. Cash expenses: -1,339,055.43\n3. Cash purchases: -2,020,356.27\n4. Fixed asset purchases: -437,464.43\n\nThis gives a net change of: -404,770.31, which matches my calculated net increase.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow From Operating Activities': '0.00', 'Net Profit': '678248.22', 'Depreciation': '45760.13', '(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-1620957.96', '(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-11009.46', '(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-510000.00', 'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '1200000.00', 'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '250653.19', 'Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities': '32694.12', 'Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '0.00', 'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '437464.43', 'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-437464.43', 'Cash and Cash Equivalents': '0.00', 'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00', 'Ending Balance': '7595229.69', 'Net Increase': '-404770.31'} }",
