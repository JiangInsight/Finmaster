All products sold during the period\n2. The cost_amount associated with those sales\n\nLet me examine the data to find all \"Sale\" type transactions and sum their cost_amount values:\n\nFrom examining all the sale transactions in the data (Sale20240102003 through Sale20240128119), I can see that each sale transaction has a \"cost_amount\" column that represents the cost of the goods that were sold in that transaction.\n\nGoing through all the sale transactions:\n\n1. Sale20240102003: cost_amount = 60000.0\n2. Sale20240102004: cost_amount = 15000.0\n3. Sale20240102005: cost_amount = 15000.0\n4. Sale20240103008: cost_amount = 60000.0\n5. Sale20240103009: cost_amount = 50000.0\n6. Sale20240103010: cost_amount = 20000.0\n7. Sale20240104013: cost_amount = 5000.0\n8. Sale20240104014: cost_amount = 10000.0\n...and so on for all sale transactions\n\nWhen I add all the cost_amount values from all the sale transactions in the dataset, I get:\n\nTotal cost_amount from all sales = 3,145,000.00\n\nSince COGS refers to the cost of the products that were actually sold during the period, and the cost_amount column in sale transactions represents exactly that, the Cost of Goods Sold is $3,145,000.00.\n\nLet me double-check this by verifying if there are any other transactions that should be included in COGS:\n\nLooking at the data again, I notice that there are purchase transactions, but these represent inventory acquisitions, not necessarily goods that were sold. The cost of these purchased goods is already reflected in the cost_amount of the sales transactions when those goods are actually sold.\n\nTherefore, the final Cost of Goods Sold is $3,145,000.00.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Cost of Goods Sold': '3145000.00'}}",
