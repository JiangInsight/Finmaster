Since the question is asking for the final accounts receivable item in the cash flow statement, we need to note that:\n\n1. In cash flow statements, an increase in accounts receivable is shown as a negative value (because it represents cash that should have been received but wasn't)\n2. The format in the cash flow statement would be \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\"\n\nSince there was an increase in accounts receivable of 1,454,443.80, the value in the cash flow statement would be negative: -1,454,443.80.\n\nHowever, I need to verify if there were any opening balances for accounts receivable at the start of the period. Looking at the data, I don't see any indication of opening accounts receivable balances. Therefore, the entire amount represents the increase during the period.\n\nActually, looking more closely, I need to check if there were any interest receivables as well, as these would also be part of accounts receivable.\n\nI see multiple interest receivable entries:\n- Interest20240101001: 441.44 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240102002: 441.44 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240103003: 441.44 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240104004: 435.21 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240105005: 435.21 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240106006: 435.21 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240107007: 435.21 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240108008: 435.21 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240109009: 435.21 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240110010: 435.21 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240111011: 435.21 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240112012: 435.21 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240113013: 435.21 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240114014: 435.21 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240115015: 435.21 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240116016: 435.21 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240117017: 435.21 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240118018: 406.58 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240119019: 406.58 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240120020: 384.33 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240121021: 384.33 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240122022: 339.83 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240123023: 339.83 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240124024: 339.83 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240125025: 339.83 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240126026: 339.83 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240127027: 336.27 (Unpaid)\n- Interest20240128028: 311.73 (Unpaid)\n\nAdding up all interest receivables:\n10,435.39\n\nSo the total increase in accounts receivable (sales + interest) is:\n1,454,443.80 + 10,435.39 = 1,464,879.19\n\nFor the cash flow statement, this represents a negative value since it's an increase in receivables (cash outflow effect):\n-1,464,879.19\n\nTherefore, the final accounts receivable item in the cash flow statement is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-1464879.19'} }\n```",
