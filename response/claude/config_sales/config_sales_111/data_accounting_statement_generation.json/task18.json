                        "content": "I'll calculate the total owner's equity at the beginning and end of the period based on the transactions data.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the initial owner's equity\nLooking at the transactions marked as \"Initial\" in the data, I can see:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00\n\nThese represent the initial capital contributions to the business, so the total initial owner's equity is the sum of these values: 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 13,000,000.00\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the end-of-period owner's equity\nTo find the ending owner's equity, I need to take the initial equity and add the net income (or subtract the net loss) for the period.\n\n### Calculate Revenue\n- Sum of all sales amounts:\n  Total from all sale transactions (Sale2024*) = 4,865,431.23\n\n### Calculate Expenses\n- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):\n  The cost_amount from all sale transactions = 2,500,000.00\n  \n- Operating Expenses:\n  - Administrative Expenses: 470,304.82\n  - Sales Expenses: 587,777.36\n  - Financial Expenses: 166,723.68\n  - Depreciation: 45,760.13\n  \n  Total Operating Expenses = 1,270,566.00\n\n### Calculate Net Income\nNet Income = Revenue - COGS - Operating Expenses\nNet Income = 4,865,431.23 - 2,500,000.00 - 1,270,566.00 = 1,094,865.23\n\n### Calculate Interest Revenue\nTotal interest receivables = 10,993.34\n\n### Final Owner's Equity Calculation\nEnding Owner's Equity = Initial Owner's Equity + Net Income + Interest Revenue\nEnding Owner's Equity = 13,000,000.00 + 1,094,865.23 + 10,993.34 = 14,105,858.57\n\nHowever, I need to subtract any owner withdrawals or add any additional owner investments made during the period. Looking at the data, there's significant capital expenditure on purchases and fixed assets (merchandise inventory and capital assets) that needs to be considered.\n\nIn this case, since we have the initial equity and are tracking all the business transactions including revenues and expenses, the ending owner's equity would be 14,105,858.57, but I should validate if there were any direct withdrawals from equity.\n\nLooking closer at the data, there's a large difference in asset purchases that needs to be accounted for. After recalculating all transactions affecting equity, including initial inventory purchases of 2,750,000.00, I get an ending equity of:\n\nEnding Owner's Equity = 13,000,000.00 + 1,094,865.23 + 10,993.34 - 2,750,000.00 = 11,354,858.57\n\nTherefore, the ending owner's equity is 11,354,858.57.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Owners Equity Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Total Owners Equity End Value': '11354858.57'}}\n```",
