                        "content": "I need to calculate the inventory item in the balance sheet by analyzing purchase and sale transactions.\n\n## Step 1: Understand what I need to calculate\nI need to determine:\n1. The initial inventory value as of 2023-12-31\n2. The final inventory value as of the end of the transactions (2024-01-28)\n\n## Step 2: Identify relevant transactions\nThe relevant transactions are:\n- Purchases: These add to inventory\n- Sales: These reduce inventory (based on the cost_per_unit)\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the initial inventory value\nI'll identify all purchase transactions that occurred on 2023-12-31, as these establish the initial inventory.\n\nFor 2023-12-31:\n- Purchase20231231001: Premium Product A, 8 units × $5,000 = $40,000\n- Purchase20231231002: Premium Product C, 3 units × $20,000 = $60,000\n- Purchase20231231003: Premium Product B, 6 units × $10,000 = $60,000\n- Purchase20231231004: Premium Product C, 5 units × $20,000 = $100,000\n- Purchase20231231005: Premium Product A, 9 units × $5,000 = $45,000\n- Purchase20231231006: Premium Product D, 10 units × $50,000 = $500,000\n- Purchase20231231007: Premium Product B, 7 units × $10,000 = $70,000\n- Purchase20231231008: Premium Product A, 4 units × $5,000 = $20,000\n- Purchase20231231009: Premium Product C, 8 units × $20,000 = $160,000\n- Purchase20231231010: Premium Product D, 5 units × $50,000 = $250,000\n- Purchase20231231011: Premium Product A, 6 units × $5,000 = $30,000\n- Purchase20231231012: Premium Product C, 7 units × $20,000 = $140,000\n- Purchase20231231013: Premium Product D, 7 units × $50,000 = $350,000\n- Purchase20231231014: Premium Product B, 3 units × $10,000 = $30,000\n- Purchase20231231015: Premium Product C, 9 units × $20,000 = $180,000\n- Purchase20231231016: Premium Product B, 7 units × $10,000 = $70,000\n- Purchase20231231017: Premium Product C, 6 units × $20,000 = $120,000\n- Purchase20231231018: Premium Product D, 3 units × $50,000 = $150,000\n- Purchase20231231019: Premium Product C, 10 units × $20,000 = $200,000\n- Purchase20231231020: Premium Product D, 5 units × $50,000 = $250,000\n- Purchase20231231021: Premium Product D, 10 units × $50,000 = $500,000\n- Purchase20231231022: Premium Product A, 9 units × $5,000 = $45,000\n- Purchase20231231023: Premium Product A, 8 units × $5,000 = $40,000\n- Purchase20231231024: Premium Product C, 8 units × $20,000 = $160,000\n\nTotal initial inventory value:\n- Premium Product A: 44 units, $220,000\n- Premium Product B: 23 units, $230,000\n- Premium Product C: 56 units, $1,120,000\n- Premium Product D: 40 units, $2,000,000\n\nTotal initial inventory: $3,570,000\n\n## Step 4: Track inventory changes from sales\nNow I need to track how much inventory was consumed through sales. I'll go through the sales transactions to calculate the cost of goods sold:\n\nSales data shows:\n- Premium Product A: 36 units sold × $5,000 = $180,000\n- Premium Product B: 16 units sold × $10,000 = $160,000\n- Premium Product C: 36 units sold × $20,000 = $720,000\n- Premium Product D: 20 units sold × $50,000 = $1,000,000\n\nTotal cost of goods sold: $2,060,000\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the ending inventory\nEnding inventory = Initial inventory - Cost of goods sold\n\n- Premium Product A: 44 - 36 = 8 units, $40,000\n- Premium Product B: 23 - 16 = 7 units, $70,000\n- Premium Product C: 56 - 36 = 20 units, $400,000\n- Premium Product D: 40 - 20 = 20 units, $1,000,000\n\nTotal ending inventory: $1,510,000\n\n## Step 6: Double-check my calculation\nLet me verify with a different approach:\n- Initial inventory: $3,570,000\n- Cost of goods sold: $2,060,000\n- Ending inventory should be: $1,510,000\n\nThat matches my calculation above.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Initial Value': '3570000.00', 'Inventory End Value': '1510000.00'} }\n```",
