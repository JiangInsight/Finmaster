Let me verify the list again...\n\nUpon closer inspection, I realize that some of the transactions might be outside the relevant time period or might be duplicates. Let me focus only on transactions in January 2024 for this specific problem:\n\nAdding up all the Sales Expenses transactions from January 2024, I get a total of $766,631.88.\n\nLet me try a different approach. I'll use the type column to identify all \"Sales Expenses\" entries and then sum them up. From the data, I can see these are entries where the type is \"Sales Expenses\".\n\nThe total amount for all Sales Expenses transactions is $766,631.88.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Selling Expenses': '766631.88'} }",
