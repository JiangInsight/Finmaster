Purchases paid in cash or bank transfer:\n   - Purchase20231231001: $40,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n   - Purchase20231231006: $500,000.00 (Cash)\n   - Purchase20231231007: $70,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n   - Purchase20231231011: $30,000.00 (Cash)\n   - Purchase20231231013: $350,000.00 (Cash)\n   - Purchase20231231015: $180,000.00 (Cash)\n   - Purchase20231231016: $70,000.00 (Cash)\n   - Purchase20231231017: $120,000.00 (Cash)\n   - Purchase20231231020: $250,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n   - Purchase20231231021: $500,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n   - Purchase20231231023: $40,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n   - Purchase20231231024: $160,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n\n2. Fixed asset purchases:\n   - FixedAsset20231231001 (Processing Equipment): $321,724.42 (Bank Transfer)\n   - FixedAsset20231231001 (Production Line): $115,740.01 (Bank Transfer)\n\n3. Expenses paid in cash:\n   - Sales Expenses: $652,248.38 (Sum of all sales expenses paid in cash)\n   - Administrative Expenses: $312,582.06 (Sum of all administrative expenses paid in cash)\n   - Financial Expenses: $97,175.45 (Sum of all financial expenses paid in cash)\n\n#### Cash inflows:\nSales paid in cash:\n   - Total cash sales: $2,820,071.79 (Sum of all sales with \"Cash\" payment method)\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the net change in cash\n\nStarting cash and cash equivalents: $8,000,000.00\n\nCash outflows:\n- Purchases paid in cash/bank transfer: $2,310,000.00\n- Fixed asset purchases: $437,464.43\n- Expenses: $1,062,005.89\n\nCash inflows:\n- Sales in cash: $2,820,071.79\n\nNet change = Starting balance + Inflows - Outflows\nNet change = $8,000,000.00 + $2,820,071.79 - ($2,310,000.00 + $437,464.43 + $1,062,005.89)\nNet change = $8,000,000.00 + $2,820,071.79 - $3,809,470.32\nNet change = $7,010,601.47\n\nFinal cash and cash equivalents: $7,010,601.47\n\nTherefore, the net increase (or change) in cash and cash equivalents is:\n$7,010,601.47 - $8,000,000.00 = -$989,398.53\n\nThis represents a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $989,398.53.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Increase': '-989398.53'} }\n```",
