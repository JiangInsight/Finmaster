The account labeled \"Paid-in Capital\" represents the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares.\n\n2. The initial amount for \"Paid-in Capital\" is 13000000.00 as of 2023-12-31.\n\n3. The ending amount for \"Paid-in Capital\" is 13000000.00 as of 2024-01-28.\n\nSince there has been no change in the Paid-in Capital between the initial and end dates, the shareholders did not contribute any additional capital during this period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
