In this kind of statement, depreciation is typically shown as an expense item. The accumulated depreciation line shows how much depreciation expense has been recognized over time.\n\nFrom the balance sheet, I can see:\n- Accumulated Depreciation: Initial amount = 0.00 (on 2023-12-31)\n- Accumulated Depreciation: End amount = 45760.13 (on 2024-01-28)\n\nThis suggests that during this period, the company recognized a depreciation expense of 45760.13, which accumulated from an initial value of 0.\n\nTherefore, the expense item I need to extract is Accumulated Depreciation with:\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- End value: 45760.13\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '45760.13'}}\n```",
