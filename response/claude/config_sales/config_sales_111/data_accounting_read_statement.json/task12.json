These are typically classified as current assets.\n\nFrom the balance sheet provided, I can see that \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of assets that meet this criteria. The current assets include:\n- Cash on Hand\n- Bank Deposits\n- Interest Receivable\n- Accounts Receivable\n- Inventory\n\nAccording to the balance sheet:\n- The initial value of Total Current Assets as of 2023-12-31 is 8000000.00\n- The end value of Total Current Assets as of 2024-01-28 is 10261562.67\n\nThese are the values I need to extract for the solution.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10261562.67'}}\n```",
