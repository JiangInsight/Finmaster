When this value is negative, it means inventory has increased. When it's positive, it means inventory has decreased (been reduced).\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement provided, I see:\n- (Increase) Decrease in Inventory: -430000.00\n\nThe negative value indicates this is actually an increase in inventory rather than a decrease. However, the task is asking for the reduction in assets held for sale, which would be represented by this line but with the opposite sign.\n\nTherefore, the value of the reduction in assets held for sale (inventory) is -430000.00, representing an increase rather than a reduction.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-430000.00'}}\n```",
