The net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement to find these values:\n\nFor the first item (interest accrued but not yet received), I need to look for Interest Receivable on the Balance Sheet. I can see:\n- Interest Receivable: End_amount = 11346.19 (2024-01-28)\n\nFor the second item (net addition in cash and cash equivalents), I need to look at the Cash Flow Statement. I can find:\n- Net Increase: 365772.68 (2024-01-28)\n\nThis appears at the bottom of the Cash Flow Statement, showing the net change in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '11346.19', 'value2': '365772.68'} }\n```",
