This account represents interest that has been earned but not yet received, which is exactly what I'm looking for.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- The initial amount for \"Interest Receivable\" on 2023-12-31 is 0.00\n- The end amount for \"Interest Receivable\" on 2024-01-28 is 11346.19\n\nTherefore, the interest accrued but not yet received had an initial value of 0.00 and an end value of 11346.19.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '11346.19'}}\n```",
