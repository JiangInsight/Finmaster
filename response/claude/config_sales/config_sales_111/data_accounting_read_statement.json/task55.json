First, I'll check the balance sheet:\n   - There's a line item \"Taxes Payable\" with an End_amount of 288001.20 as of 2024-01-28\n   - This represents the outstanding tax liability, not necessarily the total tax expense for the period\n\n2. Next, let's examine the cash flow statement:\n   - There's a line \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an amount of 288001.20\n   - This shows the change in tax payable during the period\n\n3. Finally, checking the income statement:\n   - There's a specific line item \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of 288001.20\n   - This represents the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay for the reporting period\n\nThe \"Tax Expense\" line in the income statement most directly answers the question about the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '288001.20'} }\n```",
