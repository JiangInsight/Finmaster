The item related to tax accrued but not yet paid would be labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" since tax payable represents taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid to tax authorities.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement, I can see:\n- \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with a value of 288001.20\n\nThis positive amount indicates an increase in tax payable during the period, meaning more taxes were accrued than were paid.\n\nTherefore, the specific value for the increase in the amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid is 288001.20.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '288001.20'}}\n```",
