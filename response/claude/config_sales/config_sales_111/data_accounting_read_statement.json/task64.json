Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense (Profit Before Tax)\n2. Addition in amount owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit (Increase in Accounts Payable)\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares (Paid-in Capital)\n\nLet me examine each financial statement:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- Paid-in Capital: 13000000.00 (End_amount)\n- Accounts Payable: 1260000.00 (End_amount)\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- Profit Before Tax: 1393266.97\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable: 1260000.00\n\nSo the three values I need to extract are:\n1. Paid-in Capital: 13000000.00\n2. Profit Before Tax: 1393266.97\n3. Accounts Payable (or Increase in Accounts Payable): 1260000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1393266.97', 'value3': '1260000.00'}}\n```",
