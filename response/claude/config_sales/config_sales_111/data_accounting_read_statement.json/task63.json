Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from the entity's principal revenue-producing activities (from Cash Flow Statement)\n2. Amounts of taxes accrued but not yet paid (from Balance Sheet)\n3. Total income arising in the course of an entity's ordinary activities (from Income Statement)\n\nLet me analyze each statement:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- \"Taxes Payable\" represents taxes accrued but not yet paid: 288001.20\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- \"Total Revenue\" represents total income from ordinary activities: 5760023.09\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" represents cash generated from principal revenue-producing activities: 803237.11\n\nTherefore, the three values I need to extract are:\n- value1 (taxes accrued but not yet paid): 288001.20\n- value2 (total income from ordinary activities): 5760023.09\n- value3 (net cash flow from operating activities): 803237.11\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '288001.20', 'value2': '5760023.09', 'value3': '803237.11'}}\n```",
