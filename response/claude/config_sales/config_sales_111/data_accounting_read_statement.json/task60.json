This represents the funds deposited into a bank.\n\nFrom the Income Statement, I see the \"Interest Income\" line item with an amount of 11346.19 as of 2024-01-28. This represents income earned from financial assets.\n\nTherefore, the two values I need to extract are:\n- value1 (Bank Deposits): 3502535.57\n- value2 (Interest Income): 11346.19\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3502535.57', 'value2': '11346.19'}}\n```",
