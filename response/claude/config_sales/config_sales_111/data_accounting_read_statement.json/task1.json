To get the total cash position, I need to sum these amounts:\n\nInitial total cash: 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 8,000,000.00\nEnd total cash: 4,863,237.11 + 3,502,535.57 = 8,365,772.68\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '8365772.68'}}\n```",
