These are exactly the kinds of tangible items described in the task.\n\nThe balance sheet shows:\n- Fixed Assets initial amount: 5000000.00 on 2023-12-31\n- Fixed Assets end amount: 5437464.43 on 2024-01-28\n\nThese represent the tangible items held for business use.\n\nNote: While Accumulated Depreciation is related to fixed assets, it represents the reduction in value rather than the tangible items themselves, so I'm focusing on the Fixed Assets line item.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5437464.43'}}\n```",
