The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $1876.28, leading to a total amount due of $35649.22. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\nThe inconsistencies are:\n1. Category: Should be \"Sale\" not \"Depreciation\"\n2. Date: Should be 2024-01-21 not 2024-02-13\n3. Quantity: Should be 1.0 not 0.0\n4. Unit price: Should be $37525.50 not $37045.86\n5. Tax amount: Should be $1876.28 not $33533.65\n\nLet me format the complete solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Depreciation\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-21\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-02-13\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"0.0\", \"Original price\": \"37525.50\", \"Recorded price\": \"37045.86\", \"Original receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original amount\": \"37525.50\", \"Recorded amount\": \"0.0\", \"Original tax\": \"1876.28\", \"Recorded tax\": \"33533.65\", \"Original profit\": \"17525.50\", \"Recorded profit\": \"17525.50\", \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240121086\"}}\n```",
