I'll check to confirm if there are any calculation errors or other types of inconsistencies.\n\nFor most transactions, the amount, quantity, unit price, payment method, and other details in the recorded fields match what's stated in the invoice, which is good.\n\nLet me focus on this one confirmed inconsistency:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': 'Account Payable', 'Recorded payment_method': 'Cash', 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Purchase20231231009'} }\n```",
