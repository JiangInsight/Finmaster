For the transaction ID \"Expense20240106001\" with recorded_type \"Financial Expenses\", I notice in the invoice description it states: \"On January 06, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sales Expenses, totaling $25602.95.\" However, the recorded_type is \"Financial Expenses\". This is a category mismatch between the invoice and the recorded type.\n\n2. For the transactions with ID \"Initial20231231001\", I see duplicate IDs used for three different transaction types (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, and Fixed Assets). This is unusual as transaction IDs should typically be unique, but since they all appear to be initial setup entries, this may be intentional.\n\n3. Looking through other transactions, comparing invoice descriptions with recorded data, everything else appears consistent.\n\nSo the main inconsistency I found is with Expense20240106001, where the recorded category differs from what's stated in the invoice.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Recorded category': 'Financial Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240106001'} }\n```",
