The correct unit price should be 20000.00 (not 19167.08)\n2. The correct total amount should be 200000.00 (not 240690.92)\n\nSince the invoice is generally considered more reliable due to its regulated nature, I'll use that as the source of truth.\n\nLet me check for any other discrepancies in the table.\n\nI don't see other obvious inconsistencies in the transactions after reviewing them. The main issue is with Purchase20231231019 where both the recorded price and total amount don't match what's stated in the invoice.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '20000.0', 'Recorded price': '19167.08', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '200000.0', 'Recorded amount': '240690.92', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Purchase20231231019'} }\n```",
