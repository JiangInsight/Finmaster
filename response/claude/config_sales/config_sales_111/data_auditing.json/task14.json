The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $1919.55, leading to a total amount due of $36471.37. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\nInconsistencies:\n1. The recorded quantity is 0.0, but the invoice states 1.0 units\n2. The recorded amount is 0.0, but the invoice states $38390.92\n3. The recorded payment/receipt_status is \"Unpaid\", but the invoice states \"paid\"\n\nThis shows multiple inconsistencies between the recorded data and the invoice.\n\n## Sale20240117028 (from example)\nLooking at the example with confirmed issues:\n- Recorded quantity: `5.0`\n- Recorded payment/receipt_status: `Unpaid` \n\nWhile the invoice states: \"On January 17, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 4.0 units at a unit price of $12645.90, totaling $50583.60. The cost amount for this transaction was $40000.00, with a tax amount of $2529.18, leading to a total amount due of $48054.42. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\nThis matches the example solution where the original quantity was 4.0 but recorded as 5.0, and payment status was originally \"Paid\" but recorded as \"Unpaid\".\n\nBased on my analysis, the most significant inconsistency is in Sale20240106021, where multiple fields (quantity, amount, and payment status) don't match the invoice information.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '1.00', 'Recorded quantity': '0.00', 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '38390.92', 'Recorded amount': '0.00', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240106021'} }\n```",
