I'll use the invoice information as the reliable source of truth since it's standardized and regulated.\n\nLet me examine the transactions carefully:\n\nStarting with Sale20240120081:\n- The recorded_type is \"Sales Expenses\" but the invoice description clearly states it's a \"Sale\"\n- The recorded_quantity is 2.0 but the invoice mentions \"consisting of 3.0 units\"\n- The invoice mentions total amount of $26980.47, but the recorded_amount is $17986.98\n- The invoice mentions profit of $11980.47, but the recorded_profit is only showing $11980.47\n\nIn this case, there are multiple inconsistencies between the recorded information and what's in the invoice:\n\n1. Transaction type: Should be \"Sale\" but is recorded as \"Sales Expenses\"\n2. Quantity: Should be 3.0 but is recorded as 2.0\n3. Amount: Should be $26980.47 but is recorded as $17986.98 (this is likely due to the incorrect quantity)\n\nBased on the invoice information which is considered more reliable, the correct values should be:\n- Category: Sale (not Sales Expenses)\n- Quantity: 3.0 (not 2.0)\n- Amount: $26980.47 (not $17986.98)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"3.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"2.0\", \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"26980.47\", \"Recorded amount\": \"17986.98\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240120081\"}}\n```",
