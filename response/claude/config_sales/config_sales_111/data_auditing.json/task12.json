Transaction ID `Expense20240127001` (Sales Expenses) - The recorded_approver field is empty, but the invoice states \"This transaction was prepared by Senior Staff, and the approver is Director.\"\n\n2. Transaction ID `Expense20240115001` (Administrative Expenses) - In this transaction, there seems to be a missing approver as well. The invoice mentions \"This transaction was prepared by Senior Staff, and the approver is Director,\" but the recorded_approver field is empty.\n\nLet me prepare the solution for both issues:\n\nFor `Expense20240127001`:\n- Original Approver: Director (from invoice)\n- Recorded Approver: None (missing in data)\n\nFor `Expense20240115001`:\n- Original Approver: Director (from invoice)\n- Recorded Approver: None (missing in data)\n\nSince the example solution focused on one issue with `Expense20240115001`, I'll provide my solution for that transaction:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': 'Director', 'Recorded Approver': 'None', 'id': 'Expense20240127001'} }\n```",
