The cost amount for this transaction was $60000.00, with a tax amount of $5513.59, leading to a total amount due of $104758.25. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\nThe inconsistencies are:\n1. Date: Recorded as January 16, but invoice says January 14\n2. Quantity: Recorded as 2.0 units, but invoice says 3.0 units\n3. Unit price: Recorded as $41,733.96, but invoice says $36,757.28\n4. Total amount: Recorded as $73,514.56, but invoice says $110,271.84\n\nLet me double-check these calculations:\n- Original calculation: 3.0 units × $36,757.28 = $110,271.84 ✓\n- Recorded calculation: 2.0 units × $41,733.96 = $83,467.92 (which doesn't match the recorded amount of $73,514.56, indicating another error)\n\nSince the invoice is generally considered more reliable based on the task description, I'll trust the invoice information as the correct data.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-14', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-16', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '3.0', 'Recorded quantity': '2.0', 'Original price': '36757.28', 'Recorded price': '41733.96', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '110271.84', 'Recorded amount': '73514.56', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240114051'} }\n```",
