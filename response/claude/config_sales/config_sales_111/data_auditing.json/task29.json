Let me analyze the recorded values vs. the invoice description:\n   - Recorded date: 2024-01-28\n   - Recorded amount: $29,451.85\n   - Recorded unit price: $8,369.43\n   - Recorded tax amount: $25,478.46\n\n2. The invoice description states:\n   \"On January 02, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 3.0 units at a unit price of $8620.88, totaling $25862.64. The cost amount for this transaction was $15000.00, with a tax amount of $1293.13, leading to a total amount due of $24569.51...\"\n\n3. Comparing these values:\n   - Date: Recorded as January 28, but invoice says January 02\n   - Unit price: Recorded as $8,369.43, but invoice says $8,620.88\n   - Total amount: Recorded as $29,451.85, but invoice says $25,862.64\n   - Tax amount: Recorded as $25,478.46, but invoice says $1,293.13\n\n4. The invoice data is more reliable, and there are multiple inconsistencies in this transaction.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": \"2024-01-02\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-28\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"8620.88\", \"Recorded price\": \"8369.43\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"25862.64\", \"Recorded amount\": \"29451.85\", \"Original tax\": \"1293.13\", \"Recorded tax\": \"25478.46\", \"Original profit\": \"10862.64\", \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240102005\"}}\n```",
