Purchase20231231017 - The invoice mentions Senior Staff as preparer but it's not recorded\n2. Expense20240125001 - The invoice mentions Staff as preparer but it's not recorded\n\nBased on my analysis, here's the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original Preparer\": \"Senior Staff\", \"Recorded Preparer\": \"None\", \"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Purchase20231231017\"}}\n```",
