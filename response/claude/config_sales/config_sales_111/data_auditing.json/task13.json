The recorded_type is \"Purchase\" but the invoice clearly states it was a \"Sale\"\n2. The recorded_tax_amount is 35140.99, but according to the invoice, it should be 1993.26 (calculated from unit price Ã— tax rate)\n3. The after-tax amount is correct (37871.99), the unit price is correct (39865.25), and the profit amount is correct (19865.25)\n4. This suggests an error in both the transaction category and tax amount\n\nFor the transaction \"Sale20240123095\":\n- Original category should be \"Sale\" instead of \"Purchase\"\n- Original tax amount should be 1993.26 instead of 35140.99\n\nI don't see any other transactions with clear discrepancies based on comparing the fields with the invoice descriptions. The invoice field serves as a reliable reference since it's standardized and regulated.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Purchase', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': '1993.26', 'Recorded tax': '35140.99', 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240123095'} }",
