Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $1,548,001.20\n   (Since there are no non-current liabilities listed)\n\n2. Total Owner's Equity = $14,105,265.77\n\nNow I'll calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio:\n```\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $1,548,001.20 / $14,105,265.77 = 0.10974...\n```\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: 0.11\n\nTherefore, the Debt to Equity Ratio as of 2024-01-28 is 0.11.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11'}}\n```",
