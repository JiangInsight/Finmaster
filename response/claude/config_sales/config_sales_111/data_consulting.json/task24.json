Debt to Asset Ratio\n\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated as: Total Debt / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities (Debt) = $1,548,001.20 (from Total Current Liabilities)\n- Total Assets = $15,653,266.97\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $1,548,001.20 / $15,653,266.97 = 0.0989 ≈ 0.10\n\n## 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nThis ratio is calculated as: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Income\n\nFrom the financial statements:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = $803,237.11\n- Net Income (Net Profit) = $1,105,265.77\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = $803,237.11 / $1,105,265.77 = 0.7268 ≈ 0.73\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '0.73'}}\n```",
