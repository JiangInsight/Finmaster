Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: $803,237.11 (from the cash flow statement)\n2. Total Current Liabilities: $1,548,001.20 (from the balance sheet as of 2024-01-28)\n\nTo calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = $803,237.11 / $1,548,001.20\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = 0.5189 â‰ˆ 0.52\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is 0.52.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.52'} }\n```",
