For sales transactions, I need to verify the math: recorded_amount should equal recorded_quantity Ã— recorded_unit_price\n2. The tax calculations should be consistent with the amounts\n3. The profit calculations should match cost_amount vs total amounts\n4. The invoice description should match the recorded fields\n\nLet me analyze each transaction carefully.\n\nLooking at the data, I notice an issue with Sale20240114054:\n\nIn this sale transaction:\n- The recorded_tax_amount is 55427.62\n- The unit price is 19763.92\n- The quantity is 3.0\n- The total amount is 59291.76\n\nTo verify the tax amount, I need to check if it's approximately 5% of the total amount:\n- 5% of 59291.76 would be about 2964.59\n- The recorded tax amount (55427.62) is much higher than expected\n- The invoice mentions \"with a tax amount of $2964.59\" which conflicts with the recorded value\n\nThis is clearly an internal inconsistency where the recorded tax amount doesn't match what's in the invoice description.\n\nThe correct tax amount should be 2964.59, not 55427.62.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": \"2964.59\", \"Recorded tax\": \"55427.62\", \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240114054\"}}\n```",
