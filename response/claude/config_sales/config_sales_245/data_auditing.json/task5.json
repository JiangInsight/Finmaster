I also notice that the recorded_amount ($25000.0) doesn't match what would be expected for 7 units at $5000 each ($35000), confirming the inconsistency.\n\nLet me check if there are other discrepancies:\nIn Sale20240103006:\n- I see the transaction involved Premium Product D\n- The invoice states 2.0 units at $89885.20 per unit, totaling $179770.40\n- The recorded values match what's in the invoice\n- No inconsistency detected in this transaction\n\nI need to thoroughly check all transactions for potential issues comparing recorded values against what's stated in the invoice descriptions.\n\nAfter reviewing all transactions, I've identified a clear inconsistency in Purchase20231231012 where the recorded quantity (5.0) doesn't match the invoice description (7.0 units). The recorded amount ($25000.0) is consistent with 5 units at $5000 each, but the invoice states a total of $35000.00 which would be for 7 units. Since the invoice is considered more reliable, the correct quantity appears to be 7.0 units.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original quantity\": \"7.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"5.0\", \"id\": \"Purchase20231231012\"}}\n```",
