Transaction ID: Expense20240112001 (Sales Expenses)\n   - Original Approver: Director (from invoice)\n   - Recorded Approver: None (missing in record)\n\n2. Transaction ID: Expense20240115001 (Administrative Expenses)\n   - Original Approver: Director (from invoice)\n   - Recorded Approver: None (missing in record)\n\nLet me provide the solution for the first inconsistency I found, as the example shows returning just one:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': 'Director', 'Recorded Approver': 'None', 'id': 'Expense20240112001'} }\n```",
