I'll pay special attention to the invoice field since it's considered more reliable.\n\nLet me go through the transactions and identify inconsistencies:\n\nFor transaction `Sale20240122083`:\n1. The recorded type is \"Depreciation\" but the invoice clearly shows it's a \"Sale\" transaction.\n2. The recorded amount is $124,650.19, but according to the invoice, it should be $105,198.99. This can be calculated from the unit price ($35,066.33) Ã— quantity (3), which equals $105,198.99.\n3. The invoice also mentions after-tax amount of $99,939.04, tax amount of $5,259.95, and profit of $45,198.99 - all consistent with a sale amount of $105,198.99, not $124,650.19.\n\nThis is a clear inconsistency where both the transaction type and the amount are incorrectly recorded.\n\nI don't see other significant inconsistencies in the data that can be definitively established based on the available information and fields. Some transactions have multiple entries with the same ID but different types, which appears to be normal for this dataset.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Depreciation', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '105198.99', 'Recorded amount': '124650.19', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240122083'} }\n```",
