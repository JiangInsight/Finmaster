The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $1897.41, leading to a total amount due of $36050.81. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\nThe inconsistencies I observe:\n1. Quantity: Recorded is 1.0, invoice states 2.0\n2. Unit price: Recorded is $20,692.61, invoice states $18,974.11\n3. Total amount: Recorded is $18,974.11, invoice states $37,948.22 (which is 2 Ã— $18,974.11)\n4. Tax amount: Recorded is $38,290.83, invoice states $1,897.41 (which is 5% of $37,948.22)\n\nBased on the invoice, the correct values should be:\n- Quantity: 2.0\n- Unit price: $18,974.11\n- Total amount: $37,948.22\n- Tax amount: $1,897.41\n\nThe recorded amount of $18,974.11 appears to be the unit price mistakenly used as the total amount, and the tax amount of $38,290.83 is completely incorrect.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original quantity': '2.0', 'Recorded quantity': '1.0', 'Original price': '18974.11', 'Recorded price': '20692.61', 'Original amount': '37948.22', 'Recorded amount': '18974.11', 'Original tax': '1897.41', 'Recorded tax': '38290.83', 'Original profit': '17948.22', 'Recorded profit': '17948.22', 'id': 'Sale20240103005'}}",
