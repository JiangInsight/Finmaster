The cost amount for this transaction was $5000.00, with a tax amount of $478.06, leading to a total amount due of $9083.07. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\nHowever, the recorded_amount is $11439.62, which doesn't match the invoice's stated amount of $9561.13.\n\nAlso, the recorded_unit_price is $10618.35, but the invoice states the unit price should be $9561.13.\n\nThis transaction shows three inconsistencies:\n1. An incorrect category (recorded as expense instead of sale)\n2. An incorrect amount ($11439.62 vs $9561.13)\n3. An incorrect unit price ($10618.35 vs $9561.13)\n\nI'll compile this in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '9561.13', 'Recorded price': '10618.35', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '9561.13', 'Recorded amount': '11439.62', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240121076'}}\n```",
