Since the invoice is considered more reliable as a standardized document, the original category should be \"Sales Expenses\" while the recorded category is incorrectly listed as \"Financial Expenses\".\n\nThere's no need to correct other fields as they appear consistent with the invoice description.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Recorded category': 'Financial Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240128001'} }\n```",
