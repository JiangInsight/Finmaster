Looking at Expense20240122001 (Administrative Expenses):\n   - The recorded date is \"2024-02-01\"\n   - But in the invoice text it states \"On January 22, 2024\"\n   - The recorded amount is $33,111.29\n   - But the invoice text states \"totaling $28,780.85\"\n   \nThis is a clear inconsistency - both the date and amount in the recorded fields don't match what's in the invoice.\n\nLet me continue looking at Interest20240114014:\n\n2. For Interest20240114014:\n   - The invoice states \"On January 14, 2024\" but the recorded date is \"2024-01-16\"\n   - The invoice states \"totaling $335.53\" but the recorded amount is \"17.64\"\n   \nThis is another inconsistency.\n\nI don't see other clear inconsistencies among the remaining entries where the recorded information contradicts what appears in the invoice description.\n\nBased on my analysis, I'll prepare the solution for both identified inconsistencies:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-22', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-01', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '28780.85', 'Recorded amount': '33111.29', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240122001'} }",
