The recorded_type is \"Administrative Expenses\" but the transaction ID has \"Purchase\" prefix\n2. The invoice description states it's a \"Purchase\" transaction\n3. There's a discrepancy in the quantity - the invoice states 7.0 units but the recorded_quantity shows 6.0\n4. The invoice total amount of $35000.00 matches 7 units at $5000.00 each, not 6 units\n\nFor transaction Sale20240102002, while not as obvious, I see:\n1. The transaction appears normal with no internal inconsistencies between fields\n\nLet me check Purchase20231231001:\n1. All fields seem internally consistent\n\nContinuing through the data, I don't see other clear inconsistencies where the transaction details conflict with the invoice description.\n\nBased on my analysis, I'll provide a structured response for the identified issue:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Purchase\", \"Recorded category\": \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"7.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"6.0\", \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"35000.0\", \"Recorded amount\": \"30000.0\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Purchase20231231023\"}}\n```",
