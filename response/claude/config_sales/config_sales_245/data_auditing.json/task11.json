This is an inconsistency that needs to be reported.\n\nSimilarly, in `Expense20240125001`, the invoice mentions \"This transaction was prepared by Staff\", but the `recorded_preparer` field is empty.\n\nI'll continue checking for any additional inconsistencies...\n\nAfter reviewing all transactions, I've found that the main inconsistencies involve missing preparer information where the invoice text clearly indicates who prepared the transaction.\n\nFor the transaction `Expense20240117001`, the recorded preparer is missing (showing as None/empty), but according to the invoice description, it was prepared by Staff.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original Preparer\": \"Staff\", \"Recorded Preparer\": \"None\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Expense20240117001\"}}\n```",
