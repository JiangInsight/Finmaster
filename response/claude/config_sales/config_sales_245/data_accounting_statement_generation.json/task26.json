This suggests that this is the only depreciation entry in the given time period.\n\nSince depreciation is typically a periodic expense (recorded monthly, quarterly, or annually), and there's only one entry for the period covered by these transactions, the amount of 45757.71 represents the total depreciation expense for the income statement.\n\nTherefore, the final depreciation item in the income statement is 45757.71.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45757.71'} }\n```",
