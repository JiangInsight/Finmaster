In accounting, depreciation appears as an expense in the income statement but is added back in the cash flow statement (because it's a non-cash expense).\n\nFirst, let me find any transactions with \"Depreciation\" type:\n\nI found one transaction in the data:\n- Transaction id: Depreciation20240101001\n- Type: Depreciation\n- Date: 2024-01-01\n- Amount: 45757.71\n\nThis appears to be the only depreciation transaction in the dataset. The depreciation amount is 45757.71.\n\nIn a cash flow statement, depreciation is a non-cash expense that gets added back to net income when calculating cash flow from operations.\n\nTherefore, the final depreciation item in the cash flow statement is 45757.71.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45757.71'} }\n```",
