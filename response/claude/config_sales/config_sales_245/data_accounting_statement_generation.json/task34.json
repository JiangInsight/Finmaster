The net profit value should capture all the profit-related entries.\n\nRe-checking, I find that using the \"profit\" column in the sale transactions provides a more direct approach:\n\n### Total Profit from Sales\nSum of \"profit\" column from all sale transactions: $2,713,730.62\n\n### Operating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses remain: $946,511.19\n\n### Interest Income\nTotal interest income remains: $11,029.69\n\n### Final Net Profit Calculation\nNet Profit = Total Profit from Sales - Operating Expenses + Interest Income\nNet Profit = $2,713,730.62 - $946,511.19 + $11,029.69\nNet Profit = $1,778,249.12\n\nTherefore, the final net profit is $1,778,249.12.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '1778249.12'} }\n```",
