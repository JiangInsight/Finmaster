Let me work through this step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Calculate Main Business Revenue\nFirst, I need to identify all sales transactions to calculate the total revenue.\n\nLooking at all entries with type \"Sale\", I'll sum up the amount column for these transactions:\n```\nTotal Sales: 5,892,964.54\n```\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\nFor each sale, the cost_amount column shows the cost of goods sold:\n```\nTotal COGS: 3,365,000.00\n```\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Gross Profit\nGross Profit = Total Revenue - COGS:\n```\nGross Profit = 5,892,964.54 - 3,365,000.00 = 2,527,964.54\n```\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Operating Expenses\nI'll group expenses by their types:\n\n### Administrative Expenses\nLooking at all entries with type \"Administrative Expenses\":\n```\nTotal Administrative Expenses: 235,236.51\n```\n\n### Sales Expenses\nLooking at all entries with type \"Sales Expenses\":\n```\nTotal Sales Expenses: 693,982.46\n```\n\n### Depreciation\nFrom the entry with type \"Depreciation\":\n```\nTotal Depreciation: 45,757.71\n```\n\n### Financial Expenses\nLooking at all entries with type \"Financial Expenses\":\n```\nTotal Financial Expenses: 160,127.75\n```\n\n### Total Expenses\nSum of all operating expenses:\n```\nTotal Expenses = 235,236.51 + 693,982.46 + 45,757.71 + 160,127.75 = 1,135,104.43\n```\n\n## Step 5: Calculate Interest Income\nLooking at all entries with type \"Interest Receivables\":\n```\nTotal Interest Income: 9,389.67\n```\n\n## Step 6: Calculate Tax Expense\nThe tax_amount column in the sales transactions indicates the tax paid:\n```\nTotal Tax Expense: 294,648.23\n```\n\n## Step 7: Calculate Net Profit\nNet Profit = Gross Profit - Total Expenses + Interest Income - Tax Expense:\n```\nNet Profit = 2,527,964.54 - 1,135,104.43 + 9,389.67 - 294,648.23 = 1,107,601.55\n```\n\n## Step 8: Profit Before Tax\nProfit Before Tax = Net Profit + Tax Expense:\n```\nProfit Before Tax = 1,107,601.55 + 294,648.23 = 1,402,249.78\n```\n\nLet me verify these calculations one more time to ensure accuracy:\n\n- The main business revenue (total sales): 5,892,964.54\n- The total cost of goods sold: 3,365,000.00 \n- Gross profit: 2,527,964.54\n- Administrative expenses: 235,236.51\n- Sales/selling expenses: 693,982.46\n- Depreciation: 45,757.71\n- Financial expenses: 160,127.75\n- Total expenses: 1,135,104.43\n- Interest income: 9,389.67\n- Profit before tax: 1,402,249.78\n- Tax expense: 294,648.23\n- Net profit: 1,107,601.55\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Main Business Revenue\": \"5892964.54\", \"Total Revenue\": \"5892964.54\", \"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"3365000.00\", \"Total Cost\": \"3365000.00\", \"Gross Profit\": \"2527964.54\", \"Administrative Expenses\": \"235236.51\", \"Selling Expenses\": \"693982.46\", \"Depreciation\": \"45757.71\", \"Financial Expenses\": \"160127.75\", \"Total Expenses\": \"1135104.43\", \"Interest Income\": \"9389.67\", \"Profit Before Tax\": \"1402249.78\", \"Tax Expense\": \"294648.23\", \"Net Profit\": \"1107601.55\"}}\n```",
