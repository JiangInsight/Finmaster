Fixed asset transactions will typically be categorized as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar types.\n\nLet me analyze the data:\n\nScanning through all the transactions in the problem, I'm looking for any entries that represent the purchase of fixed assets. In a typical cash flow statement, this would represent capital expenditures or purchases of property, plant, and equipment.\n\nIn the data provided, I can see there are no explicit \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" type transactions. Unlike the example where there was a transaction with type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" with an amount of 305354.43, I don't see any similar entries in the current problem.\n\nThe transactions I see include:\n- Initial deposits\n- Purchases of products/inventory\n- Sales\n- Expenses (Administrative, Sales, Financial)\n- Interest receivables\n- Depreciation\n\nNone of these transactions represent purchases of fixed assets. There is an initial fixed assets entry of 5,000,000 but this appears to be an opening balance rather than a purchase during the period.\n\nSince there are no fixed asset purchase transactions in the data provided for the current problem, the amount for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the cash flow statement would be zero.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '0'} }\n```",
