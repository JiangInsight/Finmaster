The \"type\" column contains \"Sales Expenses\"\n2. The date falls within the appropriate reporting period\n\nLet me go through the data and sum up all the sales expenses:\n\nJanuary 1, 2024: 16,483.36\nJanuary 2, 2024: 18,455.69\nJanuary 3, 2024: 3,828.85 + 28,109.74 = 31,938.59\nJanuary 4, 2024: 17,877.99 + 29,677.19 = 47,555.18\nJanuary 5, 2024: 4,496.49 + 26,287.39 = 30,783.88\nJanuary 6, 2024: 18,272.65 + 10,546.48 = 28,819.13\nJanuary 8, 2024: 10,577.36 + 14,994.33 = 25,571.69\nJanuary 9, 2024: 24,567.37\nJanuary 10, 2024: 29,218.39\nJanuary 11, 2024: 23,639.86 + 15,612.99 = 39,252.85\nJanuary 12, 2024: 20,136.77\nJanuary 13, 2024: 12,167.96\nJanuary 15, 2024: 27,265.78\nJanuary 16, 2024: 26,626.70 + 29,908.73 = 56,535.43\nJanuary 17, 2024: 14,925.27 + 18,769.64 = 33,694.91\nJanuary 18, 2024: 3,014.12\nJanuary 20, 2024: 8,381.10\nJanuary 21, 2024: 26,513.68 + 20,438.81 = 46,952.49\nJanuary 22, 2024: 20,222.68 + 9,445.79 = 29,668.47\nJanuary 23, 2024: 28,036.39\nJanuary 24, 2024: 29,168.55 + 27,749.05 + 22,998.87 = 79,916.47\nJanuary 25, 2024: 25,012.40 + 11,531.60 = 36,544.00\nJanuary 26, 2024: 25,799.95\nJanuary 27, 2024: 6,861.03 + 18,560.22 = 25,421.25\nJanuary 28, 2024: 22,072.76 + 17,274.20 = 39,346.96\nJanuary 29, 2024: 17,247.75\n\nAdding all these figures:\n16,483.36 + 18,455.69 + 31,938.59 + 47,555.18 + 30,783.88 + 28,819.13 + 25,571.69 + 24,567.37 + 29,218.39 + 39,252.85 + 20,136.77 + 12,167.96 + 27,265.78 + 56,535.43 + 33,694.91 + 3,014.12 + 8,381.10 + 46,952.49 + 29,668.47 + 28,036.39 + 79,916.47 + 36,544.00 + 25,799.95 + 25,421.25 + 39,346.96 + 17,247.75 = 782,775.93\n\nHmm, this doesn't match the expected answer format. Let me double-check my calculation by reviewing each line item again.\n\nAfter re-reviewing the data, I notice that the total should be 782,775.93.\n\nLet me verify if there are any calculation errors or transactions I might have missed.\n\nLooking at the data again, I find that the correct total of all Sales Expenses transactions is:\n\nTotal Sales Expenses: 782,775.93\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Selling Expenses': '782775.93'} }\n```",
