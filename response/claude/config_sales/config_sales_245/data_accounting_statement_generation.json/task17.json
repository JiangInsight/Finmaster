Retained earnings represent accumulated profits (or losses) that haven't been distributed to owners.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the data structure and what I need to calculate\nRetained earnings are calculated as: Beginning Retained Earnings + Net Income (Revenue - Expenses) - Dividends\n\nSince no dividends are mentioned, I'll focus on calculating the net income from the transactions.\n\n## Step 2: Determine initial retained earnings\nFor a new business, initial retained earnings are typically zero. I don't see any explicit opening balance for retained earnings, so I'll assume it starts at 0.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate revenue from sales\nLet me sum up all the sales transactions to determine total revenue:\n\nLooking at all transactions with \"Sale\" in the type, I need to sum the \"amount\" column.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate all expenses\nI need to add up:\n- Cost of goods sold (found in \"cost_amount\" column of sales)\n- Administrative expenses\n- Sales expenses\n- Financial expenses\n- Depreciation\n\n## Step 5: Calculate net income and final retained earnings\n\nLet me go through all the transactions one by one:\n\n```\nSales revenue = Sum of all sale transaction amounts\nCOGS = Sum of all cost_amount values in sales transactions\nGross profit = Sales revenue - COGS\nExpenses = Sum of Administrative, Sales, Financial Expenses and Depreciation\nNet income = Gross profit - Expenses\nFinal retained earnings = Initial retained earnings + Net income\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the transactions:\n\n- Total Sales Revenue: $5,764,343.37\n- Total COGS: $3,360,000.00\n- Gross Profit: $2,404,343.37\n- Total Expenses:\n  - Administrative Expenses: $1,185,702.38\n  - Sales Expenses: $654,175.22\n  - Financial Expenses: $244,850.49\n  - Depreciation: $45,757.71\n  - Total: $2,130,485.80\n- Net Income: $273,857.57\n\nSince the initial retained earnings are $0.00, the final retained earnings are $273,857.57.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Retained Earnings Initial Value': '0.00', 'Retained Earnings End Value': '273,857.57'} }",
