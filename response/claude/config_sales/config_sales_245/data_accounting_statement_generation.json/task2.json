Find the initial bank deposit amount\n2. Track all transactions affecting the bank deposit balance\n3. Calculate the final bank deposit value\n\n## Step 1: Identify the initial bank deposit amount\nFrom the data, I can see there's an initial bank deposit entry:\n```\n| Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n```\nSo the initial bank deposit value is 5,000,000.00.\n\n## Step 2: Track all transactions affecting the bank deposit balance\n\nI need to identify all transactions that would increase or decrease the bank deposit balance:\n\n### Outflows (decreasing bank balance):\n- Purchases paid via \"Bank Transfer\"\n- Fixed asset purchases paid via \"Bank Transfer\"\n\n### Inflows (increasing bank balance):\n- Cash to bank transfers\n- Sales paid directly to bank\n\nLet me collect all these transactions:\n\n#### Purchases paid via Bank Transfer:\n- Purchase20231231001: 200,000.00\n- Purchase20231231002: 500,000.00\n- Purchase20231231003: 70,000.00\n- Purchase20231231006: 200,000.00\n- Purchase20231231010: 140,000.00\n- Purchase20231231015: 120,000.00\n- Purchase20231231019: 15,000.00\n- Purchase20231231024: 100,000.00\n\nTotal purchases paid via bank transfer: 1,345,000.00\n\n#### Cash to bank transfers:\nI don't see any explicit cash to bank transfer transactions in this dataset.\n\n#### Sales directly to bank:\nI don't see any sales explicitly going to the bank account.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the final bank deposit value\n\nStarting bank balance: 5,000,000.00\nTotal outflows: -1,345,000.00\nTotal inflows: 0.00\n\nFinal bank balance = 5,000,000.00 - 1,345,000.00 + 0.00 = 3,655,000.00\n\nWait, I need to be more careful with my analysis. Let me examine the payment methods more closely.\n\nRe-examining the transactions, I only need to count those with \"Bank Transfer\" as the payment method:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 200,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231002: 500,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231003: 70,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231006: 200,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231010: 140,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231015: 120,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231019: 15,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231024: 100,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n\nTotal bank transfers for purchases: 1,345,000.00\n\nSince there are no explicit cash to bank transfers or sales directly to bank account, the final calculation is:\n\nInitial bank balance: 5,000,000.00\nOutflows via bank transfers: -1,345,000.00\nFinal bank balance: 3,655,000.00\n\nTherefore, the bank deposits item in the balance sheet would show:\n- Initial Value: 5,000,000.00\n- End Value: 3,655,000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Bank Deposits Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Bank Deposits End Value': '3655000.00'} }\n```",
