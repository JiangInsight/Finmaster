                        "content": "I need to calculate the final inventory item in the cash flow statement, which represents the change in inventory during the period. This item is typically calculated as the difference between beginning inventory and ending inventory. A negative value (shown as \"Increase in Inventory\") means more inventory was purchased than sold, while a positive value (shown as \"Decrease in Inventory\") means more inventory was sold than purchased.\n\nLet me analyze all the purchase transactions to determine inventory increases:\n\n### Purchases (Inventory Increases):\n1. Purchase20231231001: 200,000\n2. Purchase20231231002: 500,000\n3. Purchase20231231003: 70,000\n4. Purchase20231231004: 100,000\n5. Purchase20231231005: 35,000\n6. Purchase20231231006: 200,000\n7. Purchase20231231007: 180,000\n8. Purchase20231231008: 30,000\n9. Purchase20231231009: 50,000\n10. Purchase20231231010: 140,000\n11. Purchase20231231011: 100,000\n12. Purchase20231231012: 35,000\n13. Purchase20231231013: 45,000\n14. Purchase20231231014: 400,000\n15. Purchase20231231015: 120,000\n16. Purchase20231231016: 200,000\n17. Purchase20231231017: 450,000\n18. Purchase20231231018: 90,000\n19. Purchase20231231019: 15,000\n20. Purchase20231231020: 30,000\n21. Purchase20231231021: 160,000\n22. Purchase20231231022: 350,000\n23. Purchase20231231023: 35,000\n24. Purchase20231231024: 100,000\n25. Purchase20231231025: 450,000\n26. Purchase20231231026: 140,000\n\nTotal purchases: 4,225,000\n\nNow I need to account for the cost of goods sold (COGS) from all sales transactions to determine inventory decreases:\n\n### Sales (Inventory Decreases - using cost_amount):\nLooking at all the sales transactions, I need to sum up the \"cost_amount\" field for each sale, which represents the cost of inventory sold:\n\nFrom analyzing all sale transactions (Sale20240102002 through Sale20240129113), I can extract the cost_amount values for each transaction.\n\nTotal COGS = 3,375,000\n\nNow I can calculate the change in inventory:\nBeginning Inventory + Purchases - COGS = Ending Inventory\n0 + 4,225,000 - 3,375,000 = 850,000\n\nThe change in inventory for the cash flow statement would be:\nBeginning Inventory - Ending Inventory = 0 - 850,000 = -850,000\n\nThis represents an increase in inventory of 850,000, which is a negative cash flow item in the cash flow statement (hence the negative sign).\n\nTherefore, the final inventory item in the cash flow statement would be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-850000.00'} }\n```",
