This is the standard accounting practice - when inventory is sold, its cost is recognized as an expense called \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\nFrom the income statement, I can see:\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 3250000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n\nTherefore, the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is $3,250,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3250000.00'} }\n```",
