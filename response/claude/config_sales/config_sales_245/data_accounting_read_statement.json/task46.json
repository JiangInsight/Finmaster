The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is -$0.00\n2. The only sub-item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of $0.00\n\nNote that the statement shows \"-$0.00\" for the net value (with the negative sign), which indicates an outflow of cash, but since the actual amount is zero, the value is effectively $0.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '0.00'}}}\n```",
