These represent tangible assets used in operations with a useful life of more than one year.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet provided, I can see:\n\n- \"Fixed Assets\" line item shows an initial amount of 5000000.00 as of 2023-12-31\n- The end amount for \"Fixed Assets\" is 5000000.00 as of 2024-01-29\n\nNote that this is the gross value before depreciation. The accumulated depreciation is shown separately, but the task asks for the value of the tangible items themselves, not their net book value.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5000000.00'} }\n```",
