The income earned by an entity from financial assets\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\n### Balance Sheet:\nFor funds deposited into a bank, I should look for \"Bank Deposits\" which has an end amount of 3,655,000.00 as of 2024-01-29.\n\n### Income Statement:\nFor income earned from financial assets, I should look for \"Interest Income\" which shows 10,051.66 as of 2024-01-29.\n\n### Cash Flow Statement:\nI don't see any additional line items that directly correspond to either bank deposits or interest income that would differ from what I've already found.\n\nTherefore, the two values I need to extract are:\n- Bank Deposits (end value): 3,655,000.00\n- Interest Income: 10,051.66\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3655000.00', 'value2': '10051.66'}}\n```",
