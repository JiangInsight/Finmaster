The net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement to find these values:\n\n### Balance Sheet Analysis\nFrom the balance sheet, I can see \"Interest Receivable\" with an end amount of 10051.66. This represents interest that has been earned but not yet received, which is what we're looking for.\n\n### Income Statement Analysis\nThe income statement shows \"Interest Income\" of 10051.66, which matches the Interest Receivable from the balance sheet.\n\n### Cash Flow Statement Analysis\nThe cash flow statement shows a \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents of 215423.24. This represents the net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\nTherefore, the two values I need to extract are:\n1. Interest accrued but not yet received: 10051.66\n2. Net addition in cash and cash equivalents: 215423.24\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '10051.66', 'value2': '215423.24'} }\n```",
