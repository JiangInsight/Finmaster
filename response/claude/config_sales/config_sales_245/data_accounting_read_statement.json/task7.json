In accounting, accumulated depreciation is the cumulative total of depreciation expenses that have been recorded over time.\n\nFrom the provided balance sheet:\n- Initial value of Accumulated Depreciation (2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End value of Accumulated Depreciation (2024-01-29): 45757.71\n\nThis suggests that during the period, a depreciation expense of 45,757.71 was recorded, increasing the accumulated depreciation from 0 to this amount.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '45757.71'}}\n```",
