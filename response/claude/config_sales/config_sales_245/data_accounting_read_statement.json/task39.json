However, the task asks for the reduction in assets held for sale, which corresponds to this line item regardless of whether it's an increase or decrease.\n\nThe value is \"-975000.00\", which represents the change in inventory during the period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-975000.00'}}\n```",
