This account captures the accumulated profits that have been kept within the business rather than distributed as dividends.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Retained Earnings (as of 2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End Retained Earnings (as of 2024-01-29): 1163543.07\n\nThis shows that the company started the period with no retained earnings and ended with positive retained earnings of 1,163,543.07, meaning the company generated profit during this period that was retained in the business.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1163543.07'}}\n```",
