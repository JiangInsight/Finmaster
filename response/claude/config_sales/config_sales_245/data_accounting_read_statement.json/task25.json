The line item \"Selling Expenses\" typically represents costs associated with securing customer orders. These include sales commissions, advertising, marketing, and other costs related to selling products or services.\n\n2. The line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" typically represents the direct costs attributable to the production of goods sold or services provided.\n\nBased on the task description, I need to identify costs related to securing customer orders and delivering goods/services. In this income statement:\n- \"Selling Expenses\" = 782775.93\n- \"Cost of Goods Sold\" = 3250000.00\n\nHowever, the example solution shows that only \"Selling Expenses\" was considered as the answer. This indicates that for this task, we should focus specifically on the selling expenses as the costs incurred to secure customer orders.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '782775.93'}}\n```",
