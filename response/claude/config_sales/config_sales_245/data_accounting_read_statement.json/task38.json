Accounts receivable represents amounts that customers owe to the company for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\nIn the cash flow statement, a negative number for \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" indicates that accounts receivable has increased during the period, meaning more money is owed to the company (which is a use of cash).\n\nFrom the problem statement, I can see that the value for \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is -1133414.13. The negative sign indicates an increase in accounts receivable, which means customers owe more money to the company compared to the beginning of the period.\n\nTherefore, the value representing the decrease (or in this case, an increase shown as a negative number) in amounts owed to the entity is -1133414.13.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1133414.13'}}\n```",
