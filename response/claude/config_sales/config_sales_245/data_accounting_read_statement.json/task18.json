Tangible items held for use in production, supply, rental, or administration (fixed assets)\n3. Tax accrued but not yet paid (tax liability)\n\nAnalyzing the balance sheet:\n\n1. For cash available for day-to-day operations, I need to look at \"Cash on Hand\" which shows:\n   - Initial amount: 3000000.00\n   - End amount: 4560423.24\n\n2. For tangible items held for business use, I need to look at \"Fixed Assets\" which shows:\n   - Initial amount: 5000000.00\n   - End amount: 5000000.00\n\n3. For tax accrued but not yet paid, I need to look at \"Taxes Payable\" which shows:\n   - Initial amount: 0.00\n   - End amount: 299588.25\n\nFilling these values into the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '3000000.00', 'end valu1': '4560423.24', 'initial value2': '5000000.00', 'end valu2': '5000000.00', 'initial value3': '0.00', 'end valu3': '299588.25'}}\n```",
