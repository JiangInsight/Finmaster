Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period\n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole\n\nLet me analyze each element:\n\n1. The total income is represented by \"Total Revenue\" which is 5991764.34\n2. The carrying amount of inventories sold would be \"Cost of Goods Sold\" which is 3250000.00\n3. The costs of general management and administration would be \"Administrative Expenses\" which is 269591.31\n\nTherefore, my solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5991764.34', 'value2': '3250000.00', 'value3': '269591.31'}}\n```",
