First, I'll check the balance sheet:\n   - There is a \"Taxes Payable\" line item with an end amount of 299,588.25 as of 2024-01-29\n\n2. Next, I'll look at the cash flow statement:\n   - There is an \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" line item with an amount of 299,588.25\n\n3. Finally, I'll examine the income statement:\n   - There is a \"Tax Expense\" line item with an amount of 299,588.25\n\nAll three financial statements consistently show the same tax amount. The \"Tax Expense\" line in the income statement specifically represents the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period.\n\nTherefore, the value I need to extract is 299,588.25.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '299588.25'} }\n```",
