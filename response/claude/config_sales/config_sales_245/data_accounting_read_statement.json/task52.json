This is typically represented by accounts like \"Paid-in Capital\", \"Share Capital\", or \"Common Stock\".\n\nFrom the balance sheet, I can see:\n- \"Paid-in Capital\" with an Initial_amount of 13000000.00 on 2023-12-31\n- \"Paid-in Capital\" with an End_amount of 13000000.00 on 2024-01-29\n\nThis line item represents the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares. The values remained the same between the initial and end dates, which means there were no additional capital contributions or withdrawals during this period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
