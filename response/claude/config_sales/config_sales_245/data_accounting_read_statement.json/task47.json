Beginning Balance: 8000000.00\n2. Ending Balance: 8215423.24\n\nThe net increase is the difference between the ending balance and beginning balance: 8215423.24 - 8000000.00 = 215423.24\n\nTherefore, the value for the net addition in cash and cash equivalents is 215423.24, and the two component sub-items are the Beginning Balance (8000000.00) and the Ending Balance (8215423.24).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '215423.24', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_item value2': '8215423.24'}}}\n```",
