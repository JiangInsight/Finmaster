These are the liabilities that will be paid off within one year or within the normal operating cycle of the business.\n\nIn the balance sheet, \"Total Current Liabilities\" represents exactly what I'm looking for - the sum of all liabilities expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle.\n\nThe values for Total Current Liabilities are:\n- Initial amount (2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End amount (2024-01-29): 1124588.25\n\nTherefore, my solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1124588.25'}}\n```",
