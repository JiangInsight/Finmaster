Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement to find these values:\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet\n- For capital contributed by shareholders: \"Paid-in Capital\" = 13000000.00\n\n### 2. Income Statement\n- For profit or loss before tax: \"Profit Before Tax\" = 1463131.32\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n- For addition in accounts payable (amount owed for goods/services): \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" = 825000.00\n\nThese three values match the required line items, so my solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1463131.32', 'value3': '825000.00'}}\n```",
