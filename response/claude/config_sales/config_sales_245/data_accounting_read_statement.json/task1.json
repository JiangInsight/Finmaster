Cash on Hand: Initial 3,000,000.00 (2023-12-31), End 4,560,423.24 (2024-01-29)\n2. Bank Deposits: Initial 5,000,000.00 (2023-12-31), End 3,655,000.00 (2024-01-29)\n\nBoth of these are liquid assets that would be available for the entity's day-to-day operations. While \"Cash on Hand\" represents physical currency and readily available funds, \"Bank Deposits\" are funds held in bank accounts that are also generally available for operational use.\n\nSince the task asks to identify the specific line items for cash available for day-to-day operations, I should include only the \"Cash on Hand\" value, as this most directly represents immediately available cash.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '3000000.00', 'end value': '4560423.24'} }\n```",
