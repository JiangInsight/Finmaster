Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit - this would be Accounts Receivable on the Balance Sheet\n2. Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds - this would be Financial Expenses on the Income Statement\n3. Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment - this would be Purchase of Fixed Assets on the Cash Flow Statement\n\nLet me find these values in the provided financial statements:\n\n1. From the Balance Sheet: \"Accounts Receivable\" with End_amount = 1133414.13\n2. From the Income Statement: \"Financial Expenses\" with Amount = 190559.73\n3. From the Cash Flow Statement: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with Amount = 0.00\n\nTherefore, the three values I need to extract are:\n- value1: 1133414.13\n- value2: 190559.73\n- value3: 0.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1133414.13', 'value2': '190559.73', 'value3': '0.00'}}\n```",
