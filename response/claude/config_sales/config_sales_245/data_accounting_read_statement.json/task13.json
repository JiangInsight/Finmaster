These are typically non-current (or long-term) assets.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet provided:\n\n1. Current assets include: Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, Accounts Receivable, and Inventory. These are all assets expected to be realized within the normal operating cycle.\n\n2. Non-current assets are shown as \"Total Non-current Assets\" which consists of Fixed Assets less Accumulated Depreciation. These are assets not expected to be realized in the normal operating cycle.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial value of Total Non-current Assets: 5000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- End value of Total Non-current Assets: 4954242.29 (as of 2024-01-29)\n\nTherefore, the values I need to extract are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '4954242.29'}}\n```",
