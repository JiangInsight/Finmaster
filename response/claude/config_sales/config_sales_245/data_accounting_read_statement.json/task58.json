In the balance sheet, I can see that as of the initial date (2023-12-31), there are two cash-related accounts:\n   - Cash on Hand: 3000000.00\n   - Bank Deposits: 5000000.00\n\n2. In the cash flow statement, there's a direct line item:\n   - \"Beginning Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section: 8000000.00\n\nBoth sources confirm that the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period was 8,000,000.00, which is the sum of Cash on Hand and Bank Deposits from the initial balance sheet.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
