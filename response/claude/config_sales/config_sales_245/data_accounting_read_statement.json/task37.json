Under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" there is a line item explicitly labeled \"Depreciation\"\n2. The value for this item is 45757.71\n3. This represents the systematic allocation of assets' depreciable amounts over their useful lives for the reporting period\n\nTherefore, the value I need to extract is 45757.71.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45757.71'} }\n```",
