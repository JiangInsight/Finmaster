                        "content": "I'll solve this step-by-step by calculating each of the required financial ratios.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis ratio measures the ability of a company to pay its current liabilities from its operating cash flow.\n- Operating Cash Flow = $215,423.24\n- Current Liabilities = $1,124,588.25\n- Ratio = $215,423.24 ÷ $1,124,588.25 = 0.19\n\n## 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio measures the proportion of debt to equity.\n- Total Liabilities = $1,124,588.25\n- Total Equity = $14,163,543.07\n- Ratio = $1,124,588.25 ÷ $14,163,543.07 = 0.08\n\n## 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n- Revenue = $5,991,764.34\n- Total Assets = $15,288,131.32\n- Ratio = $5,991,764.34 ÷ $15,288,131.32 = 0.39\n\n## 4. Quick Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n- (Current Assets - Inventory) = $10,333,889.03 - $975,000 = $9,358,889.03\n- Current Liabilities = $1,124,588.25\n- Ratio = $9,358,889.03 ÷ $1,124,588.25 = 8.32\n\n## 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis is the same as Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n- Ratio = 0.19\n\n## 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\nThis ratio measures the profitability relative to shareholders' equity.\n- Net Profit = $1,163,543.07\n- Total Equity = $14,163,543.07\n- ROE = ($1,163,543.07 ÷ $14,163,543.07) × 100% = 8.22%\n\n## 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company collects on its credit sales.\n- Revenue = $5,991,764.34\n- Average Accounts Receivable = ($0 + $1,133,414.13) ÷ 2 = $566,707.07\n- Ratio = $5,991,764.34 ÷ $566,707.07 = 10.57\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.19', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.08', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.39', 'Quick Ratio': '8.32', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.19', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '8.22%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '10.57'} }\n```",
