Operating Cash Flow: This is the \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" from the cash flow statement, which is $215,423.24.\n\n2. Current Liabilities: This is the \"Total Current Liabilities\" from the balance sheet's end amounts, which is $1,124,588.25.\n\nNow I'll calculate the ratio:\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n= $215,423.24 / $1,124,588.25\n= 0.1915 or approximately 0.19\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: 0.19\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.19'} }\n```",
