Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay off short-term liabilities with operating cash flow.\nFormula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities ÷ Total Current Liabilities\n= $215,423.24 ÷ $1,124,588.25\n= 0.19\n\n## 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to cover its debt with operating cash flow.\nFormula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities ÷ Total Liabilities\n= $215,423.24 ÷ $1,124,588.25\n= 0.19\n\n## 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period.\nFormula: Cost of Goods Sold ÷ Average Inventory\nSince we only have ending inventory, I'll use that:\n= $3,250,000.00 ÷ $975,000.00\n= 3.33\n\n## 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's financial leverage by comparing total liabilities to shareholders' equity.\nFormula: Total Liabilities ÷ Total Owner's Equity\n= $1,124,588.25 ÷ $14,163,543.07\n= 0.08\n\n## 5. Quick Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\nFormula: (Current Assets - Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities\n= ($10,333,889.03 - $975,000.00) ÷ $1,124,588.25\n= $9,358,889.03 ÷ $1,124,588.25\n= 8.32\n\n## 6. Current Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations.\nFormula: Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities\n= $10,333,889.03 ÷ $1,124,588.25\n= 9.19\n\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.19', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.19', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '3.33', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.08', 'Quick Ratio': '8.32', 'Current Ratio': '9.19'}}",
