This ratio measures the portion of a company's assets that are financed by debt.\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nStep 1: Identify the Total Liabilities at the end of the reporting period.\nFrom the balance sheet, I can see that \"Total Current Liabilities\" is $1,124,588.25. There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so this represents the total liabilities.\n\nStep 2: Identify the Total Assets at the end of the reporting period.\nFrom the balance sheet, I can see that \"Total Assets\" is $15,288,131.32.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio.\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $1,124,588.25 / $15,288,131.32 = 0.073559 â‰ˆ 0.07\n\nTherefore, the Debt to Asset Ratio is 0.07, which means that approximately 7% of the company's assets are financed by debt.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.07'} }\n```",
