From the cash flow statement, I can see that the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is $215,423.24\n\n2. From the balance sheet, I need to identify the total debt:\n   - Total Current Liabilities: $1,124,588.25\n   - I don't see any long-term debt or non-current liabilities in the balance sheet\n   - So Total Debt = $1,124,588.25\n\n3. Now I can calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:\n   Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n   Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = $215,423.24 / $1,124,588.25\n   Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = 0.1915 â‰ˆ 0.19\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is 0.19.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.19'} }\n```",
