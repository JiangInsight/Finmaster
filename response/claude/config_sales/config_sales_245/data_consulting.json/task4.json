The Debt to Equity Ratio is calculated by dividing the total liabilities by the total shareholders' equity.\n\nFrom the balance sheet provided:\n\n1. Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $1,124,588.25\n   (Since there are no non-current liabilities mentioned)\n\n2. Total Owner's Equity = $14,163,543.07\n\n3. Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n   = $1,124,588.25 / $14,163,543.07\n   = 0.0794 (rounded to two decimal places = 0.08)\n\nTherefore, the Debt to Equity Ratio is 0.08.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.08'}}\n```",
