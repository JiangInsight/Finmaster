                        "content": "I need to calculate the Return on Equity (ROE) for this company based on the financial statements provided.\n\nROE measures how efficiently a company uses its equity to generate profits. The formula for ROE is:\n\nROE = Net Profit / Average Shareholders' Equity × 100%\n\nLet's gather the necessary information:\n\n1. Net Profit (from income statement): $1,163,543.07\n2. Initial Shareholders' Equity (from balance sheet): $13,000,000.00\n3. Ending Shareholders' Equity (from balance sheet): $14,163,543.07\n\nThe average shareholders' equity is:\nAverage Shareholders' Equity = (Initial + Ending)/2\nAverage Shareholders' Equity = ($13,000,000.00 + $14,163,543.07)/2\nAverage Shareholders' Equity = $13,581,771.54\n\nNow I can calculate the ROE:\nROE = $1,163,543.07 / $13,581,771.54 × 100%\nROE = 0.0857 × 100%\nROE = 8.57%\n\nTherefore, the Return on Equity (ROE) for this company is 8.57%.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '8.57%'}}\n```",
