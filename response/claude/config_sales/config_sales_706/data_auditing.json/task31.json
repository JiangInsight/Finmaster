The cost amount for this transaction was $10000.00, with a tax amount of $994.61, leading to a total amount due of $18897.65.\"\n\nLet's check if the numbers match:\n- Invoice states 1.0 units but record shows 0.0 units\n- Invoice states unit price of $19892.26 but record shows $20540.73\n- Invoice states total amount of $19892.26 but record shows $0.0\n- Invoice states tax amount of $994.61 (5% of amount) but record shows $21281.43\n- Invoice states after-tax amount of $18897.65 but this doesn't match the typical calculation\n\nBased on the invoice, the correct values should be:\n- Quantity: 1.0\n- Unit price: $19892.26\n- Total amount: $19892.26\n- Tax amount: $994.61\n- After-tax amount: $18897.65 (though this seems to be the amount minus tax, not plus tax as would be expected)\n\nThe profit calculation also needs verification: $10000 cost with $19892.26 total would suggest a profit of $9892.26, which matches the recorded profit of $9892.26.\n\nTherefore, there are multiple inconsistencies in this transaction.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"0.0\", \"Original price\": \"19892.26\", \"Recorded price\": \"20540.73\", \"Original amount\": \"19892.26\", \"Recorded amount\": \"0.0\", \"Original tax\": \"994.61\", \"Recorded tax\": \"21281.43\", \"id\": \"Sale20240109025\"}}\n```",
