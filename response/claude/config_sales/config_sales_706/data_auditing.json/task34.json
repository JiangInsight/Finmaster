The transaction ID starts with \"Sale\" but the recorded_type is \"Purchase\" - this is inconsistent.\n2. The date in the invoice says January 14, 2024, but the recorded_date is January 30, 2024.\n3. The invoice states 3.0 units, but recorded_quantity is 2.0.\n4. The invoice states a unit price of $39137.67, but recorded_unit_price is $32393.56.\n5. The invoice mentions a tax amount of $5870.65, but recorded_tax_amount is $130977.9.\n6. The invoice states a total of $117413.01, which would be correct for 3 units at $39137.67, but recorded_amount is $78275.34.\n\nThe invoice description appears to be the most reliable source here, and it clearly indicates this is a Sale transaction (consistent with the ID prefix), not a Purchase.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Purchase\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-14\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-30\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"3.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"2.0\", \"Original price\": \"39137.67\", \"Recorded price\": \"32393.56\", \"Original receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original amount\": \"117413.01\", \"Recorded amount\": \"78275.34\", \"Original tax\": \"5870.65\", \"Recorded tax\": \"130977.9\", \"Original profit\": \"57413.01\", \"Recorded profit\": \"57413.01\", \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240114047\"}}\n```",
