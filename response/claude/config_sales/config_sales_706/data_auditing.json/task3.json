This is an inconsistency between the recorded field and the more reliable invoice information.\n\nSimilarly, there's another inconsistency in the Interest20240121021 transaction where the recorded_payment/receipt_status is shown as \"Unpaid\" in the invoice description, but the recorded field shows it as \"Paid\".\n\nBased on my analysis:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240128001'} }\n```",
