Transaction ID: Purchase20231231017\n   - The recorded_preparer field is empty (None)\n   - However, the invoice clearly states: \"This transaction was prepared by Supervisor, and the approver is Director.\"\n\n2. Transaction ID: Expense20240125001 (the 4th one with this ID)\n   - The recorded_preparer field is empty (None)\n   - However, the invoice states: \"This transaction was prepared by Staff, and the approver is Director.\"\n\nSince the invoice details are considered more reliable based on your instructions, these represent clear inconsistencies that need correction.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": [\n  {\n    \"Original Preparer\": \"Supervisor\",\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": \"None\",\n    \"id\": \"Purchase20231231017\",\n    \"Original category\": null,\n    \"Recorded category\": null,\n    \"Original date\": null,\n    \"Recorded date\": null,\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Original payment_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n    \"Original quantity\": null,\n    \"Recorded quantity\": null,\n    \"Original price\": null,\n    \"Recorded price\": null,\n    \"Original receive_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": null,\n    \"Original amount\": null,\n    \"Recorded amount\": null,\n    \"Original tax\": null,\n    \"Recorded tax\": null,\n    \"Original profit\": null,\n    \"Recorded profit\": null,\n    \"Original Approver\": null,\n    \"Recorded Approver\": null\n  },\n  {\n    \"Original Preparer\": \"Staff\",\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": \"None\",\n    \"id\": \"Expense20240125001\",\n    \"Original category\": null,\n    \"Recorded category\": null,\n    \"Original date\": null,\n    \"Recorded date\": null,\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Original payment_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n    \"Original quantity\": null,\n    \"Recorded quantity\": null,\n    \"Original price\": null,\n    \"Recorded price\": null,\n    \"Original receive_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": null,\n    \"Original amount\": null,\n    \"Recorded amount\": null,\n    \"Original tax\": null,\n    \"Recorded tax\": null,\n    \"Original profit\": null,\n    \"Recorded profit\": null,\n    \"Original Approver\": null,\n    \"Recorded Approver\": null\n  }\n]}\n```\n\nActually, let me correct my answer format to match exactly what was requested:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original Preparer': 'Supervisor', 'Recorded Preparer': 'None', 'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Purchase20231231017'} }",
