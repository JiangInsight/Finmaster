Also, there's an inconsistency in the spelling of the receive method.\n\nLooking at transaction ID Purchase20231231001:\n- The invoice says \"consisting of 9.0 units at a unit price of $20000.00, totaling $180000.00\"\n- The recorded amount is correctly $180000.0\n- This checks out mathematically (9 × $20000 = $180000)\n\nFor each Interest Receivables entry, I'll compare the patterns to check for any other inconsistencies.\n\nThe entry Purchase20231231001 and other Purchase transactions seem to be consistent.\n\nFor sales transactions like Sale20240102003, the recorded amounts match the unit price × quantity calculations from the invoice descriptions.\n\nI notice that all the Interest Receivables transactions follow a similar pattern except Interest20240103003, which has the incorrect category recorded.\n\nBased on my analysis, I found the following inconsistencies:\n\n1. Interest20240103003 has \"Depreciation\" recorded as its type, but the invoice indicates it's \"Interest Receivables\"\n2. Interest20240103003 has \"Interest receivable\" as the receive_method, but other similar transactions use \"Interest receviable\"\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Interest Receivables\", \"Recorded category\": \"Depreciation\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": \"Interest receviable\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Interest receivable\", \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Interest20240103003\"}}\n```",
