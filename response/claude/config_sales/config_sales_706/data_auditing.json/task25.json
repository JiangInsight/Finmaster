Category mismatch: Should be \"Sale\" not \"Sales Expenses\"\n2. Date mismatch: Should be \"2024-01-02\" not \"2024-01-31\"\n3. Unit price mismatch: Should be 39394.90 not 39206.62\n\nLooking at the other fields, they appear consistent with the invoice information, so I'll focus on these three discrepancies.\n\nThe transaction ID \"Sale20240102003\" itself suggests it should be a Sale transaction that occurred on January 2, 2024 (20240102).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-02\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-31\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Original price\": \"39394.90\", \"Recorded price\": \"39206.62\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": \"39394.9\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": \"1969.75\", \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": \"19394.9\", \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240102003\"}}\n```",
