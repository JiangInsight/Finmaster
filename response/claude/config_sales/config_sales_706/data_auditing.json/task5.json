The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $1934.70, leading to a total amount due of $36759.23. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\nThis clearly shows the original quantity is 1.0 and the original amount is $38693.93, not 0.0 as recorded.\n\n## Transaction ID: Sale20240103006\nNo obvious discrepancies between recorded fields and the invoice description.\n\n## Other transactions\nI don't see any obvious inconsistencies in the other transactions when comparing the recorded fields with their invoice descriptions.\n\nBased on my analysis, the only clear inconsistency is in Sale20240128110, where the recorded quantity and amount are incorrectly set to 0 instead of the values described in the invoice.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '1.0', 'Recorded quantity': '0.0', 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '38693.93', 'Recorded amount': '0.0', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240128110'} }",
