The recorded category is \"Sale\" but the invoice indicates it should be \"Interest Receivables\"\n2. The recorded date is \"2024-02-03\" but the invoice states \"January 22, 2024\"\n3. The recorded amount is \"431.95\" but the invoice shows \"366.23\"\n\nThe invoice description explicitly states: \"On January 22, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Interest Receivables, totaling $366.23. The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nThis clear mismatch between the recorded information and the invoice description indicates internal inconsistencies in this transaction.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Interest Receivables', 'Recorded category': 'Sale', 'Original date': '2024-01-22', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-03', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '366.23', 'Recorded amount': '431.95', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Interest20240122022'} }\n```",
