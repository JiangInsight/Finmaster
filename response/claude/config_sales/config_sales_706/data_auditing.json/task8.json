I'll compare the recorded information with what's stated in the invoice, which is generally more reliable as it's a standardized, regulated document.\n\nLet me go through the data systematically:\n\n## Transaction: Sale20240110016\nLooking at the invoice: \"On January 10, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $62344.08, totaling $124688.16. The cost amount for this transaction was $100000.00, with a tax amount of $6234.41, leading to a total amount due of $118453.75. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nBut the recorded_amount is $138369.24, which doesn't match the invoice total of $124688.16.\n\n## Transaction: Expense20240112001\nLooking at the invoice: \"On January 12, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sales Expenses, totaling $16177.79.
