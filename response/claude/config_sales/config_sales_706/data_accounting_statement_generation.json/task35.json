                        "content": "I'll solve this task by analyzing the transaction data to generate a complete income statement.\n\n## Step 1: Categorize all transactions by type\nFirst, I need to identify all revenue and expense transactions:\n\n### Revenue:\n- Sales transactions (type: \"Sale\")\n- Interest income (type: \"Interest Receivables\")\n\n### Expenses:\n- Cost of goods sold (from sales transactions)\n- Administrative expenses (type: \"Administrative Expenses\")\n- Sales expenses (type: \"Sales Expenses\")\n- Depreciation (type: \"Depreciation\")\n- Financial expenses (type: \"Financial Expenses\")\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Main Business Revenue\nThis includes all sales transactions. I'll sum up the \"amount\" field for all sales transactions.\n\nTotal from all sales (rows with type \"Sale\"): \n= 38,148.42 + 39,394.90 + 17,983.04 + 9,073.85 + 90,340.71 + ... (all sale transactions)\n= 5,642,791.10\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Cost of Goods Sold\nFrom the sales transactions, I can find the cost of goods sold in the \"cost_amount\" field.\n\nTotal COGS: \n= 20,000 + 20,000 + 10,000 + 5,000 + 50,000 + ... (cost_amount from all sales)\n= 3,100,000.00\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Gross Profit\nGross Profit = Main Business Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold\n= 5,642,791.10 - 3,100,000.00 = 2,542,791.10\n\n## Step 5: Calculate Operating Expenses\n\n### Administrative Expenses\nSum of all transactions with type \"Administrative Expenses\":\n= 13,598.33 + 11,440.73 + 17,441.50 + 16,376.52 + ... (all administrative expense transactions)\n= 177,452.14\n\n### Sales Expenses\nSum of all transactions with type \"Sales Expenses\":\n= 27,754.04 + 6,461.03 + 6,031.59 + 27,436.74 + ... (all sales expense transactions)\n= 655,778.47\n\n### Depreciation\nSum of all transactions with type \"Depreciation\":\n= 45,749.76\n\n### Financial Expenses\nSum of all transactions with type \"Financial Expenses\":\n= 18,889.24 + 29,563.21 + 3,450.52 + 7,166.40 + ... (all financial expense transactions)\n= 297,783.53\n\n### Total Operating Expenses\n= 177,452.14 + 655,778.47 + 45,749.76 + 297,783.53 = 1,176,763.90\n\n## Step 6: Calculate Interest Income\nSum of all transactions with type \"Interest Receivables\":\n= 445.00 + 441.44 + 441.44 + 437.44 + ... (all interest income transactions)\n= 9,867.45\n\n## Step 7: Calculate Profit Before Tax\nProfit Before Tax = Gross Profit - Total Operating Expenses + Interest Income\n= 2,542,791.10 - 1,176,763.90 + 9,867.45 = 1,375,894.65\n\n## Step 8: Calculate Tax Expense\nLooking at the sales transactions, the tax amounts are provided.\nSum of all \"tax_amount\" fields from sales transactions:\n= 1,907.42 + 1,969.75 + 899.15 + 453.69 + ... (all tax amounts)\n= 282,139.56\n\n## Step 9: Calculate Net Profit\nNet Profit = Profit Before Tax - Tax Expense\n= 1,375,894.65 - 282,139.56 = 1,093,755.09\n\n## Final Income Statement\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Main Business Revenue': '5642791.10', 'Total Revenue': '5642791.10', 'Cost of Goods Sold': '3100000.00', 'Total Cost': '3100000.00', 'Gross Profit': '2542791.10', 'Administrative Expenses': '177452.14', 'Selling Expenses': '655778.47', 'Depreciation': '45749.76', 'Financial Expenses': '297783.53', 'Total Expenses': '1176763.90', 'Interest Income': '9867.45', 'Profit Before Tax': '1375894.65', 'Tax Expense': '282139.56', 'Net Profit': '1093755.09'} }\n```",
