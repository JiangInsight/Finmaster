Let me work through this step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Calculate the net profit\nFirst, I need to determine revenues, costs, and expenses to calculate net profit.\n\n**Revenues (Sales):**\n- Total sales from the transactions (both cash and account receivable)\n- Sum of all sale transaction amounts: 5,506,118.56\n\n**Costs:**\n- Cost of goods sold: 3,160,000.00 (sum of all \"cost_amount\" in sales transactions)\n\n**Expenses:**\n- Sales Expenses: 489,947.11\n- Administrative Expenses: 212,233.05\n- Financial Expenses: 247,427.47\n- Depreciation: 45,749.76\n- Total Expenses: 995,357.39\n\n**Net Profit Calculation:**\n- Revenue (5,506,118.56) - COGS (3,160,000.00) - Expenses (995,357.39) = 1,350,761.17\n\n## Step 2: Analyze changes in working capital accounts\n\n**Accounts Receivable:**\n- Initial: 0.00\n- Ending: 1,261,272.16 (sum of all unpaid sales)\n- Change in AR: -1,261,272.16 (increase is negative for cash flow)\n\n**Interest Receivable:**\n- Initial: 0.00\n- Ending: 9,766.55 (sum of all unpaid interest)\n- Change in IR: -9,766.55 (increase is negative for cash flow)\n\n**Inventory:**\n- Initial: 0.00\n- Ending: 2,165,000.00 (sum of all purchases)\n- Change in Inventory: -2,165,000.00 (increase is negative for cash flow)\n\n**Accounts Payable:**\n- Initial: 0.00\n- Ending: 1,520,000.00 (sum of all unpaid purchases)\n- Change in AP: 1,520,000.00 (increase is positive for cash flow)\n\n**Tax Payable:**\n- Initial: 0.00\n- Ending: 211,280.80 (sum of all tax amounts from sales)\n- Change in Tax Payable: 211,280.80 (increase is positive for cash flow)\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Operating Cash Flow\n- Net Profit: 1,350,761.17\n- Add: Depreciation: 45,749.76\n- Add/Subtract: Changes in Working Capital:\n  - Accounts Receivable: -1,261,272.16\n  - Interest Receivable: -9,766.55\n  - Inventory: -2,165,000.00\n  - Accounts Payable: 1,520,000.00\n  - Tax Payable: 211,280.80\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -308,246.98\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Investing Cash Flow\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 352,857.55\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -352,857.55\n\n## Step 5: Calculate beginning and ending cash balances\n- Beginning Balance (Cash + Bank deposit): 8,000,000.00\n- Cash Outflows: Operating (-308,246.98) + Investing (-352,857.55) = -661,104.53\n- Ending Balance: 7,338,895.47\n- Net Change in Cash: -661,104.53\n\nNow I'll format the solution according to the requested JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Net Profit\": \"1,350,761.17\", \"Depreciation\": \"45,749.76\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-1,261,272.16\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-9,766.55\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-2,165,000.00\", \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"1,520,000.00\", \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"211,280.80\", \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-308,246.98\", \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"352,857.55\", \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-352,857.55\", \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": \"0.00\", \"Beginning Balance\": \"8,000,000.00\", \"Ending Balance\": \"7,338,895.47\", \"Net Increase\": \"-661,104.53\"}}\n```\n\nLet me verify that all calculations are correct before submitting my final answer.\n\nFor the final solution, I'll remove the commas to match the format in the example:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow From Operating Activities': '0.00', 'Net Profit': '1350761.17', 'Depreciation': '45749.76', '(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-1261272.16', '(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-9766.55', '(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-2165000.00', 'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '1520000.00', 'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '211280.80', 'Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities': '-308246.98', 'Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '0.00', 'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '352857.55', 'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-352857.55', 'Cash and Cash Equivalents': '0.00', 'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00', 'Ending Balance': '7338895.47', 'Net Increase': '-661104.53'} }",
