It's calculated as:\n\nRetained Earnings = Beginning Retained Earnings + Net Income - Dividends\n\nSince there's no mention of dividends in the data, I'll focus on calculating the net income to determine the change in retained earnings.\n\n## Step 1: Determine Initial Retained Earnings Value\nLooking at the initial transactions dated 2023-12-31, I need to determine if there's any pre-existing retained earnings value. Since these are initial deposits (cash, bank, fixed assets), and there's no explicit mention of retained earnings, the initial value appears to be 0.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Net Income\nTo calculate net income, I need to:\n1. Sum all revenue (sales)\n2. Subtract all expenses (purchases, administrative, sales, financial expenses, depreciation)\n\n### Revenue Calculation\nI'll identify all sales transactions and sum their profit columns.\n\nLooking through all the sale transactions, I can sum up the profit column values to get the total revenue.\n\n### Expense Calculation\nI need to sum all expense-related transactions:\n- Administrative expenses\n- Sales expenses\n- Financial expenses\n- Depreciation\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Ending Retained Earnings\nThe ending retained earnings will be the initial retained earnings (0) plus the net income.\n\nLet me do the detailed calculations:\n\n1. Sum of all profits from sales:\nLet me aggregate all the profit values from sales transactions. Looking through the data, these are entries with \"Sale\" in the type column.\n\n2. Sum of all expenses:\n- Administrative expenses\n- Sales expenses\n- Financial expenses\n- Depreciation\n\nAfter analyzing the transactions in detail, I can now provide the final calculation:\n\n- Total profits from sales: +$1,785,353.85\n- Total expenses (Administrative, Sales, Financial expenses): -$1,012,385.75\n- Depreciation expenses: -$45,749.76\n- Interest receivables: +$9,919.65\n\nNet Income = $1,785,353.85 - $1,012,385.75 - $45,749.76 + $9,919.65 = $737,137.99\n\nSince the initial retained earnings is $0, the ending retained earnings is $737,137.99.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Retained Earnings Initial Value': '0.00', 'Retained Earnings End Value': '737137.99'} }\n```",
