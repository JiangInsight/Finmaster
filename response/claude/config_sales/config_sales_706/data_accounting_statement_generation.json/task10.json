                        "content": "I'll solve this step by step to calculate the property, plant, and non-current assets items for the balance sheet.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all transactions related to fixed assets including:\n1. Initial fixed assets values\n2. Any fixed asset purchases\n3. Depreciation \n\n## Step 1: Identify the initial fixed asset value\nFrom the data, I can see that there's an initial fixed assets entry on 2023-12-31:\n```\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0 |\n```\nSo the initial value is 5,000,000.00.\n\n## Step 2: Identify any additional fixed asset purchases\nLooking through the transactions, I found one fixed asset purchase:\n```\n| FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 352857.55 | 352857.55 |  |  | Paid |  | Bank Transfer | S002 | Supplier 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Processing Equipment4 | Processing Equipment |\n```\nThis is a purchase of Processing Equipment for 352,857.55.\n\n## Step 3: Account for depreciation\nThere is a depreciation entry on 2024-01-01:\n```\n| Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45749.759999999995 | 45749.759999999995 |\n```\nThe depreciation amount is 45,749.76.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final fixed asset value\nInitial value + Additional purchases - Depreciation\n= 5,000,000.00 + 352,857.55 - 45,749.76\n= 5,307,107.79\n\nHowever, I need to check if there are any other fixed asset-related entries that I might have missed.\n\nAfter reviewing the data again, I don't see any other entries that would affect fixed assets (no sales or disposals of fixed assets, no additional depreciation entries, etc.).\n\nTherefore:\n- Total Non-current Assets Initial Value: 5,000,000.00\n- Total Non-current Assets End Value: 5,307,107.79\n\nBut let me double-check with more precision. The exact calculation would be:\n5,000,000 + 352,857.55 - 45,749.76 = 5,307,107.79\n\nTo be fully precise:\n5,000,000.00 + 352,857.55 - 45,749.76 = 5,307,107.79\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '5307107.79'}}",
