The amount is 45749.76 (rounding slightly from 45749.759999999995).\n\nSince this is the only depreciation transaction in the data, this is the final depreciation item that would appear in the cash flow statement.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45749.76'} }\n```\n\nActually, let me double-check that value. The original value is 45749.759999999995, which rounds to 45749.76. However, I notice that many of the financial values in the example seem to be using exact decimal representation. Let me provide the exact value as recorded in the data:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45749.76'} }\n```",
