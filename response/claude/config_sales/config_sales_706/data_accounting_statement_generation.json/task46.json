These are typically recorded at the start of the period.\n\nFrom the data, I can see:\n- Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | 3000000.0\n- Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0\n\nThese represent the company's initial cash and bank balances as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the beginning balance\nThe beginning cash and cash equivalents balance is the sum of the initial cash and bank deposits:\n- Cash: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank: 5,000,000.00\n- Total beginning balance: 8,000,000.00\n\nThis represents the amount of cash and cash equivalents available at the beginning of the period (January 1, 2024) for the cash flow statement.\n\n## Step 3: Verify this is the correct figure\n- These deposits are dated 2023-12-31, which confirms they represent the balances at the end of the previous period, making them the beginning balances for the current period.\n- The type descriptions \"Cash deposit\" and \"Bank deposit\" indicate these are indeed the initial cash and bank balances.\n- Fixed Assets (also listed with the same ID) is not included in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nTherefore, the beginning cash and cash equivalents balance for the cash flow statement is $8,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
