First, identify initial cash balances:\n   - Initial cash deposit: $3,000,000\n   - Initial bank deposit: $5,000,000\n   - Total initial cash and equivalents: $8,000,000\n\n2. Now I'll track all cash movements:\n   - Cash inflows (sales with cash payments)\n   - Cash outflows (purchases, expenses with cash payments)\n   - Transfers between cash and bank\n\nLet me go through all transactions methodically:\n\n### Initial Balances:\n- Cash: $3,000,000.00\n- Bank: $5,000,000.00\n- Total: $8,000,000.00\n\n### Cash Outflows:\n- Purchase payments made in cash: $30,000.00 + $80,000.00 + $160,000.00 + $350,000.00 = $620,000.00\n- Cash expense payments: $27,754.04 + $6,461.03 + $6,031.59 + $18,889.24 + $13,598.33 + $29,563.21 + $27,436.74 + $17,413.76 + $11,853.48 + $11,440.73 + $17,319.80 + $13,385.96 + $3,450.52 + $17,441.50 + $7,166.40 + $15,181.71 + $29,279.52 + $13,430.69 + $16,376.52 + $11,170.75 + $3,796.88 + $28,353.60 + $8,332.03 + $5,017.73 + $12,391.14 + $18,972.61 + $25,408.23 + $11,888.13 + $22,411.89 + $21,229.14 + $24,321.46 + $9,797.60 + $16,177.79 + $25,170.68 + $25,847.64 + $5,806.03 + $19,807.67 + $29,829.23 + $6,448.24 + $29,376.50 + $14,371.43 + $9,539.83 + $23,251.04 + $16,740.11 + $17,890.86 + $20,377.67 + $12,516.13 + $10,393.45 + $6,653.08 + $11,523.39 + $7,597.54 + $16,665.55 + $6,944.55 + $28,954.07 + $4,951.13 + $22,862.32 + $4,649.17 + $28,930.22 + $20,209.44 + $7,920.03 + $15,038.02 + $28,414.41 + $14,013.88 + $8,149.08 + $22,205.08 + $21,106.73 + $7,005.37 + $19,525.10 + $22,565.02 + $21,535.55 + $15,913.30 + $27,817.09 + $21,561.32 + $6,698.63 = $1,235,092.36\n\n### Cash Inflows:\n- Cash sales: $39,394.90 + $38,148.42 + $90,340.71 + $9,073.85 + $26,562.30 + $26,388.51 + $38,436.94 + $36,168.09 + $173,165.24 + $98,199.15 + $18,699.29 + $19,892.26 + $174,585.20 + $196,067.34 + $17,185.29 + $113,181.93 + $90,831.99 + $36,413.56 + $56,856.45 + $117,413.01 + $294,287.22 + $19,890.08 + $18,612.68 + $36,238.80 + $176,278.96 + $74,434.04 + $37,660.74 + $29,785.86 + $34,617.14 + $36,143.32 + $261,490.35 + $177,778.96 + $88,341.49 + $39,109.78 + $35,569.85 + $105,626.73 + $173,347.72 + $76,538.96 + $266,310.81 + $36,921.82 + $8,648.77 + $86,533.38 + $19,338.67 + $286,885.38 + $295,661.79 + $98,343.59 + $38,693.93 + $51,298.56 = $3,991,045.85\n\n### Bank Transfers (Cash to Bank):\nThere are no explicit transfers from bank to cash, but there are transfers from cash to bank:\n- Amount: $0.00\n\n### Total Movement Calculation:\n- Initial Cash Balance: $3,000,000.00\n- Initial Bank Balance: $5,000,000.00\n- Total Initial Balance: $8,000,000.00\n- Cash Outflows: -$1,855,092.36\n- Cash Inflows: +$3,991,045.85\n- Net Change: $2,135,953.49\n\n### Final Balance:\n$8,000,000.00 + $2,135,953.49 = $10,135,953.49\n\n### Verification:\nLet me verify this by an alternative method - tracing the actual cash balance changes:\n- Initial cash and bank deposits: $8,000,000.00\n- Add: Cash sales receipts: $3,991,045.85\n- Less: Cash payments for expenses and purchases: $1,855,092.36\n- Less: Bank transfers (cash to bank): $0.00\n\nEnding Balance: $10,135,953.49\n\nLet me verify with the specific cash items in the transactions table to confirm. Looking at all transactions, it appears the final cash and cash equivalents balance is $10,135,953.49.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Ending Balance': '10135953.49'} }\n```",
