Purchase and sale of fixed assets\n2. Purchase and sale of investments\n3. Loans made to suppliers or received from customers\n4. Any other acquisition or disposal of long-term assets\n\nLet me review the transactions to identify those related to investing activities:\n\nFirst, I'll look for any fixed asset purchases or sales:\n\nI found one transaction labeled as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\":\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 352857.55 | 352857.55 |  |  | Paid |  | Bank Transfer | S002 | Supplier 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Processing Equipment4 | Processing Equipment |\n\nThis represents a cash outflow of 352,857.55 for purchasing processing equipment.\n\nI also notice the initial fixed assets entry, but this appears to be an opening balance rather than a transaction:\n- Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\nI should check for any sales of fixed assets, but I don't see any transactions for disposal of fixed assets in the data.\n\nI don't see any other transactions related to investing activities like purchasing or selling investments, or making long-term loans.\n\nTherefore, the only cash flow from investing activities is the purchase of the processing equipment, which is a cash outflow of 352,857.55.\n\nSince cash outflows are represented as negative values in a cash flow statement, the net cash flow from investing activities is:\n\nNet Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -352,857.55\n\nHowever, I should double-check if there are any other transactions that might be classified as investing activities.\n\nLooking through the data again, I don't see any other transactions related to:\n- Purchase or sale of property, plant, equipment\n- Purchase or sale of investment securities\n- Acquisition or disposal of subsidiaries\n- Loans to or from other entities\n\nTherefore, my calculation is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-352857.55'}}\n```",
