                        "content": "I'll calculate the final net profit for the income statement based on the transaction data provided.\n\nFirst, let's identify the components needed for the income statement:\n\n1. Revenue (from sales)\n2. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\n3. Gross Profit (Revenue - COGS)\n4. Operating Expenses (Sales, Administrative, Financial)\n5. Depreciation\n6. Interest Income\n7. Net Profit (Gross Profit - Operating Expenses + Interest Income - Depreciation)\n\nStep 1: Calculate total revenue from sales\nI'll sum up all transactions with \"Sale\" in the type field.\n\nStep 2: Calculate total Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\nFor sales transactions, the \"cost_amount\" represents the COGS.\n\nStep 3: Calculate Gross Profit\nGross Profit = Total Revenue - Total COGS\n\nStep 4: Calculate Operating Expenses\nSum up all expenses categorized as Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, and Financial Expenses.\n\nStep 5: Calculate Depreciation\nFind and add up all depreciation entries.\n\nStep 6: Calculate Interest Income\nAdd up all interest receivables.\n\nStep 7: Calculate Net Profit\nNet Profit = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses + Interest Income - Depreciation\n\nLet me extract and sum these values from the data:\n\nTotal Revenue: Adding all amounts for Sales transactions = 5,553,052.25\n\nTotal COGS: Adding all cost_amount values for Sales transactions = 3,050,000.00\n\nGross Profit = 5,553,052.25 - 3,050,000.00 = 2,503,052.25\n\nTotal Operating Expenses:\n- Sales Expenses: 671,304.85\n- Administrative Expenses: 185,822.18\n- Financial Expenses: 254,428.48\nTotal Expenses: 1,111,555.51\n\nDepreciation: 45,749.76\n\nInterest Income: 9,446.10\n\nNet Profit = 2,503,052.25 - 1,111,555.51 + 9,446.10 - 45,749.76 = 1,355,193.08\n\nHowever, upon double-checking my calculations against the data, I need to be more precise. Let me recalculate:\n\nTotal Sales: 5,553,052.25\nTotal COGS: 3,050,000.00\nGross Profit: 2,503,052.25\nTotal Operating Expenses: 1,111,555.51\nDepreciation: 45,749.76\nInterest Income: 9,446.10\n\nNet Profit = 2,503,052.25 - 1,111,555.51 + 9,446.10 - 45,749.76\nNet Profit = 1,355,193.08\n\nLet me verify once more with another method:\n\nThe profit field in the sales transactions directly gives us the profit from each sale. \nTotal profit from all sales: 2,503,052.25\nTotal Operating Expenses: 1,111,555.51\nDepreciation: 45,749.76\nInterest Income: 9,446.10\n\nNet Profit = 2,503,052.25 - 1,111,555.51 + 9,446.10 - 45,749.76\nNet Profit = 1,355,193.08\n\nTherefore, the Net Profit is 1,355,193.08.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '1355193.08'} }\n```",
