This would be represented by the \"Taxes Payable\" line item, as it shows taxes that have been recorded as an expense but not yet paid to the tax authorities.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, I can see:\n\n1. The \"Taxes Payable\" line item has:\n   - Initial amount: 0.00 on 2023-12-31\n   - End amount: 290671.05 on 2024-01-28\n\nThis represents the tax liability that the company has accrued but not yet paid as of the reporting dates.\n\nTherefore, the tax accrued but not yet paid is:\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- End value: 290671.05\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '290671.05'} }\n```",
