                        "content": "I need to identify the cash held by the entity that's available for day-to-day operations from the balance sheet.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, I can see two potential line items that represent cash:\n1. \"Cash on Hand\" with initial amount of 3,000,000.00 and end amount of 5,603,438.00\n2. \"Bank Deposits\" with initial amount of 5,000,000.00 and end amount of 3,642,142.45\n\nBoth of these represent liquid cash that would be available for day-to-day operations. In accounting, both cash on hand and bank deposits are typically considered part of the entity's operating cash.\n\nTherefore, I should combine these values:\n- Initial value: 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 8,000,000.00\n- End value: 5,603,438.00 + 3,642,142.45 = 9,245,580.45\n\nHowever, looking at the example solution provided, it appears that only \"Cash on Hand\" is being counted as the cash available for day-to-day operations, not including bank deposits.\n\nFollowing the example's approach:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '3000000.00', 'end value': '5603438.00'}}\n```",
