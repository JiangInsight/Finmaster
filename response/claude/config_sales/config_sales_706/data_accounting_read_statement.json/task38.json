When accounts receivable decreases, it means customers have paid money they owed.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement, I can see the line \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with a value of \"-1355463.34\". \n\nThe negative sign indicates this is an increase in accounts receivable (more is owed to the company), not a decrease. This makes sense because the line item format shows \"(Increase) Decrease\", so a negative value represents an increase.\n\nSince the task asks for the value of the decrease in amounts owed, and we have an increase (not a decrease), the answer is the value shown: -1355463.34.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1355463.34'}}\n```",
