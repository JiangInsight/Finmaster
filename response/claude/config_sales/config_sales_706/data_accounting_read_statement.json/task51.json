This is exactly what I'm looking for.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial value of Interest Receivable (2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End value of Interest Receivable (2024-01-28): 10710.07\n\nThis is confirmed in the cash flow statement, which shows \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" of -10710.07, indicating an increase in interest receivable during the period.\n\nFurther confirmation comes from the income statement, which shows \"Interest Income\" of 10710.07, matching the end value of Interest Receivable.\n\nTherefore, the interest accrued but not yet received is:\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- End value: 10710.07\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '10710.07'}}\n```",
