Looking at the balance sheet provided, I can see a line item called \"Fixed Assets\" which represents these tangible items.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial value of Fixed Assets (as of 2023-12-31): 5000000.00\n- End value of Fixed Assets (as of 2024-01-28): 5352857.55\n\nThese fixed assets are the tangible items we're looking for in this task, as they represent the physical assets used in the business operations.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5352857.55'}}\n```",
