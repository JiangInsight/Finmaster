However, the task is asking specifically for a reduction (decrease) in inventory.\n\nSince the value is negative, it represents an increase in inventory, not a reduction. However, the task specifically asks for the value of the reduction. The value itself is \"-295000.00\", which represents the change in inventory during the period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-295000.00'}}\n```",
