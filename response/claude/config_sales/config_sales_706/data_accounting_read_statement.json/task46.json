This makes sense because the company is spending money to purchase fixed assets.\n\nThe sub-item that contributes to this value is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of 352857.55. Note that the sub-item is positive while the net cash flow is negative because purchasing assets is a cash outflow.\n\nTherefore, my solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-352857.55\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value\": \"352857.55\"}}}\n```",
