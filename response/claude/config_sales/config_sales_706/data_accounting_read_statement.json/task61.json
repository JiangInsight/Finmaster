Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets\n\nLet me examine each financial statement carefully:\n\nFor the first item, I need to look for selling expenses in the income statement since these typically represent costs to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services. Looking at the income statement, I can see:\n- \"Selling Expenses | 731171.32 | 2024-01-28\"\n\nFor the second item, I need to look for cash payments related to acquiring long-term assets in the cash flow statement. Looking at the cash flow statement, I can see:\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets | 352857.55 | 2024-01-28\"\n\nThis represents the cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment.\n\nTherefore, the values I need to extract are:\n- value1: 731171.32 (Selling Expenses)\n- value2: 352857.55 (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '731171.32', 'value2': '352857.55'}}\n```",
