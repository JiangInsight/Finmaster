Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement to find these values:\n\n### Balance Sheet\nLooking at the balance sheet:\n- \"Paid-in Capital\" is capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares: 13000000.00\n- \"Accounts Payable\" shows the amount owed by the entity: 1820000.00\n\n### Income Statement\nFrom the income statement:\n- \"Profit Before Tax\" represents profit before deducting tax expense: 1393861.65\n\n### Cash Flow Statement\nNo additional relevant items needed from here as I already found all three required items.\n\nTherefore, the three values are:\n1. Paid-in Capital: 13000000.00\n2. Profit Before Tax: 1393861.65\n3. Accounts Payable: 1820000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1393861.65', 'value3': '1820000.00'} }\n```",
