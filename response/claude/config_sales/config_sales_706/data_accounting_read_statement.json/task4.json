This is exactly what I'm looking for.\n\nFrom the table:\n- The initial amount for \"Interest Receivable\" as of 2023-12-31 is 0.00\n- The end amount for \"Interest Receivable\" as of 2024-01-28 is 10710.07\n\nTherefore, the interest accrued but not yet received went from 0.00 to 10710.07 during this period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '10710.07'}}\n```",
