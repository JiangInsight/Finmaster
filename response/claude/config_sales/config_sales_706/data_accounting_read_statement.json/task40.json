Accounts payable represents the money a company owes to its suppliers or vendors for goods and services purchased on credit.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement provided:\n- \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is listed with a value of 1820000.00\n\nSince this is a positive number, it represents an increase in accounts payable, meaning the company has added to the amount it owes to suppliers during this period.\n\nTherefore, the value I need to extract is 1820000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1820000.00'}}\n```",
