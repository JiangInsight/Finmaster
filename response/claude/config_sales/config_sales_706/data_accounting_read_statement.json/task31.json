The statement shows \"Total Revenue\" of 5813420.67\n2. \"Total Cost\" of 3175000.00 is deducted\n3. \"Total Expenses\" of 1255269.09 is also deducted\n4. \"Interest Income\" of 10710.07 is added\n\nThis calculation would be:\nTotal Revenue - Total Cost - Total Expenses + Interest Income = Profit Before Tax\n5813420.67 - 3175000.00 - 1255269.09 + 10710.07 = 1393861.65\n\nSo the four components that make up the Profit Before Tax are:\n- Total Revenue: 5813420.67\n- Total Cost: 3175000.00\n- Total Expenses: 1255269.09\n- Interest Income: 10710.07\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1393861.65', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '5813420.67', 'sub_item value2': '3175000.00', 'sub_item value3': '1255269.09', 'sub_item value4': '10710.07'}}}\n```",
