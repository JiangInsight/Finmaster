                        "content": "I'll calculate the three requested financial ratios step by step.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\nThis ratio compares the operating cash flow to net income, showing how effectively a company converts its net income to cash.\n\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow ÷ Net Income\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = $1,598,438.00\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = $1,103,190.60\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = $1,598,438.00 ÷ $1,103,190.60 = 1.45\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio (assuming this is the Turnover Ratio requested)\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate revenue.\n\nFormula: Total Revenue ÷ Average Current Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = $5,813,420.67\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Current Assets = $8,000,000.00\n- End Current Assets = $10,906,753.86\n- Average Current Assets = ($8,000,000.00 + $10,906,753.86) ÷ 2 = $9,453,376.93\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = $5,813,420.67 ÷ $9,453,376.93 = 0.61\n\n### 3. Quick Ratio\nThe quick ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n\nFormula: (Current Assets - Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- End Current Assets = $10,906,753.86\n- End Inventory = $295,000.00\n- End Current Liabilities = $2,110,671.05\n\nQuick Ratio = ($10,906,753.86 - $295,000.00) ÷ $2,110,671.05 = $10,611,753.86 ÷ $2,110,671.05 = 5.03\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '1.45', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.61', 'Quick Ratio': '5.03'}}\n```",
