From the cash flow statement:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = $1,598,438.00\n\n2. From the balance sheet:\n   - Total Current Liabilities (End amount) = $2,110,671.05\n\nNow I can calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = $1,598,438.00 / $2,110,671.05\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = 0.7573 â‰ˆ 0.76\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is 0.76.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.76'} }\n```",
