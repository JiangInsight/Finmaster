Cash and cash equivalents (Cash)\n2. Current Debt (Current Liabilities)\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand: $5,603,438.00\n- Bank Deposits: $3,642,142.45\n- Total Cash: $5,603,438.00 + $3,642,142.45 = $9,245,580.45\n\n- Total Current Liabilities: $2,110,671.05\n\nNow I'll calculate the Cash to Current Debt Ratio:\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = Cash / Current Liabilities\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = $9,245,580.45 / $2,110,671.05 = 4.38\n\nI'll round to 2 decimal places: 4.38\n\n{\"solution\": {'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '4.38'}}",
