This ratio measures the percentage of a company's assets that are financed by debt.\n\nThe formula for Debt to Asset Ratio is:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet, I can identify:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $2,110,671.05\n- Total Assets = $16,213,861.65\n\nNow I'll calculate the ratio:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $2,110,671.05 / $16,213,861.65 = 0.1302\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places, the Debt to Asset Ratio is 0.13.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13'}}\n```",
