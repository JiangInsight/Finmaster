Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis measures the ability to cover current liabilities with operating cash flows.\nOCF Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n= $1,598,438.00 / $2,110,671.05\n= 0.76\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nThis measures the ability to repay total debt with operating cash flows.\nCF to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities (since there's no long-term debt)\n= $1,598,438.00 / $2,110,671.05\n= 0.76\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how many times inventory is sold and replaced over a period.\nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n= $3,175,000.00 / (($295,000.00 + $0) / 2)\n= $3,175,000.00 / $147,500.00\n= 21.53\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures the proportion of debt to equity.\nD/E Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n= $2,110,671.05 / $14,103,190.60\n= 0.15\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio\nThis measures the ability to cover current liabilities with quick assets (excluding inventory).\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n= ($10,906,753.86 - $295,000.00) / $2,110,671.05\n= $10,611,753.86 / $2,110,671.05\n= 5.03\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\nThis measures the ability to cover current liabilities with current assets.\nCurrent Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n= $10,906,753.86 / $2,110,671.05\n= 5.17\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.76', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.76', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '21.53', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Quick Ratio': '5.03', 'Current Ratio': '5.17'} }\n```",
