The formula is:\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Average Current Assets\n\nStep 1: Find the Revenue\nFrom the income statement, I can see:\nTotal Revenue = $5,813,420.67\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Average Current Assets\nInitial Current Assets (2023-12-31) = $8,000,000.00\nEnding Current Assets (2024-01-28) = $10,906,753.86\n\nAverage Current Assets = (Initial Current Assets + Ending Current Assets) / 2\nAverage Current Assets = ($8,000,000.00 + $10,906,753.86) / 2\nAverage Current Assets = $9,453,376.93\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Current Assets Turnover Ratio\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Average Current Assets\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = $5,813,420.67 / $9,453,376.93\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = 0.6149... â‰ˆ 0.61\n\nTherefore, the Current Assets Turnover Ratio is 0.61, which means that for each dollar invested in current assets, the company generates $0.61 in revenue.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.61'}}\n```",
