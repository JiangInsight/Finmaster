                        "content": "I'll solve this task step by step by calculating each of the required financial ratios based on the provided financial statements.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with cash generated from operations.\n- Operating Cash Flow = $1,598,438.00 (from cash flow statement)\n- Current Liabilities = $2,110,671.05 (from balance sheet)\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = 1,598,438.00 / 2,110,671.05 = 0.757\n\n## 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio measures the proportion of debt to equity used to finance a company's assets.\n- Total Liabilities = $2,110,671.05 (from balance sheet - equal to Current Liabilities as there are no non-current liabilities)\n- Total Equity = $14,103,190.60 (from balance sheet)\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = 2,110,671.05 / 14,103,190.60 = 0.150\n\n## 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n- Revenue = $5,813,420.67 (from income statement)\n- Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 16,213,861.65) / 2 = $14,606,930.83\n- Total Asset Turnover Ratio = 5,813,420.67 / 14,606,930.83 = 0.398\n\n## 4. Quick Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n- Quick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 10,906,753.86 - 295,000.00 = $10,611,753.86\n- Current Liabilities = $2,110,671.05\n- Quick Ratio = 10,611,753.86 / 2,110,671.05 = 5.027\n\n## 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow generated from operations.\n- Same as Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = 0.757\n\n## 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\nThis ratio measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit is generated with the money shareholders have invested.\n- Net Income = $1,103,190.60 (from income statement)\n- Average Equity = (13,000,000.00 + 14,103,190.60) / 2 = $13,551,595.30\n- ROE = (1,103,190.60 / 13,551,595.30) * 100% = 8.14%\n\n## 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\n- Revenue = $5,813,420.67 (from income statement)\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 1,355,463.34) / 2 = $677,731.67\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 5,813,420.67 / 677,731.67 = 8.579\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.757', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.150', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.398', 'Quick Ratio': '5.027', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.757', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '8.14%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '8.579'} }\n```",
