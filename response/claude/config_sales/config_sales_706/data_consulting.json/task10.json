Find the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n2. Find the Total Current Liabilities\n3. Divide the first value by the second value\n\nStep 1: From the cash flow statement, I can see:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = $1,598,438.00\n\nStep 2: From the balance sheet, I can see:\n- Total Current Liabilities (at end date) = $2,110,671.05\n\nStep 3: Calculate the ratio:\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = $1,598,438.00 / $2,110,671.05 = 0.7573\n\nStep 4: Round to two decimal places:\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = 0.76\n\nTherefore, the company has an Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio of 0.76, meaning it generates about 76 cents of operating cash flow for every dollar of current liabilities.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.76'} }\n```",
