Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio is calculated as: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = $2,110,671.05 (Total Current Liabilities)\n- Total Owner's Equity = $14,103,190.60\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $2,110,671.05 / $14,103,190.60 = 0.1496 ≈ 0.15\n\n## 2. Net Profit Margin\n\nThe Net Profit Margin is calculated as: (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = $1,103,190.60\n- Total Revenue = $5,813,420.67\n\nNet Profit Margin = ($1,103,190.60 / $5,813,420.67) × 100% = 18.9732% ≈ 18.97%\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis ratio is calculated as: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the financial statements:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = $1,598,438.00\n- Total Current Liabilities = $2,110,671.05\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = $1,598,438.00 / $2,110,671.05 = 0.7573 ≈ 0.76\n\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Net Profit Margin': '18.97%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.76'}}",
