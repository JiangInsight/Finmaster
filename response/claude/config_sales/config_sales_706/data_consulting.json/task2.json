The Quick Ratio measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n\nThe formula for Quick Ratio is:\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nLet me extract the relevant information from the balance sheet:\n\n1. Current Assets at the end date (2024-01-28): $10,906,753.86\n2. Inventory at the end date (2024-01-28): $295,000.00\n3. Current Liabilities at the end date (2024-01-28): $2,110,671.05\n\nNow I'll calculate the Quick Ratio:\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\nQuick Ratio = ($10,906,753.86 - $295,000.00) / $2,110,671.05\nQuick Ratio = $10,611,753.86 / $2,110,671.05\nQuick Ratio = 5.028\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: 5.03\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '5.03'}}\n```",
