The formula for ROE is:\n\nROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity\n\nStep 1: Identify the Net Income from the income statement.\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = $1,103,190.60\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Average Shareholders' Equity.\n- Beginning Shareholders' Equity (from initial balance sheet) = $13,000,000.00\n- Ending Shareholders' Equity (from ending balance sheet) = $14,103,190.60\n- Average Shareholders' Equity = ($13,000,000.00 + $14,103,190.60) / 2 = $13,551,595.30\n\nStep 3: Calculate ROE.\n- ROE = $1,103,190.60 / $13,551,595.30 = 0.0814 or 8.14%\n\nTherefore, the Return on Equity (ROE) is 8.14%.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '8.14%'} }\n```",
