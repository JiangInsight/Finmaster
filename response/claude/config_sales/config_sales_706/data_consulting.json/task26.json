Return on Equity (ROE)\nROE measures how efficiently a company uses its equity to generate profits. The formula is:\nROE = Net Profit / Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the income statement, Net Profit = $1,103,190.60\nFrom the balance sheet, Total Owner's Equity = $14,103,190.60\n\nROE = $1,103,190.60 / $14,103,190.60 = 0.0782 = 7.82%\n\n### 2. Debt to Asset Ratio\nThis ratio measures the proportion of assets financed by debt. The formula is:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\nTotal Current Liabilities = $2,110,671.05 (and there are no other liabilities)\nTotal Assets = $16,213,861.65\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $2,110,671.05 / $16,213,861.65 = 0.13 (rounded)\n\n### 3. Gross Profit Margin\nThis measures the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold. The formula is:\nGross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Total Revenue\n\nFrom the income statement:\nGross Profit = $2,638,420.67\nTotal Revenue = $5,813,420.67\n\nGross Profit Margin = $2,638,420.67 / $5,813,420.67 = 0.4539 = 45.39%\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '7.82%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.39%'}}\n```",
