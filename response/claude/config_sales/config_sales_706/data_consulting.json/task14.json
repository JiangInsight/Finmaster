                        "content": "I need to calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio, which measures how efficiently a company collects credit sales from customers.\n\nThe formula for Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is:\nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nLet me gather the necessary data from the statements:\n\n1. First, I need the Net Credit Sales, which is the Main Business Revenue from the income statement:\n   - Net Credit Sales = $5,813,420.67\n\n2. Then, I need the Average Accounts Receivable:\n   - Beginning Accounts Receivable (2023-12-31) = $0.00\n   - Ending Accounts Receivable (2024-01-28) = $1,355,463.34\n   - Average Accounts Receivable = ($0.00 + $1,355,463.34) / 2 = $677,731.67\n\n3. Now I can calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:\n   - Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $5,813,420.67 / $677,731.67 = 8.58\n\nLet me round this to 2 decimal places: 8.58\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '8.58'} }\n```",
