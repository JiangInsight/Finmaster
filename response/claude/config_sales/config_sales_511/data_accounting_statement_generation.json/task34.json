Revenue (from sales)\n2. Less: Cost of goods sold\n3. Equals: Gross profit\n4. Less: Operating expenses (administrative, sales, financial, depreciation)\n5. Plus: Other income (like interest received)\n6. Equals: Net profit\n\nLet me analyze the data:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Revenue\nI need to sum up all the sales transactions.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Cost of Goods Sold\nI'll sum up the cost_amount column for all sale transactions.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Operating Expenses\nI'll sum up all administrative expenses, sales expenses, financial expenses, and depreciation.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Other Income\nI'll sum up all interest receivables.\n\nLet me perform these calculations:\n\n1. Total Revenue: Sum of all \"Sale\" transaction amounts\n2. Cost of Goods Sold: Sum of all cost_amount values from \"Sale\" transactions\n3. Operating Expenses: Sum of \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Sales Expenses\", \"Financial Expenses\", and \"Depreciation\"\n4. Other Income: Sum of \"Interest Receivables\"\n\nFrom the data:\n- Total Sales: 4,892,767.94\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 2,805,000.00\n- Gross Profit: 2,087,767.94\n- Administrative Expenses: 327,945.95\n- Sales Expenses: 452,968.12\n- Financial Expenses: 165,740.12\n- Depreciation: 45,748.43\n- Total Operating Expenses: 992,402.62\n- Interest Receivables: 7,743.25\n\nNet Profit = Gross Profit + Interest Receivables - Operating Expenses\nNet Profit = 2,087,767.94 + 7,743.25 - 992,402.62\nNet Profit = 1,103,108.57\n\nTherefore, the final net profit is $1,103,108.57.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '1103108.57'} }\n```",
