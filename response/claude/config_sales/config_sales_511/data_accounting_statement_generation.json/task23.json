COGS represents the direct costs attributable to the goods sold, which includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the goods.\n\nLet me analyze the sales transactions to determine the COGS:\n\nStep 1: Identify all sale transactions in the data and extract their associated cost amounts.\n\nLooking at all the \"Sale\" type transactions in the data, each sale has a \"cost_amount\" field which represents the cost of the goods that were sold in that transaction.\n\nStep 2: Sum up all the cost_amount values from the sales transactions:\n\nGoing through all the sales:\n- Sale20240102002: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240102003: cost_amount = 30000.0\n- Sale20240102004: cost_amount = 10000.0\n- Sale20240102005: cost_amount = 40000.0\n- Sale20240103007: cost_amount = 40000.0\n- Sale20240104010: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240104011: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240104012: cost_amount = 40000.0\n- Sale20240105015: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240105016: cost_amount = 60000.0\n- Sale20240105017: cost_amount = 10000.0\n- Sale20240106021: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240106022: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240106023: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240106024: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240107027: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240107028: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240107029: cost_amount = 10000.0\n- Sale20240107030: cost_amount = 15000.0\n- Sale20240108032: cost_amount = 10000.0\n- Sale20240108033: cost_amount = 60000.0\n- Sale20240108034: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240109035: cost_amount = 30000.0\n- Sale20240109036: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240110039: cost_amount = 50000.0\n- Sale20240110040: cost_amount = 50000.0\n- Sale20240110041: cost_amount = 10000.0\n- Sale20240111044: cost_amount = 15000.0\n- Sale20240111045: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240111046: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240112048: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240112049: cost_amount = 10000.0\n- Sale20240112050: cost_amount = 60000.0\n- Sale20240113053: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240113054: cost_amount = 60000.0\n- Sale20240114056: cost_amount = 30000.0\n- Sale20240114057: cost_amount = 150000.0\n- Sale20240114058: cost_amount = 30000.0\n- Sale20240115060: cost_amount = 50000.0\n- Sale20240115061: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240115062: cost_amount = 150000.0\n- Sale20240115063: cost_amount = 40000.0\n- Sale20240116064: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240116065: cost_amount = 10000.0\n- Sale20240117067: cost_amount = 10000.0\n- Sale20240117068: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240118071: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240118072: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240118073: cost_amount = 30000.0\n- Sale20240119075: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240119076: cost_amount = 150000.0\n- Sale20240119077: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240119078: cost_amount = 10000.0\n- Sale20240120080: cost_amount = 30000.0\n- Sale20240120081: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240121083: cost_amount = 15000.0\n- Sale20240121084: cost_amount = 50000.0\n- Sale20240121085: cost_amount = 10000.0\n- Sale20240121086: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240122089: cost_amount = 5000.0\n- Sale20240123092: cost_amount = 10000.0\n- Sale20240124094: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240124095: cost_amount = 50000.0\n- Sale20240124096: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240125099: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240125100: cost_amount = 15000.0\n- Sale20240125101: cost_amount = 15000.0\n- Sale20240126104: cost_amount = 15000.0\n- Sale20240126105: cost_amount = 150000.0\n- Sale20240126106: cost_amount = 50000.0\n- Sale20240127110: cost_amount = 50000.0\n\nStep 3: Calculate the sum\nAdding all these cost_amount values:\nTotal COGS = 3,100,000.00\n\nTherefore, the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is 3,100,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cost of Goods Sold': '3100000.00'} }\n```",
