Purchase of fixed assets (outflow)\n2. Sale of fixed assets (inflow)\n3. Purchase of investments (outflow)\n4. Sale of investments (inflow)\n\nLet me go through the data and identify all transactions related to investing activities.\n\nLooking at the data, I can see the following transactions related to fixed assets:\n\n1. `FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 256859.19 | 256859.19 |  |  | Paid | Bank Transfer |  | S006 | Supplier 6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Processing Equipment4 | Processing Equipment`\n\n2. `FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 171985.91 | 171985.91 |  |  | Paid | Bank Transfer |  | S005 | Supplier 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Storage Facilities5 | Storage Facilities`\n\n3. `FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 55577.41 | 55577.41 |  |  | Paid | Bank Transfer |  | S007 | Supplier 7 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Production Line6 | Production Line`\n\n4. `FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 117840.57 | 117840.57 |  |  | Paid | Bank Transfer |  | S006 | Supplier 6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Production Line7 | Production Line`\n\n5. `FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 73932.79 | 73932.79 |  |  | Paid | Bank Transfer |  | S003 | Supplier 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Production Line8 | Production Line`\n\nThese are all outflows for fixed asset purchases.\n\nLet me calculate the total cash outflow from these investing activities:\n\nTotal Fixed Asset Purchases:\n256,859.19 + 171,985.91 + 55,577.41 + 117,840.57 + 73,932.79 = 676,195.87\n\nThere are no other transactions related to investing activities such as sale of fixed assets or investments.\n\nTherefore, the net cash flow from investing activities is:\n-676,195.87 (negative because it's an outflow)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-676195.87'} }\n```",
