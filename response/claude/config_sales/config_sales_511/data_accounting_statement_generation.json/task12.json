Let me follow a systematic approach:\n\n## Step 1: Identify purchases with \"Account Payable\" as the payment method or unpaid purchases\n\nFirst, I'll examine all the purchase transactions to find those where:\n- The payment_method is \"Account Payable\" OR\n- The payment/receipt_status is \"Unpaid\" for purchases\n\nLooking through the data:\n\n### Initial balance (as of 2023-12-31)\nLet me find purchases on or before 2023-12-31 that were unpaid:\n\n1. Purchase20231231009 - 60,000.00 - Unpaid, payment method: Account Payable\n2. Purchase20231231013 - 250,000.00 - Unpaid, payment method: Account Payable  \n3. Purchase20231231015 - 80,000.00 - Unpaid, payment method: Account Payable\n4. Purchase20231231018 - 60,000.00 - Unpaid, payment method: Account Payable\n\nInitial accounts payable = 60,000 + 250,000 + 80,000 + 60,000 = 450,000.00\n\n### Final balance (as of 2024-01-30)\nSince I don't see any transactions that paid off these accounts payables or added new ones during January 2024, the final accounts payable would remain the same as the initial value: 450,000.00\n\n## Step 2: Double-check for any missed transactions\nLet me verify one more time that I didn't miss any purchase transactions that might affect accounts payable.\n\nLooking through the entire dataset again, I confirm these are all the unpaid purchases or purchases made using \"Account Payable\" payment method. \n\nThere are no transactions showing payments of these accounts payable amounts during the period, and no additional accounts payable were created during January.\n\nTherefore:\n- Accounts Payable Initial Value: 450,000.00\n- Accounts Payable End Value: 450,000.00\n\nFormatting the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Payable Initial Value': '450000.00', 'Accounts Payable End Value': '450000.00'} }\n```",
