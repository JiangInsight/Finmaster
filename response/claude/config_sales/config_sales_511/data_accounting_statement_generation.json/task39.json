                        "content": "I need to calculate the \"Increase (Decrease) in Interest Receivable\" item for the cash flow statement. This represents the change in interest receivable during the period.\n\nTo calculate this, I need to:\n1. Find all Interest Receivable transactions\n2. Determine the total amount of interest receivable at the beginning and end of the period\n3. Calculate the change (ending - beginning)\n\nLet me track all the interest receivable transactions:\n\nJanuary 1, 2024: 417.41\nJanuary 2, 2024: 379.14\nJanuary 3, 2024: 340.97\nJanuary 4, 2024: 340.97\nJanuary 5, 2024: 340.97\nJanuary 6, 2024: 340.97\nJanuary 7, 2024: 330.29\nJanuary 8, 2024: 330.29\nJanuary 9, 2024: 330.29\nJanuary 10, 2024: 330.29\nJanuary 11, 2024: 323.17\nJanuary 12, 2024: 323.17\nJanuary 13, 2024: 323.17\nJanuary 14, 2024: 313.78\nJanuary 15, 2024: 313.78\nJanuary 16, 2024: 313.78\nJanuary 17, 2024: 313.78\nJanuary 18, 2024: 303.29\nJanuary 19, 2024: 303.29\nJanuary 20, 2024: 303.29\nJanuary 21, 2024: 303.29\nJanuary 22, 2024: 299.28\nJanuary 23, 2024: 299.28\nJanuary 24, 2024: 272.58\nJanuary 25, 2024: 272.58\nJanuary 26, 2024: 268.13\nJanuary 27, 2024: 261.55\n\nThere were no interest receivable transactions before January 1, so we can assume the beginning balance was 0.\n\nThe ending balance as of January 27 is 261.55.\n\nThe change in interest receivable is:\nEnding balance - Beginning balance = 261.55 - 0 = 261.55\n\nFor cash flow statement purposes, an increase in receivables is shown as a negative number (because it represents cash that hasn't been received). So the \"Increase (Decrease) in Interest Receivable\" would be -261.55.\n\nLet me double-check this by verifying whether there were any transactions where interest receivable was actually paid (which would reduce the balance). I don't see any such transactions in the data, so all of these amounts represent accrued but unpaid interest.\n\nThe sum of all interest receivable entries is 8,680.60, but that doesn't represent the ending balance. The ending balance is the last interest receivable transaction value, which is 261.55.\n\nSince this is an increase in a receivable, it's a use of cash and should be presented as a negative number in the cash flow statement.\n\nTherefore, the \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" is -261.55.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-261.55'} }\n```",
