Looking through the data, I can see that there are sales transactions that include tax information. Each sale transaction has a \"tax_amount\" field which represents the tax collected on the sale.\n\nTo calculate taxes payable:\n1. The initial value would be any taxes payable at the beginning (December 31, 2023)\n2. The end value would be the accumulated taxes that need to be paid as of January 27, 2024\n\nLet me go through the data and extract all the tax amounts from sales transactions:\n\nLooking at the transaction data, there is no explicit initial tax payable value mentioned on December 31, 2023. So the initial value would be 0.\n\nFor the end value, I need to sum up all the tax amounts from the sales transactions:\n\n- Sale20240102002: tax_amount = 1810.79\n- Sale20240102003: tax_amount = 2956.22\n- Sale20240102004: tax_amount = 998.49\n- Sale20240102005: tax_amount = 3638.25\n- Sale20240103007: tax_amount = 3720.32\n- Sale20240104010: tax_amount = 1747.25\n- Sale20240104011: tax_amount = 1761.05\n- Sale20240104012: tax_amount = 3866.39\n- Sale20240105015: tax_amount = 1738.99\n- Sale20240105016: tax_amount = 5989.72\n- Sale20240105017: tax_amount = 910.5\n- Sale20240106021: tax_amount = 8781.98\n- Sale20240106022: tax_amount = 9010.23\n- Sale20240106023: tax_amount = 436.19\n- Sale20240106024: tax_amount = 1748.84\n- Sale20240107027: tax_amount = 8967.59\n- Sale20240107028: tax_amount = 1935.67\n- Sale20240107029: tax_amount = 914.84\n- Sale20240107030: tax_amount = 1456.61\n- Sale20240108032: tax_amount = 885.93\n- Sale20240108033: tax_amount = 5153.67\n- Sale20240108034: tax_amount = 1902.58\n- Sale20240109035: tax_amount = 2954.99\n- Sale20240109036: tax_amount = 443.51\n- Sale20240110039: tax_amount = 4888.67\n- Sale20240110040: tax_amount = 4256.21\n- Sale20240110041: tax_amount = 872.04\n- Sale20240111044: tax_amount = 1413.27\n- Sale20240111045: tax_amount = 9823.45\n- Sale20240111046: tax_amount = 9186.14\n- Sale20240112048: tax_amount = 1976.6\n- Sale20240112049: tax_amount = 906.85\n- Sale20240112050: tax_amount = 5123.21\n- Sale20240113053: tax_amount = 1770.31\n- Sale20240113054: tax_amount = 5457.36\n- Sale20240114056: tax_amount = 2597.76\n- Sale20240114057: tax_amount = 13435.14\n- Sale20240114058: tax_amount = 2965.95\n- Sale20240115060: tax_amount = 4289.37\n- Sale20240115061: tax_amount = 9002.98\n- Sale20240115062: tax_amount = 14401.75\n- Sale20240115063: tax_amount = 3750.52\n- Sale20240116064: tax_amount = 499.6\n- Sale20240116065: tax_amount = 966.56\n- Sale20240117067: tax_amount = 903.1\n- Sale20240117068: tax_amount = 452.58\n- Sale20240118071: tax_amount = 9881.36\n- Sale20240118072: tax_amount = 1869.41\n- Sale20240118073: tax_amount = 2918.76\n- Sale20240119075: tax_amount = 9408.87\n- Sale20240119076: tax_amount = 13186.36\n- Sale20240119077: tax_amount = 1951.72\n- Sale20240119078: tax_amount = 916.33\n- Sale20240120080: tax_amount = 2684.4\n- Sale20240120081: tax_amount = 1760.95\n- Sale20240121083: tax_amount = 1391.33\n- Sale20240121084: tax_amount = 4272.96\n- Sale20240121085: tax_amount = 890.64\n- Sale20240121086: tax_amount = 461.49\n- Sale20240122089: tax_amount = 498.68\n- Sale20240123092: tax_amount = 921.87\n- Sale20240124094: tax_amount = 8597.85\n- Sale20240124095: tax_amount = 4891.59\n- Sale20240124096: tax_amount = 8836.0\n- Sale20240125099: tax_amount = 1993.4\n- Sale20240125100: tax_amount = 1415.67\n- Sale20240125101: tax_amount = 1456.68\n- Sale20240126104: tax_amount = 1370.52\n- Sale20240126105: tax_amount = 14476.89\n- Sale20240126106: tax_amount = 4885.15\n- Sale20240127110: tax_amount = 4670.6\n\nAdding all these tax amounts:\nTotal taxes payable = 277,411.96\n\nGiven that these are the taxes collected but not yet remitted to the tax authority, this represents the taxes payable as of January 27, 2024.\n\nTherefore:\n- Initial Taxes Payable (Dec 31, 2023): 0.00\n- End Taxes Payable (Jan 27, 2024): 277,411.96\n\nFor formatting purposes, let's round to 2 decimal places:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Taxes Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Taxes Payable End Value': '277411.96'}}\n```",
