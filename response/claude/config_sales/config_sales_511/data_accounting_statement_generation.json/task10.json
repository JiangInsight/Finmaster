                        "content": "I need to calculate the property, plant, and non-current assets in the balance sheet, both at the beginning and end of the period.\n\nLet's first identify the initial value of non-current assets and then track any changes.\n\n## Step 1: Identify initial non-current assets\nFrom the transactions data, I can see:\n```\nInitial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0\n```\nThis indicates that the company had 5,000,000.00 in fixed assets at the beginning of the period (December 31, 2023).\n\n## Step 2: Identify any additions to non-current assets\nI need to check for any fixed asset purchases during the period:\n\n```\nFixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 256859.19 | 256859.19 | ... | Processing Equipment4 | Processing Equipment\nFixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 171985.91 | 171985.91 | ... | Storage Facilities5 | Storage Facilities\nFixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 55577.41 | 55577.41 | ... | Production Line6 | Production Line\nFixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 117840.57 | 117840.57 | ... | Production Line7 | Production Line\nFixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 73932.79 | 73932.79 | ... | Production Line8 | Production Line\n```\n\nTotal fixed asset additions:\n- 256,859.19 (Processing Equipment)\n- 171,985.91 (Storage Facilities)\n- 55,577.41 (Production Line)\n- 117,840.57 (Production Line)\n- 73,932.79 (Production Line)\n\nTotal additions = 256,859.19 + 171,985.91 + 55,577.41 + 117,840.57 + 73,932.79 = 676,195.87\n\n## Step 3: Identify depreciation on non-current assets\nI see one depreciation transaction:\n```\nDepreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45748.43000000001 | 45748.43000000001\n```\n\nThis indicates a depreciation expense of 45,748.43 which reduces the value of non-current assets.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the ending value of non-current assets\nThe calculation is:\nInitial value + Additions - Depreciation = Ending value\n\n5,000,000.00 + 676,195.87 - 45,748.43 = 5,630,447.44\n\nHowever, I need to double-check this calculation. The fixed asset purchases appear to have been made on December 31, 2023, which is the same date as the initial balance. It's possible these purchases are already included in the initial 5,000,000.00.\n\nLooking more carefully, the initial fixed assets entry is part of \"Initial20231231001\", and the fixed asset purchases have their own transaction IDs. This suggests they are separate transactions that happened on the same date. Therefore, I should include them as additions.\n\nFinal calculation:\n5,000,000.00 + 676,195.87 - 45,748.43 = 5,630,447.44\n\nLet's format this to 2 decimal places:\n- Initial value: 5,000,000.00\n- End value: 5,630,447.44\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '5630447.44'} }\n```",
