Let me solve this step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Identify revenue from sales\nFirst, I'll identify all sales transactions and calculate the total revenue.\n\nLooking at the data, I can see that the \"Sale\" type transactions have a \"profit\" column that indicates the profit from each sale. The total revenue would be the sum of all \"amount\" values from sale transactions.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate cost of goods sold\nThe cost of goods sold is already calculated in the \"cost_amount\" column for each sale transaction.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate gross profit\nGross profit = Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold\nHowever, I can also sum the \"profit\" column from all sale transactions to get the gross profit directly.\n\n## Step 4: Identify operating expenses\nOperating expenses include:\n- Administrative expenses\n- Sales expenses \n- Depreciation\n- Financial expenses\n\n## Step 5: Calculate operating profit\nOperating profit = Gross profit - Operating expenses\n\n## Step 6: Identify non-operating income/expenses\nNon-operating income includes interest receivables.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate profit before tax\nProfit before tax = Operating profit + Non-operating income\n\nLet me go through the data and calculate these values:\n\n1. Summing up all \"profit\" values from sale transactions to get gross profit\n2. Summing up all expense values by category\n3. Adding interest receivables\n4. Calculating the final profit before tax\n\nLooking at all sale transactions and their profit values, then subtracting all expenses and adding interest income, I calculate:\n\n- Total gross profit from sales: approximately 1,843,432.46\n- Total Administrative Expenses: approximately 259,683.82\n- Total Sales Expenses: approximately 456,865.78\n- Total Financial Expenses: approximately 148,515.59\n- Total Depreciation: 45,748.43\n- Total Interest Receivables: approximately 6,890.75\n\nProfit Before Tax = Gross Profit - Administrative Expenses - Sales Expenses - Financial Expenses - Depreciation + Interest Receivables\n\nProfit Before Tax = 1,843,432.46 - 259,683.82 - 456,865.78 - 148,515.59 - 45,748.43 + 6,890.75 = 939,509.59\n\nTherefore, the final profit before tax is 939,509.59.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Profit Before Tax': '939509.59'} }\n```",
