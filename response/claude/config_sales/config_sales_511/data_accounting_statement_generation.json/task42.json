The tax payable represents taxes that have been incurred but not yet paid.\n\n## Step 1: Understand what to look for\nFor tax payable in the cash flow statement, I need to identify all tax-related transactions.

However, I don't see any specific tax payment transactions in the data.\n\n## Result\nSince there were no tax payments made during the period, the increase in tax payable equals the total tax collected, which is 271,550.92.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '271550.92'}}",
