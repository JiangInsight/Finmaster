From the cash flow statement:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -81,548.37\n\n2. From the balance sheet:\n   - Total Current Liabilities (End amount) = 728,279.50\n\nNow I'll calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -81,548.37 / 728,279.50 = -0.111972\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: -0.11\n\nTherefore, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is -0.11, indicating that the company's operating cash flow is negative and insufficient to cover its current liabilities.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.11'}}\n```",
