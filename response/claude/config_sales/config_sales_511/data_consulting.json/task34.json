                        "content": "I'll calculate each financial ratio step by step based on the provided financial statements.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with the cash generated from operations.\n- Operating Cash Flow = -81,548.37 (from Cash Flow statement)\n- Current Liabilities = 728,279.50 (from Balance Sheet)\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -81,548.37 ÷ 728,279.50 = -0.11\n\n## 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures a company's financial leverage by comparing total debt to shareholders' equity.\n- Total Liabilities = 728,279.50 (only current liabilities, no long-term debt shown)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,095,371.35\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = 728,279.50 ÷ 14,095,371.35 = 0.05\n\n## 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n- Total Revenue = 5,565,589.48\n- Total Assets = 14,823,650.85\n- Total Asset Turnover Ratio = 5,565,589.48 ÷ 14,823,650.85 = 0.38\n\n## 4. Quick Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without relying on inventory sales.\n- Current Assets = 9,193,203.41\n- Inventory = 440,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 728,279.50\n- Quick Ratio = (9,193,203.41 - 440,000.00) ÷ 728,279.50 = 12.02\n\n## 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis is the same as Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio calculated earlier.\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -0.11\n\n## 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\nThis measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit it generates with the money shareholders have invested.\n- Net Profit = 1,095,371.35\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,095,371.35\n- ROE = 1,095,371.35 ÷ 14,095,371.35 = 0.0777 = 7.77%\n\n## 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company collects revenue from customers.\n- Total Revenue = 5,565,589.48\n- Accounts Receivable = 1,502,354.84\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 5,565,589.48 ÷ 1,502,354.84 = 3.70\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.11', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.38', 'Quick Ratio': '12.02', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.11', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '7.77%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.70'} }\n```",
