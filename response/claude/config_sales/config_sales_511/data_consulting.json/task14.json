The formula is:\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nStep 1: Identify Net Credit Sales (Net Revenue)\nFrom the income statement, the Main Business Revenue (assumed to be credit sales) is $5,565,589.48.\n\nStep 2: Calculate Average Accounts Receivable\nBeginning Accounts Receivable (from Initial_amount): $0.00\nEnding Accounts Receivable (from End_amount): $1,502,354.84\nAverage Accounts Receivable = ($0.00 + $1,502,354.84) / 2 = $751,177.42\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $5,565,589.48 / $751,177.42 = 7.41\n\nStep 4: Round to 2 decimal places\n7.41\n\nTherefore, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is 7.41.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.41'} }\n```",
