Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's financial leverage by comparing total liabilities to shareholders' equity.\n\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = $728,279.50\n- Total Owner's Equity = $14,095,371.35\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $728,279.50 / $14,095,371.35 = 0.0517\n\n## 2. Net Profit Margin\nThis ratio measures the percentage of revenue that is converted into net profit.\n\nFormula: Net Profit / Total Revenue × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = $1,095,371.35\n- Total Revenue = $5,565,589.48\n\nNet Profit Margin = ($1,095,371.35 / $5,565,589.48) × 100% = 19.68%\n\n## 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit.\n\nFormula: Net Profit / Total Assets × 100%\n\nFrom the financial statements:\n- Net Profit = $1,095,371.35\n- Total Assets (end of period) = $14,823,650.85\n\nROA = ($1,095,371.35 / $14,823,650.85) × 100% = 7.39%\n\n## 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\n\nFormula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nSince we only have the ending accounts receivable (no beginning), and assuming all sales are credit sales:\n- Net Credit Sales (Total Revenue) = $5,565,589.48\n- Average Accounts Receivable ≈ End Accounts Receivable = $1,502,354.84\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $5,565,589.48 / $1,502,354.84 = 3.70\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05', 'Net Profit Margin': '19.68%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '7.39%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.70'} }\n```",
