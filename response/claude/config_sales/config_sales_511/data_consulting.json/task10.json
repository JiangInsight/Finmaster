This ratio measures a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities using cash generated from operations.\n\nThe formula is:\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the provided financial statements:\n\n1. Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -81,548.37 (from cash flow statement)\n2. Total Current Liabilities = 728,279.50 (from the end amount in balance sheet)\n\nCalculating the ratio:\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -81,548.37 / 728,279.50 = -0.112\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: -0.11\n\nTherefore, the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities ratio is -0.11.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.11'}}\n```",
