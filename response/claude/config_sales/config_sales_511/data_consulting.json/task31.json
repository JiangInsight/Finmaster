Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio shows how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\nFormula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nSince we only have ending accounts receivable (no beginning), I'll use:\n- Net Credit Sales (Revenue): $5,565,589.48\n- Ending Accounts Receivable: $1,502,354.84\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $5,565,589.48 / $1,502,354.84 = 3.70\n\n## 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio \nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term debts using operating cash flow.\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\n- Operating Cash Flow: -$81,548.37\n- Current Liabilities: $728,279.50\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$81,548.37 / $728,279.50 = -0.11\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -0.11\n\n## 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\nFormula: Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\n- Net Sales: $5,565,589.48\n- Average Total Assets: ($13,000,000.00 + $14,823,650.85) / 2 = $13,911,825.43\n\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = $5,565,589.48 / $13,911,825.43 = 0.40\n\n## 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis shows the proportion of equity and debt the company uses to finance its assets.\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities: $728,279.50\n- Total Equity: $14,095,371.35\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $728,279.50 / $14,095,371.35 = 0.05\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.70', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-0.11', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.11', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.40', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05'} }\n```",
