                        "content": "I need to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio from the balance sheet data. This ratio shows what proportion of a company's assets is financed by debt.\n\nThe formula for Debt to Asset Ratio is:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nLet me extract the required values from the end-of-period data:\n\n1. Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $728,279.50\n   (Looking at the balance sheet, I don't see any long-term liabilities, so Total Liabilities equals Total Current Liabilities)\n\n2. Total Assets = $14,823,650.85\n\nNow I'll calculate the ratio:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $728,279.50 / $14,823,650.85 = 0.0491\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.05\n\nThis means that approximately 5% of the company's assets are financed by debt.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.05'} }\n```",
