Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -81,548.37\n2. Capital Expenditures (Purchase of Fixed Assets) = 676,195.87 (Note: this is presented as a positive number in the statement, but represents an outflow)\n\nTherefore:\nFCF = -81,548.37 - 676,195.87 = -757,744.24\n\nI can also verify this by looking at the Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents, which is -757,744.24. This confirms my calculation is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-757744.24'}}\n```",
