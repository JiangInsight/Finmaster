This ratio measures a company's financial leverage by comparing its total debt to its total equity.\n\nThe formula for Debt to Equity Ratio is:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet as of 2024-01-27:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $728,279.50\n- Total Owner's Equity = $14,095,371.35\n\nNow I'll calculate the ratio:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $728,279.50 / $14,095,371.35 = 0.0516691...\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: 0.05\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05'}}\n```",
