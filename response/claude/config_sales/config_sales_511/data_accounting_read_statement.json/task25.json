Cost of Goods Sold: 3,020,000.00 (costs related to delivering goods/services)\n2. Selling Expenses: 662,884.34 (costs related to securing customer orders)\n\nBased on the example given, the solution focuses on \"Selling Expenses\" as the specific cost incurred to secure customer orders. This is consistent with standard accounting practices where selling expenses represent the costs of marketing, sales, and customer acquisition.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '662884.34'}}\n```",
