In the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section, I can see:\n   - \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an amount of 676,195.87\n   - \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with a value of -676,195.87\n\nThe negative sign in the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" indicates that there was a net outflow of cash from investing activities.\n\n2. To decompose this into a component sub-item:\n   The only sub-item listed is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of 676,195.87.\n   This is a positive number because it represents the amount spent, but contributes negatively to cash flow.\n\nTherefore, the net amount from investing activities is -676,195.87, and its sub-item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of 676,195.87.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-676195.87', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '676195.87'}} }\n```",
