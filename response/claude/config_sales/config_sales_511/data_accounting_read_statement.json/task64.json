Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n- \"Paid-in Capital\" represents capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares: 13000000.00\n- \"Accounts Payable\" shows the amount owed by the entity for goods or services purchased on credit: 450000.00\n\n**Income Statement:**\n- \"Profit Before Tax\" shows the profit or loss before deducting tax expense: 1373650.85\n\nThese three items match the requirements specified in the task. I'll extract them in the requested order:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1373650.85', 'value3': '450000.00'}}\n```",
