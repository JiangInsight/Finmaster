Inventory typically represents goods held for sale, goods in production, or raw materials to be used in production.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Initial inventory value (2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End inventory value (2024-01-27): 440000.00\n\nThese are the values I need to extract as the initial and final values of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '440000.00'}}\n```",
