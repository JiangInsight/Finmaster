Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\nFor the first item (securing customer orders/delivering goods):\n- From the Income Statement, \"Selling Expenses\" represent costs to secure customer orders and deliver goods. This value is $662,884.34.\n\nFor the second item (cash payments for long-term assets):\n- From the Cash Flow Statement, \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" represents cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment. This value is $676,195.87.\n\nTherefore:\n- value1 = $662,884.34\n- value2 = $676,195.87\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '662884.34', 'value2': '676195.87'}}\n```",
