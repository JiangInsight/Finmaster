This is the account that tracks money the company owes to its vendors or suppliers.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet provided in the problem:\n- Accounts Payable has an initial amount of 0.00 on 2023-12-31\n- Accounts Payable has an end amount of 450000.00 on 2024-01-27\n\nTherefore, the specific line item I need to extract is Accounts Payable, with:\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- End value: 450000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '450000.00'}}\n```",
