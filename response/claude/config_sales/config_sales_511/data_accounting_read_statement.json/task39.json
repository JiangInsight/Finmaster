When this line shows a negative value, it represents an increase in inventory (cash outflow). When positive, it represents a decrease in inventory (cash inflow).\n\nI can see the following line item related to inventory:\n\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with an amount of \"-440000.00\"\n\nSince the value is negative (-440000.00), this represents an increase in inventory, not a reduction. However, the task is asking for the \"reduction in the amount of assets held for sale\", which would be the opposite of what we see.\n\nIn accounting terms, the absolute value of this negative figure represents the amount by which inventory increased, so the value I need to report is \"-440000.00\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-440000.00'}}\n```",
