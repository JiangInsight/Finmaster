These are the liabilities that are part of the normal business operations.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet provided:\n\n1. The \"Total Current Liabilities\" line item shows:\n   - Initial amount: 0.00 (on 2023-12-31)\n   - End amount: 728279.50 (on 2024-01-27)\n\n2. This includes:\n   - Accounts Payable: 450000.00\n   - Taxes Payable: 278279.50\n\nSince current liabilities are the ones expected to be settled in the normal course of business operations, the \"Total Current Liabilities\" is the value I need to extract.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '728279.50'}}\n```",
