When we see \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" in the cash flow statement, this shows how this amount has changed during the period.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n- The line \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" shows a value of -1502354.84\n- The negative value indicates an increase in accounts receivable (more money is owed to the company)\n- Since we need to identify the decrease, this is the relevant line item\n\nThe value is -1502354.84, which represents an increase in accounts receivable (or a decrease in cash due to more outstanding credit). This is precisely the figure we need to extract.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1502354.84'}}\n```",
