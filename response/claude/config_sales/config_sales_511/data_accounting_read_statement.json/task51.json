First, I'll check the balance sheet for any interest-related accounts. I can see \"Interest Receivable\" which typically represents interest that has been earned but not yet received.\n   - Initial amount: 0.00 (on 2023-12-31)\n   - End amount: 8592.81 (on 2024-01-27)\n\n2. I'll verify this by checking the income statement. I see \"Interest Income\" listed as 8592.81, which matches the end value of Interest Receivable on the balance sheet.\n\n3. Looking at the cash flow statement, I can also see \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" with a value of -8592.81, which represents the change in this account over the period (negative value means an increase).\n\nThis confirms that 8592.81 represents interest that has accrued but not yet been received, as it appears as income on the income statement but remains as a receivable on the balance sheet rather than being converted to cash.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '8592.81'}}\n```",
