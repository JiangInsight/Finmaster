The total income line item appears to be \"Total Revenue\" with a value of 5,565,589.48.\n2. This revenue consists of one component from the statement: \"Main Business Revenue\" which is also 5,565,589.48.\n\nThe pattern is similar to the example provided, where Total Revenue is the primary income line item, and Main Business Revenue is its component.\n\nTherefore, my solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5565589.48', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '5565589.48'}}}\n```",
