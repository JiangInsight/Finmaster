The net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nFirst, let me analyze the financial statements:\n\nFor interest accrued but not yet received, I need to look for \"Interest Receivable\" in the balance sheet:\n- From the balance sheet, the Interest Receivable end amount is 8592.81\n\nFor the net addition in cash and cash equivalents, I need to look at the Cash Flow Statement:\n- From the cash flow statement, under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\", the \"Net Increase\" is -757744.24\n\nSo the two values I need are:\n1. Interest Receivable: 8592.81\n2. Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents: -757744.24\n\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '8592.81', 'value2': '-757744.24'}}",
