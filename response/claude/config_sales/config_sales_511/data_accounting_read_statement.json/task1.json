Cash on Hand: Initial amount = 3,000,000.00 (2023-12-31), End amount = 4,303,451.63 (2024-01-27)\n2. Bank Deposits: Initial amount = 5,000,000.00 (2023-12-31), End amount = 2,938,804.13 (2024-01-27)\n\nBoth \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" represent cash that is available for day-to-day operations. Since the task requires me to extract the specific line items and value of cash held by the entity that is available for use in its day-to-day operations, I need to add these two amounts together:\n\nInitial cash value (2023-12-31):\n- Cash on Hand: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank Deposits: 5,000,000.00\n- Total: 8,000,000.00\n\nEnd cash value (2024-01-27):\n- Cash on Hand: 4,303,451.63\n- Bank Deposits: 2,938,804.13\n- Total: 7,242,255.76\n\nTherefore, the initial value of cash available for day-to-day operations is 8,000,000.00 and the end value is 7,242,255.76.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '7242255.76'}}\n```",
