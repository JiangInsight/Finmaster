This would be listed as \"Main Business Revenue\" in the income statement.\n\nFrom the provided problem, I can see that the \"Main Business Revenue\" is 5565589.48 as of 2024-01-27. This represents the income generated from the entity's primary business activities.\n\nWhile \"Interest Income\" (8592.81) is also a form of income, it is typically considered financial income rather than income from core operating activities.\n\nTherefore, the value of income arising from the entity's core operating activities is 5565589.48.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5565589.48'} }\n```",
