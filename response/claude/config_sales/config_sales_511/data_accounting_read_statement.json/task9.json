Tax liabilities are typically shown as \"Taxes Payable\" or similar accounts on the balance sheet.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet provided, I can see there is a line item called \"Taxes Payable\" which represents taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid to tax authorities.\n\nAccording to the balance sheet:\n- The initial value of \"Taxes Payable\" as of 2023-12-31 is 0.00\n- The end value of \"Taxes Payable\" as of 2024-01-27 is 278279.50\n\nTherefore, the tax accrued but not yet paid:\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- End value: 278279.50\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '278279.50'}}\n```",
