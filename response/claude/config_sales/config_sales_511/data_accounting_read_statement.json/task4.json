This is exactly what the task is asking for.\n\nFor this account:\n- The initial value on 2023-12-31 is 0.00\n- The end value on 2024-01-27 is 8592.81\n\nTherefore, the interest accrued but not yet received had an initial value of 0.00 and increased to 8592.81 by the end of the reporting period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '8592.81'}}\n```",
