I can see that \"Total Non-current Assets\" is the line item that shows assets not expected to be realized in the normal operating cycle.\n\n2. For the initial value (as of 2023-12-31), the Total Non-current Assets amount is 5000000.00.\n\n3. For the end value (as of 2024-01-27), the Total Non-current Assets amount is 5630447.44.\n\nThese non-current assets typically include fixed assets (minus accumulated depreciation) and other long-term investments or assets.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5630447.44'}}\n```",
