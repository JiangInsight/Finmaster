First, I notice a category mismatch:\n   - The ID is \"Sale20240119075\" suggesting it should be a \"Sale\" transaction\n   - But the recorded_type is \"Depreciation\" instead of \"Sale\"\n   - The invoice clearly states \"an invoice was issued for a Sale\"\n\n2. There's also a quantity discrepancy:\n   - The invoice mentions \"consisting of 2.0 units\"\n   - But the recorded_quantity shows only \"1.0\" unit\n   - This can be further verified by looking at the total amount calculation\n\n3. Invoice data validation:\n   - The invoice shows a unit price of $94088.72\n   - With 2 units, the total would be $188177.44 \n   - But the recorded_amount is only $94088.72\n   - The invoice also confirms the total should be $188177.44\n\n4. The profit calculation also supports 2 units:\n   - Cost amount is $100,000\n   - Total profit is $88,177.44\n   - This is consistent with selling 2 units at $94,088.72 each\n\nThese inconsistencies are clearly documented in the risk_issues field which mentions both the category and quantity errors.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Depreciation', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '2.0', 'Recorded quantity': '1.0', 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '188177.44', 'Recorded amount': '94088.72', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240119075'} }",
