Inconsistencies between fields within the same transaction\n2. Discrepancies between recorded values and what would be expected based on calculations\n3. Mismatches between the invoice description and recorded data\n\nFirst, I'll focus on Sale20240124094:\n\n1. Date inconsistency:\n   - Invoice states: \"On January 24, 2024...\"\n   - Recorded date: \"2024-02-23\"\n   - This is a clear inconsistency where the recorded date doesn't match the invoice date\n\n2. Unit price inconsistency:\n   - Invoice mentions: \"at a unit price of $85978.50\"\n   - Recorded unit price: $69347.48\n   - This is a significant difference\n\n3. Total amount inconsistency:\n   - Invoice states: \"totaling $171957.00\"\n   - Recorded amount: $197405.74\n   - This doesn't match either the calculation from recorded price or from invoice price\n\nThe correct values should be:\n- Date: 2024-01-24 (from invoice)\n- Unit price: $85978.50 (from invoice)\n- Total amount: $171957.00 (from invoice)\n\nLet me check if there are any other inconsistencies in the data.\n\nLooking at Sale20240130057:\n- Invoice mentions date of \"January 30, 2024\" but recorded date is \"2024-02-01\"\n- Invoice states unit price of \"$24766.75\" but recorded unit price is \"$21750.10\"\n- Invoice states total amount of \"$74300.25\" but recorded amount is \"$90992.35\"\n\nThese transactions have clear inconsistencies between their recorded values and the invoice descriptions, which should be considered the more reliable source.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-24', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-23', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '85978.50', 'Recorded price': '69347.48', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '171957.00', 'Recorded amount': '197405.74', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240124094'} }\n```",
