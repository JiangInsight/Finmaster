The recorded_type is \"Administrative Expenses\" but the invoice starts with \"On January 25, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale...\"\n2. The recorded_date is \"2024-01-26\" but the invoice indicates \"January 25, 2024\"\n3. The recorded_amount is $48,144.10 but the invoice states a total of $39,867.96\n4. The recorded_unit_price is $34,994.49 but the invoice mentions $39,867.96\n5. The recorded_tax_amount is $32,997.45 but the invoice states $1,993.40\n\nThis transaction has multiple inconsistencies between the recorded fields and the invoice information.
