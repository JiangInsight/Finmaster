This could be an issue, but it might also be intentional if they represent different components of the same fixed asset purchase.\n\nFor transaction \"Interest20240114014\":\n- The invoice says: \"On January 14, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Interest Receivables, totaling $313.78...\"\n- But there are no inconsistencies in the recorded fields compared to what's stated in the invoice.\n\nAfter checking all transactions, I've found that \"Expense20240103001\" has clear inconsistencies with its invoice description.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-03', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-16', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '19464.42', 'Recorded amount': '24177.72', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240103001'} }",
