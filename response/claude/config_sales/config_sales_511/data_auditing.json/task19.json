The transaction type doesn't match (Depreciation vs Sales Expenses)\n2. The date doesn't match (Jan 7 vs Jan 3)\n\nThe invoice is likely correct, meaning this was a Sales Expenses transaction issued on January 3, 2024, but was incorrectly recorded as Depreciation on January 7.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sales Expenses\", \"Recorded category\": \"Depreciation\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-03\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-07\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Expense20240103001\"}}\n```",
