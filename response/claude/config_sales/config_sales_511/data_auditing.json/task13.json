Transaction ID: Sale20240107028\n   - This appears to be a Sale transaction based on the ID, but is recorded as \"Sales Expenses\" in the recorded_type field\n   - The invoice mentions: \"On January 07, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $19356.65, totaling $38713.30...\"\n   - The tax amount in the invoice is stated as \"with a tax amount of $1935.67\", but the recorded_tax_amount is $43122.14\n   - These are clear inconsistencies between the invoice information and the recorded information\n\n2. Looking at the tax amount calculation for Sale20240107028:\n   - The unit price is $19356.65\n   - The quantity is 2.0\n   - The total amount is $38713.30\n   - The tax amount should be $1935.67 (which is approximately 5% of the total amount)\n   - The recorded tax amount is $43122.14, which is more than the total amount itself\n\n3. Looking at the transaction type inconsistency:\n   - The ID starts with \"Sale\" indicating it should be a sale transaction\n   - The recorded_type is \"Sales Expenses\" which is inconsistent with the ID and invoice description\n   - The invoice clearly describes a sale transaction with units, unit price, cost amount, etc.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can identify two clear inconsistencies in the Sale20240107028 transaction:\n1. The transaction type is incorrectly recorded as \"Sales Expenses\" when it should be \"Sale\"\n2. The tax amount is incorrectly recorded as $43122.14 when it should be $1935.67\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': '1935.67', 'Recorded tax': '43122.14', 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240107028'} }\n```",
