The cost amount for this transaction was $100000.00, with a tax amount of $6234.41, leading to a total amount due of $118453.75. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nBut the recorded amount is $138369.24, which doesn't match the calculated total of $124688.16 (2.0 units × $62344.08).\n\n## Analyzing transaction Sale20240126104:\nThe invoice states: \"On January 26, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 3.0 units at a unit price of $9136.80, totaling $27410.40.
