I'll focus on comparing the invoice details with the recorded data, since the invoice is considered more reliable.\n\nLet me examine transaction Sale20240126106:\n\n1. According to the invoice text: \"On January 26, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $97702.96, totaling $97702.96. The cost amount for this transaction was $50000.00, with a tax amount of $4885.15, leading to a total amount due of $92817.81. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\n2. The recorded values show:\n   - recorded_quantity: 0.0 (should be 1.0)\n   - recorded_amount: $118,558.82 (should be $97,702.96)\n   - recorded_tax_amount: $83,038.84 (should be $4,885.15)\n   - recorded_unit_price: $94,678.46 (should be $97,702.96)\n\nThese differences are significant and cannot be attributed to rounding errors. The invoice details are more reliable, and the recorded data contains multiple inconsistencies.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '1.0', 'Recorded quantity': '0.0', 'Original price': '97702.96', 'Recorded price': '94678.46', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '97702.96', 'Recorded amount': '118558.82', 'Original tax': '4885.15', 'Recorded tax': '83038.84', 'Original profit': '47702.96', 'Recorded profit': '47702.96', 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240126106'} }",
