The date in the record (Jan 25) doesn't match the invoice date (Jan 5)\n2. The unit price (34747.5) doesn't match what's calculated from the invoice total (34779.88)\n\nThe invoice is considered the more reliable source, so the original values should be:\n- Original date: 2024-01-05\n- Original price: 34779.88\n\nLet me verify this is consistent with other calculations:\n- Cost amount ($20,000) + Profit ($14,779.88) = $34,779.88 ✓\n- Total before tax ($33,040.89) + Tax ($1,738.99) = $34,779.88 ✓\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-05', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-25', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '34779.88', 'Recorded price': '34747.5', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240105015'} }\n```",
