Looking at transaction IDs with duplicate entries (like Initial20231231001) - these appear to be intentional splits across different asset categories\n2. Checking for Purchase transactions where the recorded amount doesn't match quantity Ã— price\n3. Examining Sale transactions for calculation errors in tax, profit, and after-tax amounts\n4. Looking for missing required fields or clear inconsistencies\n5. Checking specifically for approver fields that are missing or inconsistent with invoice details\n\nI've identified an issue with the transaction \"Expense20240110001\". The invoice states this transaction was prepared by Senior Staff and should have Director as the approver, but the recorded_approver field is empty.\n\nAlso, for transaction \"Expense20240115001\", the administrative expenses transaction shows that the approver field is empty but the invoice states it was approved by Director.\n\nLet me verify these findings against the invoice text:\n\nFor Expense20240110001:\n\"On January 10, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sales Expenses, totaling $5999.52. The payment_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid. This transaction was prepared by Senior Staff, and the approver is Director.\"\n\nFor Expense20240115001 (for the Administrative Expenses entry):\n\"On January 15, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Administrative Expenses, totaling $29391.07. The payment_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid. This transaction was prepared by Senior Staff, and the approver is Director.\"\n\nBased on my analysis, both of these transactions have missing approvers in their records, while the invoice clearly states they should have \"Director\" as the approver.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": \"Director\", \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Expense20240110001\"}}\n```",
