The recorded category is \"Administrative Expenses\" but the invoice description and transaction ID both indicate this should be a \"Sale\" transaction.\n\n2. The recorded date is \"2024-01-15\" but the invoice description states \"On January 10, 2024...\"\n\n3. The recorded amount is $18,628.46 but the invoice description states \"totaling $17,440.81\"\n\nLet me verify these inconsistencies against the invoice text:\n- Invoice states: \"On January 10, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $17440.81, totaling $17440.81\"\n- But record shows: Administrative Expenses on 2024-01-15 with amount $18,628.46\n\nThis is clearly a case where the transaction type, date, and amount have been incorrectly recorded compared to what's stated in the invoice.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Administrative Expenses', 'Original date': '2024-01-10', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-15', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '1.0', 'Recorded quantity': '1.0', 'Original price': '17440.81', 'Recorded price': '17440.81', 'Original receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Original amount': '17440.81', 'Recorded amount': '18628.46', 'Original tax': '872.04', 'Recorded tax': '872.04', 'Original profit': '7440.81', 'Recorded profit': '7440.81', 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240110041'} }\n```",
