From Balance Sheet: Accounts Receivable (amounts owed to the entity for goods/services sold on credit)\n2. From Income Statement: Financial Expenses (financing costs incurred by the enterprise)\n3. From Cash Flow Statement: Purchase of Fixed Assets (cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment)\n\nLet me identify these values in each statement:\n\n1. Looking at the Balance Sheet, I find \"Accounts Receivable\" with an End_amount of 12792007.89\n\n2. In the Income Statement, I find \"Financial Expenses\" with an Amount of 297417.97\n\n3. In the Cash Flow Statement, I find \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an Amount of 2670827.47\n\nTherefore, the three values I need to extract are:\n- value1: 12792007.89 (Accounts Receivable)\n- value2: 297417.97 (Financial Expenses)\n- value3: 2670827.47 (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '12792007.89', 'value2': '297417.97', 'value3': '2670827.47'}}\n```",
