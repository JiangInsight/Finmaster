The company did not purchase any goods or services on credit, or if they did, they paid for them within the same period.\n\nSince there was no addition to the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period, the value is $0.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'} }\n```",
