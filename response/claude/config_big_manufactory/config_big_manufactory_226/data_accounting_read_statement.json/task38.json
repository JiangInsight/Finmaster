Accounts receivable represents money owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered but not yet paid for.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement provided:\n- \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" shows a value of -12792007.89\n\nThe negative sign indicates an increase in accounts receivable (meaning more money is owed to the company, which is a use of cash in the cash flow statement). Since the task asks for the decrease in amounts owed, this is indeed the relevant line item, but the negative value indicates an increase rather than a decrease.\n\nNevertheless, this is the correct line item that tracks changes in amounts owed to the entity, and the value is -12792007.89.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-12792007.89'}}\n```",
