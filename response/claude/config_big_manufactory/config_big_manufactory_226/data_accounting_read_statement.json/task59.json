From the Balance Sheet:\n   - Interest Receivable: End_amount = 18176.52\n   - This represents interest accrued but not yet received\n\n2. From the Cash Flow Statement:\n   - Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents = -21595289.91\n   - This is the net addition (in this case a reduction) in cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nThe two specific values I need to extract are:\n- Interest accrued but not yet received: 18176.52\n- Net addition in cash and cash equivalents: -21595289.91\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '18176.52', 'value2': '-21595289.91'} }\n```",
