This appears as \"Bank Deposits\" with an end amount of 385137.69 on 2024-02-05.\n\n## Income Statement\nFor income earned from financial assets, I need to find a line item related to interest or financial income. This appears as \"Interest Income\" with an amount of 18176.52 on 2024-02-05.\n\nTherefore, the two values I need to extract are:\n- Bank Deposits: 385137.69\n- Interest Income: 18176.52\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '385137.69', 'value2': '18176.52'}}\n```",
