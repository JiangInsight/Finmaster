Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares\n\nLet me examine each financial statement:\n\n## Balance Sheet\n- For capital contributed by shareholders: \"Paid-in Capital\" with End_amount of 28000000.00\n- For the amount owed for goods/services (accounts payable): \"Accounts Payable\" with End_amount of 0.00\n\n## Income Statement\n- For profit or loss before tax expense: \"Profit Before Tax\" with Amount of 2858088.75\n\n## Cash Flow Statement\n- I can verify the accounts payable change here: \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with Amount of 0.00\n\nBased on my analysis, the three values are:\n1. Paid-in Capital: 28000000.00\n2. Profit Before Tax: 2858088.75\n3. Accounts Payable: 0.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28000000.00', 'value2': '2858088.75', 'value3': '0.00'} }\n```",
