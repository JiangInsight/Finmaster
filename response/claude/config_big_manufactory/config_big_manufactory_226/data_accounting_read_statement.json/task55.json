In the balance sheet, I see \"Taxes Payable\" with an end amount of 1,015,922.54 as of 2024-02-05.\n\n2. In the income statement, I find \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of 1,015,922.54 for 2024-02-05.\n\n3. In the cash flow statement, there is \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" showing 1,015,922.54.\n\nThe tax expense line in the income statement represents the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay for the reporting period. This is the most appropriate item to answer the question.\n\nTherefore, the value of the total tax amount is 1,015,922.54.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1015922.54'} }\n```",
