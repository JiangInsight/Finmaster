This represents the change in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\nTo decompose this into component sub-items, I need to identify the relevant financial data that makes up this value. From the statement, I can see:\n\n1. The \"Beginning Balance\" of Cash and Cash Equivalents is 20000000.00\n2. The \"Ending Balance\" of Cash and Cash Equivalents is -1595289.91\n\nThese two values are the sub-items that, when subtracted (Ending - Beginning), give us the Net Increase value:\n-1595289.91 - 20000000.00 = -21595289.91\n\nTherefore:\n- The value of the net addition (actually a decrease) is -21595289.91\n- Sub-item value1 is the Beginning Balance: 20000000.00\n- Sub-item value2 is the Ending Balance: -1595289.91\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-21595289.91', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '20000000.00', 'sub_item value2': '-1595289.91'}}}\n```",
