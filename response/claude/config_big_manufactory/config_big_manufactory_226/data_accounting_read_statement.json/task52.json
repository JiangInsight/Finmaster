I'll examine the balance sheet to find the relevant line items.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, I see a line item called \"Paid-in Capital\" which represents the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares. This is exactly what I'm looking for.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Paid-in Capital: 28000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- End Paid-in Capital: 28000000.00 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\nThe Paid-in Capital remained unchanged during this period, showing that there were no additional capital contributions or reductions during this timeframe.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '28000000.00', 'end value': '28000000.00'}}\n```",
