Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period\n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole\n\nLet me analyze the income statement:\n\n1. Total income from ordinary activities would be represented by \"Total Revenue\" = 20318450.67\n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold would be represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\" = 14600000.00\n3. Costs of general management and administration would be represented by \"Administrative Expenses\" = 1127712.35\n\nThese line items correspond to the same ones identified in the example.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '20318450.67', 'value2': '14600000.00', 'value3': '1127712.35'}}\n```",
