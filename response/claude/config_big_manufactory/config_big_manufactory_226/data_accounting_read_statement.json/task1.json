To get the total cash:\n\nFor the initial value (2023-12-31):\nCash on Hand + Bank Deposits = 5,000,000.00 + 15,000,000.00 = 20,000,000.00\n\nFor the end value (2024-02-05):\nCash on Hand + Bank Deposits = -1,980,427.60 + 385,137.69 = -1,595,289.91\n\nHowever, I notice Cash on Hand has a negative value at the end date, which is unusual. In this case, I'll still combine both values as that represents the total cash position.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '20000000.00', 'end value': '-1595289.91'}}\n```",
