                        "content": "I need to calculate the Free Cash Flow (FCF) and Current Assets Turnover Ratio based on the financial statements provided.\n\n## Step 1: Calculate FCF\nFree Cash Flow can be calculated from the cash flow statement. FCF is essentially the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities minus Capital Expenditures.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$18,924,462.44\n- Capital Expenditures (Purchase of Fixed Assets) = $2,670,827.47\n\nFCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures\nFCF = -$18,924,462.44 - $2,670,827.47 = -$21,595,289.91\n\nI can verify this matches the \"Net Increase\" in Cash and Cash Equivalents shown in the cash flow statement.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Current Assets Turnover Ratio\nThe Current Assets Turnover Ratio is calculated as:\nRevenue / Average Current Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = $20,318,450.67\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Current Assets = $20,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Current Assets = $20,314,894.50\n\nAverage Current Assets = ($20,000,000.00 + $20,314,894.50) / 2 = $20,157,447.25\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = $20,318,450.67 / $20,157,447.25 = 1.01\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-21595289.91', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '1.01'} }\n```",
