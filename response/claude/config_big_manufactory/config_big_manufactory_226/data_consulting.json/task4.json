Total Liabilities as of 2024-02-05:\n   - The balance sheet shows \"Total Current Liabilities\" of $1,015,922.54\n   - There appear to be no non-current liabilities listed\n   - Therefore, Total Liabilities = $1,015,922.54\n\n2. Total Shareholders' Equity as of 2024-02-05:\n   - \"Total Owner's Equity\" is $29,842,166.21\n\n3. Calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio:\n   - Debt to Equity Ratio = $1,015,922.54 รท $29,842,166.21\n   - Debt to Equity Ratio = 0.03404\n\n4. Round to 2 decimal places:\n   - Debt to Equity Ratio = 0.03\n\nTherefore, the Debt to Equity Ratio as of 2024-02-05 is 0.03.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03'}}\n```",
