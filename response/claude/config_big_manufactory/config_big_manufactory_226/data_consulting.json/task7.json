Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -18,924,462.44\n2. Capital Expenditures (Purchase of Fixed Assets): 2,670,827.47\n\nThe FCF calculation would be:\nFCF = -18,924,462.44 - 2,670,827.47 = -21,595,289.91\n\nI can verify this is correct by looking at the \"Net Increase\" in Cash and Cash Equivalents, which is also -21,595,289.91.\n\nTherefore, the Free Cash Flow (FCF) is -21,595,289.91.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-21595289.91'}}\n```",
