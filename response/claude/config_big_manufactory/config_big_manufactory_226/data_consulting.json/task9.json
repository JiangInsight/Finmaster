                        "content": "I need to calculate the Cash to Current Debt Ratio based on the financial statements provided.\n\nThe Cash to Current Debt Ratio is calculated by dividing Cash and Cash Equivalents by the Current Liabilities:\n\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities\n\nLet's identify these values from the balance sheet:\n\n1. Cash and Cash Equivalents:\n   - Cash on Hand: -1,980,427.60\n   - Bank Deposits: 385,137.69\n   - Total Cash and Cash Equivalents: -1,980,427.60 + 385,137.69 = -1,595,289.91\n\n2. Current Liabilities:\n   - Total Current Liabilities: 1,015,922.54\n\nTherefore:\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = -1,595,289.91 / 1,015,922.54 = -1.57\n\nHowever, I should note that a negative cash balance is unusual in practical accounting. This suggests the company has an overdraft situation. For ratio analysis purposes, we report the actual mathematical result.\n\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = -1.57, rounded to 2 decimal places.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '-1.57'}}\n```",
