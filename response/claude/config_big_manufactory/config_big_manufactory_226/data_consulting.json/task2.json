Current Assets at the end of the reporting period: $20,314,894.50\n2. Inventory at the end of the reporting period: $9,100,000.00\n3. Current Liabilities at the end of the reporting period: $1,015,922.54\n\nNow I'll calculate the Quick Ratio:\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\nQuick Ratio = ($20,314,894.50 - $9,100,000.00) / $1,015,922.54\nQuick Ratio = $11,214,894.50 / $1,015,922.54\nQuick Ratio = 11.038\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: 11.04\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '11.04'}}\n```",
