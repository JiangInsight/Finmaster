                        "content": "I'll calculate each ratio step by step, using the financial statements provided.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow generated from operations.\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -18,924,462.44\n- Total Current Liabilities: 1,015,922.54\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -18,924,462.44 / 1,015,922.54 = -18.63\n\n## 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay its debt using operating cash flow.\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -18,924,462.44\n- Total Liabilities (Debt): 1,015,922.54\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -18,924,462.44 / 1,015,922.54 = -18.63\n\n## 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period.\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 14,600,000.00\n- Average Inventory: (0 + 9,100,000.00) / 2 = 4,550,000.00\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = 14,600,000.00 / 4,550,000.00 = 3.21\n\n## 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio shows the proportion of equity and debt used to finance assets.\n- Total Liabilities: 1,015,922.54\n- Total Owner's Equity: 29,842,166.21\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = 1,015,922.54 / 29,842,166.21 = 0.03\n\n## 5. Quick Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n- Quick Assets = Total Current Assets - Inventory = 20,314,894.50 - 9,100,000.00 = 11,214,894.50\n- Total Current Liabilities: 1,015,922.54\n- Quick Ratio = 11,214,894.50 / 1,015,922.54 = 11.04\n\n## 6. Current Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations.\n- Total Current Assets: 20,314,894.50\n- Total Current Liabilities: 1,015,922.54\n- Current Ratio = 20,314,894.50 / 1,015,922.54 = 20.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-18.63', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-18.63', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '3.21', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Quick Ratio': '11.04', 'Current Ratio': '20.00'}}\n```",
