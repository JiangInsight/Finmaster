                        "content": "I need to calculate the Return on Equity (ROE) based on the financial statements provided. ROE measures how efficiently a company uses its equity to generate profits.\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\nROE = Net Profit / Average Shareholders' Equity × 100%\n\nLet me solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll identify the Net Profit from the income statement:\n   Net Profit = $1,842,166.21\n\n2. Next, I need to calculate the Average Shareholders' Equity:\n   - Beginning Shareholders' Equity (2023-12-31) = $28,000,000.00\n   - Ending Shareholders' Equity (2024-02-05) = $29,842,166.21\n   - Average Shareholders' Equity = ($28,000,000.00 + $29,842,166.21) / 2 = $28,921,083.11\n\n3. Now I can calculate ROE:\n   ROE = $1,842,166.21 / $28,921,083.11 × 100% = 6.37%\n\nTherefore, the Return on Equity (ROE) is 6.37%.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '6.37%'}}\n```",
