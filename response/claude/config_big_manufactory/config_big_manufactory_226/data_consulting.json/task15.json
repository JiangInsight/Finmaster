                        "content": "I need to calculate the Current Assets Turnover Ratio, which measures how efficiently a company is using its current assets to generate revenue.\n\nThe formula for Current Assets Turnover Ratio is:\nNet Sales (Revenue) / Average Current Assets\n\nLet me extract the relevant information from the financial statements:\n\n1. Net Sales (Revenue) = $20,318,450.67 (from income statement)\n\n2. Average Current Assets = (Beginning Current Assets + Ending Current Assets) / 2\n   - Beginning Current Assets = $20,000,000.00 (from balance sheet initial amount)\n   - Ending Current Assets = $20,314,894.50 (from balance sheet end amount)\n   - Average Current Assets = ($20,000,000.00 + $20,314,894.50) / 2 = $20,157,447.25\n\n3. Current Assets Turnover Ratio = $20,318,450.67 / $20,157,447.25 = 1.008\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 1.01\n\nTherefore, the Current Assets Turnover Ratio is 1.01, meaning the company generates $1.01 in sales for every dollar invested in current assets.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '1.01'} }\n```",
