                        "content": "I need to calculate several financial ratios based on the given financial statements. Let me tackle each ratio step by step.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis ratio is calculated as: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -18,924,462.44\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n- Ratio = -18,924,462.44 / 1,015,922.54 = -18.63\n\n## 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio is calculated as: Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n- Total Owner's Equity = 29,842,166.21\n- Ratio = 1,015,922.54 / 29,842,166.21 = 0.034\n\n## 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio is calculated as: Total Revenue / Average Total Assets\n- Total Revenue = 20,318,450.67\n- Average Total Assets = (Initial Total Assets + End Total Assets) / 2\n- Average Total Assets = (28,000,000 + 30,858,088.75) / 2 = 29,429,044.38\n- Ratio = 20,318,450.67 / 29,429,044.38 = 0.69\n\n## 4. Quick Ratio\nThis ratio is calculated as: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n- Current Assets = 20,314,894.50\n- Inventory = 9,100,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n- Quick Ratio = (20,314,894.50 - 9,100,000.00) / 1,015,922.54 = 11,214,894.50 / 1,015,922.54 = 11.04\n\n## 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio already calculated = -18.63\n\n## 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\nThis ratio is calculated as: Net Profit / Average Owner's Equity\n- Net Profit = 1,842,166.21\n- Average Owner's Equity = (Initial Owner's Equity + End Owner's Equity) / 2\n- Average Owner's Equity = (28,000,000 + 29,842,166.21) / 2 = 28,921,083.11\n- ROE = 1,842,166.21 / 28,921,083.11 = 0.0637 = 6.37%\n\n## 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio is calculated as: Total Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable\n- Total Revenue = 20,318,450.67\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Initial Accounts Receivable + End Accounts Receivable) / 2\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 12,792,007.89) / 2 = 6,396,003.95\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 20,318,450.67 / 6,396,003.95 = 3.18\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-18.63', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.69', 'Quick Ratio': '11.04', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-18.63', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '6.37%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.18'} }\n```",
