The formula is:\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nStep 1: Find the Net Credit Sales.\nFrom the income statement, the Main Business Revenue (which represents the sales) is $20,318,450.67.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Average Accounts Receivable.\nBeginning Accounts Receivable (from Initial_amount column) = $0.00\nEnding Accounts Receivable (from End_amount column) = $12,792,007.89\nAverage Accounts Receivable = ($0.00 + $12,792,007.89) / 2 = $6,396,003.95\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio.\nAccounts Receivable Turnover = $20,318,450.67 / $6,396,003.95 = 3.18\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: 3.18\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.18'} }\n```",
