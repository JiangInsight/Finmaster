The formula is:\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nStep 1: Identify the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities.\nFrom the cash flow statement, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -18,924,462.44\n\nStep 2: Identify the Total Current Liabilities.\nFrom the balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities at the end date = 1,015,922.54\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -18,924,462.44 / 1,015,922.54 = -18.63\n\nStep 4: Round to 2 decimal places.\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -18.63\n\nThis negative ratio indicates that the company is not generating enough cash from its operations to cover its current liabilities. In fact, operations are consuming cash rather than generating it, which could be a concern for short-term financial health.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-18.63'} }\n```",
