There are no non-current liabilities listed, so this represents the total liabilities.\n\nStep 2: Identify the Total Assets at the end of the reporting period.\nFrom the balance sheet, \"Total Assets\" is $30,858,088.75.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio.\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $1,015,922.54 / $30,858,088.75\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 0.0329 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\nStep 4: Format the ratio to 2 decimal places as shown in the example.\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 0.03\n\nTherefore, the Debt to Asset Ratio is 0.03.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03'}}\n```",
