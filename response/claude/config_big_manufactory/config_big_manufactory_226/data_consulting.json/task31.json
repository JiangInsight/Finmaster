                        "content": "I need to calculate several financial ratios based on the given financial statements. Let me go through each ratio step by step.\n\n## 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\nFormula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nFrom the income statement, we see:\n- Revenue = $20,318,450.67\n\nFor Average Accounts Receivable:\n- Beginning AR = $0\n- Ending AR = $12,792,007.89\n- Average AR = ($0 + $12,792,007.89) / 2 = $6,396,003.95\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $20,318,450.67 / $6,396,003.95 = 3.18\n\n## 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with its operating cash flow.\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Operating Cash Flow = -$18,924,462.44\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Liabilities = $1,015,922.54\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$18,924,462.44 / $1,015,922.54 = -18.63\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio calculated above = -18.63\n\n## 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\nFormula: Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Sales = $20,318,450.67\n\nFor Average Total Assets:\n- Beginning Total Assets = $28,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets = $30,858,088.75\n- Average Total Assets = ($28,000,000.00 + $30,858,088.75) / 2 = $29,429,044.38\n\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = $20,318,450.67 / $29,429,044.38 = 0.69\n\n## 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's financial leverage.\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = $1,015,922.54\n- Total Equity = $29,842,166.21\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $1,015,922.54 / $29,842,166.21 = 0.03\n\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.18', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-18.63', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-18.63', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.69', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03'}}",
