The cost amount for this transaction was $60000.00, with a tax amount of $3715.01, leading to a total amount due of $70585.24. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\nBut the recorded values show:\n- Quantity: 2.0 (should be 3.0)\n- Unit price: $25021.15 (should be $24766.75)\n- Total amount: $49533.5 (should be $74300.25)\n- Tax amount: $81724.53 (should be $3715.01)\n\nNext, let's check Sale20240128026:\nThe invoice states: \"On January 28, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $707188.94, totaling $707188.94.
