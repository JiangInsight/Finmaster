Mathematical consistency (amount = unit price Ã— quantity)\n2. Profit calculation (recorded_profit = recorded_amount - recorded_cost_amount)\n3. Tax amount calculations\n4. After-tax amount calculations\n5. Any other discrepancies between invoice text and recorded fields\n\nLooking at transaction Sale20240204037, I notice a discrepancy:\n\nThe invoice states:\n\"On February 04, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $1056960.17, totaling $1056960.17. The cost amount for this transaction was $800000.00, with a tax amount of $52848.01, leading to a total amount due of $1004112.16. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nBased on this invoice, the profit should be: $1056960.17 - $800000.00 = $256960.17\n\nHowever, the recorded_profit shows: $243768.08\n\nThis is clearly an inconsistency between the calculated profit and the recorded profit.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": \"256960.17\", \"Recorded profit\": \"243768.08\", \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240204037\"}}\n```",
