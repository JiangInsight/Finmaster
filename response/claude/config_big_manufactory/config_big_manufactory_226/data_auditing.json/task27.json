The invoice is considered the reliable source, so these fields are incorrect in the transaction record.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Purchase', 'Recorded category': 'Administrative Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '1000000.0', 'Recorded price': '905391.7', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '1000000.0', 'Recorded amount': '1070290.74', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Purchase20231231004'} }\n```",
