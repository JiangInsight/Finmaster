Recorded amount shows 0.0, but the invoice states the total amount is $2,091,831.76\n2. Recorded quantity shows 0.0, but the invoice mentions 1.0 unit\n3. Recorded payment/receipt_status is \"Unpaid\" but the invoice states \"paid\"\n4. Recorded profit shows $601,220.74, but if I calculate it based on the invoice information:\n   - Total amount: $2,091,831.76\n   - Cost amount: $1,500,000.00\n   - Profit should be: $2,091,831.76 - $1,500,000.00 = $591,831.76\n   \nThe profit calculated from the invoice doesn't match the recorded profit of $601,220.74, showing another discrepancy.\n\nI'll verify these findings with the information provided in the invoice field: \"On January 30, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $2091831.76, totaling $2091831.76. The cost amount for this transaction was $1500000.00, with a tax amount of $104591.59, leading to a total amount due of $1987240.17. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, I can identify three clear inconsistencies:\n\n1. The recorded quantity (0.0) doesn't match the invoice (1.0)\n2. The recorded payment/receipt_status (\"Unpaid\") doesn't match the invoice (\"paid\")\n3. The recorded profit ($601,220.74) doesn't match what should be calculated from the invoice ($591,831.76)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '1.0', 'Recorded quantity': '0.0', 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '2091831.76', 'Recorded amount': '0.0', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': '591831.76', 'Recorded profit': '601220.74', 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240130027'} }\n```",
