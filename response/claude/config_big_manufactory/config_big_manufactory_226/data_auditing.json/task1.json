I'll pay special attention to the invoice text, which is generally considered more reliable, and compare it with the recorded fields.\n\nLooking at transaction ID `Expense20240202001`, I notice a potential issue:\n- The recorded type is `Financial Expenses`\n- But the invoice states: \"On February 02, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Administrative Expenses, totaling $91158.78.\"\n\nThis is a clear discrepancy between the recorded transaction type (Financial Expenses) and what's stated in the invoice (Administrative Expenses). Since the invoice is considered more reliable, this appears to be an error in the recorded type field.\n\nNo other fields for this transaction appear to be inconsistent with the invoice description.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Recorded category\": \"Financial Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Expense20240202001\"} }\n```",
