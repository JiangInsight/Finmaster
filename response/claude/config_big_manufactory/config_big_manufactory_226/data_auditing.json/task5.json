First, I'll look at `Sale20240128026` since I can see it's already flagged in the risk_issues column:\n   - The recorded quantity is 0.0\n   - However, the invoice states \"consisting of 1.0 units\"\n   - The recorded amount is 0.0, which is inconsistent with the invoice amount of $707,188.94\n   - This is a clear inconsistency between the recorded data and invoice\n\n2. I need to check if there are any other inconsistencies in other transactions:\n   - Looking at Initial20231231001 entries, they appear consistent\n   - Checking Purchase transactions, they appear to match their invoices\n   - Going through Sale transactions...\n\nI found a significant discrepancy in Sale20240128026 where the recorded quantity is 0.0 but the invoice clearly states 1.0 units. This inconsistency also affects the recorded amount which is showing as $0.00 instead of the $707,188.94 mentioned in the invoice.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"0.0\", \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"707188.94\", \"Recorded amount\": \"0.0\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240128026\"}}\n```",
