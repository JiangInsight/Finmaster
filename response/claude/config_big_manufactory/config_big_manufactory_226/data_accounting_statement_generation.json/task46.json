Initial cash deposit on 2023-12-31: $5,000,000.00\n2. Initial bank deposit on 2023-12-31: $15,000,000.00\n\nTo calculate the beginning balance for the cash flow statement, I need to sum these two amounts:\n$5,000,000.00 + $15,000,000.00 = $20,000,000.00\n\nThis represents the total cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the reporting period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '20000000.00'}}\n```",
