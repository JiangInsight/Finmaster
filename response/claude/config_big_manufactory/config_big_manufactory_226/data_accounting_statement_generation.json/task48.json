From transfers from cash to bank: $8,000,000.00 (as calculated above)\n\n### Bank Outflows:\n1. For purchases with bank transfer payment:\n   - Purchase 2023-12-31 #002: $3,000,000.00\n   - Purchase 2023-12-31 #003: $1,600,000.00\n   - Purchase 2023-12-31 #006: $2,000,000.00\n   - Purchase 2023-12-31 #007: $2,000,000.00\n   - Purchase 2023-12-31 #012: $1,000,000.00\n   Total bank transfers for purchases: $9,600,000.00\n\n2.

For transfers from bank to cash: $9,000,000.00 (as calculated above)\n\n### Net Change Calculation:\n1. Net change in cash:\n   - Initial cash: $5,000,000.00\n   - Cash inflows: $7,526,442.78 (sales) + $9,000,000.00 (transfers from bank) = $16,526,442.78\n   - Cash outflows: $12,100,000.00 (purchases) + $2,541,748.63 (expenses) + $8,000,000.00 (transfers to bank) = $22,641,748.63\n   - Net change in cash: $5,000,000.00 + $16,526,442.78 - $22,641,748.63 = -$1,115,305.85\n\n2. Net change in bank:\n   - Initial bank: $15,000,000.00\n   - Bank inflows: $8,000,000.00 (transfers from cash)\n   - Bank outflows: $9,600,000.00 (purchases) + $2,670,827.47 (fixed assets) + $9,000,000.00 (transfers to cash) = $21,270,827.47\n   - Net change in bank: $15,000,000.00 + $8,000,000.00 - $21,270,827.47 = $1,729,172.53\n\n3. Total net increase in cash and cash equivalents:\n   - Net change in cash: -$1,115,305.85\n   - Net change in bank: $1,729,172.53\n   - Total net increase: -$1,115,305.85 + $1,729,172.53 = $613,866.68\n\nWait, let me double-check this calculation by a different approach:\n\nInitial total cash and equivalents: $20,000,000.00\nFinal cash balance = Initial cash + Cash inflows - Cash outflows = $5,000,000.00 + $16,526,442.78 - $22,641,748.63 = -$1,115,305.85\n\nFinal bank balance = Initial bank + Bank inflows - Bank outflows = $15,000,000.00 + $8,000,000.00 - $21,270,827.47 = $1,729,172.53\n\nFinal total cash and equivalents: -$1,115,305.85 + $1,729,172.53 = $613,866.68\n\nSo the net increase in cash and cash equivalents is: $613,866.68\n\nActually, I need to verify my calculations again. Let me look at the transactions more carefully.\n\nUpon careful review, I realize I may have missed some transactions. Let me recalculate more methodically:\n\nInitial balance:\n- Cash: $5,000,000.00\n- Bank: $15,000,000.00\n- Total: $20,000,000.00\n\nEnding balance:\n- Cash: $5,000,000.00 (initial) - $12,100,000.00 (purchases) - $2,541,748.63 (expenses) + $7,526,442.78 (sales) + $9,000,000.00 (in transfers) - $8,000,000.00 (out transfers) = -$1,115,305.85\n- Bank: $15,000,000.00 (initial) - $9,600,000.00 (purchases) - $2,670,827.47 (fixed assets) + $8,000,000.00 (in transfers) - $9,000,000.00 (out transfers) = $1,729,172.53\n- Total ending: -$1,115,305.85 + $1,729,172.53 = $613,866.68\n\nTherefore, net increase = $613,866.68 - $20,000,000.00 = -$19,386,133.32\n\nWait, that's not right. Let me recalculate:\n\nNet increase = Ending total - Initial total = $613,866.68 - $20,000,000.00 = -$19,386,133.32\n\nLet me verify this calculation once more to ensure accuracy:\n\nInitial total: $5,000,000.00 + $15,000,000.00 = $20,000,000.00\nEnding total: -$1,115,305.85 + $1,729,172.53 = $613,866.68\nNet increase: $613,866.68 - $20,000,000.00 = -$19,386,133.32\n\nTherefore, the final net increase in cash and cash equivalents is -$19,386,133.32.\n\nActually, I need to double-check my calculation of the ending balance again. I think there may have been an error in my reasoning.\n\nLet me recalculate from the beginning:\n\nCash Starting Balance: $5,000,000.00\n+ Cash from Sales: $7,526,442.78\n+ Cash from Bank Transfers: $9,000,000.00\n- Cash for Purchases: $12,100,000.00\n- Cash for Expenses: $2,541,748.63\n- Cash to Bank Transfers: $8,000,000.00\n= Cash Ending Balance: -$1,115,305.85\n\nBank Starting Balance: $15,000,000.00\n+ Bank from Cash Transfers: $8,000,000.00\n- Bank for Purchases: $9,600,000.00\n- Bank for Fixed Assets: $2,670,827.47\n- Bank to Cash Transfers: $9,000,000.00\n= Bank Ending Balance: $1,729,172.53\n\nTotal Starting Balance: $20,000,000.00\nTotal Ending Balance: -$1,115,305.85 + $1,729,172.53 = $613,866.68\nNet Increase: $613,866.68 - $20,000,000.00 = -$19,386,133.32\n\nTherefore, the net increase in cash and cash equivalents is -$19,386,133.32\n\nI need to be careful here. The net increase is the ending balance minus the starting balance, so:\nNet Increase = $613,866.68 - $20,000,000.00 = -$19,386,133.32\n\nThe negative value indicates a decrease rather than an increase.\n\nLet me make sure I've included all relevant transactions. After careful review, I confirm my calculation is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Increase': '-19386133.32'}}\n```",
