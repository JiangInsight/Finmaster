All the purchases from this date show either \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" as the payment method, and they're marked \"Paid\".\n\nLooking at all subsequent transactions up to 2024-02-05:\n- I don't see any transactions with \"Account Payable\" as the payment method.\n- I also don't see any transactions that would indicate payments of previously established accounts payable.\n\nThis suggests that this company didn't use accounts payable for any purchases during this period. All purchases were paid immediately with cash or bank transfers. The company doesn't appear to have any debt to suppliers.\n\nHowever, I should double-check all transactions carefully to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nAfter a thorough review, I find that there are no transactions using accounts payable as a payment method. All purchases are marked as \"Paid\" through either \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\".\n\nTherefore:\n- The initial accounts payable value as of 2023-12-31 is 0.00\n- The ending accounts payable value as of 2024-02-05 is 0.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accounts Payable End Value': '0.00'} }\n```",
