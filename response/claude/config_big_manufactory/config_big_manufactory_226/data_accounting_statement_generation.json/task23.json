                        "content": "I need to calculate the final cost of goods sold (COGS) based on the transaction data provided.\n\nTo find the COGS, I'll identify all sales transactions and sum up their associated cost amounts.\n\nFirst, let me identify all the sale transactions by looking for rows with \"Sale\" in the type column:\n\n1. Sale20240105004: Cost amount = 1,000,000.00\n2. Sale20240107006: Cost amount = 1,500,000.00\n3. Sale20240111008: Cost amount = 500,000.00\n4. Sale20240114011: Cost amount = 1,000,000.00\n5. Sale20240117015: Cost amount = 800,000.00\n6. Sale20240118016: Cost amount = 1,500,000.00\n7. Sale20240119018: Cost amount = 500,000.00\n8. Sale20240121020: Cost amount = 500,000.00\n9. Sale20240125022: Cost amount = 500,000.00\n10. Sale20240128026: Cost amount = 500,000.00\n11. Sale20240130027: Cost amount = 1,500,000.00\n12. Sale20240131029: Cost amount = 1,000,000.00\n13. Sale20240201031: Cost amount = 1,500,000.00\n14. Sale20240203034: Cost amount = 1,500,000.00\n15. Sale20240204037: Cost amount = 800,000.00\n\nNow, I'll sum up all these cost amounts:\n1,000,000.00 + 1,500,000.00 + 500,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 + 800,000.00 + 1,500,000.00 + 500,000.00 + 500,000.00 + 500,000.00 + 500,000.00 + 1,500,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 + 1,500,000.00 + 1,500,000.00 + 800,000.00 = 14,600,000.00\n\nTherefore, the total Cost of Goods Sold is 14,600,000.00.\n\nWait, I need to verify this by double-checking the problem definition. I need to ensure I'm only including relevant sales (for example, only within a certain period if specified).\n\nLooking back at the problem description, I don't see any specific time period restriction. The data seems to include transactions from December 2023 through February 2024, and I've included all sales transactions in this period.\n\nLet me format the answer as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cost of Goods Sold': '14600000.00'}}\n```",
