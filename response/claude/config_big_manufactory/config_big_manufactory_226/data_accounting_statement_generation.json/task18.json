Sum up all sales revenues\n2. Sum up all expenses (including purchases, depreciation, etc.)\n3. Calculate the difference (profit or loss)\n\n#### Sales (Revenues):\nLet me identify all the sales transactions:\n- Sale20240105004: 1,463,032.36\n- Sale20240107006: 2,159,586.87\n- Sale20240111008: 749,601.75\n- Sale20240114011: 1,332,686.65\n- Sale20240117015: 1,147,555.96\n- Sale20240118016: 2,156,466.82\n- Sale20240119018: 668,808.14\n- Sale20240121020: 664,435.83\n- Sale20240125022: 674,830.39\n- Sale20240128026: 707,188.94\n- Sale20240130027: 2,091,831.76\n- Sale20240131029: 1,417,458.33\n- Sale20240201031: 1,999,604.61\n- Sale20240203034: 2,028,402.09\n- Sale20240204037: 1,056,960.17\n\nTotal Sales: 20,318,450.67\n\n#### Interest Receivables (Additional Revenue):\nSum of all interest receivables: 14,723.63\n\nTotal Revenue: 20,333,174.30\n\n#### Expenses:\n- All Administrative Expenses transactions: 1,030,782.60\n- All Sales Expenses transactions: 1,178,691.01\n- All Financial Expenses transactions: 349,014.12\n- All Depreciation transactions: 127,633.22\n- All Purchases transactions: 22,700,000.00\n\nTotal Expenses: 25,386,120.95\n\n#### Net Profit/Loss:\nNet Profit/Loss = Total Revenue - Total Expenses\nNet Profit/Loss = 20,333,174.30 - 25,386,120.95 = -5,052,946.65\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the final owner's equity\nFinal Owner's Equity = Initial Owner's Equity + Net Profit/Loss\nFinal Owner's Equity = 28,000,000.00 + (-5,052,946.65) = 22,947,053.35\n\nTherefore:\n- Total Owner's Equity Initial Value: 28,000,000.00\n- Total Owner's Equity End Value: 22,947,053.35\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Owners Equity Initial Value': '28000000.00', 'Total Owners Equity End Value': '22947053.35'}}\n```",
