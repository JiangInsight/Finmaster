                        "content": "I'll solve this task by calculating the initial and final values of property, plant, and non-current assets based on the transaction data.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the initial value of non-current assets\nFrom the data, I can see that there's an initial fixed assets balance:\n```\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 8000000.0 | 8000000.0 |\n```\nSo the initial value of non-current assets is 8,000,000.00.\n\n## Step 2: Identify additional fixed asset purchases\nI need to look for any fixed asset purchases that should be added to the initial amount:\n\n```\n| FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 1262568.05 | 1262568.05 | ... | Heavy Machinery4 | Heavy Machinery |\n| FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 1408259.42 | 1408259.42 | ... | Industrial Facilities5 | Industrial Facilities |\n```\n\nSo I have additional fixed asset purchases totaling 1,262,568.05 + 1,408,259.42 = 2,670,827.47.\n\n## Step 3: Account for depreciation\nI need to subtract any depreciation from the asset value. There are two depreciation entries:\n\n```\n| Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45745.8 | 45745.8 |\n| Depreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | 2024-02-01 | 2024-02-01 | 81887.42000000001 | 81887.42000000001 |\n```\n\nTotal depreciation = 45,745.80 + 81,887.42 = 127,633.22\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final value of non-current assets\nInitial value + Additional purchases - Depreciation = Final value\n8,000,000.00 + 2,670,827.47 - 127,633.22 = 10,543,194.25\n\nHowever, I need to double-check this calculation against the example solution. \n\nLooking at the example solution, it seems the approach is to simply take the initial fixed asset value and add any fixed asset purchases, then subtract the depreciation to find the ending balance.\n\nInitial fixed assets: 8,000,000.00\nAdd fixed asset purchases: +2,670,827.47\nSubtract depreciation: -127,633.22\nFinal non-current assets: 10,543,194.25\n\nLet me format this according to the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '10543194.25'}}\n```",
