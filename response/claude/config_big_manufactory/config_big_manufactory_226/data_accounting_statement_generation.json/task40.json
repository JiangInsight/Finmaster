                        "content": "I'll solve this task by calculating the final inventory item in the cash flow statement.\n\nTo determine the (Increase) Decrease in Inventory for the cash flow statement, I need to:\n\n1. Calculate all inventory purchases in the period\n2. Calculate all inventory sales (at cost) in the period\n3. Find the net change by subtracting purchases from sales cost\n\nLet me analyze the data:\n\n### Step 1: Identify and sum up all inventory purchases\nLooking through the transactions, I need to find all rows with type \"Purchase\" and sum their amounts:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 1,500,000.00 (Heavy Equipment D)\n- Purchase20231231002: 3,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment D)\n- Purchase20231231003: 1,600,000.00 (Heavy Equipment B)\n- Purchase20231231004: 1,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment C)\n- Purchase20231231005: 1,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Purchase20231231006: 2,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment C)\n- Purchase20231231007: 2,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment C)\n- Purchase20231231008: 1,600,000.00 (Heavy Equipment B)\n- Purchase20231231009: 1,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Purchase20231231010: 1,500,000.00 (Heavy Equipment D)\n- Purchase20231231011: 500,000.00 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Purchase20231231012: 1,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Purchase20231231013: 3,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment D)\n- Purchase20231231014: 3,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment D)\n\nTotal inventory purchases = 23,700,000.00\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the cost of inventory sold\nFor this, I need to sum up the \"cost_amount\" column for all sales transactions:\n\n- Sale20240105004: 1,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment C)\n- Sale20240107006: 1,500,000.00 (Heavy Equipment D)\n- Sale20240111008: 500,000.00 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Sale20240114011: 1,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment C)\n- Sale20240117015: 800,000.00 (Heavy Equipment B)\n- Sale20240118016: 1,500,000.00 (Heavy Equipment D)\n- Sale20240119018: 500,000.00 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Sale20240121020: 500,000.00 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Sale20240125022: 500,000.00 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Sale20240128026: 500,000.00 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Sale20240130027: 1,500,000.00 (Heavy Equipment D)\n- Sale20240131029: 1,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment C)\n- Sale20240201031: 1,500,000.00 (Heavy Equipment D)\n- Sale20240203034: 1,500,000.00 (Heavy Equipment D)\n- Sale20240204037: 800,000.00 (Heavy Equipment B)\n\nTotal cost of inventory sold = 14,600,000.00\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the net change in inventory\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory = Cost of inventory sold - Inventory purchases\n= 14,600,000.00 - 23,700,000.00\n= -9,100,000.00\n\nA negative result indicates an increase in inventory levels, which means cash was used to increase inventory (a cash outflow for the cash flow statement).\n\nHowever, I need to double-check my calculations as the increase in inventory seems quite large.\n\nOn second review, I confirm that all purchases were made on 2023-12-31 and total 23,700,000.00, while sales happened throughout January and early February 2024, with the cost of goods sold totaling 14,600,000.00.\n\nThe result is an increase in inventory of 9,100,000.00, which appears as -9,100,000.00 in the cash flow statement (as it represents a cash outflow).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-9100000.00'}}\n```",
