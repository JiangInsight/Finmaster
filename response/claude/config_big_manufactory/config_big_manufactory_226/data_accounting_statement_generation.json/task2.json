Initial bank deposit value is recorded directly\n2. Bank deposits increase through:\n   - Bank transfers from customers (cash sales transferred to bank)\n   - Cash to bank transfers\n3. Bank deposits decrease through:\n   - Bank transfers for purchases\n   - Bank to cash transfers\n   - Bank payments for fixed assets\n\nLet's start by identifying the initial value, which is clearly stated in the data:\n\nInitial bank deposit: 15,000,000.00\n\nNow I'll track all transactions that affect the bank deposit balance:\n\n## Bank outflows:\n1. Purchase20231231002: Bank Transfer payment of 3,000,000.00\n2. Purchase20231231003: Bank Transfer payment of 1,600,000.00\n3. Purchase20231231006: Bank Transfer payment of 2,000,000.00\n4. Purchase20231231007: Bank Transfer payment of 2,000,000.00\n5. Purchase20231231012: Bank Transfer payment of 1,000,000.00\n6. FixedAsset20231231001 (Heavy Machinery4): Bank Transfer payment of 1,262,568.05\n7. FixedAsset20231231001 (Industrial Facilities5): Bank Transfer payment of 1,408,259.42\n\n## Bank inflows:\n1. Transfer20240119001: Bank to cash transfer of 1,000,000.00 (Outflow)\n2. Transfer20240130001: Bank to cash transfer of 1,000,000.00 (Outflow)\n3. Transfer20240130001: Cash to bank transfer of 1,000,000.00 (Inflow)\n4. Transfer20240131001: Bank to cash transfer of 1,000,000.00 (Outflow)\n5.

Transfer20240204001: Bank to cash transfer of 1,000,000.00 (Outflow)\n\nNow let me sum up the total changes to calculate the final bank deposit value:\n\nInitial bank deposit: 15,000,000.00\n\nTotal bank outflows:\n- Purchases and fixed assets: 3,000,000.00 + 1,600,000.00 + 2,000,000.00 + 2,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 + 1,262,568.05 + 1,408,259.42 = 12,270,827.47\n- Bank to cash transfers: 1,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 = 8,000,000.00\n\nTotal bank inflows:\n- Cash to bank transfers: 1,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 = 7,000,000.00\n\nCalculation of ending bank deposit balance:\n15,000,000.00 - 12,270,827.47 - 8,000,000.00 + 7,000,000.00 = 1,729,172.53\n\nTherefore:\n- Initial Bank Deposit: 15,000,000.00\n- Final Bank Deposit: 1,729,172.53\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Bank Deposits Initial Value': '15000000.00', 'Bank Deposits End Value': '1729172.53'} }\n```",
