First, I'll look for any fixed asset purchases or sales:\n   - FixedAsset20231231001: Fixed Assets Purchase - Heavy Machinery4 - amount: 1,262,568.05 (paid via Bank Transfer)\n   - FixedAsset20231231001: Fixed Assets Purchase - Industrial Facilities5 - amount: 1,408,259.42 (paid via Bank Transfer)\n\n2. There are no sales of fixed assets visible in the data.\n\nThe cash flow from investing activities consists of outflows for the purchase of fixed assets:\n- Fixed asset purchase: -1,262,568.05\n- Fixed asset purchase: -1,408,259.42\n\nTotal cash outflow from investing activities: -1,262,568.05 - 1,408,259.42 = -2,670,827.47\n\nTherefore, the net cash flow from investing activities is -2,670,827.47.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-2670827.47'}}\n```",
