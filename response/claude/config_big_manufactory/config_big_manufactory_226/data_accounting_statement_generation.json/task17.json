It's calculated as:\n\nRetained Earnings = Net Income - Dividends\n\nSince there's no information about dividends in the data, I'll focus on calculating the net income.\n\nStep 1: First, I need to determine the initial retained earnings.\nLooking at the initial entries (dated 2023-12-31), I don't see any explicit mention of initial retained earnings. Since this appears to be a new business setting up with initial cash, bank deposits, and fixed assets, the initial retained earnings should be zero.\n\nStep 2: Now I'll calculate the income and expenses to determine the final retained earnings.\n\nIncome:\n- Sales revenue\n- Interest income\n\nExpenses:\n- Cost of goods sold (from sales)\n- Administrative expenses\n- Sales expenses\n- Financial expenses\n- Depreciation\n\nLet me aggregate all these items:\n\nSales Revenue:\n1.

Sale20240204037: 1,056,960.17\nTotal Sales Revenue: 20,318,450.67\n\nInterest Income:\nSum of all Interest Receivables entries: 15,072.00\n\nCost of Goods Sold (from the cost_amount field in sales transactions):\nTotal COGS: 13,800,000.00\n\nExpenses:\nAdministrative Expenses: 1,340,179.45\nSales Expenses: 1,253,320.74\nFinancial Expenses: 365,718.79\nDepreciation: 127,633.22\n\nNet Income = Revenue - Expenses\nNet Income = (20,318,450.67 + 15,072.00) - (13,800,000.00 + 1,340,179.45 + 1,253,320.74 + 365,718.79 + 127,633.22)\nNet Income = 20,333,522.67 - 16,886,852.20\nNet Income = 3,446,670.47\n\nSince there are no dividends mentioned, the retained earnings equals the net income.\n\nInitial Retained Earnings: 0.00\nFinal Retained Earnings: 3,446,670.47\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Retained Earnings Initial Value': '0.00', 'Retained Earnings End Value': '3446670.47'}}\n```",
