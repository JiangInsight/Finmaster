1,262,568.05 (FixedAsset20231231001)\n  - 1,408,259.42 (FixedAsset20231231001)\n  - Total: 2,670,827.47\n\n### Bank transfers:\n- Cash to Bank: +6,000,000.00 (calculated above)\n- Bank to Cash: -9,000,000.00 (calculated above)\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final balances\n\n### Cash balance:\nInitial cash: 5,000,000.00\n+ Cash sales: +7,526,442.78\n+ Bank to cash transfers: +9,000,000.00\n- Cash purchases: -13,100,000.00\n- Cash expenses: -2,505,378.48\n- Cash to bank transfers: -6,000,000.00\n= Final cash balance: -78,935.70\n\n### Bank balance:\nInitial bank: 15,000,000.00\n+ Cash to bank transfers: +6,000,000.00\n- Bank purchases: -9,600,000.00\n- Fixed asset purchases: -2,670,827.47\n- Bank to cash transfers: -9,000,000.00\n= Final bank balance: -270,827.47\n\n### Total ending cash and cash equivalents:\nCash balance + Bank balance = -78,935.70 + (-270,827.47) = -349,763.17\n\nHowever, this negative balance doesn't seem right. Let me recalculate and check for errors.\n\nLooking deeper, I notice I may have double-counted some transfers or missed some transactions. Let me recalculate with a different approach by tracking the running balance.\n\nStarting with:\n- Cash: 5,000,000.00\n- Bank: 15,000,000.00\n- Total: 20,000,000.00\n\nAfter all transactions:\n- Purchases (cash and bank): -22,700,000.00\n- Expenses (all cash): -2,505,378.48\n- Sales (all cash received): +7,526,442.78\n- Fixed Assets (bank): -2,670,827.47\n- Net transfers (zero effect): 0.00\n\nThis gives: \n20,000,000.00 - 22,700,000.00 - 2,505,378.48 + 7,526,442.78 - 2,670,827.47 = -349,763.17\n\nLet me verify this calculation:\n- Initial total: 20,000,000.00\n- Total outflows: -27,876,205.95\n- Total inflows: +7,526,442.78\n- Net: -349,763.17\n\nThe negative balance still persists, which suggests either missing revenue transactions or the company is operating with a negative cash position.\n\nLet me review the data once more to ensure I haven't missed any cash inflows.\n\nOne clarification: I've treated the transfers as internal movements (between cash and bank) which have no net effect on the total. They simply move money from one account to another within the company.\n\nLooking at the data again, I don't see any cash or bank deposits beyond the initial amounts. The dates and entries appear to be chronological from Dec 31, 2023 through Feb 5, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the final ending cash and cash equivalents balance is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Ending Balance': '-349763.17'} }\n```\n\nHmm, let me double check some key figures, as a negative ending balance is unusual.\n\nLet me recalculate the expenses, as that's a large number:\nTotal of all expenses listed: ~2,505,378.48\n\nAnd let me check the purchases again:\n- Purchases paid by cash: 13,100,000.00\n- Purchases paid by bank: 9,600,000.00\n- Total purchases: 22,700,000.00\n\nFixed assets:\n- Total fixed asset purchases: 2,670,827.47\n\nSales:\n- Total cash sales: 7,526,442.78\n\nThe final balance remains negative at -349,763.17.\n\nWait, I think I need to consider accounts receivable and accounts payable. The instructions ask for \"cash and cash equivalents\" which means we should only consider actual cash movements, not accruals or credit sales.\n\nLooking back at the data, I see sales marked as \"Unpaid\" which means they're on credit and shouldn't be counted as cash inflows yet. Similarly, purchases marked \"Unpaid\" haven't resulted in cash outflows.\n\nLet me recalculate considering only paid transactions.\n\nActually, I already accounted for this in my calculation. I only included sales marked as \"Paid\" in my cash inflows, and only purchases marked as \"Paid\" in my cash outflows.\n\nTherefore, the final balance of -349,763.17 appears to be correct based on the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Ending Balance': '-349763.17'} }\n```",
