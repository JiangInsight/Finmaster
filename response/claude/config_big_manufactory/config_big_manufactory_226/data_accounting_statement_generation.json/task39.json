If interest receivable increases, it means we've recognized interest income but haven't received the cash yet - which is a negative adjustment to cash flow. If interest receivable decreases, we've received more cash than we've recognized as income - which is a positive adjustment.\n\nTo calculate the change, I'll sum all interest receivable transactions:\n\nSum of all interest receivable entries: 1068.0 + 925.5999999999999 + 925.5999999999999 + 925.5999999999999 + 925.5999999999999 + 925.5999999999999 + 925.5999999999999 + 925.5999999999999 + 747.5999999999999 + 747.5999999999999 + 747.5999999999999 + 747.5999999999999 + 747.5999999999999 + 747.5999999999999 + 747.5999999999999 + 569.6 + 569.6 + 569.6 + 480.59999999999997 + 480.59999999999997 + 368.23144355 + 368.23144355 + 242.89635517000002 + 242.89635517000002 + 242.89635517000002 + 153.89635517000002 + 153.89635517000002 + 153.89635517000002 + 153.89635517000002 + 153.89635517000002 + 64.89635517000002 + 64.89635517000002 + 145.78322375000002 + 137.03530873000003 + 44.597029580000026 + 34.277254410000026 = 17813.65\n\nThis total represents the cumulative interest receivable that has been recognized but not yet received. Since we start at zero at the beginning of the period, this is an increase in the interest receivable account.\n\nFor the cash flow statement, an increase in interest receivable is shown as a negative number (since it reduces cash flow). So we need to express this as -(17813.65).\n\nHowever, I noticed that when working with financial data, it's important to round to a reasonable number of decimal places. Let's round to 2 decimal places, which gives us -17813.65.\n\nThe correct format for the cash flow statement would be:\n\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-17813.65\"\n\nLet me double-check this calculation:\n\nActually, I need to be careful about the interpretation. In the context of the cash flow statement, we're showing the adjustment to reconcile net income to operating cash flow. If interest receivable increases, it means we've recognized more interest income than we've received in cash, so we need to subtract that increase from net income.\n\nSo the increase of 17813.65 in interest receivable represents a negative adjustment to cash flow. Based on the required format \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\", this would be shown as -17813.65.\n\nActually, I think I may have misunderstood how interest receivables are tracked in the dataset. Let me reconsider my approach.\n\nAfter reviewing the data again, I see that each interest receivable transaction likely represents the interest accrued for that day. The balance of interest receivable at the end of the period would be the sum of all these transactions (if none have been received as cash).\n\nSo the ending balance of interest receivable would be 17813.65.\n\nTo calculate the \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" for the cash flow statement, we need to determine the change from the beginning to the end of the period. Since we appear to start with zero at the beginning, the change would be an increase of 17813.65, which is shown as -17813.65 in the cash flow statement.\n\nHowever, to be completely sure, I'll check if any of these transactions were collecting previous interest receivable (which would reduce the ending balance).\n\nAll the interest receivable transactions are marked as \"Unpaid\", indicating they represent accruals of interest income that haven't been received in cash yet. So my calculation of the ending balance as 17813.65 and the change as an increase of 17813.65 is correct.\n\nFor the cash flow statement, this would be shown as:\n\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-17813.65\"\n\nLet me double-check this once more with proper rounding to 2 decimal places:\n-17813.65 rounds to -17813.65\n\nTherefore, my final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-17813.65'} }\n```\n\nHmm, actually, I just noticed that all the entries are \"Interest Receivables\" - meaning the company is owed interest, not paying it. So I need to adjust my thinking.\n\nLet's verify the ending balance of interest receivable by summing all entries:\n\nTotal of all interest receivable entries = 17813.65\n\nThis means the interest receivable account increased by 17813.65 during the period.\n\nFor the cash flow statement, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" would show -17813.65, indicating an increase in interest receivable (which is a use of cash).\n\nSo my final answer stands:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-17813.65'} }\n```",
