Identify all purchase transactions that used \"Account Payable\" as the payment method\n2. Calculate the net change in accounts payable during the period\n\nLet me start by examining all purchase transactions to identify those that have \"Account Payable\" as payment method:\n\nLooking through the data, I need to find transactions with:\n- type = \"Purchase\" \n- payment_method = \"Account Payable\"\n\nExamining all the purchase transactions in the data, I don't see any explicit \"Account Payable\" payment method marked transactions. However, I should also identify any unpaid purchases, as these would effectively be accounts payable.\n\nChecking for purchases with payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\":\n\nI don't see any unpaid purchases in the data. All purchase transactions appear to be paid using cash or bank transfer.\n\nTo calculate the change in accounts payable, I need to look at the beginning and ending balance of accounts payable.\n\nSince there are no evident accounts payable transactions in this dataset (no purchases marked as \"Account Payable\" or \"Unpaid\"), it appears that the change in accounts payable for this period is zero.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if there are any other transactions that might represent accounts payable. In some accounting systems, accounts payable might be represented differently.\n\nAfter thoroughly reviewing the data, I don't see any other transactions that would contribute to accounts payable.\n\nTherefore, the increase (decrease) in accounts payable appears to be zero for this period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '0.00'} }\n```",
