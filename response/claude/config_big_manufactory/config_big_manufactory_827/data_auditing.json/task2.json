First, I'll check the transaction IDs to identify any duplicates that might indicate issues\n2. Then I'll look for date inconsistencies by comparing recorded_date with dates mentioned in the invoice\n3. I'll examine other fields for potential errors\n\nLooking through the data, I found some inconsistencies:\n\n1. **Expense20240118001**: The recorded date (2024-02-06) doesn't match the date mentioned in the invoice (January 18, 2024)\n2. **Expense20240129001**: The recorded date (2024-02-14) doesn't match the date mentioned in the invoice (January 29, 2024)\n\nThese are clear errors in the recorded_date field, as the invoice text (considered more reliable) mentions different dates than what was recorded.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": \"2024-01-18\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-02-06\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Expense20240118001\"}}\n```",
