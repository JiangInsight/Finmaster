The `recorded_type` is listed as \"Administrative Expenses\"\n2. The `recorded_amount` is $1,129,228.86\n3. But the invoice states: \"On February 03, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Bank to cash transfer, totaling $1000000.00.\"\n\nThis shows two clear inconsistencies:\n- The transaction type is incorrectly recorded as \"Administrative Expenses\" when it should be \"Bank to cash transfer\"\n- The amount is recorded as $1,129,228.86 when it should be $1,000,000.00\n\nSince the invoice is considered more reliable due to its standardized and regulated nature, I'll use it as the source of truth.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Bank to cash transfer\", \"Recorded category\": \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"1000000.00\", \"Recorded amount\": \"1129228.86\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Transfer20240203001\"}}\n```",
