The category is incorrectly recorded as a Sales Expense when it's actually a Purchase. The amount and unit price values don't match what's stated in the invoice, which is generally considered more reliable.\n\nI don't see any other clear inconsistencies in the remaining transactions where the recorded information contradicts the invoice text or has internal calculation errors.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Purchase', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '500000.0', 'Recorded price': '440677.26', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '1000000.0', 'Recorded amount': '1102214.56', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Purchase20231231009'} }\n```",
