The transaction ID \"Sale20240205042\" suggests it should be a sale\n2. The recorded_type is \"Administrative Expenses\" which contradicts the ID\n3. The invoice text explicitly states it's a Sale: \"On February 05, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale...\"\n4. The recorded_amount is 0.0, but the invoice mentions a total of $2,144,176.18\n5. The recorded_quantity is 0.0, but the invoice states \"consisting of 1.0 units\"\n\nThis transaction has multiple inconsistencies:\n- Category mismatch: Should be \"Sale\" not \"Administrative Expenses\"\n- Quantity error: Should be 1.0 not 0.0\n- Amount error: Should be $2,144,176.18 not $0.0 (this appears to be missing entirely)\n\nLooking at the other fields, we can see the unit price, tax, and other sales-related information is present, further confirming this should be categorized as a Sale.\n\nGiven the evidence from the invoice (which is considered more reliable), I can determine:\n- The correct transaction type is \"Sale\"\n- The correct quantity is 1.0\n- The correct amount is $2,144,176.18\n\nThe incorrect fields are:\n- recorded_type (Administrative Expenses instead of Sale)\n- recorded_quantity (0.0 instead of 1.0)\n- recorded_amount (0.0 instead of 2,144,176.18)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"0.0\", \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"2144176.18\", \"Recorded amount\": \"0.0\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240205042\"}}\n```",
