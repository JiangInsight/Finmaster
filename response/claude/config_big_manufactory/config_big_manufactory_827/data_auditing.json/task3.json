The invoice states it was paid, but the recorded status is unpaid.\n\nChecking other entries for inconsistencies but not seeing any other clear ones where the invoice text contradicts the recorded fields.\n\nFor the transaction ID Expense20240203001, the recorded payment status is \"Unpaid\" but the invoice text indicates it should be \"Paid\". This is a clear inconsistency.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240203001'} }\n```",
