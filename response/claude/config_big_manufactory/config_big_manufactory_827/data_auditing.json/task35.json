The date in the invoice (Dec 31, 2023) also matches the transaction ID date format.\n\nBased on this analysis, there are clear inconsistencies in this transaction record compared to the invoice information.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Purchase', 'Recorded category': 'Administrative Expenses', 'Original date': '2023-12-31', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-15', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Original payment_method': 'Bank Transfer', 'Recorded payment_method': 'Bank Transfer', 'Original quantity': '2.0', 'Recorded quantity': '1.0', 'Original price': '1000000.0', 'Recorded price': '957143.3', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '2000000.0', 'Recorded amount': '2228546.61', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': 'Senior Staff', 'Recorded Preparer': 'Senior Staff', 'Original Approver': 'Director', 'Recorded Approver': 'Director', 'id': 'Purchase20231231010'} }\n```",
