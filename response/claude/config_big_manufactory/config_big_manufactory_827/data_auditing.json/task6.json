The amount matches the invoice (800000.0), but the unit price is incorrect.\n\nLet me check for other inconsistencies...\n\nI don't see any other clear inconsistencies in the other transactions. The main issue is with the Purchase20231231001 record where the recorded unit price doesn't match the invoice description.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"800000.00\", \"Recorded price\": \"911514.54\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Purchase20231231001\"}}\n```",
