This is an inconsistency that needs to be corrected.\n\nThere's also a second similar case with transaction ID \"Expense20240115001\" in the examples, where the approver field was missing but should be \"Director\" according to the invoice.\n\nAfter checking all other fields for inconsistencies, I don't see any other clear discrepancies between the recorded fields and what is stated in the invoice descriptions.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": \"Director\", \"Recorded Approver\": \"None\", \"id\": \"Expense20240131001\"}}\n```",
