Quantity: Invoice says 2.0 units, but record shows 1.0 unit\n2. Payment status: Invoice says \"paid\", but record shows \"unpaid\"\n\nSince the invoice is considered more reliable and standardized, I'll consider the invoice information as the correct version and flag this as an inconsistency.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"2.00\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"1.00\", \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"2000000.00\", \"Recorded amount\": \"1000000.00\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Purchase20231231002\"}}\n```",
