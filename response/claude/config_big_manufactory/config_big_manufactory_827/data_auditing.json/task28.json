Recorded date (2024-02-02) vs invoice date (2024-01-25)\n2. Recorded amount (1642080.24) vs invoice amount (1318422.35)\n3. Recorded unit price (1233217.64) vs invoice unit price (1318422.35)\n\n## Analysis for Sale20240130057\nI don't see any clear inconsistencies in this transaction from the data provided.\n\nI'll also check the calculations:\n- For Sale20240125030: Cost amount is 1000000.00, profit is reported as 318422.35 which matches with 1318422.35 - 1000000.00\n- The tax amount (65921.12) is approximately 5% of the total amount (1318422.35)\n- After-tax amount (1252501.23) equals total amount (1318422.35) minus tax (65921.12)\n\nThese calculations confirm that the invoice amount should be 1318422.35, not 1642080.24.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-25', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-02', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '1318422.35', 'Recorded price': '1233217.64', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '1318422.35', 'Recorded amount': '1642080.24', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240125030'} }\n```",
