Looking at the recorded_type: It's recorded as \"Sales Expenses\" but the invoice describes it as a \"Sale\".\n\n2. The recorded_date is 2024-01-12, but the invoice states it was issued on January 11, 2024.\n\n3. The recorded_quantity is 0, but the invoice mentions 1.0 units.\n\n4. The recorded_amount is 0.0, but the invoice states the total amount is $2,215,044.89.\n\n5. The recorded_unit_price is $1,866,433.05, but the invoice states it's $2,215,044.89.\n\n6. The recorded_tax_amount is $2,185,606.28, but the invoice states it's $110,752.24.\n\n7. The recorded_profit shows $715,044.89, which seems inconsistent with a $0 sale amount.\n\nAccording to the invoice (which is considered more reliable), this should be:\n- A sale transaction\n- Occurred on 2024-01-11\n- For 1.0 unit\n- At a unit price of $2,215,044.89\n- With a tax amount of $110,752.24\n- The cost amount was $1,500,000.00\n- Leading to a profit of $715,044.89 (which is $2,215,044.89 - $1,500,000.00)\n\nThis transaction has multiple inconsistencies between the recorded data and the invoice data.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original date': '2024-01-11', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-12', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '1.00', 'Recorded quantity': '0.00', 'Original price': '2215044.89', 'Recorded price': '1866433.05', 'Original receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Original amount': '2215044.89', 'Recorded amount': '0.00', 'Original tax': '110752.24', 'Recorded tax': '2185606.28', 'Original profit': '715044.89', 'Recorded profit': '715044.89', 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240111011'} }\n```",
