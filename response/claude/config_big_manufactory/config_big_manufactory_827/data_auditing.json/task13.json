The recorded_type shows \"Purchase\" but the ID starts with \"Sale\" and the invoice explicitly states it's a Sale: \"On January 24, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale...\"\n\n2. The recorded_tax_amount is 676286.4, but according to the invoice, the tax amount should be 36846.43 (which is roughly 5% of the sale price, a more reasonable tax rate).\n\n3. The transaction appears to be a sale of Heavy Equipment A for 736928.63, with a cost amount of 500000.0, yielding a profit of 236928.63, all of which is consistent with a sale transaction, not a purchase.\n\nThe internal inconsistency is clear - this is a sale transaction incorrectly recorded as a purchase, with an incorrect tax amount that is significantly higher than what's stated in the invoice.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Purchase\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": \"36846.43\", \"Recorded tax\": \"676286.40\", \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240124028\"}}\n```",
