There are no long-term liabilities mentioned, so this amount represents the total debt.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio.\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -$13,358,400.82 / $1,903,121.89\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -7.02\n\nStep 4: Round to two decimal places.\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -7.02\n\nTherefore, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is -7.02, which indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative and is 7.02 times its total debt, which is concerning for debt servicing capability.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-7.02'}}\n```",
