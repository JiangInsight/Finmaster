Debt to Asset Ratio\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt.\n\nFormula: Total Liabilities ÷ Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = $1,903,121.89 (Total Current Liabilities)\n- Total Assets = $31,154,033.87\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $1,903,121.89 ÷ $31,154,033.87 = 0.0611 ≈ 0.06\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\nThe Gross Profit Margin measures the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold.\n\nFormula: (Gross Profit ÷ Total Revenue) × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = $4,962,437.45\n- Total Revenue = $18,062,437.45\n\nGross Profit Margin = ($4,962,437.45 ÷ $18,062,437.45) × 100% = 27.47%\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThe Operating Cash Flow Ratio measures a company's ability to cover current liabilities with cash generated from operations.\n\nFormula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities ÷ Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$13,358,400.82\n- Total Current Liabilities = $1,903,121.89\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$13,358,400.82 ÷ $1,903,121.89 = -7.02\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Gross Profit Margin': '27.47%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-7.02'}}\n```",
