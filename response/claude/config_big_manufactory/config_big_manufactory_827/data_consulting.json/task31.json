                        "content": "I'll calculate the requested financial ratios step by step based on the provided financial statements.\n\n## 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how effectively a company collects its receivables.\n- Formula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n- Net Credit Sales = Main Business Revenue = $18,062,437.45\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2 = ($0 + $10,537,836.59) / 2 = $5,268,918.30\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $18,062,437.45 / $5,268,918.30 = 3.43\n\n## 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to cover its current liabilities with its operating cash flow.\n- Formula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n- Operating Cash Flow = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$13,358,400.82\n- Current Liabilities = $1,903,121.89\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -$13,358,400.82 / $1,903,121.89 = -7.02\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio calculated above.\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -7.02\n\n## 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n- Formula: Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n- Net Sales = $18,062,437.45\n- Average Total Assets = (Beginning Assets + Ending Assets) / 2 = ($28,000,000 + $31,154,033.87) / 2 = $29,577,016.94\n- Total Asset Turnover Ratio = $18,062,437.45 / $29,577,016.94 = 0.61\n\n## 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio indicates the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets.\n- Formula: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n- Total Liabilities = $1,903,121.89\n- Total Equity = $29,250,911.98\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = $1,903,121.89 / $29,250,911.98 = 0.07\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.43', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-7.02', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-7.02', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.61', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.07'} }\n```",
