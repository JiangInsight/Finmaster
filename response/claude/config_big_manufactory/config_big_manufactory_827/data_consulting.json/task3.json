The Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt.\n\nThe formula is: Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $1,903,121.89\n- Total Assets = $31,154,033.87\n\nNow I'll calculate the ratio:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $1,903,121.89 / $31,154,033.87 = 0.0611 or approximately 0.06\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the Debt to Asset Ratio is 0.06.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06'}}\n```",
