                        "content": "I'll solve this step by step by calculating the three requested financial ratios.\n\n## 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio compares the company's total debt to its shareholders' equity.\n- Formula: Total Liabilities ÷ Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = $1,903,121.89 (Total Current Liabilities)\n- Total Owner's Equity = $29,250,911.98\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $1,903,121.89 ÷ $29,250,911.98 = 0.0651 ≈ 0.07\n\n## 2. Net Profit Margin\nThis ratio shows the percentage of revenue that translates into net profit.\n- Formula: Net Profit ÷ Total Revenue × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = $1,250,911.98\n- Total Revenue = $18,062,437.45\n\nNet Profit Margin = ($1,250,911.98 ÷ $18,062,437.45) × 100% = 6.93%\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with its operating cash flow.\n- Formula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities ÷ Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$13,358,400.82\n- Total Current Liabilities = $1,903,121.89\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -$13,358,400.82 ÷ $1,903,121.89 = -7.02\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.07\", \"Net Profit Margin\": \"6.93%\", \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-7.02\"}}\n```",
