                        "content": "I'll calculate the requested financial ratios step by step based on the three financial statements provided.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay its current liabilities from its operating cash flow.\n- Operating Cash Flow = -13,358,400.82\n- Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -13,358,400.82 / 1,903,121.89 = -7.02\n\n## 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio shows the proportion of debt to equity.\n- Total Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n- Total Equity = 29,250,911.98\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = 1,903,121.89 / 29,250,911.98 = 0.07\n\n## 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n- Revenue = 18,062,437.45\n- Average Total Assets = (28,000,000.00 + 31,154,033.87) / 2 = 29,577,016.94\n- Total Asset Turnover Ratio = 18,062,437.45 / 29,577,016.94 = 0.61\n\n## 4. Quick Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n- Quick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 20,796,970.06 - 6,100,000.00 = 14,696,970.06\n- Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n- Quick Ratio = 14,696,970.06 / 1,903,121.89 = 7.72\n\n## 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio calculated above.\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -7.02\n\n## 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\nThis measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit it generates with the money shareholders have invested.\n- Net Income = 1,250,911.98\n- Average Shareholders' Equity = (28,000,000.00 + 29,250,911.98) / 2 = 28,625,455.99\n- ROE = (1,250,911.98 / 28,625,455.99) Ã— 100 = 4.37%\n\n## 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\n- Revenue = 18,062,437.45\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 10,537,836.59) / 2 = 5,268,918.30\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 18,062,437.45 / 5,268,918.30 = 3.43\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-7.02', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.07', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.61', 'Quick Ratio': '7.72', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-7.02', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '4.37%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.43'} }\n```",
