Cash: This includes Cash on Hand and Bank Deposits from the balance sheet\n2. Current Debt: This is the Total Current Liabilities from the balance sheet\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand (End): $3,041,599.18\n- Bank Deposits (End): $1,103,978.40\n- Total Current Liabilities (End): $1,903,121.89\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total cash\nTotal Cash = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits\nTotal Cash = $3,041,599.18 + $1,103,978.40 = $4,145,577.58\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Cash to Current Debt Ratio\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = Total Cash / Total Current Liabilities\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = $4,145,577.58 / $1,903,121.89 = 2.18\n\nThe Cash to Current Debt Ratio is 2.18, which I'll round to 2 decimal places.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '2.18'} }\n```",
