FCF typically represents the cash a company generates after accounting for operating cash flow and capital expenditures.\n\nThe formula for FCF is:\nFCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures\n\nLet's extract the needed values:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -13,358,400.82\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (Capital Expenditures) = 2,496,021.60\n\nSince Purchase of Fixed Assets is already recorded as a positive number but represents an outflow (as indicated by the negative Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities), I need to subtract it from Operating Cash Flow.\n\nFCF = -13,358,400.82 - 2,496,021.60 = -15,854,422.42\n\nI can verify this result by checking the Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents, which is -15,854,422.42. This makes sense since the FCF should match the overall change in cash position.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-15854422.42'}}\n```",
