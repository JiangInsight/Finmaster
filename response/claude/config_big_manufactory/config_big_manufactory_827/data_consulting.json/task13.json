                        "content": "I need to calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the financial statements provided.\n\nThe Inventory Turnover Ratio measures how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. The formula is:\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nLet's gather the necessary data:\n1. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = $13,100,000.00 (from the income statement)\n2. Beginning Inventory = $0.00 (from the initial amount in the balance sheet)\n3. Ending Inventory = $6,100,000.00 (from the end amount in the balance sheet)\n\nNow I'll calculate the average inventory:\nAverage Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2\nAverage Inventory = ($0.00 + $6,100,000.00) / 2 = $3,050,000.00\n\nNow I can calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio:\nInventory Turnover Ratio = $13,100,000.00 / $3,050,000.00 = 4.30\n\nTherefore, the inventory turned over approximately 4.30 times during the period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '4.30'}}\n```",
