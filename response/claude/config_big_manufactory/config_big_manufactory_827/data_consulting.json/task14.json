                        "content": "I need to calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio, which measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\n\nThe formula for Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is:\nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nLet me gather the necessary information:\n\n1. Net Credit Sales: From the income statement, this would be the Main Business Revenue = $18,062,437.45\n\n2. Average Accounts Receivable: Since the company started with $0 accounts receivable and ended with $10,537,836.59, the average is:\n   ($0 + $10,537,836.59) / 2 = $5,268,918.30\n\nNow I can calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:\n$18,062,437.45 / $5,268,918.30 = 3.43\n\nLet me verify this calculation:\n$18,062,437.45 รท $5,268,918.30 = 3.428 (rounded to 3.43)\n\nTherefore, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is 3.43.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.43'} }\n```",
