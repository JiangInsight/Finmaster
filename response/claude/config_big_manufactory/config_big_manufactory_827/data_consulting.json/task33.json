                        "content": "I'll solve this step by step, calculating the requested financial ratios based on the provided financial statements.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis measures the company's ability to cover current liabilities with operating cash flows.\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -13,358,400.82\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -13,358,400.82 / 1,903,121.89 = -7.02\n\n## 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nThis measures the company's ability to repay its debt using operating cash flow.\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -13,358,400.82\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89 (since there are no long-term debts)\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -13,358,400.82 / 1,903,121.89 = -7.02\n\n## 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how many times a company sells and replaces its inventory during a period.\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 13,100,000.00\n- Average Inventory = (0 + 6,100,000.00) / 2 = 3,050,000.00\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = 13,100,000.00 / 3,050,000.00 = 4.30\n\n## 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures the company's financial leverage.\n- Total Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n- Total Owner's Equity = 29,250,911.98\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = 1,903,121.89 / 29,250,911.98 = 0.07\n\n## 5. Quick Ratio\nThis measures the company's ability to pay short-term obligations without relying on inventory.\n- (Current Assets - Inventory) = (20,796,970.06 - 6,100,000.00) = 14,696,970.06\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n- Quick Ratio = 14,696,970.06 / 1,903,121.89 = 7.72\n\n## 6. Current Ratio\nThis measures the company's ability to pay short-term obligations.\n- Total Current Assets = 20,796,970.06\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n- Current Ratio = 20,796,970.06 / 1,903,121.89 = 10.93\n\nLet me round these to 2 decimal places for the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-7.02', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-7.02', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '4.30', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.07', 'Quick Ratio': '7.72', 'Current Ratio': '10.93'} }\n```",
