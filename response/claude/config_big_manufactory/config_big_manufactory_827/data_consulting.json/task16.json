This ratio measures how efficiently a company is using its assets to generate revenue.\n\nThe formula for Total Asset Turnover Ratio is:\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = Net Sales (Revenue) / Average Total Assets\n\nStep 1: Find the Net Sales (Revenue) from the income statement.\nNet Sales = Main Business Revenue = $18,062,437.45\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Average Total Assets.\nBeginning Total Assets (2023-12-31) = $28,000,000.00\nEnding Total Assets (2024-02-05) = $31,154,033.87\nAverage Total Assets = ($28,000,000.00 + $31,154,033.87) / 2 = $29,577,016.94\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Total Asset Turnover Ratio.\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = $18,062,437.45 / $29,577,016.94 = 0.6107\n\nSince the ratio is typically rounded to two decimal places:\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = 0.61\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.61'} }\n```",
