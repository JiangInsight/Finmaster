                        "content": "I'll solve this problem by calculating the Net Cash Ratio, Current Assets Turnover Ratio, and Quick Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n## Step 1: Calculate Net Cash Ratio\nThe Net Cash Ratio (also called Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio) measures the relationship between operating cash flow and net income.\n\nNet Cash Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Net Income\n- Operating Cash Flow = -$13,358,400.82 (from cash flow statement)\n- Net Income = $1,250,911.98 (from income statement)\n\nNet Cash Ratio = -13,358,400.82 ÷ 1,250,911.98 = -10.68\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Current Assets Turnover Ratio\nThe Current Assets Turnover Ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate revenue.\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Current Assets\n- Total Revenue = $18,062,437.45 (from income statement)\n- Initial Current Assets = $20,000,000.00\n- Ending Current Assets = $20,796,970.06\n- Average Current Assets = (20,000,000.00 + 20,796,970.06) ÷ 2 = $20,398,485.03\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = 18,062,437.45 ÷ 20,398,485.03 = 0.89\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Quick Ratio\nThe Quick Ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n- Current Assets = $20,796,970.06\n- Inventory = $6,100,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = $1,903,121.89\n\nQuick Ratio = (20,796,970.06 - 6,100,000.00) ÷ 1,903,121.89 = 14,696,970.06 ÷ 1,903,121.89 = 7.72\n\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Ratio': '-10.68', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.89', 'Quick Ratio': '7.72'}}",
