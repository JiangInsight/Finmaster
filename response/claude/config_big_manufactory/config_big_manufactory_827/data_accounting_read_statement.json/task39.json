However, the task asks for the \"reduction in the amount of assets held for sale,\" which would be the opposite of an increase.\n\nSince the inventory increased by 6,100,000.00, this is the value I need to report (keeping the negative sign to indicate it's a reduction rather than an addition to cash flow).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-6100000.00'}}\n```",
