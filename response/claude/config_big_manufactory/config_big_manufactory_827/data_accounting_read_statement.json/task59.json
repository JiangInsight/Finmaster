Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nLet me review each financial statement to locate these items.\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- Interest Receivable: 13,555.89 (End_amount)\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents: -15,854,422.42 (this is the \"Net Increase\" line under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\")\n\nI can also verify the interest receivable matches the Interest Income shown in the Income Statement, which is 13,555.89, confirming this is the interest accrued but not yet received.\n\nTherefore, the two values I need to extract are:\n- value1 (interest accrued but not yet received): 13,555.89\n- value2 (net addition in cash and cash equivalents): -15,854,422.42\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13555.89', 'value2': '-15854422.42'}}\n```",
