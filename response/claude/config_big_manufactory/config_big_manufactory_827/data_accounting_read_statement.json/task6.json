Looking at the balance sheet provided, I can see the \"Fixed Assets\" line item which would represent these tangible assets.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- The initial value of Fixed Assets as of 2023-12-31 is 8,000,000.00\n- The end value of Fixed Assets as of 2024-02-05 is 10,496,021.60\n\nTherefore, my solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"10496021.60\"}}\n```",
