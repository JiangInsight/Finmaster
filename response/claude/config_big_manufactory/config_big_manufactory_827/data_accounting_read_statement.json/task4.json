This represents money that has been earned as interest but hasn't actually been received yet.\n\nFrom the balance sheet provided:\n- The initial value of Interest Receivable as of 2023-12-31 is 0.00\n- The end value of Interest Receivable as of 2024-02-05 is 13555.89\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '13555.89'}}\n```",
