Reduction in inventory\n3. Net cash flow from investing activities\n4. Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n\nLet me identify each one in the given statement:\n\n1. Depreciation: This is clearly labeled in the statement as \"Depreciation\" with a value of 138957.79\n\n2. Reduction in inventory: This is shown as \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with a value of -6100000.00. The negative sign indicates an increase, not a reduction, but this is the line item we need.\n\n3. Net cash flow from investing activities: This is shown as \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with a value of -2496021.60\n\n4. Net increase in cash and cash equivalents: This is shown as \"Net Increase\" with a value of -15854422.42\n\nNow I'll format these values in the required JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '138957.79', 'value2': '-6100000.00', 'value3': '-2496021.60', 'value4': '-15854422.42'}}\n```",
