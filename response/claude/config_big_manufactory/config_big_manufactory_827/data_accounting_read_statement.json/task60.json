The income earned by an entity from financial assets (from the income statement)\n\nLet me analyze each statement:\n\nFrom the balance sheet, I can see the \"Bank Deposits\" line item with an end amount of 1,103,978.40 as of 2024-02-05. This represents the funds deposited into a bank.\n\nFrom the income statement, I need to find income earned from financial assets, which would be the \"Interest Income\" line item with a value of 13,555.89 as of 2024-02-05.\n\nTherefore, the two values I need to extract are:\n- value1 (Bank Deposits): 1103978.40\n- value2 (Interest Income): 13555.89\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1103978.40', 'value2': '13555.89'}}\n```",
