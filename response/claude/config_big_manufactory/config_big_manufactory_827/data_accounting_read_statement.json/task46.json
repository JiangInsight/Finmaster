The section \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" shows:\n\n1. \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an amount of 2,496,021.60\n2. \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with an amount of -2,496,021.60\n\nThe net cash flow from investing activities is -2,496,021.60, which represents the cash used for investing activities. The negative sign indicates cash outflow.\n\nThe only component sub-item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of 2,496,021.60 (positive number representing the expense).\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2496021.60', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '2496021.60'}}}\n```",
