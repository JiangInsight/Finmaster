This is because:\n\n1. Accumulated Depreciation represents the cumulative expense recognized from depreciation of fixed assets over time.\n2. In accounting, depreciation is recorded as an expense in the income statement.\n3. The accumulated depreciation account shows how much of the fixed assets' value has been expensed since acquisition.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial value of Accumulated Depreciation (2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End value of Accumulated Depreciation (2024-02-05): 138957.79\n\nTherefore, the expense line item to extract is Accumulated Depreciation.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '138957.79'}}\n```",
