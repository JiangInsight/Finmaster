When customers owe a company money for goods or services (accounts receivable), an increase in this amount means more customers owe money, while a decrease would mean customers have paid their debts.\n\nStep 2: Scan the cash flow statement for relevant line items. The \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is exactly what I'm looking for.\n\nStep 3: Check the value of this line item. I see that \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" has a value of -10537836.59.\n\nStep 4: Interpret the negative value. The negative sign in front of the value indicates an increase in accounts receivable (more money owed to the company). This means the company has more outstanding credit from customers, not a decrease.\n\nHowever, since the task specifically asks for the \"decrease\" in amounts owed, and the line item shows an increase (negative value), I need to report the value as given in the cash flow statement, which represents an increase in accounts receivable.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-10537836.59'} }\n```",
