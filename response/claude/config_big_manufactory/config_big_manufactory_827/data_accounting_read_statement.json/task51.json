First, I'll check the balance sheet for any receivables related to interest:\n   - I found \"Interest Receivable\" with Initial_amount: 0.00 (2023-12-31) and End_amount: 13555.89 (2024-02-05)\n\n2. To confirm this is indeed interest accrued but not yet received, I'll check the cash flow statement:\n   - There's a line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" with Amount: -13555.89\n   - The negative value indicates an increase in Interest Receivable, confirming this is interest accrued but not received\n\n3. Further validation in the income statement:\n   - \"Interest Income\" is listed as 13555.89, which matches the Interest Receivable amount\n\nBased on this analysis, the Interest Receivable represents interest that has been accrued but not yet received, with an initial value of 0.00 and a final value of 13555.89.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '13555.89'}}\n```",
