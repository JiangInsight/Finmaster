In the balance sheet, there's a line item \"Taxes Payable\" showing a balance of 903121.89 as of 2024-02-05.\n\n2. In the cash flow statement, there's a line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an amount of 903121.89.\n\n3. Most importantly, in the income statement, there's a specific line item \"Tax Expense\" with a value of 903121.89 for the period ending 2024-02-05.\n\nThe \"Tax Expense\" line in the income statement represents the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay for the reporting period. This is the most relevant figure for this task as it shows the tax obligation for the specific reporting period rather than just the balance at a point in time.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during this reporting period is 903121.89.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '903121.89'} }\n```",
