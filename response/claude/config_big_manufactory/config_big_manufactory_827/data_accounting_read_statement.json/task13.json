Current assets are listed first (Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, Accounts Receivable, Inventory) with a \"Total Current Assets\" line.\n\n2. Below that are the non-current assets which include:\n   - Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.00 (initial) → 10,496,021.60 (end)\n   - Accumulated Depreciation: 0.00 (initial) → 138,957.79 (end)\n   - Total Non-current Assets: 8,000,000.00 (initial) → 10,357,063.81 (end)\n\nThe \"Total Non-current Assets\" line represents all assets not expected to be realized or used in the normal operating cycle.
