Accounts payable represent the company's obligations to pay suppliers or creditors.\n\nFirst, I'll examine all transactions with payment method labeled as \"Account Payable\" to find the relevant entries.\n\nStep 1: Find all purchases that were marked as \"Account Payable\" and check their payment status.\n\nLooking through the data, I can find the following relevant transactions:\n- Purchase20231231011: Amount = 1,000,000.00, Payment status = Unpaid, Payment method = Account Payable\n\nThis is the only purchase transaction that uses accounts payable as the payment method and remains unpaid.\n\nStep 2: Check if there were any payments made against accounts payable during the period.\n\nI don't see any transactions in the data that represent payments against existing accounts payable.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the net change in accounts payable.\n\nSince we have one unpaid purchase using accounts payable as payment method with amount of 1,000,000.00, and no payments against accounts payable, the net increase in accounts payable is 1,000,000.00.\n\nThe final accounts payable item in the cash flow statement represents the increase or decrease in accounts payable during the period. Since accounts payable increased by 1,000,000.00, this would be shown as a positive value in the cash flow statement (as an increase in a liability represents a source of cash).\n\nTherefore, the value for \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is 1,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '1000000.00'} }\n```",
