                        "content": "I need to calculate the final net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement. This requires analyzing all transactions affecting cash and bank balances.\n\nLet's start by identifying the initial cash and bank deposits, and then track all transactions that increase or decrease these accounts.\n\nInitial positions:\n- Cash deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: 15,000,000.00\n- Total initial cash and cash equivalents: 20,000,000.00\n\nNow I'll track the transactions affecting cash and bank balances:\n\n1. Cash transactions:\n   - Purchases paid in cash: -800,000.00 (Purchase20231231001) - 3,000,000.00 (Purchase20231231008)\n   - Expenses paid in cash: All expense transactions marked as \"Paid\" with payment method \"Cash\"\n   - Sales received in cash: All sales transactions with receive_method \"Cash\"\n   - Cash to bank transfers: Outflows\n   - Bank to cash transfers: Inflows\n\n2. Bank transactions:\n   - Purchases paid by bank transfer: -2,000,000.00 (Purchase20231231002) - 800,000.00 (Purchase20231231003) etc.\n   - Fixed assets purchased by bank transfer: -871,751.87 (FixedAsset20231231001) etc.\n   - Cash to bank transfers: Inflows\n   - Bank to cash transfers: Outflows\n\nLet me calculate the total of all expense transactions paid in cash:\nTotal expenses paid in cash: -2,545,975.36\n\nTotal sales received in cash:\n- Sale20240106004: 684,558.74\n- Sale20240107005: 1,354,106.17\n- Sale20240122024: 652,509.01\n- Sale20240124028: 736,928.63\n- Sale20240129034: 1,952,322.13\n- Sale20240205042: 2,144,176.18\nTotal sales received in cash: 7,524,600.86\n\nTotal purchases paid in cash: -3,800,000.00\n\nTotal purchases paid by bank transfer: -11,200,000.00\n\nTotal fixed assets purchased by bank transfer: -2,496,021.60\n\nBank to cash transfers:\n- Transfer20240117001: 1,000,000.00\n- Transfer20240203001: 1,000,000.00\n- Transfer20240204001: 1,000,000.00\nTotal bank to cash transfers: 3,000,000.00\n\nCash to bank transfers:\n- Transfer20240204001: -1,000,000.00\n- Transfer20240205001: -1,000,000.00\nTotal cash to bank transfers: -2,000,000.00\n\nAdding up all these transactions:\nInitial: 20,000,000.00\nExpenses paid in cash: -2,545,975.36\nSales received in cash: 7,524,600.86\nPurchases paid in cash: -3,800,000.00\nPurchases paid by bank transfer: -11,200,000.00\nFixed assets purchased by bank transfer: -2,496,021.60\nNet transfers between cash and bank: 1,000,000.00 (this nets to zero for total cash and cash equivalents)\n\nThe net increase (or decrease) in cash and cash equivalents is:\n20,000,000.00 - 2,545,975.36 + 7,524,600.86 - 3,800,000.00 - 11,200,000.00 - 2,496,021.60 = -12,517,396.10\n\nDouble-checking: we started with 20,000,000.00 and ended up with 7,482,603.90, which represents a decrease of 12,517,396.10.\n\nLet me verify this by summing up all cash flow transactions directly:\n- Initial cash and bank: 20,000,000.00\n- All cash outflows (expenses, purchases, fixed assets): -20,042,000.00 \n- All cash inflows (sales received in cash): 7,524,600.86\n- Net: -12,517,399.14 (slight rounding difference)\n\nThe final net increase in cash and cash equivalents is therefore -12,517,396.10, rounded to two decimals.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Net Increase': '-12517396.10'}}",
