Let me work through this step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Identify initial values from the initial entries\n\nLooking at the first three transactions labeled \"Initial20231231001\":\n- Cash deposit: $5,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: $15,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets: $8,000,000.00\n\nThese represent the initial balance sheet values.\n\n## Step 2: Track purchases and inventory\n\nThe company purchased various heavy equipment:\n- Heavy Equipment purchases total: $16,200,000.00 (from all purchase transactions)\n- This becomes the company's inventory\n\n## Step 3: Track fixed asset purchases\n\nAdditional fixed assets purchased:\n- Heavy Machinery: $871,751.87\n- Industrial Facilities: $1,046,775.17\n- Production Line Equipment: $577,494.56\n- Total additional fixed assets: $2,496,021.60\n\n## Step 4: Track sales and accounts receivable\n\nThe company made numerous sales, some paid immediately (cash) and others on credit (accounts receivable).\n- Total Accounts Receivable: $8,420,732.07 (from unpaid sales)\n\n## Step 5: Track cash and bank deposit changes\n\nCash flows from:\n- Initial deposit\n- Sales (cash)\n- Purchases (paid)\n- Expenses\n- Transfers between cash and bank\n\n## Step 6: Track liabilities\n\n- Accounts Payable: $1,000,000.00 (from unpaid purchases)\n- Taxes Payable: $657,844.98 (from tax amounts on sales)\n\n## Step 7: Calculate depreciation\n\n- Accumulated Depreciation: $138,957.79 (from depreciation entries)\n\n## Step 8: Calculate interest receivables\n\n- Interest Receivable: $15,162.72 (from interest receivable entries)\n\n## Step 9: Calculate retained earnings\n\nThis includes profit from sales minus expenses and depreciation.\n\n## Step 10: Compile the balance sheet\n\nAfter processing all transactions, I can now prepare the complete balance sheet:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\",\n  \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"15000000.00\",\n  \"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"20000000.00\",\n  \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n  \"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n  \"Total Assets Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\",\n  \"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\",\n  \"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n  \"Total Owner's Equity Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\",\n  \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\",\n  \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"2848364.73\",\n  \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"14000000.00\",\n  \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"15162.72\",\n  \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"8420732.07\",\n  \"Inventory End Value\": \"8200000.00\",\n  \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"33484259.52\",\n  \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"10496021.60\",\n  \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"138957.79\",\n  \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"10357063.81\",\n  \"Total Assets End Value\": \"43841323.33\",\n  \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"1000000.00\",\n  \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"657844.98\",\n  \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"1657844.98\",\n  \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"28000000.00\",\n  \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"14183478.35\",\n  \"Total Owner's Equity End Value\": \"42183478.35\",\n  \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity End Value\": \"43841323.33\"\n}}\n```",
