Let me double-check the calculations considering the actual cash flow movements.\n\nThe cash and bank transfers also need to be considered:\n- Net cash to/from bank transfers: 0 (they cancel each other out)\n\nWhen we calculate the actual ending cash balance from the transactions:\nBeginning cash and bank: 20,000,000.00\nCash used for expenses and purchases: -10,614,431.10\nCash received from sales: 9,592,843.37\n\nThis gives a more realistic ending balance of approximately 18,978,412.27.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Net Profit\": \"2495324.25\", \"Depreciation\": \"138957.79\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-10537836.59\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-13056.58\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-19200000.00\", \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"1000000.00\", \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"923138.05\", \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-25193473.08\", \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"2496021.60\", \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-2496021.60\", \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": \"0.00\", \"Beginning Balance\": \"20000000.00\", \"Ending Balance\": \"18978412.27\", \"Net Increase\": \"-1021587.73\"}}\n```",
