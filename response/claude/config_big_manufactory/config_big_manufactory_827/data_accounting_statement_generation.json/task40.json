In the cash flow statement, an increase in inventory is shown as a negative number (cash outflow), so we need to add a negative sign:\n\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory = -6,100,000.00\n\nHowever, I notice I should double-check this calculation. Let's verify it by analyzing the inventory by product:\n\n### Heavy Equipment A:\n- Purchased: 6 units (3,000,000.00)\n- Sold: 4 units (2,000,000.00)\n- Net: +2 units (1,000,000.00)\n\n### Heavy Equipment B:\n- Purchased: 4 units (3,200,000.00)\n- Sold: 2 units (1,600,000.00)\n- Net: +2 units (1,600,000.00)\n\n### Heavy Equipment C:\n- Purchased: 4 units (4,000,000.00)\n- Sold: 2 units (2,000,000.00)\n- Net: +2 units (2,000,000.00)\n\n### Heavy Equipment D:\n- Purchased: 6 units (9,000,000.00)\n- Sold: 5 units (7,500,000.00)\n- Net: +1 unit (1,500,000.00)\n\nTotal net increase: 6,100,000.00\n\nThis confirms our earlier calculation. For the cash flow statement, this increase in inventory would be shown as:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-6100000.00'} }\n```",
