                        "content": "I need to calculate the property, plant and non-current assets item in the balance sheet, showing both initial and final amounts. Let me analyze the data step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the initial value of non-current assets\nLooking at the data, I can see that there's an initial fixed assets entry:\n- Initial20231231001 with type \"Fixed Assets\" and amount of 8,000,000.00\n\nThis represents the starting balance of non-current assets.\n\n## Step 2: Identify additional fixed asset purchases\nI notice there are several fixed asset purchases:\n- FixedAsset20231231001: Purchase of \"Heavy Machinery4\" for 871,751.87\n- FixedAsset20231231001: Purchase of \"Industrial Facilities5\" for 1,046,775.17\n- FixedAsset20231231001: Purchase of \"Production Line Equipment6\" for 577,494.56\n\nThese add up to a total of 2,496,021.60 in additional fixed assets.\n\n## Step 3: Account for depreciation\nThere are two depreciation entries:\n- Depreciation20240101001: 45,751.31\n- Depreciation20240201002: 93,206.48\n\nTotal depreciation amounts to 138,957.79.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the ending value of non-current assets\nInitial value: 8,000,000.00\nPlus additional purchases: +2,496,021.60\nLess depreciation: -138,957.79\nFinal value: 10,357,063.81\n\nHowever, I need to double-check this. Let me verify if there were any disposals or other transactions affecting fixed assets.\n\nLooking through the data, I don't see any sales or disposals of fixed assets. All the sales appear to be related to equipment inventory (Heavy Equipment A, B, C, D) which are not part of the fixed assets.\n\n## Step 5: Final calculation\nThe initial value is clearly 8,000,000.00.\nThe ending value is: 8,000,000.00 + 2,496,021.60 - 138,957.79 = 10,357,063.81\n\nLet me round to 2 decimal places for the final answer:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '10357063.81'}}",
