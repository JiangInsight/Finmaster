I'll approach this by identifying all income and expense items, then calculate the profit.\n\nLet me break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the total revenue (from sales)\n2. Calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS)\n3. Calculate all operating expenses (administrative, sales, financial expenses)\n4. Calculate other income/expenses (interest, depreciation)\n5. Calculate the profit before tax (Revenue - COGS - Operating Expenses + Other Income - Other Expenses)\n\nLet's start by identifying all sales transactions and their profits:\n\n### Revenue and Profit from Sales\n\nLooking at all Sale transactions:\n- Sale20240103001: profit = 326,403.16\n- Sale20240106004: profit = 184,558.74\n- Sale20240107005: profit = 354,106.17\n- Sale20240108008: profit = 281,910.15\n- Sale20240109009: profit = 570,499.57\n- Sale20240111011: profit = 715,044.89\n- Sale20240117017: profit = 203,009.17\n- Sale20240122024: profit = 152,509.01\n- Sale20240124028: profit = 236,928.63\n- Sale20240125030: profit = 318,422.35\n- Sale20240129034: profit = 452,322.13\n- Sale20240131038: profit = 522,547.30\n- Sale20240205042: profit = 644,176.18\n\nTotal profit from sales: 4,962,437.45\n\n### Operating Expenses\n\n#### Administrative Expenses:\n- Expense20240101001: 31,077.04\n- Expense20240102001: 72,434.17\n- Expense20240103001: 41,635.89\n- Expense20240106001: 19,433.80\n- Expense20240108001: 72,933.80 + 91,530.52 = 164,464.32\n- Expense20240109001: 49,974.11\n- Expense20240112001: 39,503.53\n- Expense20240113001: 64,480.99\n- Expense20240115001: 65,687.23\n- Expense20240116001: 32,249.23\n- Expense20240117001: 35,076.40\n- Expense20240125001: 60,656.12\n- Expense20240130001: 45,589.58\n- Expense20240201001: 55,640.70\n- Expense20240202001: 57,359.96\n- Expense20240204001: 28,406.13\n\nTotal Administrative Expenses: 863,669.20\n\n#### Sales Expenses:\n- Expense20240104001: 57,286.12\n- Expense20240107001: 50,312.93 + 18,529.12 = 68,842.05\n- Expense20240110001: 23,835.49\n- Expense20240111001: 10,656.44 + 79,175.30 = 89,831.74\n- Expense20240113001: 83,043.95\n- Expense20240114001: 30,521.87\n- Expense20240116001: 94,406.29\n- Expense20240118001: 42,974.21\n- Expense20240119001: 81,067.73 + 25,941.18 = 107,008.91\n- Expense20240120001: 21,329.49\n- Expense20240121001: 85,787.82 + 78,068.15 = 163,855.97\n- Expense20240122001: 11,973.24\n- Expense20240123001: 79,415.78 + 29,336.31 = 108,752.09\n- Expense20240124001: 20,565.70\n- Expense20240125001: 16,489.93\n- Expense20240126001: 79,494.60\n- Expense20240127001: 70,681.23\n- Expense20240129001: 14,158.49 + 72,125.70 = 86,284.19\n- Expense20240130001: 68,047.29\n- Expense20240131001: 26,885.73\n- Expense20240203001: 90,337.66 + 32,201.46 = 122,539.12\n\nTotal Sales Expenses: 1,374,076.96\n\n#### Financial Expenses:\n- Expense20240104001: 88,194.75\n- Expense20240105001: 52,101.64\n- Expense20240112001: 52,410.28\n- Expense20240122001: 20,961.18\n- Expense20240128001: 55,124.83\n- Expense20240201001: 52,927.55\n- Expense20240205001: 29,540.71\n\nTotal Financial Expenses: 351,260.94\n\n### Other Income/Expenses\n\n#### Interest Receivables (Income):\nTotal of all interest receivable transactions: 15,368.86\n\n#### Depreciation (Expense):\n- Depreciation20240101001: 45,751.31\n- Depreciation20240201002: 93,206.48\n\nTotal Depreciation: 138,957.79\n\n### Final Profit Before Tax Calculation:\n- Total Profit from Sales: 4,962,437.45\n- Total Administrative Expenses: 863,669.20\n- Total Sales Expenses: 1,374,076.96\n- Total Financial Expenses: 351,260.94\n- Total Interest Receivables (Income): 15,368.86\n- Total Depreciation (Expense): 138,957.79\n\nProfit Before Tax = Profit from Sales + Interest Income - Administrative Expenses - Sales Expenses - Financial Expenses - Depreciation\n= 4,962,437.45 + 15,368.86 - 863,669.20 - 1,374,076.96 - 351,260.94 - 138,957.79\n= 2,249,841.42\n\nHowever, I need to double-check this result. The profit before tax should be derived from all business activities during the period, not just the profit from sales. Let me recalculate:\n\n- Total Revenue (amount from all sales): 16,471,927.76\n- Total COGS (cost_amount from all sales): 11,500,000.00\n- Gross Profit: 4,971,927.76\n- Total Operating Expenses: 2,589,007.10 (Admin + Sales + Financial expenses)\n- Other Income (Interest): 15,368.86\n- Other Expenses (Depreciation): 138,957.79\n\nProfit Before Tax = Gross Profit + Other Income - Operating Expenses - Other Expenses\n= 4,971,927.76 + 15,368.86 - 2,589,007.10 - 138,957.79\n= 2,259,331.73\n\nTo be conservative and align with standard accounting practices, I'll take the last calculation as the most accurate representation of profit before tax.\n\nLooking at the profit figures more carefully, I need to review my calculations again. It looks like I should take the sum of all profit values from the sale transactions directly, which I calculated as 4,962,437.45. Then I need to add interest income (15,368.86) and subtract all expenses (Admin, Sales, Financial, and Depreciation).\n\nProfit Before Tax = 4,962,437.45 + 15,368.86 - 863,669.20 - 1,374,076.96 - 351,260.94 - 138,957.79 \n= 2,249,841.42\n\nChecking both calculations, I see that there's a slight difference. The 'profit' column in the sales transactions already accounts for Revenue - COGS, so I'll use that figure to ensure accuracy.\n\nFinal Profit Before Tax = 2,249,841.42\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Profit Before Tax': '2249841.42'} }\n```",
