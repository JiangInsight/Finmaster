I'll focus on finding internal discrepancies within each transaction.\n\n## Looking at entry Sale20240109007\n\nThis transaction appears to have several inconsistencies:\n\n1. **Type inconsistency**: The transaction ID starts with \"Sale\" but is recorded as \"Sales Expenses\" in the recorded_type field.\n\n2. **Amount inconsistency**: \n   - The invoice states the total amount should be $1,081,640.66\n   - The recorded_amount is $1,144,457.05\n\n3. **Tax amount inconsistency**:\n   - The invoice states tax amount should be $54,082.03\n   - The recorded_tax_amount is $860,709.52 (significantly higher)\n\n4. **Unit price inconsistency**:\n   - The invoice states unit price should be $1,081,640.66\n   - The recorded_unit_price is $992,032.98\n\n5. **Profit calculation**: The recorded values still show correct profit ($281,640.66) which is consistent with the original amount minus cost.\n\nBased on the invoice text: \"On January 09, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $1081640.66, totaling $1081640.66.
