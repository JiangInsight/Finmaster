The cost amount for this transaction was $1000000.00, with a tax amount of $72772.67, leading to a total amount due of $1382680.65. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\nHowever, the recorded_tax_amount is $1229548.22, which is significantly higher than the $72772.67 mentioned in the invoice description.\n\nLet me verify this by calculating the expected tax amount:\n- If the total is $1455453.32 and the after-tax amount is $1382680.65\n- Then the tax would be $1455453.32 - $1382680.65 = $72772.67\n\nThis confirms that the recorded tax amount of $1229548.22 is incorrect, and the correct value based on the invoice should be $72772.67.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': '72772.67', 'Recorded tax': '1229548.22', 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240124024'} }\n```",
