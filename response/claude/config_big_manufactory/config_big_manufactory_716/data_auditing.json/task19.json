I'll pay special attention to the invoice descriptions since they're generally more reliable.\n\nLooking through the data, I found a clear inconsistency in the entry with ID `Expense20240204001`:\n\n1. The `recorded_type` is listed as \"Administrative Expenses\" \n2. However, the invoice description states: \"On February 04, 2024, an invoice was issued for a **Financial Expenses**, totaling $33964.40.\"\n3. Additionally, the `recorded_date` is shown as \"2024-02-06\"\n4. But the invoice description clearly indicates \"On **February 04, 2024**, an invoice was issued...\"\n\nThis means there are two key discrepancies:\n1. The transaction type was incorrectly recorded as \"Administrative Expenses\" when it should be \"Financial Expenses\"\n2. The transaction date was incorrectly recorded as \"2024-02-06\" when it should be \"2024-02-04\"\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Financial Expenses', 'Recorded category': 'Administrative Expenses', 'Original date': '2024-02-04', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-06', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240204001'} }",
