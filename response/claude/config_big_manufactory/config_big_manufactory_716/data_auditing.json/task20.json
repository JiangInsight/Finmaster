The `recorded_type` is \"Sales Expenses\" but invoice describes it as a \"Sale\"\n2. The `recorded_unit_price` (1071802.2) doesn't match what's in the invoice (1081640.66)\n3. The transaction ID \"Sale20240109007\" starts with \"Sale\" but is categorized as \"Sales Expenses\"\n\nFrom the invoice: \"On January 09, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $1081640.66, totaling $1081640.66.\"\n\n## Transaction Initial20231231001 - Multiple entries with same ID\nThis is not necessarily an error, but worth noting that there are three entries with the same ID but different types (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets).\n\n## Other Transactions\nI don't see other clear inconsistencies between the recorded fields and invoice descriptions. The recorded fields align with the details provided in the invoices for other transactions.\n\nTherefore, the main inconsistency is with Sale20240109007:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '1081640.66', 'Recorded price': '1071802.2', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240109007'} }\n```",
