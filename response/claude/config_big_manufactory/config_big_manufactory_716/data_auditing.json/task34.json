Let me analyze this transaction:\n\n1. Transaction ID: Sale20240204039\n2. Recorded type: \"Sales Expenses\" - But the ID starts with \"Sale\" and the invoice description refers to a Sale\n3. Recorded date: \"2024-02-15\" - But the invoice description says \"February 04, 2024\"\n4. Recorded quantity: 0.0 - But the invoice description says \"1.0 units\"\n5. Recorded amount: 0.0 - But the invoice indicates a total of $1431969.88\n6. Recorded unit price: $1523103.98 - But the invoice says $1431969.88\n7. Recorded tax amount: $1357854.33 - This appears excessive compared to the invoice's $71598.49\n8. Profit amount in invoice: $431969.88\n\nThe invoice description clearly states: \"On February 04, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $1431969.88, totaling $1431969.88. The cost amount for this transaction was $1000000.00, with a tax amount of $71598.49, leading to a total amount due of $1360371.39. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nThis doesn't match several of the recorded fields, suggesting multiple errors in this record.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original date': '2024-02-04', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-15', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '1.0', 'Recorded quantity': '0.0', 'Original price': '1431969.88', 'Recorded price': '1523103.98', 'Original receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Original amount': '1431969.88', 'Recorded amount': '0.0', 'Original tax': '71598.49', 'Recorded tax': '1357854.33', 'Original profit': '431969.88', 'Recorded profit': '431969.88', 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240204039'} }\n```",
