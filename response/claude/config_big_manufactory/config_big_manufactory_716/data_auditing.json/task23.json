First, I'll look at the Interest20240114014 transaction:\n   - The recorded_date is 2024-01-14\n   - The recorded_amount is 421.99\n   - The invoice states: \"On January 14, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Interest Receivables, totaling $421.99.\"\n   - No inconsistency detected here.\n\n2. Looking at Interest20240202033:\n   - The recorded_date is 2024-02-17\n   - The recorded_amount is 103.33\n   - The invoice states: \"On February 02, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Interest Receivables, totaling $90.78.\"\n   - Here I found two inconsistencies:\n     1. The date in the invoice (Feb 02) doesn't match the recorded date (Feb 17)\n     2. The amount in the invoice ($90.78) doesn't match the recorded amount ($103.33)\n\nThis transaction has clear discrepancies that need to be reported.\n\nLet me check if there are any other inconsistencies in the data:\n\nNo other inconsistencies found after reviewing the remaining transactions.\n\nMy analysis is complete. The transaction Interest20240202033 shows discrepancies in both date and amount.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-02-02', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-17', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '90.78', 'Recorded amount': '103.33', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Interest20240202033'} }\n```",
