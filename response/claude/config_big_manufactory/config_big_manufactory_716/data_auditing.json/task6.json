First, let me compare the recorded unit price with what's in the invoice description:\n   - Recorded unit price: $1,900,779.50\n   - Invoice states: \"...a unit price of $2,196,931.90, totaling $2,196,931.90.\"\n   \n2. Checking the total amount:\n   - Recorded amount: $2,196,931.90\n   - Unit price Ã— quantity should equal the total amount\n   - Since quantity is 1.0, the unit price should equal the total amount\n\n3. Checking other calculations for consistency:\n   - Tax amount: $109,846.60\n   - After-tax amount: $2,087,085.30\n   - Cost amount: $1,500,000.00\n   - Profit: $696,931.90\n   - These figures are consistent with a unit price of $2,196,931.90, not $1,900,779.50\n\n4. Determining the correct value:\n   - The invoice is considered more reliable and states the price as $2,196,931.90\n   - The total amount recorded ($2,196,931.90) matches this value\n   - The tax calculations, profit calculations, and other figures align with $2,196,931.90 as the unit price\n\nThere's a clear discrepancy between the recorded unit price ($1,900,779.50) and what should be the correct unit price ($2,196,931.90) based on the invoice and the total amount.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '2196931.90', 'Recorded price': '1900779.50', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240128030'} }\n```",
