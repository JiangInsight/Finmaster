From the cash flow statement, I can see that the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is -$10,442,735.47\n\n2. For total debt, I need to look at the liabilities on the balance sheet:\n   - Total Current Liabilities: $8,028,630.43\n   - There are no long-term liabilities/debt shown in the balance sheet\n   - Therefore, Total Debt = $8,028,630.43\n\nNow I can calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -$10,442,735.47 / $8,028,630.43\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -1.30\n\nRounding to two decimal places: -1.30\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.30'}}\n```",
