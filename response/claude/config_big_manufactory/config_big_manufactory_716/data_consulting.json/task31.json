                        "content": "I'll solve this task by calculating each of the required financial ratios step by step.\n\n## 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\nFormula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nFrom the income statement, we have:\n- Net Credit Sales = Main Business Revenue = $28,572,608.70\n\nFor Average Accounts Receivable:\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable = $0\n- Ending Accounts Receivable = $14,921,566.06\n- Average Accounts Receivable = ($0 + $14,921,566.06) / 2 = $7,460,783.03\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $28,572,608.70 / $7,460,783.03 = 3.83\n\n## 2. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay current liabilities from its operations.\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Average Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Operating Cash Flow = -$10,442,735.47\n\nFor Average Current Liabilities:\n- Beginning Current Liabilities = $0\n- Ending Current Liabilities = $8,028,630.43\n- Average Current Liabilities = ($0 + $8,028,630.43) / 2 = $4,014,315.22\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -$10,442,735.47 / $4,014,315.22 = -2.60\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -2.60\n\n## 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\nFormula: Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Sales = $28,572,608.70\n\nFor Average Total Assets:\n- Beginning Total Assets = $28,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets = $39,772,748.32\n- Average Total Assets = ($28,000,000.00 + $39,772,748.32) / 2 = $33,886,374.16\n\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = $28,572,608.70 / $33,886,374.16 = 0.84\n\n## 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures a company's financial leverage.\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities (end date) = $8,028,630.43\n- Total Equity (end date) = $31,744,117.89\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $8,028,630.43 / $31,744,117.89 = 0.25\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.83', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-2.60', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.60', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.84', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.25'} }\n```",
