                        "content": "I'll solve this step by step, calculating the three requested financial ratios from the provided statements.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nThis ratio shows the relationship between operating cash flow and net income.\n\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Net Income\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -10,442,735.47\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = 3,744,117.89\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = -10,442,735.47 / 3,744,117.89 = -2.79\n\n## 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio (or Turnover Ratio)\n\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate revenue.\n\nFormula: Total Revenue / Average Current Assets\n\nFrom the financial statements:\n- Total Revenue = 28,572,608.70\n- Initial Current Assets = 20,000,000.00\n- End Current Assets = 29,413,723.95\n- Average Current Assets = (20,000,000.00 + 29,413,723.95) / 2 = 24,706,861.98\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = 28,572,608.70 / 24,706,861.98 = 1.16\n\n## 3. Quick Ratio\n\nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n\nFormula: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet (using end amounts):\n- Current Assets = 29,413,723.95\n- Inventory = 7,400,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43\n\nQuick Ratio = (29,413,723.95 - 7,400,000.00) / 8,028,630.43 = 22,013,723.95 / 8,028,630.43 = 2.74\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-2.79', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '1.16', 'Quick Ratio': '2.74'}}\n```",
