Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -10,442,735.47\n2. Capital Expenditures (Purchase of Fixed Assets) = 2,479,994.53\n\nTherefore:\nFCF = -10,442,735.47 - 2,479,994.53 = -12,922,730.00\n\nI can verify this is correct by looking at the Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents, which is -12,922,730.00, matching our calculated FCF.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-12922730.00'}}\n```",
