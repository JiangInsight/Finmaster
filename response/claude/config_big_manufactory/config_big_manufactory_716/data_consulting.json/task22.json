It's calculated as:\n\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = $29,413,723.95\n- Inventory = $7,400,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = $8,028,630.43\n\nQuick Ratio = ($29,413,723.95 - $7,400,000.00) / $8,028,630.43\nQuick Ratio = $22,013,723.95 / $8,028,630.43\nQuick Ratio = 2.74 (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the Net Profit Margin\nThe Net Profit Margin measures how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = $3,744,117.89\n- Total Revenue = $28,572,608.70\n\nNet Profit Margin = ($3,744,117.89 / $28,572,608.70) × 100%\nNet Profit Margin = 0.1310 × 100%\nNet Profit Margin = 13.10% (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '2.74', 'Net Profit Margin': '13.10%'}}\n```",
