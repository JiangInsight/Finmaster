                        "content": "I need to calculate several financial ratios based on the provided financial statements. Let's solve this step by step.\n\n1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n   FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures\n   Operating Cash Flow = -10,442,735.47\n   Capital Expenditures = 2,479,994.53\n   FCF = -10,442,735.47 - 2,479,994.53 = -12,922,730.00\n\n2. Return on Assets (ROA)\n   ROA = Net Income / Average Total Assets × 100%\n   Net Income = 3,744,117.89\n   Average Total Assets = (28,000,000.00 + 39,772,748.32) / 2 = 33,886,374.16\n   ROA = (3,744,117.89 / 33,886,374.16) × 100% = 11.05%\n\n3. Return on Equity (ROE)\n   ROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity × 100%\n   Net Income = 3,744,117.89\n   Average Shareholders' Equity = (28,000,000.00 + 31,744,117.89) / 2 = 29,872,058.95\n   ROE = (3,744,117.89 / 29,872,058.95) × 100% = 12.53%\n\n4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n   Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Net Income\n   Operating Cash Flow = -10,442,735.47\n   Net Income = 3,744,117.89\n   Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = -10,442,735.47 / 3,744,117.89 = -2.79\n\n5. Net Profit Margin\n   Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Total Revenue × 100%\n   Net Income = 3,744,117.89\n   Total Revenue = 28,572,608.70\n   Net Profit Margin = (3,744,117.89 / 28,572,608.70) × 100% = 13.10%\n\n6. Gross Profit Margin\n   Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Total Revenue × 100%\n   Gross Profit = 8,372,608.70\n   Total Revenue = 28,572,608.70\n   Gross Profit Margin = (8,372,608.70 / 28,572,608.70) × 100% = 29.30%\n\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-12922730.00', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '11.05%', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '12.53%', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-2.79', 'Net Profit Margin': '13.10%', 'Gross Profit Margin': '29.30%'} }",
