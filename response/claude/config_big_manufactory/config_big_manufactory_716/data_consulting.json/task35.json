                        "content": "I need to calculate several financial ratios based on the given financial statements. Let me work through each ratio step by step.\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\nCurrent Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\nCurrent Ratio = $29,413,723.95 / $8,028,630.43 = 3.66\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\nGross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\nGross Profit Margin = ($8,372,608.70 / $28,572,608.70) × 100% = 29.30%\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\nTotal Liabilities = $8,028,630.43 (only current liabilities are present)\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $8,028,630.43 / $39,772,748.32 = 0.20\n\n### 4. Net Profit Margin\nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\nNet Profit Margin = ($3,744,117.89 / $28,572,608.70) × 100% = 13.10%\n\n### 5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = (Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits) / Total Current Liabilities\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = ($6,057,264.53 + $1,020,005.47) / $8,028,630.43 = $7,077,270.00 / $8,028,630.43 = 0.88\n\n### 6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nFree Cash Flow = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures\nFCF = -$10,442,735.47 - $2,479,994.53 = -$12,922,730.00\n(This matches the \"Net Increase\" value in the cash flow statement)\n\n### 7. Return on Assets (ROA)\nROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) × 100%\nROA = ($3,744,117.89 / $39,772,748.32) × 100% = 9.41%\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '3.66', 'Gross Profit Margin': '29.30%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.20', 'Net Profit Margin': '13.10%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '0.88', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-12922730.00', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '9.41%'} }\n```",
