                        "content": "I'll calculate the requested financial ratios based on the provided financial statements. Let me work through each ratio step by step.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to cover current liabilities with its operating cash flow.\n- Operating Cash Flow: -$10,442,735.47\n- Current Liabilities: $8,028,630.43\n- Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities = -10,442,735.47 / 8,028,630.43 = -1.30\n\n## 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures a company's financial leverage.\n- Total Liabilities: $8,028,630.43 (only current liabilities in this case)\n- Total Equity: $31,744,117.89\n- Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Equity = 8,028,630.43 / 31,744,117.89 = 0.25\n\n## 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n- Revenue: $28,572,608.70\n- Average Total Assets: (Initial Assets + Ending Assets) / 2 = (28,000,000 + 39,772,748.32) / 2 = $33,886,374.16\n- Ratio = Revenue / Average Total Assets = 28,572,608.70 / 33,886,374.16 = 0.84\n\n## 4. Quick Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n- Quick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = $29,413,723.95 - $7,400,000 = $22,013,723.95\n- Current Liabilities: $8,028,630.43\n- Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities = 22,013,723.95 / 8,028,630.43 = 2.74\n\n## 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio calculated above.\n- Ratio = -1.30\n\n## 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\nThis measures a company's profitability relative to its equity.\n- Net Income: $3,744,117.89\n- Average Equity: (Initial Equity + Ending Equity) / 2 = (28,000,000 + 31,744,117.89) / 2 = $29,872,058.95\n- ROE = Net Income / Average Equity = 3,744,117.89 / 29,872,058.95 = 0.1253 or 12.53%\n\n## 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company collects payments from customers.\n- Revenue: $28,572,608.70\n- Average Accounts Receivable: (Initial AR + Ending AR) / 2 = (0 + 14,921,566.06) / 2 = $7,460,783.03\n- Ratio = Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable = 28,572,608.70 / 7,460,783.03 = 3.83\n\nNow I'll present these calculations in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.30', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.25', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.84', 'Quick Ratio': '2.74', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.30', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '12.53%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.83'} }\n```",
