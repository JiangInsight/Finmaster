First, the Debt to Asset Ratio:\n   - This ratio measures how much of a company's assets are financed by debt\n   - Formula: Total Debt / Total Assets\n\n2. Second, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:\n   - This ratio measures the relationship between operating cash flow and net income\n   - Formula: Operating Cash Flow / Net Income (using absolute values)\n\nLet's calculate each ratio:\n\n**Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = $8,028,630.43\n- Total Assets = $39,772,748.32\n- Debt to Asset Ratio = 8,028,630.43 / 39,772,748.32 = 0.202 (rounded to 2 decimal places is 0.20)\n\n**Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$10,442,735.47\n- Net Income = $3,744,117.89\n- Ratio = |-10,442,735.47| / |3,744,117.89| = 2.789 (rounded to 2 decimal places is 2.79)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.20', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '2.79'} }\n```",
