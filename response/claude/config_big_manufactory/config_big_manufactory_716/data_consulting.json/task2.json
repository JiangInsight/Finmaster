Current Assets:\n   - End amount = $29,413,723.95\n\n2. Inventory:\n   - End amount = $7,400,000.00\n\n3. Current Liabilities:\n   - End amount = $8,028,630.43\n\nNow I'll calculate the Quick Ratio:\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\nQuick Ratio = ($29,413,723.95 - $7,400,000.00) / $8,028,630.43\nQuick Ratio = $22,013,723.95 / $8,028,630.43\nQuick Ratio = 2.74\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 2.74\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '2.74'}}\n```",
