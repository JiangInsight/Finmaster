                        "content": "I need to calculate the property, plant and non-current assets values for both the initial and ending periods.\n\n## Step 1: Identify initial non-current assets\nLooking at the data, I can see that the initial non-current assets value is mentioned in this line:\n```\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 8000000.0 | 8000000.0 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n```\n\nSo the initial value is 8,000,000.00.\n\n## Step 2: Identify changes to non-current assets during the period\nThere are two types of transactions that affect the non-current assets:\n1. Fixed Assets Purchases\n2. Depreciation\n\n### Fixed Assets Purchases:\n```\n| FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 758493.61 | 758493.61 |  |  | Paid | Bank Transfer |  | S008 | Supplier 8 |  |  |  |  |  | Production Line Equipment4 | Production Line Equipment |  |  |  |  |  |\n```\n\nSo there was a purchase of Production Line Equipment for 758,493.61.\n\n### Depreciation:\nThere are two depreciation entries:\n```\n| Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45749.96 | 45749.96 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Depreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | 2024-02-01 | 2024-02-01 | 75220.2 | 75220.2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n```\n\nTotal depreciation = 45,749.96 + 75,220.2 = 120,970.16\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the ending non-current assets value\nEnding value = Initial value + Fixed Asset Purchases - Depreciation\nEnding value = 8,000,000.00 + 758,493.61 - 120,970.16 = 8,637,523.45\n\n## Step 4: Format as required\n\nHowever, I need to double-check my work. Looking at the example provided, I noticed that there might be other fixed asset purchases I missed. Let me check again carefully.\n\nUpon reviewing the data again, I don't see any other fixed asset purchases apart from the one I identified. The initial fixed assets are 8,000,000.00, there's one fixed asset purchase of 758,493.61, and two depreciation entries totaling 120,970.16.\n\nTherefore, the ending value is 8,637,523.45.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '8637523.45'} }\n```",
