I'll analyze all the sales transactions that use \"Account Receivable\" as the receive method.\n\nLet me first identify all sales transactions with \"Account Receivable\" as the receive method:\n\n1. Sale20240103001: 1,411,983.38 (Unpaid)\n2. Sale20240106004: 1,180,660.04 (Unpaid)  \n3. Sale20240107006: 2,183,357.44 (Unpaid)\n4. Sale20240109007: 1,081,640.66 (Unpaid)\n5. Sale20240121022: 2,170,939.20 (Unpaid)\n6. Sale20240127028: 1,384,684.30 (Unpaid)\n7. Sale20240130032: 2,101,413.12 (Unpaid)\n8. Sale20240203036: 1,974,918.04 (Unpaid)\n9. Sale20240204039: 1,431,969.88 (Unpaid)\n\nNow I'll sum up these amounts to find the total increase in Accounts Receivable:\n1,411,983.38 + 1,180,660.04 + 2,183,357.44 + 1,081,640.66 + 2,170,939.20 + 1,384,684.30 + 2,101,413.12 + 1,974,918.04 + 1,431,969.88 = 14,921,566.06\n\nSince these are all new receivables created during the period and there's no evidence of collections of previous receivables, this represents an increase in Accounts Receivable.\n\nFor a cash flow statement, an increase in Accounts Receivable is shown as a negative number (since it reduces cash flow), so the figure would be:\n(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable = -14,921,566.06\n\nHowever, I noticed there might be a rounding issue when adding these large numbers. Let me calculate again with more precision:\n\nSum = -14,921,566.06\n\nFor the cash flow statement, I need to present this as a negative number since an increase in accounts receivable represents cash that was earned but not received, thus reducing operating cash flow.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-14921566.06'} }\n```",
