                        "content": "I need to calculate the gross profit from the provided transaction data. Gross profit is calculated as sales revenue minus the cost of goods sold.\n\nLet me identify all sales transactions and sum up their revenue and costs:\n\n1. First, I'll find all sales transactions by looking for rows with \"type\" equal to \"Sale\".\n2. For each sale, I'll extract the revenue (amount) and the cost of goods sold (cost_amount).\n3. Then I'll calculate the gross profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.\n\nLooking through the data, I can identify these sale transactions:\n\n1. Sale20240103001: amount = 1,411,983.38, cost_amount = 1,000,000.00\n2. Sale20240106004: amount = 1,180,660.04, cost_amount = 800,000.00\n3.

Sale20240204039: amount = 1,431,969.88, cost_amount = 1,000,000.00\n\nLet me sum up the revenues and costs:\n\nTotal Revenue = 28,572,608.70\nTotal Cost of Goods Sold = 20,200,000.00\n\nGross Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost of Goods Sold\nGross Profit = 28,572,608.70 - 20,200,000.00 = 8,372,608.70\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: 8,372,608.70\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit': '8372608.70'} }\n```",
