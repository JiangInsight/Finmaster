Expenses paid in cash:\n   - Administrative Expenses: 1,754,066.25 (sum of all administrative expenses)\n   - Sales Expenses: 946,227.43 (sum of all sales expenses)\n   - Financial Expenses: 503,234.20 (sum of all financial expenses)\n   Total expenses paid in cash: 3,203,527.88\n\n5. Cash to bank transfers:\n   - Various Transfer20240121001 through Transfer20240131001: 7,000,000.0\n   Total cash to bank transfers: 7,000,000.0\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the net cash flow\nLet's calculate the net impact on cash and cash equivalents:\n\nInitial cash and cash equivalents: 20,000,000.0\n\nCash Inflows:\n- Cash sales: +13,651,042.64\n- Bank to cash transfers: +2,000,000.0\nTotal inflows: +15,651,042.64\n\nCash Outflows:\n- Cash purchases: -6,860,000.0\n- Fixed asset purchases by bank: -2,479,994.53\n- Purchases by bank transfer: -14,500,000.0\n- Expenses paid in cash: -3,203,527.88\n- Cash to bank transfers: -7,000,000.0\nTotal outflows: -34,043,522.41\n\nNet cash flow = Total inflows - Total outflows\nNet cash flow = 15,651,042.64 - 34,043,522.41 = -18,392,479.77\n\nNote: Bank to cash transfers and cash to bank transfers are internal movements that don't affect the total cash and cash equivalents. However, I've included them in the calculation for completeness, and they should net to -5,000,000.0.\n\nThe net decrease in cash and cash equivalents is 18,392,479.77.\n\nHowever, let me double-check this against the ending balance approach:\n\nInitial cash and cash equivalents: 20,000,000.0\nNet change: -18,392,479.77\nFinal cash and cash equivalents: 1,607,520.23\n\nThis number represents the difference between the initial balance and all the cash flows, showing a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nLet me verify by looking at the cash and bank balances separately:\n\nCash: 5,000,000 (initial) - 6,860,000 (purchases) - 3,203,527.88 (expenses) + 2,000,000 (from bank) - 7,000,000 (to bank) + 13,651,042.64 (sales) = 3,587,514.76\n\nBank: 15,000,000 (initial) - 2,479,994.53 (fixed assets) - 14,500,000 (purchases) - 2,000,000 (to cash) + 7,000,000 (from cash) = 3,020,005.47\n\nTotal ending cash and equivalents: 3,587,514.76 + 3,020,005.47 = 6,607,520.23\n\nThe difference between initial (20,000,000) and ending (6,607,520.23) is 13,392,479.77.\n\nAfter rechecking my calculations, I realized I had an error in the bank calculations. After adjusting, the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents appears to be 13,392,479.77.\n\nTherefore, the net increase (which would be a negative number since it's a decrease) in cash and cash equivalents is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Increase': '-13392479.77'}}\n```\n\nActually, let me do a more precise calculation, tracking each transaction that affects cash or bank balance:\n\nInitial Cash: 5,000,000.0\nInitial Bank: 15,000,000.0\n\nAfter all transactions:\n- Cash inflows from sales: +13,651,042.64\n- Cash outflows for purchases: -6,860,000.0\n- Cash outflows for expenses: -3,203,527.88\n- Net transfers (cash to bank): -5,000,000.0\n- Bank outflows for fixed assets: -2,479,994.53\n- Bank outflows for purchases: -14,500,000.0\n\nFinal Cash: 5,000,000 + 13,651,042.64 - 6,860,000.0 - 3,203,527.88 - 5,000,000.0 = 3,587,514.76\nFinal Bank: 15,000,000 - 2,479,994.53 - 14,500,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 = 3,020,005.47\n\nFinal Total Cash and Equivalents: 3,587,514.76 + 3,020,005.47 = 6,607,520.23\nNet Increase: 6,607,520.23 - 20,000,000.0 = -13,392,479.77\n\n{\"solution\": {'Net Increase': '-13392479.77'}}",
