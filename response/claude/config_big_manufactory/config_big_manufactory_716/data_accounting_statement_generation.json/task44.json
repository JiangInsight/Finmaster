First, I'll identify all fixed assets purchase transactions in the data.\n2. I'll look for transactions with the type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\".\n3. Sum up the amounts of these transactions.\n\nLooking through the data, I can see the following fixed asset purchases:\n\n1. FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 758493.61 | 758493.61 |  |  | Paid | Bank Transfer |  | S008 | Supplier 8 |  |  |  |  |  | Production Line Equipment4 | Production Line Equipment\n\n2. FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 1721500.92 | 1721500.92 |  |  | Paid | Bank Transfer |  | S009 | Supplier 9 |  |  |  |  |  | Industrial Facilities5 | Industrial Facilities\n\nThese are the only two transactions with the type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" in the data.\n\nTo calculate the final purchase of fixed assets, I need to sum up these amounts:\n758493.61 + 1721500.92 = 2,479,994.53\n\nLet me verify this is the approach needed based on the example. In the example solution, there was only one fixed asset purchase of 305354.43, and that was the answer. This confirms my approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final purchase of fixed assets in the cash flow statement is 2,479,994.53.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '2479994.53'}}\n```",
