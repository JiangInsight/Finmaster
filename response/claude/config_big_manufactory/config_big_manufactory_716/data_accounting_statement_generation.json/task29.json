Transaction ID: Expense20240110001, Type: Financial Expenses, Amount: 60,049.63\n2. Transaction ID: Expense20240111001, Type: Financial Expenses, Amount: 52,391.74\n3.

Transaction ID: Expense20240204001, Type: Financial Expenses, Amount: 33,964.40\n\nNow I'll sum up all these financial expense transactions:\n60,049.63 + 52,391.74 + 69,569.70 + 36,380.83 + 66,912.09 + 52,734.73 + 33,964.40 = 372,003.12\n\nTherefore, the total financial expenses for the income statement is $372,003.12.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Financial Expenses': '372003.12'} }\n```",
