                        "content": "I need to calculate the final total cost item in the income statement from the transactions data.\n\nStep 1: Let me identify the cost items in an income statement. The total cost typically includes:\n- Cost of goods sold (related to products sold)\n- Administrative expenses\n- Sales expenses\n- Financial expenses\n- Depreciation\n\nStep 2: Now I'll identify and sum all relevant cost transactions from the data:\n\n1. Cost of Goods Sold:\n   Looking at the sales transactions, I see that each sale has a \"cost_amount\" field which represents the cost of the goods sold.\n   I need to add up all the cost_amount values from sales transactions:\n   - Sales with \"Heavy Equipment A\": 500,000 × 2 = 1,000,000\n   - Sales with \"Heavy Equipment B\": 800,000 × 5 = 4,000,000\n   - Sales with \"Heavy Equipment C\": 1,000,000 × 5 = 5,000,000\n   - Sales with \"Heavy Equipment D\": 1,500,000 × 8 = 12,000,000\n   Total COGS = 22,000,000\n\n2. Administrative Expenses:\n   Adding up all the \"Administrative Expenses\" transactions:\n   46,517.71 + 83,454.23 + 33,781.67 + 32,999.84 + 10,564.48 + 76,852.11 + 79,898.85 + 33,141.79 + 90,795.92 + 19,703.65 + 79,293.14 + 89,732.07 + 39,891.05 + 72,945.61 + 67,136.76 + 87,087.28 + 23,299.79 + 78,951.08 + 39,097.33 + 79,524.95 + 10,275.59 + 25,487.02 + 63,593.73 + 82,900.73 + 66,892.65 = 1,513,819.03\n\n3. Sales Expenses:\n   Adding up all the \"Sales Expenses\" transactions:\n   76,455.38 + 19,956.10 + 66,794.44 + 51,086.01 + 41,117.40 + 68,725.40 + 34,107.04 + 99,827.65 + 16,630.45 + 35,294.97 + 69,032.68 + 28,346.48 + 41,705.41 + 69,296.99 + 57,454.13 + 60,968.71 + 18,674.79 + 98,116.24 + 86,216.74 + 46,127.65 + 20,182.64 = 1,106,117.30\n\n4. Financial Expenses:\n   Adding up all the \"Financial Expenses\" transactions:\n   60,049.63 + 52,391.74 + 69,569.70 + 36,380.83 + 66,912.09 + 52,734.73 + 33,964.40 = 372,003.12\n\n5. Depreciation:\n   45,749.96 + 75,220.20 = 120,970.16\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total cost by adding all the components:\nTotal Cost = COGS + Administrative Expenses + Sales Expenses + Financial Expenses + Depreciation\nTotal Cost = 22,000,000 + 1,513,819.03 + 1,106,117.30 + 372,003.12 + 120,970.16\nTotal Cost = 25,112,909.61\n\nHowever, I notice that the expected output format should be rounded to 2 decimal places. So the final total cost would be 25,112,909.61, which rounded to 2 decimal places is 25,112,909.61.\n\nWait, I need to reconsider my approach. Looking at the example solution, I see that the value is 4,410,000.00, which is much smaller than what I calculated.\n\nLet me reconsider what's being asked. For an income statement, the total cost typically refers to COGS (Cost of Goods Sold). So I should focus on this value.\n\nLooking at the purchases:\n- Purchase of Heavy Equipment A: 500,000 × 4 = 2,000,000\n- Purchase of Heavy Equipment B: 800,000 × 9 = 7,200,000\n- Purchase of Heavy Equipment C: 1,000,000 × 5 = 5,000,000\n- Purchase of Heavy Equipment D: 1,500,000 × 10 = 15,000,000\n\nTotal Purchase Cost = 29,200,000\n\nBut this still doesn't match. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLooking at the examples, I think the task is asking for the total cost of purchases (not necessarily related to sales).\n\nAdding up all \"Purchase\" transaction amounts:\n1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 3,000,000 + 1,600,000 + 800,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,600,000 + 1,500,000 + 500,000 + 1,500,000 + 2,000,000 + 500,000 + 3,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 3,000,000 = 24,000,000\n\nThis is still not matching.\n\nReconsidering one more time, I believe the most likely interpretation is that we are looking for the total cost of all products available for sale (inventory):\n\nTotal Product Cost = 24,000,000 (all purchases)\n\nSince the example shows \"4,410,000.00\" as the answer, I'm going to assume this is the specific format needed and that the correct answer is 24,000,000.00 rounded to 2 decimal places: 24,000,000.00.\n\nActually, I notice that in the example problem, some products had \"cost_per_unit\" values, and I should be calculating based on that. Let me try again:\n\nThe total cost should be the sum of (cost_per_unit × quantity) for all purchased items:\n\nFrom the purchases:\n1,000,000 × 1 + 1,000,000 × 1 + 1,000,000 × 1 + 1,500,000 × 1 + 1,500,000 × 2 + 800,000 × 2 + 800,000 × 1 + 500,000 × 2 + 800,000 × 2 + 1,500,000 × 1 + 500,000 × 1 + 1,500,000 × 1 + 1,000,000 × 2 + 500,000 × 1 + 1,500,000 × 2 + 1,500,000 × 1 + 1,500,000 × 2 = 24,000,000\n\nSo the total cost is 24,000,000.00\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Cost': '24000000.00'}}",
