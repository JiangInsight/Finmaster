                        "content": "I need to calculate the accumulated depreciation for the balance sheet based on the transaction data.\n\nLet me analyze the data to find all depreciation-related transactions:\n\n1. First, I'll identify any initial accumulated depreciation value (at the beginning of the period)\n2. Then, I'll find all depreciation transactions during the period\n3. Finally, I'll calculate the ending accumulated depreciation value\n\nLooking through the data:\n\n- The period seems to start on December 31, 2023 with initial deposits and fixed assets\n- I need to look for any transactions with type \"Depreciation\"\n\nI can see two depreciation entries:\n- On January 1, 2024: `Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45749.96 | 45749.96`\n- On February 1, 2024: `Depreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | 2024-02-01 | 2024-02-01 | 75220.2 | 75220.2`\n\nSince accumulated depreciation is a cumulative account:\n- Initial value: 0.00 (no opening accumulated depreciation entry found)\n- Depreciation on January 1: 45749.96\n- Depreciation on February 1: 75220.2\n- End value: 0.00 + 45749.96 + 75220.2 = 120970.16\n\nHowever, let me double-check if there's any initial accumulated depreciation. Since there's no explicit initial accumulated depreciation entry, and the fixed assets appear to be recorded at gross value (not net of depreciation), I can confirm the initial value is 0.00.\n\nSo the accumulated depreciation calculation is:\n- Initial Value: 0.00\n- End Value: 120970.16\n\nBut wait, I notice that the task description specifically asks for \"initial and final amounts\". The final amount requested might be just through the end of January, not including the February 1 entry.\n\nSince the data shows a continuous timeline from December 31, 2023 through early February 2024, and the first depreciation entry appears on January 1, 2024, the appropriate accumulated depreciation values would be:\n\n- Initial Value (December 31, 2023): 0.00\n- End Value (January 31, 2024): 45749.96\n\nLet me provide the solution according to this interpretation:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accumulated Depreciation End Value': '45749.96'} }\n```",
