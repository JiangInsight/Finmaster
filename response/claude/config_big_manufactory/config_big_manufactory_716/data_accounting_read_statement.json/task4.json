In accounting, this is typically listed as \"Interest Receivable\" - which represents interest that has been earned but not yet collected.\n\nIn the balance sheet provided, I can see the line item \"Interest Receivable\" with:\n- Initial amount: 0.00 on 2023-12-31\n- End amount: 14887.89 on 2024-02-05\n\nTherefore, the interest accrued but not yet received has an initial value of 0.00 and an end value of 14887.89.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '14887.89'}}\n```",
