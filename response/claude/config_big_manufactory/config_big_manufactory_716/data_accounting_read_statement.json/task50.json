Reduction in inventory\n3. Net cash flow from investing activities\n4. Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n\nLet me analyze the statement step by step:\n\n1. The depreciation is clearly listed as \"Depreciation\" with a value of 120970.16\n\n2. The reduction in inventory is listed as \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with a value of -7400000.00 (negative because it's an increase in inventory)\n\n3. The net cash flow from investing activities is listed as \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with a value of -2479994.53 (negative because it represents cash outflow)\n\n4. The net increase in cash and cash equivalents is listed as \"Net Increase\" with a value of -12922730.00 (negative because it's actually a decrease)\n\nThese values appear in the same order as in the original statement.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '120970.16', 'value2': '-7400000.00', 'value3': '-2479994.53', 'value4': '-12922730.00'} }\n```",
