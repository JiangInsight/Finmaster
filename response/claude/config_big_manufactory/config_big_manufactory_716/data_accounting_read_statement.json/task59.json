The net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nLooking at the financial statements:\n\n1. For interest accrued but not yet received:\n   - In the balance sheet, I see \"Interest Receivable\" with an end amount of 14887.89\n   - This represents interest that has been earned but not yet received\n\n2. For net addition in cash and cash equivalents:\n   - In the cash flow statement, I see \"Net Increase\" in the Cash and Cash Equivalents section with an amount of -12922730.00\n   - The negative number indicates a decrease in cash during the period\n\nTherefore, the values I need to extract are:\n- value1 (interest accrued but not received): 14887.89\n- value2 (net addition in cash and cash equivalents): -12922730.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '14887.89', 'value2': '-12922730.00'}}\n```",
