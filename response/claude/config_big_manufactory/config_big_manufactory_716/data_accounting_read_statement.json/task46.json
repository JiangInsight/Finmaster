The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is reported as -2,479,994.53\n\nThis negative value indicates that the company spent money on investing activities rather than generating cash from them. The investing activities section relates to acquisition and disposal of long-term assets, which matches what I need to identify.\n\nThe sub-item is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" at 2,479,994.53 (positive value representing the expenditure).\n\nTherefore:\n- The value of net cash flow from investing activities is -2,479,994.53\n- The sub-item value (Purchase of Fixed Assets) is 2,479,994.53\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2479994.53', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '2479994.53'}}}\n```",
