Retained earnings represent the accumulated profits that have been retained in the business rather than paid out as dividends to shareholders.\n\nFrom the balance sheet data:\n- The initial value of Retained Earnings as of 2023-12-31 is 0.00\n- The end value of Retained Earnings as of 2024-02-05 is 3744117.89\n\nThis shows that during this period, the company retained 3,744,117.89 in earnings rather than distributing them to shareholders.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3744117.89'}}\n```",
