I need to find the line item related to accounts receivable, since accounts receivable represents money owed to the entity by customers who purchased goods or services on credit.\n2. In the statement, I can see \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with a value of \"-14921566.06\"\n3. The negative value indicates an increase in accounts receivable (since it's presented as \"(Increase) Decrease\")\n4. Therefore, accounts receivable increased by 14921566.06 during the period, meaning more customers owe money to the entity\n\nThe task is specifically asking for the decrease in amounts owed to the entity, which would be the value of the \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" line item.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-14921566.06'}}\n```",
