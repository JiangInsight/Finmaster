The negative sign indicates that this was an increase in inventory during the period, rather than a decrease.\n\nIn cash flow statement terms, an increase in inventory is considered a reduction in cash (hence the negative sign). This matches what we're looking for - the reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business (inventory).\n\nTherefore, the value we're looking for is \"-7400000.00\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-7400000.00'}}\n```",
