                        "content": "I need to identify the line items that represent cash available for day-to-day operations in the balance sheet.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, I can see two potential cash-related accounts:\n1. \"Cash on Hand\" - Initial: 5,000,000.00, End: 6,057,264.53\n2. \"Bank Deposits\" - Initial: 15,000,000.00, End: 1,020,005.47\n\nBoth of these represent cash that would typically be available for day-to-day operations. Cash on hand refers to physical cash, while bank deposits are cash in bank accounts that can be readily accessed.\n\nIn financial accounting, these two accounts together represent the entity's cash position for operational use. Therefore, I need to combine these values:\n\nInitial value:\n- Cash on Hand: 5,000,000.00\n- Bank Deposits: 15,000,000.00\n- Total: 20,000,000.00\n\nEnd value:\n- Cash on Hand: 6,057,264.53\n- Bank Deposits: 1,020,005.47\n- Total: 7,077,270.00\n\nHowever, looking at the example provided, it appears that the task is specifically asking for \"Cash on Hand\" only, not the combined value. The example solution only used the \"Cash on Hand\" values.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '6057264.53'}}\n```",
