Addition in amount owed by the entity for goods or services (accounts payable)\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- \"Paid-in Capital\" represents capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares: 28000000.00\n- \"Accounts Payable\" shows the amount owed by the entity for goods or services: 6600000.00\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- \"Profit Before Tax\" shows the profit or loss before deducting tax expense: 5172748.32\n\nThese three items correspond to the requirements in the task description. I'll organize them according to the format requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28000000.00', 'value2': '5172748.32', 'value3': '6600000.00'} }\n```",
