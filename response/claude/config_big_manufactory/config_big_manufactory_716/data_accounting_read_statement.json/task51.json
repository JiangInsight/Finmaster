First, I'll check the balance sheet for any accounts related to accrued interest that has not yet been received.\n   - In the balance sheet, I see \"Interest Receivable\" with Initial_amount of 0.00 (2023-12-31) and End_amount of 14887.89 (2024-02-05).\n\n2. To confirm this is the correct account, I'll check the cash flow statement:\n   - In the cash flow statement, there's a line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" with an amount of -14887.89, which matches the end value in the balance sheet.\n\n3. Additionally, the income statement shows \"Interest Income\" of 14887.89, which corresponds to the interest earned during this period.\n\nThe \"Interest Receivable\" account represents interest that has been earned (accrued) but not yet received in cash. The initial value was 0.00 and the end value is 14887.89.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '14887.89'}}\n```",
