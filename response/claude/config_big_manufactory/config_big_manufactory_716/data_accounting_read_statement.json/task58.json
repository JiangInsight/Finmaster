From the balance sheet:\n   - Cash on Hand (Initial): 5,000,000.00\n   - Bank Deposits (Initial): 15,000,000.00\n\n2. From the cash flow statement:\n   - Beginning Balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents: 20,000,000.00\n\nThe cash flow statement explicitly states the beginning balance of cash and cash equivalents as 20,000,000.00, which matches the sum of the initial Cash on Hand and Bank Deposits from the balance sheet (5,000,000 + 15,000,000 = 20,000,000).\n\nTherefore, the value of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period is 20,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '20000000.00'}}\n```",
