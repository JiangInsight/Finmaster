This represents the net change in inventory during the period.\n\n## Step 1: Identify all inventory purchases\nLooking at the transactions, I need to find all \"Purchase\" transactions related to inventory items:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001: Heavy Equipment C - 2 units × $1,000,000 = $2,000,000\n2. Purchase20231231002: Heavy Equipment D - 1 unit × $1,500,000 = $1,500,000\n3. Purchase20231231003: Heavy Equipment B - 2 units × $800,000 = $1,600,000\n4. Purchase20231231004: Heavy Equipment A - 1 unit × $500,000 = $500,000\n5. Purchase20231231005: Heavy Equipment A - 2 units × $500,000 = $1,000,000\n6. Purchase20231231006: Heavy Equipment D - 1 unit × $1,500,000 = $1,500,000\n7.

Sale20240205041: Heavy Equipment C - Cost: $1,000,000\n\nTotal cost of goods sold: $16,900,000\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the net change in inventory\nIncrease in Inventory = Total Purchases - Total Cost of Goods Sold\nIncrease in Inventory = $22,000,000 - $16,900,000 = $5,100,000\n\nSince this is an increase in inventory (negative cash flow), for the cash flow statement, we need to show it as a negative number:\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory = -$5,100,000\n\nHowever, the final value should be presented with exactly two decimal places, so:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-5100000.00'} }\n```",
