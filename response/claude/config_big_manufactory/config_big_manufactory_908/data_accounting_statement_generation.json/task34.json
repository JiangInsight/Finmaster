Let me break this down into revenue, cost of goods sold, and all expenses to determine the final net profit.\n\n## Step 1: Identify all revenue from sales\nFirst, I'll identify all sales transactions and calculate total revenue.\n\nSales transactions have the type \"Sale\" and include the profit amount:\n\n- 2024-01-03: Sale - $1,302,111.59 (profit: $302,111.59)\n- 2024-01-08: Sale - $1,460,946.33 (profit: $460,946.33)\n- 2024-01-09: Sale - $1,489,365.79 (profit: $489,365.79)\n- 2024-01-15: Sale - $674,738.01 (profit: $174,738.01)\n- 2024-01-16: Sale - $651,423.21 (profit: $151,423.21)\n- 2024-01-17: Sale - $1,124,652.91 (profit: $324,652.91)\n- 2024-01-18: Sale - $1,166,055.78 (profit: $366,055.78)\n- 2024-01-19: Sale - $1,150,635.95 (profit: $350,635.95)\n- 2024-01-20: Sale - $659,057.20 (profit: $159,057.20)\n- 2024-01-22: Sale - $1,499,323.77 (profit: $499,323.77)\n- 2024-01-23: Sale - $710,732.40 (profit: $210,732.40)\n- 2024-01-25: Sale - $2,008,346.63 (profit: $508,346.63)\n- 2024-01-28: Sale - $2,099,974.04 (profit: $599,974.04)\n- 2024-01-30: Sale - $1,384,532.44 (profit: $384,532.44)\n- 2024-02-02: Sale - $2,063,873.27 (profit: $563,873.27)\n- 2024-02-04: Sale - $2,002,579.13 (profit: $502,579.13)\n- 2024-02-05: Sale - $1,428,329.11 (profit: $428,329.11)\n\nThe sum of all sales is $22,876,677.56, and the total gross profit is $6,476,677.56.\n\n## Step 2: Identify all expenses\nNow I'll sum up all expense transactions:\n\n### Administrative Expenses:\n- 2024-01-01: $27,665.22\n- 2024-01-02: $78,979.22\n- 2024-01-04: $96,158.64\n- 2024-01-05: $58,160.20\n- 2024-01-11: $93,771.10 + $84,202.53 = $177,973.63\n- 2024-01-13: $45,256.88\n- 2024-01-16: $16,712.52\n- 2024-01-17: $76,658.64\n- 2024-01-20: $96,278.36\n- 2024-01-21: $50,605.14 + $89,152.38 = $139,757.52\n- 2024-01-24: $28,942.11\n- 2024-01-25: $54,062.11\n- 2024-01-27: $48,958.22\n- 2024-01-28: $40,022.82\n- 2024-01-29: $64,541.96\n- 2024-02-03: $18,035.41\n- 2024-02-05: $14,646.48 + $98,343.86 = $112,990.34\n\nTotal Administrative Expenses: $1,066,264.79\n\n### Sales Expenses:\n- 2024-01-02: $93,842.80\n- 2024-01-03: $72,054.07\n- 2024-01-05: $12,403.65\n- 2024-01-06: $55,244.67\n- 2024-01-07: $90,710.35\n- 2024-01-08: $38,143.60\n- 2024-01-09: $15,569.62 + $82,068.28 = $97,637.90\n- 2024-01-12: $86,165.15\n- 2024-01-14: $49,553.54\n- 2024-01-15: $77,935.63\n- 2024-01-16: $46,003.89\n- 2024-01-18: $73,389.05\n- 2024-01-19: $21,035.98\n- 2024-01-22: $66,953.91\n- 2024-01-26: $66,053.33\n- 2024-01-27: $25,010.75\n- 2024-01-28: $66,279.02\n- 2024-01-30: $99,857.40\n- 2024-01-31: $99,981.12\n- 2024-02-01: $57,315.43\n- 2024-02-02: $69,500.88 + $56,421.46 = $125,922.34\n- 2024-02-04: $39,992.76\n\nTotal Sales Expenses: $1,465,481.34\n\n### Financial Expenses:\n- 2024-01-01: $85,147.37\n- 2024-01-06: $80,927.47\n- 2024-01-13: $86,582.27\n- 2024-01-17: $12,485.39\n- 2024-01-18: $23,920.73\n- 2024-01-19: $82,862.75\n- 2024-01-23: $76,771.42\n- 2024-01-25: $92,558.72\n- 2024-01-29: $42,174.02\n- 2024-02-03: $49,152.30\n\nTotal Financial Expenses: $632,582.44\n\n### Depreciation Expenses:\n- 2024-01-01: $45,747.00\n- 2024-02-01: $74,884.67\n\nTotal Depreciation Expenses: $120,631.67\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Interest Income\nLet's sum up all interest receivables:\n\nTotal interest income: $10,758.92 (Sum of all \"Interest Receivables\" transactions)\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Net Profit\nNow I'll calculate the net profit using the formula:\nNet Profit = Gross Profit + Interest Income - (Administrative Expenses + Sales Expenses + Financial Expenses + Depreciation)\n\nNet Profit = $6,476,677.56 + $10,758.92 - ($1,066,264.79 + $1,465,481.34 + $632,582.44 + $120,631.67)\nNet Profit = $6,487,436.48 - $3,284,960.24\nNet Profit = $3,202,476.24\n\nHowever, I need to verify this by recalculating using a different approach to ensure accuracy.\n\nUpon closer review, I noticed I need to subtract the cost of goods sold from sales revenue, not just use the profit amounts. But since the profit amounts are already calculated in the data as revenue minus cost, I'll use these values directly.\n\nTherefore, the final net profit is $3,202,476.24.\n\nLet me round to two decimal places:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '3202476.24'} }\n```",
