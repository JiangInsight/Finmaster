                        "content": "I need to calculate the final net increase in cash and cash equivalents from the transactions in the cash flow statement. Let me analyze the data systematically.\n\nFirst, I'll identify all cash and bank transactions that affect cash and cash equivalents:\n\n1. Initial cash and bank balances:\n   - Initial Cash deposit: 5,000,000.00\n   - Initial Bank deposit: 15,000,000.00\n   - Total initial balance: 20,000,000.00\n\n2. Cash outflows:\n   - Purchases paid in cash: 1,600,000.00\n   - Purchases paid by bank transfer: 13,300,000.00 (2,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 800,000 + 500,000 + 2,000,000 + 3,000,000)\n   - Fixed assets purchases (bank): 2,729,032.26 (1,219,968.64 + 1,509,063.62)\n   - Expenses paid in cash: 2,771,701.91 (sum of all administrative, sales, and financial expenses)\n\n3. Cash inflows:\n   - Sales received in cash: 7,429,967.49 (651,423.21 + 659,057.20 + 710,732.40 + 2,008,346.63 + 2,099,974.04 + 1,384,532.44)\n   \n4. Transfers between cash and bank:\n   - Cash to bank transfers: 7,000,000.00\n   - Bank to cash transfers: 5,000,000.00\n   - Net transfers: -2,000,000.00 (negative means net transfer from cash to bank)\n\nNow let's calculate the final balance:\n\nStarting balance: 20,000,000.00\nCash outflows: -17,671,701.91 (-1,600,000.00 - 13,300,000.00 - 2,729,032.26 - 2,771,701.91)\nCash inflows: +7,429,967.49\nNet transfers: 0 (these just move money between cash and bank accounts)\n\nNet change: -10,241,734.42 (7,429,967.49 - 17,671,701.91)\n\nFinal net increase in cash and cash equivalents: -10,241,734.42\n\nLet me double-check this calculation:\n- Initial cash + bank: 20,000,000.00\n- Final cash + bank (after all transactions): 9,758,265.58 (20,000,000.00 - 10,241,734.42)\n- Net increase: -10,241,734.42\n\nTherefore, the final net increase (which is actually a decrease) in cash and cash equivalents is -10,241,734.42.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Increase': '-10241734.42'} }\n```",
