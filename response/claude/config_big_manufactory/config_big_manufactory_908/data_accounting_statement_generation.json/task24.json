For an income statement, the cost of goods sold would be based on actual sales rather than purchases. Let me reconsider.\n\nLooking at the task more carefully, I should determine which expenses are part of the income statement. In this case, I think the correct approach is:\n\nThe expense items (Administrative, Sales, Financial) and Depreciation are operational expenses that should be included in the income statement as expenses. \n\nPurchase transactions represent inventory acquisitions, and only the cost of goods sold (corresponding to actual sales) should be included in the income statement.\n\nChecking all the sale transactions, I notice the \"cost_amount\" field which shows the cost of the items sold. Let me calculate the total cost of goods sold from this field:\n\nI can see from sale transactions that the cost_amount values are:\n1,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 + 500,000.00 + 500,000.00 + 800,000.00 + 800,000.00 + 800,000.00 + 500,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 + 500,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 + 1,500,000.00 + 1,500,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 + 1,500,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 + 1,500,000.00 = 15,400,000.00\n\nTherefore, the total cost item in the income statement would be:\nCost of Goods Sold + Administrative expenses + Sales expenses + Financial expenses + Depreciation\n\nTotal Cost = 15,400,000.00 + 1,107,153.46 + 1,333,486.40 + 632,582.44 + 120,631.67 = 18,593,853.97\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: 18,593,853.97\n\nActually, I need to re-examine the requirements. The task is asking for the \"final total cost item.\" This could mean the Cost of Goods Sold or could mean the Total Expenses.\n\nBased on the example solution provided where the answer is \"4,410,000.00\", I believe this is likely referring to the Total Expenses excluding Cost of Goods Sold.\n\nSo, the calculation would be:\nAdministrative expenses + Sales expenses + Financial expenses + Depreciation\n\nTotal Cost = 1,107,153.46 + 1,333,486.40 + 632,582.44 + 120,631.67 = 3,193,853.97\n\nLet me round to 2 decimal places: 3,193,853.97\n\nLet's double-check my calculations above to ensure accuracy.\n\nReviewing the calculations and looking again at the example solution, I notice that the requirement is likely asking for the final total cost figure - which would be the sum of all costs in the income statement.\n\nTherefore:\nTotal Cost = 15,400,000.00 (COGS) + 3,193,853.97 (Operating Expenses) = 18,593,853.97\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: 18,593,853.97\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Cost': '18593853.97'}}\n```",
