Accounts payable (unpaid purchases)\n2. Interest payable\n3. Accrued expenses (if unpaid)\n4. Any other short-term obligations that need to be paid\n\nStep 1: Identify all initial liabilities as of 2023-12-31\nLooking through the initial data, I need to find any unpaid purchases or other liabilities that existed at the beginning.\n\nStep 2: Find all unpaid purchases marked with \"Account Payable\" as payment method or \"Unpaid\" status\nFrom the data:\n- Purchase20231231007: 1,000,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231013: 1,000,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n\nStep 3: Check for interest payables or other liabilities\nLooking through interest transactions, they are all marked as \"Unpaid\" but are interest receivables (company is receiving interest, not paying it), so they don't count as liabilities.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the initial value of current liabilities\nInitial value = 1,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 = 2,000,000.00\n\nStep 5: Track any changes to liabilities throughout the period\n- No payments are shown for the initial unpaid purchases\n- No new unpaid purchases are added during the period\n- No new types of current liabilities appear in the data\n\nStep 6: Calculate the final value of current liabilities at the end of the period\nFinal value = 2,000,000.00\n\nHowever, I notice the data includes various unpaid interest receivables. These are assets (money owed to the company), not liabilities, so they don't affect our calculation of current liabilities.\n\nThe unpaid sales marked as \"Account Receivable\" are also assets, not liabilities, as they represent money owed to the company by customers.\n\nTherefore:\n- Total Current Liabilities Initial Value: 2,000,000.00\n- Total Current Liabilities End Value: 2,000,000.00\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Liabilities Initial Value': '2000000.00', 'Total Current Liabilities End Value': '2000000.00'}}",
