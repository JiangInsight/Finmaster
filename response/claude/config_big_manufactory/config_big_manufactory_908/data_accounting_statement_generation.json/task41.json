This requires tracking all transactions related to accounts payable to determine the net change during the period.\n\nFirst, I'll identify all purchases that were made on account payable and check which ones remain unpaid at the end of the period.\n\nLet me go through the data:\n\n1. Looking for transactions with \"Account Payable\" as payment method:\n   - Purchase20231231007: Purchase of Heavy Equipment C for 1,000,000.00, Payment status: Unpaid\n   - Purchase20231231013: Purchase of Heavy Equipment A for 1,000,000.00, Payment status: Unpaid\n\n2. The accounts payable balance consists of the sum of these unpaid purchases:\n   - Purchase20231231007: 1,000,000.00\n   - Purchase20231231013: 1,000,000.00\n   - Total: 2,000,000.00\n\nSince the accounts payable transactions represent an increase in the liability (the company owes this money), this would be shown as an increase in accounts payable of 2,000,000.00 in the cash flow statement.\n\nHowever, to properly calculate the \"Increase (Decrease)\" in accounts payable for the cash flow statement, I need to compare the ending balance to the beginning balance.\n\nThe data doesn't explicitly show the beginning balance of accounts payable, but I can determine it was zero since these are the only accounts payable transactions in the dataset and they were all created on 2023-12-31 (the beginning of the period).\n\nTherefore, the increase in accounts payable is 2,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '2000000.00'} }\n```",
