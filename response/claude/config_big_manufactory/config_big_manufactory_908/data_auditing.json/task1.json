The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n- This is clearly a category mismatch where the transaction was incorrectly recorded as a \"Sale\" rather than \"Interest Receivables\"\n\nThis is the most obvious inconsistency in the data. The transaction is clearly meant to be an Interest Receivables entry based on both its ID and invoice description, but was incorrectly categorized as a Sale in the recorded_type field.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Interest Receivables', 'Recorded category': 'Sale', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Interest20240113013'} }\n```",
