For transaction \"Sale20240117018\":\n   - The recorded_type is \"Financial Expenses\" but the invoice describes it as a \"Sale\"\n   - The recorded_amount is $1,193,828.76 but the invoice indicates $1,124,652.91 based on the unit price\n   - The transaction details in the invoice show it's clearly a sale (with unit price, tax, cost amount, profit, etc.)\n   - This appears to be both misclassified as an expense and has an incorrect amount\n\nThis is a clear inconsistency where a sale transaction was incorrectly categorized as an expense, and the amount was also incorrectly recorded.\n\nLet me check if there are any other inconsistencies:\n\nLooking through the rest of the data, I don't see any other obvious inconsistencies where the invoice description contradicts the recorded fields or where calculations don't align.\n\nThe transaction \"Sale20240117018\" stands out because:\n1. Its type doesn't match what's in the invoice description\n2. The amount doesn't match what's calculated in the invoice\n3. The invoice clearly describes sale details (quantity, unit price, tax, profit)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Financial Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '1124652.91', 'Recorded amount': '1193828.76', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240117018'} }\n```",
