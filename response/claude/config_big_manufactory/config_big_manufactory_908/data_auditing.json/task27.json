The `recorded_type` is \"Depreciation\" but the invoice clearly states it's a \"Sale\"\n2. The `recorded_price` is 1351250.7, but the invoice states a unit price of $1460946.33\n3. The `recorded_amount` is 1633150.89, but the invoice states a total of $1460946.33\n\nThe discrepancies are significant:\n- Category mismatch (Sale vs Depreciation)\n- Price difference of $109,695.63 per unit\n- Total amount difference of $172,204.56\n\nSince the invoice is considered more reliable, and it consistently describes this as a sales transaction with corresponding details about cost amount, tax amount, etc., I believe this is indeed a Sales transaction that was incorrectly recorded.\n\nThe profit in the invoice ($460,946.33) makes sense with the other fields (sale price of $1,460,946.33 minus cost of $1,000,000.00).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Depreciation\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"1460946.33\", \"Recorded price\": \"1351250.7\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"1460946.33\", \"Recorded amount\": \"1633150.89\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240108007\"}}\n```",
