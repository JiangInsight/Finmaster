The recorded_type is \"Purchase\" but the transaction ID starts with \"Sale\" and the invoice description clearly states it's a Sale transaction.\n\n2. The recorded_tax_amount is $1,258,161.28, which is extremely high compared to the transaction amount of $1,124,652.91. The invoice description states the tax amount should be $56,232.65.\n\n3. The math in the invoice also confirms this - the total amount due ($1,068,420.26) is derived from the transaction amount ($1,124,652.91) minus the tax amount ($56,232.65), which is consistent with normal tax calculations.\n\nThis transaction has two clear errors: an incorrect transaction type (recorded as Purchase instead of Sale) and a grossly inflated tax amount (recorded as $1,258,161.28 instead of $56,232.65).\n\nChecking other transactions, I don't see other inconsistencies of this magnitude. The fields in the other transactions appear to be consistent with their invoice descriptions.\n\nTherefore, my solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Purchase\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": \"56232.65\", \"Recorded tax\": \"1258161.28\", \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240117018\"}}\n```",
