The recorded_amount is 0.0, but the invoice states \"totaling $710732.40\"\n2. The recorded_quantity is 0.0, but the invoice states \"consisting of 1.0 units\"\n3. The recorded_tax_amount is 561976.05, but the invoice states \"tax amount of $35536.62\"\n4. The recorded_unit_price is 769880.83, but the invoice states \"unit price of $710732.40\"\n\nThese values in the recorded data don't match what's in the invoice description, which is considered more reliable as invoices are standardized financial documents.\n\nLet me prepare the solution with the correct values based on the invoice:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '1.0', 'Recorded quantity': '0.0', 'Original price': '710732.40', 'Recorded price': '769880.83', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '710732.40', 'Recorded amount': '0.0', 'Original tax': '35536.62', 'Recorded tax': '561976.05', 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240123026'} }\n```",
