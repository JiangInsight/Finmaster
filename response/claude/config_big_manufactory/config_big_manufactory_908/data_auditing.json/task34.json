I'll focus on the transaction that appears to have internal inconsistencies by comparing the recorded information with the invoice details.\n\nLooking at the transactions, I found one with significant discrepancies. Let me analyze it step by step:\n\nTransaction ID: Sale20240109009\n\nThe recorded information shows:\n- recorded_type: \"Administrative Expenses\"\n- recorded_date: \"2024-01-14\"\n- recorded_quantity: 0.0\n- recorded_unit_price: 1612315.03\n- recorded_tax_amount: 1205714.62\n- recorded_profit: 489365.79\n\nHowever, examining the invoice description:\n\"On January 09, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $1489365.79, totaling $1489365.79. The cost amount for this transaction was $1000000.00, with a tax amount of $74468.29, leading to a total amount due of $1414897.50. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nThis reveals multiple discrepancies:\n1. Transaction type: Invoice says \"Sale\" but recorded as \"Administrative Expenses\"\n2. Date: Invoice says \"January 09, 2024\" but recorded as \"2024-01-14\"\n3. Quantity: Invoice states \"1.0 units\" but recorded as \"0.0\"\n4. Unit price: Invoice states \"$1489365.79\" but recorded as \"1612315.03\"\n5. Tax amount: Invoice states \"$74468.29\" but recorded as \"1205714.62\"\n\nThe invoice is likely the reliable source since it contains detailed information that follows a standard format and would have been generated at the time of the transaction.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-09\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-14\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"0.0\", \"Original price\": \"1489365.79\", \"Recorded price\": \"1612315.03\", \"Original receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\", \"Original amount\": \"1489365.79\", \"Recorded amount\": \"0.0\", \"Original tax\": \"74468.29\", \"Recorded tax\": \"1205714.62\", \"Original profit\": \"489365.79\", \"Recorded profit\": \"489365.79\", \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240109009\"}}\n```",
