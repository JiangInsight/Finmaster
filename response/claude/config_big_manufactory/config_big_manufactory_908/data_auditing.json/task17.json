I'll pay special attention to the invoice field since it's noted as more reliable.\n\nLet me examine the transaction entries carefully:\n\nLooking at transaction ID \"Interest20240123023\", I notice that the recorded_type is \"Depreciation\" but the invoice description says it's for \"Interest Receivables\". This is an inconsistency.\n\nAlso, the recorded_receive_method is \"Interest receivable\" but in all other similar interest transactions, the receive_method is consistently \"Interest receviable\" (with the \"vi\" order).\n\nLet me verify this against the invoice field:\nThe invoice states: \"On January 23, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Interest Receivables, totaling $77.52. The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nThis confirms both inconsistencies:\n1. The transaction type should be \"Interest Receivables\" not \"Depreciation\"\n2. The receive_method should be \"Interest receviable\" not \"Interest receivable\"\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Interest Receivables', 'Recorded category': 'Depreciation', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': 'Interest receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Interest receivable', 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Interest20240123023'} }\n```",
