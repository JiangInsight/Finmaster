The recorded amount is 0.0, but the invoice describes a sale totaling $710,732.40\n2. Recorded quantity is 0.0, but the invoice mentions 1.0 unit\n3. The recorded payment/receipt_status is \"Unpaid\" but the invoice states the transaction was \"paid\"\n4. The profit calculation appears incorrect:\n   - From invoice: $500,000 cost, $710,732.40 revenue â†’ profit should be $210,732.40\n   - Recorded profit is $253,946.08\n\nThese inconsistencies suggest data entry errors in multiple fields for this transaction.\n\n## Sale20240103002 through Sale20240205041\nI've checked the other transactions and don't see similar obvious errors in their recordings compared to their invoice descriptions.\n\nThe most reliable inconsistency I found is in Sale20240123026, where the quantities, amounts, payment status, and profit calculations don't align with the invoice description.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"0.0\", \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"710732.40\", \"Recorded amount\": \"0.0\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": \"210732.40\", \"Recorded profit\": \"253946.08\", \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240123026\"}}\n```",
