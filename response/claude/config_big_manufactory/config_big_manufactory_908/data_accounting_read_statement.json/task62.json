Financing costs incurred for operations (financial expenses)\n3. Cash payments to acquire long-term assets (purchase of fixed assets)\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement to find these items:\n\n### Balance Sheet\n- For accounts receivable, I find \"Accounts Receivable\" with an end amount of 15362611.64\n\n### Income Statement\n- For financing costs, I see \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of 632582.44\n\n### Cash Flow Statement\n- For cash payments to acquire long-term assets, I find \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an amount of 2729032.26\n\nTherefore, the three values I need to extract are:\n- value1 (accounts receivable): 15362611.64\n- value2 (financial expenses): 632582.44\n- value3 (purchase of fixed assets): 2729032.26\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '15362611.64', 'value2': '632582.44', 'value3': '2729032.26'}}\n```",
