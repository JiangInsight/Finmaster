This is the liability account that shows how much tax the company owes but hasn't paid yet.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial value of Taxes Payable (as of 2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End value of Taxes Payable (as of 2024-02-05): 1143833.89\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1143833.89'}}\n```",
