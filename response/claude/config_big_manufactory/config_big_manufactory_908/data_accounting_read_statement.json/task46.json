Under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\":\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 2,729,032.26\n   - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -2,729,032.26\n\nThe negative value (-2,729,032.26) represents cash outflow for investing activities. This is the net amount we're looking for.\n\nThe sub-item component is:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 2,729,032.26 (positive value as it's the component amount before considering it as an outflow)\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-2729032.26\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value\": \"2729032.26\"}}}\n```",
