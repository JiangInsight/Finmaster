First, I'll examine the balance sheet, which shows assets, liabilities, and equity.\n   - I can see an account called \"Interest Receivable\" which represents interest that has been earned but not yet received.\n   - The initial amount is listed as 0.00 as of 2023-12-31\n   - The end amount is listed as 13240.11 as of 2024-02-05\n\n2. I can also verify this in the cash flow statement:\n   - There's a line \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" with an amount of -13240.11\n   - The negative sign indicates an increase in the interest receivable\n\n3. Additionally, in the income statement:\n   - \"Interest Income\" is shown as 13240.11, which matches the end value of Interest Receivable\n\nBased on this analysis, the interest accrued but not yet received had an initial value of 0.00 and an end value of 13240.11.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '13240.11'} }\n```",
