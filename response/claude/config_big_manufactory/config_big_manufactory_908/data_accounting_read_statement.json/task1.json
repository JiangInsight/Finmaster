In this case:\n- Initial amount (2023-12-31): 5,000,000.00\n- End amount (2024-02-05): 627,601.28\n\nWhile \"Bank Deposits\" might also be considered cash, I'll focus on \"Cash on Hand\" as it represents the most liquid form of cash directly available for operations. This is consistent with the approach in the example solution provided.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '627601.28'}}\n```",
