This represents interest that has accrued but hasn't been received yet.\n\nStep 2: Find the net addition in cash and cash equivalents.\nLooking at the cash flow statement, I can see the line item \"Net Increase\" with a value of -19501430.98. This represents the net change (in this case, a decrease) in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\nStep 3: Extract the values and format the response.\nThe two values I need are:\n- Interest accrued but not yet received: 13240.11\n- Net addition in cash and cash equivalents: -19501430.98\n\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13240.11', 'value2': '-19501430.98'}}",
