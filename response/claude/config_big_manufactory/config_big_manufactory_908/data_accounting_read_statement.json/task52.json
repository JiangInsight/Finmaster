This is typically shown as \"Paid-in Capital,\" \"Share Capital,\" or a similar account.\n\nFrom the balance sheet, I can see:\n- Paid-in Capital: 28,000,000.00 (Initial amount on 2023-12-31)\n- Paid-in Capital: 28,000,000.00 (End amount on 2024-02-05)\n\nThis represents the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares of the company, and it has remained unchanged during the reporting period.\n\nTherefore, the initial value and end value of capital contributed by shareholders are both 28,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '28000000.00', 'end value': '28000000.00'}}\n```",
