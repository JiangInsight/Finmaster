The profit before tax is clearly stated as 3082821.36 on 2024-02-05.\n\nTo identify the sub-items, I need to understand how profit before tax is calculated:\n- It generally starts with revenue\n- Subtracts costs and expenses\n- Adds any other income like interest income\n\nLooking at the statement, I can decompose it as follows:\n1. Total Revenue: 22876677.56\n2. Total Cost: 16400000.00\n3. Total Expenses: 3407096.31\n4. Interest Income: 13240.11\n\nThe calculation would be: \nTotal Revenue - Total Cost - Total Expenses + Interest Income = Profit Before Tax\n22876677.56 - 16400000.00 - 3407096.31 + 13240.11 = 3082821.36\n\nThis confirms these are the correct components.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3082821.36', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '22876677.56', 'sub_item value2': '16400000.00', 'sub_item value3': '3407096.31', 'sub_item value4': '13240.11'}}}\n```",
