This is exactly what we're looking for.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- The initial amount for \"Interest Receivable\" as of 2023-12-31 is 0.00\n- The end amount for \"Interest Receivable\" as of 2024-02-05 is 13240.11\n\nTherefore, the accrued interest that has not yet been received started at 0.00 and ended at 13240.11.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '13240.11'}}\n```",
