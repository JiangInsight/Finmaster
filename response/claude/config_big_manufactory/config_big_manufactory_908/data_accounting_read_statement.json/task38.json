However, the task is asking for a decrease in amounts owed, which would be the opposite. Since the accounts receivable increased by 15,362,611.64, there is not actually a decrease to report.\n\nHowever, based on the example provided, it appears the task is asking for the value associated with the Accounts Receivable line, even if it represents an increase rather than a decrease.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-15362611.64'}}\n```",
