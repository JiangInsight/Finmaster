The key line item representing amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit is typically \"Accounts Payable\"\n\n2. In the balance sheet, I can find:\n   - Accounts Payable: Initial amount = 0.00 (on 2023-12-31)\n   - Accounts Payable: End amount = 2000000.00 (on 2024-02-05)\n\n3. This represents the money the company owes to its suppliers for goods and services purchased on credit.\n\nTherefore, the values I need to extract are:\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- End value: 2000000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '2000000.00'}}\n```",
