Addition in amount owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- \"Paid-in Capital\" represents capital contributed by shareholders: 28000000.00\n- \"Accounts Payable\" represents amount owed for goods/services on credit: 2000000.00\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- \"Profit Before Tax\" represents profit before deducting tax expense: 3082821.36\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" confirms the addition in accounts payable: 2000000.00\n- \"Net Profit\" matches the income statement's final figure\n\nExtracting the three required values:\n1. Paid-in Capital: 28000000.00\n2. Profit Before Tax: 3082821.36\n3. Accounts Payable (end amount): 2000000.00\n\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28000000.00', 'value2': '3082821.36', 'value3': '2000000.00'}}",
