This information would typically be found in the income statement as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" or similar terminology.\n\nFrom the income statement section, I can see:\n```\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 16400000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\n\nThis line item represents the carrying amount of inventories that were sold during the reporting period. The Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is the direct cost attributable to the production of goods sold by a company, which includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the goods.\n\nTherefore, the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is 16,400,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '16400000.00'} }\n```",
