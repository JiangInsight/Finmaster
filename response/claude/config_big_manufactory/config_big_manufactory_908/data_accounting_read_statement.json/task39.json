This means there was not a reduction but rather an increase in inventory.\n\nHowever, the task specifically asks for the value of reduction in assets held for sale. In a cash flow statement, a negative number in the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" line means inventory increased (which is a use of cash), while a positive number would indicate a reduction in inventory (which is a source of cash).\n\nSince the number is negative (-6600000.00), it represents an increase in inventory, not a reduction. Nevertheless, this is the line item that refers to changes in assets held for sale (inventory), so I should report this value.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-6600000.00'}}\n```",
