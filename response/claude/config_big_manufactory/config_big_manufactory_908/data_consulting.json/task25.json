                        "content": "I'll calculate the three required financial ratios step by step.\n\n1. First, let's calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio:\n   - Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n   - Total Liabilities = $3,143,833.89 (from balance sheet)\n   - Total Owner's Equity = $29,938,987.47 (from balance sheet)\n   - Debt to Equity Ratio = $3,143,833.89 / $29,938,987.47 = 0.105 ≈ 0.11\n\n2. Next, let's calculate the Net Profit Margin:\n   - Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\n   - Net Profit = $1,938,987.47 (from income statement)\n   - Total Revenue = $22,876,677.56 (from income statement)\n   - Net Profit Margin = ($1,938,987.47 / $22,876,677.56) × 100% = 8.48%\n\n3. Finally, let's calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio:\n   - Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$16,772,398.72 (from cash flow statement)\n   - Total Current Liabilities = $3,143,833.89 (from balance sheet)\n   - Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -$16,772,398.72 / $3,143,833.89 = -5.33\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\", \"Net Profit Margin\": \"8.48%\", \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-5.33\"}}\n```",
