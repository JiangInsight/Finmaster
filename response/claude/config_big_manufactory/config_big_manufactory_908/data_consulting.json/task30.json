                        "content": "I'll calculate the key financial ratios based on the given financial statements, step by step.\n\n## 1. Current Ratio\nThe Current Ratio is calculated as: Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities\n- Current Assets = $22,474,420.77\n- Current Liabilities = $3,143,833.89\n- Current Ratio = $22,474,420.77 ÷ $3,143,833.89 = 7.15\n\n## 2. Quick Ratio\nThe Quick Ratio is calculated as: (Current Assets - Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities\n- Current Assets = $22,474,420.77\n- Inventory = $6,600,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = $3,143,833.89\n- Quick Ratio = ($22,474,420.77 - $6,600,000.00) ÷ $3,143,833.89 = $15,874,420.77 ÷ $3,143,833.89 = 5.05\n\n## 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated as: Total Liabilities ÷ Total Assets\n- Total Liabilities = $3,143,833.89\n- Total Assets = $33,082,821.36\n- Debt to Asset Ratio = $3,143,833.89 ÷ $33,082,821.36 = 0.095 ≈ 0.10\n\n## 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio is calculated as: Total Liabilities ÷ Total Owner's Equity\n- Total Liabilities = $3,143,833.89\n- Total Owner's Equity = $29,938,987.47\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = $3,143,833.89 ÷ $29,938,987.47 = 0.105 ≈ 0.11\n\n## 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nThe Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is calculated as: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities ÷ Total Liabilities\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$16,772,398.72\n- Total Liabilities = $3,143,833.89\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -$16,772,398.72 ÷ $3,143,833.89 = -5.33\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '7.15', 'Quick Ratio': '5.05', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-5.33'}}\n```",
