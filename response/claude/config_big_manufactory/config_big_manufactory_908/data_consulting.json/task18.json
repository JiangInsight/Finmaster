                        "content": "I need to calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio, which is the ratio of a company's net operating cash flow to its current liabilities.\n\nFirst, let me identify the key values:\n\n1. Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -16,772,398.72 (from the cash flow statement)\n2. Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89 (from the balance sheet)\n\nThe Operating Cash Flow Ratio formula is:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nCalculating:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 = -5.3351\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -5.34\n\nThis negative ratio indicates that the company's operations are not generating enough cash to cover its short-term liabilities. In fact, operations are consuming cash rather than generating it.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-5.34'}}\n```",
