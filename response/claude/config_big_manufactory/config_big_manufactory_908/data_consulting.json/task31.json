Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\nFormula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nSince we only have the ending accounts receivable (not beginning), I'll use the ending value:\n- Net Credit Sales = Main Business Revenue = $22,876,677.56\n- Accounts Receivable (ending) = $15,362,611.64\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $22,876,677.56 / $15,362,611.64 = 1.49\n\n## 2. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with its operating cash flow.\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\n- Operating Cash Flow = -$16,772,398.72\n- Current Liabilities = $3,143,833.89\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -$16,772,398.72 / $3,143,833.89 = -5.33\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio, so:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -5.33\n\n## 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\nFormula: Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\n- Net Sales = $22,876,677.56\n- Average Total Assets = (Initial Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2\n- Average Total Assets = ($28,000,000.00 + $33,082,821.36) / 2 = $30,541,410.68\n\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = $22,876,677.56 / $30,541,410.68 = 0.75\n\n## 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures a company's financial leverage.\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities = $3,143,833.89\n- Total Equity = $29,938,987.47\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $3,143,833.89 / $29,938,987.47 = 0.10\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '1.49', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-5.33', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-5.33', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.75', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.10'} }\n```",
