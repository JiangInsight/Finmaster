The Debt to Asset Ratio measures what portion of a company's assets is financed by debt.\n\nThe formula for Debt to Asset Ratio is:\nTotal Liabilities รท Total Assets\n\nStep 1: Identify the Total Liabilities from the balance sheet.\nFrom the balance sheet, I can see that:\n- Total Current Liabilities: $3,143,833.89\n- There are no long-term liabilities mentioned\n- Therefore, Total Liabilities = $3,143,833.89\n\nStep 2: Identify the Total Assets from the balance sheet.\n- Total Assets: $33,082,821.36\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio.\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities รท Total Assets\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $3,143,833.89 รท $33,082,821.36\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 0.0950\n\nStep 4: Round to two decimal places.\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 0.10 or 10%\n\nTherefore, the Debt to Asset Ratio is 0.10.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10'}}\n```",
