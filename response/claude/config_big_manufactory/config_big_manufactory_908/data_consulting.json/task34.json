                        "content": "I'll solve this problem by calculating each financial ratio step by step.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis measures the ability to cover current liabilities with operating cash flows.\n- Operating Cash Flow = -16,772,398.72\n- Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n- Ratio = -16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 = -5.33\n\n## 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures the proportion of debt relative to equity.\n- Total Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n- Total Equity = 29,938,987.47\n- Ratio = 3,143,833.89 / 29,938,987.47 = 0.11\n\n## 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n- Revenue = 22,876,677.56\n- Average Total Assets = (28,000,000.00 + 33,082,821.36) / 2 = 30,541,410.68\n- Ratio = 22,876,677.56 / 30,541,410.68 = 0.75\n\n## 4. Quick Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n- Quick Assets = Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable\n- Quick Assets = 627,601.28 + (-129,032.26) + 13,240.11 + 15,362,611.64 = 15,874,420.77\n- Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n- Ratio = 15,874,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 = 5.05\n\n## 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis is the same as Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -5.33\n\n## 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\nThis measures the profitability relative to shareholders' equity.\n- Net Profit = 1,938,987.47\n- Average Equity = (28,000,000.00 + 29,938,987.47) / 2 = 28,969,493.74\n- ROE = (1,938,987.47 / 28,969,493.74) Ã— 100% = 6.69%\n\n## 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company collects revenue from credit sales.\n- Revenue = 22,876,677.56\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 15,362,611.64) / 2 = 7,681,305.82\n- Ratio = 22,876,677.56 / 7,681,305.82 = 2.98\n\nNow I'll compile these results:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-5.33\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\", \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.75\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"5.05\", \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-5.33\", \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"6.69%\", \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.98\"}}\n```",
