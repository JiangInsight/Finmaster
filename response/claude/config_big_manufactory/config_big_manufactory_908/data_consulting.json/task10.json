First, I need to identify the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities from the cash flow statement:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -16,772,398.72\n\n2. Next, I need to identify the Total Current Liabilities from the balance sheet:\n   - Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n\n3. Now I can calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio:\n   - Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities รท Total Current Liabilities\n   - Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -16,772,398.72 รท 3,143,833.89\n   - Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -5.335\n\n4. Rounding to two decimal places:\n   - Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -5.34\n\nTherefore, the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio is -5.34.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-5.34'}}\n```",
