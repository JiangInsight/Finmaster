Net Cash Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with its cash and cash equivalents.\n\nFormula: Net Cash Ratio = (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / (Current Liabilities)\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand: $627,601.28\n- Bank Deposits: -$129,032.26\n- Total Cash and Cash Equivalents: $498,569.02\n- Total Current Liabilities: $3,143,833.89\n\nNet Cash Ratio = $498,569.02 / $3,143,833.89 = 0.16\n\n## 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company is using its current assets to generate revenue.\n\nFormula: Current Assets Turnover Ratio = Sales (Revenue) / Average Current Assets\n\nFrom the financial statements:\n- Total Revenue: $22,876,677.56\n- Initial Current Assets: $20,000,000.00\n- Ending Current Assets: $22,474,420.77\n- Average Current Assets: ($20,000,000.00 + $22,474,420.77) / 2 = $21,237,210.39\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = $22,876,677.56 / $21,237,210.39 = 1.08\n\n## 3. Quick Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n\nFormula: Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets: $22,474,420.77\n- Inventory: $6,600,000.00\n- Current Liabilities: $3,143,833.89\n\nQuick Ratio = ($22,474,420.77 - $6,600,000.00) / $3,143,833.89 = $15,874,420.77 / $3,143,833.89 = 5.05\n\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Ratio': '0.16', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '1.08', 'Quick Ratio': '5.05'}}",
