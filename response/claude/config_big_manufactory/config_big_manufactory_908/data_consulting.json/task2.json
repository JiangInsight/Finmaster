The Quick Ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n\nThe Quick Ratio formula is:\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) รท Current Liabilities\n\nStep 1: Identify the Current Assets at the end of the reporting period.\nCurrent Assets = $22,474,420.77\n\nStep 2: Subtract Inventory from Current Assets.\nCurrent Assets - Inventory = $22,474,420.77 - $6,600,000.00 = $15,874,420.77\n\nStep 3: Identify the Current Liabilities at the end of the reporting period.\nCurrent Liabilities = $3,143,833.89\n\nStep 4: Calculate the Quick Ratio.\nQuick Ratio = $15,874,420.77 รท $3,143,833.89 = 5.05\n\nStep 5: Round to two decimal places.\nQuick Ratio = 5.05\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '5.05'}}\n```",
