                        "content": "I need to calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio for this business. This ratio measures how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period.\n\nStep 1: Understand the formula for Inventory Turnover Ratio.\nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory\n\nStep 2: Identify the Cost of Goods Sold from the income statement.\nCOGS = $16,400,000.00\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Average Inventory.\n- Beginning Inventory (from initial balance sheet): $0.00\n- Ending Inventory (from end balance sheet): $6,600,000.00\n- Average Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2\n- Average Inventory = ($0.00 + $6,600,000.00) / 2 = $3,300,000.00\n\nStep 4: Calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio.\nInventory Turnover Ratio = $16,400,000.00 / $3,300,000.00 = 4.97\n\nTherefore, the Inventory Turnover Ratio is 4.97, which means the company sold and replaced its inventory approximately 4.97 times during the period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '4.97'} }\n```",
