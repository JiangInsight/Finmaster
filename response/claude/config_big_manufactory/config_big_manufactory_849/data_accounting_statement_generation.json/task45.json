                        "content": "I need to calculate the net cash flow from investing activities based on the transactions data. Let me approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, I'll identify all transactions related to investing activities in the data. Cash flows from investing activities typically include:\n1. Purchase of fixed assets\n2. Sale of fixed assets\n3. Purchase of investments\n4. Sale of investments\n\nLet me analyze the transactions and identify those related to investing activities:\n\nLooking through the data, I can see entries with types \"Fixed Assets Purchase\". These are clearly investing activities that represent cash outflows.\n\nFrom the data provided, I found two fixed asset purchase transactions:\n1. FixedAsset20231231001 with amount 886,161.25 (Heavy Machinery)\n2. FixedAsset20231231001 with amount 839,853.83 (Production Line Equipment)\n\nI don't see any sale of fixed assets or investments that would represent cash inflows for investing activities.\n\nLet me calculate the total amount:\n- Cash outflows for fixed asset purchases: 886,161.25 + 839,853.83 = 1,726,015.08\n\nTherefore, the net cash flow from investing activities is negative (outflow) 1,726,015.08.\n\nHowever, I need to double-check if there are any other investing activities I might have missed. The purchases of Heavy Equipment (P001, P002, P003, P004) are recorded as \"Purchase\" type, which typically indicates inventory purchases - these would be classified under operating activities, not investing activities.\n\nAfter reviewing all transactions, I confirm that only the two fixed asset purchases should be considered for investing activities.\n\nNet Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -1,726,015.08\n\nBut let me round to two decimal places as shown in the example: -1,726,015.08 = -1,726,015.08\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-1726015.08'} }\n```\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculation. I notice that the transactions with type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" have a payment method of \"Bank Transfer\" and relate to acquiring fixed assets:\n\n1. FixedAsset20231231001 - Heavy Machinery - 886,161.25\n2. FixedAsset20231231001 - Production Line Equipment - 839,853.83\n\nThe total is: 886,161.25 + 839,853.83 = 1,726,015.08\n\nSo the Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities is -1,726,015.08.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-1726015.08'}}",
