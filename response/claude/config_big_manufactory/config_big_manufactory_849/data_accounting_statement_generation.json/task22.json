Looking at the transactions, I'll identify all the \"Sale\" types and sum their amounts to calculate the total revenue.\n\nLet me go through all the sales transactions:\n\n1. Sale20240106004: Heavy Equipment A - $748,087.14\n2. Sale20240108006: Heavy Equipment D - $2,146,535.22\n3. Sale20240111008: Heavy Equipment B - $1,151,336.63\n4.

Sale20240204038: Heavy Equipment D - $2,109,215.99\n\nNow I'll sum these amounts:\n$748,087.14 + $2,146,535.22 + $1,151,336.63 + $693,546.26 + $1,348,068.18 + $694,657.72 + $1,076,054.24 + $677,364.56 + $2,210,585.18 + $661,580.66 + $1,492,870.60 + $717,864.25 + $660,969.70 + $2,109,215.99 = $16,388,736.33\n\nLet me double-check my calculation:\n- First 7 sales: $748,087.14 + $2,146,535.22 + $1,151,336.63 + $693,546.26 + $1,348,068.18 + $694,657.72 + $1,076,054.24 = $7,858,285.39\n- Last 7 sales: $677,364.56 + $2,210,585.18 + $661,580.66 + $1,492,870.60 + $717,864.25 + $660,969.70 + $2,109,215.99 = $8,530,450.94\n- Total: $7,858,285.39 + $8,530,450.94 = $16,388,736.33\n\nTherefore, the final total revenue is $16,388,736.33.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Revenue': '16388736.33'}}\n```",
