                        "content": "I need to calculate the final ending cash and cash equivalents balance in the cash flow statement. This requires tracking all cash inflows and outflows in the transactions data.\n\nLet me start by identifying the initial cash balances and then track all cash movements:\n\n1. First, I'll identify initial cash and bank deposits:\n   - Initial Cash deposit: $5,000,000.00\n   - Initial Bank deposit: $15,000,000.00\n   - Total initial cash and equivalents: $20,000,000.00\n\n2. Now I'll track all cash outflows and inflows:\n\nCash Outflows:\n- Purchases paid in cash: $1,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment C)\n- Purchases paid by bank transfer: $1,500,000.00 + $500,000.00 + $1,600,000.00 + $1,000,000.00 + $1,600,000.00 + $500,000.00 + $1,500,000.00 + $500,000.00 + $1,000,000.00 = $9,700,000.00\n- Fixed assets purchases: $886,161.25 + $839,853.83 = $1,726,015.08\n- Expenses paid in cash: $79,714.42 + $51,825.36 + $46,725.01 + $74,702.00 + $78,889.09 + $38,780.99 + $68,900.09 + $87,591.46 + $42,856.74 + $52,268.20 + $19,689.35 + $93,194.55 + $11,813.06 + $86,347.65 + $57,634.90 + $20,862.57 + $53,549.48 + $20,833.95 + $31,910.69 + $46,434.69 + $70,515.58 + $73,168.68 + $96,515.15 + $69,211.25 + $53,607.84 + $14,562.34 + $86,673.60 + $87,474.45 + $83,217.37 + $28,972.80 + $14,855.75 + $39,148.75 + $67,082.31 + $60,508.87 + $33,905.06 + $10,253.90 + $74,109.93 + $42,910.54 + $49,551.38 + $63,370.00 + $45,613.09 + $42,688.86 + $58,370.92 + $12,261.80 + $31,799.89 + $22,552.80 + $83,123.11 + $25,065.28 + $90,539.15 = $2,645,552.49\n\nCash Inflows:\n- Sales received in cash: $748,087.14 + $2,146,535.22 + $1,348,068.18 + $694,657.72 + $677,364.56 + $2,210,585.18 + $661,580.66 + $1,492,870.60 = $9,979,749.26\n\nThe cash flow calculation would be:\nInitial cash and equivalents + Cash inflows - Cash outflows = Ending cash and equivalents\n\n$20,000,000.00 + $9,979,749.26 - ($1,000,000.00 + $9,700,000.00 + $1,726,015.08 + $2,645,552.49) = $15,908,181.69\n\nHowever, I notice there are also cash transfers between cash and bank accounts that need to be accounted for. Let me check these:\n\nI don't see any explicit transfers between cash and bank in this dataset that would affect the total cash and equivalents balance.\n\nLet me review once more to ensure accuracy...\n\nActually, I need to be more careful here. Looking at the data more closely, I can see there are many transactions but need to focus on just those that affect cash balance:\n\n1. Initial balances:\n   - Cash: $5,000,000.00\n   - Bank: $15,000,000.00\n   - Total: $20,000,000.00\n\n2. Cash outflows:\n   - All purchases paid by cash or bank transfer: $12,700,000.00\n   - Fixed assets purchases: $1,726,015.08\n   - All expenses paid in cash: $2,645,552.49\n\n3. Cash inflows:\n   - All sales received in cash: $9,979,749.26\n\nTherefore, the ending cash and cash equivalents balance is:\n$20,000,000.00 + $9,979,749.26 - $12,700,000.00 - $1,726,015.08 - $2,645,552.49 = $12,908,181.69\n\nThis is the final ending cash and cash equivalents balance.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Ending Balance': '12908181.69'} }\n```",
