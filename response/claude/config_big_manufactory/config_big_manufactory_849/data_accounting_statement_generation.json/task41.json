Identify all purchase transactions with payment method \"Account Payable\"\n2. Calculate the difference between the beginning and ending accounts payable balance\n\nLet me analyze all transactions and identify those that affect accounts payable:\n\nLooking at the data, I can see that purchases with \"Account Payable\" as the payment method represent unpaid liabilities that would be reflected in accounts payable.\n\nI find these transactions:\n1. Purchase20231231004: Amount of 3,000,000.00, payment_status is \"Unpaid\", payment_method is \"Account Payable\"\n2. Purchase20231231011: Amount of 500,000.00, payment_status is \"Unpaid\", payment_method is \"Account Payable\"\n\nThe total of unpaid purchases on account payable is: 3,000,000.00 + 500,000.00 = 3,500,000.00\n\nSince these are all unpaid purchases from the beginning of the period, and I don't see any payments made against accounts payable during the period, this represents a net increase in accounts payable of 3,500,000.00.\n\nFor the cash flow statement, an increase in accounts payable is shown as a positive figure since it represents a source of cash (the company received goods/services but has not yet paid for them).\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '3500000.00'} }\n```",
