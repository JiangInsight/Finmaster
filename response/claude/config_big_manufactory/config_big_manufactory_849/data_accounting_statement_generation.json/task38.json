This would appear as \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with the value of -6,408,987.07 in the cash flow statement.\n\nHowever, let me check if there were any initial accounts receivable or collections of previous accounts receivable to get the net change.\n\nLooking through the data, I don't see any initial accounts receivable balances mentioned or collections of previous accounts receivable. Therefore, the entire 6,408,987.07 represents the increase in accounts receivable during the period.\n\nFor the cash flow statement, this is presented as a negative value since it's an increase in accounts receivable (cash that hasn't been received):\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-6408987.07'} }\n```",
