Initial cash deposit: +5,000,000.00\n2. Purchase transactions paid in cash:\n   - Purchase20231231005: -1,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment C)\n   - Purchase20231231008: -360,000.00 (Heavy Equipment B)\n\n3. Expense transactions paid in cash:\n   - All expense transactions with payment_method \"Cash\" (there are numerous ones)\n\n4.

These reduce the cash on hand:\n\n- Transfer20240110001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240111001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240111001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240111001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240111001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240112001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240112001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240112001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240112001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240124001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240125001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240125001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240127001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240127001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240127001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240128001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240128001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240128001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240128001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240129001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240129001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240129001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240129001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240129001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240129001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240129001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240129001: -100,000.00\n- Transfer20240130001: -100,000.00\n\nTotal cash transfers: -2,800,000.00\n\nSo the final calculation:\nEnd cash balance = 5,000,000.00 + 9,979,749.26 - 2,526,325.25 - 1,000,000.00 - 2,800,000.00 = 8,653,424.01\n\nLet me double-check this calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\nActually, I noticed I need to carefully review if there are any purchases paid by cash that I might have missed:\n\nI see another cash purchase:\n- Purchase20231231008: -360,000.00 (not included before)\n\nSo let me update the calculation:\nEnd cash balance = 5,000,000.00 + 9,979,749.26 - 2,526,325.25 - 1,000,000.00 - 360,000.00 - 2,800,000.00 = 8,293,424.01\n\nTherefore, the final cash on hand is approximately 8,293,424.01.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash on Hand Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Cash on Hand End Value': '8293424.01'} }\n```",
