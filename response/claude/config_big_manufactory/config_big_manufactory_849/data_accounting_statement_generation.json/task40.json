This represents the net change in inventory value during the period, and it's important for the cash flow statement as it shows how much cash was tied up in (or released from) inventory.\n\nLet me analyze all purchase and sale transactions to determine the inventory changes:\n\n### Step 1: Identify all inventory purchases\nLooking at all \"Purchase\" transactions:\n- Purchase20231231001: 1,500,000 (Heavy Equipment D)\n- Purchase20231231002: 500,000 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Purchase20231231003: 1,600,000 (Heavy Equipment B)\n- Purchase20231231004: 3,000,000 (Heavy Equipment D)\n- Purchase20231231005: 1,000,000 (Heavy Equipment C)\n- Purchase20231231006: 2,000,000 (Heavy Equipment C)\n- Purchase20231231007: 1,000,000 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Purchase20231231008: 1,600,000 (Heavy Equipment B)\n- Purchase20231231009: 1,000,000 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Purchase20231231010: 500,000 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Purchase20231231011: 500,000 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Purchase20231231012: 1,500,000 (Heavy Equipment D)\n- Purchase20231231013: 500,000 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Purchase20231231014: 1,000,000 (Heavy Equipment C)\n\nTotal purchases: 17,200,000\n\n### Step 2: Identify all inventory sales (at cost)\nLooking at all \"Sale\" transactions (using the cost_amount which represents the inventory value of goods sold):\n- Sale20240106004: 500,000 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Sale20240108006: 1,500,000 (Heavy Equipment D)\n- Sale20240111008: 800,000 (Heavy Equipment B)\n- Sale20240114010: 500,000 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Sale20240119016: 1,000,000 (Heavy Equipment C)\n- Sale20240122019: 500,000 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Sale20240123021: 800,000 (Heavy Equipment B)\n- Sale20240124022: 500,000 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Sale20240125024: 1,500,000 (Heavy Equipment D)\n- Sale20240126025: 500,000 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Sale20240130031: 1,000,000 (Heavy Equipment C)\n- Sale20240131033: 500,000 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Sale20240202035: 500,000 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Sale20240204038: 1,500,000 (Heavy Equipment D)\n\nTotal sales (at cost): 11,600,000\n\n### Step 3: Calculate net change in inventory\nNet change in inventory = Purchases - Sales (at cost)\nNet change = 17,200,000 - 11,600,000 = 5,600,000\n\nSince this represents an increase in inventory (more was purchased than sold), and for cash flow statements we want to show the cash impact (increase in inventory uses cash), this is reported as a negative number.\n\nFor the cash flow statement, we report this as \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": -5,600,000\n\n### Step 4: Format the result\nFor better readability, let's format the number with commas and represent it with 2 decimal places:\n\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-5,600,000.00\"\n\nActually, the expected format appears to be with a negative sign and no commas, so the final answer is:\n\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-5600000.00\"\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-5600000.00'} }\n```",
