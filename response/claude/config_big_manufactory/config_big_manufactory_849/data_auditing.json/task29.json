Let me check the date:\n   - The ID is \"Sale20240204038\" suggesting Feb 4, 2024\n   - But the recorded_date shows \"2024-03-03\" (March 3)\n   - The invoice text says \"On February 04, 2024...\"\n\n2. Checking the amount:\n   - Recorded amount: $2,608,771.62\n   - Invoice amount: $2,109,215.99\n   - This is a significant discrepancy\n\n3. Examining the unit price:\n   - Recorded price: $2,405,193.00\n   - Invoice text mentions: $2,109,215.99\n\n4. Tax amount:\n   - Recorded tax: $2,322,475.53 (which seems unusually high)\n   - Invoice text mentions: $105,460.80\n\nThe invoice text is generally considered more reliable as it's standardized and regulated. Based on the invoice text, the correct values should be:\n- Date: 2024-02-04\n- Amount: $2,109,215.99\n- Unit price: $2,109,215.99\n- Tax amount: $105,460.80\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-02-04', 'Recorded date': '2024-03-03', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '2109215.99', 'Recorded price': '2405193.00', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '2109215.99', 'Recorded amount': '2608771.62', 'Original tax': '105460.80', 'Recorded tax': '2322475.53', 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240204038'} }\n```",
