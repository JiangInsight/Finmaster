For each transaction ID that appears multiple times, I'll check if the records are consistent.\n2. For each individual transaction, I'll compare the recorded fields with what's stated in the invoice description.\n\nI notice transaction ID `Expense20240121001` has an inconsistency:\n- The recorded type is \"Administrative Expenses\"\n- But the invoice states it was for \"Sales Expenses\"\n- The recorded amount is $103,315.46\n- The invoice states the amount was $83,217.37\n\nThis is clearly an inconsistency where both the category and amount don't match between the record and the invoice.\n\nThe invoice text (which is considered more reliable) states: \"On January 21, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sales Expenses, totaling $83217.37. The payment_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid. This transaction was prepared by Senior Staff, and the approver is Director.\"\n\nSo the correct category should be \"Sales Expenses\" and the correct amount should be $83,217.37.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Recorded category': 'Administrative Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '83217.37', 'Recorded amount': '103315.46', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240121001'} }\n```",
