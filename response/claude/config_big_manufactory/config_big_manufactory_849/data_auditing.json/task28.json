For Purchase20231231003, I notice several inconsistencies:\n   - The recorded date is 2024-01-07, but the ID and invoice indicate the transaction occurred on 2023-12-31\n   - The recorded amount is $1,987,438.62, but multiplying the quantity (2.0) by the unit price shown in the record ($804,693.91) gives $1,609,387.82, not matching the recorded amount\n   - The invoice clearly states the unit price should be $800,000.00 and the total $1,600,000.00\n\nThis is a clear case where the invoice information contradicts several recorded fields. The invoice mentions \"consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $800000.00, totaling $1600000.00\", which is internally consistent (2 Ã— $800,000 = $1,600,000).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": \"2023-12-31\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-07\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"800000.00\", \"Recorded price\": \"804693.91\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"1600000.00\", \"Recorded amount\": \"1987438.62\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Purchase20231231003\"}}\n```",
