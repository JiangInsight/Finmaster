Looking at recorded information:\n   - `recorded_amount`: 0.0\n   - `recorded_payment/receipt_status`: Paid\n   - `recorded_quantity`: 0.0\n   - `recorded_profit`: 183945.73\n\n2. Looking at invoice information:\n   - Amount: $660969.70 (unit price × quantity = $660969.70 × 1.0)\n   - Payment status: Unpaid (receive_method was account receivable)\n   - Quantity: 1.0 units\n   - Profit calculation: $660969.70 - $500000.00 = $160969.70\n\n3. Identified inconsistencies:\n   - The recorded amount is 0.0, but the invoice states $660969.70\n   - The recorded payment status is \"Paid\", but the invoice states \"Unpaid\" \n   - The recorded quantity is 0.0, but the invoice states 1.0 units\n   - The recorded profit is $183945.73, but based on the invoice data it should be $160969.70\n\nThe invoice explicitly states \"The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid\" which conflicts with the \"Paid\" status in the recorded data.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"0.0\", \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"660969.70\", \"Recorded amount\": \"0.0\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": \"160969.70\", \"Recorded profit\": \"183945.73\", \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240202035\"}}\n```",
