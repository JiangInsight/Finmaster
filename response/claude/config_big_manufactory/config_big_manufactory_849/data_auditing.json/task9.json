The cost amount for this transaction was $800000.00, with a tax amount of $57566.83, leading to a total amount due of $1093769.80.\"\n\nHere we have a major inconsistency. The invoice mentions the tax amount as $57566.83, but the recorded tax amount in the table is $1107784.77. This is clearly an error, as:\n\n1. The tax amount shouldn't exceed the total amount\n2. The calculation in the invoice (with tax of $57566.83) correctly leads to the after-tax amount: $1151336.63 - $57566.83 = $1093769.80\n\nTherefore, the original (correct) tax amount should be $57566.83, and the recorded amount of $1107784.77 is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': '57566.83', 'Recorded tax': '1107784.77', 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240111008'} }\n```",
