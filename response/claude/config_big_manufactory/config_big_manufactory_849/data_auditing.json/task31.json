First, I'll check the invoice text: \"On February 04, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $2109215.99, totaling $2109215.99. The cost amount for this transaction was $1500000.00, with a tax amount of $105460.80, leading to a total amount due of $2003755.19. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\n2. Now comparing with the recorded values:\n   - Recorded quantity: 0.0 (invoice shows 1.0)\n   - Recorded unit price: $2321733.08 (invoice shows $2109215.99)\n   - Recorded amount: $0.0 (invoice shows $2109215.99)\n   - Recorded tax amount: $2140290.64 (invoice shows $105460.80)\n\n3. These are significant discrepancies between the recorded values and what's stated in the invoice.\n\n4. The recorded values don't make mathematical sense:\n   - With 0 quantity, the total amount should be 0\n   - The tax amount of $2140290.64 is impossibly high for this transaction\n   - The after tax amount of $2003755.19 doesn't match what would be calculated from the recorded values\n\nBased on the invoice information, which is generally considered more reliable due to its standardized nature, I can determine the correct values:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original quantity': '1.00', 'Recorded quantity': '0.00', 'Original price': '2109215.99', 'Recorded price': '2321733.08', 'Original amount': '2109215.99', 'Recorded amount': '0.00', 'Original tax': '105460.80', 'Recorded tax': '2140290.64', 'id': 'Sale20240204038'} }\n```",
