Looking at the transaction ID \"Purchase20231231010\", I notice:\n   - The recorded_date is \"2024-01-14\" \n   - But the invoice states: \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued...\"\n   - This is a clear date inconsistency\n\n2. Examining the pricing information:\n   - The recorded_unit_price is $587,077.94\n   - But the invoice states: \"...at a unit price of $500000.00, totaling $500000.00\"\n   - This is a unit price inconsistency\n\nLet me verify the total amount matches the quantity Ã— price:\n   - Recorded quantity: 1.0\n   - Recorded amount: $500,000.00\n   - This suggests the correct unit price should indeed be $500,000.00, not $587,077.94\n\nBased on the invoice details (which are generally considered more reliable as stated in the task description), the correct date should be 2023-12-31 and the correct price should be $500,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2023-12-31', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-14', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '500000.00', 'Recorded price': '587077.94', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Purchase20231231010'} }\n```",
