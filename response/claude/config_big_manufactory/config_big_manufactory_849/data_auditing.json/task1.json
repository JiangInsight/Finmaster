The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n- The invoice explicitly states this is an \"Interest Receivables\" transaction, not \"Sales Expenses\"\n\nThis is clearly an error where the transaction type was incorrectly recorded as \"Sales Expenses\" when it should be \"Interest Receivables\" based on both the transaction ID and the invoice description.\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Interest Receivables\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Interest20240205036\"}}",
