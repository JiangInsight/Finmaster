The cost amount for this transaction was $1000000.00, with a tax amount of $74643.53, leading to a total amount due of $1418227.07. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\nNow let's compare this with the recorded data:\n- recorded_date: \"2024-02-20\" (invoice says January 30, 2024)\n- recorded_amount: $1604513.28 (invoice says $1492870.60)\n- recorded_quantity: 0.0 (invoice says 1.0)\n- recorded_unit_price: $1730784.6 (invoice says $1492870.60)\n- recorded_after_tax_amount: $1418227.07 (this matches invoice)\n- recorded_tax_amount: $74643.53 (this matches invoice)\n- recorded_cost_amount: $1000000.0 (this matches invoice)\n- recorded_profit: $492870.6 (should be $1492870.60 - $1000000.00 = $492870.60, which matches)\n\nThe main inconsistencies are:\n1. Date is recorded as February 20 instead of January 30\n2. Quantity is recorded as 0.0 instead of 1.0\n3. Unit price is recorded as $1730784.6 instead of $1492870.60\n4. Amount is recorded as $1604513.28 instead of $1492870.60\n\nSince the invoice is considered more reliable, these discrepancies should be corrected to match the invoice information.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-30', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-20', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '1.00', 'Recorded quantity': '0.00', 'Original price': '1492870.60', 'Recorded price': '1730784.60', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '1492870.60', 'Recorded amount': '1604513.28', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240130031'} }\n```",
