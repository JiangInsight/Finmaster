The recorded category is \"Depreciation\" but the invoice description states it's a \"Sales Expenses\"\n2. The recorded date is \"2024-01-28\" but the invoice description states \"2024-01-26\"\n\nThe invoice text states: \"On January 26, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sales Expenses, totaling $60508.87.\" However, the record shows:\n- recorded_type: \"Depreciation\" (should be \"Sales Expenses\")\n- recorded_date: \"2024-01-28\" (should be \"2024-01-26\")\n\nBased on this analysis, I can fill out the solution format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sales Expenses\", \"Recorded category\": \"Depreciation\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-26\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-28\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Expense20240126001\"}}\n```",
