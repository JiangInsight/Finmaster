Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\nFormula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n- Net Credit Sales = Main Business Revenue = $16,388,736.33\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2 = ($0 + $6,408,987.07) / 2 = $3,204,493.54\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $16,388,736.33 / $3,204,493.54 = 5.11\n\n## 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow generated from operations.\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\n- Operating Cash Flow = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$6,316,405.44\n- Current Liabilities = $4,319,436.82\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$6,316,405.44 / $4,319,436.82 = -1.46\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\n= -$6,316,405.44 / $4,319,436.82 = -1.46\n\n## 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\nFormula: Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\n- Net Sales = $16,388,736.33\n- Average Total Assets = (Beginning Assets + Ending Assets) / 2 = ($28,000,000 + $33,610,271.98) / 2 = $30,805,135.99\n\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = $16,388,736.33 / $30,805,135.99 = 0.53\n\n## 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures the proportion of debt a company has compared to equity.\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities = $4,319,436.82\n- Total Shareholders' Equity = $29,290,835.16\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $4,319,436.82 / $29,290,835.16 = 0.15\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '5.11', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-1.46', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.46', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.53', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15'} }\n```",
