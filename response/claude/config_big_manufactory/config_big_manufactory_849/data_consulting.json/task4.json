There are no non-current liabilities listed, so the Total Liabilities is also $4,319,436.82.\n\nStep 2: Identify the Total Owner's Equity.\nFrom the balance sheet, the Total Owner's Equity at the end date is $29,290,835.16.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio.\nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $4,319,436.82 / $29,290,835.16\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 0.1474671\n\nStep 4: Round to two decimal places.\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 0.15\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15'}}\n```",
