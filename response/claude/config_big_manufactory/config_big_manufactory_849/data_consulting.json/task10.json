First, identify the Operating Cash Flow from the cash flow statement:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,316,405.44\n\n2. Next, identify the Current Liabilities from the balance sheet:\n   - Total Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\n\n3. Calculate the ratio by dividing the Operating Cash Flow by Current Liabilities:\n   - Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -6,316,405.44 ÷ 4,319,436.82 = -1.4623 ≈ -1.46\n\nThe negative ratio indicates that the company's operations are consuming cash rather than generating it, which could potentially lead to liquidity issues if the trend continues.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.46'} }\n```",
