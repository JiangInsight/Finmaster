This ratio measures a company's ability to pay its debt obligations using its operating cash flow.\n\nThe formula for Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nStep 1: Find the Operating Cash Flow from the cash flow statement.\nFrom the cash flow statement, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,316,405.44\n\nStep 2: Find the Total Debt from the balance sheet.\nFrom the balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\nThere are no long-term liabilities shown, so Total Debt = 4,319,436.82\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio.\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -6,316,405.44 / 4,319,436.82 = -1.462\n\nStep 4: Round to two decimal places.\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -1.46\n\nTherefore, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is -1.46, indicating that the company's operating cash flow is negative and cannot cover its debt obligations.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.46'} }\n```",
