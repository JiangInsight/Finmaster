Cash components:\n   - Cash on Hand: $9,383,594.56\n   - Bank Deposits: $2,573,984.92\n   - Total Cash: $9,383,594.56 + $2,573,984.92 = $11,957,579.48\n\n2. Current Debt (Current Liabilities):\n   - Total Current Liabilities: $4,319,436.82\n\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = Total Cash / Total Current Liabilities\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = $11,957,579.48 / $4,319,436.82 = 2.77\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: 2.77\n\n{\"solution\": {'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '2.77'}}",
