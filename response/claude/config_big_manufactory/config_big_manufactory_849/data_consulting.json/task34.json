Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio:\n   - Operating Cash Flow = -6,316,405.44\n   - Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\n   - Ratio = -6,316,405.44 / 4,319,436.82 = -1.46\n\n2. Debt to Equity Ratio:\n   - Total Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\n   - Total Equity = 29,290,835.16\n   - Ratio = 4,319,436.82 / 29,290,835.16 = 0.15\n\n3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio:\n   - Revenue = 16,388,736.33\n   - Average Total Assets = (28,000,000 + 33,610,271.98) / 2 = 30,805,135.99\n   - Ratio = 16,388,736.33 / 30,805,135.99 = 0.53\n\n4. Quick Ratio:\n   - Quick Assets = Cash + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable\n   - Quick Assets = 9,383,594.56 + 2,573,984.92 + 6,408,987.07 + 23,583.67 = 18,390,150.22\n   - Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\n   - Ratio = 18,390,150.22 / 4,319,436.82 = 4.26\n\n5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\n   - Operating Cash Flow = -6,316,405.44\n   - Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\n   - Ratio = -6,316,405.44 / 4,319,436.82 = -1.46\n   (This is the same as #1 Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio)\n\n6. Return on Equity (ROE):\n   - Net Income = 1,290,835.16\n   - Average Equity = (28,000,000 + 29,290,835.16) / 2 = 28,645,417.58\n   - ROE = (1,290,835.16 / 28,645,417.58) Ã— 100% = 4.51%\n\n7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:\n   - Revenue = 16,388,736.33\n   - Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 6,408,987.07) / 2 = 3,204,493.54\n   - Ratio = 16,388,736.33 / 3,204,493.54 = 5.11\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.46', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.53', 'Quick Ratio': '4.26', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.46', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '4.51%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '5.11'} }\n```",
