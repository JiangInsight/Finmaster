It's calculated as:\n\nNet Cash Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement, I can see the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is -6,316,405.44.\n\nFor Current Liabilities, I need to look at the short-term obligations. From the cash flow statement, I can identify:\n- Accounts Payable: 3,500,000.00\n- Tax Payable: 819,436.82\n\nTotal Current Liabilities = 3,500,000.00 + 819,436.82 = 4,319,436.82\n\nNow I can calculate the Net Cash Ratio:\nNet Cash Ratio = -6,316,405.44 / 4,319,436.82 = -1.46\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: -1.46\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Ratio': '-1.46'} }\n```",
