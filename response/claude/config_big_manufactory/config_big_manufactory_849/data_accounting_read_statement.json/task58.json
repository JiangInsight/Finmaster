This represents the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 20000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThis is confirmed by looking at the balance sheet, where the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" at the initial date (2023-12-31) also equals 20000000.00:\n- Cash on Hand: 5000000.00\n- Bank Deposits: 15000000.00\n- Total: 20000000.00\n\nTherefore, the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period is 20000000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '20000000.00'} }\n```",
