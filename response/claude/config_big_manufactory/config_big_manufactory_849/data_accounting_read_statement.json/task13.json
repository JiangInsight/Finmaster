The \"Total Non-current Assets\" line item specifically represents assets that are long-term in nature and not part of the normal operating cycle.\n\n2. From the balance sheet provided, I can see:\n   - Initial value of Total Non-current Assets: 8,000,000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n   - End value of Total Non-current Assets: 9,620,121.76 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\nThese non-current assets typically include fixed assets (less accumulated depreciation) and other long-term investments or resources.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '9620121.76'}}\n```",
