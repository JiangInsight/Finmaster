Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit - this refers to Accounts Receivable from the Balance Sheet\n2. Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds - this refers to Financial Expenses from the Income Statement  \n3. Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment - this refers to Purchase of Fixed Assets from the Cash Flow Statement\n\nLet me extract these values:\n\n1. From the Balance Sheet: Accounts Receivable = 6408987.07\n2. From the Income Statement: Financial Expenses = 523627.32\n3. From the Cash Flow Statement: Purchase of Fixed Assets = 1726015.08\n\nNow I can format the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '6408987.07', 'value2': '523627.32', 'value3': '1726015.08'}}\n```",
