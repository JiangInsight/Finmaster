This is exactly what we're looking for in this task.\n\nAccording to the data:\n- The initial amount for \"Interest Receivable\" as of 2023-12-31 is 0.00\n- The end amount for \"Interest Receivable\" as of 2024-02-05 is 23583.67\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '23583.67'}}\n```",
