This represents the income generated from the entity's primary operations.\n\nThe other revenue item listed is \"Interest Income\" which is typically considered non-operating income as it's generated from financial activities rather than the core business operations.\n\nTherefore, the value of income arising from the entity's core operating activities is 16388736.33.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '16388736.33'} }\n```",
