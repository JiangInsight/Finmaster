In the income statement, there's also a line item \"Depreciation\" with the same amount of 105,893.32.\n\nDepreciation is indeed the systematic allocation of an asset's depreciable amount over its useful life. The value is consistently shown as 105,893.32 across the financial statements.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '105893.32'} }\n```",
