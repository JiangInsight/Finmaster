Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from principal revenue-producing activities (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities)\n2. Amounts of taxes accrued but not yet paid (Taxes Payable)\n3. Total income arising in the course of an entity's ordinary activities (Total Revenue)\n\nLet me examine each financial statement:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- \"Taxes Payable\" shows 819,436.82 at the end date\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- \"Total Revenue\" shows 16,388,736.33\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" shows -6,316,405.44\n\nSo the three values I need to extract are:\n- value1 (Taxes Payable): 819436.82\n- value2 (Total Revenue): 16388736.33\n- value3 (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities): -6316405.44\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '819436.82', 'value2': '16388736.33', 'value3': '-6316405.44'}}\n```",
