Initial value of Paid-in Capital: 28000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n2. End value of Paid-in Capital: 28000000.00 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\nThis represents the capital that shareholders have invested in the company in exchange for shares. The value remained unchanged during the reporting period, indicating there were no new share issuances or capital contributions during this time.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '28000000.00', 'end value': '28000000.00'}}\n```",
