In a balance sheet, expenses are typically reflected in accumulated accounts that represent the depletion or consumption of assets.\n\nThe line item \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is a contra-asset account that represents the cumulative depreciation expense recognized over time. This is clearly an expense item that appears in the profit and loss statement.\n\nFrom the data provided:\n- Initial value of Accumulated Depreciation (2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End value of Accumulated Depreciation (2024-02-05): 105893.32\n\nThis represents the depreciation expense that has been recorded during this period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '105893.32'}}\n```",
