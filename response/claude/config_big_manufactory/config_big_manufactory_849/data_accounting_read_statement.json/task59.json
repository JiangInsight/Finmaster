The amount of interest accrued but not yet received\n2. The net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\n### Balance Sheet\nFrom the balance sheet, I can see \"Interest Receivable\" with an end amount of 23,583.67. This represents interest that has been accrued but not yet received.\n\n### Income Statement\nThe income statement shows \"Interest Income\" of 23,583.67, which is consistent with the interest receivable amount.\n\n### Cash Flow Statement\nThe cash flow statement shows \"Net Increase\" in Cash and Cash Equivalents with an amount of -8,042,420.52. The negative value indicates a decrease rather than an increase.\n\nTherefore:\n1. Interest accrued but not yet received = 23,583.67\n2. Net addition in cash and cash equivalents = -8,042,420.52\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '23583.67', 'value2': '-8042420.52'} }\n```",
