Income earned by an entity from financial assets (from Income Statement)\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement carefully:\n\n### Balance Sheet\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, I can see the \"Bank Deposits\" line item with an end amount of 2,573,984.92. This represents funds deposited into a bank.\n\n### Income Statement\nLooking at the Income Statement, I can see the \"Interest Income\" line item with an amount of 23,583.67. This represents income earned by the entity from financial assets.\n\nBoth these line items match what I'm looking for:\n- Bank Deposits (funds deposited into a bank): 2,573,984.92\n- Interest Income (income earned from financial assets): 23,583.67\n\nTherefore, the solution values are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2573984.92', 'value2': '23583.67'}}\n```",
