However, this is precisely the line item that tracks changes in the amounts owed to the entity for goods or services.\n\nSince the task is asking for the specific line item and value of decrease in amounts owed, I need to extract this line item's value from the cash flow statement.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-6408987.07'}}\n```",
