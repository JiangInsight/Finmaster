The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period\n\nLooking at the income statement:\n\nFor the first value (income from core operating activities), this would typically be represented by \"Main Business Revenue\" or similar income from primary operations, which is 16388736.33.\n\nFor the second value (carrying amount of inventories sold), this corresponds to \"Cost of Goods Sold\" which represents the cost of inventory that was sold during the period, which is 11600000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16388736.33', 'value2': '11600000.00'}}\n```",
