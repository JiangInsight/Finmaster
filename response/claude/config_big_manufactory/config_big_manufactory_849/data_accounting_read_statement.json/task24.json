This represents the costs of general management and administration of the entity.\n\nIn the example provided, the solution was to extract the value of \"Administrative Expenses\", which was 1425164.20. Following the same approach for our problem, I should extract the value of \"Administrative Expenses\" which is 738427.41.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '738427.41'} }\n```",
