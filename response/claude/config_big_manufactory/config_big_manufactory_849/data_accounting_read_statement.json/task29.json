In this case, there's only one component:\n- \"Main Business Revenue\" with a value of 16388736.33\n\nThis matches the approach in the example where \"Total Revenue\" was identified as the total income value, and \"Main Business Revenue\" was its sub-item.\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '16388736.33', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '16388736.33'}}}\n```",
