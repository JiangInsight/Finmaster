I can see the section \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\"\n2. Under this section, there is one line item: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an amount of 1,726,015.08\n3. The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is reported as -1,726,015.08\n\nSince investing activities typically involve the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets, this \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is the value I need to extract.\n\nThe sub-item that contributes to this value is:\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": 1,726,015.08 (Note: this is shown as a positive number in the statement, but it's an outflow of cash, which is why the net cash flow is negative)\n\nTherefore:\n- The net amount of cash generated from investing activities is -1,726,015.08\n- The sub-item value is 1,726,015.08\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1726015.08', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '1726015.08'}} }\n```",
