This represents the increase in tax obligations that have been accrued but not yet paid during the period.\n\nTax payable refers to taxes that have been recognized as an expense but have not yet been paid to tax authorities. An increase in tax payable, as shown in this cash flow statement, means the company has accrued more tax liability than it has paid during the period.\n\nTherefore, the value of the increase in the amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid is 819436.82.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '819436.82'}}\n```",
