In the statement, I can see the line \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with a value of \"-5600000.00\".\n\nThis negative value indicates an increase in inventory (since it's labeled as \"(Increase) Decrease\"). However, the task is asking for a reduction in assets, which would be a positive value in this context.\n\nSince the inventory has increased (not decreased) by 5,600,000.00, this represents additional assets held for sale rather than a reduction. The negative sign indicates cash outflow to increase inventory.\n\nTherefore, the value representing the reduction in assets held for sale (inventory) is \"-5600000.00\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-5600000.00'}}\n```",
