Cash on hand refers to physical currency and coins, while bank deposits are funds held in checking or savings accounts that are readily accessible.\n\nBased on the example provided, it appears that only the \"Cash on Hand\" line item is being considered as the cash available for day-to-day operations. Following this pattern from the example:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '9383594.56'}}\n```",
