Looking at the recorded data:\n   - recorded_date: 2024-01-10\n   - recorded_quantity: 0.0\n   - recorded_unit_price: 803371.69\n   - recorded_amount: 0.0 (although not explicitly shown in the amount field)\n\n2. Checking the invoice information:\n   \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Purchase, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $800000.00, totaling $800000.00. The payment_method of this transaction was bank transfer, and this transaction was paid. This transaction was prepared by Supervisor, and the approver is Director. The supplier ID is S010, and the supplier name is Supplier 10.\"\n\n3. Identifying inconsistencies:\n   - Date: The invoice states December 31, 2023, but the recorded date is January 10, 2024\n   - Quantity: The invoice states 1.0 units, but the recorded quantity is 0.0\n   - Unit Price: The invoice states $800,000.00, but the recorded price is $803,371.69\n   - Total Amount: The invoice states $800,000.00, but the recorded amount shows 0.0 (though it should be $800,000.00 based on the invoice)\n\n4. The risk_issues field also notes the issues with this transaction, confirming my analysis.\n\nGiven that the invoice is considered more reliable and standardized, I'll use it as the source of truth.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": \"2023-12-31\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-10\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"0.0\", \"Original price\": \"800000.0\", \"Recorded price\": \"803371.69\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"800000.0\", \"Recorded amount\": \"0.0\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Purchase20231231007\"}}\n```",
