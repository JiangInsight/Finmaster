The cost amount for this transaction was $800000.00, with a tax amount of $52092.43, leading to a total amount due of $989756.10. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nBut the recorded data shows:\n- recorded_type: \"Administrative Expenses\" (should be \"Sale\")\n- recorded_date: \"2024-01-10\" (should be \"2024-01-04\")\n- recorded_amount: \"0.0\" (should be \"1041848.53\")\n- recorded_quantity: \"0.0\" (should be \"1.0\")\n- recorded_unit_price: \"983870.48\" (should be \"1041848.53\")\n- recorded_tax_amount: \"1019175.5\" (should be \"52092.43\")\n\nThe inconsistencies are clear when comparing the invoice to the recorded values. The transaction was incorrectly categorized, dated, and the financial values don't match the invoice.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Administrative Expenses', 'Original date': '2024-01-04', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-10', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': None, 'Recorded payment_method': None, 'Original quantity': '1.00', 'Recorded quantity': '0.00', 'Original price': '1041848.53', 'Recorded price': '983870.48', 'Original receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Original amount': '1041848.53', 'Recorded amount': '0.00', 'Original tax': '52092.43', 'Recorded tax': '1019175.50', 'Original profit': '241848.53', 'Recorded profit': '241848.53', 'Original Preparer': None, 'Recorded Preparer': None, 'Original Approver': None, 'Recorded Approver': None, 'id': 'Sale20240104001'} }\n```",
