According to the invoice text:\n\n\"On January 26, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Administrative Expenses, totaling $64584.16. The payment_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid. This transaction was prepared by Supervisor, and the approver is Director.\"\n\nHowever, in the recorded data, the \"recorded_preparer\" field is empty (None). This is an inconsistency because the invoice clearly states the preparer is \"Supervisor\" but this information is missing in the recorded data.\n\nTherefore, I identify the following inconsistency:\n- Transaction ID: Expense20240126001\n- Incorrect field: recorded_preparer \n- Recorded value: None (empty)\n- Correct value based on invoice: Supervisor\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': 'Supervisor', 'Recorded Preparer': 'None', 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240126001'} }\n```",
