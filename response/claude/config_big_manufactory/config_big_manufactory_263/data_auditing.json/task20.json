First, I notice the transaction `Purchase20231231003` has a recorded_type of \"Sale\" but the ID and invoice clearly indicate it should be a \"Purchase\":\n   - The ID starts with \"Purchase\"\n   - The invoice text states \"an invoice was issued for a Purchase\"\n   - The supplier information is included, which is typical for purchases, not sales\n   - Additionally, the recorded_unit_price (406790.41) doesn't match what's mentioned in the invoice (500000.00)\n\n2. Let me check for any other inconsistencies in the data by comparing the recorded values with what's stated in the invoices.\n\nThis analysis identifies that transaction `Purchase20231231003` contains two key inconsistencies:\n1. The transaction type is incorrectly recorded as \"Sale\" when it should be \"Purchase\" based on the ID prefix and invoice description\n2. The unit price is incorrectly recorded as 406790.41 when it should be 500000.00 as stated in the invoice\n\nTherefore, my solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Purchase\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"500000.0\", \"Recorded price\": \"406790.41\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Purchase20231231003\"}}\n```",
