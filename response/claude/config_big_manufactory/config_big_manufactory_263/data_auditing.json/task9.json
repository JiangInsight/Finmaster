The cost amount for this transaction was $1500000.00, with a tax amount of $110026.52, leading to a total amount due of $2090503.90. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nI see a significant discrepancy in the tax amount:\n- recorded_tax_amount: 2472228.68 \n- invoice tax amount: 110026.52\n\nThis is clearly an error since the tax amount should not be greater than the total amount of the sale. Also, the recorded_after_tax_amount (2090503.9) makes sense with the lower tax value from the invoice.\n\nThe remaining fields seem consistent with the invoice. The math also checks out with the invoice tax amount:\n- Sale price: 2200530.42\n- Tax (5%): 110026.52\n- After tax amount: 2090503.90\n\nTherefore, the recorded tax amount of 2472228.68 is incorrect, and it should be 110026.52 as stated in the invoice.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": \"110026.52\", \"Recorded tax\": \"2472228.68\", \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240119014\"}}\n```",
