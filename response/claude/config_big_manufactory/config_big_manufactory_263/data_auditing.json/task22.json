I'll pay special attention to the invoice field since it's mentioned as being more reliable due to its standardized nature.\n\nStarting with Purchase20231231012:\n\n1. Looking at the date:\n   - The ID indicates 20231231 (December 31, 2023)\n   - But the recorded_date shows 2024-01-20\n   - The invoice states \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued...\"\n   \n2. Looking at the price:\n   - The recorded_cost_per_unit is 800000.0\n   - The recorded_unit_price is 677096.28\n   - The invoice mentions \"at a unit price of $800000.00\"\n   - The total amount (1600000.0) divided by quantity (2.0) equals 800000.0\n\nBased on this analysis, there are two clear inconsistencies in Purchase20231231012:\n1. The date should be 2023-12-31 (from the invoice and ID), not 2024-01-20\n2. The unit price should be 800000.0 (from the invoice, ID, and cost_per_unit), not 677096.28\n\nThe invoice text confirms these values as the correct ones since it's considered more reliable due to its standardized nature.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2023-12-31', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-20', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '800000.0', 'Recorded price': '677096.28', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Purchase20231231012'} }\n```",
