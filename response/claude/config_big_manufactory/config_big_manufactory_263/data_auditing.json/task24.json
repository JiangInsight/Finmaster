The recorded amount is `582656.35` but according to the invoice, it should be `500000.00`: \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Purchase, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $500000.00, totaling $500000.00...\"\n\n2. The recorded cost per unit is `500000.0`, which matches the invoice, but the recorded unit price is `400794.46`, which is inconsistent with both the invoice and the cost per unit.\n\n3. The calculation of the total amount should be: quantity Ã— unit price. With 1.0 unit at either $500,000 or $400,794.46, the total should be the same as the unit price. However, the recorded amount of $582,656.35 doesn't match either.\n\nThis transaction contains multiple inconsistencies that cannot be reconciled internally, but the invoice information provides the most reliable reference point.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"500000.0\", \"Recorded price\": \"400794.46\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"500000.0\", \"Recorded amount\": \"582656.35\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Purchase20231231002\"}}\n```",
