The payment_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid. This transaction was prepared by Supervisor, and the approver is Director.\"\n- However, the recorded_payment_method is \"Bank Transfer\" instead of \"Cash\" as stated in the invoice.\n\nThis is clearly an inconsistency where the invoice (the more reliable source) indicates the payment method should be \"Cash\", but it was recorded as \"Bank Transfer\".\n\nLooking at transaction \"Expense20240121001\", I don't see any inconsistencies - all recorded fields match what's described in the invoice.\n\nAfter reviewing all transactions, I've found one clear inconsistency:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original payment_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Bank Transfer\", \"id\": \"Expense20240125001\"}}\n```",
