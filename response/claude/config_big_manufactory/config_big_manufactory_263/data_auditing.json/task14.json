The cost amount for this transaction was $800000.00, with a tax amount of $52092.43, leading to a total amount due of $989756.10. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nI can see two discrepancies:\n1. The quantity should be 1.0 unit (not 0.0)\n2. The payment status should be \"Unpaid\" (not \"Paid\")\n3. The amount should be 1041848.53 (not 0.0)\n\nThe risk_issues column already flags the first two issues. Based on the invoice information, which is more reliable, the correct values should be:\n- Quantity: 1.0\n- Payment/receipt status: Unpaid\n- Amount: 1041848.53\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"0.0\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Original amount\": \"1041848.53\", \"Recorded amount\": \"0.0\", \"id\": \"Sale20240104001\"}}\n```",
