Expected profit = Total amount - Cost amount = $2,200,530.42 - $1,500,000.00 = $700,530.42\n2. Recorded profit = $524,316.60\n\nThere's a clear discrepancy. The recorded profit ($524,316.60) doesn't match the expected profit ($700,530.42) based on the total amount and cost amount.\n\nThe invoice field confirms the unit price, quantity, total amount, tax amount, and after-tax amount are consistent with each other. So the inconsistency is in the recorded profit value.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": \"700530.42\", \"Recorded profit\": \"524316.6\", \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240119014\"}}\n```",
