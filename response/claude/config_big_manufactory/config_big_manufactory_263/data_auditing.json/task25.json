The payment_method of this transaction was bank transfer, and this transaction was paid. This transaction was prepared by Supervisor, and the approver is Director. The supplier ID is S010, and the supplier name is Supplier 10.\"\n\nThe invoice text confirms the transaction should be classified as a \"Purchase\", with date \"2023-12-31\", and price \"800000.0\". Since invoices are considered more reliable due to their standardized nature, I'll use that information as the source of truth.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Purchase\", \"Recorded category\": \"Depreciation\", \"Original date\": \"2023-12-31\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-25\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"800000.0\", \"Recorded price\": \"691770.28\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Purchase20231231007\"}}\n```",
