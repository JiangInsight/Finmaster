The recorded_type field shows \"Depreciation\" but this contradicts multiple pieces of evidence:\n   - The ID starts with \"Sale\" indicating it should be a sale transaction\n   - The invoice text clearly states it was a Sale: \"On January 19, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale...\"\n   - It has product information, quantity, unit price, cost amount, and profit - all characteristics of a sale transaction, not depreciation\n\n2. There's also a discrepancy in the receive_method:\n   - The recorded_receive_method shows \"Cash\"\n   - But the invoice text clearly states: \"The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable\"\n   - The recorded_payment/receipt_status is also \"Unpaid\" which is consistent with account receivable, not cash\n\nThese inconsistencies appear to be errors in data entry where the transaction type was incorrectly recorded as \"Depreciation\" instead of \"Sale\" and the receive method was incorrectly recorded as \"Cash\" instead of \"Account Receviable\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Depreciation', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Cash', 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240119014'} }\n```",
