I'll pay special attention to the invoice field, which is more reliable due to its standardized nature.\n\nLet me examine the purchase transaction where I see a potential issue:\n\nFor transaction ID: Purchase20231231009, I notice a discrepancy between fields:\n\n1. The transaction shows a total amount of $500,000 and the cost_per_unit is also $500,000 for 1 unit.\n2. However, the recorded unit price is $451,576.12.\n3. The invoice states: \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Purchase, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $500000.00, totaling $500000.00.\"\n\nThis is an inconsistency since the recorded unit price ($451,576.12) doesn't match the unit price mentioned in the invoice ($500,000). Since the invoice is considered more reliable, and it aligns with the recorded total amount and cost_per_unit, I believe the recorded unit price is incorrect.\n\nThe correct value should be $500,000.00, which matches the invoice, the recorded total amount, and the recorded cost per unit.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"500000.00\", \"Recorded price\": \"451576.12\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Purchase20231231009\"}}\n```",
