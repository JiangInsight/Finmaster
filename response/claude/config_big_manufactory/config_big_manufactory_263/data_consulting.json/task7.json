The basic formula for FCF is:\n\nFCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -17,417,367.15\n- Capital Expenditures (Purchase of Fixed Assets): 0.00\n\nFCF = -17,417,367.15 - 0.00 = -17,417,367.15\n\nI can confirm this is correct by checking the Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents, which is also -17,417,367.15.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-17417367.15'}}\n```",
