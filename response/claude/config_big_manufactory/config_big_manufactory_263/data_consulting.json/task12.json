                        "content": "I need to calculate the Return on Equity (ROE) for the given problem. ROE measures how efficiently a company uses its equity to generate profits.\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\nROE = Net Profit / Average Shareholders' Equity × 100%\n\nLet me gather the required values:\n\n1. Net Profit = $405,999.64 (from the income statement)\n\n2. For Average Shareholders' Equity, I need:\n   - Beginning Equity = $28,000,000.00 (from the initial balance sheet)\n   - Ending Equity = $28,405,999.64 (from the ending balance sheet)\n   - Average Equity = (Beginning Equity + Ending Equity) / 2\n   - Average Equity = ($28,000,000.00 + $28,405,999.64) / 2 = $28,202,999.82\n\n3. Now I can calculate ROE:\n   ROE = $405,999.64 / $28,202,999.82 × 100% = 1.44%\n\nTherefore, the Return on Equity (ROE) is 1.44%.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '1.44%'}}\n```",
