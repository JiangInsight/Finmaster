                        "content": "I need to calculate several financial ratios based on the given financial statements. Let's work through each one step by step.\n\n## 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\nFormula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nSince we only have ending accounts receivable (no beginning value), I'll use that:\n- Net Credit Sales = Main Business Revenue = $14,542,813.42\n- Accounts Receivable = $10,221,447.35\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $14,542,813.42 / $10,221,447.35 = 1.42\n\n## 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio (same as Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio)\nThis measures a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with its operating cash flow.\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\n- Operating Cash Flow = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$17,417,367.15\n- Current Liabilities = $727,140.68\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$17,417,367.15 / $727,140.68 = -23.95\n\n## 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\nFormula: Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\n- Net Sales = $14,542,813.42\n- Average Total Assets = (Initial Total Assets + End Total Assets) / 2\n  = ($28,000,000.00 + $29,133,140.32) / 2 = $28,566,570.16\n\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = $14,542,813.42 / $28,566,570.16 = 0.51\n\n## 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures a company's financial leverage.\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities = $727,140.68 (only current liabilities in this case)\n- Total Equity = $28,405,999.64\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $727,140.68 / $28,405,999.64 = 0.03\n\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '1.42', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-23.95', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-23.95', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.51', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03'}}",
