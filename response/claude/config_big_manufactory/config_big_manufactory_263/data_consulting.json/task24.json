Debt to Asset Ratio\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $727,140.68\n- Total Assets = $29,133,140.32\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $727,140.68 / $29,133,140.32 = 0.025 (rounded to 3 decimal places)\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nFrom the cash flow statement and income statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$17,417,367.15\n- Net Profit = $405,999.64\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = -$17,417,367.15 / $405,999.64 = -42.90 (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\nThe negative ratio indicates that while the company is profitable, it's using significantly more cash than it's generating in accounting profit.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.025\", \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-42.90\"}}\n```",
