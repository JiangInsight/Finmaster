                        "content": "I'll calculate each ratio step by step, using the provided financial statements.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with the operating cash flow.\n- Operating Cash Flow = -$17,417,367.15\n- Current Liabilities = $727,140.68\n- Ratio = -17,417,367.15 ÷ 727,140.68 = -23.95\n\n## 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures a company's financial leverage.\n- Total Liabilities = $727,140.68\n- Total Equity = $28,405,999.64\n- Ratio = 727,140.68 ÷ 28,405,999.64 = 0.026\n\n## 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n- Revenue = $14,542,813.42\n- Average Total Assets = (28,000,000 + 29,133,140.32) ÷ 2 = $28,566,570.16\n- Ratio = 14,542,813.42 ÷ 28,566,570.16 = 0.51\n\n## 4. Quick Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n- Quick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = $21,224,639.20 - $8,400,000 = $12,824,639.20\n- Current Liabilities = $727,140.68\n- Ratio = 12,824,639.20 ÷ 727,140.68 = 17.64\n\n## 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n- Ratio = -23.95\n\n## 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\nThis measures a company's profitability relative to its equity.\n- Net Income = $405,999.64\n- Average Equity = (28,000,000 + 28,405,999.64) ÷ 2 = $28,202,999.82\n- ROE = 405,999.64 ÷ 28,202,999.82 = 0.0144 or 1.44%\n\n## 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company collects on its receivables.\n- Revenue = $14,542,813.42\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 10,221,447.35) ÷ 2 = $5,110,723.68\n- Ratio = 14,542,813.42 ÷ 5,110,723.68 = 2.85\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-23.95', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.026', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.51', 'Quick Ratio': '17.64', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-23.95', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '1.44%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.85'} }\n```",
