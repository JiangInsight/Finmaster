Typically, this would be listed as \"Paid-in Capital,\" \"Share Capital,\" or something similar.\n\nIn the provided balance sheet, I can see the following relevant line:\n- \"Paid-in Capital\" with:\n  - Initial amount: 28000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n  - End amount: 28000000.00 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\nThis line item represents the capital that shareholders have contributed in exchange for shares in the company. The amount remained unchanged between the initial and end dates.\n\nTherefore, the capital contributed by shareholders is:\n- Initial value: 28000000.00\n- End value: 28000000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '28000000.00', 'end value': '28000000.00'}}\n```",
