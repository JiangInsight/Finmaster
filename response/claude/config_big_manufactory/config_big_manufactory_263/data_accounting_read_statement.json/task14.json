These are the liabilities that will be paid off in the short term.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet provided:\n\n1. I can see the line item \"Total Current Liabilities\" which represents all liabilities expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle.\n\n2. The initial value of Total Current Liabilities as of 2023-12-31 is 0.00\n\n3. The end value of Total Current Liabilities as of 2024-02-05 is 727140.68\n\nTherefore, the values I need to extract are:\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- End value: 727140.68\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '727140.68'}}\n```",
