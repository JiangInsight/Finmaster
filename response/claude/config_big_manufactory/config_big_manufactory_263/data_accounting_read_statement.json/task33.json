The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period\n\nLooking at the income statement:\n\nFor the first value, I need to find the revenue from core operations. In this statement, this is represented by \"Main Business Revenue\" with a value of 14,542,813.42.\n\nFor the second value, I need to find the cost of inventories sold, which is represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with a value of 10,400,000.00.\n\nTherefore, the two values I need to extract are:\n- value1: 14542813.42 (Main Business Revenue)\n- value2: 10400000.00 (Cost of Goods Sold)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '14542813.42', 'value2': '10400000.00'}}\n```",
