Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense (from Income Statement)\n2. Addition in amount owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit (accounts payable from Balance Sheet)\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares (paid-in capital from Balance Sheet)\n\nLet me analyze each statement:\n\n1. From the Income Statement, I can see \"Profit Before Tax\" is 1133140.32\n\n2. From the Balance Sheet, \"Accounts Payable\" shows no change (0.00), so there's no addition in amounts owed\n\n3. From the Balance Sheet, \"Paid-in Capital\" is 28000000.00\n\nTherefore:\n- value1 = 28000000.00 (Paid-in Capital)\n- value2 = 1133140.32 (Profit Before Tax)\n- value3 = 0.00 (Accounts Payable)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28000000.00', 'value2': '1133140.32', 'value3': '0.00'}}\n```",
