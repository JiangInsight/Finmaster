It appears the entity did not make any purchases on credit during this time frame, or if they did make purchases on credit, they paid them off entirely within the same period.\n\nSince there is no addition to accounts payable or similar credit accounts, the value would be 0.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'} }\n```",
