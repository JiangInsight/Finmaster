                        "content": "I need to identify and extract four specific line items from the income statement:\n\n1. Costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services (Selling Expenses)\n2. Financing costs incurred to raise funds (Financial Expenses)\n3. Systematic allocation of depreciable asset amount (Depreciation)\n4. Total taxes expected to pay or recover (Tax Expense)\n\nLooking at the income statement provided:\n\n- Selling Expenses: 963185.37\n- Depreciation: 91498.88\n- Financial Expenses: 559176.01\n- Tax Expense: 727140.68\n\nThese are the four values I need to extract, in the original order they appear in the statement.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '963185.37', 'value2': '559176.01', 'value3': '91498.88', 'value4': '727140.68'}}\n```\n\nWait, I need to check the order once more. In the task description, it asks for:\n1. Selling Expenses (costs to secure customer orders) = 963185.37\n2. Financial Expenses (financing costs) = 559176.01\n3. Depreciation (allocation of depreciable amount) = 91498.88\n4. Tax Expense (total taxes) = 727140.68\n\nBut I need to maintain the original order as shown in the statement, which is:\n1. Selling Expenses = 963185.37\n2. Depreciation = 91498.88\n3. Financial Expenses = 559176.01\n4. Tax Expense = 727140.68\n\nSo my final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '963185.37', 'value2': '91498.88', 'value3': '559176.01', 'value4': '727140.68'}}\n```",
