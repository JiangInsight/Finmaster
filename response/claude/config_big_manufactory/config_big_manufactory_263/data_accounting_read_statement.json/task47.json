This represents the change in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\nThe two component sub-items that make up this net change are:\n1. Beginning Balance: 20000000.00\n2. Ending Balance: 2582632.85\n\nWe can verify this is correct because:\nBeginning Balance - Ending Balance = Net Decrease\n20000000.00 - 2582632.85 = 17417367.15 (as a negative number)\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-17417367.15', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '20000000.00', 'sub_item value2': '2582632.85'}}}\n```",
