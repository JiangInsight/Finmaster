From Balance Sheet: amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit\n2. From Income Statement: financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds\n3. From Cash Flow Statement: cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment\n\nLet me analyze each statement carefully:\n\n1. From the Balance Sheet, \"Accounts Receivable\" represents amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit. The end amount is 10221447.35.\n\n2. From the Income Statement, \"Financial Expenses\" represents financing costs incurred by the enterprise. The amount is 559176.01.\n\n3. From the Cash Flow Statement, \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" represents cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment. The amount is 0.00.\n\nThese are the three specific values I need to extract.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '10221447.35', 'value2': '559176.01', 'value3': '0.00'} }\n```",
