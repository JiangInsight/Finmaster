In the balance sheet, these are represented by the \"Total Non-current Assets\" line item.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n1. The initial value of \"Total Non-current Assets\" as of 2023-12-31 is 8000000.00\n2. The end value of \"Total Non-current Assets\" as of 2024-02-05 is 7908501.12\n\nThese values represent the assets that are not expected to be realized or consumed within the normal operating cycle of the business.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '7908501.12'}}\n```",
