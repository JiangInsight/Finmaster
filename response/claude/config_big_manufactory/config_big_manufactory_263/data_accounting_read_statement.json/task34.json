The total income arising in the course of an entity's ordinary activities\n2. The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period\n3. The costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole\n\nLooking at the statement:\n\n1. Total income is represented by \"Total Revenue\" with a value of 14542813.42\n2. The carrying amount of inventories sold is represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with a value of 10400000.00\n3. The costs of general management and administration is represented by \"Administrative Expenses\" with a value of 1416371.84\n\nTherefore, the three values I need to extract are:\n- value1: 14542813.42\n- value2: 10400000.00\n- value3: 1416371.84\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '14542813.42', 'value2': '10400000.00', 'value3': '1416371.84'}}\n```",
