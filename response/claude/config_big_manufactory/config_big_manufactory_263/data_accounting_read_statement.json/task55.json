In the balance sheet, I see \"Taxes Payable\" with an ending amount of 727140.68 as of 2024-02-05.\n\n2. In the income statement, I see \"Tax Expense\" of 727140.68 as of 2024-02-05.\n\n3. In the cash flow statement, I see \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" of 727140.68.\n\nThe tax expense from the income statement represents the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay for the reporting period. This matches the amount in \"Taxes Payable\" on the balance sheet and the change in tax payable in the cash flow statement.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period is 727140.68.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '727140.68'} }\n```",
