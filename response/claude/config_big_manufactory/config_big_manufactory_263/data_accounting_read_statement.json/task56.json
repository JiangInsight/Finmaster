In the balance sheet as \"Accumulated Depreciation\" with an end amount of 91,498.88\n2. In the cash flow statement as \"Depreciation\" with an amount of 91,498.88\n3. In the income statement as \"Depreciation\" with an amount of 91,498.88\n\nThe question is asking for the specific line item and value of the depreciation expense. In financial accounting, this would be the amount recognized in the income statement during the period, which represents the systematic allocation of the asset's depreciable amount over its useful life.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the \"Depreciation\" line from the income statement, with a value of 91,498.88.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91498.88'} }\n```",
