                        "content": "To solve this task, I need to identify the specific line items and values representing cash that is available for day-to-day operations.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, I can see the following potential cash items:\n1. Cash on Hand: Initial amount = 5,000,000.00 (2023-12-31), End amount = 1,482,632.85 (2024-02-05)\n2. Bank Deposits: Initial amount = 15,000,000.00 (2023-12-31), End amount = 1,100,000.00 (2024-02-05)\n\nIn accounting, \"Cash on Hand\" typically refers to physical currency and coins available for immediate use, while \"Bank Deposits\" refers to money in checking or savings accounts that is also readily available for day-to-day operations.\n\nBased on the example solution provided, it appears that only \"Cash on Hand\" was considered as the cash available for day-to-day operations. However, in modern business practice, both cash on hand and bank deposits are typically considered part of the cash available for operational use.\n\nSince the example only used \"Cash on Hand\" as the answer, I will follow the same approach for consistency.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '1482632.85'}}\n```",
