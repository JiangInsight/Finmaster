An increase in accounts receivable means more customers owe the company money, while a decrease means more customers have paid what they owe.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement provided, I can see the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with a value of \"-10221447.35\".\n\nThe negative sign here indicates this is an increase in accounts receivable (more money owed to the company), not a decrease. However, the task specifically asks for the value of a decrease. Since the question is asking about decreases specifically, and the actual value represents an increase, I should report the value exactly as shown in the statement.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-10221447.35'}}\n```",
