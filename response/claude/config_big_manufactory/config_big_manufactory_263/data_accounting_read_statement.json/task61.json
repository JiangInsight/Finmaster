Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets\n\nLet me examine the financial statements systematically:\n\nFor the first item, I need to look for selling expenses or similar costs in the income statement. In this case, I can see \"Selling Expenses\" with a value of 963185.37.\n\nFor the second item, I need to look for capital expenditures or purchase of fixed assets in the cash flow statement. I can see \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of 0.00.\n\nLooking at each statement:\n- Balance Sheet: No direct line items related to these specific costs\n- Income Statement: Contains \"Selling Expenses\" of 963185.37\n- Cash Flow Statement: Contains \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" of 0.00\n\nTherefore, my solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '963185.37', 'value2': '0.00'}}\n```",
