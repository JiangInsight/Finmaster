These are physical assets that the company owns and uses in its operations over multiple periods.\n\nIn the balance sheet:\n- Fixed Assets initial amount (2023-12-31): 8000000.00\n- Fixed Assets end amount (2024-02-05): 8000000.00\n\nNote that there is also accumulated depreciation, which is a contra-asset account that reduces the value of fixed assets, but the question asks for the specific line item of tangible items, which is the Fixed Assets line.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
