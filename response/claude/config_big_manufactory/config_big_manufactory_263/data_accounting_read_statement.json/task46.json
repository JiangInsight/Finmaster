The negative sign in front of the 0.00 indicates that investing activities usually result in cash outflows (negative values), but in this case, no investments were made.\n\nSince the value is -0.00, I'll represent it as \"0.00\" without the negative sign to avoid confusion. The sub-item component is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of 0.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '0.00'}}}\n```",
