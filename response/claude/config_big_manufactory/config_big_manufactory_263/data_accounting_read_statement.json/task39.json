I need to look for the inventory line item in the cash flow statement.\n\nLooking at the given cash flow statement, I can see the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with a value of \"-8400000.00\".\n\nThis negative value indicates an increase in inventory (since it's showing \"(Increase) Decrease\" and the negative value means it's an increase). However, the task is asking for a reduction in assets, which would be represented by a positive value for \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\".\n\nSince the value is negative (-8400000.00), it means inventory increased rather than decreased. There is no reduction in inventory shown in this cash flow statement. However, the task specifically asks for the value representing the reduction, and the value related to inventory changes is \"-8400000.00\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-8400000.00'}}\n```",
