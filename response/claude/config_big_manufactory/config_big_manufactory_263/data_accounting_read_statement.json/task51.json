This is exactly what I'm looking for.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial amount (as of 2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End amount (as of 2024-02-05): 20559.00\n\nThis is also confirmed in the cash flow statement which shows \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" of -20559.00, indicating an increase in interest receivable during the period.\n\nFurther, the income statement shows \"Interest Income\" of 20559.00, which matches the end amount of interest receivable. This suggests that all the interest earned during this period has not yet been received in cash.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '20559.00'}}\n```",
