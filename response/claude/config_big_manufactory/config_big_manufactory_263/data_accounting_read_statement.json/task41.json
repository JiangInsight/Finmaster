In cash flow statements, this typically appears as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" or similar wording.\n\nIn the provided statement, I can see the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with a value of 727140.68. This represents the increase in the amount of tax that has been accrued but not yet paid during the period.\n\nSince this is a positive number, it indicates an increase in tax payable, which means more tax has been accrued than paid during the period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '727140.68'}}\n```",
