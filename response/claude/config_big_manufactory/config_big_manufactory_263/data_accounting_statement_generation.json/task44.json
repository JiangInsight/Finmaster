Looking for transactions that clearly indicate fixed asset purchases\n2. These would typically be labeled as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar\n\nLet me go through the transaction data and identify any fixed asset purchases:\n\nExamining the data, I'm looking specifically for:\n- Transactions with \"Fixed Assets\" in the type column\n- Transactions that represent capital expenditures\n\nFrom the transaction data, I can see:\n\n1. Initial20231231001 with type \"Fixed Assets\" (amount: 8000000.0) - this appears to be an initial balance rather than a purchase\n2. There are multiple \"Purchase\" transactions, but they refer to inventory/products (Heavy Equipment A, B, C, D), which are likely inventory for resale rather than fixed assets for company use\n\nLooking further, I don't see any explicit transactions labeled as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" in this dataset.\n\nIn the example provided, there was a transaction \"FixedAsset20231231001\" with type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" and amount 305354.43, which was identified as the purchase of fixed assets.\n\nSince there are no transactions explicitly labeled as fixed asset purchases in the current dataset, the purchase of fixed assets for the cash flow statement would be 0.\n\nHowever, I should consider if any of the \"Purchase\" transactions might actually be fixed assets. Given the nature of the business (appears to be selling heavy equipment), the purchases labeled with product IDs (P001, P002, P003, P004) all seem to be inventory for resale rather than fixed assets, as they are later sold to customers.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '0'} }\n```",
