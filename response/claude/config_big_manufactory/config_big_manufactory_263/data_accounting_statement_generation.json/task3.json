Initial inventory value:\nLooking at the data, there are no explicit \"Initial Inventory\" entries. Since there's no opening balance stated for inventory, we'll start with 0.00.\n\n2. Identifying inventory purchases:\nAll transactions with \"type\" of \"Purchase\" will increase inventory.\n\n3. Identifying inventory reductions:\nAll transactions with \"type\" of \"Sale\" will decrease inventory.\n\nLet me track each purchase and sale:\n\n**Purchases:**\n- Purchase20231231001: Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit × 800,000 = 800,000\n- Purchase20231231002: Heavy Equipment A, 1 unit × 500,000 = 500,000\n- Purchase20231231003: Heavy Equipment A, 2 units × 500,000 = 1,000,000\n- Purchase20231231004: Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit × 800,000 = 800,000\n- Purchase20231231005: Heavy Equipment C, 2 units × 1,000,000 = 2,000,000\n- Purchase20231231006: Heavy Equipment D, 2 units × 1,500,000 = 3,000,000\n- Purchase20231231007: Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit × 800,000 = 800,000\n- Purchase20231231008: Heavy Equipment C, 2 units × 1,000,000 = 2,000,000\n- Purchase20231231009: Heavy Equipment A, 1 unit × 500,000 = 500,000\n- Purchase20231231010: Heavy Equipment D, 2 units × 1,500,000 = 3,000,000\n- Purchase20231231011: Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit × 800,000 = 800,000\n- Purchase20231231012: Heavy Equipment B, 2 units × 800,000 = 1,600,000\n- Purchase20231231013: Heavy Equipment C, 2 units × 1,000,000 = 2,000,000\n\nTotal purchases: 18,800,000\n\n**Sales:**\n- Sale20240104001: Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit × 800,000 = 800,000\n- Sale20240108002: Heavy Equipment C, 1 unit × 1,000,000 = 1,000,000\n- Sale20240109003: Heavy Equipment C, 1 unit × 1,000,000 = 1,000,000\n- Sale20240113005: Heavy Equipment A, 1 unit × 500,000 = 500,000\n- Sale20240114007: Heavy Equipment A, 1 unit × 500,000 = 500,000\n- Sale20240115009: Heavy Equipment D, 1 unit × 1,500,000 = 1,500,000\n- Sale20240118012: Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit × 800,000 = 800,000\n- Sale20240119014: Heavy Equipment D, 1 unit × 1,500,000 = 1,500,000\n- Sale20240120015: Heavy Equipment C, 1 unit × 1,000,000 = 1,000,000\n- Sale20240122018: Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit × 800,000 = 800,000\n- Sale20240125020: Heavy Equipment C, 1 unit × 1,000,000 = 1,000,000\n\nTotal sales: 10,400,000\n\nNow I can calculate the ending inventory value:\nInitial inventory (0) + Purchases (18,800,000) - Sales (10,400,000) = 8,400,000\n\nTherefore:\n- Initial inventory value: 0.00\n- Ending inventory value: 8,400,000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Initial Value': '0.00', 'Inventory End Value': '8400000.00'}}\n```",
