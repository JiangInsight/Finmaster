                        "content": "I need to calculate the total cost of goods sold from this dataset. The cost of goods sold (COGS) is determined by looking at the sales transactions and summing up the cost amounts of all sold goods.\n\nLet me go through the dataset and find all sale transactions:\n\n1. Find all records with type \"Sale\"\n2. For each sale, extract the cost_amount which represents the cost of the goods sold\n3. Sum up all these cost_amount values\n\nGoing through the data, I can see these sale transactions:\n\n1. Sale20240104001: Heavy Equipment B - cost_amount = 800,000.0\n2. Sale20240108002: Heavy Equipment C - cost_amount = 1,000,000.0\n3. Sale20240109003: Heavy Equipment C - cost_amount = 1,000,000.0\n4. Sale20240113005: Heavy Equipment A - cost_amount = 500,000.0\n5. Sale20240114007: Heavy Equipment A - cost_amount = 500,000.0\n6. Sale20240115009: Heavy Equipment D - cost_amount = 1,500,000.0\n7. Sale20240118012: Heavy Equipment B - cost_amount = 800,000.0\n8. Sale20240119014: Heavy Equipment D - cost_amount = 1,500,000.0\n9. Sale20240120015: Heavy Equipment C - cost_amount = 1,000,000.0\n10. Sale20240122018: Heavy Equipment B - cost_amount = 800,000.0\n11. Sale20240125020: Heavy Equipment C - cost_amount = 1,000,000.0\n\nAdding these up:\n800,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 + 1,500,000 + 800,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,000,000 + 800,000 + 1,000,000 = 10,400,000\n\nTherefore, the cost of goods sold is 10,400,000.00.\n\nLet me check my work by verifying if the cost_amount matches with the product_id, cost_per_unit, and quantity. For each sale:\n- The cost_amount generally equals cost_per_unit * quantity\n\nLooking at the data, this appears to be the case for all transactions, as the quantity is 1 for each sale, and the cost_amount equals the cost_per_unit.\n\nTherefore, the final cost of goods sold is 10,400,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cost of Goods Sold': '10400000.00'}}\n```",
