Let me refine my calculations:\n\nThe cash flow from operating activities is negative because even though the profit is positive, the increases in accounts receivable and inventory represent uses of cash.\n\nThe final result:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Net Profit\": \"11371913.48\", \"Depreciation\": \"91498.88\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-10221447.35\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-22835.20\", \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-19300000.00\", \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"0.00\", \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"727740.68\", \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-17353129.51\", \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.00\", \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"8000000.00\", \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-8000000.00\", \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": \"0.00\", \"Beginning Balance\": \"20000000.00\", \"Ending Balance\": \"3941965.01\", \"Net Increase\": \"-16058034.99\"}}",
