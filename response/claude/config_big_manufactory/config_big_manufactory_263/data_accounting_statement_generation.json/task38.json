Sale20240104001 - Amount: $1,041,848.53 - Receive method: Account Receivable\n2. Sale20240108002 - Amount: $1,378,082.08 - Receive method: Account Receivable\n3. Sale20240113005 - Amount: $668,830.84 - Receive method: Account Receivable\n4. Sale20240115009 - Amount: $2,106,067.17 - Receive method: Account Receivable\n5. Sale20240119014 - Amount: $2,200,530.42 - Receive method: Account Receivable\n6. Sale20240120015 - Amount: $1,497,917.10 - Receive method: Account Receivable\n7. Sale20240125020 - Amount: $1,328,171.21 - Receive method: Account Receivable\n\n## Step 2: Calculate total sales on credit (accounts receivable)\nThe total of all sales on credit is:\n$1,041,848.53 + $1,378,082.08 + $668,830.84 + $2,106,067.17 + $2,200,530.42 + $1,497,917.10 + $1,328,171.21 = $10,221,447.35\n\n## Step 3: Verify if any receivables were collected during the period\nLooking through the data, I don't see any transactions specifically showing collection of previously recorded accounts receivable.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final accounts receivable item\nSince all of these receivables were created during this period and none appear to have been collected, the accounts receivable increased by $10,221,447.35.\n\nFor the cash flow statement, an increase in accounts receivable is shown as a negative number (as it represents cash that has not been received). Therefore, the final accounts receivable item in the cash flow statement would be:\n\n(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable = -$10,221,447.35\n\nHowever, I need to format this number according to the requested format, so I'll remove the negative sign and present it as an increase:\n\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-10221447.35'} }\n\nActually, let me double-check my calculation by rounding:\n$1,041,848.53 + $1,378,082.08 + $668,830.84 + $2,106,067.17 + $2,200,530.42 + $1,497,917.10 + $1,328,171.21 = $10,221,447.35\n\nThis confirms my original calculation.\n\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-10221447.35'} }",
