This involves analyzing the purchase and sale transactions to determine the net change in inventory.\n\nLet me go through the problem step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll identify all purchase transactions that add to inventory\n2. Then I'll identify all sales transactions that reduce inventory\n3. Calculate the net change in inventory (purchases - cost of goods sold)\n4. Format the result as required\n\n### Step 1: Identify all purchase transactions\n\nLooking at all the purchase transactions in the data:\n\n| Transaction ID | Amount | Product | Quantity |\n|----------------|--------|---------|----------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | 800,000.0 | Heavy Equipment B | 1.0 |\n| Purchase20231231002 | 500,000.0 | Heavy Equipment A | 1.0 |\n| Purchase20231231003 | 1,000,000.0 | Heavy Equipment A | 2.0 |\n| Purchase20231231004 | 800,000.0 | Heavy Equipment B | 1.0 |\n| Purchase20231231005 | 2,000,000.0 | Heavy Equipment C | 2.0 |\n| Purchase20231231006 | 3,000,000.0 | Heavy Equipment D | 2.0 |\n| Purchase20231231007 | 800,000.0 | Heavy Equipment B | 1.0 |\n| Purchase20231231008 | 2,000,000.0 | Heavy Equipment C | 2.0 |\n| Purchase20231231009 | 500,000.0 | Heavy Equipment A | 1.0 |\n| Purchase20231231010 | 3,000,000.0 | Heavy Equipment D | 2.0 |\n| Purchase20231231011 | 800,000.0 | Heavy Equipment B | 1.0 |\n| Purchase20231231012 | 1,600,000.0 | Heavy Equipment B | 2.0 |\n| Purchase20231231013 | 2,000,000.0 | Heavy Equipment C | 2.0 |\n\nTotal purchases: 18,800,000.0\n\n### Step 2: Identify all sales transactions (cost amount)\n\nFor sales, I need to look at the cost_amount column which represents the inventory value of the sold items:\n\n| Transaction ID | Cost Amount | Product | Quantity |\n|----------------|-------------|---------|----------|\n| Sale20240104001 | 800,000.0 | Heavy Equipment B | 1.0 |\n| Sale20240108002 | 1,000,000.0 | Heavy Equipment C | 1.0 |\n| Sale20240109003 | 1,000,000.0 | Heavy Equipment C | 1.0 |\n| Sale20240113005 | 500,000.0 | Heavy Equipment A | 1.0 |\n| Sale20240114007 | 500,000.0 | Heavy Equipment A | 1.0 |\n| Sale20240115009 | 1,500,000.0 | Heavy Equipment D | 1.0 |\n| Sale20240118012 | 800,000.0 | Heavy Equipment B | 1.0 |\n| Sale20240119014 | 1,500,000.0 | Heavy Equipment D | 1.0 |\n| Sale20240120015 | 1,000,000.0 | Heavy Equipment C | 1.0 |\n| Sale20240122018 | 800,000.0 | Heavy Equipment B | 1.0 |\n| Sale20240125020 | 1,000,000.0 | Heavy Equipment C | 1.0 |\n\nTotal cost of goods sold: 10,400,000.0\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the net change in inventory\n\nNet change in inventory = Total purchases - Total cost of goods sold\nNet change in inventory = 18,800,000.0 - 10,400,000.0 = 8,400,000.0\n\nFor the cash flow statement, an increase in inventory is shown as a negative number (cash outflow), and a decrease in inventory is shown as a positive number (cash inflow).\n\nSince we have a net increase in inventory of 8,400,000.0, this represents a cash outflow, so the value would be -8,400,000.0 in the cash flow statement.\n\n### Step 4: Format the result\n\nFor the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" line item, the value is -8,400,000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-8400000.00'} }\n```\n\nWait, I need to validate my calculations again. Let me double-check the figures:\n\nTotal purchases: 18,800,000.0\nTotal cost of goods sold: 10,400,000.0\nNet change (increase) in inventory: 8,400,000.0\n\nThis represents a net cash outflow, so in the cash flow statement it would be presented as a negative number: -8,400,000.00\n\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-8400000.00'} }",
