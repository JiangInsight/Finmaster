January 2: 95,031.07\n2. January 3: 76,088.96\n3. January 19: 18,332.13\n4. January 26: 75,582.46\n5. January 27: 78,160.43\n6. January 30: 69,587.16\n7. January 31: 77,099.29\n8. February 2: 39,264.18\n9. February 5: 30,030.33\n\nLet me sum these amounts:\n- 95,031.07\n- 76,088.96\n- 18,332.13\n- 75,582.46\n- 78,160.43\n- 69,587.16\n- 77,099.29\n- 39,264.18\n- 30,030.33\n\nTotal financial expenses = 559,176.01\n\nTherefore, the final financial expenses item in the income statement is 559,176.01.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Financial Expenses': '559176.01'} }\n```",
