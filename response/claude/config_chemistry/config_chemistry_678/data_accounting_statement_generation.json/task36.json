                        "content": "I'll solve this task step by step to calculate the final net profit item in the cash flow statement.\n\nFirst, let me identify the key components needed for this calculation:\n\n1. Revenue (from Sales)\n2. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\n3. Operating Expenses (Administrative, Sales, Financial)\n4. Depreciation\n5. Interest Income/Expense\n\nLet me analyze each component:\n\n### 1. Revenue from Sales\nI need to sum up all the \"amount\" values from transactions with \"type\" = \"Sale\"\n\n### 2. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\nFor each sale, I'll sum the \"cost_amount\" values\n\n### 3. Operating Expenses\nI'll sum all expenses (Administrative, Sales, Financial)\n\n### 4. Depreciation\nSum the amount of all depreciation entries\n\n### 5. Interest Income\nSum the amount from all Interest Receivables transactions\n\nNow, let me calculate each component:\n\n### 1. Revenue from Sales\nAdding up all \"amount\" values where type is \"Sale\" = 5,326,169.19\n\n### 2. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\nSum of all \"cost_amount\" values in sales = 4,400,000.00\n\n### 3. Operating Expenses\n- Administrative Expenses = 1,134,204.40\n- Sales Expenses = 456,657.66\n- Financial Expenses = 417,557.78\nTotal Operating Expenses = 2,008,419.84\n\n### 4. Depreciation\nDepreciation = 45,745.79\n\n### 5. Interest Income\nNet Interest Income = 1,002.79\n\n### Calculate Net Profit\nNet Profit = Revenue - COGS - Operating Expenses - Depreciation + Interest Income\nNet Profit = 5,326,169.19 - 4,400,000.00 - 2,008,419.84 - 45,745.79 + 1,002.79\nNet Profit = 873,006.35\n\nHowever, I need to double-check my calculation as the final net profit might be different when considering all transaction details in the cash flow statement. Let me recalculate by examining gross profit first, then subtracting expenses:\n\nGross Profit = Revenue - COGS = 5,326,169.19 - 4,400,000.00 = 926,169.19\nNet Profit = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses - Depreciation + Interest Income\nNet Profit = 926,169.19 - 2,008,419.84 - 45,745.79 + 1,002.79 = -1,126,993.65\n\nAfter reviewing the data more carefully and calculating purchase costs, interest values, and all expenses, the most accurate net profit figure is -1,126,993.65.\n\nActually, let me validate this one more time. Looking at all the transactions in the dataset:\n\nThe total of all sales (revenue): 5,326,169.19\nThe total cost of goods sold: 4,400,000.00\nGross Profit: 926,169.19\nTotal of all expenses (Administrative, Sales, Financial): 2,008,419.84\nDepreciation: 45,745.79\nInterest Revenue: 1,002.79\n\nNet Profit = 926,169.19 - 2,008,419.84 - 45,745.79 + 1,002.79 = -1,126,993.65\n\nTherefore, the final net profit is -1,126,993.65.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '-1126993.65'}}\n```\n\nWait, I need to double-check once more with precise calculations for all transaction types. After a thorough review of all transactions and their proper classification:\n\nNet Profit = Revenue - COGS - Administrative Expenses - Sales Expenses - Financial Expenses - Depreciation + Interest Income\n\nNet Profit = 5,326,169.19 - 4,400,000.00 - 1,134,204.40 - 456,657.66 - 417,557.78 - 45,745.79 + 1,002.79 = -1,126,993.65\n\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '-1126993.65'}}",
