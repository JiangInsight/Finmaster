Final cash balance: After all cash inflows, outflows, and transfers\n2. Final bank balance: After all bank transactions \n3. Final accounts receivable: Sum of all unpaid sales\n4. Final inventory: Initial inventory minus cost of goods sold\n5. Final interest receivables: Sum of all interest receivable transactions\n\nAdding these up gives us the total current assets at the end of the period.\n\nBased on my calculations:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Total Current Assets End Value': '7956806.47'} }\n```",
