The process will involve tracking purchases and sales of products to determine the inventory value.\n\nStep 1: Find the initial inventory value.\nLooking at the transactions at the beginning, I need to check if there's an initial inventory value on 2023-12-31 (the start date).\n\nThe first few transactions are:\n- Initial cash deposit: 3,000,000\n- Initial bank deposit: 5,000,000\n- Initial fixed assets: 5,000,000\n\nI don't see any explicit initial inventory transactions. This suggests the initial inventory value is 0.00.\n\nStep 2: Identify all purchase transactions to add to inventory.\nI'll find all purchase transactions that add products to inventory:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001: Chemical Product C, 16 units × 50,000 = 800,000\n2. Purchase20231231002: Chemical Product D, 30 units × 100,000 = 3,000,000\n3. Purchase20231231003: Chemical Product C, 9 units × 50,000 = 450,000\n4. Purchase20231231004: Chemical Product A, 13 units × 10,000 = 130,000\n5. Purchase20231231005: Chemical Product A, 7 units × 10,000 = 70,000\n6. Purchase20231231006: Chemical Product B, 11 units × 20,000 = 220,000\n7. Purchase20231231007: Chemical Product A, 8 units × 10,000 = 80,000\n8. Purchase20231231008: Chemical Product B, 19 units × 20,000 = 380,000\n9. Purchase20231231009: Chemical Product A, 22 units × 10,000 = 220,000\n10. Purchase20231231010: Chemical Product D, 15 units × 100,000 = 1,500,000\n11. Purchase20231231011: Chemical Product C, 18 units × 50,000 = 900,000\n12. Purchase20231231012: Chemical Product B, 19 units × 20,000 = 380,000\n13. Purchase20231231013: Chemical Product D, 21 units × 100,000 = 2,100,000\n\nTotal purchases: 10,230,000\n\nStep 3: Identify all sales transactions to subtract from inventory.\nNow I need to calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS) to subtract from inventory:\n\nChemical Product A sales:\n- 2024-01-06: 3 units × 10,000 = 30,000\n- 2024-01-07: 2 units × 10,000 = 20,000\n- 2024-01-09: 4 units × 10,000 = 40,000\n- 2024-01-09: 4 units × 10,000 = 40,000\n- 2024-01-13: 3 units × 10,000 = 30,000\n- 2024-01-13: 5 units × 10,000 = 50,000\n- 2024-01-14: 1 unit × 10,000 = 10,000\n- 2024-01-16: 2 units × 10,000 = 20,000\n- 2024-01-21: 1 unit × 10,000 = 10,000\n- 2024-01-22: 2 units × 10,000 = 20,000\n- 2024-01-24: 4 units × 10,000 = 40,000\n- 2024-01-25: 2 units × 10,000 = 20,000\n- 2024-01-26: 5 units × 10,000 = 50,000\n- 2024-01-28: 4 units × 10,000 = 40,000\n- 2024-01-28: 1 unit × 10,000 = 10,000\nTotal: 430,000\n\nChemical Product B sales:\n- 2024-01-10: 3 units × 20,000 = 60,000\n- 2024-01-17: 1 unit × 20,000 = 20,000\n- 2024-01-18: 1 unit × 20,000 = 20,000\n- 2024-01-19: 2 units × 20,000 = 40,000\n- 2024-01-20: 2 units × 20,000 = 40,000\n- 2024-01-21: 5 units × 20,000 = 100,000\n- 2024-01-22: 2 units × 20,000 = 40,000\n- 2024-01-24: 4 units × 20,000 = 80,000\n- 2024-01-27: 2 units × 20,000 = 40,000\nTotal: 440,000\n\nChemical Product C sales:\n- 2024-01-02: 1 unit × 50,000 = 50,000\n- 2024-01-04: 4 units × 50,000 = 200,000\n- 2024-01-05: 1 unit × 50,000 = 50,000\n- 2024-01-05: 2 units × 50,000 = 100,000\n- 2024-01-11: 3 units × 50,000 = 150,000\n- 2024-01-15: 1 unit × 50,000 = 50,000\n- 2024-01-16: 3 units × 50,000 = 150,000\n- 2024-01-23: 2 units × 50,000 = 100,000\nTotal: 850,000\n\nChemical Product D sales:\n- 2024-01-03: 1 unit × 100,000 = 100,000\n- 2024-01-03: 2 units × 100,000 = 200,000\n- 2024-01-04: 4 units × 100,000 = 400,000\n- 2024-01-07: 2 units × 100,000 = 200,000\n- 2024-01-08: 3 units × 100,000 = 300,000\n- 2024-01-08: 5 units × 100,000 = 500,000\n- 2024-01-12: 2 units × 100,000 = 200,000\n- 2024-01-12: 1 unit × 100,000 = 100,000\n- 2024-01-14: 2 units × 100,000 = 200,000\n- 2024-01-19: 3 units × 100,000 = 300,000\n- 2024-01-23: 3 units × 100,000 = 300,000\n- 2024-01-25: 1 unit × 100,000 = 100,000\n- 2024-01-29: 1 unit × 100,000 = 100,000\nTotal: 3,000,000\n\nTotal sales cost (COGS): 430,000 + 440,000 + 850,000 + 3,000,000 = 4,720,000\n\nStep 4: Calculate the ending inventory value.\nInitial inventory value: 0.00\n+ Total purchases: 10,230,000\n- Total COGS: 4,720,000\n= Ending inventory value: 5,510,000\n\nHowever, I need to double-check my calculations. Let me verify the product units:\n\nProduct A:\n- Purchased: 13 + 7 + 8 + 22 = 50 units\n- Sold: 3 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 43 units\n- Remaining: 7 units × 10,000 = 70,000\n\nProduct B:\n- Purchased: 11 + 19 + 19 = 49 units\n- Sold: 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 22 units\n- Remaining: 27 units × 20,000 = 540,000\n\nProduct C:\n- Purchased: 16 + 9 + 18 = 43 units\n- Sold: 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 17 units\n- Remaining: 26 units × 50,000 = 1,300,000\n\nProduct D:\n- Purchased: 30 + 15 + 21 = 66 units\n- Sold: 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 30 units\n- Remaining: 36 units × 100,000 = 3,600,000\n\nRecalculated ending inventory: 70,000 + 540,000 + 1,300,000 + 3,600,000 = 5,510,000\n\nUpon further review of the data, I noticed some inventory items were purchased on 12/31/2023, which would be part of the initial inventory. Since all purchase transactions with the date 2023-12-31 should be considered part of the initial inventory, the initial value should be the sum of all these purchases, which is 10,230,000.\n\nHowever, I notice a slight discrepancy in my calculation compared to the expected format from the example. The ending inventory should be calculated by taking initial inventory (all purchases on 12/31/2023) minus COGS from sales, which gives us 10,230,000 - 4,720,000 = 5,510,000. But since we're considering all 12/31/2023 purchases as initial inventory, I think the proper way to calculate would be:\n\nInitial inventory value (as of 12/31/2023): 10,230,000\n- Sales COGS (in January): 4,720,000\n= Ending inventory value (as of 01/29/2024): 5,510,000\n\nHowever, a closer look at the example solution shows \"Initial Value: 0.00\", which indicates we should treat the initial inventory as zero and consider the December 31st purchases as additions to inventory, not as initial inventory.\n\nTo match the format of the example, I'll go with:\n\nInitial Inventory Value: 0.00\nEnding Inventory Value: 5,510,000\n\nLet me double-check the ending inventory value one more time:\n- Product A: 7 units × 10,000 = 70,000\n- Product B: 27 units × 20,000 = 540,000\n- Product C: 26 units × 50,000 = 1,300,000\n- Product D: 36 units × 100,000 = 3,600,000\nTotal: 5,510,000\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Initial Value': '0.00', 'Inventory End Value': '5510000.00'}}\n```",
