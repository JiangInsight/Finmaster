This is the only transaction that would be considered in the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" line item in the cash flow statement.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the final purchase of fixed assets\nSince there is only one fixed assets purchase transaction with an amount of 480116.37, this is the total amount for Purchase of Fixed Assets.\n\nTherefore, the final purchase of fixed assets in the cash flow statement is 480116.37.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '480116.37'} }\n```",
