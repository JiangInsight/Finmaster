                        "content": "I need to calculate the property, plant and non-current assets for the balance sheet, both initial and final values. Let me analyze the transactions.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the initial non-current assets\nLooking at the transactions, I can see the initial fixed assets:\n```\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n```\n\nThis shows the company had 5,000,000 in fixed assets at the beginning.\n\n## Step 2: Identify any additions to fixed assets\nI need to look for any fixed asset purchases during the period:\n```\n| FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 480116.37 | 480116.37 |  |  | Paid | Bank Transfer |  | S001 | Supplier 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Chemical Production Line4 | Chemical Production Line |\n```\n\nThis shows a fixed asset purchase of 480,116.37 for a chemical production line.\n\n## Step 3: Identify any depreciation\nI need to look for depreciation entries:\n```\n| Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45745.79 | 45745.79 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n```\n\nThis shows depreciation of 45,745.79 during the period.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the ending non-current assets value\nThe calculation would be:\n- Initial value: 5,000,000.00\n- Plus additions: 480,116.37\n- Less depreciation: 45,745.79\n\nTherefore:\nFinal non-current assets = 5,000,000.00 + 480,116.37 - 45,745.79 = 5,434,370.58\n\nHowever, I notice there might be an error in my calculation as the final value doesn't match what would be expected. Let me double-check the transactions again.\n\nActually, it seems the fixed asset purchase happened on the same day as the initial fixed assets entry (2023-12-31). Since both are dated on the same day, it's possible that the 5,000,000 already includes the 480,116.37 purchase. Let me reconsider the calculation:\n\nIf the initial 5,000,000 already includes the fixed asset purchase, then:\nFinal non-current assets = 5,000,000.00 - 45,745.79 = 4,954,254.21\n\nBut if they are separate transactions and the fixed asset purchase represents an addition after the initial recording, then:\nFinal non-current assets = 5,000,000.00 + 480,116.37 - 45,745.79 = 5,434,370.58\n\nSince the fixed asset purchase is recorded as a separate transaction with its own ID (FixedAsset20231231001), I believe it's an addition to the initial fixed assets. Therefore, the ending value would be 5,434,370.58.\n\nGiven the information, I'll provide the most accurate calculation:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '5434370.58'} }\n```",
