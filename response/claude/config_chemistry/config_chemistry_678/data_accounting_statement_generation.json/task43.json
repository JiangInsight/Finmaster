Initial deposits (not part of operating activities):\n```\n3000000.0 (Cash deposit) + 5000000.0 (Bank deposit) + 5000000.0 (Fixed Assets)\n```\nThese are initial investments and not part of operating cash flow.\n\n5. Fixed Asset Purchase (not part of operating activities):\n```\n480116.37\n```\nThis is an investing activity, not operating.\n\n6. Cash to bank or bank to cash transfers (not operating activities):\n```\nMultiple 100000.0 entries marked as transfers\n```\nThese are internal transfers and don't affect net cash flow.\n\n7. Interest Receivables (non-cash until received):\n```\nAll interest receivables have \"Unpaid\" status so they don't affect cash flow.\n```\n\n### Net Cash Flow Calculation:\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = Cash Inflows - Cash Outflows\n= 3,744,996.50 - (2,037,754.33 + 9,780,000.00)\n= 3,744,996.50 - 11,817,754.33\n= -8,072,757.83\n\nRounding to the nearest 2 decimal places: -8,072,757.83\n\nHowever, I notice that the transactions also include depreciation of 45,745.79 which is a non-cash expense that needs to be added back to get the correct operating cash flow:\n\n-8,072,757.83 + 45,745.79 = -8,027,012.04\n\nActually, let me double-check the inclusion of initial deposits and Cash to bank transfers. Since we're only looking at operating activities, initial deposits should be excluded. Transfers between cash and bank accounts are internal movements and don't affect the total cash flow from operations.\n\nAfter careful review, I confirm that the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is:\n-8,027,012.04\n\nLet me round to 2 decimal places:\n-8,027,012.04\n\nActually, I see that the example solution is formatted differently. Let me provide the solution in the exact format requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities': '-8027012.04'} }\n```",
