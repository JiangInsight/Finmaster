Let me analyze the transactions data to find both the initial and final accumulated depreciation amounts.\n\n## Step 1: Identify depreciation transactions\nFirst, I'll look for any transactions with the type \"Depreciation\" in the dataset.\n\nLooking through the data, I can see one depreciation transaction:\n- Transaction ID: Depreciation20240101001\n- Type: Depreciation\n- Date: 2024-01-01\n- Amount: 45745.79\n\n## Step 2: Determine the initial accumulated depreciation\nIn a typical balance sheet, accumulated depreciation represents the cumulative depreciation over time. Since this appears to be the first depreciation entry (dated January 1, 2024), and there are no other depreciation entries or initial accumulated depreciation values explicitly mentioned, I can reasonably conclude that the initial accumulated depreciation as of December 31, 2023 was 0.00.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the final accumulated depreciation\nThe final accumulated depreciation would be the initial value plus any depreciation amounts recorded during the period. Since we have only one depreciation entry of 45745.79, the final accumulated depreciation would be:\n\nInitial value (0.00) + Depreciation amount (45745.79) = 45745.79\n\n## Step 4: Format the answer\nNow I'll format the answer as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accumulated Depreciation End Value': '45745.79'} }\n```",
