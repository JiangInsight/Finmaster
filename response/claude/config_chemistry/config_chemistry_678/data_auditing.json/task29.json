The recorded tax is even higher than the total amount mentioned in the invoice, which is logically impossible.\n\nThe other values in the transaction also don't match what's stated in the invoice, and the invoice information appears more consistent (the total amount of 441383.00 makes sense given the unit price of 110345.75 Ã— 4 units).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-04', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-26', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '110345.75', 'Recorded price': '108614.40', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '441383.00', 'Recorded amount': '475717.43', 'Original tax': '22069.15', 'Recorded tax': '467287.20', 'Original profit': '41383.00', 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240104006'} }\n```",
