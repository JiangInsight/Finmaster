Looking at the recorded_type, it shows \"Administrative Expenses\" but the ID begins with \"Interest\" and the invoice description mentions \"Interest Receivables\".\n\n2. The recorded_date is \"2024-02-03\" but the invoice states it was issued on \"January 10, 2024\".\n\n3. The recorded_amount is \"-20.69\" but the invoice description states \"totaling $-18.69\".\n\nLet me verify this against the standard pattern for Interest transactions in the data, which should have \"Interest Receivables\" as the type, a date matching the invoice date, and an amount matching what's in the invoice description.\n\nThis transaction clearly has inconsistencies in the category (type), date, and amount fields when compared to the invoice description, which is generally considered more reliable.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Interest Receivables', 'Recorded category': 'Administrative Expenses', 'Original date': '2024-01-10', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-03', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '-18.69', 'Recorded amount': '-20.69', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Interest20240110010'} }\n```",
