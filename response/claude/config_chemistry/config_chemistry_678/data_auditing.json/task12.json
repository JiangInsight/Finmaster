Since the invoice is considered more reliable, this is clearly an error in the recorded field.\n\nThe transaction shows:\n- ID: Expense20240104001\n- Type: Financial Expenses \n- Recorded approver: (empty)\n- Invoice text: \"This transaction was prepared by Senior Manager, and the approver is Director.\"\n\nSince the recorded_approver field is empty but should be \"Director\" according to the invoice, this is an inconsistency that needs to be corrected.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': 'Director', 'Recorded Approver': 'None', 'id': 'Expense20240104001'} }\n```",
