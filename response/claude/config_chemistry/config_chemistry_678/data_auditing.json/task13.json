First, I notice that the recorded_type is \"Sales Expenses\" but the ID starts with \"Sale\" and the invoice describes it as a sale transaction.\n2. Looking at the invoice: \"On January 11, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 3.0 units at a unit price of $63307.87, totaling $189923.61.\"\n3. The tax amount is recorded as $209099.87, which is unusually high - much higher than the total amount itself ($189923.61).\n4. Calculating the correct tax: The invoice mentions a total amount due of $180427.43, which suggests the tax should be $189923.61 - $180427.43 = $9496.18.\n5. This confirms the recorded tax amount of $209099.87 is incorrect, and the correct value should be $9496.18.\n6. The recorded_type is \"Sales Expenses\" but should be \"Sale\" based on the invoice and transaction ID.\n\nTherefore, this transaction has two inconsistencies:\n- Incorrect transaction type (recorded as \"Sales Expenses\" instead of \"Sale\")\n- Incorrect tax amount (recorded as $209099.87 instead of $9496.18)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': '9496.18', 'Recorded tax': '209099.87', 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240111021'} }\n```",
