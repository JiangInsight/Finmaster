The recorded_type is \"Administrative Expenses\" but the ID starts with \"Sale\" and the invoice describes it as a Sale\n2. The recorded_amount is $24,242.98, but the invoice indicates a total of $22,983.06\n3. The recorded_tax_amount is $20,621.24, which is extremely high compared to the standard 5% tax rate shown in other transactions\n4. The recorded_unit_price ($23,156.14) doesn't match what's in the invoice ($22,983.06)\n\nBased on the invoice text: \"On January 18, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $22983.06, totaling $22983.06. The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $1149.15, leading to a total amount due of $21833.91. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nThis clearly shows multiple discrepancies between the recorded data and what's in the invoice.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"22983.06\", \"Recorded price\": \"23156.14\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"22983.06\", \"Recorded amount\": \"24242.98\", \"Original tax\": \"1149.15\", \"Recorded tax\": \"20621.24\", \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240118038\"}}\n```",
