Based on the invoice text, this transaction should be a Sale from January 15, 2024, consisting of 1.0 unit at $61,647.27, totaling $61,647.27, with a tax amount of $3,082.36.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original date': '2024-01-15', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-22', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '1.0', 'Recorded quantity': '1.0', 'Original price': '61647.27', 'Recorded price': '68534.62', 'Original receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Original amount': '61647.27', 'Recorded amount': '73724.78', 'Original tax': '3082.36', 'Recorded tax': '67168.44', 'Original profit': '11647.27', 'Recorded profit': '11647.27', 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240115032'} }\n```",
