The recorded_type is \"Purchase\" but the transaction ID starts with \"Sale\"\n2. The invoice states it's a \"Sale\" transaction\n3. Looking at the recorded_quantity (3.0) vs. what's in the invoice description (4.0 units)\n4. The recorded_amount is $39,180.00, but the invoice mentions $52,240.00\n5. The risk_issues field confirms these inconsistencies\n\nLet me check the calculations:\n- Invoice states: 4.0 units at $13,060.00 per unit = $52,240.00\n- But recorded amount is $39,180.00, which would be 3.0 units at $13,060.00\n\nThe inconsistencies are:\n1. Transaction type (recorded as Purchase instead of Sale)\n2. Quantity (recorded as 3 instead of 4)\n3. Total amount (recorded as $39,180.00 instead of $52,240.00)\n\nSince the invoice is considered more reliable, the correct values should be:\n- Type: Sale (not Purchase)\n- Quantity: 4.0 (not 3.0)\n- Amount: $52,240.00 (not $39,180.00)\n\nThis matches the risk_issues field which identifies the same problems.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Purchase', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '4.0', 'Recorded quantity': '3.0', 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '52240.00', 'Recorded amount': '39180.0', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240109017'} }\n```",
