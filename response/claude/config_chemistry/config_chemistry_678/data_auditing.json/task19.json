For entry with ID \"Interest20240106006\":\n   - The recorded_type is \"Depreciation\" but the invoice clearly states it's an \"Interest Receivables\" transaction\n   - The recorded_date is \"2024-01-13\" but the invoice states it occurred on \"January 06, 2024\"\n   - The receive_method and payment status are consistent with an Interest Receivables transaction\n\n2. For entry with ID \"Purchase20231231001\":\n   - The recorded_amount is \"800000.0\" which matches the invoice calculation (16.0 units at $50000.0 each)\n   - No inconsistency found in this entry\n\nI need to go through all entries to identify any other inconsistencies, comparing the structured fields with the invoice details which serve as the source of truth.\n\nBased on my analysis, I've found that the entry \"Interest20240106006\" contains two clear inconsistencies: an incorrect transaction type and date.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Interest Receivables\", \"Recorded category\": \"Depreciation\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-06\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-13\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Interest20240106006\"}}\n```",
