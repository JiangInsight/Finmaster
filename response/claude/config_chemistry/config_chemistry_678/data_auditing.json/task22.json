I need to identify transactions with internal inconsistencies\n2. The invoice field is considered more reliable due to its standardized nature\n3. For each inconsistency, I need to identify the transaction ID, incorrect fields, and estimate correct values\n\nLet me analyze this transaction data:\n\nLooking at transaction `Purchase20231231001`:\n- The recorded_amount is 800000.0\n- The invoice says \"16.0 units at a unit price of $50000.00, totaling $800000.00\"\n- 16 Ã— 50000 = 800000, so this is consistent\n\nFor transaction `Sale20240106012`:\n- The recorded_date is 2024-02-04\n- But the invoice says \"On January 06, 2024\"\n- Also, the recorded_unit_price is 12984.59\n- But the invoice mentions \"a unit price of $12976.92\"\n- This is an inconsistency - the date and unit price don't match the invoice\n\nGoing through other transactions, I notice that for most transactions, the calculated values match, but the example shows that we should be looking for discrepancies between what's recorded and what's in the invoice.\n\nLet me check:\n- The transaction ID is `Sale20240106012`\n- The incorrect fields are recorded_date (2024-02-04 vs. 2024-01-06) and recorded_unit_price (12984.59 vs. 12976.92)\n- The correct values based on the invoice are 2024-01-06 for the date and 12976.92 for the unit price\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-06', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-04', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '12976.92', 'Recorded price': '12984.59', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240106012'} }",
