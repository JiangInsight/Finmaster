The ID is \"Sale20240126056\" but the recorded_type is \"Purchase\" - this is inconsistent.\n2. Invoice states it's a Sale but record shows Purchase.\n3. The date in the ID (20240126) indicates January 26, 2024, but the recorded_date is February 20, 2024.\n4. The invoice describes 5.0 units, but recorded_quantity shows only 3.0.\n5. The unit price in the invoice is $12,770.69, but recorded_unit_price is $14,541.26.\n6. The total amount in the invoice is $63,853.45, but the recorded_amount is $38,312.07.\n\nLet me verify these calculations:\n- From invoice: 5.0 units × $12,770.69 = $63,853.45 ✓\n- From recorded: 3.0 units × $14,541.26 = $43,623.78 (which doesn't match recorded_amount of $38,312.07) ✗\n\nThe invoice also mentions:\n- Cost amount: $50,000.00\n- Tax amount: $3,192.67\n- Total amount due: $60,660.78\n- Profit: $13,853.45\n\nThe recorded information appears to be inaccurate on multiple fields compared to what's stated in the invoice, which is generally considered more reliable.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Purchase', 'Original date': '2024-01-26', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-20', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '5.0', 'Recorded quantity': '3.0', 'Original price': '12770.69', 'Recorded price': '14541.26', 'Original receive_method': 'Cash', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Cash', 'Original amount': '63853.45', 'Recorded amount': '38312.07', 'Original tax': '3192.67', 'Recorded tax': '3192.67', 'Original profit': '13853.45', 'Recorded profit': '13853.45', 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240126056'} }",
