Let me look at each row to find potential issues.\n\nLooking at the data, I notice that most entries appear consistent. The key is to cross-reference information within each row to identify discrepancies.\n\nI'm paying special attention to the invoice field, which is considered more reliable since it's standardized and regulated.
