The Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated by dividing total liabilities by total assets.\n\nStep 1: Identify the total liabilities at the end of the reporting period.\nFrom the balance sheet, the Total Current Liabilities is $737,762.05. There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so the total liabilities is $737,762.05.\n\nStep 2: Identify the total assets at the end of the reporting period.\nFrom the balance sheet, the Total Assets is $12,385,382.42.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio.\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $737,762.05 / $12,385,382.42\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 0.059567...\n\nStep 4: Round to 2 decimal places.\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 0.06\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06'}}\n```",
