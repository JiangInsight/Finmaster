The formula is:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = $737,762.05 (Total Current Liabilities)\n- Total Assets = $12,385,382.42\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $737,762.05 / $12,385,382.42 = 0.0596 â‰ˆ 0.06\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operations to the reported net income. The formula is:\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit\n\nFrom the cash flow statement and income statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$7,724,112.71\n- Net Profit = -$1,352,379.63\n\nSince both values are negative, I'll use their absolute values for a meaningful ratio.\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = |-$7,724,112.71| / |-$1,352,379.63| = $7,724,112.71 / $1,352,379.63 = 5.71\n\n## Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.06\", \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"5.71\"}}\n```",
