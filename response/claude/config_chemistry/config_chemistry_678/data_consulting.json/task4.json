Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $737,762.05\n   (Since there are no non-current liabilities shown)\n\n2. Total Owner's Equity = $11,647,620.37\n\nNow I can calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $737,762.05 / $11,647,620.37 = 0.063341...\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 0.06\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06'}}\n```",
