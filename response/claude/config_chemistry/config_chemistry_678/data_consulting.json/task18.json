Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: From the cash flow statement, this is -7,724,112.71\n2. Total Current Liabilities: From the balance sheet (end date), this is 737,762.05\n\nNow I'll calculate the ratio:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -7,724,112.71 / 737,762.05 = -10.47\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: -10.47\n\nTherefore, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is -10.47.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-10.47'}}\n```",
