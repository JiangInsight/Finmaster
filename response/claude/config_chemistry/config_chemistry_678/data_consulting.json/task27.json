Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nThis ratio compares the net cash flow from operating activities to the net income.\n\nOperating Cash Flow: -$7,724,112.71\nNet Income: -$1,352,379.63\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = -$7,724,112.71 รท -$1,352,379.63 = 5.71\n\n## 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio (also known as Total Asset Turnover)\n\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n\nTotal Revenue: $5,755,241.17\nAverage Current Assets: ($8,000,000.00 + $6,951,011.84) รท 2 = $7,475,505.92\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = $5,755,241.17 รท $7,475,505.92 = 0.77\n\n## 3. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n\nThe quick ratio measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n\nQuick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory\nQuick Assets = $6,951,011.84 - $5,550,000.00 = $1,401,011.84\n\nCurrent Liabilities = $737,762.05\n\nQuick Ratio = $1,401,011.84 รท $737,762.05 = 1.90\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '5.71', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.77', 'Quick Ratio': '1.90'}}\n```",
