                        "content": "I'll calculate each of the requested financial ratios step by step using the provided financial statements.\n\n## 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio shows how efficiently a company collects credit sales from customers.\n\nFormula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n- Net Credit Sales = Main Business Revenue = $5,755,241.17\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning + Ending)/2 = (0 + $1,604,015.21)/2 = $802,007.61\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $5,755,241.17 / $802,007.61 = 7.18\n\n## 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay off short-term liabilities with cash generated from operations.\n\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\n- Operating Cash Flow = -$7,724,112.71\n- Current Liabilities = $737,762.05\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$7,724,112.71 / $737,762.05 = -10.47\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio, measuring how well cash flow covers current liabilities.\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -$7,724,112.71 / $737,762.05 = -10.47\n\n## 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n\nFormula: Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\n- Net Sales = $5,755,241.17\n- Average Total Assets = (Beginning + Ending)/2 = ($13,000,000 + $12,385,382.42)/2 = $12,692,691.21\n\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = $5,755,241.17 / $12,692,691.21 = 0.45\n\n## 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis shows the proportion of a company's financing from debt versus shareholders' equity.\n\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities = $737,762.05\n- Total Equity = $11,647,620.37\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $737,762.05 / $11,647,620.37 = 0.06\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.18', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-10.47', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-10.47', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.45', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06'} }\n```",
