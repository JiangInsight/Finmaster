From the Balance Sheet (End amounts):\n   - Total Current Assets = $6,951,011.84\n   - Inventory = $5,550,000.00\n   - Total Current Liabilities = $737,762.05\n   - Total Assets = $12,385,382.42\n   - Total Liabilities = $737,762.05 (only current liabilities shown)\n   - Total Owner's Equity = $11,647,620.37\n\n2. From the Cash Flow Statement:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$7,724,112.71\n\nNow I'll calculate each ratio:\n\n**1. Current Ratio**\nCurrent Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\nCurrent Ratio = $6,951,011.84 / $737,762.05 = 9.42\n\n**2. Quick Ratio**\nQuick Ratio = (Total Current Assets - Inventory) / Total Current Liabilities\nQuick Ratio = ($6,951,011.84 - $5,550,000.00) / $737,762.05 = $1,401,011.84 / $737,762.05 = 1.90\n\n**3. Debt to Asset Ratio**\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $737,762.05 / $12,385,382.42 = 0.06\n\n**4. Debt to Equity Ratio**\nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $737,762.05 / $11,647,620.37 = 0.06\n\n**5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Liabilities\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -$7,724,112.71 / $737,762.05 = -10.47\n\nRounding all values to 2 decimal places:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '9.42', 'Quick Ratio': '1.90', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-10.47'}}\n```",
