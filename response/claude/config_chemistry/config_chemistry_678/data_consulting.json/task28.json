Debt to Asset Ratio\nThe debt to asset ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt.\n\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = $737,762.05\n- Total Assets = $12,385,382.42\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $737,762.05 / $12,385,382.42 = 0.0596 ≈ 0.06\n\n## 2. Gross Profit Margin\nThe gross profit margin shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold.\n\nFormula: (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = $1,075,241.17\n- Total Revenue = $5,755,241.17\n\nGross Profit Margin = ($1,075,241.17 / $5,755,241.17) × 100% = 18.68% ≈ 18.7%\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThe operating cash flow ratio measures a company's ability to pay off its short-term liabilities with the cash generated from operations.\n\nFormula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$7,724,112.71\n- Total Current Liabilities = $737,762.05\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$7,724,112.71 / $737,762.05 = -10.47 ≈ -10.5\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Gross Profit Margin': '18.7%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-10.5'}}\n```",
