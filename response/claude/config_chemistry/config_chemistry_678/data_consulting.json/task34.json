                        "content": "I'll solve this task by calculating each financial ratio step by step.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with cash generated from operations.\n- Operating Cash Flow = -7,724,112.71 (from cash flow statement)\n- Current Liabilities = 737,762.05 (from balance sheet)\n- Ratio = -7,724,112.71 / 737,762.05 = -10.47\n\n## 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's financial leverage.\n- Total Liabilities = 737,762.05 (from balance sheet)\n- Total Equity = 11,647,620.37 (from balance sheet)\n- Ratio = 737,762.05 / 11,647,620.37 = 0.06\n\n## 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n- Revenue = 5,755,241.17 (from income statement)\n- Total Assets = 12,385,382.42 (from balance sheet)\n- Ratio = 5,755,241.17 / 12,385,382.42 = 0.46\n\n## 4. Quick Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n- Quick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 6,951,011.84 - 5,550,000.00 = 1,401,011.84\n- Current Liabilities = 737,762.05\n- Ratio = 1,401,011.84 / 737,762.05 = 1.90\n\n## 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow generated from operations.\n- Operating Cash Flow = -7,724,112.71\n- Current Liabilities = 737,762.05\n- Ratio = -7,724,112.71 / 737,762.05 = -10.47\n(This is the same as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio)\n\n## 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\nThis ratio measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholders' equity.\n- Net Profit = -1,352,379.63 (from income statement)\n- Shareholders' Equity = 11,647,620.37 (from balance sheet)\n- ROE = (-1,352,379.63 / 11,647,620.37) Ã— 100% = -11.61%\n\n## 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company collects revenue from customers.\n- Revenue = 5,755,241.17 (from income statement)\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 1,604,015.21) / 2 = 802,007.61\n- Ratio = 5,755,241.17 / 802,007.61 = 7.18\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-10.47', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.46', 'Quick Ratio': '1.90', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-10.47', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '-11.61%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.18'} }\n```",
