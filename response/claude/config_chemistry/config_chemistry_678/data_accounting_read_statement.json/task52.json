In financial statements, this is typically represented as \"Paid-in Capital\", \"Share Capital\", \"Common Stock\", or similar terminology.\n\nFrom the balance sheet provided, I can see the following relevant line item:\n- \"Paid-in Capital\" with an initial amount of 13000000.00 on 2023-12-31 and an end amount of 13000000.00 on 2024-01-29\n\nThis represents the capital that shareholders have contributed to the company in exchange for shares. Since this value remained unchanged during the period, the company did not issue new shares or receive additional capital contributions.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
