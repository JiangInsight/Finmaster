In a typical balance sheet, this would be shown as \"Taxes Payable\" or a similar account.\n\nExamining the provided balance sheet, I can see there is a line item called \"Taxes Payable\" which represents tax that has been accrued but not yet paid.\n\nFor this account:\n- The initial value as of 2023-12-31 is 0.00\n- The end value as of 2024-01-29 is 287762.05\n\nTherefore, the tax accrued but not yet paid has an initial value of 0.00 and an end value of 287762.05.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '287762.05'} }\n```",
