Total income arising in the course of an entity's ordinary activities - This would be the \"Total Revenue\"\n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period - This would be the \"Cost of Goods Sold\"\n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole - This would be the \"Administrative Expenses\"\n\nLooking at the income statement provided:\n- Total Revenue = 5755241.17\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 4680000.00\n- Administrative Expenses = 1082287.97\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5755241.17', 'value2': '4680000.00', 'value3': '1082287.97'}}\n```",
