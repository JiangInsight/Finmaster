Cash on Hand: Initial amount of 3,000,000.00 (2023-12-31) and end amount of -206,636.07 (2024-01-29)\n2. Bank Deposits: Initial amount of 5,000,000.00 (2023-12-31) and end amount of 2,406.99 (2024-01-29)\n\nBoth of these accounts represent cash available for day-to-day operations. For the solution, I need to determine which one to use or if I should combine them.\n\nSince the task asks for \"cash held by an entity that is available for use in its day-to-day operations,\" I should include both Cash on Hand and Bank Deposits, as both represent liquid cash resources.\n\nThe initial value would be the sum of both initial amounts:\n3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 8,000,000.00\n\nThe end value would be the sum of both end amounts:\n-206,636.07 + 2,406.99 = -204,229.08\n\nHowever, looking at the example solution provided, it appears that only \"Cash on Hand\" was considered for the solution, not the combined total with Bank Deposits. Following this precedent from the example:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '3000000.00', 'end value': '-206636.07'}}\n```",
