This is exactly what we're looking for in this task.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- The initial amount for \"Interest Receivable\" as of 2023-12-31 is 0.00\n- The end amount for \"Interest Receivable\" as of 2024-01-29 is 1225.71\n\nTherefore, the accrued interest not yet received had an initial value of 0.00 and an end value of 1225.71.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1225.71'}}\n```",
