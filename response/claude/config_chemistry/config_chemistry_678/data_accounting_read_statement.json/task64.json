Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense (from the Income Statement)\n2. Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit (from the Balance Sheet)\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares (from the Balance Sheet)\n\nLet me analyze each statement:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- \"Accounts Payable\" with end amount of \"450000.00\" represents the amount owed by the entity for goods/services\n- \"Paid-in Capital\" with end amount of \"13000000.00\" represents capital contributed by shareholders\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- \"Profit Before Tax\" with amount of \"-1064617.58\" represents profit/loss before tax expense\n\nTherefore:\n- value1 = Paid-in Capital = 13000000.00\n- value2 = Profit Before Tax = -1064617.58\n- value3 = Accounts Payable = 450000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '-1064617.58', 'value3': '450000.00'}}\n```",
