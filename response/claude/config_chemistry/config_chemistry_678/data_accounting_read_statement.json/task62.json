Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit = Accounts Receivable (from Balance Sheet)\n2. Financing costs incurred by the enterprise = Financial Expenses (from Income Statement)\n3. Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment = Purchase of Fixed Assets (from Cash Flow Statement)\n\nLet me analyze each statement to find these values:\n\n1. From the Balance Sheet:\n   - Accounts Receivable: $1,604,015.21 (End_amount)\n\n2. From the Income Statement:\n   - Financial Expenses: $549,407.19\n\n3. From the Cash Flow Statement:\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: $480,116.37\n\nThese are the three required values in the specified order.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1604015.21', 'value2': '549407.19', 'value3': '480116.37'} }\n```",
