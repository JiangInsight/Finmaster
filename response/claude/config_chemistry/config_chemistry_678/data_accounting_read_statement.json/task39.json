However, the task is asking for the reduction in assets held for sale, which would be a decrease in inventory.\n\nSince the value is negative, indicating an increase rather than a reduction, the answer represents the change in inventory but needs to be understood as an increase. The actual value of the change in inventory from the statement is \"-5550000.00\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-5550000.00'}}\n```",
