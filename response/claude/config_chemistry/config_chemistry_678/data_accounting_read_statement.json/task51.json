In the balance sheet, I notice \"Interest Receivable\" which represents accrued interest that hasn't been received yet:\n   - Initial amount: 0.00 (on 2023-12-31)\n   - End amount: 1225.71 (on 2024-01-29)\n\n2. In the cash flow statement, I see \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" with an amount of -1225.71, confirming this is interest that has accrued but hasn't been received in cash.\n\n3. In the income statement, \"Interest Income\" shows 1225.71, which matches the interest receivable amount.\n\nThis confirms that \"Interest Receivable\" is the correct line item representing interest accrued but not yet received, with an initial value of 0.00 and an end value of 1225.71.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"1225.71\"}}\n```",
