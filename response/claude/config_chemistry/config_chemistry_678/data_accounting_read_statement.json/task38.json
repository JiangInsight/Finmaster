Accounts receivable represents money owed to the company by customers who purchased goods or services on credit.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement, I can see:\n- \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable: -1604015.21\"\n\nThe negative sign indicates an increase in accounts receivable (more money is owed to the company). This is shown as a negative in the cash flow statement because an increase in accounts receivable uses cash (the company has provided goods/services but hasn't received payment yet).\n\nTherefore, the value representing the increase in amounts owed to the entity (or decrease in cash due to accounts receivable) is -1604015.21.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1604015.21'}}\n```",
