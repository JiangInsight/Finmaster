These are typically classified as current assets.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet provided in the problem:\n\n1. The line item \"Total Current Assets\" represents assets that are expected to be realized within the operating cycle.\n\n2. The initial value of Total Current Assets as of 2023-12-31 is 8000000.00\n\n3. The end value of Total Current Assets as of 2024-01-29 is 6951011.84\n\nTherefore, these are the values I need to extract for my solution.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '6951011.84'}}\n```",
