January 1: 32,963.21\n2. January 2: 39,636.71 + 46,809.94 = 86,446.65\n3. January 4: 38,768.59\n4. January 6: 37,429.99\n5. January 7: 20,581.68\n6. January 8: 17,423.33\n7. January 14: 36,256.39\n8. January 15: 26,422.97\n9. January 16: 7,210.97 + 8,529.70 = 15,740.67\n10. January 19: 30,499.76\n11. January 22: 7,410.37\n12. January 23: 9,590.47\n13. January 27: 8,766.09\n\nNow I'll sum up all these values:\n32,963.21 + 86,446.65 + 38,768.59 + 37,429.99 + 20,581.68 + 17,423.33 + 36,256.39 + 26,422.97 + 15,740.67 + 30,499.76 + 7,410.37 + 9,590.47 + 8,766.09 = 368,300.17\n\nLet me double-check this by reviewing the dataset again to make sure I didn't miss any sales expenses entries.\n\nI notice I may have missed some entries. Let me go through the dataset more carefully and list all \"Sales Expenses\" transactions by date:\n\n- Jan 1: 32,963.21\n- Jan 2: 39,636.71 + 46,809.94 = 86,446.65\n- Jan 4: 38,768.59\n- Jan 6: 37,429.99\n- Jan 7: 20,581.68\n- Jan 8: 17,423.33\n- Jan 13: 27,093.82\n- Jan 14: 36,256.39\n- Jan 15: 26,422.97\n- Jan 16: 7,210.97 + 8,529.70 = 15,740.67\n- Jan 19: 30,499.76\n- Jan 22: 7,410.37\n- Jan 23: 9,590.47\n- Jan 27: 8,766.09\n\nAdding all these values:\n32,963.21 + 86,446.65 + 38,768.59 + 37,429.99 + 20,581.68 + 17,423.33 + 27,093.82 + 36,256.39 + 26,422.97 + 15,740.67 + 30,499.76 + 7,410.37 + 9,590.47 + 8,766.09 = 395,393.99\n\nLet me verify this total once more to ensure accuracy:\n\nSum of all Sales Expenses transactions = 395,393.99\n\nTherefore, the total sales expenses for the income statement is 395,393.99, which rounded to 2 decimal places is 395,394.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Selling Expenses': '395393.99'}}\n```",
