These would have \"Account Payable\" as the payment method and \"Unpaid\" status.\n\nFrom the transaction data, I can identify:\n\n1. Purchase20231231005 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 2700000.0 | 2700000.0 | Director | Supervisor | Unpaid | Account Payable | 100000.0 | S001 | Supplier 1 | P004 | Chemical Product D | 27.0 | 100000.0\n\nThis is the only purchase transaction that uses \"Account Payable\" as the payment method and has an \"Unpaid\" status.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate initial accounts payable (as of Dec 31, 2023)\nSince the purchase transaction with account payable was made on 2023-12-31 (the first day of our dataset), the initial accounts payable would be 2,700,000.00.\n\n## Step 3: Find any payments against accounts payable or new accounts payable added\nLooking through the transactions, I don't see any payments made against existing accounts payable or any additional accounts payable created during the period. The single transaction identified remains unpaid.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate final accounts payable (as of the end of Jan 2024)\nSince there were no changes to the accounts payable amount during the period, the final amount remains the same as the initial amount: 2,700,000.00.\n\nTherefore, the accounts payable values for the balance sheet are:\n- Initial value: 2,700,000.00\n- End value: 2,700,000.00\n\nFormatting as required:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Payable Initial Value': '2700000.00', 'Accounts Payable End Value': '2700000.00'}}\n```",
