For fixed assets on the balance sheet, we typically show:\n- Fixed assets at cost\n- Less: Accumulated depreciation\n\nSince the problem asks for fixed assets item in the balance sheet, I need to check whether I should report gross or net value. The most standard approach would be to report the net value (after depreciation).\n\nAfter reviewing the problem again and considering the nature of the task, I've concluded that the final fixed assets value should indeed be calculated as the initial value plus additions, minus depreciation.\n\nTherefore:\n- Initial Fixed Assets Value: 5,000,000.00\n- End Fixed Assets Value: 7,219,522.72\n\nHowever, on further consideration of the example solution provided in the task description, it shows:\n```\n{'Fixed Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Fixed Assets End Value': '5305354.43'}\n```\n\nThe end value in the example is much closer to the initial value plus a single fixed asset purchase (305,354.43). This suggests that in the example, only certain fixed asset purchases were considered, or the depreciation was handled differently.\n\nLet me reconsider the approach and interpretation.\n\nLooking more carefully at the data, the fixed asset purchase mentioned in the example has a specific asset name \"Storage Facilities4\" with a value of 305,354.43. In my data, I see similar fixed asset purchases with specific asset names.\n\nGiven the example solution and the consistent structure of the data, I believe the correct interpretation is:\n\n- Initial Fixed Assets Value: 5,000,000.00\n- End Fixed Assets Value: 5,000,000.00 + 2,265,288.42 = 7,265,288.42\n\nThat said, the example shows a much smaller end value. Since I'm uncertain about the exact reconciliation method expected, I'll follow the most accurate accounting principle, which includes all fixed asset additions.\n\nUpon final review, I've decided to report:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Fixed Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Fixed Assets End Value': '7265288.42'} }\n```\n\nActually, I need to consider whether depreciation should be included. The standard accounting practice would deduct depreciation from the fixed assets value. However, since the example shows a simpler calculation (just adding one purchase), let me check one more time.\n\nAfter careful consideration of the problem statement and the example, I believe the correct interpretation is to:\n1. Take the initial fixed assets value\n2. Add all fixed asset purchases during the period\n3. Do not deduct depreciation (as it appears this is handled elsewhere or is being tracked as accumulated depreciation)\n\nTherefore, my final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Fixed Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Fixed Assets End Value': '7265288.42'} }\n```",
