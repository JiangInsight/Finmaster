                        "content": "I need to calculate the requested financial ratios based on the provided financial statements. Let me work through each ratio step by step.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company collects payments from customers.\nFormula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nSince we only have end-period accounts receivable (not beginning), I'll use:\n- Net Credit Sales = Main Business Revenue = $7,099,920.95\n- Accounts Receivable = $3,558,301.64\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $7,099,920.95 / $3,558,301.64 = 1.995\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow generated from operations.\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\n- Operating Cash Flow = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = $(5,394,333.52)\n- Current Liabilities = $3,054,996.05\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = $(5,394,333.52) / $3,054,996.05 = -1.77\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio calculated above.\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -1.77\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\nFormula: Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\n- Net Sales = Main Business Revenue = $7,099,920.95\n- Average Total Assets = (Beginning Assets + Ending Assets) / 2 = ($13,000,000 + $14,879,933.86) / 2 = $13,939,966.93\n\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = $7,099,920.95 / $13,939,966.93 = 0.51\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures a company's financial leverage.\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Shareholders' Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities = $3,054,996.05\n- Shareholders' Equity = $11,824,937.81\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $3,054,996.05 / $11,824,937.81 = 0.26\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.00\", \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-1.77\", \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.77\", \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.51\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.26\"}}\n```",
