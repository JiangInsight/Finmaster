The formula is:\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nStep 1: Find Net Credit Sales.\nSince we don't have specific information about credit sales, I'll use the Main Business Revenue from the income statement as Net Credit Sales.\nNet Credit Sales = $7,099,920.95\n\nStep 2: Calculate Average Accounts Receivable.\nBeginning Accounts Receivable (from initial balance sheet) = $0\nEnding Accounts Receivable (from end balance sheet) = $3,558,301.64\nAverage Accounts Receivable = ($0 + $3,558,301.64) / 2 = $1,779,150.82\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio.\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $7,099,920.95 / $1,779,150.82 = 3.99\n\nStep 4: Round to 2 decimal places.\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 3.99\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.99'} }\n```",
