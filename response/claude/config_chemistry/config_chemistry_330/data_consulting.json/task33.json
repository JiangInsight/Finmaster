                        "content": "I'll solve this task step by step by calculating the requested financial ratios from the provided financial statements.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to cover current liabilities with cash generated from operations.\n- Operating Cash Flow = -5,394,333.52\n- Current Liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -5,394,333.52 / 3,054,996.05 = -1.77\n\n## 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nThis measures the company's ability to repay its debt using operating cash flow.\n- Operating Cash Flow = -5,394,333.52\n- Total Liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -5,394,333.52 / 3,054,996.05 = -1.77\n\n## 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\nThis shows how efficiently a company is managing inventory.\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 5,540,000.00\n- Average Inventory = (0 + 3,760,000.00) / 2 = 1,880,000.00\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = 5,540,000.00 / 1,880,000.00 = 2.95\n\n## 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures the proportion of equity and debt used to finance assets.\n- Total Liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n- Total Equity = 11,824,937.81\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = 3,054,996.05 / 11,824,937.81 = 0.26\n\n## 5. Quick Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n- Quick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 7,660,411.14 - 3,760,000.00 = 3,900,411.14\n- Current Liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n- Quick Ratio = 3,900,411.14 / 3,054,996.05 = 1.28\n\n## 6. Current Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations.\n- Current Assets = 7,660,411.14\n- Current Liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n- Current Ratio = 7,660,411.14 / 3,054,996.05 = 2.51\n\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.77', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.77', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '2.95', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.26', 'Quick Ratio': '1.28', 'Current Ratio': '2.51'}}",
