Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n- Operating Cash Flow = -5,394,333.52 (from cash flow statement)\n- Current Liabilities = 3,054,996.05 (from balance sheet)\n- Ratio = -5,394,333.52 / 3,054,996.05 = -1.77\n\n## 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n- Total Liabilities = 3,054,996.05 (from balance sheet - only current liabilities are present)\n- Total Equity = 11,824,937.81 (from balance sheet)\n- Ratio = 3,054,996.05 / 11,824,937.81 = 0.26\n\n## 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n- Revenue = 7,099,920.95 (from income statement)\n- Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 14,879,933.86) / 2 = 13,939,966.93\n- Ratio = 7,099,920.95 / 13,939,966.93 = 0.51\n\n## 4. Quick Ratio\n- Quick Assets = Cash + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable\n- Quick Assets = 145,666.48 + 194,711.58 + 3,558,301.64 + 1,731.44 = 3,900,411.14\n- Current Liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n- Ratio = 3,900,411.14 / 3,054,996.05 = 1.28\n\n## 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n- Operating Cash Flow = -5,394,333.52\n- Current Liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n- Ratio = -5,394,333.52 / 3,054,996.05 = -1.77\n(This is the same as #1 Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio)\n\n## 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n- Net Profit = -1,175,062.19\n- Average Equity = (13,000,000.00 + 11,824,937.81) / 2 = 12,412,468.91\n- ROE = (-1,175,062.19 / 12,412,468.91) * 100% = -9.47%\n\n## 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n- Revenue = 7,099,920.95\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 3,558,301.64) / 2 = 1,779,150.82\n- Ratio = 7,099,920.95 / 1,779,150.82 = 3.99\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.77\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.26\", \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.51\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.28\", \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.77\", \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"-9.47%\", \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.99\"}}\n```",
