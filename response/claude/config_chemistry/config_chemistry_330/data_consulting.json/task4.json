Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $3,054,996.05\n   (There are no non-current liabilities listed)\n\n2. Total Owner's Equity = $11,824,937.81\n\n3. Calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio:\n   Debt to Equity Ratio = $3,054,996.05 / $11,824,937.81 = 0.2583\n\n4. Rounding to 2 decimal places: 0.26\n\nTherefore, the Debt to Equity Ratio as of January 29, 2024 is 0.26.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.26'}}\n```",
