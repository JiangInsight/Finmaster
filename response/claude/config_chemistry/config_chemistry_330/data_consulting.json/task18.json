From the cash flow statement, I can see that the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is -5,394,333.52\n\n2. From the balance sheet, the Total Current Liabilities is 3,054,996.05\n\nNow I'll calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -5,394,333.52 / 3,054,996.05\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -1.77\n\nThe result should be rounded to 2 decimal places, so the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is -1.77.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.77'}}\n```",
