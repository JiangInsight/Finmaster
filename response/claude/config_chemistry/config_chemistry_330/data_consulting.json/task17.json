Operating Cash Flow: From the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is -$5,394,333.52\n\n2. Total Debt: From the balance sheet, this includes all liabilities:\n   - Current Liabilities: $3,054,996.05\n   - There appears to be no long-term debt listed, so Total Debt = $3,054,996.05\n\nNow, I can calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -$5,394,333.52 / $3,054,996.05 = -1.77\n\nLet me format the value to two decimal places:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -1.77\n\nTherefore, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is -1.77.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.77'} }\n```",
