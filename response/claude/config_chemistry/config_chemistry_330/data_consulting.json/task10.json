This ratio shows a company's ability to cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from operations.\n\nThe formula is:\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -5,394,333.52\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (End amount) = 3,054,996.05\n\nNow I'll calculate the ratio:\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -5,394,333.52 / 3,054,996.05 = -1.766\n\nRounding to two decimal places: -1.77\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.77'} }\n```",
