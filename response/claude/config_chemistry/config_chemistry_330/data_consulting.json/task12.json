The formula for ROE is:\n\nROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the income statement, I can see:\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = -1,175,062.19\n\nFrom the balance sheet, I can determine:\n- Beginning Shareholders' Equity = 13,000,000.00 (Initial_amount from Total Owner's Equity)\n- Ending Shareholders' Equity = 11,824,937.81 (End_amount from Total Owner's Equity)\n\nNow I'll calculate the average shareholders' equity:\nAverage Shareholders' Equity = (Beginning Shareholders' Equity + Ending Shareholders' Equity) / 2\nAverage Shareholders' Equity = (13,000,000.00 + 11,824,937.81) / 2\nAverage Shareholders' Equity = 12,412,468.91\n\nNow I can calculate ROE:\nROE = -1,175,062.19 / 12,412,468.91\nROE = -0.0946 or approximately -9.46%\n\nTherefore, the Return on Equity (ROE) is -9.46%.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '-9.46%'}}\n```",
