First, I'll look at all transaction entries in the table\n2. For each entry, I'll compare the recorded fields with the information in the invoice description\n3. I'll identify any inconsistencies where the recorded values don't match what's in the invoice\n4. I'll focus especially on payment/receipt status, as this appears to be a potential issue area\n\nLooking at the data, I notice an inconsistency in transaction ID \"Interest20240114014\":\n\n- The recorded payment/receipt_status is \"Paid\"\n- However, the invoice description states: \"On January 14, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Interest Receivables, totaling $-31.83. The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable, and this transaction was **unpaid**.\"\n\nThis is a clear inconsistency where the recorded payment status doesn't match the invoice description. The invoice is the more reliable source of information, so the payment status should be \"Unpaid\" rather than \"Paid\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Interest20240114014'} }\n```",
