The cost amount for this transaction was $400000.00, with a tax amount of $26769.65, leading to a total amount due of $508623.43. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\nComparing with recorded data:\n- Recorded quantity: 3.0 (Invoice states 4.0)\n- Recorded amount: $401544.81 (Invoice states $535393.08)\n- Recorded payment/receipt_status: \"Unpaid\" (Invoice states \"paid\")\n- Recorded profit: $109281.87 (Calculated from invoice: $535393.08 - $400000.00 = $135393.08)\n\nThe invoice is considered more reliable, so these are clear inconsistencies. The recorded quantity, payment status, and profit don't match what's in the invoice.\n\nLet me check the math:\n- 4 units × $133848.27 = $535393.08 ✓\n- $535393.08 - $400000.00 = $135393.08 ✓\n- $535393.08 - $26769.65 = $508623.43 ✓\n\nThe inconsistencies appear to be:\n1. Recorded quantity (3.0) vs. Invoice quantity (4.0)\n2. Recorded payment status (\"Unpaid\") vs. Invoice status (\"paid\")\n3. Recorded profit ($109281.87) vs. Calculated profit ($135393.08)\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original quantity\": \"4.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"3.0\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Original profit\": \"135393.08\", \"Recorded profit\": \"109281.87\", \"id\": \"Sale20240108016\"}}\n```",
