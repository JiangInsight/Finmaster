Also, 3 units Ã— $12877.89 = $38633.67, which matches the recorded amount but not the invoice total of $51511.56 which would be correct for 4 units.\n\nBased on the invoice details, the correct quantity should be 4.0 units.\n\nLet me check for other possible inconsistencies:\n\nLooking at the entire dataset, I don't see any other clear mismatches between invoice details and recorded values. The Sale20240112020 is the only transaction where there's a clear inconsistency between the invoice information and the recorded data.\n\nThe invoice states 4.0 units but the record shows 3.0 units, with the amount calculated based on the incorrect quantity.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '4.0', 'Recorded quantity': '3.0', 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '51511.56', 'Recorded amount': '38633.67', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': '11511.56', 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240112020'} }\n```",
