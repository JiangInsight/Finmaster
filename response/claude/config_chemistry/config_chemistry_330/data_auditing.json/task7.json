First, I notice that many Interest Receivables transactions have the receive_method listed as \"Interest receviable\" while the correct spelling should be \"Interest receivable\" (with \"i\" before \"v\").\n\n2. Looking at Sale20240126048, the invoice field says \"account receviable\" but the recorded_receive_method shows \"Account Receivable\". This is an inconsistency in spelling.\n\nBased on this analysis, I've identified two transactions with inconsistencies:\n\nFor Interest transactions: All interest transactions show \"Interest receviable\" in the receive_method field, but the correct spelling should be \"Interest receivable\".\n\nFor Sale20240126048: The recorded_receive_method is \"Account Receivable\" while the invoice shows \"account receviable\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Account Receivable', 'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240126048'} }\n```",
