The recorded_type is \"Purchase\" but the invoice description clearly states it's a \"Sale\"\n2. The recorded_quantity is 2.0 but the invoice description mentions \"consisting of 3.0 units\"\n3. The recorded_amount (255009.82) doesn't match what would be expected for 3 units at the unit price\n4. The total amount in the invoice (382514.73) doesn't match the recorded amount\n\nThis indicates the transaction was incorrectly categorized as a purchase when it should be a sale, and the quantity was incorrectly recorded as 2 instead of 3.\n\nThe invoice description states this is a Sale transaction for 3.0 units at a unit price of $127504.91, with a total of $382514.73, which would be consistent with 3 units.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Purchase', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '3.0', 'Recorded quantity': '2.0', 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '382514.73', 'Recorded amount': '255009.82', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240108015'} }\n```",
