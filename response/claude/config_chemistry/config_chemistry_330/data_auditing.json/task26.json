The recorded_type is \"Sale\" but the invoice description refers to it as a \"Sales Expenses\"\n2. The recorded_date is \"2024-01-28\" but the invoice states \"January 22, 2024\"\n3. The recorded_amount is $8509.64 but the invoice mentions $7410.37\n\nThis transaction has inconsistencies in multiple fields, making it clearly problematic. The invoice description is considered more reliable since it's standardized and regulated.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Recorded category': 'Sale', 'Original date': '2024-01-22', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-28', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '7410.37', 'Recorded amount': '8509.64', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240122001'} }\n```",
