The recorded_type is \"Sale\" but this is an expense transaction (ID starts with \"Expense\").\n2. Looking at the invoice field: \"On January 23, 2024, an invoice was issued for a **Sales Expenses**, totaling $9590.47...\"\n3. The recorded_amount is $11480.93, but the invoice states $9590.47.\n\nThis transaction has two inconsistencies:\n1. Wrong category: Recorded as \"Sale\" but should be \"Sales Expenses\"\n2. Wrong amount: Recorded as $11480.93 but should be $9590.47\n\nI don't see any other clear inconsistencies in the other transactions. Each field appears to match with the information provided in the invoice description.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Recorded category': 'Sale', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '9590.47', 'Recorded amount': '11480.93', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240123001'} }\n```",
