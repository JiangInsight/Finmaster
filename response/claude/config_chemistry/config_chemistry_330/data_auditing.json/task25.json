Recorded date: \"2024-01-24\" but the invoice and ID indicate \"2024-01-17\"\n3. Recorded price: \"25108.43\" but the invoice states \"23617.03\"\n\nAccording to the invoice: \"On January 17, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $23617.03, totaling $47234.06.
