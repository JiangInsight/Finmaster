The recorded amount is $1,464,969.60, but according to the invoice, it should be $1,200,000.00 (24 units at $50,000 per unit)\n2. The recorded price is $49,177.34, but according to the invoice and recorded_cost_per_unit, it should be $50,000.00\n\nThe invoice states: \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Purchase, consisting of 24.0 units at a unit price of $50000.00, totaling $1200000.00.\"\n\nHowever, the recorded amount is $1,464,969.60 and the recorded unit price is $49,177.34.\n\nSince the invoice is standardized and regulated (as mentioned in the task description), it's generally considered more reliable than the other recorded fields. Therefore, I'll consider the invoice values to be the correct ones.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"50000.0\", \"Recorded price\": \"49177.34\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"1200000.0\", \"Recorded amount\": \"1464969.6\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Purchase20231231004\"} }\n```",
