Since the invoice is considered more reliable, these are errors that need to be corrected.\n\nFor Expense20240127001, the correct values based on the invoice are:\n- Original amount: $41601.35 (instead of recorded $50296.99)\n- Original payment/receipt_status: \"Paid\" (instead of recorded \"Unpaid\")\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '41601.35', 'Recorded amount': '50296.99', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240127001'} }\n```",
