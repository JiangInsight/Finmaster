For transaction ID \"Expense20240107001\", there's a date discrepancy:\n   - The recorded_date shows \"2024-01-31\"\n   - But the invoice field states \"On January 07, 2024, an invoice was issued...\"\n   - This indicates the original date should be 2024-01-07, not 2024-01-31\n\n2. For transaction ID \"Expense20240129001\", there's a date discrepancy:\n   - The recorded_date shows \"2024-02-14\"\n   - But the invoice field states \"On January 29, 2024, an invoice was issued...\"\n   - This indicates the original date should be 2024-01-29, not 2024-02-14\n\nThese inconsistencies are date recording errors where the transaction date in the system doesn't match the actual invoice date.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-07', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-31', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240107001'} }\n```",
