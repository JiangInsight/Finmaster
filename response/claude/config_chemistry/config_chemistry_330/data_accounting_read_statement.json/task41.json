Since the value is positive (354996.05), it indicates an increase in tax payable, which means more taxes have been accrued than paid during this period.\n\nTherefore, the value representing the increase in the amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid is 354996.05.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '354996.05'}}\n```",
