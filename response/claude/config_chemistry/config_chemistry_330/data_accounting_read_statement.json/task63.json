Net amount of cash and cash equivalents from principal revenue-producing activities (operating activities)\n2. Taxes accrued but not yet paid\n3. Total income arising from ordinary activities\n\nLet me analyze the financial statements:\n\nFor the first value, I need to find the net cash flow from operating activities in the Cash Flow Statement. In this statement, I can see:\n- \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" = -5394333.52\n\nFor the second value, I need to find taxes payable from the Balance Sheet. In this statement:\n- \"Taxes Payable\" = 354996.05\n\nFor the third value, I need to find total revenue from the Income Statement:\n- \"Total Revenue\" = 7099920.95\n\nThese are the three values I'm looking for.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '354996.05', 'value2': '7099920.95', 'value3': '-5394333.52'} }\n```",
