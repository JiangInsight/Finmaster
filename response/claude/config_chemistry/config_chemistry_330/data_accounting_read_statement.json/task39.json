The line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" shows changes in these assets.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n- The line item is \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\"\n- The value is \"-3760000.00\"\n\nThe negative value indicates an increase in inventory (more assets held for sale), which means there was not a reduction but rather an increase in these assets during the period. However, the task asks for the value of reduction, so I need to provide this figure.\n\nSince the value shows an increase of 3760000.00, the reduction value is -3760000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-3760000.00'}}\n```",
