These typically include items like:\n- Interest income\n- Dividend income\n- Investment income\n- Gains from financial instruments\n\nIn the given income statement, I can see a line item called \"Interest Income\" with a value of 1731.44. This represents income earned from financial assets (likely from deposits, loans, or other interest-bearing financial instruments).\n\nNo other income from financial assets (such as dividend income or investment gains) is listed in this income statement.\n\nTherefore, the income earned from financial assets is 1731.44.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1731.44'} }\n```",
