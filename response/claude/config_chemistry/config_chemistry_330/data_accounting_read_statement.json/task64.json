The profit or loss for the period before deducting tax expense (from Income Statement)\n2. The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit (from Balance Sheet)\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares (from Balance Sheet)\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- \"Accounts Payable\" shows End_amount of \"2700000.00\", which represents the amount owed by the entity\n- \"Paid-in Capital\" shows End_amount of \"13000000.00\", which represents capital contributed by shareholders\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- \"Profit Before Tax\" shows Amount of \"-820066.14\", which represents profit or loss before deducting tax expense\n\nTherefore, the three values I need to extract are:\n- value1: \"13000000.00\" (Paid-in Capital)\n- value2: \"-820066.14\" (Profit Before Tax)\n- value3: \"2700000.00\" (Accounts Payable)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '-820066.14', 'value3': '2700000.00'}}\n```",
