In financial statements, these costs are typically categorized under \"Selling Expenses\" since they represent costs associated with selling products to customers and delivering them.\n\nFrom the income statement provided, I can see:\n- \"Selling Expenses\" of 395393.99 on 2024-01-29\n\nThis is the specific line item that represents costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services. The \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is the cost of producing the goods but not the cost of selling or delivering them.\n\nTherefore, the value of costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services is 395393.99.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '395393.99'}}\n```",
