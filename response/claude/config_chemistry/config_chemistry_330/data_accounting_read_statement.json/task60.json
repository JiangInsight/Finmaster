The income earned by an entity from financial assets\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\n## 1. Balance Sheet\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, I can see that \"Bank Deposits\" represents funds deposited into a bank, with an end amount of 194711.58 as of 2024-01-29.\n\n## 2. Income Statement\nIn the Income Statement, \"Interest Income\" represents income earned from financial assets, with a value of 1731.44 as of 2024-01-29.\n\n## 3. Cash Flow Statement\nThis confirms the figures I've identified from the other statements, but doesn't provide different values for these specific line items.\n\nTherefore, the two values I need to extract are:\n- Bank Deposits (end value): 194711.58\n- Interest Income: 1731.44\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '194711.58', 'value2': '1731.44'}}\n```",
