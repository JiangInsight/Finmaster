Total income arising in the course of an entity's ordinary activities - This would be the \"Total Revenue\" line item.\n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period - This would be the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" line item.\n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole - This would be the \"Administrative Expenses\" line item.\n\nLooking at the income statement provided:\n- Total Revenue: 7099920.95\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 5540000.00\n- Administrative Expenses: 1529708.19\n\nTherefore, my solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '7099920.95', 'value2': '5540000.00', 'value3': '1529708.19'}}\n```",
