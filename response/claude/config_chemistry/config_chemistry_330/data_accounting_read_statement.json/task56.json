First, I check the balance sheet - I see \"Accumulated Depreciation\" with an end amount of 45765.70 as of 2024-01-29.\n\n2. Second, I check the cash flow statement - I see a line item \"Depreciation\" with an amount of 45765.70.\n\n3. Third, I check the income statement - I see a line item \"Depreciation\" with an amount of 45765.70.\n\nAll three statements consistently show the same value for depreciation. The income statement and cash flow statement specifically have a line item called \"Depreciation\" with the value of 45765.70, which represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of assets over their useful lives during the reporting period.\n\nTherefore, the depreciation value is 45765.70.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45765.70'}}\n```",
