Current assets are those expected to be realized within the operating cycle, while non-current assets are those that aren't expected to be realized quickly.\n\nThe line item \"Total Non-current Assets\" represents exactly what we're looking for. From the balance sheet:\n\n- Initial value of Total Non-current Assets: 5000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- End value of Total Non-current Assets: 7219522.72 (as of 2024-01-29)\n\nThese are the assets that are not expected to be realized or intended for sale in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '7219522.72'}}\n```",
