In the balance sheet, there's a line \"Taxes Payable\" with an end amount of 354996.05 as of 2024-01-29.\n\n2. In the cash flow statement, there's a line \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an amount of 354996.05.\n\n3. In the income statement, there's a line \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of 354996.05.\n\nThe most direct representation of the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period is the \"Tax Expense\" line in the income statement, which shows 354996.05.\n\nThis matches the \"Taxes Payable\" in the balance sheet and the increase in tax payable in the cash flow statement, confirming that this is the correct value.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '354996.05'} }\n```",
