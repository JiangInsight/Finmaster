The value is -2,265,288.42.\n\nThe only sub-item contributing to this is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of 2,265,288.42 (shown as a positive number in the statement, but it represents a cash outflow).\n\nTherefore:\n- The net cash flow from investing activities is -2,265,288.42\n- The sub-item (Purchase of Fixed Assets) value is 2,265,288.42\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2265288.42', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '2265288.42'}} }\n```",
