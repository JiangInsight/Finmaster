The account \"Cash on Hand\" represents cash readily available for day-to-day operations.\n   - Initial amount: 3000000.00 on 2023-12-31\n   - End amount: 145666.48 on 2024-01-29\n\n2. The account \"Bank Deposits\" also represents cash available for operations.\n   - Initial amount: 5000000.00 on 2023-12-31\n   - End amount: 194711.58 on 2024-01-29\n\nFor this task, I need to identify the specific line items and value of cash available for day-to-day operations. Based on the example solution, \"Cash on Hand\" is considered the primary cash for operational use.\n\nTherefore, the initial value is 3000000.00 and the end value is 145666.48.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '3000000.00', 'end value': '145666.48'}}\n```",
