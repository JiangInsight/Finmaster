The net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- I can see \"Interest Receivable\" with an end amount of 1731.44\nThis represents interest accrued but not yet received.\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- I can see \"Net Increase\" in Cash and Cash Equivalents is -7659621.94\nThis represents the net addition (in this case, a reduction) in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\nThe Income Statement confirms the interest income amount of 1731.44, which matches the Interest Receivable in the Balance Sheet.\n\nTherefore, the two values I need to extract are:\n- Interest accrued but not yet received: 1731.44\n- Net addition in cash and cash equivalents: -7659621.94\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1731.44', 'value2': '-7659621.94'} }\n```",
