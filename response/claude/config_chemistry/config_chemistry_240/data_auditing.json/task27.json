The recorded_type is \"Administrative Expenses\" but the ID prefix is \"Purchase\" and the invoice description clearly states it's a Purchase transaction\n2. The recorded_amount ($1,331,256.33) doesn't match what should be calculated from quantity × unit price (25 × $50,000 = $1,250,000)\n3. The recorded_unit_price ($47,176.59) doesn't match what's stated in the invoice text ($50,000)\n\nLooking at the invoice text: \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Purchase, consisting of 25.0 units at a unit price of $50000.00, totaling $1250000.00...\"\n\nThis confirms that:\n- The correct category is \"Purchase\" (not \"Administrative Expenses\")\n- The correct unit price is $50,000 (not $47,176.59)\n- The correct total amount is $1,250,000 (not $1,331,256.33)\n\nSince the invoice is a standardized and regulated document, it's considered more reliable than the potentially erroneous entries in the transaction record.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Purchase\", \"Recorded category\": \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"50000.0\", \"Recorded price\": \"47176.59\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"1250000.0\", \"Recorded amount\": \"1331256.33\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Purchase20231231010\"}}\n```",
