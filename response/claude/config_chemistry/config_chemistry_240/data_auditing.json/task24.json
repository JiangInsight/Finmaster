First, I'll check Purchase20231231007:\n   - The recorded amount is $372,781.75\n   - The recorded price is $22,166.84\n   - The invoice says \"totaling $340,000.00\" and \"at a unit price of $20,000.00\"\n   - When we multiply the quantity (17 units) by the unit price stated in the invoice ($20,000), we get $340,000\n   - This confirms an inconsistency between the recorded amount/price and what the invoice states\n\nThis is a clear inconsistency where the recorded values don't match what's stated in the invoice. Since invoices are generally more reliable as standardized documents, I'll use them as the basis for determining the correct values.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"20000.0\", \"Recorded price\": \"22166.84\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"340000.0\", \"Recorded amount\": \"372781.75\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Purchase20231231007\"}}\n```",
