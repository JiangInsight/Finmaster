The cost amount for this transaction was $100000.00, with a tax amount of $6152.17, leading to a total amount due of $116891.13. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nThe inconsistencies I notice:\n1. The recorded_type is \"Depreciation\" but the invoice clearly states this is a \"Sale\"\n2. The recorded_unit_price is $65397.19, but the invoice states $61521.65\n\nThis matches the pattern in the example where a sale transaction was incorrectly recorded as depreciation. The invoice is generally considered more reliable as it's a standardized, regulated document.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Depreciation\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"61521.65\", \"Recorded price\": \"65397.19\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240103006\"}}\n```",
