First, I'll check for Purchase20231231001, where I notice a discrepancy in the recorded amount (190000.0) vs the invoice calculation (19.0 units Ã— 10000.0 per unit = 190000.0), which matches.\n\n2. For Sale20240123049, I notice several discrepancies:\n   - The recorded date is 2024-02-17, but the invoice states \"On January 23, 2024\"\n   - The recorded unit price (50651.72) doesn't match the invoice (59988.65)\n   - The recorded total amount (72868.98) doesn't match the invoice (59988.65)\n   - The recorded tax amount (56399.45) is unusually high and doesn't match the invoice (2999.43)\n\nThe invoice details for Sale20240123049 state:\n\"On January 23, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $59988.65, totaling $59988.65. The cost amount for this transaction was $50000.00, with a tax amount of $2999.43, leading to a total amount due of $56989.22. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\nThe discrepancies in Sale20240123049 are significant and affect multiple fields, so I'll include all of them in my solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": \"2024-01-23\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-02-17\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"59988.65\", \"Recorded price\": \"50651.72\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"59988.65\", \"Recorded amount\": \"72868.98\", \"Original tax\": \"2999.43\", \"Recorded tax\": \"56399.45\", \"Original profit\": \"9988.65\", \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240123049\"}}\n```",
