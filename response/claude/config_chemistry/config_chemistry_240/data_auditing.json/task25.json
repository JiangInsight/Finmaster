Transaction type inconsistency:\n   - Recorded type: \"Administrative Expenses\"\n   - ID begins with \"Sale\" suggesting it should be a \"Sale\" transaction\n   - Invoice text confirms it's a sale: \"an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 4.0 units...\"\n\n2. Date inconsistency:\n   - Recorded date: \"2024-02-14\"\n   - Invoice text states: \"On January 20, 2024...\"\n\n3. Unit price inconsistency:\n   - Recorded unit price: $66203.05\n   - Invoice text mentions: \"a unit price of $68183.08\"\n\nThe inconsistencies indicate this transaction was incorrectly categorized as an administrative expense with the wrong date and unit price. Based on the invoice text and transaction ID, this should be a sale transaction on January 20, 2024, with a unit price of $68183.08.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Administrative Expenses', 'Original date': '2024-01-20', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-14', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '68183.08', 'Recorded price': '66203.05', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240120044'} }\n```",
