The recorded type is \"Purchase\" but should be \"Sale\" (confirmed by invoice and ID)\n  2. The recorded tax amount is $68,653.62 but according to the invoice it should be $3,177.12\n\n### Other Transactions\nI examined all other transactions and did not find any additional inconsistencies between the recorded data and the invoice descriptions.\n\n## Step 2: Preparing the Solution\nBased on my analysis, I found inconsistencies in Sale20240117036:\n\n1. Transaction type mismatch: Recorded as \"Purchase\" when it should be \"Sale\"\n2. Tax amount error: Recorded as $68,653.62 when it should be $3,177.12\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Purchase', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': '3177.12', 'Recorded tax': '68653.62', 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240117036'} }",
