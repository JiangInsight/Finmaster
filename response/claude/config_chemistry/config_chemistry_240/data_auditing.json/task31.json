I'll focus on mathematical relationships (like quantity Ã— unit price = amount) and check the invoice text against recorded values.\n\nLet me start with Sale20240125052:\n\n1. According to the invoice text: \"Sale, consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $11588.24, totaling $23176.48.\"\n2. But the recorded values show:\n   - Recorded quantity: 1.0\n   - Recorded unit price: $10190.29\n   - Recorded amount: $26743.97\n   - Recorded tax: $25426.52\n\nThis shows multiple inconsistencies:\n- The quantity should be 2.0, not 1.0\n- The unit price should be $11588.24, not $10190.29\n- The total amount should be $23176.48, not $26743.97\n- The tax should be $1158.82, not $25426.52\n\nNext, checking other transactions:\n\nFor Sale20240130057:\n1. According to the invoice: \"Sale, consisting of 3.0 units at a unit price of $24766.75, totaling $74300.25.\"\n2. But the recorded values show:\n   - Recorded quantity: 2.0\n   - Recorded unit price: $25021.15\n   - Recorded amount: $49533.5\n   - Recorded tax: $81724.53\n\nThis also shows inconsistencies, with incorrect quantity, price, amount, and tax values.\n\nTherefore, my solution includes the inconsistencies in these transactions:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original quantity': '2.00', 'Recorded quantity': '1.00', 'Original price': '11588.24', 'Recorded price': '10190.29', 'Original amount': '23176.48', 'Recorded amount': '26743.97', 'Original tax': '1158.82', 'Recorded tax': '25426.52', 'id': 'Sale20240125052'} }\n```",
