The cost amount for this transaction was $250000.00...\"\n\nThis confirms that the recorded profit is incorrect. The transaction has an internal inconsistency where the profit doesn't match what it should be based on the total amount and cost amount.\n\nTherefore, for this transaction ID \"Sale20240104007\", the correct profit should be $74,628.85, but it's recorded as $55,299.59.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': '74628.85', 'Recorded profit': '55299.59', 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240104007'} }\n```",
