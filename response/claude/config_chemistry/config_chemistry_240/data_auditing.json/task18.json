The correct profit would be \"1505.06\" (calculated from total amount 11505.06 - cost 10000.00).\n\n## Transaction ID: Sale20240103006\nLooking at this transaction:\n- The invoice mentions \"consisting of 2.0 units\" but the total price and other calculations suggest it should be more units.\n- The total amount is \"123043.30\" which at a unit price of \"61521.65\" would indicate 2 units.\n- However, the profit appears inconsistent. With a cost amount of \"100000.0\" and a total of \"123043.30\", the profit should be \"23043.30\", which matches the recorded profit.\n\nI don't see clear inconsistencies in this transaction based on the available data.\n\n## Other transactions\nI've reviewed the other transactions and don't see obvious inconsistencies based on the invoice descriptions and recorded values.\n\nTherefore, the primary inconsistency I can confidently identify is in Sale20240112027:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '1.0', 'Recorded quantity': '0.0', 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '11505.06', 'Recorded amount': '0.0', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': '1505.06', 'Recorded profit': '1302.53', 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240112027'} }\n```",
