The expense category (Financial vs Administrative)\n2. The amount ($10,754.94 vs $8,734.35)\n\nSince the invoice information is considered more reliable, I should flag this as an inconsistency.\n\nI don't see other clear inconsistencies in the rest of the transactions where recorded values contradict the invoice descriptions.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Administrative Expenses', 'Recorded category': 'Financial Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '8734.35', 'Recorded amount': '10754.94', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240116001'} }\n```",
