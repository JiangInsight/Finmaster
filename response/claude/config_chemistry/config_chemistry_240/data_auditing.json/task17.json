The transaction is labeled as \"Sales Expenses\" in the recorded_type column, but the invoice description says \"On January 05, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Interest Receivables, totaling $348.88.\"\n\n2. The recorded_receive_method is \"Account Receivable\", but the invoice states \"The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nThis indicates two errors:\n- The transaction type should be \"Interest Receivables\" (not \"Sales Expenses\")\n- The receive method should be \"Interest receviable\" (not \"Account Receivable\")\n\nThese inconsistencies can be confirmed when comparing this transaction with other similar interest transactions, which all have the correct transaction type and receive method.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Interest Receivables', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original receive_method': 'Interest receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Account Receivable', 'id': 'Interest20240105005'} }\n```",
