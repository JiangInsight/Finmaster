First, I need to identify the initial cash and bank deposit amounts at the beginning of the period.\n\nLooking at the data, I can see these initial balances:\n- Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | 3000000.0\n- Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0\n\nThese represent the beginning cash and cash equivalents balance for the company.\n\nThe cash deposit of 3,000,000.00 and bank deposit of 5,000,000.00 give a total initial balance of 8,000,000.00.\n\nThis is the beginning balance for the cash flow statement, representing the total amount of cash and cash equivalents the company had at the start of the reporting period.\n\nTherefore, the final beginning cash and cash equivalents balance in the cash flow statement is 8,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
