The depreciation transactions should have the type \"Depreciation\".\n\nLooking through the transactions data, I found one depreciation entry:\n\n| id | type | date | recorded_date | amount | recorded_amount |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45751.04 | 45751.04 |\n\nThis is the only depreciation transaction in the dataset. For the income statement, I should use the amount of this transaction, which is 45751.04.\n\nLet me verify this is the final amount by checking if there are any other depreciation entries or adjustments to this entry. Since I don't see any other depreciation entries or adjustments, I can conclude that the depreciation amount for the income statement is 45751.04.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45751.04'} }\n```",
