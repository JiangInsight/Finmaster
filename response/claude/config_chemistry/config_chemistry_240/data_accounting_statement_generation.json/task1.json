Looking at the data, I can see:\n```\n| Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 3000000.0 | 3000000.0 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n```\nThis shows the initial cash on hand was 3,000,000.00.\n\n## Step 2: Track all cash inflows and outflows\nTo determine the final cash on hand, I need to track:\n1. All cash sales (inflows)\n2. All cash purchases (outflows)\n3. All cash expenses (outflows)\n4.

Let me verify once more.\n\nAfter careful reanalysis, I found the ending cash on hand value to be:\n\nFinal Cash on Hand = 3,000,000.00 + 5,810,769.69 - 7,390,544.72 = 1,420,224.97\n\nBut given the precision required for financial reporting, and to avoid any errors in calculation, the verified final cash on hand is 1,420,224.97.\n\nHmm, looking at the sample solution and my answer, there seems to be a significant difference. Let me review the data once more to ensure accuracy.\n\nAfter careful reconsideration, my final value still differs from the expected value. However, to provide the most accurate answer based on my analysis, I will report:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash on Hand Initial Value': '3000000.00', 'Cash on Hand End Value': '1420224.97'} }\n```",
