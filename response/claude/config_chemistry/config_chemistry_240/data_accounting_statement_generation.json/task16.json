These would typically be indicated by specific transaction types related to:\n- Additional investments from owners/shareholders\n- Capital withdrawals by owners\n- Stock issuances\n\nAfter reviewing all transactions in the data, I don't see any transactions that would indicate additional paid-in capital contributions or reductions. The transactions are primarily related to:\n- Purchases\n- Sales\n- Expenses\n- Depreciation\n- Interest receivables\n- Cash transfers between accounts\n- Fixed asset purchases\n\n## Step 3: Determine the final paid-in capital value\nSince there were no additional capital contributions or withdrawals during the period, the ending paid-in capital remains the same as the initial value: 13,000,000.00.\n\nTherefore, both the initial and final values of paid-in capital are 13,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
