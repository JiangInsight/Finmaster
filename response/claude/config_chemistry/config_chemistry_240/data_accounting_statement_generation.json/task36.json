and sum all interest receivable transactions:\n\n- Interest20240101001: 428.09\n- Interest20240102002: 428.09\n- Interest20240103003: 388.04\n- Interest20240104004: 388.04\n- Interest20240105005:

Interest20240112012: 108.58\n- Interest20240113013: 62.57\n- Interest20240114014: 62.57\n- Interest20240115015: 62.57\n- Interest20240116016: 62.57\n- Interest20240117017: 62.57\n- Interest20240118018: 62.57\n- Interest20240119019: 62.57\n- Interest20240120020: 62.57\n- Interest20240121021: 62.57\n- Interest20240122022: 18.86\n- Interest20240123023: -7.84\n- Interest20240124024: -16.74\n- Interest20240125025: 9.96\n- Interest20240126026: 2.38\n- Interest20240127027: 11.28\n- Interest20240128028: 11.28\n\nTotal Interest Income: 4,838.46\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Net Profit\n\nNet Profit = Total Sales Profit + Interest Income - Total Expenses\nNet Profit = 1,642,307.76 + 4,838.46 - 2,553,649.65\nNet Profit = -906,503.43\n\nTherefore, the final net profit is -906,503.43, indicating a loss.\n\nHowever, I should double-check this calculation. Let me review the instructions again to make sure I've calculated this correctly.\n\nUpon review, I need to ensure I've accounted for all relevant items in the cash flow statement. Looking back at all transactions, I notice that I may have missed the need to include fixed asset purchases and depreciation in my expense calculations.\n\nSince depreciation was already included in the expenses I totaled, and fixed asset purchases are capital expenditures rather than operating expenses, my calculation approach is correct. However, I'll double-check my numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\nAfter rechecking all the calculations, I still arrive at a net profit of -906,503.43. However, the example result showed a different figure, so let me check if I've missed anything.\n\nAfter careful reexamination, I recall that for cash flow statements, some transactions affect cash but are not part of net profit calculation. Since the task specifically asks for the \"net profit item in the cash flow statement,\" I need to focus only on income statement items.\n\nNet profit should include:\n- Sales profits\n- Interest income\n- All operating expenses\n- Depreciation\n\nThe net profit figure from my calculations is -906,503.43, which reflects the operating result for the period.\n\nWait, I notice there may have been a miscalculation. Let me re-add the depreciation expense since it's a non-cash expense but impacts net profit:\n\nDepreciation20240101001: 45,751.04\n\nNet Profit = 1,642,307.76 + 4,838.46 - 2,553,649.65\nNet Profit = -906,503.43\n\nThis is still different from the expected output seen in the example solution. Let me perform a final check of my approach.\n\nUpon careful review, I believe the discrepancy might be in how I'm calculating sales profits. Instead of adding up the \"profit\" column directly, let me calculate it as:\n- Total Sales Revenue (Amount column for all sales) - Total Cost of Goods Sold (cost_amount column)\n\nBut this would give me the same result, as the profit column already represents this calculation.\n\nBased on my calculations and the given data, I believe the net profit is -906,503.43. However, due to the discrepancy with the example, I'll round this to:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '-906503.43'}}\n```",
