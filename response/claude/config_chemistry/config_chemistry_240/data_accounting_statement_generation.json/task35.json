I'll follow a step-by-step approach to calculate each component of the income statement.\n\n## Step 1: Calculate Revenue\nFirst, I'll identify all sales transactions to calculate the main business revenue.\n\nLooking through the data, all sales transactions have a type of \"Sale\" and they include the amount. I need to sum up all these transactions.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Cost of Goods Sold\nFor Cost of Goods Sold, I'll look at the \"cost_amount\" field in sales transactions, which represents the cost of the products sold.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Expenses\nI'll categorize and sum up all expense types:\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Sales Expenses\n- Depreciation\n- Financial Expenses\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Interest Income\nInterest income is found in transactions labeled \"Interest Receivables\".\n\n## Step 5: Calculate Tax\nTax amounts are found in the \"tax_amount\" field of sales transactions.\n\nLet me perform these calculations:\n\n### Revenue Calculation\nLooking at all transactions with type \"Sale\", the total revenue is the sum of all these amounts.\n\n### Cost of Goods Sold\nThe cost of goods sold is the sum of all \"cost_amount\" values in sale transactions.\n\n### Gross Profit\nGross Profit = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold\n\n### Expenses\n- Administrative Expenses: Sum of all transactions with type \"Administrative Expenses\"\n- Sales Expenses: Sum of all transactions with type \"Sales Expenses\"\n- Depreciation: Sum of all transactions with type \"Depreciation\"\n- Financial Expenses: Sum of all transactions with type \"Financial Expenses\"\n\n### Interest Income\nSum of all positive transactions with type \"Interest Receivables\"\n\n### Tax Expense\nSum of all \"tax_amount\" values in sale transactions\n\n### Net Profit\nNet Profit = Gross Profit - Total Expenses + Interest Income - Tax Expense\n\nAfter analyzing all the transactions, here are the final calculations:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Main Business Revenue\": \"7353248.89\",\n  \"Total Revenue\": \"7353248.89\",\n  \"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"5460000.00\",\n  \"Total Cost\": \"5460000.00\", \n  \"Gross Profit\": \"1893248.89\",\n  \"Administrative Expenses\": \"1683711.21\",\n  \"Selling Expenses\": \"497359.24\",\n  \"Depreciation\": \"45751.04\",\n  \"Financial Expenses\": \"475806.93\",\n  \"Total Expenses\": \"2702628.42\",\n  \"Interest Income\": \"2984.84\",\n  \"Profit Before Tax\": \"-806394.69\",\n  \"Tax Expense\": \"367662.44\",\n  \"Net Profit\": \"-1174057.13\"\n}}\n```",
