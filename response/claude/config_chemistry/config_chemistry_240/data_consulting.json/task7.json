The standard formula for FCF is:\n\nFCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,900,875.61\n- Capital Expenditures (Purchase of Fixed Assets) = 1,593,203.67\n\nTherefore:\nFCF = -4,900,875.61 - 1,593,203.67 = -6,494,079.28\n\nI can also verify this by looking at the Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents, which is -6,494,079.28, confirming our calculation.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-6494079.28'} }\n```",
