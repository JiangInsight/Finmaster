                        "content": "I'll calculate the requested financial ratios step by step.\n\n## 1. Current Ratio\nThe current ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations.\n- Formula: Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n- Current Assets = $8,538,597.02\n- Current Liabilities = $3,428,090.41\n- Current Ratio = $8,538,597.02 / $3,428,090.41 = 2.49\n\n## 2. Quick Ratio\nThe quick ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n- Formula: Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n- Current Assets - Inventory = $8,538,597.02 - $4,530,000.00 = $4,008,597.02\n- Current Liabilities = $3,428,090.41\n- Quick Ratio = $4,008,597.02 / $3,428,090.41 = 1.17\n\n## 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\nThe debt to asset ratio measures the percentage of assets financed by debt.\n- Formula: Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n- Total Liabilities = $3,428,090.41\n- Total Assets = $15,086,049.65\n- Debt to Asset Ratio = $3,428,090.41 / $15,086,049.65 = 0.23\n\n## 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThe debt to equity ratio measures a company's financial leverage.\n- Formula: Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n- Total Liabilities = $3,428,090.41\n- Total Equity = $11,657,959.24\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = $3,428,090.41 / $11,657,959.24 = 0.29\n\n## 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nThe cash flow to debt ratio measures a company's ability to pay off its debt using operating cash flow.\n- Formula: Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Liabilities\n- Operating Cash Flow = -$4,900,875.61\n- Total Liabilities = $3,428,090.41\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -$4,900,875.61 / $3,428,090.41 = -1.43\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '2.49', 'Quick Ratio': '1.17', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.23', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.29', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.43'}}\n```",
