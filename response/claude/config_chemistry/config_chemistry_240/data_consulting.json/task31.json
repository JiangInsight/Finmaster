                        "content": "I need to calculate five financial ratios based on the three financial statements provided. Let me work through each one systematically.\n\n## 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\nFormula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n- Net Credit Sales = Main Business Revenue = $8,361,807.77\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2 = ($0 + $2,498,141.24) / 2 = $1,249,070.62\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $8,361,807.77 / $1,249,070.62 = 6.69\n\n## 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to cover current liabilities with cash generated from operations.\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\n- Operating Cash Flow = -$4,900,875.61\n- Current Liabilities = $3,428,090.41\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$4,900,875.61 / $3,428,090.41 = -1.43\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio calculated above = -1.43\n\n## 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\nFormula: Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\n- Net Sales = $8,361,807.77\n- Average Total Assets = (Beginning Assets + Ending Assets) / 2 = ($13,000,000 + $15,086,049.65) / 2 = $14,043,024.83\n\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = $8,361,807.77 / $14,043,024.83 = 0.60\n\n## 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures a company's financial leverage.\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities = $3,428,090.41\n- Total Equity = $11,657,959.24\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $3,428,090.41 / $11,657,959.24 = 0.29\n\nNow, I'll format the answer according to the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"6.69\", \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-1.43\", \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.43\", \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.60\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.29\"}}\n```\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"6.69\", \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-1.43\", \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.43\", \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.60\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.29\"}}",
