This ratio measures the relationship between a company's operating cash flow and its net income.\n\nThe formula is: Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit (in absolute terms)\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,900,875.61\n- Net Profit = -1,342,040.76\n\nFor this ratio, I'll use the absolute values since both figures are negative:\n|Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities| / |Net Profit|\n= |−4,900,875.61| / |−1,342,040.76|\n= 4,900,875.61 / 1,342,040.76\n= 3.65\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places:\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = 3.65\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '3.65'}}\n```",
