                        "content": "I need to calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio, which measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables. The formula is:\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nLet me work through this step by step:\n\n1. First, I need to determine the Net Credit Sales. From the income statement, I can see:\n   - Main Business Revenue (Total Revenue) = $8,361,807.77\n\n2. Next, I need to calculate the Average Accounts Receivable:\n   - Beginning Accounts Receivable (from initial balance sheet) = $0\n   - Ending Accounts Receivable (from end balance sheet) = $2,498,141.24\n   - Average Accounts Receivable = ($0 + $2,498,141.24) / 2 = $1,249,070.62\n\n3. Now I can calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:\n   - Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $8,361,807.77 / $1,249,070.62 = 6.694\n\n4. Rounding to 2 decimal places: 6.69\n\nTherefore, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is 6.69.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '6.69'} }\n```",
