The Current Ratio is determined by dividing Total Current Assets by Total Current Liabilities.\n\nFrom the balance sheet, I can see:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount): $8,538,597.02\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount): $3,428,090.41\n\nNow I'll calculate the Current Ratio:\nCurrent Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\nCurrent Ratio = $8,538,597.02 / $3,428,090.41\nCurrent Ratio = 2.49075... (rounding to 2 decimal places) = 2.49\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '2.49'}}\n```",
