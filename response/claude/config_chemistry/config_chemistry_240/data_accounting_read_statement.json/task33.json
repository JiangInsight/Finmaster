The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period\n\nLooking at the income statement:\n\nFor the first value (income from core operating activities), this would typically be the \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue\". In this case, both show the same amount of 8361807.77.\n\nFor the second value (carrying amount of inventories sold), this would be the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" which is 6720000.00.\n\nBased on the example provided, these are the correct line items to extract.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '8361807.77', 'value2': '6720000.00'}}\n```",
