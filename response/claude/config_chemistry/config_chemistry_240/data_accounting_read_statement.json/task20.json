This is the standard accounting line item that captures the cost of inventory that has been sold to customers during the period.\n\nFrom the provided income statement, I can see:\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 6720000.00 (dated 2024-01-28)\n\nTherefore, the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is 6720000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '6720000.00'}}\n```",
