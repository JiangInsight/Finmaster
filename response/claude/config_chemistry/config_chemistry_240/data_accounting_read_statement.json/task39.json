However, the task asks for the reduction in assets held for sale, which would be the opposite of the reported figure.\n\nSince inventory has increased by 4,530,000.00, there is no reduction in inventory (assets held for sale) shown in this statement. However, per the task description, I need to extract the specific line item and its value, which is the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with the value \"-4530000.00\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-4530000.00'}}\n```",
