The task is asking specifically for expenses in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.\n\nIn a balance sheet, accumulated depreciation is an account that represents the total depreciation expense that has been recognized over time. Since depreciation is an expense that appears on the income statement, this is the most relevant line item that represents an expense.\n\nFrom the provided balance sheet:\n- Accumulated Depreciation had an initial value of 0.00 on 2023-12-31\n- Accumulated Depreciation had an end value of 45751.04 on 2024-01-28\n\nTherefore, the expense line item with its initial and end values is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '45751.04'}}\n```",
