Specifically, an increase in Accounts Payable represents additional amounts that the company owes to its suppliers for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement provided, I can see:\n- \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with a value of 3,010,000.00\n\nThis positive value indicates an increase in accounts payable, meaning the company has increased the amount it owes to suppliers during this period. This is precisely what we're looking for - the addition in the amount owed for goods or services received on credit.\n\nTherefore, the specific value of the addition in amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit is 3,010,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3010000.00'} }\n```",
