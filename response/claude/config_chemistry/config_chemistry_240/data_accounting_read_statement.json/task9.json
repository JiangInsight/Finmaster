This account represents taxes that have been recognized as a liability but have not yet been paid to the relevant tax authorities.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial value of \"Taxes Payable\" as of 2023-12-31: 0.00\n- End value of \"Taxes Payable\" as of 2024-01-28: 418090.41\n\nTherefore, the tax accrued but not yet paid started at 0.00 and ended at 418090.41.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '418090.41'}}\n```",
