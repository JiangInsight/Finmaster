First, I need to understand what line item would represent \"amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold.\" This would be accounts receivable.\n\n2. In a cash flow statement, an increase in accounts receivable is shown as a negative number (because it reduces cash), while a decrease is shown as a positive number.\n\n3. I see the line \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with a value of \"-2498141.24\". The negative sign indicates this is an increase in accounts receivable (not a decrease).\n\n4. Since the question asks for a decrease in amounts owed, and the value shows an increase (negative number), this is still the correct line item but it represents an increase rather than a decrease.\n\n5. The value associated with the \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" line is \"-2498141.24\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2498141.24'}}\n```",
