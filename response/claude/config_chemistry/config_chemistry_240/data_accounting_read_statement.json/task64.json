Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received/purchased on credit\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\n1. Balance Sheet:\n   - For capital contributed by shareholders: \"Paid-in Capital\" = 13000000.00\n   - For addition in amount owed: \"Accounts Payable\" = 3010000.00\n\n2. Income Statement:\n   - For profit/loss before tax: \"Profit Before Tax\" = -923950.35\n\n3. Cash Flow Statement:\n   - \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" = 3010000.00 confirms the accounts payable value\n\nThe three values I need to extract are:\n- Paid-in Capital (value1): 13000000.00\n- Profit Before Tax (value2): -923950.35\n- Accounts Payable (value3): 3010000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '-923950.35', 'value3': '3010000.00'}}\n```",
