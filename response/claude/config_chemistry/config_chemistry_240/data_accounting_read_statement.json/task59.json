Net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nLet me analyze each statement to find these values:\n\n### Balance Sheet\nLooking at the \"Interest Receivable\" line item, this represents interest that has been earned but not yet received. The end amount is $4,535.06.\n\n### Cash Flow Statement\nLooking at the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, the \"Net Increase\" shows the net addition in cash during the period, which is $-6,494,079.28 (a negative number indicating a decrease).\n\nThe \"Interest Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet ($4,535.06) and the \"Interest Income\" in the Income Statement ($4,535.06) match, confirming this is the interest accrued but not received.\n\nThe \"Net Increase\" in the Cash Flow Statement ($-6,494,079.28) shows the net change in cash during the period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '4535.06', 'value2': '-6494079.28'} }\n```",
