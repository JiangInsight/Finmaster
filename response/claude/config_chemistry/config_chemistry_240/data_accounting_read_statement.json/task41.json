When this value is positive in a cash flow statement, it indicates an increase in the amount of tax accrued but not yet paid during the period.\n\nSince the value is 418090.41, this is the specific amount of increase in tax accrued but not yet paid.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '418090.41'} }\n```",
