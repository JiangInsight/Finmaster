In the balance sheet: \"Taxes Payable\" with an End_amount of 418090.41 on 2024-01-28\n2. In the income statement: \"Tax Expense\" with an Amount of 418090.41 on 2024-01-28\n\nBoth values are identical, which is consistent because the tax expense recognized in the income statement creates the tax liability shown on the balance sheet.\n\nThe total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during this reporting period is 418090.41.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '418090.41'} }\n```",
