Cash on Hand: Initial amount = 3000000.00, End amount = 1379124.39\n2. Bank Deposits: Initial amount = 5000000.00, End amount = 126796.33\n\nBoth \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" represent liquid cash available for day-to-day operations. However, based on the example provided, the solution only considers \"Cash on Hand\" as the cash available for day-to-day operations.\n\nFollowing the same pattern as the example:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"3000000.00\", \"end value\": \"1379124.39\"}}\n```",
