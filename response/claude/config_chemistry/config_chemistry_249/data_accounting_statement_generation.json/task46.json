First, I'll identify the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period:\n   - Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n   - Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n\nThese initial deposit entries represent the beginning balance of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023. The fixed assets entry is not part of cash and cash equivalents.\n\nThe sum of these two items gives us the beginning cash and cash equivalents balance:\n3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 8,000,000.00\n\nThis is the amount that should appear as the beginning balance in the cash flow statement.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
