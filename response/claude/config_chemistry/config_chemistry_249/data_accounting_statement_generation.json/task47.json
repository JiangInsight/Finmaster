                        "content": "I need to calculate the ending cash and cash equivalents balance in the cash flow statement based on the transaction data. I'll track all cash and bank-related transactions to find the final balance.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the initial balances:\n- Initial cash deposit: $3,000,000.00\n- Initial bank deposit: $5,000,000.00\n- Total initial cash and cash equivalents: $8,000,000.00\n\nNext, I'll track all transactions that affect cash and bank balances:\n\n1. Cash inflows:\n   - Cash sales\n   - Bank to cash transfers\n   \n2. Cash outflows:\n   - Cash purchases\n   - Cash expenses\n   - Cash to bank transfers\n   - Fixed asset purchases paid with cash\n\n3. Bank inflows:\n   - Cash to bank transfers\n   \n4. Bank outflows:\n   - Bank purchases\n   - Fixed asset purchases paid with bank transfer\n   - Bank to cash transfers\n\nLet me analyze the transactions systematically:\n\nStarting with cash transactions:\n- Initial cash: $3,000,000.00\n- Cash purchases: -$2,460,000.00 (Purchase20231231002, Purchase20231231006, Purchase20231231008, Purchase20231231010, Purchase20231231012)\n- Cash expenses: -$2,603,348.53 (Sum of all expense transactions paid by cash)\n- Cash sales: +$2,429,539.06 (Sum of all sale transactions received by cash)\n- Bank to cash transfers: +$600,000.00 (Transfer20240109001, Transfer20240110001 x5, Transfer20240111001 x5, Transfer20240112001, Transfer20240113001, Transfer20240114001)\n- Cash to bank transfers: -$100,000.00 (Transfer20240128001)\n\nFor bank transactions:\n- Initial bank: $5,000,000.00\n- Bank purchases: -$3,290,000.00 (Purchase20231231001, Purchase20231231003, Purchase20231231007, Purchase20231231011)\n- Fixed asset purchases: -$666,078.18 (FixedAsset20231231001 x2)\n- Bank to cash transfers: -$600,000.00\n- Cash to bank transfers: +$100,000.00\n\nCalculating the ending cash balance:\n$3,000,000.00 - $2,460,000.00 - $2,603,348.53 + $2,429,539.06 + $600,000.00 - $100,000.00 = $866,190.53\n\nCalculating the ending bank balance:\n$5,000,000.00 - $3,290,000.00 - $666,078.18 - $600,000.00 + $100,000.00 = $543,921.82\n\nTotal ending cash and cash equivalents:\n$866,190.53 + $543,921.82 = $1,410,112.35\n\nDouble-checking this calculation, I notice some discrepancies. Let me recalculate more carefully by tracking each transaction that affects cash and bank balances.\n\nAfter a more detailed analysis of all cash flows:\n- Initial cash: $3,000,000.00\n- Initial bank: $5,000,000.00\n- Cash outflows (purchases, expenses): -$5,063,348.53\n- Cash inflows (sales): +$2,429,539.06\n- Bank outflows (purchases, fixed assets): -$3,956,078.18\n- Net transfers (bank to cash - cash to bank): +$500,000.00\n\nEnding cash balance: $866,190.53\nEnding bank balance: $543,921.82\nTotal ending balance: $1,410,112.35\n\nHowever, on closer inspection and more precise calculations, I determine the final ending cash and cash equivalents balance to be:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Ending Balance': '1410112.35'}}",
