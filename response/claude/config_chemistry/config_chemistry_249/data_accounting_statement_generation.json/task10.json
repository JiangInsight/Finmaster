                        "content": "I'll calculate the property, plant and non-current assets for the balance sheet, identifying both initial and final values.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the initial non-current assets\nLooking at the transactions data, I can see an initial fixed assets entry on 2023-12-31:\n```\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n```\n\nThis shows that the initial value of fixed assets (non-current assets) is 5,000,000.00.\n\n## Step 2: Find additional fixed asset purchases\nI need to identify any fixed asset purchases during the period. Looking through the data, I find:\n```\n| FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 362437.67 | 362437.67 |  |  | Paid | Bank Transfer |  | S003 | Supplier 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Storage Facilities4 | Storage Facilities |\n```\n\n```\n| FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 303640.51 | 303640.51 |  |  | Paid | Bank Transfer |  | S003 | Supplier 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Processing Equipment5 | Processing Equipment |\n```\n\nThese two fixed asset purchases total: 362,437.67 + 303,640.51 = 666,078.18\n\n## Step 3: Account for depreciation\nI need to subtract any depreciation recorded during the period:\n```\n| Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45748.2 | 45748.2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n```\n\n```\n| Depreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | 2024-02-01 | 2024-02-01 | 54491.689999999995 | 54491.689999999995 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n```\n\nTotal depreciation: 45,748.20 + 54,491.69 = 100,239.89\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final value\nThe final value of non-current assets would be:\nInitial value + Additions - Depreciation\n= 5,000,000.00 + 666,078.18 - 100,239.89\n= 5,565,838.29\n\n## Step 5: Double-check calculations\nLet me verify these calculations:\n- Initial fixed assets: 5,000,000.00\n- Added fixed assets: 666,078.18\n- Total depreciation: 100,239.89\n- Final value: 5,000,000.00 + 666,078.18 - 100,239.89 = 5,565,838.29\n\nActually, I should double-check my fixed asset purchases again to make sure I haven't missed any. After reviewing the data again, I confirm there are only two fixed asset purchases during the period for a total of 666,078.18.\n\nTherefore:\n- Total Non-current Assets Initial Value: 5,000,000.00\n- Total Non-current Assets End Value: 5,565,838.29\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '5565838.29'}}",
