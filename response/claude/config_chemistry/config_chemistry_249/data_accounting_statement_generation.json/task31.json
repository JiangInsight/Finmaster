Looking at the data, I can see entries with type \"Interest Receivables\" throughout January 2024.\n\nLet me collect all these interest transaction amounts:\n\nJanuary 1: 414.74\nJanuary 2: 361.34\nJanuary 3: 361.34\nJanuary 4: 361.34\nJanuary 5: 361.34\nJanuary 6: 361.34\nJanuary 7: 285.69\nJanuary 8: 285.69\nJanuary 9: 276.79\nJanuary 10: 227.04\nJanuary 11: 183.92\nJanuary 12: 175.02\nJanuary 13: 166.12\nJanuary 14: 157.22\nJanuary 15: 157.22\nJanuary 16: 157.22\nJanuary 17: 157.22\nJanuary 18: 157.22\nJanuary 19: 157.22\nJanuary 20: 59.32\nJanuary 21: 59.32\nJanuary 22: 59.32\nJanuary 23: 59.32\nJanuary 24: 27.07\nJanuary 25: 27.07\nJanuary 26: 27.07\nJanuary 27: 27.07\nJanuary 28: 8.94\nJanuary 29: 8.94\nJanuary 30: 8.94\nJanuary 31: 8.94\nFebruary 1: 8.94\n\nLet me sum up all these interest receivables amounts:\n414.74 + 361.34 + 361.34 + 361.34 + 361.34 + 361.34 + 285.69 + 285.69 + 276.79 + 227.04 + \n183.92 + 175.02 + 166.12 + 157.22 + 157.22 + 157.22 + 157.22 + 157.22 + 157.22 + 59.32 + \n59.32 + 59.32 + 59.32 + 27.07 + 27.07 + 27.07 + 27.07 + 8.94 + 8.94 + 8.94 + 8.94 + 8.94\n= 5,053.01\n\nNow, let me round this to 2 decimal places to represent the interest income:\n5,053.01 rounds to 5,053.01\n\nTherefore, the total interest income for the period is 5,053.01.\n\nHowever, let me verify this by double-checking the calculation with a different approach.\n\nLooking more carefully at the data, I noticed that all the \"Interest Receivables\" entries represent accrued interest for each day, not the cumulative total. So I should sum up all these daily interest accruals to get the total interest income.\n\nSumming all the \"Interest Receivables\" entries:\n414.74 + 361.34 + 361.34 + 361.34 + 361.34 + 361.34 + 285.69 + 285.69 + 276.79 + 227.04 + \n183.92 + 175.02 + 166.12 + 157.22 + 157.22 + 157.22 + 157.22 + 157.22 + 157.22 + 59.32 + \n59.32 + 59.32 + 59.32 + 27.07 + 27.07 + 27.07 + 27.07 + 8.94 + 8.94 + 8.94 + 8.94 + 8.94\n= 5,053.01\n\nTherefore, the total interest income for the period is 5,053.01.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Interest Income': '5053.01'}}",
