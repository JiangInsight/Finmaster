I'll work through this step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Identify revenue (sales)\nFirst, I'll identify all the sales transactions to calculate the total revenue.\n\nLooking at all rows with \"type\" = \"Sale\", I can find all the sales transactions. Each sale transaction includes the amount (revenue) generated.\n\n## Step 2: Identify cost of goods sold\nThe \"cost_amount\" column in the sales transactions represents the cost of goods sold.\n\n## Step 3: Identify expenses\nI need to identify all the expense transactions, including:\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Sales Expenses\n- Financial Expenses\n- Depreciation\n\n## Step 4: Calculate interest income\nThe interest receivables transactions represent interest income.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the net profit\nNet Profit = (Sales Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) + Interest Income - All Expenses\n\nLet me calculate each component:\n\n### Sales Revenue\nAdding up all the amounts from \"Sale\" type transactions = 5,877,050.78\n\n### Cost of Goods Sold\nAdding up all the \"cost_amount\" values from sales transactions = 4,870,000.00\n\n### Gross Profit\nGross Profit = Sales Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold = 5,877,050.78 - 4,870,000.00 = 1,007,050.78\n\n### Expenses\n- Administrative Expenses: 1,549,372.87\n- Sales Expenses: 422,778.27\n- Financial Expenses: 535,781.16\n- Depreciation: 100,239.89\n\nTotal Expenses = 2,608,172.19\n\n### Interest Income\nAdding up all the \"Interest Receivables\" amounts = 3,979.98\n\n### Net Profit Calculation\nNet Profit = Gross Profit + Interest Income - Total Expenses\nNet Profit = 1,007,050.78 + 3,979.98 - 2,608,172.19\nNet Profit = -1,597,141.43\n\nTherefore, the final net profit is -1,597,141.43, which represents a loss.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '-1597141.43'}}\n```",
