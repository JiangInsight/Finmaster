This is determined by examining the tax transactions in the dataset.\n\nStep 1: Identify tax-related transactions in the data.\nLooking at the columns, I can see the \"tax_amount\" column appears in sales transactions, showing the tax collected from customers.\n\nStep 2: Sum up all the tax amounts from sales transactions.\nI'll go through all the sales transactions and add up the tax_amount values.\n\nGoing through the data and adding up all tax_amount entries:\n- Row Sale20240103003: 8,337.84\n- Row Sale20240104004: 17,464.83\n- Row Sale20240105005: 2,212.51\n- Row Sale20240106006: 11,648.38\n- Row Sale20240106007: 27,961.38\n- Row Sale20240107009: 11,358.16\n- Row Sale20240108010: 14,560.65\n- Row Sale20240108011: 6,735.63\n- Row Sale20240109012: 28,087.63\n- Row Sale20240110013: 599.74\n- Row Sale20240110014: 11,285.31\n- Row Sale20240111016: 1,197.17\n- Row Sale20240112019: 1,175.53\n- Row Sale20240112020: 11,401.47\n- Row Sale20240113021: 5,761.37\n- Row Sale20240113022: 572.62\n- Row Sale20240114023: 15,207.24\n- Row Sale20240114024: 645.41\n- Row Sale20240115025: 12,598.91\n- Row Sale20240115026: 1,166.35\n- Row Sale20240116028: 6,296.39\n- Row Sale20240117029: 11,752.68\n- Row Sale20240117030: 2,393.63\n- Row Sale20240118032: 1,181.28\n- Row Sale20240119034: 2,081.40\n- Row Sale20240119035: 6,295.30\n- Row Sale20240120036: 27,828.12\n- Row Sale20240121038: 5,008.56\n- Row Sale20240122040: 14,316.86\n- Row Sale20240122041: 2,432.87\n- Row Sale20240123042: 13,434.57\n- Row Sale20240123043: 1,157.91\n- Row Sale20240124044: 645.19\n- Row Sale20240124045: 13,888.96\n- Row Sale20240125047: 12,262.37\n- Row Sale20240126048: 1,278.82\n- Row Sale20240129052: 13,224.89\n- Row Sale20240129053: 2,591.18\n- Row Sale20240130054: 6,113.34\n- Row Sale20240130055: 1,255.77\n- Row Sale20240131057: 6,416.86\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total tax payable based on the data.\nAdding all these values: 342,209.07\n\nThis represents the total tax collected during the period. Since these are taxes collected but not necessarily paid to the tax authority yet, they represent an increase in the tax payable liability.\n\nTherefore, the increase in tax payable for the period is $342,209.07.\n\nNote: In a real-world scenario, we would also need to consider any tax payments made to tax authorities during the period, which would reduce the tax payable. However, I don't see any specific tax payment transactions in the data, so I'm assuming all collected taxes are still payable.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '342209.07'} }\n```",
