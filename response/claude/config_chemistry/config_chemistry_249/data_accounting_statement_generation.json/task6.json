Cash and bank balances have decreased due to expenses and purchases\n2. Accounts receivable have built up from unpaid sales\n3. Inventory has increased from purchases minus sales\n4. Interest receivables have accumulated\n\nThe ending balance of current assets is calculated to be approximately 7,956,806.47.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Total Current Assets End Value': '7956806.47'} }\n```",
