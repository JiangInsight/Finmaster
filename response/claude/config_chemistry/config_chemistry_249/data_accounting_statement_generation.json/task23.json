Let me analyze the data step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Understand what transactions contribute to COGS\nCOGS represents the direct costs associated with producing goods that were sold during the period. In this case, I need to identify all sales transactions and sum up their associated cost amounts.\n\n## Step 2: Identify sale transactions and their cost amounts\nLooking through the data, I can see that all sale transactions have the type \"Sale\" and include a \"cost_amount\" field, which represents the cost of the goods that were sold.\n\n## Step 3: Extract and sum up the cost amounts from all sales transactions\nLet me go through all the \"Sale\" transactions and sum up their cost_amount values:\n\n- Sale20240103003: Cost amount = 150,000.00\n- Sale20240104004: Cost amount = 250,000.00\n- Sale20240105005: Cost amount = 40,000.00\n- Sale20240106006: Cost amount = 200,000.00\n- Sale20240106007: Cost amount = 500,000.00\n- Sale20240107009: Cost amount = 200,000.00\n- Sale20240108010: Cost amount = 250,000.00\n- Sale20240108011: Cost amount = 100,000.00\n- Sale20240109012: Cost amount = 500,000.00\n- Sale20240110013: Cost amount = 10,000.00\n- Sale20240110014: Cost amount = 200,000.00\n- Sale20240111016: Cost amount = 20,000.00\n- Sale20240112019: Cost amount = 20,000.00\n- Sale20240112020: Cost amount = 200,000.00\n- Sale20240113021: Cost amount = 100,000.00\n- Sale20240113022: Cost amount = 10,000.00\n- Sale20240114023: Cost amount = 250,000.00\n- Sale20240114024: Cost amount = 10,000.00\n- Sale20240115025: Cost amount = 200,000.00\n- Sale20240115026: Cost amount = 20,000.00\n- Sale20240116028: Cost amount = 100,000.00\n- Sale20240117029: Cost amount = 200,000.00\n- Sale20240117030: Cost amount = 40,000.00\n- Sale20240118032: Cost amount = 20,000.00\n- Sale20240119034: Cost amount = 30,000.00\n- Sale20240119035: Cost amount = 100,000.00\n- Sale20240120036: Cost amount = 500,000.00\n- Sale20240121038: Cost amount = 80,000.00\n- Sale20240122040: Cost amount = 250,000.00\n- Sale20240122041: Cost amount = 40,000.00\n- Sale20240123042: Cost amount = 200,000.00\n- Sale20240123043: Cost amount = 20,000.00\n- Sale20240124044: Cost amount = 10,000.00\n- Sale20240124045: Cost amount = 200,000.00\n- Sale20240125047: Cost amount = 200,000.00\n- Sale20240126048: Cost amount = 20,000.00\n- Sale20240129052: Cost amount = 200,000.00\n- Sale20240129053: Cost amount = 40,000.00\n- Sale20240130054: Cost amount = 100,000.00\n- Sale20240130055: Cost amount = 20,000.00\n- Sale20240131057: Cost amount = 100,000.00\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total COGS\nAdding up all these cost amounts:\nTotal COGS = 5,500,000.00\n\nTherefore, the final cost of goods sold item in the income statement is 5,500,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cost of Goods Sold': '5500000.00'} }\n```",
