This line represents the change in inventory during the period.\n\nThe negative value indicates an increase in inventory (more assets are being held), not a reduction. However, the task is asking for the value of the reduction in inventory. Since the inventory increased by 3,420,000.00, the reduction value would be the same amount but with a negative sign, which is already represented as \"-3420000.00\".\n\nTherefore, the value of the reduction in the amount of assets held for sale (inventory) is -3420000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-3420000.00'}}\n```",
