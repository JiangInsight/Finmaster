This represents the increase in taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid during the period.\n\nSince this is a positive number, it indicates an increase in tax payable, which means more taxes have been accrued than paid during the period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '341835.08'}}\n```",
