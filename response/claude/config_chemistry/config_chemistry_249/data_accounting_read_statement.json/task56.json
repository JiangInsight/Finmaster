In the balance sheet, I can see \"Accumulated Depreciation\" with an end amount of 100239.89 as of 2024-02-01.\n\n2. In the cash flow statement, I see \"Depreciation\" listed with an amount of 100239.89.\n\n3. In the income statement, there is a specific line item \"Depreciation\" with a value of 100239.89.\n\nThe systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life is precisely what depreciation represents. This appears consistently across all relevant sections of the financial statements as 100239.89.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item is \"Depreciation\" with the value of 100239.89.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"100239.89\"}}\n```",
