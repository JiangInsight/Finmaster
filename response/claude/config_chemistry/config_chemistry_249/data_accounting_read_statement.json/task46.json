Looking at the statement, I can see a section titled \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with a line item \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" showing a value of -666078.18.\n\nThis represents the net amount of cash generated from (or used in) the entity's investing activities, which typically include the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and investments.\n\nNow I need to decompose this into its component sub-items. In this statement, there is only one sub-item contributing to this value:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 666078.18\n\nThe Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities is negative (-666078.18) because the purchase of fixed assets represents a cash outflow.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-666078.18', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '666078.18'} }}\n```",
