Total Revenue: 6836701.10 (the starting point)\n2. Cost of Goods Sold: 5700000.00 (direct costs of producing goods)\n3. Total Expenses: 2835757.88 (all operating expenses)\n4. Interest Income: 5155.34 (additional income)\n5. Tax Expense: 341835.08 (final deduction before net profit)\n\nThe calculation flows as:\nTotal Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold = Gross Profit\nGross Profit - Total Expenses + Interest Income = Profit Before Tax\nProfit Before Tax - Tax Expense = Net Profit\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2035736.52', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '6836701.10', 'sub_item value2': '5700000.00', 'sub_item value3': '2835757.88', 'sub_item value4': '5155.34', 'sub_item value5': '341835.08'}}}\n```",
