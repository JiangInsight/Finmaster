The net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- I see \"Interest Receivable\" with an end amount of 5155.34. This represents interest accrued but not yet received.\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- I see \"Interest Income\" of 5155.34, which matches the interest receivable amount.\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- I see \"Net Increase\" in Cash and Cash Equivalents of -7522918.76. The negative sign indicates a decrease rather than an addition.\n\nThe values I need are:\n1. Interest accrued but not yet received: 5155.34\n2. Net addition in cash and cash equivalents: -7522918.76\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5155.34', 'value2': '-7522918.76'} }\n```",
