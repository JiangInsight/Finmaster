When accounts payable increases, it means the company has received goods or services but has not yet paid for them, essentially making purchases on credit.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement provided, I can see the line item:\n\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with a value of \"1260000.00\"\n\nSince this value is positive, it indicates an increase in accounts payable, which represents the addition to the amount owed for goods or services purchased on credit during the period.\n\nTherefore, the value I'm looking for is 1260000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1260000.00'}}\n```",
