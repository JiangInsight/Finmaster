Accounts Payable is generally the line item that represents amounts owed to suppliers for goods or services purchased on credit. This is what we're looking for.\n\n2. In the balance sheet, I can see \"Accounts Payable\" with:\n   - Initial amount: 0.00 on 2023-12-31\n   - End amount: 1260000.00 on 2024-02-01\n\nWhile \"Taxes Payable\" is also a liability, it specifically represents taxes owed rather than amounts owed for goods or services.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1260000.00'}}\n```",
