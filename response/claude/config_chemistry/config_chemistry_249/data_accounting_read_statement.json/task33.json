The carrying amount of inventories sold\n\nLooking at the income statement:\n\nFor income from core operating activities, this is typically represented by \"Main Business Revenue\" or similar terms - this refers to the company's primary revenue from its operations.\n- I see \"Main Business Revenue\" of 6836701.10\n\nFor the carrying amount of inventories sold, this is typically represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) - this represents the cost of inventory that has been sold during the period.\n- I see \"Cost of Goods Sold\" of 5700000.00\n\nTherefore:\n- value1 (income from core operating activities) = 6836701.10\n- value2 (carrying amount of inventories sold) = 5700000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '6836701.10', 'value2': '5700000.00'}}\n```",
