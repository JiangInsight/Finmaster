These are typically non-current assets.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet provided:\n\n1. The line item that represents non-current assets is \"Total Non-current Assets\"\n2. The initial value for Total Non-current Assets as of 2023-12-31 is 5000000.00\n3. The end value for Total Non-current Assets as of 2024-02-01 is 5565838.29\n\nThese non-current assets generally include fixed assets (less accumulated depreciation) and any other long-term investments or assets. In this balance sheet, we can see that the non-current assets consist of Fixed Assets (5666078.18) minus Accumulated Depreciation (100239.89), resulting in the Total Non-current Assets value of 5565838.29.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5565838.29'}}\n```",
