This means more money is now owed to the entity than before (i.e., the company has sold more goods/services on credit than it has collected payment for).\n\nSince the question asks for a decrease, and we have an increase (negative value), this is still the relevant figure but shows an increase rather than a decrease in amounts owed.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-3098023.69'}}\n```",
