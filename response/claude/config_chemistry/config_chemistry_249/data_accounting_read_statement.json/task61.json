Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets\n\nLet me analyze each statement:\n\nFrom the Income Statement, I can see \"Selling Expenses\" of $477,715.85. This typically represents costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services, including marketing, sales, and distribution expenses.\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement, I can see \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" of $666,078.18. This represents cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\nTherefore:\n- value1 = $477,715.85 (Selling Expenses)\n- value2 = $666,078.18 (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '477715.85', 'value2': '666078.18'}}\n```",
