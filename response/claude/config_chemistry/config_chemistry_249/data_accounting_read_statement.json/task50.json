The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life = Depreciation\n2. Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale (inventory) = (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\n3. Net amount of cash from investing activities = Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n4. Net addition in the amount of cash during the period = Net Increase\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement provided:\n\n1. Depreciation: $100,239.89\n2. (Increase) Decrease in Inventory: $-3,420,000.00\n3. Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: $-666,078.18\n4. Net Increase: $-7,522,918.76\n\nTherefore, my solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '100239.89', 'value2': '-3420000.00', 'value3': '-666078.18', 'value4': '-7522918.76'}}\n```",
