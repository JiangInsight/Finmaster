These are classified as current assets in the balance sheet.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet provided, I can see that \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of all current assets, which includes:\n- Cash on Hand\n- Bank Deposits\n- Interest Receivable\n- Accounts Receivable\n- Inventory\n\nThese assets are typically expected to be realized within one operating cycle or within one year, whichever is longer.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial value of Total Current Assets (2023-12-31): 8000000.00\n- End value of Total Current Assets (2024-02-01): 7000260.27\n\nTherefore, these are the values I need for my solution.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '7000260.27'}}\n```",
