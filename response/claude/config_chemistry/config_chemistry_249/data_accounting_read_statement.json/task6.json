These are typically categorized as \"Fixed Assets\" or \"Property, Plant and Equipment\" on a balance sheet.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet provided, I can see the line item \"Fixed Assets\" which represents tangible assets used in operations. These assets would include items like buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, and other physical assets used in the business.\n\nThe Fixed Assets line shows:\n- Initial value: 5000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- End value: 5666078.18 (as of 2024-02-01)\n\nNote that there's also an \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line which represents the cumulative depreciation charged against these fixed assets, but the task asks for the gross value of the tangible items, not the net value after depreciation.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5666078.18'}}\n```",
