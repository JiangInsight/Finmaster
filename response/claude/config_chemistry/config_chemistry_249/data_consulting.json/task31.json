Let me calculate each ratio step by step.\n\n1. **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio**:\n   - Formula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n   - Net Credit Sales = Main Business Revenue = $6,836,701.10\n   - Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning Accounts Receivable + Ending Accounts Receivable) / 2\n   - Beginning Accounts Receivable = $0\n   - Ending Accounts Receivable = $3,098,023.69\n   - Average Accounts Receivable = ($0 + $3,098,023.69) / 2 = $1,549,011.85\n   - Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $6,836,701.10 / $1,549,011.85 = 4.41\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**:\n   - Formula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$6,856,840.58\n   - Current Liabilities = $1,601,835.08\n   - Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -$6,856,840.58 / $1,601,835.08 = -4.28\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio**:\n   - This is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n   - Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -4.28\n\n4. **Total Asset Turnover Ratio**:\n   - Formula: Total Revenue / Average Total Assets\n   - Total Revenue = $6,836,701.10\n   - Average Total Assets = (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2\n   - Beginning Total Assets = $13,000,000.00\n   - Ending Total Assets = $12,566,098.56\n   - Average Total Assets = ($13,000,000.00 + $12,566,098.56) / 2 = $12,783,049.28\n   - Total Asset Turnover Ratio = $6,836,701.10 / $12,783,049.28 = 0.53\n\n5. **Debt to Equity Ratio**:\n   - Formula: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n   - Total Liabilities = $1,601,835.08\n   - Total Equity = $10,964,263.48\n   - Debt to Equity Ratio = $1,601,835.08 / $10,964,263.48 = 0.15\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"4.41\", \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-4.28\", \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-4.28\", \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.53\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.15\"}}\n```",
