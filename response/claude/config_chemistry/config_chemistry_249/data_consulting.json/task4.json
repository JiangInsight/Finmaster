Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $1,601,835.08\n   (There appear to be no non-current liabilities listed)\n\n2. Total Owner's Equity = $10,964,263.48\n\n3. Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n   = $1,601,835.08 / $10,964,263.48\n   = 0.1461 (rounded to 2 decimal places: 0.15)\n\nTherefore, the Debt to Equity Ratio is 0.15.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15'}}\n```",
