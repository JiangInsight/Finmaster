                        "content": "I'll calculate each of these financial ratios step by step based on the provided financial statements.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis ratio measures the company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from operations.\n- Operating Cash Flow = -6,856,840.58 (from cash flow statement)\n- Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08 (from balance sheet)\n- Ratio = -6,856,840.58 / 1,601,835.08 = -4.28\n\n## 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures the company's financial leverage.\n- Total Liabilities = 1,601,835.08 (from balance sheet)\n- Total Equity = 10,964,263.48 (from balance sheet)\n- Ratio = 1,601,835.08 / 10,964,263.48 = 0.146\n\n## 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n- Revenue = 6,836,701.10 (from income statement)\n- Total Assets = 12,566,098.56 (from balance sheet)\n- Ratio = 6,836,701.10 / 12,566,098.56 = 0.544\n\n## 4. Quick Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n- Quick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 7,000,260.27 - 3,420,000.00 = 3,580,260.27\n- Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08\n- Ratio = 3,580,260.27 / 1,601,835.08 = 2.23\n\n## 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow generated from operations.\n- This is the same as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -4.28\n\n## 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\nThis measures the company's profitability by revealing how much profit it generates with the money shareholders have invested.\n- Net Income = -2,035,736.52 (from income statement)\n- Total Equity = 10,964,263.48 (from balance sheet)\n- ROE = (-2,035,736.52 / 10,964,263.48) Ã— 100% = -18.57%\n\n## 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company collects revenue and uses its assets.\n- Revenue = 6,836,701.10 (from income statement)\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 3,098,023.69) / 2 = 1,549,011.85\n- Ratio = 6,836,701.10 / 1,549,011.85 = 4.41\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-4.28', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.54', 'Quick Ratio': '2.23', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-4.28', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '-18.57%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '4.41'} }\n```",
