Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -$6,856,840.58\n2. Capital Expenditures (Purchase of Fixed Assets): $666,078.18\n\nNow I can calculate the FCF:\nFCF = -$6,856,840.58 - $666,078.18 = -$7,522,918.76\n\nI can verify this calculation by looking at the \"Net Increase\" in Cash and Cash Equivalents, which is also -$7,522,918.76. This confirms my calculation is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-7522918.76'}}\n```",
