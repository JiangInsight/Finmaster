                        "content": "I'll calculate the requested financial ratios using the provided statements. Let me work through each ratio step by step.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis measures the company's ability to cover current liabilities with operating cash flows.\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$6,856,840.58\n- Total Current Liabilities = $1,601,835.08\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -6,856,840.58 ÷ 1,601,835.08 = -4.28\n\n## 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nThis measures the company's ability to repay its debt using operating cash flow.\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$6,856,840.58\n- Total Current Liabilities = $1,601,835.08 (assuming this is the total debt)\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -6,856,840.58 ÷ 1,601,835.08 = -4.28\n\n## 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently inventory is managed.\n- Cost of Goods Sold = $5,700,000.00\n- Average Inventory = (0 + 3,420,000.00) ÷ 2 = $1,710,000.00\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = 5,700,000.00 ÷ 1,710,000.00 = 3.33\n\n## 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures the company's financial leverage.\n- Total Liabilities = $1,601,835.08\n- Total Owner's Equity = $10,964,263.48\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = 1,601,835.08 ÷ 10,964,263.48 = 0.15\n\n## 5. Quick Ratio\nThis measures the company's ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n- Current Assets excluding Inventory = $7,000,260.27 - $3,420,000.00 = $3,580,260.27\n- Current Liabilities = $1,601,835.08\n- Quick Ratio = 3,580,260.27 ÷ 1,601,835.08 = 2.24\n\n## 6. Current Ratio\nThis measures the company's ability to pay short-term obligations.\n- Total Current Assets = $7,000,260.27\n- Current Liabilities = $1,601,835.08\n- Current Ratio = 7,000,260.27 ÷ 1,601,835.08 = 4.37\n\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-4.28', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-4.28', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '3.33', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Quick Ratio': '2.24', 'Current Ratio': '4.37'}}",
