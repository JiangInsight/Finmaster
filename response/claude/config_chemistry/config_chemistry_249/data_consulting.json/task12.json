ROE measures how efficiently a company uses its equity to generate profits.\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\nROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity × 100%\n\nStep 1: Identify the Net Income from the income statement.\nNet Income = -$2,035,736.52\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Average Shareholders' Equity.\nBeginning Shareholders' Equity (Initial) = $13,000,000.00\nEnding Shareholders' Equity (End) = $10,964,263.48\nAverage Shareholders' Equity = ($13,000,000.00 + $10,964,263.48) / 2 = $11,982,131.74\n\nStep 3: Calculate ROE.\nROE = -$2,035,736.52 / $11,982,131.74 × 100% = -16.99%\n\nTherefore, the Return on Equity (ROE) is -16.99%, indicating that the company is currently generating negative returns on its equity.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '-16.99%'}}\n```",
