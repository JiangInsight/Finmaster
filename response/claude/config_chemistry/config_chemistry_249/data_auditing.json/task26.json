In the recorded data, the category is \"Sale\" but the invoice describes it as \"Administrative Expenses\"\n2. The recorded date is \"2024-01-20\" but the invoice states \"January 10, 2024\"\n3. The recorded amount is $16,424.69 but the invoice mentions $14,554.64\n\nThe invoice says: \"On January 10, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Administrative Expenses, totaling $14554.64. The payment_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid. This transaction was prepared by Staff, and the approver is Director.\"\n\nSince the invoice is considered more reliable, these represent errors in the recorded information.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Administrative Expenses', 'Recorded category': 'Sale', 'Original date': '2024-01-10', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-20', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '14554.64', 'Recorded amount': '16424.69', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240110001'} }\n```",
