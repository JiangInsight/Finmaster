Compare field values with the invoice text (which is generally more reliable)\n2. Check for mathematical inconsistencies (calculations)\n3. Look for logical inconsistencies in related fields\n\nStarting my analysis by looking at each transaction row and examining the invoice description...\n\nWhen reviewing Expense20240122001 for \"Administrative Expenses\", I notice:\n- Recorded amount: 33506.89\n- Invoice states: \"totaling $28867.32\"\n- Recorded payment status: \"Unpaid\"\n- Invoice states: \"this transaction was paid\"\n\nThis transaction shows clear inconsistencies between the recorded fields and the invoice.\n\nSimilarly, looking at all other transactions, I find another discrepancy with Expense20240130001 for \"Administrative Expenses\":\n- Recorded amount: 37712.10\n- Invoice states: \"totaling $32705.96\"\n- Recorded payment status: \"Unpaid\"\n- Invoice states: \"this transaction was paid\"\n\nThese inconsistencies are particularly notable because invoices are considered more reliable due to their standardized nature.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"28867.32\", \"Recorded amount\": \"33506.89\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Expense20240122001\"} }\n```",
