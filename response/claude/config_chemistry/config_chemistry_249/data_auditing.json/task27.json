I'll focus particularly on the invoice field, which is considered more reliable.\n\nLet me examine the transactions one by one:\n\nFor transaction ID \"Sale20240129053\", I notice several inconsistencies:\n1. The transaction type is recorded as \"Sales Expenses\" but the ID starts with \"Sale\" and the invoice description indicates it's a sale transaction\n2. The unit price in the invoice description is $12,955.91, but the recorded_unit_price is $10,444.96\n3. The total amount in the invoice description is $51,823.64, but the recorded_amount is $54,888.41\n4. All other calculations in the invoice description (cost amount, tax amount, after tax amount, profit) align with the original amount of $51,823.64, not the recorded amount\n\nLooking at the invoice field, which is more reliable:\n\"On January 29, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 4.0 units at a unit price of $12955.91, totaling $51823.64. The cost amount for this transaction was $40000.00, with a tax amount of $2591.18, leading to a total amount due of $49232.46. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nThis clearly indicates this should be a \"Sale\" transaction with a total amount of $51,823.64 and a unit price of $12,955.91.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '12955.91', 'Recorded price': '10444.96', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '51823.64', 'Recorded amount': '54888.41', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240129053'} }",
