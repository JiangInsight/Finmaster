This appears to be an error in the recorded tax amount.\n\nI've also reviewed the transaction \"Purchase20231231001\" but all fields are consistent between the recorded values and what's stated in the invoice.\n\nSimilarly for Sale20240130054, the invoice confirms a tax amount of $6,113.34, but the recorded value is $134,717.50, which is clearly incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': None, 'Recorded category': None, 'Original date': None, 'Recorded date': None, 'Original payment/receipt_status': None, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': None, 'Original payment_method': None, 'Recorded payment_method': None, 'Original quantity': None, 'Recorded quantity': None, 'Original price': None, 'Recorded price': None, 'Original receive_method': None, 'Recorded receive_method': None, 'Original amount': None, 'Recorded amount': None, 'Original tax': '6113.34', 'Recorded tax': '134717.5', 'Original profit': None, 'Recorded profit': None, 'Original Preparer': None, 'Recorded Preparer': None, 'Original Approver': None, 'Recorded Approver': None, 'id': 'Sale20240130054'} }\n```",
