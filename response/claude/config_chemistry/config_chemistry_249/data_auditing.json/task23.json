The recorded date (2024-01-11) doesn't match the date mentioned in the invoice (2024-01-10)\n2. The recorded amount ($241310.1) doesn't match the amount calculated from the unit price and quantity in the invoice ($225706.12)\n\nLooking at the other transactions, I should check Purchase20231231001 as well:\n\nTransaction ID: Purchase20231231001\n- Recorded amount: 340000.0\n- Calculated amount from invoice: 17 units × $20000.0 unit price = $340000.0\n- Recorded payment status: Paid\n- Invoice payment status: \"...this transaction was paid\"\n- Recorded payment method: Bank Transfer\n- Invoice payment method: \"...bank transfer\"\n\nThis transaction appears consistent.\n\nI'm not finding any other clear inconsistencies in the data when comparing the recorded fields to the invoice information. The only transaction with clear inconsistencies is Sale20240110014.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-10', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-11', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '225706.12', 'Recorded amount': '241310.1', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': '25706.12', 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240110014'} }\n```",
