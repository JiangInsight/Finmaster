Expense20240101001: Recorded payment method is \"Bank Transfer\" but should be \"Cash\" according to invoice\n2. Expense20240121001: Recorded payment method is \"Account Payable\" but should be \"Cash\" according to invoice\n\nSince the task specifically asks for the incorrect fields, their recorded values, and best estimate of the correct values, I'll provide this for Expense20240101001:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original payment_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Bank Transfer\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"id\": \"Expense20240101001\"}}\n```",
