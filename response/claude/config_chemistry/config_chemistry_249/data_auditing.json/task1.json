The transaction ID begins with \"Interest\" suggesting it should be an Interest Receivables transaction\n2. The recorded_type is \"Purchase\" which doesn't match the naming convention of the ID\n3. Looking at the invoice description: \"On January 22, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Interest Receivables, totaling $59.32. The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n4. The invoice clearly states this is an Interest Receivables transaction, not a Purchase\n\nThis is a clear mismatch between the recorded transaction type and what it should be based on both the ID pattern and the invoice information.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Interest Receivables\", \"Recorded category\": \"Purchase\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Interest20240122022\"}}\n```",
