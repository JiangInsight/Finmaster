The invoice is generally more reliable as it's a standardized, official document.\n\nLet me analyze some key transactions:\n\n## Transaction: Sale20240130057\nLooking at this transaction:\n- Recorded date: 2024-02-01\n- Recorded amount: $90,992.35\n- Recorded unit price: $21,750.10\n- Invoice says: \"On January 30, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 3.0 units at a unit price of $24766.75, totaling $74300.25.\"\n\nThis shows several discrepancies:\n1. Date: Invoice says January 30, but record shows February 1\n2. Price: Invoice shows $24,766.75 per unit, record shows $21,750.10\n3. Total amount: Invoice says $74,300.25, record shows $90,992.35\n\n## Transaction: Sale20240129052\nAnother transaction with discrepancies:\n- Recorded date: 2024-01-31\n- Recorded amount: $323,059.25\n- Recorded unit price: $158,539.06\n- Invoice says: \"On January 29, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $132248.88, totaling $264497.76.\"\n\nDiscrepancies:\n1. Date: Invoice says January 29, record shows January 31\n2. Price: Invoice shows $132,248.88 per unit, record shows $158,539.06\n3. Total amount: Invoice says $264,497.76, record shows $323,059.25\n\nSince the invoice is considered more reliable, I'll provide the original (correct) values from the invoice and the recorded (incorrect) values from the data fields.\n\nFor Sale20240129052:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-29', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-31', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '132248.88', 'Recorded price': '158539.06', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '264497.76', 'Recorded amount': '323059.25', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240129052'} }\n```",
