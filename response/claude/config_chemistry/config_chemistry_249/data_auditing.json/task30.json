The recorded_type is \"Depreciation\" but the invoice clearly describes a Sale transaction: \"On January 10, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $11994.85...\"\n\n2. The recorded_amount is $13613.10, but the invoice states the total should be $11994.85 (unit price Ã— quantity).\n\n3. The recorded_unit_price is $13939.19, but the invoice states it should be $11994.85.\n\n4. The recorded_tax_amount is $11960.08, which is extremely high (about 88% of the sale amount). The invoice states it should be $599.74 (5% of the sale amount).\n\n5. The after_tax_amount in the invoice is $11395.11, which confirms that the tax should be $599.74.\n\nThese discrepancies indicate significant errors in the recorded data compared to what's stated in the invoice description, which is generally considered more reliable.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Depreciation', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '11994.85', 'Recorded price': '13939.19', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '11994.85', 'Recorded amount': '13613.1', 'Original tax': '599.74', 'Recorded tax': '11960.08', 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240110013'} }\n```",
