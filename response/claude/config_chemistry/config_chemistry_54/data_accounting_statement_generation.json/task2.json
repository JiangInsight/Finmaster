6,196,972.73 + 1,300,000.00 = 103,027.27\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious about possible duplicate entries. Looking at the fixed asset entries, I notice they have the same ID \"FixedAsset20231231001\" despite being for different suppliers and amounts. I'll need to count each of these as separate transactions.\n\nRecounting the bank outflows to ensure no duplications:\nBank outflows total: 6,196,972.73\n\nTherefore, the final bank deposit value is:\n5,000,000.00 - 6,196,972.73 + 1,300,000.00 = 103,027.27\n\nLet me round this to two decimal places: 103,027.27\n\nActually, I should double-check my understanding of the fixed asset entries. Upon closer inspection, these appear to be separate transactions for different assets (one for Storage Facilities4, one for Chemical Production Line5, etc.), so it's correct to count them all individually.\n\nTherefore, my calculation of the final bank deposit value of 103,027.27 is accurate.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Bank Deposits Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Bank Deposits End Value': '103027.27'}}",
