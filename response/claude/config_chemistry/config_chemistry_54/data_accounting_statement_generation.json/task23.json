In the data, sales transactions are those with \"type\" equal to \"Sale\".\n\n## Step 2: Extract the cost amounts from each sale\nFor each sale transaction, I'll look at the \"cost_amount\" column, which represents the cost of the goods that were sold in that transaction.\n\n## Step 3: Sum up all cost amounts\nLet me go through each sales transaction and add up the cost_amount values:\n\nFor transactions of type \"Sale\":\n- Sale20240102003: cost_amount = 50,000.00\n- Sale20240102004: cost_amount = 150,000.00\n- Sale20240103006: cost_amount = 80,000.00\n- Sale20240103007: cost_amount = 100,000.00\n- Sale20240104008: cost_amount = 40,000.00\n- Sale20240105009: cost_amount = 200,000.00\n- Sale20240105010: cost_amount = 20,000.00\n- Sale20240106012: cost_amount = 60,000.00\n- Sale20240106013: cost_amount = 150,000.00\n- Sale20240107015: cost_amount = 150,000.00\n- Sale20240107016: cost_amount = 40,000.00\n- Sale20240108018: cost_amount = 250,000.00\n- Sale20240108019: cost_amount = 20,000.00\n- Sale20240109020: cost_amount = 20,000.00\n- Sale20240109021: cost_amount = 50,000.00\n- Sale20240110023: cost_amount = 150,000.00\n- Sale20240111024: cost_amount = 200,000.00\n- Sale20240112025: cost_amount = 20,000.00\n- Sale20240113027: cost_amount = 30,000.00\n- Sale20240114028: cost_amount = 100,000.00\n- Sale20240114029: cost_amount = 80,000.00\n- Sale20240115031: cost_amount = 40,000.00\n- Sale20240115032: cost_amount = 500,000.00\n- Sale20240116034: cost_amount = 60,000.00\n- Sale20240117035: cost_amount = 80,000.00\n- Sale20240117036: cost_amount = 400,000.00\n- Sale20240118038: cost_amount = 50,000.00\n- Sale20240118039: cost_amount = 250,000.00\n- Sale20240119041: cost_amount = 40,000.00\n- Sale20240120042: cost_amount = 20,000.00\n- Sale20240120043: cost_amount = 50,000.00\n- Sale20240121044: cost_amount = 10,000.00\n- Sale20240122045: cost_amount = 500,000.00\n- Sale20240123047: cost_amount = 80,000.00\n- Sale20240123048: cost_amount = 250,000.00\n- Sale20240124050: cost_amount = 500,000.00\n- Sale20240125052: cost_amount = 40,000.00\n- Sale20240126054: cost_amount = 400,000.00\n- Sale20240127055: cost_amount = 150,000.00\n- Sale20240128057: cost_amount = 100,000.00\n- Sale20240129058: cost_amount = 100,000.00\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total COGS\nAdding all these cost_amount values:\nTotal COGS = 5,380,000.00\n\n## Verification\nTo double-check my calculation, I've ensured that I've captured all sales transactions, and for each one, I've included the cost_amount in my sum.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cost of Goods Sold': '5380000.00'} }\n```",
