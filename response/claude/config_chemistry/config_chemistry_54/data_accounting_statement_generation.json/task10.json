                        "content": "I need to calculate the property, plant and non-current assets from the transactions data, showing both initial and final values.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the initial non-current assets\nLooking at the initial transactions, I can see:\n- Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0\n\nThis gives us the beginning balance of non-current assets.\n\n## Step 2: Find all fixed asset purchases during the period\nI need to identify all fixed asset additions from the transactions data:\n\n1. FixedAsset20231231001 | Storage Facilities4 | Storage Facilities | 230120.87\n2. FixedAsset20231231001 | Chemical Production Line5 | Chemical Production Line | 478737.63\n3. FixedAsset20231231001 | Processing Equipment6 | Processing Equipment | 351585.3\n4. FixedAsset20231231001 | Processing Equipment7 | Processing Equipment | 386528.93\n\nTotal fixed asset additions: 230120.87 + 478737.63 + 351585.3 + 386528.93 = 1,446,972.73\n\n## Step 3: Identify depreciation during the period\nThere is one depreciation entry:\n- Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 45742.5\n\nThis is the amount by which non-current assets were reduced due to depreciation.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the end value of non-current assets\nInitial value + New purchases - Depreciation = End value\n5,000,000.00 + 1,446,972.73 - 45,742.5 = 6,401,230.23\n\n## Step 5: Double-check for other asset-related transactions\nLooking through the rest of the transactions, I don't see any disposals or other transactions that would affect the non-current assets balance.\n\n## Final calculation:\n- Total Non-current Assets Initial Value: 5,000,000.00\n- Total Non-current Assets End Value: 6,401,230.23\n\nWait, I need to verify this calculation. Let me recheck the fixed asset additions:\n\n1. FixedAsset20231231001 | Storage Facilities4 | Storage Facilities | 230120.87\n2. FixedAsset20231231001 | Chemical Production Line5 | Chemical Production Line | 478737.63\n3. FixedAsset20231231001 | Processing Equipment6 | Processing Equipment | 351585.3\n4. FixedAsset20231231001 | Processing Equipment7 | Processing Equipment | 386528.93\n\nTotal: 1,446,972.73\n\nFinal calculation:\n- Initial value: 5,000,000.00\n- Plus additions: 1,446,972.73\n- Less depreciation: 45,742.50\n- End value: 6,401,230.23\n\nActually, I need to be careful here. Let me double-check if these asset purchases are all from the same period or if any were included in the initial value. Since they all have the date 2023-12-31, they may be part of the initial value already.\n\nLooking at the transaction IDs, they appear to be new purchases separate from the initial balance. However, since they have the same date as the initial balance (2023-12-31), I should consider whether these are already included in the \"Fixed Assets\" initial value.\n\nUpon closer examination of the problem structure, I believe these are separate purchases made on the same date as the initial balance was established, so they should be added to the initial value.\n\nTherefore:\n- Total Non-current Assets Initial Value: 5,000,000.00\n- Total Non-current Assets End Value: 6,401,230.23\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '6401230.23'}}",
