The depreciation entries would typically be identified with the transaction type \"Depreciation\".\n\nStep 1: Search for transactions with type \"Depreciation\".\nI can see that there is one transaction with the type \"Depreciation\":\n- ID: Depreciation20240101001\n- Type: Depreciation\n- Date: 2024-01-01\n- Amount: 45742.5\n\nStep 2: Check if there are any other depreciation-related transactions.\nNo other transactions are explicitly marked as depreciation in the transaction data.\n\nStep 3: Determine the final depreciation value.\nSince there is only one depreciation transaction, the final depreciation amount is 45742.5.\n\nThe depreciation amount of 45742.5 will be included as an expense in the income statement.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45742.5'}}\n```",
