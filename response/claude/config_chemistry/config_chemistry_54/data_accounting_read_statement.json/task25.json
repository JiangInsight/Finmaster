Cost of Goods Sold - these are direct costs of producing goods or services\n2. Selling Expenses - these are costs related to marketing, sales, and distribution\n\nLooking at the income statement provided:\n\n1. Cost of Goods Sold: 5,580,000.00 - This represents the direct costs of producing the goods sold\n2. Selling Expenses: 630,420.28 - This represents costs related to sales, marketing, and distribution\n\nThe task specifically asks for costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services. That's precisely what \"Selling Expenses\" represents in an income statement - costs associated with securing orders (marketing, sales) and delivering products/services to customers.\n\nLooking at the example, \"Selling Expenses\" (493,854.67) was the correct answer, so I should focus on the same line item in the current problem.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '630420.28'}}\n```",
