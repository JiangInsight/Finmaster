Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities (from Cash Flow Statement)\n2. Taxes accrued but not yet paid (from Balance Sheet) \n3. Total income arising from ordinary activities (from Income Statement)\n\nLet me examine each financial statement carefully.\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- The \"Taxes Payable\" line item shows the taxes accrued but not yet paid: 346025.72\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- The \"Total Revenue\" line item represents the total income arising from ordinary activities: 6920513.79\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- The \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" line item shows the net cash generated from operating activities: -5714107.45\n\nTherefore, the three values I need to extract are:\n1. value1 (Taxes Payable): 346025.72\n2. value2 (Total Revenue): 6920513.79\n3. value3 (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities): -5714107.45\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '346025.72', 'value2': '6920513.79', 'value3': '-5714107.45'} }\n```",
