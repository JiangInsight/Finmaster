In accounting, this would typically be represented by \"Accounts Payable\" on the balance sheet.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Accounts Payable starting balance (Initial_amount): 0.00 on 2023-12-31\n- Accounts Payable ending balance (End_amount): 2,390,000.00 on 2024-01-31\n\nThe increase in Accounts Payable from 0.00 to 2,390,000.00 represents the net addition in amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\nThis is also confirmed in the cash flow statement, where \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is listed as 2,390,000.00.\n\nTherefore, the value of the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is 2,390,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2390000.00'} }\n```",
