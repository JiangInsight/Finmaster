This represents the amount that shareholders have invested in the company in exchange for shares.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Paid-in Capital: 13000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- End Paid-in Capital: 13000000.00 (as of 2024-01-31)\n\nThis shows that the shareholders contributed $13,000,000 initially, and this amount remained unchanged by the end of the period. There were no additional capital contributions or withdrawals during this time.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
