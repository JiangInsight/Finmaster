This means the company invested more money into inventory during this period.\n\nSince the question asks for the value of reduction in assets held for sale (inventory), and the value shows an increase rather than a reduction, the answer is \"-3900000.00\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-3900000.00'} }\n```",
