The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is -1446972.73\n2. The only component contributing to this is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of 1446972.73 (positive value in the statement, but it represents cash outflow)\n\nThe negative sign in the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" indicates a net cash outflow, which makes sense since purchasing fixed assets requires spending cash.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1446972.73', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '1446972.73'}}}\n```",
