In the balance sheet, there's a line item \"Taxes Payable\" with the value of 346025.72 as of 2024-01-31.\n\n2. In the cash flow statement, there's a line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with the value of 346025.72.\n\n3. Most importantly, in the income statement, there's a specific line item \"Tax Expense\" with the value of 346025.72 for the period ending 2024-01-31.\n\nThe \"Tax Expense\" line item in the income statement directly represents the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period. This is the most appropriate figure to extract for this task.\n\nTherefore, the value of the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay is 346025.72.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '346025.72'}}\n```",
