An increase in accounts receivable means more money is owed to the company (negative cash flow), while a decrease means more customers paid their debts (positive cash flow).\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement provided, I can see the line item:\n\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with a value of \"-2923459.19\"\n\nThe negative value indicates this is an increase in accounts receivable (more money owed to the company), which represents a decrease in cash.
