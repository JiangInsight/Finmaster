In accounting, expenses are often reflected in contra-asset accounts (like Accumulated Depreciation) or reductions in equity (like negative Retained Earnings).\n\nIn this balance sheet, I can see:\n1. Accumulated Depreciation: starting at 0.00 on 2023-12-31 and ending at 45742.50 on 2024-01-31\n2. Retained Earnings: starting at 0.00 on 2023-12-31 and ending at -1669849.77 on 2024-01-31\n\nBased on the example provided, it appears that \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is the expense item I need to extract, as it was the solution in the example.\n\nThe Accumulated Depreciation:\n- Initial value: 0.00 (on 2023-12-31)\n- End value: 45742.50 (on 2024-01-31)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '45742.50'}}\n```",
