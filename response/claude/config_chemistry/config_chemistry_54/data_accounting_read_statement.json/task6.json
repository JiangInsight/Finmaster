These are precisely the types of assets described in the task - tangible items used for production, services, rental, or administration.\n\nThe balance sheet shows:\n- Fixed Assets initial value: 5000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- Fixed Assets end value: 6446972.73 (as of 2024-01-31)\n\nNote that while there is also \"Accumulated Depreciation\" which relates to fixed assets, the task asks for the value of the tangible items themselves, not their depreciated value.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '6446972.73'}}\n```",
