                        "content": "I need to calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio for this company. This ratio measures a company's ability to repay its debt using its operating cash flow.\n\nThe formula for Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nStep 1: Identify the Operating Cash Flow.\nFrom the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is -$5,714,107.45.\n\nStep 2: Determine the Total Debt.\nFrom the balance sheet, the Total Current Liabilities is $2,736,025.72. There don't appear to be any long-term liabilities shown, so this represents the total debt.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio.\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -$5,714,107.45 / $2,736,025.72 = -2.09\n\nStep 4: Round to two decimal places.\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -2.09\n\nThe negative ratio indicates that the company is not generating positive cash flow from its operations to cover its debt. In fact, its operations are consuming cash rather than generating it.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.09'} }\n```",
