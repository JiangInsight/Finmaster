                        "content": "I'll solve this step by step, calculating the three required financial ratios based on the given statements.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nThis ratio measures the relationship between operating cash flow and net income.\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Net Income (absolute value)\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -5,714,107.45\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = -1,669,849.77\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = |-5,714,107.45| / |-1,669,849.77| = 5,714,107.45 / 1,669,849.77 = 3.42\n\n## 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio (also called Turnover Ratio)\n\nThis measures how efficiently a company is using its current assets to generate revenue.\nFormula: Total Revenue / Average Current Assets\n\n- Total Revenue = 6,920,513.79\n- Initial Current Assets = 8,000,000.00\n- End Current Assets = 7,664,945.72\n- Average Current Assets = (8,000,000.00 + 7,664,945.72) / 2 = 7,832,472.86\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = 6,920,513.79 / 7,832,472.86 = 0.88\n\n## 3. Quick Ratio\n\nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory.\nFormula: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\n- Current Assets = 7,664,945.72\n- Inventory = 3,900,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 2,736,025.72\n\nQuick Ratio = (7,664,945.72 - 3,900,000.00) / 2,736,025.72 = 3,764,945.72 / 2,736,025.72 = 1.38\n\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '3.42', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.88', 'Quick Ratio': '1.38'}}",
