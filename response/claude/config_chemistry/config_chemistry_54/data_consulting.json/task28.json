Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = $2,736,025.72 (Total Current Liabilities)\n- Total Assets = $14,066,175.95\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = $2,736,025.72 / $14,066,175.95 = 0.1945 ≈ 0.19\n\n2. Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = $1,340,513.79\n- Total Revenue = $6,920,513.79\n\nGross Profit Margin = ($1,340,513.79 / $6,920,513.79) × 100% = 19.37%\n\n3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$5,714,107.45\n- Total Current Liabilities = $2,736,025.72\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$5,714,107.45 / $2,736,025.72 = -2.09\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.19', 'Gross Profit Margin': '19.37%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.09'} }\n```",
