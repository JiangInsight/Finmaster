                        "content": "I need to calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio, which is defined as the ratio of net operating cash flow to current liabilities.\n\nFirst, let me identify the required values from the financial statements:\n\n1. Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -5,714,107.45 (from cash flow statement)\n2. Total Current Liabilities: 2,736,025.72 (from balance sheet)\n\nThe Operating Cash Flow Ratio is calculated as:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -5,714,107.45 / 2,736,025.72 = -2.088\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -2.09\n\nTherefore, the company's Operating Cash Flow Ratio is -2.09, which indicates that the company is not generating enough cash from operations to cover its short-term liabilities. In fact, its operations are consuming cash rather than generating it.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.09'} }\n```",
