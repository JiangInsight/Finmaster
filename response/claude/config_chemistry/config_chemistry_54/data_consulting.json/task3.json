Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $2,736,025.72\n   (There are no non-current liabilities listed, so total liabilities equals current liabilities)\n\n2. Total Assets = $14,066,175.95\n   (This is explicitly stated in the balance sheet)\n\n3. Debt to Asset Ratio = $2,736,025.72 รท $14,066,175.95 = 0.1945\n\n4. Rounding to 2 decimal places: 0.19\n\nTherefore, the Debt to Asset Ratio is 0.19.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.19'}}\n```",
