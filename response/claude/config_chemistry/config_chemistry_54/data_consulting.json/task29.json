                        "content": "I need to calculate several financial ratios based on the given financial statements. Let me analyze each one step by step.\n\n## 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nThe debt to equity ratio is calculated as: Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = $2,736,025.72 (Total Current Liabilities)\n- Total Shareholder's Equity = $11,330,150.23\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $2,736,025.72 / $11,330,150.23 = 0.2415\n\n## 2. Net Profit Margin\n\nThe net profit margin is calculated as: Net Profit / Total Revenue × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = -$1,669,849.77\n- Total Revenue = $6,920,513.79\n\nNet Profit Margin = (-$1,669,849.77 / $6,920,513.79) × 100% = -24.13%\n\n## 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n\nROA is calculated as: Net Profit / Total Assets × 100%\n\nFrom the financial statements:\n- Net Profit = -$1,669,849.77\n- Total Assets = $14,066,175.95\n\nROA = (-$1,669,849.77 / $14,066,175.95) × 100% = -11.87%\n\n## 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\nThis ratio is calculated as: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nSince we only have one period's accounts receivable data and the initial amount was zero, I'll use the end amount as the average:\n- Net Credit Sales = $6,920,513.79 (assuming all sales were on credit)\n- Accounts Receivable = $2,923,459.19\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $6,920,513.79 / $2,923,459.19 = 2.37\n\nNow, I'll present these calculations in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.24\", \"Net Profit Margin\": \"-24.13%\", \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"-11.87%\", \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.37\"}}\n```",
