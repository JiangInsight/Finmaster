                        "content": "I'll calculate the financial ratios step by step based on the given financial statements.\n\n## 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\n- Formula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n- Since we only have one period's data for Accounts Receivable, I'll use the ending balance.\n- Net Credit Sales = Main Business Revenue = $6,920,513.79\n- Accounts Receivable (ending) = $2,923,459.19\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $6,920,513.79 / $2,923,459.19 = 2.37\n\n## 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to cover current liabilities with its operating cash flow.\n- Formula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n- Operating Cash Flow = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$5,714,107.45\n- Current Liabilities = $2,736,025.72\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$5,714,107.45 / $2,736,025.72 = -2.09\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio calculated above.\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -2.09\n\n## 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n- Formula: Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n- Net Sales = $6,920,513.79\n- Average Total Assets = (Initial Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2\n- Average Total Assets = ($13,000,000.00 + $14,066,175.95) / 2 = $13,533,087.98\n\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = $6,920,513.79 / $13,533,087.98 = 0.51\n\n## 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio measures the proportion of a company's financing that comes from creditors versus shareholders.\n- Formula: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n- Total Liabilities = $2,736,025.72\n- Total Equity = $11,330,150.23\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $2,736,025.72 / $11,330,150.23 = 0.24\n\nNow I'll format the answer as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.37\", \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-2.09\", \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-2.09\", \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.51\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.24\"}}\n```",
