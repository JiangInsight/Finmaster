The recorded type is \"Administrative Expenses\" but the transaction ID starts with \"Sale\" and the invoice describes a sale transaction.\n2. The recorded date is \"2024-01-19\" but the invoice states \"On January 17, 2024...\"\n3. The recorded quantity is 2.0 but the invoice mentions 4.0 units.\n4. The recorded unit price is $24,046.46 but the invoice states $27,992.49.\n5. The recorded amount is $133,060.68 but according to the invoice, it should be $111,969.96 (4.0 units Ã— $27,992.49).\n\nThis transaction has multiple inconsistencies between the recorded data and what's stated in the invoice. Since the invoice is considered more reliable, I'll report these discrepancies.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Administrative Expenses', 'Original date': '2024-01-17', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-19', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '4.0', 'Recorded quantity': '2.0', 'Original price': '27992.49', 'Recorded price': '24046.46', 'Original receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Original amount': '111969.96', 'Recorded amount': '133060.68', 'Original tax': '5598.50', 'Recorded tax': '5598.5', 'Original profit': '31969.96', 'Recorded profit': '31969.96', 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240117035'} }\n```",
