The recorded date is \"2024-01-22\" but the invoice mentions \"On January 15, 2024\"\n2. The recorded amount is $22,902.43 but the invoice states $21,624.07\n\nThis appears to be an inconsistency between the recorded information and what's in the invoice description, which we're considering more reliable.\n\nLet me double-check this finding:\n- Invoice text clearly states \"January 15, 2024\" but record shows January 22\n- Invoice text states \"totaling $21624.07\" but recorded amount is $22902.43\n\nNo other significant inconsistencies were found in the dataset.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-15', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-22', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '21624.07', 'Recorded amount': '22902.43', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240115001'} }",
