Category discrepancy: Transaction ID starts with \"Purchase\" but is recorded as \"Sale\"\n2. Amount discrepancy: The invoice states $300,000.00 but the recorded amount is $323,485.16\n3. Unit price discrepancy: The invoice states $10,000.00 but the recorded price is $10,088.38\n\nThe invoice field (which is more reliable) states: \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Purchase, consisting of 30.0 units at a unit price of $10000.00, totaling $300000.00.\"\n\n## Now, let me check for any other inconsistencies:\n\nOne more transaction appears problematic:\n\nTransaction ID: Initial20231231001 appears three times with different types (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) but the same ID. While this is unusual, it might be an intentional grouping of initial assets rather than an error.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Purchase', 'Recorded category': 'Sale', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '10000.0', 'Recorded price': '10088.38', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '300000.0', 'Recorded amount': '323485.16', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Purchase20231231004'} }",
