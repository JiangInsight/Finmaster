The cost amount for this transaction was $50000.00, with a tax amount of $3000.20, leading to a total amount due of $57003.90. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\nDiscrepancies:\n1. Quantity: Invoice says 5.0, recorded data says 6.0\n2. Unit price: Invoice says $12000.82, recorded data says $10324.5\n3. Total amount: Invoice says $60004.10, recorded data says $72038.67\n4. Tax amount: Invoice says $3000.20, recorded data says $57672.77\n\nThe invoice appears to be consistent internally:\n- 5 units × $12000.82 = $60004.10 ✓\n- 5% tax on $60004.10 = $3000.20 ✓\n- $60004.10 - $3000.20 = $57003.90 (after tax amount) ✓\n- $60004.10 - $50000.00 = $10004.10 (profit) ✓\n\nSince the invoice is internally consistent and tax rates are standard regulated values, I'll trust the invoice information over the recorded data.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original quantity\": \"5.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"6.0\", \"Original price\": \"12000.82\", \"Recorded price\": \"10324.5\", \"Original amount\": \"60004.10\", \"Recorded amount\": \"72038.67\", \"Original tax\": \"3000.20\", \"Recorded tax\": \"57672.77\", \"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240109021\"}}\n```",
