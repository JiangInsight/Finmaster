The recorded date (Feb 10) doesn't match the invoice date (Jan 13)\n2. The recorded quantity (2.0) doesn't match the invoice quantity (3.0)\n3. The recorded unit price ($11,743.84) doesn't match the invoice unit price ($12,877.39)\n4. The recorded amount ($46,982.90) doesn't match either:\n   - It's not consistent with the recorded quantity and unit price (2.0 * $11,743.84 = $23,487.68)\n   - It's also not consistent with the invoice quantity and unit price (3.0 * $12,877.39 = $38,632.17)\n\nThis entry has multiple significant errors that don't align with basic mathematical expectations or with the invoice information.\n\nBased on the invoice being generally considered more reliable due to its standardized and regulated nature, the correct values should be those stated in the invoice:\n- Date: 2024-01-13\n- Quantity: 3.0\n- Unit price: $12,877.39\n- Amount: $38,632.17\n\nTherefore, my solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-13', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-10', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '3.0', 'Recorded quantity': '2.0', 'Original price': '12877.39', 'Recorded price': '11743.84', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '38632.17', 'Recorded amount': '46982.9', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240113027'} }\n```",
