For transaction `Sale20240117036`:\n   - The recorded quantity is 2, but the invoice says \"consisting of 4.0 units\"\n   - The recorded amount is $268,745.56, but if we multiply quantity (4) by unit price ($134,372.78), we get $537,491.12\n   - The total amount due in the invoice is $510,616.56, and recorded cost is $400,000 (which aligns with 4 units at $100,000 cost per unit)\n   - The invoice description mentions a profit of $137,491.12, which aligns with $537,491.12 - $400,000\n   \n   This shows a clear inconsistency where the quantity was incorrectly recorded as 2 instead of 4, and the amount was calculated incorrectly as a result.\n\nLet me check for other inconsistencies:\n\nFor `Purchase20231231001`:\n- The recorded payment status is \"Paid\" but payment method is \"Bank Transfer\"\n- The invoice confirms this transaction was paid via bank transfer\n- No inconsistency here\n\nFor most of the other transactions, I don't see obvious inconsistencies between the recorded data and the invoice descriptions. The values for unit prices, quantities, taxes, costs, profits, etc. generally align with what would be expected.\n\nBased on my analysis, I found one clear inconsistency:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '4.0', 'Recorded quantity': '2.0', 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '537491.12', 'Recorded amount': '268745.56', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': '137491.12', 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240117036'} }\n```",
