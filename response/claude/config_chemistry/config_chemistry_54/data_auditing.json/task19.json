Transaction ID: Interest20240129029\n   - The recorded category is \"Sales Expenses\" but the invoice clearly states it's for \"Interest Receivables\"\n   - The recorded date is \"2024-02-27\" but the invoice shows \"January 29, 2024\"\n\n2. Transaction ID: Expense20240122001 (Financial Expenses)\n   - The recorded type is \"Financial Expenses\" but the invoice states it's for \"Administrative Expenses\"\n   - The recorded date is \"2024-01-31\" but the invoice mentions \"January 22, 2024\"\n\nFor both transactions, the invoice description is more reliable, so the correct values should match what's stated in the invoice.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Interest Receivables', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original date': '2024-01-29', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-27', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Interest20240129029'} }\n```",
