The payment_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid. This transaction was prepared by Senior Staff, and the approver is Director.\"\n\nBut the data shows:\n- recorded_type: \"Purchase\" (should be \"Sales Expenses\")\n- recorded_amount: $52842.26 (should be $45924.34)\n\nThis is a clear inconsistency since the invoice (which is considered more reliable) states this is a Sales Expense with a different amount.\n\nThere's a second inconsistency in the data:\n\nFor transaction Expense20240128001, where the recorded_type is \"Sales Expenses\" but the invoice says \"Administrative Expenses\":\n\nAccording to the invoice: \"On January 28, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Administrative Expenses, totaling $22083.91.
