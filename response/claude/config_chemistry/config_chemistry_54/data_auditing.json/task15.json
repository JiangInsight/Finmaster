The recorded_type is \"Sales Expenses\" but the invoice describes a \"Sale\" transaction\n2. The recorded_amount is 0.0, but the invoice states the total is $26025.66\n3. The recorded_quantity is 0.0, but the invoice clearly mentions \"1.0 units\"\n\nComparing the invoice with the recorded data:\n- Invoice mentions: \"Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $26025.66, totaling $26025.66\"\n- Recorded data: \"Sales Expenses\" type with quantity 0.0 and amount 0.0\n\nThis is clearly incorrect. The transaction ID \"Sale20240108019\" also suggests this should be a Sale transaction.\n\n## Other transactions\nI've reviewed the other transactions and found no further internal inconsistencies where the recorded information contradicts the invoice details.\n\nTherefore, my solution identifies the Sale20240108019 transaction as containing errors:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"0.0\", \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"26025.66\", \"Recorded amount\": \"0.0\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240108019\"}}\n```",
