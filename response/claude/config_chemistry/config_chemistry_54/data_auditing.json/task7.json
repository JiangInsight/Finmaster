This is an inconsistency.\n\nAfter reviewing all transactions, I found one clear inconsistency in transaction `Interest20240121021` where the recorded receive_method does not match what's in the invoice. The invoice states it should be \"interest receviable\" but it's recorded as \"Cash\".\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Original receive_method\": \"Interest receviable\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Interest20240121021\"} }",
