The calculation for unit price × quantity matches the total amount in all cases where these fields are present.\n\nTherefore, the only inconsistency I found is with the \"Expense20240131001\" transaction, where the recorded amount (32703.08) doesn't match what's stated in the invoice text (30246.65).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '30246.65', 'Recorded amount': '32703.08', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240131001'} }\n```",
