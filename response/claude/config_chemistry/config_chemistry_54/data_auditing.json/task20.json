Transaction with ID \"Purchase20231231011\" has a recorded_type of \"Depreciation\" but the invoice clearly states it's a \"Purchase\": \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Purchase, consisting of 15.0 units at a unit price of $20000.00, totaling $300000.00.\" This is inconsistent.\n\nNext, I'll check for price inconsistencies:\n\n2. Same transaction \"Purchase20231231011\" shows a recorded_unit_price of $22762.96, but the invoice states the unit price as $20000.00.\n\nLet me check for other inconsistencies:\n\nLooking through the remaining transactions, I don't see any other clear inconsistencies between the recorded fields and what the invoice states. The unit quantities, amounts, payment methods, and statuses seem to match what's described in the invoices.\n\nTherefore, I'll report the inconsistencies found in transaction \"Purchase20231231011\":\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Purchase\", \"Recorded category\": \"Depreciation\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"20000.0\", \"Recorded price\": \"22762.96\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Purchase20231231011\"}}\n```",
