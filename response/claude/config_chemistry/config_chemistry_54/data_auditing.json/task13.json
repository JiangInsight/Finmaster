The recorded type is \"Administrative Expenses\" but the transaction description in the invoice clearly indicates it's a Sale transaction:\n   * The ID starts with \"Sale\"\n   * The invoice describes a sale consisting of 5.0 units at a unit price of $26968.38\n\n2. The recorded tax amount is significantly off:\n   * Recorded tax: $118,464.73\n   * Based on the invoice, the calculated tax should be $6,742.10 (which is the amount mentioned in the invoice)\n   * This is a clear numerical error in the tax amount\n\n3. The rest of the transaction details (cost amount, product, quantity, etc.) all align with this being a sale transaction rather than an administrative expense.\n\nTherefore, the transaction \"Sale20240129058\" has two inconsistencies:\n1. The transaction type is incorrectly recorded as \"Administrative Expenses\" instead of \"Sale\"\n2. The tax amount is incorrectly recorded as $118,464.73 instead of $6,742.10\n\nLet me provide the solution in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": \"6742.10\", \"Recorded tax\": \"118464.73\", \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240129058\"}}\n```",
