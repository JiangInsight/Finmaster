                        "content": "I need to calculate the final net increase in cash and cash equivalents from the cash flow statement. Let me analyze the transactions systematically.\n\nFirst, I'll categorize the transactions affecting cash and cash equivalents:\n\n1. Initial balances:\n   - Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n   - Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n\n2. Cash inflows:\n   - Sales with cash payment method\n   - Bank to cash transfers\n   - Interest received in cash\n\n3. Cash outflows:\n   - Purchases with cash or bank transfer payment methods\n   - Expenses paid in cash\n   - Fixed asset purchases paid in cash or bank transfer\n   - Cash to bank transfers\n\nLet me calculate the net effect on cash and cash equivalents (cash + bank balances).\n\nStarting with the initial balances:\n- Initial Cash: 3,000,000.00\n- Initial Bank: 5,000,000.00\n- Total initial cash equivalents: 8,000,000.00\n\nNow I'll track cash inflows and outflows:\n\n**Cash Inflows from Sales (paid in cash or received cash):**\nI need to sum all the sales with \"Paid\" status and \"Cash\" receive method.\nTotal from sales paid in cash: \n11,498.27 + 93,580.28 + 96,770.88 + 67,806.75 + 116,898.14 + 659,298.95 + 267,311.66 + 35,930.91 + 67,132.14 + 134,717.66 + 644,182.50 + 25,216.28 + 620,407.25 + 59,166.45 + 231,037.80 + 75,890.52 + 117,441.68 + 552,114.20 + 411,855.06 + 265,712.00 + 47,800.68 + 82,693.50 + 128,615.27 + 135,563.82 + 575,061.65 + 206,035.50 + 50,289.32 + 57,306.10 = 5,631,336.12\n\n**Cash Outflows from Purchases (paid in cash or bank transfer):**\n280,000.00 (Bank Transfer) + 500,000.00 (Bank Transfer) + 300,000.00 (Cash) + 2,900,000.00 (Cash) + 1,050,000.00 (Cash) + 220,000.00 (Cash) + 100,000.00 (Bank Transfer) + 1,800,000.00 (Cash) + 320,000.00 (Bank Transfer) + 260,000.00 (Cash) = 7,730,000.00\n\n**Cash Outflows from Fixed Asset Purchases:**\n324,677.57 (Bank Transfer)\n\n**Cash Outflows from Expenses (all paid in cash):**\nTotal expenses paid: 2,484,336.98 (summing all expense transactions with \"Paid\" status)\n\n**Bank to Cash and Cash to Bank Transfers:**\nThese transfers move money between cash and bank accounts but don't change the total cash equivalent balance.\n\n**Interest Receivables:**\nThese are recognized but not received in cash (all \"Unpaid\"), so they don't affect cash flow.\n\n**Depreciation:**\n45,753.36 - This is a non-cash expense, so it doesn't affect cash flow.\n\nLet me calculate the final net increase in cash and cash equivalents:\n\nInitial balance: 8,000,000.00\n+ Cash inflows from sales: 5,631,336.12\n- Cash outflows from purchases: 7,730,000.00\n- Cash outflows from fixed asset purchases: 324,677.57\n- Cash outflows from expenses: 2,484,336.98\n\nNet change = 5,631,336.12 - 7,730,000.00 - 324,677.57 - 2,484,336.98 = -4,907,678.43\n\nTherefore, the final net increase (which is actually a decrease) in cash and cash equivalents is -4,907,678.43.\n\nHowever, I need to double-check this. Let me verify by looking at transactions marked as \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Payable/Receivable\" since these don't affect cash flow immediately.\n\nI notice there are two purchases that are unpaid:\n- Purchase20231231009: 800,000.00 (Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231012: 1,300,000.00 (Account Payable)\n\nThese should not be included in our cash outflow calculation since they don't affect cash immediately.\n\nAdjusted purchases outflow: 7,730,000.00 - 800,000.00 - 1,300,000.00 = 5,630,000.00\n\nRecalculating the net change:\n5,631,336.12 - 5,630,000.00 - 324,677.57 - 2,484,336.98 = -2,807,678.43\n\nTherefore, the final net increase in cash and cash equivalents is -2,807,678.43.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Net Increase': '-2807678.43'}}",
