From the data provided, I can see the initial deposits from the transactions marked as \"Initial20231231001\".\n\nLooking at these initial transactions:\n\n1. `Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 3000000.0 | 3000000.0`\n2. `Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0`\n\nThese represent the initial cash and bank balances as of December 31, 2023. Cash equivalents generally include bank deposits and other highly liquid investments, so I need to add both:\n\nCash deposit: 3,000,000.00\nBank deposit: 5,000,000.00\nTotal beginning cash and cash equivalents: 8,000,000.00\n\nSince this is the total of all cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period (December 31, 2023), this is the beginning balance for the cash flow statement.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
