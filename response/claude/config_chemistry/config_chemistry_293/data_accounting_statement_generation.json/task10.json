The initial value is clear, but I want to verify if there are any other transactions affecting non-current assets that I might have missed.\n\nLooking at the data again, I don't see any disposals or other transactions affecting the non-current assets. Therefore, the calculation above should be correct. \n\nActually, let me format the numbers properly to two decimal places:\n- Initial value = 5,000,000.00\n- New fixed asset purchases = 324,677.57\n- Depreciation = 45,753.36\n- Final value = 5,279,924.21\n\nLet me verify this final calculation:\n5,000,000.00 + 324,677.57 - 45,753.36 = 5,278,924.21\n\nSo the final value of non-current assets is 5,278,924.21.\n\nWait, I need to double-check my calculations:\n5,000,000.00 + 324,677.57 = 5,324,677.57\n5,324,677.57 - 45,753.36 = 5,278,924.21\n\nYes, the final value is 5,278,924.21, but I'll round it to two decimal places: 5,278,924.21\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '5278924.21'} }\n```",
