A positive number represents a decrease in inventory (cash inflow), while a negative number represents an increase in inventory (cash outflow).\n\n## Step 2: Identify inventory-related transactions\nIn this dataset, inventory transactions are represented by \"Purchase\" transactions (inventory increases) and \"Sale\" transactions (inventory decreases).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate total purchases\nLet's identify all the \"Purchase\" transactions and sum them up:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 280,000.00\n- Purchase20231231002: 500,000.00\n- Purchase20231231003: 300,000.00\n- Purchase20231231004: 2,900,000.00\n- Purchase20231231005: 1,050,000.00\n- Purchase20231231006: 220,000.00\n- Purchase20231231007: 100,000.00\n- Purchase20231231008: 1,800,000.00\n- Purchase20231231009: 800,000.00\n- Purchase20231231010: 320,000.00\n- Purchase20231231011: 260,000.00\n- Purchase20231231012: 1,300,000.00\n\nTotal Purchases: 9,830,000.00\n\n## Step 4: Calculate cost of goods sold\nFor the cost of goods sold, I need to look at the \"cost_amount\" in all the \"Sale\" transactions:\n\nLet me sum up all the cost_amount values from the sale transactions:\n\nTotal Cost of Goods Sold: 4,740,000.00\n\nThis represents:\n- 500,000 (P001 Chemical Product A sales)\n- 700,000 (P002 Chemical Product B sales)\n- 1,350,000 (P003 Chemical Product C sales)\n- 2,100,000 (P004 Chemical Product D sales)\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the inventory change\nInventory Change = Purchases - Cost of Goods Sold\nInventory Change = 9,830,000.00 - 4,740,000.00 = 5,090,000.00\n\nSince this represents an increase in inventory, we need to show it as a negative number in the cash flow statement:\n\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory = -5,090,000.00\n\nTherefore, the (Increase) Decrease in Inventory figure in the cash flow statement would be -5,090,000.00.\n\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-5090000.00'}}",
