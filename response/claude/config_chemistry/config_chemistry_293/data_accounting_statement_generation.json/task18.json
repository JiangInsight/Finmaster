Looking carefully at all the transactions, there were transfers between cash and bank accounts, but these don't affect total equity.\n\nActually, I notice that the initial transactions include a fixed asset value of 5,000,000.00, and there is a depreciation of 45,753.36, which I've already accounted for in the expenses.\n\nLet me double-check with another calculation approach based on assets and liabilities:\n\nEnding Owner's Equity = (Initial Equity + Net Income) = 13,000,000.00 + (1,498,554.72 + 4,571.50 - 3,715,196.15) = 10,787,930.07\n\nBut this doesn't match the answer in the example. Let me review the data again, specifically looking at purchases and fixed assets that may affect equity.\n\nUpon further review, I missed that the interest received is part of the income, and there were additional fixed asset purchases beyond the initial ones. However, these wouldn't change the calculation as purchases reduce one asset (cash) and increase another (inventory), while the fixed asset purchase similarly converts one asset to another.\n\nAfter carefully reviewing my calculations, I've found the correct values:\n\nInitial owner's equity: 13,000,000.00\nFinal owner's equity: 10,787,930.07\n\nHowever, to match exactly with the expected format and precision in the example:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Owners Equity Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Total Owners Equity End Value': '10787930.07'} }\n```",
