Let me approach this step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Identify Initial Inventory\nLooking at the data, I notice that on 2023-12-31, there are multiple purchase transactions but no initial inventory value explicitly stated. This means the initial inventory is 0, and we need to add all purchases to calculate the ending inventory.\n\n## Step 2: Identify all Purchase Transactions\nThese are all transactions with type \"Purchase\" and date \"2023-12-31\":\n\n1. Purchase20231231001: 280,000.00 (28 units of Chemical Product A at 10,000 per unit)\n2. Purchase20231231002: 500,000.00 (25 units of Chemical Product B at 20,000 per unit)\n3. Purchase20231231003: 300,000.00 (6 units of Chemical Product C at 50,000 per unit)\n4. Purchase20231231004: 2,900,000.00 (29 units of Chemical Product D at 100,000 per unit)\n5. Purchase20231231005: 1,050,000.00 (21 units of Chemical Product C at 50,000 per unit)\n6. Purchase20231231006: 220,000.00 (11 units of Chemical Product B at 20,000 per unit)\n7. Purchase20231231007: 100,000.00 (10 units of Chemical Product A at 10,000 per unit)\n8. Purchase20231231008: 1,800,000.00 (18 units of Chemical Product D at 100,000 per unit)\n9. Purchase20231231009: 800,000.00 (16 units of Chemical Product C at 50,000 per unit)\n10. Purchase20231231010: 320,000.00 (16 units of Chemical Product B at 20,000 per unit)\n11. Purchase20231231011: 260,000.00 (26 units of Chemical Product A at 10,000 per unit)\n12. Purchase20231231012: 1,300,000.00 (13 units of Chemical Product D at 100,000 per unit)\n\nTotal purchases = 9,830,000.00\n\n## Step 3: Identify all Sales Transactions\nNow I need to identify all sales transactions to calculate cost of goods sold, which I'll subtract from the purchases.\n\nI'll count the number of units sold for each product:\n\n- Chemical Product A: \n  - Sale20240102002: 1 unit\n  - Sale20240102003: 3 units\n  - Sale20240105007: Not Product A\n  - Sale20240110015: 3 units\n  - Sale20240113024: 2 units\n  - Sale20240116031: 5 units\n  - Sale20240123052: 4 units\n  - Sale20240126059: 3 units\n  - Sale20240127063: 5 units\n  - Sale20240128065: 5 units\n  - Sale20240130069: 5 units\n  \n  Total Product A sold: 36 units (cost: 36 × 10,000 = 360,000)\n\n- Chemical Product B:\n  - Sale20240103004: 4 units\n  - Sale20240106009: 3 units\n  - Sale20240113023: 2 units\n  - Sale20240117034: 3 units\n  - Sale20240118039: 4 units\n  - Sale20240120043: 2 units\n  - Sale20240121048: 2 units\n  - Sale20240124053: 3 units\n  - Sale20240130068: 2 units\n  \n  Total Product B sold: 25 units (cost: 25 × 20,000 = 500,000)\n\n- Chemical Product C:\n  - Sale20240106010: 2 units\n  - Sale20240111017: 1 unit\n  - Sale20240111018: 2 units\n  - Sale20240117035: 4 units\n  - Sale20240119041: 2 units\n  - Sale20240122051: 4 units\n  - Sale20240125055: 2 units\n  - Sale20240126060: 2 units\n  - Sale20240129067: 3 units\n  \n  Total Product C sold: 22 units (cost: 22 × 50,000 = 1,100,000)\n\n- Chemical Product D:\n  - Sale20240107011: 5 units\n  - Sale20240108013: 2 units\n  - Sale20240110016: 4 units\n  - Sale20240112020: 5 units\n  - Sale20240114027: 5 units\n  - Sale20240121047: 5 units\n  - Sale20240122050: 3 units\n  - Sale20240124054: 1 unit\n  - Sale20240125056: 4 units\n  - Sale20240127062: 5 units\n  \n  Total Product D sold: 39 units (cost: 39 × 100,000 = 3,900,000)\n\nTotal cost of goods sold = 360,000 + 500,000 + 1,100,000 + 3,900,000 = 5,860,000\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Ending Inventory\nEnding Inventory = Total Purchases - Cost of Goods Sold\nEnding Inventory = 9,830,000 - 5,860,000 = 3,970,000\n\n## Step 5: Double-check Calculations\nLet me verify my unit counting:\n\nProduct A: \nPurchased = 28 + 10 + 26 = 64 units\nSold = 36 units\nRemaining = 28 units (Cost: 280,000)\n\nProduct B:\nPurchased = 25 + 11 + 16 = 52 units\nSold = 25 units\nRemaining = 27 units (Cost: 540,000)\n\nProduct C:\nPurchased = 6 + 21 + 16 = 43 units\nSold = 22 units\nRemaining = 21 units (Cost: 1,050,000)\n\nProduct D:\nPurchased = 29 + 18 + 13 = 60 units\nSold = 39 units\nRemaining = 21 units (Cost: 2,100,000)\n\nRecomputed ending inventory = 280,000 + 540,000 + 1,050,000 + 2,100,000 = 3,970,000\n\nWait, I need to double-check my numbers again as there's a discrepancy.\n\nLet me recalculate more carefully:\n- Product A: Total purchased = 64 units, Sold = 36 units, Remaining = 28 units (Cost: 280,000)\n- Product B: Total purchased = 52 units, Sold = 25 units, Remaining = 27 units (Cost: 540,000)\n- Product C: Total purchased = 43 units, Sold = 22 units, Remaining = 21 units (Cost: 1,050,000)\n- Product D: Total purchased = 60 units, Sold = 39 units, Remaining = 21 units (Cost: 2,100,000)\n\nTotal ending inventory value = 280,000 + 540,000 + 1,050,000 + 2,100,000 = 3,970,000\n\nAfter reviewing all the transactions again, I noticed I made an error. Let me recalculate the value based on the correct units and costs:\n\nFinal calculation for ending inventory:\n- Product A: 28 units at 10,000 = 280,000\n- Product B: 27 units at 20,000 = 540,000\n- Product C: 21 units at 50,000 = 1,050,000\n- Product D: 21 units at 100,000 = 2,100,000\n\nTotal ending inventory = 3,970,000\n\nIn summary:\n- Initial inventory value: 0.00 (no inventory at the beginning)\n- Ending inventory value: 3,970,000.00\n\nBased on my analysis, I believe there's an additional calculation factor I need to consider. Let me look at the example solution again... \n\nThe example shows an ending inventory of 5,090,000.00. This could mean I missed some inventory or calculated incorrectly. Let me review my calculation one more time:\n\nFor simple verification, let me add up all purchases and subtract all sales at cost:\nTotal purchases: 9,830,000.00\nTotal cost of goods sold: 5,860,000.00\nEnding inventory: 3,970,000.00\n\nThe discrepancy might be due to how I'm counting the purchases and sales. Let me adjust my approach.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Initial Value': '0.00', 'Inventory End Value': '3970000.00'} }\n```",
