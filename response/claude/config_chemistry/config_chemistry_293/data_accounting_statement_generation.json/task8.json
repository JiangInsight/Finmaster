It's a contra-asset account that reduces the value of fixed assets on the balance sheet.\n\n## Step 2: Check for initial accumulated depreciation\nLooking at the initial transactions dated 2023-12-31, I don't see any specific entry for accumulated depreciation. Since this appears to be the beginning of records, we can assume the initial accumulated depreciation value is 0.00.\n\n## Step 3: Identify depreciation transactions\nThe key transaction to look for is any entry with type \"Depreciation\". Looking through the data, I can see:\n\n```\n| Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45753.36 | 45753.36 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n```\n\nThis is the only depreciation entry in the data, with an amount of 45,753.36.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final accumulated depreciation\nSince there was no initial accumulated depreciation (starting at 0) and only one depreciation expense recorded during the period for 45,753.36, the final accumulated depreciation would be 45,753.36.\n\n## Step 5: Format the answer\nThe accumulated depreciation initial value is 0.00 and the end value is 45,753.36.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accumulated Depreciation End Value': '45753.36'} }\n```",
