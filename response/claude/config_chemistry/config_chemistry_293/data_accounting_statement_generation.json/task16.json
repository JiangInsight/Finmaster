These are typically found in the beginning balance and are marked as deposits.\n\nIn the data, I can see the initial contributions on 2023-12-31:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.0\n\nThese three transactions with the ID \"Initial20231231001\" represent the initial paid-in capital.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total initial paid-in capital\nAdding these initial contributions:\n3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 = 13,000,000.0\n\n## Step 3: Check for additional capital contributions or withdrawals\nI need to examine if there were any additional capital contributions or withdrawals during the period. This would typically appear as:\n- Additional capital injections from owners/shareholders\n- Return of capital to owners\n- Stock issuances or buybacks\n\nLooking through all the transactions, I don't see any entries that clearly indicate additional capital contributions or withdrawals. The transactions are primarily related to:\n- Purchases and sales\n- Expenses\n- Transfers between cash and bank\n- Interest receivables\n- Depreciation\n- Fixed asset purchases\n\n## Step 4: Determine the final paid-in capital amount\nSince there were no additional capital contributions or withdrawals identified, the final paid-in capital remains the same as the initial amount: 13,000,000.0\n\n## Step 5: Format the answer\nThe paid-in capital is 13,000,000.00 for both the initial and final amounts.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
