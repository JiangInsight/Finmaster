These would typically be transactions with the type \"Interest Receivables\".\n\nLet me go through the data and collect all transactions related to interest:\n\nJanuary 1, 2024: Interest Receivables - 420.08\nJanuary 2, 2024: Interest Receivables - 375.58\nJanuary 3, 2024: Interest Receivables - 346.68369627\nJanuary 4, 2024: Interest Receivables - 291.07612692\nJanuary 5, 2024: Interest Receivables - 235.21708718\nJanuary 6, 2024: Interest Receivables - 199.61708718\nJanuary 7, 2024: Interest Receivables - 199.61708718\nJanuary 8, 2024: Interest Receivables - 199.61708718\nJanuary 9, 2024: Interest Receivables - 199.61708718\nJanuary 10, 2024: Interest Receivables - 199.61708718\nJanuary 11, 2024: Interest Receivables - 199.61708718\nJanuary 12, 2024: Interest Receivables - 199.61708718\nJanuary 13, 2024: Interest Receivables - 190.71708718\nJanuary 14, 2024: Interest Receivables - 190.71708718\nJanuary 15, 2024: Interest Receivables - 164.01708718\nJanuary 16, 2024: Interest Receivables - 164.01708718\nJanuary 17, 2024: Interest Receivables - 164.01708718\nJanuary 18, 2024: Interest Receivables - 164.01708718\nJanuary 19, 2024: Interest Receivables - 164.01708718\nJanuary 20, 2024: Interest Receivables - 135.53708718000001\nJanuary 21, 2024: Interest Receivables - 135.53708718000001\nJanuary 22, 2024: Interest Receivables - 135.53708718000001\nJanuary 23, 2024: Interest Receivables - 135.53708718000001\nJanuary 24, 2024: Interest Receivables - 135.53708718000001\nJanuary 25, 2024: Interest Receivables - 135.53708718000001\nJanuary 26, 2024: Interest Receivables - 135.53708718000001\nJanuary 27, 2024: Interest Receivables - 135.53708718000001\nJanuary 28, 2024: Interest Receivables - 135.53708718000001\nJanuary 29, 2024: Interest Receivables - 135.53708718000001\nJanuary 30, 2024: Interest Receivables - 135.53708718000001\n\nNow, I'll sum up all these interest amounts to get the total interest income:\n\n420.08 + 375.58 + 346.68369627 + 291.07612692 + 235.21708718 + 199.61708718 + 199.61708718 + 199.61708718 + 199.61708718 + 199.61708718 + 199.61708718 + 199.61708718 + 190.71708718 + 190.71708718 + 164.01708718 + 164.01708718 + 164.01708718 + 164.01708718 + 164.01708718 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 = 5,586.08\n\nCalculating the sum:\nSum = 5,586.08\n\nTherefore, the final interest income item in the income statement is $5,586.08.\n\nWait, I need to verify this calculation to ensure accuracy. Let me recalculate using a more systematic approach:\n\nJanuary 1 to January 10 (10 days):\n420.08 + 375.58 + 346.68369627 + 291.07612692 + 235.21708718 + 199.61708718 + 199.61708718 + 199.61708718 + 199.61708718 + 199.61708718 = 2,666.64\n\nJanuary 11 to January 20 (10 days):\n199.61708718 + 199.61708718 + 190.71708718 + 190.71708718 + 164.01708718 + 164.01708718 + 164.01708718 + 164.01708718 + 164.01708718 + 135.53708718000001 = 1,736.27\n\nJanuary 21 to January 30 (10 days):\n135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 = 1,355.37\n\nTotal: 2,666.64 + 1,736.27 + 1,355.37 = 5,758.28\n\nI notice a discrepancy in my calculations. Let me double-check by summing these values individually:\n\nTotal = 420.08 + 375.58 + 346.68369627 + 291.07612692 + 235.21708718 + 199.61708718 + 199.61708718 + 199.61708718 + 199.61708718 + 199.61708718 + 199.61708718 + 199.61708718 + 190.71708718 + 190.71708718 + 164.01708718 + 164.01708718 + 164.01708718 + 164.01708718 + 164.01708718 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001 + 135.53708718000001\n\nThis gives me a total of approximately 5,757.29.\n\nLet me round this to two decimal places: $5,757.29\n\nTherefore, the interest income is $5,757.29.\n\nActually, let me make one final check by manually reviewing the data:\n\nI need to sum all the \"Interest Receivables\" entries in the \"amount\" column. The total comes to $5,757.29.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Interest Income': '5757.29'} }\n```",
