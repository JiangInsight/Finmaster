Let me analyze the data systematically.\n\n## Step 1: Identify depreciation transactions\nIn the cash flow statement, depreciation is a non-cash expense that needs to be added back to calculate the cash flow from operations. Looking at the transactions, I need to find entries with the type \"Depreciation\".\n\nFrom the data, I can see there's one depreciation entry:\n- ID: Depreciation20240101001\n- Type: Depreciation\n- Date: 2024-01-01\n- Amount: 45753.36\n\n## Step 2: Verify this is the only depreciation entry\nI've checked the entire dataset, and I only found one transaction labeled as \"Depreciation\", which is the one on January 1, 2024, with the amount of 45753.36.\n\n## Step 3: Confirm this is the final value\nSince there is only one depreciation entry in the dataset for the period covered, this amount represents the total depreciation that would appear in the cash flow statement.\n\nThe final depreciation amount to be included in the cash flow statement is 45753.36.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45753.36'} }\n```",
