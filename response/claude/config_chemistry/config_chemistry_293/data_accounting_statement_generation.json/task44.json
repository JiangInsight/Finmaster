These would typically be categorized as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar.\n\nStep 1: Search for transactions with type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\"\n\nIn the data, I can see one transaction with this type:\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 324677.57 | 324677.57 |  |  | Paid | Bank Transfer |  | S005 | Supplier 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Processing Equipment4 | Processing Equipment |\n\nStep 2: Verify if there are any other fixed asset-related transactions\n\nLooking at the initial balance, there is a \"Fixed Assets\" entry:\n- Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\nHowever, this appears to be an initial balance rather than a purchase during the reporting period.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total fixed asset purchases\n\nThe total purchase of fixed assets is the sum of all fixed asset purchase transactions during the period:\n- FixedAsset20231231001: 324677.57\n\nTherefore, the final purchase of fixed assets in the cash flow statement is 324677.57.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '324677.57'} }\n```",
