These are typically found with the type \"Depreciation\" in the data.\n\nReviewing the transactions, I can see one specific depreciation entry:\n\n| id | type | date | recorded_date | amount | recorded_amount |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45753.36 | 45753.36 |\n\nThe depreciation amount recorded for the period is 45753.36. This represents the amount by which the fixed assets have been depreciated during the accounting period.\n\nThe task asks for the final depreciation item in the income statement, and this is the only depreciation entry I can find in the data.\n\nTherefore, the solution is the amount of this depreciation entry:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45753.36'}}\n```",
