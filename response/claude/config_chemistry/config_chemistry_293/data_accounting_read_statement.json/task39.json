The negative value indicates an increase in inventory during the period (cash outflow), but for the purpose of this task, I need to identify the amount of reduction in inventory.\n\nSince the question asks for \"reduction in the amount of assets held for sale\", I should note that the value is negative because it represents an increase rather than a reduction. However, the absolute value represents the change in inventory during the period.\n\nTherefore, the value for the reduction in assets held for sale (inventory) is -3540000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-3540000.00'}}\n```",
