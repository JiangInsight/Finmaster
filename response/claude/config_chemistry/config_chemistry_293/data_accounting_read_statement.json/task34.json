Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period\n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole\n\nLet me analyze the income statement:\n\n1. For total income from ordinary activities, I should look for the total revenue line\n   - \"Total Revenue\" shows 7825951.24\n\n2. For carrying amount of inventories sold, I should look for the cost of goods sold\n   - \"Cost of Goods Sold\" shows 6290000.00\n\n3. For costs of general management and administration, I should look for administrative expenses\n   - \"Administrative Expenses\" shows 1335153.59\n\nTherefore, the three values I need to extract are:\n- value1 (total income): 7825951.24\n- value2 (carrying amount of inventories sold): 6290000.00\n- value3 (costs of general management and administration): 1335153.59\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '7825951.24', 'value2': '6290000.00', 'value3': '1335153.59'}}\n```",
