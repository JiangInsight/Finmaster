The net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nLet me examine the financial statements carefully.\n\nFor the first item, I need to find interest accrued but not yet received. Looking at the balance sheet, I can see \"Interest Receivable\" with an end amount of 5758.38. This represents interest that has been earned but not yet received.\n\nFor the second item, I need to find the net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period. In the cash flow statement, I see \"Net Increase\" of -4723437.95. This negative value indicates a decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\nTherefore:\n- value1 (interest accrued but not yet received): 5758.38\n- value2 (net addition in cash and cash equivalents): -4723437.95\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5758.38', 'value2': '-4723437.95'}}\n```",
