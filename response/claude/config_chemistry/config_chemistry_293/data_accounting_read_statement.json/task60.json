The income earned by the entity from financial assets\n\nLet me analyze each financial statement to find these items:\n\n## Balance Sheet\nLooking at the balance sheet, I can see \"Bank Deposits\" with an end amount of 1,522,888.62 as of 2024-01-30. This represents the funds deposited into a bank.\n\n## Income Statement\nLooking at the income statement, I can see \"Interest Income\" with an amount of 5,758.38 as of 2024-01-30. This represents income earned from financial assets.\n\n## Cash Flow Statement\nThe cash flow statement confirms these values by showing \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" of -5,758.38, which corresponds to the interest income earned.\n\nTherefore, the two values I need to extract are:\n1. Bank Deposits (end value): 1,522,888.62\n2. Interest Income: 5,758.38\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1522888.62', 'value2': '5758.38'}}\n```",
