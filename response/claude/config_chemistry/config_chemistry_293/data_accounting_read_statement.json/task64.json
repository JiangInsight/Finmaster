Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares\n\nLet me analyze each statement:\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- \"Paid-in Capital\" represents capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares: 13000000.00\n- \"Accounts Payable\" shows the amount owed for goods or services received on credit: 2100000.00\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- \"Profit Before Tax\" shows profit/loss before deducting tax expense: -1010139.34\n\nThe three values I need to extract are:\n1. Paid-in Capital: 13000000.00\n2. Profit Before Tax: -1010139.34\n3. Accounts Payable: 2100000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '-1010139.34', 'value3': '2100000.00'}}\n```",
