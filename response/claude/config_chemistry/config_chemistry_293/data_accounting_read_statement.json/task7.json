Based on the balance sheet provided, I need to find the expense item.\n\nIn a balance sheet, depreciation expense is typically reflected in the \"Accumulated Depreciation\" account. This is a contra-asset account that accumulates the total depreciation expenses over time.\n\nFrom the given data:\n- Accumulated Depreciation had an initial value of 0.00 on 2023-12-31\n- Accumulated Depreciation had an end value of 45753.36 on 2024-01-30\n\nThe change in accumulated depreciation represents the depreciation expense for the period. Since the initial value was 0.00 and the end value is 45753.36, this indicates that 45753.36 was recognized as depreciation expense during the period.\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '45753.36'}}\n```",
