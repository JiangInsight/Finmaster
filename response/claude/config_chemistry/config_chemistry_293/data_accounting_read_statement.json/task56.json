In the balance sheet as \"Accumulated Depreciation\" with an end amount of 45753.36\n2. In the cash flow statement as \"Depreciation\" with an amount of 45753.36\n3. In the income statement as \"Depreciation\" with an amount of 45753.36\n\nThe depreciation expense for the period is consistently shown as 45753.36 across all statements. This represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of assets over their useful lives during this financial period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45753.36'} }\n```",
