Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit - this would be \"Accounts Receivable\" on the Balance Sheet\n2. Financing costs incurred for raising funds for operations - this would be \"Financial Expenses\" on the Income Statement\n3. Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment - this would be \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" on the Cash Flow Statement\n\nLet me extract these three values from the financial statements:\n\n1. From the Balance Sheet:\n   - Accounts Receivable: End_amount = 1988616.02\n\n2. From the Income Statement:\n   - Financial Expenses: Amount = 543212.45\n\n3. From the Cash Flow Statement:\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: Amount = 324677.57\n\nThese are the three specific line items and their end values that match the criteria requested.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1988616.02', 'value2': '543212.45', 'value3': '324677.57'}}\n```",
