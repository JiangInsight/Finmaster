This represents the entity's profit (in this case, a loss) after all expenses have been accounted for.\n\nThe Net Profit line item is typically the starting point of the cash flow statement's operating section, and it represents the bottom-line profit or loss after considering all revenue, operating costs, interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.\n\nTherefore, the amount of profit (in this case, loss) that the entity retains after all expenses is -1,401,436.89.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1401436.89'}}\n```",
