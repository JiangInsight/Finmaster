Assets are divided into two main categories:\n   - Current Assets: Assets expected to be realized or consumed within the operating cycle\n   - Non-current Assets: Assets not expected to be realized or consumed within the operating cycle\n\n2. The non-current assets in the balance sheet are represented by \"Total Non-current Assets\" line item:\n   - Initial value (2023-12-31): 5000000.00\n   - End value (2024-01-30): 5278924.21\n\n3. This total includes Fixed Assets (minus Accumulated Depreciation) and any other long-term assets that are not intended for sale or consumption in the normal operating cycle.\n\nSince the task asks for assets not expected to be realized in the normal operating cycle, the \"Total Non-current Assets\" value is the correct answer.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5278924.21'}}\n```",
