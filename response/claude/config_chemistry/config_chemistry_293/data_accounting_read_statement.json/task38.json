Accounts receivable represents money that customers owe the company for goods or services provided on credit.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement provided:\n- \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is listed as \"-1988616.02\"\n\nThe negative sign indicates an increase in accounts receivable (meaning more money is owed to the company), not a decrease. However, the task asks for the value of the decrease, which is this same number but representing the impact on cash flow.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-1988616.02\"}}\n```",
