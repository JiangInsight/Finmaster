So the total cash available would be:\n- Initial total: 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 8,000,000.00\n- End total: 1,753,673.43 + 1,522,888.62 = 3,276,562.05\n\nHowever, based on the example provided, it appears that only \"Cash on Hand\" is being considered as the cash available for day-to-day operations, not the sum of Cash on Hand and Bank Deposits.\n\nFollowing this pattern from the example:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '3000000.00', 'end value': '1753673.43'}}\n```",
