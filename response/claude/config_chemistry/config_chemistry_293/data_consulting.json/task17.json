Operating Cash Flow: From the cash flow statement, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,398,760.38\n\n2. Total Debt: From the balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\n   (There doesn't appear to be any long-term debt, so the total debt is equal to the current liabilities)\n\nNow I can calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -4,398,760.38 / 2,491,297.55\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -1.77\n\nRounding to two decimal places: -1.77\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.77'} }\n```",
