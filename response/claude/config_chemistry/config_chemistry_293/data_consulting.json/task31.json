                        "content": "I need to calculate several financial ratios based on the financial statements provided. Let me work through each ratio step by step.\n\n## 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company is collecting revenue from customers.\nFormula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n- Net Credit Sales = Main Business Revenue = $7,825,951.24\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning A/R + Ending A/R) / 2 = ($0 + $1,988,616.02) / 2 = $994,308.01\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = $7,825,951.24 / $994,308.01 = 7.87\n\n## 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio (same as Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio)\nThis ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow generated from operations.\nFormula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$4,398,760.38\n- Total Current Liabilities = $2,491,297.55\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$4,398,760.38 / $2,491,297.55 = -1.77\n\n## 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company is using its assets to generate revenue.\nFormula: Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\n- Net Sales = $7,825,951.24\n- Average Total Assets = (Beginning Assets + Ending Assets) / 2 = ($13,000,000 + $14,089,860.66) / 2 = $13,544,930.33\n\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = $7,825,951.24 / $13,544,930.33 = 0.58\n\n## 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio indicates the proportion of equity and debt used to finance a company's assets.\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities = $2,491,297.55\n- Total Shareholders' Equity = $11,598,563.11\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $2,491,297.55 / $11,598,563.11 = 0.21\n\nNow I'll round these values to 2 decimal places for the final solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"7.87\", \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-1.77\", \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.77\", \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.58\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.21\"}}\n```",
