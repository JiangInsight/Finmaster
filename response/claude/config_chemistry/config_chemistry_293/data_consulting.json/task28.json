Debt to Asset Ratio\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio shows what portion of a company's assets is financed by debt.\n- Formula: Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n- Total Liabilities = $2,491,297.55 (from the balance sheet \"Total Current Liabilities\")\n- Total Assets = $14,089,860.66 (from the balance sheet \"Total Assets\")\n- Debt to Asset Ratio = $2,491,297.55 / $14,089,860.66 = 0.1768\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\nThe Gross Profit Margin shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds cost of goods sold.\n- Formula: (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\n- Gross Profit = $1,535,951.24 (from the income statement)\n- Total Revenue = $7,825,951.24 (from the income statement)\n- Gross Profit Margin = ($1,535,951.24 / $7,825,951.24) × 100% = 19.63%\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThe Operating Cash Flow Ratio measures a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from operations.\n- Formula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$4,398,760.38 (from the cash flow statement)\n- Total Current Liabilities = $2,491,297.55 (from the balance sheet)\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -$4,398,760.38 / $2,491,297.55 = -1.77\n\nRounding appropriately:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.18', 'Gross Profit Margin': '19.63%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.77'} }\n```",
