This ratio is calculated as:\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = |Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities| / |Net Profit|\n\nLet me extract the relevant values from the cash flow statement:\n\n- Net Profit: -$1,401,436.89\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -$4,398,760.38\n\nFor the ratio calculation, I'll use the absolute values of both numbers:\n|Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities| = $4,398,760.38\n|Net Profit| = $1,401,436.89\n\nNow I can calculate the ratio:\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = $4,398,760.38 / $1,401,436.89 = 3.14\n\nLet me round to two decimal places:\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = 3.14\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '3.14'}}\n```",
