                        "content": "I'll calculate the three financial ratios step by step.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nThis ratio measures the relationship between cash flow from operations and net income.\n\nFormula: OCF to Net Income Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit (absolute value)\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$4,398,760.38\n- Net Profit = -$1,401,436.89\n\nOCF to Net Income Ratio = |-$4,398,760.38| / |-$1,401,436.89| = $4,398,760.38 / $1,401,436.89 = 3.14\n\n## 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate revenue.\n\nFormula: Current Assets Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Current Assets\n\nTotal Revenue = $7,825,951.24\nAverage Current Assets = (Initial Current Assets + Ending Current Assets) / 2\nAverage Current Assets = ($8,000,000.00 + $8,810,936.45) / 2 = $8,405,468.23\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = $7,825,951.24 / $8,405,468.23 = 0.93\n\n## 3. Quick Ratio\n\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n\nFormula: Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nCurrent Assets (ending) = $8,810,936.45\nInventory (ending) = $3,540,000.00\nCurrent Liabilities (ending) = $2,491,297.55\n\nQuick Ratio = ($8,810,936.45 - $3,540,000.00) / $2,491,297.55 = $5,270,936.45 / $2,491,297.55 = 2.12\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"3.14\", \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.93\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"2.12\"}}\n```",
