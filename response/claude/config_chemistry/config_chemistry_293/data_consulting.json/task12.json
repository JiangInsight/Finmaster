The formula for ROE is:\n\nROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity\n\nStep 1: Find the Net Income (Net Profit)\nFrom the income statement, Net Profit = -1,401,436.89\n\nStep 2: Calculate Average Shareholders' Equity\nBeginning Shareholders' Equity (from initial balance sheet) = 13,000,000.00\nEnding Shareholders' Equity (from end balance sheet) = 11,598,563.11\n\nAverage Shareholders' Equity = (13,000,000.00 + 11,598,563.11) / 2 = 12,299,281.56\n\nStep 3: Calculate ROE\nROE = -1,401,436.89 / 12,299,281.56 = -0.1139 or -11.39%\n\nTherefore, the company's Return on Equity (ROE) is -11.39%, indicating that the company is generating negative returns on its equity investments during this period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '-11.39%'}}\n```",
