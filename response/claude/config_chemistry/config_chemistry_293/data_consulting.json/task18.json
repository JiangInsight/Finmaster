From the cash flow statement:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,398,760.38\n\n2. From the balance sheet:\n   - Total Current Liabilities (End amount) = 2,491,297.55\n\n3. Calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\n   - Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n   - Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -4,398,760.38 / 2,491,297.55\n   - Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -1.7656... (rounded to 2 decimal places: -1.77)\n\nThe negative ratio indicates that the company's operations are not generating enough cash to cover its current liabilities.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.77'} }\n```",
