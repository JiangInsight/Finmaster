Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's financial leverage by dividing total liabilities by total equity.\n\nFormula: Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = $2,491,297.55\n- Total Owner's Equity = $11,598,563.11\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $2,491,297.55 / $11,598,563.11 = 0.2148 ≈ 0.21\n\n## 2. Net Profit Margin\nThis ratio shows how much of each dollar of revenue is converted into net profit.\n\nFormula: Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = -$1,401,436.89\n- Total Revenue = $7,825,951.24\n\nNet Profit Margin = (-$1,401,436.89 / $7,825,951.24) × 100% = -17.91%\n\n## 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay off short-term debt with cash generated from operations.\n\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the statements:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$4,398,760.38\n- Total Current Liabilities = $2,491,297.55\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -$4,398,760.38 / $2,491,297.55 = -1.77\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21', 'Net Profit Margin': '-17.91%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.77'} }\n```",
