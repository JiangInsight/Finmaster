                        "content": "I'll calculate the requested financial ratios step by step, based on the given financial statements.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow generated from operations.\nFormula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$4,398,760.38\nTotal Current Liabilities = $2,491,297.55\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -$4,398,760.38 / $2,491,297.55 = -1.77\n\n## 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nThis measures the ability to pay off debts with the cash flow from operations.\nFormula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Liabilities\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -$4,398,760.38\nTotal Liabilities = $2,491,297.55 (since there are no long-term liabilities mentioned)\n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -$4,398,760.38 / $2,491,297.55 = -1.77\n\n## 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how many times inventory is sold and replaced during a period.\nFormula: Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nCost of Goods Sold = $6,290,000.00\nAverage Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2 = ($0 + $3,540,000.00) / 2 = $1,770,000.00\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio = $6,290,000.00 / $1,770,000.00 = 3.55\n\n## 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis measures the company's financial leverage.\nFormula: Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\nTotal Liabilities = $2,491,297.55\nTotal Equity = $11,598,563.11\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = $2,491,297.55 / $11,598,563.11 = 0.21\n\n## 5. Quick Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\nFormula: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nCurrent Assets - Inventory = $8,810,936.45 - $3,540,000.00 = $5,270,936.45\nCurrent Liabilities = $2,491,297.55\n\nQuick Ratio = $5,270,936.45 / $2,491,297.55 = 2.12\n\n## 6. Current Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations.\nFormula: Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nCurrent Assets = $8,810,936.45\nCurrent Liabilities = $2,491,297.55\n\nCurrent Ratio = $8,810,936.45 / $2,491,297.55 = 3.54\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.77', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.77', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '3.55', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21', 'Quick Ratio': '2.12', 'Current Ratio': '3.54'}}\n```",
