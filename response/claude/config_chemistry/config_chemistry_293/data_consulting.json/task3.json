This ratio is calculated by dividing Total Liabilities by Total Assets.\n\nStep 1: Identify the Total Liabilities from the balance sheet.\n- From the balance sheet, the Total Current Liabilities at the end date (2024-01-30) is $2,491,297.55.\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so the Total Liabilities is $2,491,297.55.\n\nStep 2: Identify the Total Assets from the balance sheet.\n- From the balance sheet, the Total Assets at the end date (2024-01-30) is $14,089,860.66.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio.\n- Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n- Debt to Asset Ratio = $2,491,297.55 / $14,089,860.66\n- Debt to Asset Ratio = 0.17682\n\nStep 4: Round to two decimal places.\n- Debt to Asset Ratio = 0.18 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.18\"}}\n```",
