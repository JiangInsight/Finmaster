                        "content": "I'll calculate each financial ratio step by step using the provided financial statements.\n\n## 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to pay its current liabilities from its operating cash flow.\n- Operating Cash Flow = -4,398,760.38\n- Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\n- Ratio = -4,398,760.38 ÷ 2,491,297.55 = -1.77\n\n## 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio indicates the proportion of debt to equity financing.\n- Total Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\n- Total Equity = 11,598,563.11\n- Ratio = 2,491,297.55 ÷ 11,598,563.11 = 0.21\n\n## 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n- Revenue = 7,825,951.24\n- Total Assets = 14,089,860.66\n- Ratio = 7,825,951.24 ÷ 14,089,860.66 = 0.56\n\n## 4. Quick Ratio\nThis measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations without selling inventory.\n- Quick Assets = Cash + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable\n- Quick Assets = 1,753,673.43 + 1,522,888.62 + 1,988,616.02 + 5,758.38 = 5,270,936.45\n- Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\n- Ratio = 5,270,936.45 ÷ 2,491,297.55 = 2.12\n\n## 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis measures how well current liabilities are covered by cash flow from operations.\n- Operating Cash Flow = -4,398,760.38\n- Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\n- Ratio = -4,398,760.38 ÷ 2,491,297.55 = -1.77\n\n## 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\nThis measures how efficiently a company uses its equity to generate profits.\n- Net Profit = -1,401,436.89\n- Total Equity = 11,598,563.11\n- ROE = (-1,401,436.89 ÷ 11,598,563.11) × 100 = -12.08%\n\n## 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\n- Revenue = 7,825,951.24\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 1,988,616.02) ÷ 2 = 994,308.01\n- Ratio = 7,825,951.24 ÷ 994,308.01 = 7.87\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.77', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.56', 'Quick Ratio': '2.12', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.77', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '-12.08%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.87'} }\n```",
