The recorded_type is \"Depreciation\" but the invoice describes it as a \"Sale\"\n2. The recorded_date is \"2024-01-31\" but the invoice mentions \"January 26, 2024\"\n3. The recorded_amount is $47,350.21 but the invoice mentions $39,663.30\n4. The recorded_unit_price is $10,858.57 but the invoice states $13,221.10\n5. The recorded_tax_amount is $45,044.82 but the invoice mentions $1,983.17\n\nThe values from the invoice are more likely to be correct, as invoices are official documents that have gone through verification.\n\nLet me check for any other inconsistencies in the data.\n\nI'm not seeing other clear inconsistencies in the other transactions where the invoice description contradicts the recorded fields.\n\nTherefore, I'll provide the solution for the \"Sale20240126059\" transaction:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"id\": \"Sale20240126059\",\n  \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n  \"Recorded category\": \"Depreciation\",\n  \"Original date\": \"2024-01-26\",\n  \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-31\",\n  \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n  \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n  \"Original payment_method\": null,\n  \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n  \"Original quantity\": \"3.0\",\n  \"Recorded quantity\": \"3.0\",\n  \"Original price\": \"13221.10\",\n  \"Recorded price\": \"10858.57\",\n  \"Original receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n  \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n  \"Original amount\": \"39663.30\",\n  \"Recorded amount\": \"47350.21\",\n  \"Original tax\": \"1983.17\",\n  \"Recorded tax\": \"45044.82\",\n  \"Original profit\": \"9663.30\",\n  \"Recorded profit\": \"9663.30\",\n  \"Original Preparer\": null,\n  \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n  \"Original Approver\": null,\n  \"Recorded Approver\": null\n}}\n```",
