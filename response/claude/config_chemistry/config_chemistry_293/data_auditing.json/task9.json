The cost amount for this transaction was $40000.00, with a tax amount of $2514.47, leading to a total amount due of $47774.85.\"\n- However, the recorded tax amount is $45270.82, which is inconsistent with the invoice's tax amount of $2514.47\n- This is clearly an error as the tax amount should be much smaller than the total amount.\n- The correct tax amount according to the invoice is $2514.47\n\nSimilarly, looking at transaction `Sale20240108014` from the original problem statement:\n- While not in the current dataset, the example solution identified an inconsistency where the recorded tax amount was $246948.27 but should have been $12565.31\n\nLooking through the rest of the dataset, I found only one clear inconsistency in the `Sale20240130068` transaction.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': '2514.47', 'Recorded tax': '45270.82', 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240130068'} }\n```",
