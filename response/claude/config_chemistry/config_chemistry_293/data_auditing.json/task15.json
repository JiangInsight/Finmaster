The recorded_type is \"Sales Expenses\" but the invoice describes it as a \"Sale\"\n2. The recorded_quantity is 3.0 but the invoice mentions 4.0 units\n3. The recorded_amount (72578.16) doesn't match the total in the invoice (96770.88)\n4. The invoice shows a total based on 4 units at $24192.72 per unit = $96770.88, not the recorded amount\n\nWhen looking at the risk_issues column, it confirms these discrepancies: Original category = Sale, Recorded category = Sales Expenses, Original quantity = 4.0, Recorded quantity = 3.\n\nThis indicates that this transaction was incorrectly recorded. The correct values based on the invoice should be:\n- Category: Sale (not \"Sales Expenses\")\n- Quantity: 4.0 (not 3.0)\n- Amount: $96770.88 (not $72578.16)\n\nThe invoice is typically more reliable as it's a standardized document, and the risk_issues field confirms these discrepancies.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '4.0', 'Recorded quantity': '3.0', 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '96770.88', 'Recorded amount': '72578.16', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240105007'} }\n```",
