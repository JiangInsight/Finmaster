First, I'll check the \"Purchase20231231008\" transaction entry, as I notice some discrepancies:\n   - The recorded_type is \"Depreciation\" but the ID and invoice description indicate it's a \"Purchase\"\n   - The recorded_date is \"2024-01-10\" but the invoice mentions \"December 31, 2023\"\n   - The recorded unit price is \"111667.19\" while the invoice states \"$100000.00\"\n\nThis transaction is clearly miscategorized and has incorrect date and price information.\n\nThe invoice states: \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Purchase, consisting of 18.0 units at a unit price of $100000.00, totaling $1800000.00.\"\n\nHowever, the recorded information shows:\n- Type: Depreciation (rather than Purchase)\n- Date: 2024-01-10 (rather than 2023-12-31)\n- Unit price: 111667.19 (rather than 100000.0)\n\nTherefore, this transaction has multiple inconsistencies that need to be corrected.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Purchase', 'Recorded category': 'Depreciation', 'Original date': '2023-12-31', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-10', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '100000.0', 'Recorded price': '111667.19', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Purchase20231231008'} }\n```",
