Date: Invoice says January 22, but record shows February 8\n2. Unit price: Invoice says $137285.02, but record shows $149439.32\n3. Total amount: Invoice says $411855.06, but record shows $510668.67\n\nLet's also check `Sale20240130057`:\n- Transaction ID: Sale20240130057\n- Recorded date: 2024-02-01 \n- Recorded amount: 90992.35\n- Recorded price: 21750.10\n- Invoice states: \"On January 30, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 3.0 units at a unit price of $24766.75, totaling $74300.25.\"\n\nThis also shows inconsistencies:\n1. Date: Invoice says January 30, but record shows February 1\n2. Unit price: Invoice says $24766.75, but record shows $21750.10\n3. Total amount: Invoice says $74300.25, but record shows $90992.35\n\nFor all other transactions I've checked, I don't see clear inconsistencies between the recorded values and the invoice information.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": \"2024-01-22\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-02-08\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": \"137285.02\", \"Recorded price\": \"149439.32\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"411855.06\", \"Recorded amount\": \"510668.67\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240122050\"}}\n```",
