Inconsistencies between recorded information and invoice details\n2. Mismatches in transaction types, dates, amounts, or other fields\n3. Any other errors that can be detected by comparing different fields in the same row\n\nStarting with a systematic review of each entry:\n\nFor the transaction ID \"Interest20240115015\", I notice a significant discrepancy:\n- The recorded_type is \"Sale\" but the ID clearly indicates it should be an \"Interest Receivables\" transaction\n- The recorded_date is \"2024-02-01\" but the invoice states it occurred on \"January 15, 2024\"\n- The transaction ID (Interest20240115015) also indicates the date should be 2024-01-15\n\nThis is a clear mismatch where both the category and date are incorrectly recorded. The invoice text confirms this is an Interest Receivables transaction from January 15, 2024, not a Sale from February 1, 2024.\n\nFor the transaction ID \"Purchase20231231001\", the recorded information shows:\n- recorded_payment/receipt_status is \"Paid\"\n- recorded_preparer is \"Senior Staff\"\n- recorded_amount is \"280000.0\"\nThese appear consistent with the invoice details.\n\nContinuing through other entries, I also notice that in transaction \"Expense20240122001\", the recorded_type is \"Financial Expenses\" and the recorded_date is \"2024-01-31\", but the invoice indicates it should be an \"Administrative Expenses\" from \"January 22, 2024\".\n\nBased on my analysis, I've identified two transactions with clear inconsistencies. The most significant is Interest20240115015, which has both category and date errors.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Interest Receivables', 'Recorded category': 'Sale', 'Original date': '2024-01-15', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-01', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Interest20240115015'} }\n```",
