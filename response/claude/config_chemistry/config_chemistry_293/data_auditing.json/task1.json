There's an entry with recorded_type \"Sale\", but the invoice description says it's for \"Sales Expenses\":\n\n```\n| Expense20240113001 | Sale | 2024-01-13 | 16966.19 | Director | Senior Staff | Paid | Cash |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | On January 13, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sales Expenses, totaling $16966.19. The payment_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid. This transaction was prepared by Senior Staff, and the approver is Director. |\n```\n\nThe transaction ID starts with \"Expense\", but the recorded_type is \"Sale\". Looking at the invoice description, it clearly states that this is for \"Sales Expenses\" - not a sale of products. This is an obvious inconsistency.\n\nSince the invoice is typically the most reliable source and the transaction ID also indicates an expense, the recorded_type \"Sale\" appears to be incorrect and should be \"Sales Expenses\" instead.\n\nNo other fields appear to have inconsistencies in this transaction - the date, amount, approver, preparer, and payment status all match between the recorded fields and the invoice description.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Recorded category': 'Sale', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240113001'} }",
