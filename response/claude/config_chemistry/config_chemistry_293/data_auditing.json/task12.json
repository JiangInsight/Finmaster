Expense20240115001 (Administrative Expenses) shows empty recorded_approver, but the invoice states \"This transaction was prepared by Senior Staff, and the approver is Director.\"\n2. Expense20240121001 (Sales Expenses) shows empty recorded_approver, but the invoice states \"This transaction was prepared by Senior Staff, and the approver is Director.\"\n\nLooking at the other transactions, I don't see any amounts, dates, or other fields that contradict what's in the invoice descriptions.\n\nFor Purchase20231231001, the original recorded_payment/receipt_status is \"Paid\" which matches the invoice statement that \"this transaction was paid\".\n\nThe primary inconsistencies are with the missing approvers in the two expense transactions where the invoices clearly state Director as the approver.\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': 'Director', 'Recorded Approver': 'None', 'id': 'Expense20240121001'} }",
