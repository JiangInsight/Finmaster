Looking at the recorded information:\n   - Recorded date: \"2024-02-07\"\n   - Recorded quantity: \"2.0\"\n   - Recorded unit price: \"25778.19\"\n   - Recorded amount: \"44843.7\"\n   - Recorded after tax amount: \"85203.03\"\n\n2. According to the invoice description:\n   - \"On January 18, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 4.0 units at a unit price of $22421.85, totaling $89687.40.\"\n   - Cost amount: \"$80000.00\" \n   - Tax amount: \"$4484.37\"\n   - Total amount due: \"$85203.03\"\n\nThere are clear inconsistencies:\n- Date mismatch: Recorded as Feb 7, but invoice says Jan 18\n- Quantity mismatch: Recorded as 2 units, invoice says 4 units\n- Unit price mismatch: Recorded as $25778.19, invoice says $22421.85\n- Total amount mismatch: Recorded as $44843.70, invoice says $89687.40\n\nThe invoice information appears more consistent (4 units × $22421.85 = $89687.40), while the recorded data is internally inconsistent (2 units × $25778.19 ≠ $44843.70).\n\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-18', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-07', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '4.0', 'Recorded quantity': '2.0', 'Original price': '22421.85', 'Recorded price': '25778.19', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '89687.40', 'Recorded amount': '44843.7', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240118039'} }",
