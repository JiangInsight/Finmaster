The invoice appears to be more reliable as it provides detailed information about the transaction.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Depreciation', 'Original date': '2024-01-28', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-30', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '5.0', 'Recorded quantity': '5.0', 'Original price': '12369.32', 'Recorded price': '12369.32', 'Original receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Original amount': '61846.60', 'Recorded amount': '71523.82', 'Original tax': '3092.33', 'Recorded tax': '3092.33', 'Original profit': '11846.60', 'Recorded profit': '11846.60', 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240128065'} }\n```",
