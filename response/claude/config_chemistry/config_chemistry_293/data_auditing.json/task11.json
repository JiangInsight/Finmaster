Missing values where the invoice indicates information should exist\n2. Discrepancies between recorded fields and the invoice description\n3. Calculation errors (e.g., quantity × price ≠ amount)\n\nExamining the transactions row by row:\n\nFor transaction \"Expense20240115001\" (Sales Expenses), I notice a clear inconsistency:\n- The recorded_preparer field is empty\n- However, the invoice states: \"This transaction was prepared by Staff, and the approver is Director\"\n\nThis is a clear case where the recorded_preparer field is incorrect (missing) compared to the more reliable invoice information.\n\nFor \"Purchase20231231001\", the invoice indicates it was paid via bank transfer, prepared by Senior Staff with total amount $280,000, which matches the recorded fields.\n\nContinuing through all transactions, no other inconsistencies appear between the recorded values and the invoice descriptions.\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': 'Staff', 'Recorded Preparer': 'None', 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240115001'} }\n```",
