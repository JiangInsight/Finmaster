Transaction ID: Expense20240115001\n   - Recorded date: 2024-02-08\n   - Recorded amount: 37081.16\n   - Invoice states: \"On January 15, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Administrative Expenses, totaling $32885.32.\"\n   - The date and amount in the recorded fields don't match what's in the invoice.\n\n2.
