Transaction ID: `Expense20240118001`\n   - The invoice states \"On January 18, 2024...\" but the recorded date is January 22, 2024\n   - This is an internal inconsistency between the invoice date and the recorded date\n\n2. Transaction ID: `Expense20240129001`\n   - The invoice states \"On January 29, 2024...\" but the recorded date is February 14, 2024\n   - This is an internal inconsistency between the invoice date and the recorded date\n\nLet me check for any other inconsistencies...\n\nI've reviewed the other transactions and these two appear to be the only ones with clear inconsistencies between the invoice information and the recorded data.\n\nFor the first transaction (Expense20240118001), the original date should be January 18, 2024 based on the invoice, but it was recorded as January 22, 2024.\n\nFor the second transaction (Expense20240129001), the original date should be January 29, 2024 based on the invoice, but it was recorded as February 14, 2024.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-18', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-22', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': null, 'Recorded price': null, 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Expense20240118001'} }\n```",
