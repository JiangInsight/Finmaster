The recorded amount of 280000.0 matches the calculated total (28.0 units Ã— 10000.0 per unit).\n\nGoing through the entries systematically, I notice a significant discrepancy in Purchase20231231011:\n1. The recorded_type is \"Financial Expenses\" but the transaction ID \"Purchase20231231011\" indicates this should be a purchase\n2. The invoice clearly states this is a Purchase transaction\n3. The recorded_unit_price (9636.48) doesn't match the recorded_cost_per_unit (10000.0)\n4. The total amount of 260000.0 is consistent with 26 units at 10000.0 per unit, not at 9636.48 per unit\n\nThis indicates that both the transaction type and unit price are incorrectly recorded for Purchase20231231011.\n\nSince the invoice is generally considered more reliable, and the transaction ID and total amount are consistent with a purchase of 26 units at 10000.0 per unit, I can conclude that:\n- The correct category should be \"Purchase\" rather than \"Financial Expenses\"\n- The correct unit price should be 10000.0 rather than 9636.48\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Purchase', 'Recorded category': 'Financial Expenses', 'Original date': null, 'Recorded date': null, 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '10000.0', 'Recorded price': '9636.48', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': null, 'Recorded amount': null, 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Purchase20231231011'} }\n```",
