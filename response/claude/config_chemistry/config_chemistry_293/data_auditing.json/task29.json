Date discrepancy:\n   - Recorded date: 2024-02-01\n   - Invoice states: \"On January 05, 2024, an invoice was issued...\"\n   - The invoice date (January 05) should be more reliable than the recorded date (February 01)\n\n2. Amount discrepancy:\n   - Recorded amount: 120923.05\n   - Invoice states: \"...totaling $96770.88\"\n   - The invoice amount is likely correct\n\n3. Unit price discrepancy:\n   - Recorded price: 24134.52\n   - Invoice states: \"...at a unit price of $24192.72\"\n   - The invoice unit price is likely correct\n\n4. Tax amount discrepancy:\n   - Recorded tax: 82109.68\n   - Invoice states: \"...with a tax amount of $4838.54\"\n   - The recorded tax is unusually high (about 68% of total instead of normal 5%)\n   - The invoice tax amount is likely correct\n\nI can confirm this is correct by calculating:\n- 4 units × $24192.72 = $96770.88 (matches invoice total)\n- $96770.88 × 5% tax rate = approximately $4838.54 (matches invoice tax)\n\nTherefore, the inconsistency is in the recorded values compared to the invoice values.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': null, 'Recorded category': null, 'Original date': '2024-01-05', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-01', 'Original payment/receipt_status': null, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': null, 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': null, 'Recorded quantity': null, 'Original price': '24192.72', 'Recorded price': '24134.52', 'Original receive_method': null, 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '96770.88', 'Recorded amount': '120923.05', 'Original tax': '4838.54', 'Recorded tax': '82109.68', 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240105007'} }\n```",
