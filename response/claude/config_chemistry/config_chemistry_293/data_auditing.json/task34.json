The cost amount for this transaction was $50000.00, with a tax amount of $3218.73, leading to a total amount due of $61155.92. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\nInconsistencies:\n1. Category: Recorded as \"Financial Expenses\" but should be \"Sale\" (consistent with ID and invoice)\n2. Date: Recorded as 2024-01-11 but invoice shows 2024-01-04\n3. Quantity: Recorded as 6.0 but invoice shows 5.0\n4. Unit price: Recorded as $13,052.98 but invoice shows $12,874.93\n5. Tax amount: Recorded as $49,462.80 but invoice shows $3,218.73\n\nThe transaction has multiple inconsistencies, and the invoice information appears to be the correct source of truth.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Financial Expenses', 'Original date': '2024-01-04', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-11', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': null, 'Recorded payment_method': null, 'Original quantity': '5.0', 'Recorded quantity': '6.0', 'Original price': '12874.93', 'Recorded price': '13052.98', 'Original receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Original amount': '64374.65', 'Recorded amount': '77249.58', 'Original tax': '3218.73', 'Recorded tax': '49462.80', 'Original profit': '14374.65', 'Recorded profit': '14374.65', 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Sale20240104005'} }\n```",
