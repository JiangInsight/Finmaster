From the problem, \"Total Revenue\" is 2,869,560.42.\n3. This item is composed of 1 component sub-item from the input statement: \"Main Business Revenue\" which also has the same value: 2,869,560.42.\n4. For the sub-item, we are to output its initial and final values. Since we have one value listed (at the date), both initial and final values are the same: 2,869,560.42.\n\nFinal output according to the format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"2869560.42\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"2869560.42\"}}\n```",
