Since its initial value was zero and it increased to 91,509.25 by the end date, this increase corresponds to the depreciation expense recognized during the period.\n\nHence, the initial value of expense is 0.00 and the end value is 91509.25.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"91509.25\"}}\n```",
