The amount of interest accrued but not yet received (typically from the Balance Sheet or as Interest Income from the Income Statement).\n2. The net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period (from the Cash Flow Statement).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify interest accrued but not yet received\n\n- From the Balance Sheet under \"Interest Receivable\", the **End_amount** is 14,575.80.\n- From the Income Statement, \"Interest Income\" is 14,575.80.\n- From the Cash Flow Statement, \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" is -14,575.80.\n\nThe accrued interest is generally represented by the \"Interest Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet. The value is 14,575.80.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\n- In the Cash Flow Statement under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\":\n  - Beginning Balance: 8,000,000.00\n  - Ending Balance: 7,349,369.78\n  - Net Increase: -650,630.22\n\nThis means cash and cash equivalents decreased by 650,630.22 (net addition is negative).\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n- value1 (Interest accrued but not yet received): \"14575.80\"\n- value2 (Net addition in cash and cash equivalents): \"-650630.22\"\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '14575.80', 'value2': '-650630.22'} }\n```",
