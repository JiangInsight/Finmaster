                        "content": "Let's identify and extract the required three values step-by-step:\n\n1. **End value of profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense:**  \n   This corresponds to \"Profit Before Tax\" from the Income Statement.  \n   From the income statement table:  \n   **Profit Before Tax = 1049228.78**\n\n2. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period:**  \n   This corresponds to the increase in \"Accounts Payable\" from the Balance Sheet, showing what the company owes for purchases made on credit.  \n   From the balance sheet table:  \n   Initial Accounts Payable = 0.00  \n   End Accounts Payable = 485000.00  \n   So, addition = 485000.00\n\n3. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares:**  \n   This corresponds to \"Paid-in Capital\" from the Balance Sheet.  \n   From the balance sheet table:  \n   Paid-in Capital (End_amount) = 13000000.00\n\n**Now categorize these by financial statement in the order given:**\n\n- Balance Sheet:  \n  - Capital contributed by shareholders = Paid-in Capital = 13000000.00  \n  - Addition in amount owed = Accounts Payable = 485000.00  \n\n- Income Statement:  \n  - Profit before tax = 1049228.78\n\n- Cash Flow Statement:  \n  - The instructions suggest grouping outputs by statement order: 1. Balance Sheet, 2. Income Statement, 3. Cash Flow Statement.  \n  - The three required values come from Balance Sheet and Income Statement mainly. The problem's example showed just values from balance sheet, income statement, and balance sheet item for amount owed. Here no relevant value specifically stated for cash flow other than the problem mentions only these three values.  \n  - The addition in amount owed is from balance sheet  \n  - Capital contributed by shareholders is from balance sheet  \n  - Profit before tax is from income statement  \n  - So the third required item is \"capital contributed\" from balance sheet.  \n  - The problem example grouped them as: 1. Balance Sheet  (capital contributed), 2. Income Statement (profit before tax), 3. Cash Flow Statement (addition owed). But here increase in accounts payable is from balance sheet itself.  \n  - In cash flow statement, \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" = 485000.00, matching the balance sheet increase.  \n  - Given the example, the \"addition in amount owed\" value is chosen from balance sheet or cash flow statement (amount is the same), but output shows \"value3\" as amount owed.  \n  Therefore for conformity:  \n  - value1 = Capital contributed by shareholders (Balance Sheet) = 13000000.00  \n  - value2 = Profit before tax (Income Statement) = 1049228.78  \n  - value3 = Addition in amount owed (from cash flow statement line \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\") = 485000.00  \n\n**Final solution JSON:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"13000000.00\", \"value2\": \"1049228.78\", \"value3\": \"485000.00\"}}\n```",
