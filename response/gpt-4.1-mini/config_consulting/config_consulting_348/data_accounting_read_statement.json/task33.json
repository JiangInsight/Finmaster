The task requires extracting two specific line items from the income statement:\n   - Income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities.\n   - Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\n2. From the provided income statement, the typical line item for income from core operating activities is “Main Business Revenue” (or similar), which represents the revenue generated from main operations.\n\n3. The carrying amount of inventories sold corresponds to the “Cost of Goods Sold.”\n\n4. Looking into the problem statement:\n\n| Account             | Amount    | Date       |\n|---------------------|-----------|------------|\n| Main Business Revenue| 2869560.42| 2024-02-05 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold   | 1249000.00| 2024-02-05 |\n\nThese two line items clearly map to the required values.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- value1 = \"2869560.42\" (Main Business Revenue)\n- value2 = \"1249000.00\" (Cost of Goods Sold)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"2869560.42\", \"value2\": \"1249000.00\"}}\n```",
