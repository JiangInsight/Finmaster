Look at the \"Accounts Payable\" line in the balance sheet:\n   - Initial amount (2023-12-31): 0.00\n   - End amount (2024-02-05): 485000.00\n\n2. The increase (addition) is:  \n   485000.00 - 0.00 = 485000.00\n\n3. This increase represents the entity's addition to amounts owed for goods or services received on credit.\n\nThus, the value to report is 485000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '485000.00'} }\n```",
