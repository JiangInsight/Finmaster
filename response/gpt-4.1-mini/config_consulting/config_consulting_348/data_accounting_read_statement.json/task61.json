The cash payments made to acquire property, plant, and equipment or other long-term assets.\n\nStep 1: Identify the line item related to costs incurred to secure and deliver orders.\n\n- From the income statement, typical relevant line items are \"Selling Expenses\" and possibly part of \"Administrative Expenses\".\n- \"Selling Expenses\" typically includes costs to secure and deliver customer orders.\n\nIn the income statement, \"Selling Expenses\" is 309,942.03.\n\nStep 2: Identify the cash payment to acquire property, plant, and equipment or long-term assets.\n\n- From the cash flow statement, the related line item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n- This line shows 0.00, which means no cash payments were made to acquire fixed assets during the period.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- value1 (costs incurred to secure and deliver): 309,942.03 (Selling Expenses)\n- value2 (cash payments to acquire fixed assets): 0.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"309942.03\", \"value2\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
