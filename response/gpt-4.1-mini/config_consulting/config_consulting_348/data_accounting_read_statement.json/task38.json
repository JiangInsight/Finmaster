In cash flow statements, this is typically represented by \"Accounts Receivable.\"\n\nHere, the relevant line is:\n\n|(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -2149792.45 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nSince it's negative, it indicates an increase in accounts receivable (more amounts owed to the entity), but the problem requests the \"decrease\" in amounts owed, so the raw number associated is -2149792.45. But since it's recorded as \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable,\" a negative number means an increase in Accounts Receivable, and a positive number means a decrease.\n\nTherefore, the value for decrease in amounts owed to the entity (i.e., decrease in accounts receivable) is -2149792.45.\n\nHence, according to the problem statement, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-2149792.45\"}}\n```\n\n# Final answer:  \n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-2149792.45\"}}\n```",
