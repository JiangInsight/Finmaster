                        "content": "Step-by-step reasoning:  \n- The costs to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services usually include \"Selling Expenses\" and \"Cost of Goods Sold\" because:  \n  - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) represents the direct costs of producing the goods sold by the company, a clear delivery cost.  \n  - Selling Expenses represent costs related to selling activities, which involve securing customer orders (marketing, sales staff, commissions, etc.).  \n\n- According to the problem statement, we need to identify and extract specific line items and the value related to costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services.  \n- From the income statement:  \n  - Cost of Goods Sold = 1,249,000.00  \n  - Selling Expenses = 309,942.03  \n- Administrative Expenses and others are not related to securing orders or delivery directly.  \n- Since the examples use only Selling Expenses as the value, but logically both COGS and Selling Expenses are relevant here.  \n- However, the example solution only extracted Selling Expenses, presumably because COGS is considered production cost, not necessarily cost to secure orders.  \n- The example solution emphasized \"costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services.\"  \n- \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is cost to deliver goods and services, so it should be included.  \n- \"Selling Expenses\" are cost to secure customer orders (marketing, sales).  \n\nTherefore, to be accurate, both should be considered, but since the task is based on the example which only extracts selling expenses, the best fit here is to extract \"Selling Expenses\" as the direct cost to secure customer orders and \"Cost of Goods Sold\" as the cost to deliver goods and services.  \n\nIf the solution expects a single value, adding the two together:\n\n1249000.00 + 309942.03 = 1,558,942.03\n\nOtherwise, if only Selecting one line item, prefer Selling Expenses (per example).\n\nGiven no further instructions, and following the example, the best answer is \"309942.03\" as the cost to secure customer orders.\n\nIf both costs incurred were needed, the sum or both values should be provided.\n\nGiven the task's wording: \"identify and extract the specific line items and value of costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services,\" I believe both should be extracted.\n\nTherefore, two line items:  \n- Cost of Goods Sold: 1249000.00  \n- Selling Expenses: 309942.03\n\nSince the example solution only shows a single value field, possibly the sum or key value.\n\nI will provide the sum of both.\n\nFinal:  \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"1558942.03\"}}\n```\n\n# Final answer:  \n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"1558942.03\"}}\n```",
