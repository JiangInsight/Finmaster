Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nWithin each group, we keep the original line item order.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify line item for \"funds deposit into a bank\":**\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- The line \"Bank Deposits\" represents funds deposited into a bank.\n- Value to extract: End_amount under \"Bank Deposits\"\n\nValue = 4,292,000.00\n\n2. **Identify line item for \"income earned by an entity from financial assets\":**\n\nLook for income related to financial assets in the Income Statement or Balance Sheet.\n\nFrom Income Statement:\n- \"Interest Income\" corresponds to income earned from financial assets.\n- Value = 14,575.80\n\n3. **Check Cash Flow Statement:**\n\nNo direct line item labeled as \"funds deposit into a bank\" or \"income from financial assets\" is present except net profit and changes in receivables.\n\nTherefore, select from Balance Sheet and Income Statement.\n\n---\n\n**Final extracted values:**\n\n- From Balance Sheet: Bank Deposits = 4292000.00\n- From Income Statement: Interest Income = 14575.80\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"4292000.00\", \"value2\": \"14575.80\"}}\n```",
