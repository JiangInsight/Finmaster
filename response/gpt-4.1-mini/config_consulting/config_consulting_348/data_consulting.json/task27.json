                        "content": "To solve the problem, let us calculate all three ratios step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nFormula:  \nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Net Income)  \n\nFrom cash flow statement:  \n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -650,630.22  \nFrom income statement:  \n- Net Profit (Net Income) = 905,750.76  \n\nCalculation:  \n= -650,630.22 / 905,750.76 ≈ -0.7187 (negative sign indicates operating cash flow is negative while net income is positive)  \n\nWe'll keep 2 decimal places:  \nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = -0.72\n\n---\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\nThe example uses \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\" as a ratio of Total Revenue to Average Current Assets.\n\nFormula:  \nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Current Assets  \n\nTotal Revenue from income statement = 2,869,560.42  \n\nCalculate Average Current Assets:  \nInitial Total Current Assets (2023-12-31) = 8,000,000.00  \nEnding Total Current Assets (2024-02-05) = 9,625,738.03  \n\nAverage Current Assets = (8,000,000 + 9,625,738.03) / 2 = 8,812,869.015  \n\nCalculation:  \n= 2,869,560.42 / 8,812,869.015 ≈ 0.3256  \n\nRounded to 2 decimals: 0.33\n\n---\n\n### 3. Quick Ratio\n\nFormula:  \nQuick Ratio = (Quick Assets) / (Current Liabilities)  \nWhere:  \nQuick Assets = Cash + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable  \nCurrent Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities from balance sheet = 628,478.02  \n\nFrom end amounts (2024-02-05):  \n- Cash on Hand = 3,057,369.78  \n- Bank Deposits = 4,292,000.00  \n- Interest Receivable = 14,575.80  \n- Accounts Receivable = 2,149,792.45  \n\nSum Quick Assets:  \n= 3,057,369.78 + 4,292,000.00 + 14,575.80 + 2,149,792.45 = 9,513,738.03  \n\nQuick Ratio = 9,513,738.03 / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.14  \n\nRounded to 2 decimals: 15.14  \n\n---\n\n### Final results:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-0.72\", \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.33\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"15.14\"}}\n```",
