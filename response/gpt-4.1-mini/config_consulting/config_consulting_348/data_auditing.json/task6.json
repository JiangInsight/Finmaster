Generally, product ids and suppliers are consistent; here, S003 appears linked to Supplier 3 in other entries. The supplier and product mismatch suggests an error. The quantity and price total is consistent with unit price times quantity, so the amount seems correct. The inconsistency lies in the supplier-product relation, suggesting either supplier or product_id is incorrectly recorded.\n\n- For Sale20240202065, the recorded unit price (11452.46) does not match the total amount (10969.01) which represents the sale price. Given invoice amounts, the correct unit price should be 10969.01. So unit price recorded is incorrect and should be corrected.\n\nNo other significant internal inconsistencies like date, payment method, status, tax or profit were detected in the excerpt above.",
