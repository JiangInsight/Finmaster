Initial bank deposit only.\n\nCash inflows by bank receipts unclear or absent.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Bank expenses paid in cash? No.\n\nOnly cash outflows paid by bank reduce bank cash equivalents.\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: Sum up net cash and equivalents changes:\n\nInitial total = 8,000,000  \nMinus bank paid purchases = -4,218,000  \nNet from cash (inflows - outflows) = -12,552.80 (previous step)  \nAdd unidentified bank inflows? No data\n\nFinal net = 8,000,000 - 4,218,000 - 12,552.80 = 3,769,447.20\n\n---\n\n### Interim conclusion:\n\nThe net amount of purchases decreases bank cash from initial deposit by 4,218,000. Cash inflows and outflows net a slight cash decrease of -12,552.80. The net of cash and bank cash = 3,769,447.20 increase from zero or initial baseline.\n\n---\n\n### Step 10: Cross-check if any cash inflows from bank deposits (besides initial) are there, or cash equivalents inflows from other sources:\n\nPurchase20231231001: Unpaid account payable no effect.  \nNo clear additional bank deposits or inflows except initial 5,000,000.\n\n---\n\n### Step 11: Summary:\n\n- Initial cash+bank = 8,000,000  \n- Less purchase paid by bank transfer: 4,218,000  \n- Net cash flow from cash sales/expenses: -12,552.80\n\nThus, net increase in cash and cash equivalents = -4,218,000 (bank payment) + (-12,552.80) (cash net) = approximately -4,230,552.80\n\nSince initial is 8,000,000, final should be 8,000,000 - 4,230,552.80 = 3,769,447.20, same.\n\n---\n\n### Step 12: Format answer\n\nRepresent net increase in cash and cash equivalents relative to the starting point. Since initial balances are given, generally net change is final minus initial.\n\n- Initial cash and bank: 8,000,000  \n- Total payments by bank and cash: purchases + expenses paid  \n- Total receipts in cash only: sales receipts  \n- No explicit bank inflows except initial deposit  \n\nSo net increase over period:\n\nNet increase = Cash sales inflow - cash paid out - bank purchases paid\n\nNet increase = 401,935.23 - 331,488.03 - 4,218,000 = -4,147,552.80 (cash + bank)\n\n---\n\n### Final solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"-4147552.80\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n# **Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"-4147552.80\"}}\n```",
