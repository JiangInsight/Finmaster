                        "content": "To calculate the accounts payable initial and ending values, we consider all transactions that relate to accounts payable:\n\n**Step 1: Identify initial accounts payable balance**\n\n- From the initial records, there are no explicit accounts payable amounts listed.\n- There are only initial amounts for Cash deposit, Bank deposit, and Fixed Assets.\n- Therefore, **Accounts Payable Initial Value = 0.00**\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify purchases on account (unpaid) that increase accounts payable**\n\nLook for purchases with:\n- `payment/receipt_status` = \"Unpaid\"\n- and `payment_method` = \"Account Payable\"\n\nFrom the data:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001: 60,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n2. Purchase20231231006: 60,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n3. Purchase20231231007: 10,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n4. Purchase20231231011: 300,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n5. Purchase20231231014: 2,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n6. Purchase20231231016: 40,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n7. Purchase20231231021: 3,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n8. Purchase20231231022: 10,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n\nSum of unpaid purchases (account payable):\n60,000 + 60,000 + 10,000 + 300,000 + 2,000 + 40,000 + 3,000 + 10,000 =  \n= 485,000.0\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Identify payments that reduce accounts payable**\n\nPayments made to suppliers for previously unpaid purchases reduce accounts payable.\n\nLook for purchases with:\n\n- `payment/receipt_status` = \"Paid\"\n- regardless of payment method, but only those related to purchases (type Purchase)\n\nPaid purchases amounts:\n\n- Purchase20231231002: 100,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231003: 3,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231004: 5,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231005: 15,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231008: 300,000.0 (Paid) *(supplier 10)*\n- Purchase20231231009: 20,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231010: 5,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231012: 60,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231013: 200,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231015: 3,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231018: 15,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231019: 60,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231020: 20,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231023: 60,000.0 (Paid)\n\nSum of paid purchases =  \n100,000 + 3,000 + 5,000 + 15,000 + 300,000 + 20,000 + 5,000 + 60,000 + 200,000 + 3,000 + 15,000 + 60,000 + 20,000 + 60,000 =  \n= 866,000.0\n\n*Note*: Paid purchases reduce accounts payable only if they were previously unpaid. Since initial accounts payable was zero and unpaid purchases total to 485,000, the paid purchases are either new purchases paid immediately (i.e., not affecting accounts payable) or payments for previous periods. For calculation of ending accounts payable, we only consider unpaid purchases still outstanding.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Calculate ending accounts payable**\n\nAccounts payable at end = Initial + Unpaid purchases - Payments related to accounts payable\n\nSince initial accounts payable is zero and  \nUnpaid purchases total: 485,000 (from step 2)\n\nAmong paid purchases, only those that are payments related to account payables reduce the balance. But without initial payable balance or payment details linking, we assume paid purchases are paid immediately, thus do not reduce accounts payable balance.\n\nTherefore, the ending accounts payable = sum of unpaid purchase amounts on account = 485,000.00\n\n---\n\n**Final result:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"485000.00\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\nIf we find any other unpaid purchases or paid related to accounts payable, adjustments needed. But based on provided data, this is the conclusion.",
