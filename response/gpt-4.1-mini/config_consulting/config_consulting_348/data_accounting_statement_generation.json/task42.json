Since tax_amount is absent there, assume zero input tax.\n\nTherefore, Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable = Sum of tax_amount of Sales - 0 = Sum of sales tax_amount.\n\nFrom the data, the Sales with tax_amount are listed; we will sum all tax_amount from Sale records.\n\n**Step 1: Sum tax_amount for all Sale records**\n\nFrom the problem data, the Sale entries and their tax_amount are (some samples):\n\n- Sale20240103002: 2118.29  \n- Sale20240103003: 10510.19  \n- Sale20240105007: 714.14  \n- Sale20240105008: 2897.35  \n- Sale20240105009: 103.73  \n- Sale20240106010: 489.44  \n- Sale20240106011: 148.59  \n- Sale20240107014: 2193.99  \n- Sale20240108015: 2688.52  \n- Sale20240112018: 489.74  \n- Sale20240115020: 539.57  \n- Sale20240115021: 2076.09  \n- Sale20240117024: 11012.82  \n- Sale20240117025: 2999.61  \n- Sale20240117026: 622.49  \n- Sale20240118028: 2866.06  \n- Sale20240118029: 12732.74  \n- Sale20240119031: 10118.06  \n- Sale20240120033: 484.4  \n- Sale20240121035: 11645.83  \n- Sale20240121036: 9430.35  \n- Sale20240123039: 2403.95  \n- Sale20240124041: 600.31  \n- Sale20240126044: 2630.0  \n- Sale20240126045: 10927.59  \n- Sale20240126046: 2497.59  \n- Sale20240128050: 554.8  \n- Sale20240128051: 2004.8  \n- Sale20240129053: 149.71  \n- Sale20240129054: 671.71  \n- Sale20240130055: 2781.94  \n- Sale20240131057: 2828.89  \n- Sale20240202063: 9767.16  \n- Sale20240202064: 685.47  \n- Sale20240202065: 548.45  \n- Sale20240203066: 132.94  \n- Sale20240203067: 142.12  \n- Sale20240203068: 136.74  \n\nLet's sum all these values:\n\n2118.29 + 10510.19 + 714.14 + 2897.35 + 103.73 + 489.44 + 148.59 + 2193.99 + 2688.52 + 489.74 + 539.57 + 2076.09 + 11012.82 + 2999.61 + 622.49 + 2866.06 + 12732.74 + 10118.06 + 484.4 + 11645.83 + 9430.35 + 2403.95 + 600.31 + 2630.0 + 10927.59 + 2497.59 + 554.8 + 2004.8 + 149.71 + 671.71 + 2781.94 + 2828.89 + 9767.16 + 685.47 + 548.45 + 132.94 + 142.12 + 136.74\n\nCalculating:\n\nSum part:\n\n- Step 1: 2118.29 + 10510.19 = 12628.48  \n- +714.14 = 13342.62  \n- +2897.35 = 16239.97  \n- +103.73 = 16343.7  \n- +489.44 = 16833.14  \n- +148.59 = 16981.73  \n- +2193.99 = 19175.72  \n- +2688.52 = 21864.24  \n- +489.74 = 22353.98  \n- +539.57 = 22893.55  \n- +2076.09 = 24969.64  \n- +11012.82 = 35982.46  \n- +2999.61 = 38982.07  \n- +622.49 = 39604.56  \n- +2866.06 = 42470.62  \n- +12732.74 = 55203.36  \n- +10118.06 = 65321.42  \n- +484.4 = 65805.82  \n- +11645.83 = 77451.65  \n- +9430.35 = 86882.0  \n- +2403.95 = 89285.95  \n- +600.31 = 89886.26  \n- +2630.0 = 92516.26  \n- +10927.59 = 103443.85  \n- +2497.59 = 105941.44  \n- +554.8 = 106496.24  \n- +2004.8 = 108501.04  \n- +149.71 = 108650.75  \n- +671.71 = 109322.46  \n- +2781.94 = 112104.4  \n- +2828.89 = 114933.29  \n- +9767.16 = 124700.45  \n- +685.47 = 125385.92  \n- +548.45 = 125934.37  \n- +132.94 = 126067.31  \n- +142.12 = 126209.43  \n- +136.74 = 126346.17  \n\nSo total output tax = 126346.17\n\nThere is no input tax data; hence, input tax = 0.\n\nSo,\n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Tax Payable = 126346.17 - 0 = 126346.17\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"126346.17\"}}\n```",
