The problem data table includes various transaction types, including purchases, sales, expenses, interest, and others.\n\n2. Focus only on transactions related to fixed assets purchase.\n\n3. In the example, fixed assets purchases were identified by the \"type\" field containing \"Fixed Assets\" or similar wording like \"Fixed Assets Purchase\".\n\n4. In the current problem data, there is no explicit \"Fixed Assets\" or \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" type provided in these data rows.\n\n5. All the \"Purchase\" entries seem to relate to goods/services (consulting, solutions), but none is labeled or shows fixed asset purchase like storage facilities or fixed asset name.\n\n6. Without explicit fixed assets purchase rows, we conclude that there is no fixed assets purchase amount in the given dataset.\n\n7. Therefore, the final purchase of fixed assets is 0.\n\nHence, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"0\"}}\n```",
