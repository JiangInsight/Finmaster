We assume it is zero (or not relevant for calculation as no initial accounts receivable entry is shown).\n\n2. **Identify all credit sales on account (Unpaid sales with \"Account Receviable\" as receive_method).**\n   - Add up the amounts of sales marked as Unpaid and receive_method \"Account Receviable\".\n   - This increases Accounts Receivable.\n\n3. **Identify cash receipts from customers related to accounts receivable (sales paid or any cash collections from receivables).**\n   - Sales marked as Paid reduce accounts receivable only if the receive method is \"Account Receviable\", but usually Paid sales with \"Cash\" means no impact on accounts receivable.\n   - Since \"Paid\" sales mostly have receive_method \"Cash\" here, they don't affect accounts receivable.\n   - Here, only Unpaid sales with receive_method \"Account Receviable\" increase accounts receivable.\n\n4. **Calculate the ending accounts receivable balance by summing all outstanding unpaid sales with receive_method \"Account Receviable\".**\n\n5. **Since no explicit collections/payments reducing accounts receivable are recorded, the change is basically the total of unpaid sales (accounts receivable at end) minus zero (initial).**\n\nLet's go through sales data with \"Account Receviable\" and \"Unpaid\":\n\n- Sale20240103002: 42,365.71 (Unpaid, AR)\n- Sale20240103003: 210,203.88 (Unpaid, AR)\n- Sale20240105007: 14,282.89\n- Sale20240105008: 57,947.08\n- Sale20240105009: 2,074.66\n- Sale20240106011: 2,971.81\n- Sale20240107013: 2,160.53\n- Sale20240107014: 43,879.89\n- Sale20240115020: 10,791.32\n- Sale20240115021: 41,521.81\n- Sale20240117024: 220,256.39\n- Sale20240117025: 59,992.23\n- Sale20240118028: 57,321.13\n- Sale20240121035: 232,916.62\n- Sale20240121036: 188,606.93\n- Sale20240123039: 48,078.98\n- Sale20240124041: 12,006.12\n- Sale20240128051: 40,096.08\n- Sale20240129053: 2,994.10\n- Sale20240129054: 13,434.22\n- Sale20240130055: 55,638.81\n- Sale20240131058: 13,921.69\n- Sale20240131059: 276,920.02\n- Sale20240202063: 195,343.26\n- Sale20240202064: 13,709.42\n- Sale20240202065: 10,969.01\n- Sale20240203066: 2,658.79\n- Sale20240203067: 2,842.50\n- Sale20240203068: 2,734.78\n- Sale20240126044: 52,600.07\n- Sale20240126045: 218,551.72\n- Sale20240123039: 48,078.98 (already counted)\n- Sale20240115008: 57947.08 (already counted)\n\n(Note: Please be careful not to double count.)\n\nSimilarly consider unpaid sales with \"Account Receviable\" **and no Payment/Receipt status \"Paid\"**.\n\nSum all those amounts:\n\nLet's sum all the unpaid sales with receive_method \"Account Receviable\":\n\nAdding:\n\n42365.71 + 210203.88 + 14282.89 + 57947.08 + 2074.66 + 2971.81 + 2160.53 + 43879.89 + 10791.32 + 41521.81 + 220256.39 + 59992.23 + 57321.13 + 232916.62 + 188606.93 + 48078.98 + 12006.12 + 40096.08 + 2994.1 + 13434.22 + 55638.81 (paid?
