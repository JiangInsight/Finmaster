equivalents balances**  \n- Initial Cash deposit = 3,000,000.0  \n- Initial Bank deposit = 5,000,000.0  \n=> Initial Cash and Cash Equivalents = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000.0  \n\nFixed Assets are not cash, so ignore the 5,000,000 fixed assets initial.\n\n**Step 2: Identify cash inflows (receipts) and outflows (payments) related to cash and cash equivalents**  \nWe consider only the transactions that affect cash and cash equivalents directly (i.e., those with payment_method = \"Cash\" or receive_method = \"Cash\"), including actual cash sales received (paid sales with receive_method=Cash), expenses paid in cash, purchases paid in cash, and any cash transfers that affect cash.\n\n**Step 3: Sum cash receipts**  \n- Sales paid with receive_method = Cash (Paid sales with \"Cash\") increase cash  \n- Interest income with payment_method = Cash (none shown as paid cash; all interests are \"Unpaid\")  \n- Any cash deposit (initial) already considered.\n\n**Step 4: Sum cash payments**  \n- Expenses paid by Cash lower cash position  \n- Purchases paid by Cash lower cash position  \n- Cash transfers between cash and bank do not affect total cash equivalents but reclassify between cash and bank, so net effect on total cash equivalents is zero.  \n- Ignore unpaid purchases or sales, or those paid by Bank Transfer or Account Payable, as they do not change cash immediately.\n\nLet's do detailed calculation by extracting relevant amounts:  \n\n---\n\n### From given data (focusing on payment_method or receive_method = Cash and payment/receipt_status =
