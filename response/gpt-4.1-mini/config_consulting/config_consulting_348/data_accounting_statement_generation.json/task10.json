Identify the initial value of fixed assets (non-current assets) at the beginning.\n2. Adjust for purchases (additions) of fixed assets during the period.\n3. Adjust for depreciation during the period (reduces asset value).\n4. There are no disposals or revaluations given, so just consider these.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial value of non-current assets\n\nFrom the initial records:\n\n- Fixed Assets on 2023-12-31 = 5,000,000.00\n\nThis is our starting point.\n\n### Step 2: Additions of fixed assets during the period\n\nLook for any transactions indicating fixed asset purchases during the period. Purchases of fixed assets or similar should be included.\n\nChecking the records, the only fixed asset purchase explicitly shown is:\n\n- There are no explicit fixed asset purchase transactions in the provided data beyond the initial 5,000,000.\n\n(Unlike the example dataset in the description, the problem data does not show any \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar lines.)\n\nSo, no additions have been recorded.\n\n### Step 3: Deduct depreciation during the period\n\nDepreciation entries are:\n\n- Depreciation20240101001 (2024-01-01): 45,756.35\n- Depreciation20240201002 (2024-02-01): 45,752.90\n\nTotal depreciation = 45,756.35 + 45,752.90 = 91,509.25\n\n### Step 4: Calculate final non-current assets value\n\nFinal non-current assets = Initial value + Additions - Depreciation\n\nAdditions = 0 (none found)\nDepreciation = 91,509.25\n\nFinal value = 5,000,000 - 91,509.25 = 4,908,490.75\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"4908490.75\"}}\n```\n",
