Identify Initial Inventory Value:\n   - Initial inventory refers to the value of inventory at the beginning of the period.\n   - In the problem data, the initial inventory values would be represented under \"Initial\" entries, specifically for inventory items.\n   - Initial balances for cash, bank, and fixed assets do not count as inventory.\n   - Since no initial inventory items are directly given, initial inventory is assumed 0 unless given explicitly.\n\n2. Calculate Purchases:\n   - Purchases add to inventory.\n   - Relevant purchases are those where product_id indicates inventory items.\n   - From the \"Purchase\" entries, extract the sum of purchases cost_amount or amount for products (exclude services).\n   - Products have product_id starting with \"S\" or \"S00X\" but these are service idsâ€”so only consider product_id that represent inventory.\n   - In this dataset, product_name like Consulting or Solution are services, so no inventory items are explicitly given. The data appears to be services and consulting types, not physical inventory.\n   \n3. Calculate Sales/Consumption:\n   - Sales reduce inventory.\n   - For sales of items considered inventory (product_ids which correspond to goods).\n   - Again, no clear inventory items are visible; most appear to be services.\n   - Thus, no sales of inventory reducing physical stock.\n\n4. Since the data appears to be all about services and consulting (S001, S002...), with no physical products, inventory is likely zero.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Inventory initial value = 0.00 (no initial inventory recorded)\n- Inventory end value = 0.00 (no purchases or sales of inventory items; services do not count as inventory)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Inventory End Value\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
