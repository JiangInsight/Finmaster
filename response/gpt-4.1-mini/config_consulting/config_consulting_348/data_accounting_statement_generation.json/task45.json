                        "content": "To calculate the net cash flow from investing activities, we typically consider cash transactions involving purchase and sale of long-term assets such as fixed assets, property, plant, and equipment, and investments.\n\nSteps:\n1. Identify cash transactions related to investing activities from the problem data:\n   - Look for purchases or sales of fixed assets or investments that were paid in cash or bank transfer (cash outflows).\n   - Look for disposal or sale of fixed assets or investments (cash inflows). However, from the problem data no explicit sales of fixed assets or investments are noted.\n\n2. In the given data, the following relevant transactions are found for investing activities:\n   - Initial Fixed Assets value at 2023-12-31: 5,000,000 (this is opening balance, not cash flow)\n   - Purchase transactions related to assets or investments (large amounts usually):\n     - Purchase20231231003: 3000.0 Paid by Bank Transfer (seems consulting related, treat as operating)\n     - Purchase20231231004: 5000.0 Paid by Bank Transfer (consulting - operating)\n     - Purchase20231231008: 300000.0 Paid Bank Transfer S010 Supplier 10 for S004 Enterprise Solution (could be investment or asset)\n     - Purchase20231231013: 200000.0 Paid Bank Transfer S006 Supplier 6 for S004 Enterprise Solution (seems asset/investment)\n     - Purchase20231231019: 60000.0 Paid Cash - consulting related (likely operating)\n     - Purchase20231231023: 60000.0 Paid Bank Transfer S003 Premium Consulting (operating)\n   - However, there is no explicit mention of \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar in this problem, unlike in the example where there was a fixed asset purchase entry \"FixedAsset20231231001\" with amount 305354.43 which was the cash outflow from investing activities.\n\n3. The problem does not list any transactions explicitly tagged as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or sales of assets. It lists only purchases of services or solutions (consulting etc), which are operating activities, not investing.\n\n4. From the problem data, there is no transaction explicitly categorized as an investing activity (like purchase or sale of fixed assets or investments).\n\n5. Thus, based on given data, net cash flow from investing activities = 0.0 since no cash outflow or inflow related to asset purchase or disposal is explicitly recorded.\n\nTherefore,\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0.0\"}}\n```\n\n# Summary:\n- No explicit fixed asset or investment transaction cash flow recorded.\n- Purchases are mainly consulting or operational.\n- Hence, net cash flow from investing activities is zero.",
