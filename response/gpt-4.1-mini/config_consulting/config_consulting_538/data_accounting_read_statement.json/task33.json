Identify the \"income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities\":\n   - Typically, this corresponds to revenues generated from primary business activities.\n   - From the statement, \"Main Business Revenue\" is the core operating income.\n   - Its value is 3025437.82.\n\n2. Identify the \"carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period\":\n   - This is generally reflected by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS), representing the cost related to inventory sold.\n   - The value here is 1312000.00.\n\n3. Maintain the original line item order from the input statement:\n   - \"Main Business Revenue\" first, then \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n\nHence:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3025437.82', 'value2': '1312000.00'} }\n```",
