Looking into the income statement:\n   - \"Cost of Goods Sold\": 1,312,000.00 (This relates to production or purchase cost, not directly to securing orders or delivery.)\n   - \"Administrative Expenses\": 126,790.73 (Relates to administration, not directly customer order securing/delivery)\n   - \"Selling Expenses\": 345,311.74 (This generally represents costs to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services)\n   - Other expenses like Depreciation, Financial Expenses, etc., are unrelated to this task.\n\n2. Therefore, the relevant item is \"Selling Expenses\" with the amount 345,311.74.\n\nHence, the value for costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services is 345,311.74.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"345311.74\"}}\n```",
