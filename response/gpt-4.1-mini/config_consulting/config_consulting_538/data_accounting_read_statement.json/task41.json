Look for a line item related to changes in tax accrued but not yet paid.\n2. In the given data, the relevant line is \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\".\n3. The amount associated with this line is 151271.87.\n4. Since the amount is positive, it indicates an increase in tax payable (tax accrued but not yet paid).\n\nHence, the value to extract is 151271.87.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"151271.87\"}}\n```",
