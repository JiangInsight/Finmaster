The three specific line items requested are:\n   - Total income arising from ordinary activities: This corresponds to \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue.\" Both have the same value, but we maintain the original line order, so we take the first occurrence, which is \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n   - Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period: This is typically \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n   - Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole: This usually corresponds to \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n\n2. From the input:\n   - \"Main Business Revenue\" = 3025437.82\n   - \"Cost of Goods Sold\" = 1312000.00\n   - \"Administrative Expenses\" = 126790.73\n\n3. The order in the input statement is:\n   - Main Business Revenue (value1)\n   - Cost of Goods Sold (value2)\n   - Administrative Expenses (value3)\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3025437.82', 'value2': '1312000.00', 'value3': '126790.73'}}\n```",
