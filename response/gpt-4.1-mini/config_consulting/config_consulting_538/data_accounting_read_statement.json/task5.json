Such assets are typically represented by the \"Inventory\" line item.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n- Assets held for sale or in production for sale are typically included in \"Inventory\".\n- From the problem data, the \"Inventory\" values are:\n  - Initial (2023-12-31): 0.00\n  - End (2024-02-05): 174000.00\n- No other line items explicitly represent assets held for sale.\n\nTherefore, the initial value of such assets is 0.00 and the end value is 174000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"174000.00\"}}\n```",
