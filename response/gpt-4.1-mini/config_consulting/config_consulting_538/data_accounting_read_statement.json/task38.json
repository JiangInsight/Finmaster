This corresponds to changes in accounts receivable (amounts owed to the entity).\n\nLooking at the problem data:\n\n| Account                             | Amount      | Date       |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------|------------|\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable | -1716911.17 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThis line item corresponds to the change in amounts owed to the entity. Here, a negative value indicates an increase in accounts receivable (more amounts owed, which is a use of cash), and a positive value would indicate a decrease in amounts owed (collection of receivables).\n\nSince the task is to identify the decrease in amounts owed during the period, we normally look for positive values for the change in accounts receivable -- meaning that receivables decreased.\n\nHowever, the value given is -1716911.17, which means accounts receivable increased by 1,716,911.17 (a use of cash). So there is no decrease here in the accounts receivable.\n\nNevertheless, the task says \"identify and extract the specific line items and value of decrease in amounts owed...\"\n\nIn the given example, the line item to extract is the (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable line. Despite the value being negative (meaning an increase), this is the line item that reflects changes in amounts owed to the entity.\n\nTherefore, we return the value of this line item as it is, since it clearly represents the change in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit.\n\nHence:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-1716911.17\"}}\n```\n\n# Final answer:  \n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-1716911.17\"}}\n```",
