Depreciation is typically presented in the Income Statement as an expense.\n2. It is also reflected in the Balance Sheet under \"Accumulated Depreciation.\"\n3. It should appear in the Cash Flow statement under operating activities as \"Depreciation\" since depreciation is a non-cash expense added back in calculating operating cash flow.\n4. In the given financial statements, the relevant depreciation values are:\n   - Balance Sheet: Accumulated Depreciation = 91,503.06 (Ending amount)\n   - Cash Flow: Depreciation = 91,503.06\n   - Income Statement: Depreciation expense = 91,503.06\n5. These values are consistent, indicating the depreciation expense for the period is 91,503.06.\n\nTherefore, the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount (depreciation expense) is 91,503.06.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"91503.06\"}}\n```",
