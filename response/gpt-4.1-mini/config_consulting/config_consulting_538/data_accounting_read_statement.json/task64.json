                        "content": "Step 1: Identify the three required line items:\n\n- From **Balance Sheet**: \"capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares\"  \n  This corresponds to **Paid-in Capital**.\n\n- From **Income Statement**: \"end value of profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense\"  \n  This corresponds to **Profit Before Tax**.\n\n- From **Balance Sheet** or **Cash Flow Statement**: \"addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period\"  \n  This corresponds to **Accounts Payable** (increase in liabilities).\n\nStep 2: Extract the corresponding end values from the input:\n\n- Balance Sheet:  \n  Paid-in Capital = 13000000.00\n\n- Income Statement:  \n  Profit Before Tax = 1114535.06\n\n- Balance Sheet:  \n  Accounts Payable = 816000.00\n\nStep 3: Format the extracted values as per instructions (grouped by financial statement order):\n\n1. Balance Sheet (Paid-in Capital, Accounts Payable)  \n   - Paid-in Capital: 13000000.00  \n   - Accounts Payable: 816000.00\n\n2. Income Statement (Profit Before Tax)  \n   - Profit Before Tax: 1114535.06\n\nAccording to the instructions:  \n- For multiple outputs, group them by financial statement order:  \n  1. Balance Sheet  \n  2. Income Statement  \n  3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n- Within each group, maintain the original line item order as shown in the input financial statement.\n\nSo the three values are:\n\n- value1: capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares (Paid-in Capital) from Balance Sheet  \n- value2: profit or loss before tax (Profit Before Tax) from Income Statement  \n- value3: addition in amount owed for goods or services (Accounts Payable) from Balance Sheet\n\nNote: Although Accounts Payable is from Balance Sheet, it is only one value for that group, so we keep the order given: first Paid-in Capital then Accounts Payable. But problem instruction says for multiple outputs, group by financial statement order (Balance Sheet first), and within each group keep the item order as in input.\n\nHere we have two relevant line items in Balance Sheet (Paid-in Capital and Accounts Payable). The problem example only outputs three values, so must carefully assign values to value1, value2, and value3 in order:\n\nThe example answer showed that for value1 it's the capital contributed by shareholders (Paid-in Capital), for value2 it's profit before tax, for value3 it's accounts payable (addition in amount owed).\n\nHence use:\n\n- value1: Paid-in Capital (Balance Sheet)  \n- value2: Profit Before Tax (Income Statement)  \n- value3: Accounts Payable (Balance Sheet)\n\nFinal answer:  \n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"13000000.00\", \"value2\": \"1114535.06\", \"value3\": \"816000.00\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Final output:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"13000000.00\", \"value2\": \"1114535.06\", \"value3\": \"816000.00\"}}\n```",
