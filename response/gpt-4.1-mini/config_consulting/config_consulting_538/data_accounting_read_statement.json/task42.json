Look at the section \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" because purchases of fixed assets (property, plant, and equipment) are typically reported there.\n2. The line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" shows the value of such payments.\n3. From the data, \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is listed with the amount 0.00.\n\nTherefore, the value of cash payments for acquiring property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets is 0.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
