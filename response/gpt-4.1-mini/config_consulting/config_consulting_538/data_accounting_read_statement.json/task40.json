The task is to find the specific line item that shows the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.  \n2. This corresponds to \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" in a cash flow statement, because Accounts Payable represents the amount owed to suppliers or vendors for goods or services received on credit.  \n3. From the given data, the line \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" has the value 816000.00 on 2024-02-05.\n\nThus, the value of the increase in amounts owed (Accounts Payable) is '816000.00'.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '816000.00'} }\n```",
