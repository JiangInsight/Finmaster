The inventory line from the balance sheet shows the ending amount as 174,000.00 and initial as 0.00 but this only reflects the ending inventory, not the sold amount.\n2. The inventory change in cash flow is (Increase) Decrease in Inventory = -174,000.00, indicating inventory increased by 174,000, but that does not directly give us sold amount.\n3. The income statement indicates Cost of Goods Sold = 1,312,000.00, which is the carrying amount of inventories sold during the period.\n\nTherefore, the value of carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is 1,312,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"1312000.00\"}}\n```",
