                        "content": "First, let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. We need to identify the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities related to:\n   - Acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments (not included in cash equivalents).\n   - Receipt of interest and dividends.\n\n2. These typically appear in the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section.\n\n3. We are to provide:\n   - The net value of cash and cash equivalents generated from these investing activities.\n   - At least one component sub-item from the cash flow statement related to this calculation, and its value.\n\n---\n\nReviewing the input data:\n\n- From the Cash Flow From Investing Activities section:\n  - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 0.00\n  - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -0.00\n\nThere are no other investing line items shown. \n\n\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is part of acquisition of long-term assets, which is relevant.\n\nNo mention of \"disposal of fixed assets\" or \"receipt of interest and dividends\".\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from investing activities = Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -0.00\n\n- The only sub-item to select is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with amount 0.00.\n\n---\n\nConstructing the output JSON as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items_Purchase of Fixed Assets': '0.00'}}\n```\n\n---\n\nNote on formatting:\n\n- The problem examples used keys like 'sub_items' and sometimes with suffixes representing sub-item names.\n\n- The instruction says: For each sub-item, output its final value.\n\n- So I will write the key as 'sub_items_Purchase of Fixed Assets' with a value of \"0.00\".\n\n---\n\n# Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-0.00\", \"sub_items_Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
