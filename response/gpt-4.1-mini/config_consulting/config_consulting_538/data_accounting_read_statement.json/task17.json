The line item that represents amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit is typically **\"Accounts Receivable\"**.\n\n2. The line item that represents amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit is typically **\"Accounts Payable\"**.\n\n3. Extract the initial and end amounts for these two line items from the given balance sheet:\n\n- Accounts Receivable: Initial_amount = 0.00, End_amount = 1,716,911.17\n- Accounts Payable: Initial_amount = 0.00, End_amount = 816,000.00\n\n4. Maintain the order as shown in the input (Accounts Receivable first, then Accounts Payable).\n\nHence, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '0.00', 'end valu1': '1716911.17', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '816000.00'}}\n```",
