Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 116,257.19\n\n### 2. Total Debt\nFrom the balance sheet at the end date 2024-02-05:\n\n- Total Current Liabilities = 967,271.87\n- Non-current liabilities are not explicitly listed here, thus assumed 0 or none provided.\n- Therefore, Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 967,271.87\n\n### Calculation:\n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = 116,257.19 / 967,271.87 â‰ˆ 0.1202\n\nRounded to 2 decimal places = 0.12\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"0.12\"}}\n```",
