Here, purchase transactions related to fixed assets might be those with significant amounts or purchases of asset-like products. However, since the problem statement does not specify which purchases are fixed assets, and there is no \"asset_name\" or \"asset_type\" attached, we will consider that fixed asset purchases are not explicitly given, so we assume only depreciation affects the net value.  \n- Depreciation: It lowers the net value of fixed assets. Depreciation amounts are listed under type starting with \"Depreciation\".\n\n**Step 3: Calculate depreciation total**  \nFrom the problem data, depreciation entries before 2024-02-05 are:  \n- 2024-01-01: 45752.22  \n- 2024-02-01: 45750.84  \n\nSumming up depreciation:  \n45752.22 + 45750.84 = 91503.06\n\n**Step 4: Calculate net value of fixed assets at period end**  \nAssuming no purchases or disposals specifically of fixed assets other than depreciation:  \nFixed Assets Net End Value = Initial Fixed Assets - Total Depreciation  \n= 5,000,000.00 - 91,503.06 = 4,908,496.94\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'fixed assets net Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'fixed assets net End Value': '4908496.94'} }\n```",
