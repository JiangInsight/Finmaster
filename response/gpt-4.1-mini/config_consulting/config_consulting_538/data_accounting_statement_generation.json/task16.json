                        "content": "To find the \"Paid-in Capital\" initial and end values from the given transactions, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial \"Paid-in Capital\" value from the transactions dated at the initial date (2023-12-31).\n2. Since none of the transactions seem to show additional capital injections or withdrawals after the initial date, and only operating transactions (sales, purchases, expenses) occur afterward, the \"Paid-in Capital\" should remain unchanged.\n3. Verify there are no capital-related transactions after the initial date. We look for entries with \"Initial\" type or mention \"Capital injection\" or similar, but none appear beyond 2023-12-31.\n4. The initial \"Paid-in Capital\" can be summed from initial deposits that represent capital (commonly cash and bank deposits and fixed assets at initial date):\n   - Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n   - Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n   - Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.0\n   Total = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.0\n\n5. No changes occur to paid-in capital later, so the end value remains the same.\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"13000000.00\"}}\n```",
