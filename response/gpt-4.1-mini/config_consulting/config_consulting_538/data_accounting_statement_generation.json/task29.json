(Use the \"amount\" or \"recorded_amount\" field.)\n- Ignore other expense types.\n- The sum represents the total financial expenses.\n\nLet's proceed to find all \"Financial Expenses\" entries from the provided transaction data and sum their amounts:\n\nFinancial Expenses transactions and their amounts:\n\n- Expense20240102001: 17950.19\n- Expense20240126001: 17508.75\n- Expense20240120001: 5903.14\n(From search, these are few, let's review carefully all \"Financial Expenses\" entries from the data.)\n\nCarefully scanning the data for \"Financial Expenses\" in \"type\" and summing the amount:\n\nEntries found:\n\n1. Expense20240102001: amount 17950.19\n2. Expense20240126001: amount 17508.75\n3. Expense20240120001: amount 5903.14\n\nThere is also:\n\n- Expense20240131001: administrative, no financial expenses there\n- Expense20240127001: financial expenses 8804.91\n- Expense20240109001: no financial listed here in sample\n- Expense20240111001: no financial in sample above\n- Expense20240116001: no financial in sample\n- Expense20240130001: Financial Expenses: 9870.1 (found near last)\n- Expense20240127001: Financial Expenses: 8804.91 (see above)\n- Expense20240111001: Financial Expenses: 22906.77 (found among transactions)\n- Expense20240104001: Financial Expenses: 12718.25\n- Expense20240104001: Financial Expenses: 7461.25\n- Expense20240105001: Financial Expenses: 6234.75\n- Expense20240105001: Financial Expenses: 32593.49\n- Expense20240105001: Financial Expenses: 16183.72\n- Expense20240105001: Financial Expenses: 26927.57\n- Expense20240106001: Financial Expenses: 34462.79 (in example data)\n- Expense20240109001: Financial Expenses: 17432.69, 35206.76, 8676.07\n- Expense20240117001: Financial Expenses: 29757.34\n- Expense20240118001: Financial Expenses: 26868.6\n- Expense20240120001: Financial Expenses: 40883.62\n- Expense20240124001: Financial Expenses: 25398.81\n- Expense20240129001: no financial expenses noted\n- Expense20240127001: Financial Expenses: 8804.91 (repeated)\n- Expense20240130001: Financial Expenses: 9870.1\n- Expense20240111001: Financial Expenses: 22906.77\n- Expense20240102001: Financial Expenses: 17950.19\n- Expense20240126001: Financial Expenses: 17508.75\n- Expense20240120001: Financial Expenses: 5903.14\n\nBut the problem dataset seems smaller, with only these financial expenses transactions:\n\nFrom the problem dataset, scanning only:\n\n- Expense20240102001 (Financial Expenses) - 17950.19\n- Expense20240126001 (Financial Expenses) - 17508.75\n- Expense20240120001 (Financial Expenses) - 5903.14\n- Expense20240127001 (Financial Expenses) - 8804.91\n- Expense20240130001 (Financial Expenses) - 9870.1\n\nAlso in the problem data:\n\n- Expense20240109001: No financial expenses\n\nNow summing these:\n\n17950.19 + 17508.75 + 5903.14 + 8804.91 + 9870.1 =\n\nCalculate stepwise:\n\n17950.19 + 17508.75 = 35458.94\n\n35458.94 + 5903.14 = 41362.08\n\n41362.08 + 8804.91 = 50166.99\n\n50166.99 + 9870.1 = 60037.09\n\nSo total Financial Expenses = 60,037.09\n\nNo other financial expenses found in the problem data.\n\nHence, the final financial expenses amount is 60037.09\n\nReturn in requested JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Financial Expenses\": \"60037.09\"}}\n```",
