Since no inventory or other current assets originally, we deduce cash + bank balances by:\n\n  Initial cash & bank = 8,000,000.00\n\n  Adjusted for:\n\n  - Cash/Bank paid for purchases and expenses\n  - Cash/Bank received from sales (paid sales)\n  - Transfers between cash and bank (no net effect)\n  - Unpaid purchase or sale (do not affect cash but affect receivable/payable)\n\n- **Accounts receivable** (unpaid sales amounts): Sum the amount for all sales with payment/receipt_status 'Unpaid' (or with \"Account Receviable\" payment method).
