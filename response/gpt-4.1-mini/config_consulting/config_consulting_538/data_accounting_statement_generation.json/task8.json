In this data, initial accumulated depreciation is not stated (assumed 0), then the depreciation expenses are the amounts added.\n\nSince the task asks for initial and final amounts of accumulated depreciation (which is usually a cumulative sum of depreciation expense):\n\n- Initial accumulated depreciation: 0.00  \n- Depreciation during period sum: 45752.22 + 45750.84 = 91503.06  \n- Final accumulated depreciation = initial + depreciation during period = 0 + 91503.06 = 91503.06\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"91503.06\"}}\n```",
