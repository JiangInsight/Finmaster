None are accounts receivable, so initial AR = 0.00.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate final accounts receivable amount at the balance date end**  \n- Accounts receivable arise mainly from sales that are unpaid or recorded as receivables.\n- We look for \"Sale\" entries with payment/receipt_status: \"Unpaid\" or any line with \"Account Receviable\" (even if paid later, only unpaid amounts contribute to AR balance).\n- Sum the **amount** or the relevant money indicating outstanding receivable.\n\n**Details**\n\nFrom problem data:\n\n- Initial AR value = 0.00\n\n- We sum all \"Sale\" rows where payment/receipt_status == \"Unpaid\" and receive_method == \"Account Receviable\".  \n  Because these correspond to invoices outstanding at balance date.\n\nCheck rows:\n\n- Sale20240102001 (2024-01-02): amount 187276.53, status Unpaid, receive_method Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240102002 (2024-01-02): amount 38382.28, status Unpaid, receive_method Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240103003 (2024-01-03): amount 49544.93, Unpaid, Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240103004 (2024-01-03): amount 42123.04, Unpaid, Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240106009 (2024-01-06): amount 13508.51, Unpaid, Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240106010 (2024-01-06): amount 13808.73, Unpaid, Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240111022 (2024-01-11): amount 46958.27, Unpaid, Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240111023 (2024-01-11): amount 256579.57, Unpaid, Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240112025 (2024-01-12): amount 12805.9, Unpaid, Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240112026 (2024-01-12): amount 39275.99, Unpaid, Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240113030 (2024-01-13): amount 2751.44, Unpaid, Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240113031 (2024-01-13): amount 9553.3, Unpaid, Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240114033 (2024-01-14): Paid (skip), Sale20240114023 (not in data)  \n- Sale20240115034 (2024-01-15): amount 2447.22, Unpaid, Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240115035 (2024-01-15): amount 10343.58, Unpaid, Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240115036 (2024-01-15): amount 250134.77, Unpaid, Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240116039 (2024-01-16): amount 2896.29, Unpaid, Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240116040 (2024-01-16): amount 230916.68, Unpaid, Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240117043 (2024-01-17): amount 13668.24, Unpaid, Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240117044 (2024-01-17): amount 2365.03, Unpaid, Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240118046 (2024-01-18): Paid (skip)  \n- Sale20240118030 missing from problem data?
