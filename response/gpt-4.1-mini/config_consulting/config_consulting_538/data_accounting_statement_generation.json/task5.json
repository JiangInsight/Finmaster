But we should be summing all *unpaid* interest amounts net of any payment and adjustments.\n\nIn the data, the first day interest receivable on 2024-01-01 is 430.76, which is unpaid.\n\nBy 2024-02-05, total Interest Receivable accounts many similar values.\n\nBut is the question asking to sum all these interest amounts, or is the interest receivable the unpaid balance notebook - that is, accumulate all unpaid Interest Receivable amounts?\n\nSince task is based on \"transactions data\", and the interest receivables are recorded daily as transaction entries, and all are unpaid entries of interest receivable.\n\nBut importantly, in the problem data there are no payments of interest receivables shown (no \"Paid\" status on Interest Receivable entries). So the interest receivable at end is sum of all Interest Receivable transaction amounts.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Initial Interest Receivable at 2023-12-31 = 0.00 (no entries before 2024-01-01)\n\n- Sum all Interest Receivables between 2024-01-01 and last date in data (2024-02-05).\n\nSum of all given Interest Receivables entries approximately = 430.76 + 430.76 + 429.425 + 420.525 + 420.525 + 420.525 + 416.52 + 416.52 + 416.52 + 412.07 + 412.07 + 412.07 + 412.07 + 411.803 + 411.803 + 411.803 + 411.803 + 411.803 + 411.803 + 411.536 + 411.536 + 411.536 + 411.536 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.976 + 407.709 + 407.709 + 407.709 + 407.531 â‰ˆ 14461.79\n\nEach daily amount values are very consistent and close to ~ 410-430.\n\nNow the problem is that the interest receivable entries have duplicated entries per day (multiple entries with the same date). In the problem, no clear indication which entries to sum once or multiple times.\n\nLooking into the problem data, the interest receivables entries with the same date occur just once or multiple times?\n\nFrom the sample:\n\n- On 2024-01-01: 430.76 (one entry)\n\n- On 2024-01-02: 430.76 (one entry)\n\n- On 2024-02-05: 407.531 (one entry)\n\nFrom the data, each Interest Receivable entry corresponds to one record with amount, so we sum all values.\n\nTherefore, after summing all the 'Interest Receivables' amounts, the total is approximately 14,461.79.\n\nBut in the example solution box shown in task, only about 2,672.87 was the end value. So this suggests the interest receivables in that example were smaller, or only some interest receivable amounts are to be counted.\n\nLikely the problem wants us to sum up all Interest Receivable amounts in the transaction list, i.e., sum all interest receivable entries amounts (some are negative, but in our problem all are positive).\n\nIn the current problem, all Interest Receivables entries have value of about 410 to 430, with multiple entries?\n\nNo, the data shows many entries of 'Interest Receivables' with 411-ish amounts, but upon looking carefully, in the provided problem, the interest entries are almost all the same amount repeated many times, suggesting these are separate interest accruals for multiple different receivables (or perhaps duplicates).\n\nGiven that, let's count the number of Interest Receivable entries in the problem data:\n\nLooking for lines starting with \"Interest*\".\n\nCounting in problem data:\n\n- Interest20240101001: 430.76\n\n- Interest20240102002: 430.76\n\n- Interest20240103003: 429.42499999999995\n\n- Interest20240104004: 420.525\n\n- Interest20240105005: 420.525\n\n- Interest20240106006: 420.525\n\n- Interest20240107007: 416.52\n\n- Interest20240108008: 416.52\n\n- Interest20240109009: 416.52\n\n- Interest20240110010: 412.07\n\n- Interest20240111011: 412.07\n\n- Interest20240112012: 412.07\n\n- Interest20240113013: 412.07\n\n- Interest20240114014: 411.803\n\n- Interest20240115015: 411.803\n\n- Interest20240116016: 411.803\n\n- Interest20240117017: 411.803\n\n- Interest20240118018: 411.803\n\n- Interest20240119019: 411.803\n\n- Interest20240120020: 411.536\n\n- Interest20240121021: 411.536\n\n- Interest20240122022: 411.536\n\n- Interest20240123023: 411.536\n\n- Interest20240124024: 407.976\n\n- Interest20240125025: 407.976\n\n- Interest20240126026: 407.976\n\n- Interest20240127027: 407.976\n\n- Interest20240128028: 407.976\n\n- Interest20240129029: 407.976\n\n- Interest20240130030: 407.976\n\n- Interest20240131031: 407.976\n\n- Interest20240201032: 407.976\n\n- Interest20240202033: 407.709\n\n- Interest20240203034: 407.709\n\n- Interest20240204035: 407.709\n\n- Interest20240205036: 407.53099999999995\n\nCount = 36 entries\n\nNow summing with exact amounts:\n\nSum =  \n(430.76 + 430.76 + 429.425 + 420.525*3 + 416.52*3 + 412.07*4 + 411.803*6 + 411.536*4 + 407.976*8 + 407.709*3 + 407.531)\n\nCalculations:\n\n- 430.76 + 430.76 = 861.52\n\n- 861.52 + 429.425 = 1290.945\n\n- 420.525*3=1261.575; 1290.945+1261.575=2552.52\n\n- 416.52*3=1249.56; 2552.52+1249.56=3802.08\n\n- 412.07*4=1648.28; 3802.08+1648.28=5450.36\n\n- 411.803*6=2470.818; 5450.36+2470.818=7921.178\n\n- 411.536*4=1646.144; 7921.178+1646.144=9567.322\n\n- 407.976*8=3263.808; 9567.322+3263.808=12831.13\n\n- 407.709*3=1223.127; 12831.13+1223.127=14054.26\n\n- 407.531 (last one): 14054.26 + 407.531 = 14461.79 approximately\n\nHence,\n\nInterest Receivable End Value = 14,461.79\n\nBut such a large amount probably represents the total interest accrued over the period and unpaid.\n\nYet in the example, the interest receivable end value was 2672.87 for fewer entries.\n\nSince the task doesn't give a cutoff date for balance sheet or an initial interest amount, and all interest receivables are Unpaid, the total balance sheet interest receivable is sum of all interest receivable amounts posted so far.\n\nAlso, since no Interest Receivable recorded on or before 2023-12-31, initial is zero.\n\nFinal:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Interest Receivable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Interest Receivable End Value': '14461.79'}}\n\n# Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"14461.79\"}}\n```",
