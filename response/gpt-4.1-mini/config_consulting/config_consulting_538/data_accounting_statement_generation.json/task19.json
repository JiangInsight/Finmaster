expenses reduce equity.\n\nExpenses during the period paid (expenses reduce owner's equity):\n\n- Expense20240101001: 11,406.69\n- Expense20240102001: 2,296.4 + 17,950.19 = 20,246.59\n- Expense20240103001: 15,779.23\n- Expense20240104001: 4,102.96 + 3,093.29 = 7,196.25\n- Expense20240105001: 4,123.93\n- Expense20240107001: 8,026.41 + 14,216.99 = 22,243.4\n- Expense20240108001: 12,770.5\n- Expense20240109001: 11,640.26 + 2,017.12 = 13,657.38\n- Expense20240110001: 11,778.13\n- Expense20240111001: 4,325.6\n- Expense20240112001: 10,465.92 + 2,948.88 = 13,414.8\n- Expense20240114001: 3,735.72\n- Expense20240115001: 13,673.38 + 16,231.75 = 29,905.13\n- Expense20240116001: 17,491.65 + 15,573.97 = 33,065.62\n- Expense20240117001: 16,409.05 + 16,585.16 = 32,994.21\n- Expense20240118001: 7,152.4\n- Expense20240119001: 13,588.7 + 2,942.5 = 16,531.2\n- Expense20240120001: 3,054.48 + 5,903.14 = 8,957.62\n- Expense20240121001: 3,346.81 + 7,433.08 = 10,779.89\n- Expense20240122001: 5,765.02\n- Expense20240125001: 5,517.94 + 2,221.08 = 7,739.02\n- Expense20240126001: 17,508.75 + 15,371.78 = 32,880.53\n- Expense20240130001: 14,803.98 + 5,320.13 = 20,124.11\n\nSum of expenses (approx):\n\nAdd all:\n\n11,406.69 +\n20,246.59 = 31,653.28 +\n15,779.23 = 47,432.51 +\n7,196.25 = 54,628.76 +\n4,123.93 = 58,752.69 +\n22,243.4 = 80,996.09 +\n12,770.5 = 93,766.59 +\n13,657.38 = 107,423.97 +\n11,778.13 = 119,202.10 +\n4,325.6 = 123,527.7 +\n13,414.8 = 136,942.5 +\n3,735.72 = 140,678.22 +\n29,905.13 = 170,583.35 +\n33,065.62 = 203,648.97 +\n32,994.21 = 236,643.18 +\n7,152.4 = 243,795.58 +\n16,531.2 = 260,326.78 +\n8,957.62 = 269,284.4 +\n10,779.89 = 280,064.29 +\n5,765.02 = 285,829.31 +\n7,739.02 = 293,568.33 +\n32,880.53 = 326,448.86 +\n20,124.11 = 346,572.97\n\nTotal expenses (reduce owner's equity): approx 346,573\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Sales and Profit (Increase Owner's Equity)\n\nSales amounts add to assets and profits increase owner's equity.\n\nWe consider total profit by summing all 'profit' entries in sales.\n\nSum sales profit:\n\nFrom all sales (some sample profits):\n\n- 87,276.53\n- 18,382.28\n- 29,544.93\n- 22,123.04\n- 59,30.08 (from one sale)\n- 8,508.51\n- 8,808.73\n- 34,853.57\n- 77,770.14\n- Many others with listed 'profit' values.\n\nWe should sum all sales 'profit' values present.\n\nFrom the data entries (focusing on 'profit' column available):\n\nAggregate sales profit values from the provided entries:\n\n- 87,276.53\n- 18,382.28\n- 29,544.93\n- 22,123.04\n- 5,930.08\n- 8,508.51\n- 8,808.73\n- 34,853.57\n- 99,566.18\n- 9,979.31 (could be tax_amount;
