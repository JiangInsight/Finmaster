The total accounts payable balance at the end.\n3. The net change is (Ending Accounts Payable) - (Beginning Accounts Payable).\n\nSince the initial balances are given on 2023-12-31 and transactions extend into 2024, the relevant accounts payable balances correspond to the sums of unpaid purchases at the end date.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify all purchases with their payment status and amounts\n\n- Only purchases with **payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\"** contribute to accounts payable balances.\n- Purchases with \"Paid\" are not part of accounts payable (already paid).\n- We need to sum the amounts for purchases that are \"Unpaid.\"\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Extract initial accounts payable balances as of 2023-12-31\n\nLook for any \"Initial\" or opening balance related to accounts payable. In this dataset, the initial balance is embedded in:\n\n- No explicit opening accounts payable line stated; so the **initial accounts payable is zero** (or assume zero if none is given).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Sum all **unpaid purchases** (accounts payable at the end)\n\nFrom the dataset, pick all purchase entries where:\n\n- type = \"Purchase\",\n- payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\",\n- Sum their \"amount\" values.\n\nLet's list all unpaid purchases with their amounts (extracting from given data):\n\n1. Purchase20231231006: Paid -> ignore.\n2. Purchase20231231013: Unpaid, amount=1000.0\n3. Purchase20231231014: Unpaid, amount=15000.0\n4. Purchase20231231015: Paid -> ignore.\n5. Purchase20231231018: Unpaid, amount=60000.0\n6. Purchase20231231020: Paid -> ignore.\n7. Purchase20231231023: Paid -> ignore.\n8. Purchase20231231024: Unpaid, amount=20000.0\n9. Purchase20231231025: Unpaid, amount=5000.0\n10. Purchase20231231026: Unpaid, amount=300000.0\n11. Purchase20231231029: Unpaid, amount=15000.0\n\nWe also need to verify if these entries match payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\" and count only those.\n\nCross-checking from problem:\n\n- Purchase20231231013: Unpaid, 1000.0\n- Purchase20231231014: Unpaid, 15000.0\n- Purchase20231231018: Unpaid, 60000.0\n- Purchase20231231024: Unpaid, 20000.0\n- Purchase20231231025: Unpaid, 5000.0\n- Purchase20231231026: Unpaid, 300000.0\n- Purchase20231231029: Unpaid, 15000.0\n- Purchase20231231030: Paid, ignore\n- Purchase20231231010 (mentioned): Unpaid, amount=300000.0 (Yes, Purchase20231231010 is mentioned as unpaid above with amount 300000.0)\n- Purchase20231231006: Paid, ignore.\n\nDouble-check missing ones:\n\n- Purchase20231231010: Unpaid, amount=300000.0\n- Purchase20231231029: Unpaid, amount=15000.0\n- Purchase20231231015: Paid, ignore\n- Purchase20231231003: Paid, ignore\n- Purchase20231231004: Paid, ignore\n- Purchase20231231005: Paid, ignore\n- Purchase20231231007: Paid, ignore\n- Purchase20231231008: Paid, ignore\n- Purchase20231231009: Paid, ignore\n- Purchase20231231011: Paid, ignore\n- Purchase20231231012: Paid, ignore\n- Purchase20231231016: Paid, ignore\n- Purchase20231231017: Paid, ignore\n- Purchase20231231019: Paid, ignore\n- Purchase20231231021: Paid, ignore\n- Purchase20231231022: Paid, ignore\n- Purchase20231231027: Paid, ignore\n- Purchase20231231028: Paid, ignore\n\nSumming just the unpaid purchases amounts:\n\n- 1000.0 (P13)\n- 15000.0 (P14)\n- 60000.0 (P18)\n- 20000.0 (P24)\n- 5000.0 (P25)\n- 300000.0 (P26)\n- 15000.0 (P29)\n- 300000.0 (P10)  â†’ This was missed initially, add this too\n\nTotal unpaid purchases = 1000 + 15000 + 60000 + 20000 + 5000 + 300000 + 15000 + 300000  \n= 1000 + 15000 = 16000  \n16000 + 60000 = 76000  \n76000 + 20000 = 96000  \n96000 + 5000 = 101000  \n101000 + 300000 = 401000  \n401000 + 15000 = 416000  \n416000 + 300000 = 716000  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Sum all **paid purchases** (to confirm no double counting or initial balance)\n\nThese are not part of accounts payable as they are already paid, but check if any to consider for beginning balance:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: Paid 100000.0\n- Purchase20231231002: Paid 60000.0\n- Purchase20231231003: Paid 15000.0\n- Purchase20231231004: Paid 100000.0\n- Purchase20231231005: Paid 100000.0\n- Purchase20231231006: Paid 1150000.0\n- Purchase20231231007: Paid 2400000.0\n- Purchase20231231008: Paid 40000.0\n- Purchase20231231009: Paid 15000.0\n- Purchase20231231011: Paid 10000.0\n- Purchase20231231012: Paid 40000.0\n- Purchase20231231015: Paid 3000.0\n- Purchase20231231016: Paid 2000.0\n- Purchase20231231017: Paid 40000.0\n- Purchase20231231019: Paid 2000.0\n- Purchase20231231021: Paid 40000.0\n- Purchase20231231022: Paid 10000.0\n- Purchase20231231023: Paid 40000.0\n- Purchase20231231027: Paid 3000.0\n- Purchase20231231028: Paid 3000.0\n\nSum of paid purchases is not needed for accounts payable calculation except to confirm no overlap.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Find net change in accounts payable\n\nSince no opening accounts payable initial balance supplied (assumed zero), the ending accounts payable equals the sum of unpaid purchases.\n\nSo, **Increase in accounts payable = 716,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer in required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"716000.00\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n# Summary:\n\n- Initial accounts payable: 0\n- Ending accounts payable: sum of unpaid purchases (716,000.00)\n- Increase = 716000.00\n\nThis represents the increase of accounts payable to be reported in the cash flow statement.",
