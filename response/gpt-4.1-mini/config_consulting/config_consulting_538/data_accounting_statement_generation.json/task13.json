Initial Value of Taxes Payable:**\n\n- From the provided transactions, the initial records are those dated \"2023-12-31\" with id starting by \"Initial\".\n- These initial records include Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets but no tax-related amounts or taxes payable amounts.\n- The sample data and problem data do not explicitly show any tax payable at the initial date.\n- Therefore, we can safely conclude:\n\n**Taxes Payable Initial Value = 0.00**\n\n---\n\n**2. Final Value of Taxes Payable:**\n\n- To calculate this, we consider:\n\n  - Taxes collected on sales (tax_amount field in sales).\n  - Taxes paid on purchases (if relevant, but usually taxes payable is tax collected from sales minus input tax on purchases).\n  - Since no explicit tax paid on purchases is mentioned, and no detailed tax credits are shown, we consider taxes from sales only (tax_amount from sales transactions).\n  - Taxes payable increases by tax on sales.\n  \n- Sum all the **tax_amount** fields for all sales transactions.\n\n- Letâ€™s analyze sales rows (type = \"Sale\") to sum up tax_amount:\n\n  Checking all sales rows:\n\n  (Tax amounts from sales in the problem snippet)\n\n  -
