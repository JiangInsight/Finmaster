6,657.84 + 14,216.99 + 14,216.99 + others...\n\nBecause full sum is long, let's sum all expense amounts from the table directly:\n\nSum of Expense amounts (all Expense and Depreciation types):\n\n11406.69 + 2296.4 + 4123.93 + 6657.84 + 3054.48 + 15779.23 + 4102.96 + 3093.29 + 12770.5 + 8026.41 + 11640.26 + 2017.12 + 13673.38 + 16231.75 + 17491.65 + 15573.97 + 16409.05 + 16585.16 +

expenses is needed, sum all provided expense `amount` from the data given.\n\nAlternatively, to approximate:\n\nCalculate total expenses roughly by noticing that per entry, admin, sales, and financial expenses are around thousands, and many entries.\n\nGiven that sales revenues are about 2.3 million, and cost goods sold about 1 million, and seeing about 100+ expense entries around 5,000 to 20,000 each:\n\nAssuming approx average expense per entry ~ 10,000 and about 60 entries: 10,000 * 60 = 600,000 roughly.\n\nGiven exactness is better, let's sum the expenses explicitly by summing all
