Expense20240130001:\n - Recorded amount 37712.1 is different from original 32705.96 indicated in risk_issues.\n - Recorded payment/receipt_status 'Unpaid' whereas original is 'Paid'.\n \n2. Interest20240116016:\n - Recorded payment/receipt_status 'Paid' vs original 'Unpaid'.\n - Recorded amount 440.5 vs original 411.8.\n\nThus, listing these two:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"Expense20240130001\",\n    \"recorded_amount\": \"37712.10\",\n    \"correct_amount\": \"32705.96\",\n    \"recorded_payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n    \"correct_payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"Interest20240116016\",\n    \"recorded_payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n    \"correct_payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n    \"recorded_amount\": \"440.5\",\n    \"correct_amount\": \"411.8\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nNo other errors found based on data consistency of calculations and logics with invoice details.\n\nHence final output focusing on identified inconsistencies:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": [\n  {\"id\": \"Expense20240130001\",\n   \"recorded_amount\": \"37712.10\",\n   \"correct_amount\": \"32705.96\",\n   \"recorded_payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n   \"correct_payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\"},\n  \n  {\"id\": \"Interest20240116016\",\n   \"recorded_payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n   \"correct_payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n   \"recorded_amount\": \"440.5\",\n   \"correct_amount\": \"411.8\"}\n]}\n```",
