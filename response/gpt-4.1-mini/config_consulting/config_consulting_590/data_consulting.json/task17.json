In this problem, liabilities appear as Current Liabilities only since no long-term liabilities are shown, so Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Identify Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**\n\nFrom the cash flow data:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,368,775.90\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify Total Debt**\n\nFrom the balance sheet at end date (2024-02-05):\n\n- Total Current Liabilities = 631,880.98  \n- No other liabilities (long-term liabilities) are mentioned, so total debt = 631,880.98\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-1,368,775.90}{631,880.98} \\approx -2.165\n\\]\n\nRounded to two decimals: -2.17\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.17'} }\n```",
