Hence no corrections other than affirming the recorded fields.  \n- No other fields shown to have visible errors.\n\nNo other transactions show discrepancies based on invoice totals and related fields in this data snippet. Other entries possess consistent values or lack enough info to deem as inconsistent here.",
