Since other transactions show \"Enterprise Solution\" product with product_id \"P004\" (seen elsewhere), here the product_id should be \"P004\".\n- The recorded_cost_per_unit is 100000.0 and quantity 3.0 leading to recorded_amount 300000.0, these are consistent.\n\nTherefore, the error fields: \"product_id\" recorded as \"S004\" should be corrected to \"P004\".\n\nNo other inconsistencies found based on the fields given.\n\nFinal solution reflects corrected product_id.",
