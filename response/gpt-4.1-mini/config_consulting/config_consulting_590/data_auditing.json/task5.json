However, since invoice data and other rows show product \"S004\" belongs to supplier like S001 or S005. This might be ambiguous but not a strict error without more data.\n  - The recorded amount is 2000.0, but calculated from quantity 3.0 and unit price 100000.0, total should be 300000.0.\n  - Recorded_quantity and recorded_unit_price are consistent with invoice total 300000.0, so recorded_amount 2000.0 is incorrect.\n  - Recorded_preparer is \"Supervisor\" but narrative says \"Staff\".\n  - We trust fields quantity, unit_price, amount from invoice more than preparer field.\n- Therefore, the incorrect fields are:\n  - recorded_amount: recorded 2000.0, correct 300000.0\n  - recorded_preparer: recorded \"Supervisor\", correct \"Staff\" (per narrative)\n- All other fields are considered reliable or consistent with the invoice and narrative.\n- The solution reflects corrections accordingly.",
