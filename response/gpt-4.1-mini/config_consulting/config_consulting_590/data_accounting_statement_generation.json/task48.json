                        "content": "To find the final net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement, we need to compute:\n\nNet Increase = (Total cash inflows) - (Total cash outflows)\n\n**Cash and Cash Equivalents** mainly include:\n- Cash deposits\n- Bank deposits\n- Cash receipts from sales or other sources (only when payment_method is 'Cash' or inflows increase cash)\n- Cash payments/expenses (payment_method 'Cash' or outflows decrease cash)\n- Transfers between cash and bank accounts are internal movements, so they do NOT affect the net cash and cash equivalents (only reallocation between cash and bank).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Cash and Bank deposits (Increase cash)\n- Initial Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n- Initial Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n\nTotal initial cash and bank = 8,000,000.0\n\nFixed assets (5,000,000) do not affect cash.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Cash Inflows (Cash received):\n\nCount all sales or other incomes where payment_method is 'Cash' or cash inflow (excluding bank transfer). Also consider only \"Paid\" payment/receipt status for cash received.\n\nLook for transactions with:\n\n- type: \"Sale\"\n- payment_method is empty or \"Cash\" (often blank means likely cash or not specified, but safer is \"Cash\")\n- payment/receipt_status: Paid\n- amount: positive\n\nFrom examples (selected from the problem):\n\nLet's identify the cash inflows (sales and others) paid in cash:\n\nFrom the rows:\n\n- Sale20240102001: Unpaid - ignore\n- Sale20240102002: Unpaid - ignore\n- Sale20240103004: Unpaid - ignore\n- Sale20240107017: (type Sale) payment_method: Cash, status Paid, amount = 193204.06\n- Sale20240110013: Sale, payment_method empty?, status Unpaid - ignore\n- Sale20240111017: Sale, payment_method: Cash, status Paid, amount = 193204.06 (probably same as above)\n- Sale20240111017 duplicated? Not duplicated here.\n- Sale20240123038: Sale, payment_method: Cash, status Paid, 54818.96\n- Sale20240129054: Sale, payment_method: Cash, status Paid, 35752.38\n- Sale20240130056: Sale, payment_method: Cash, status Paid, 128279.10\n- Sale20240130057: Sale, payment_method: Cash, status Paid, 74300.25\n- Sale20240131045: Sale, payment_method: Cash, status Paid, 2255.80\n\nFollowing that logic, but since the data is large, let's compute cash inflows based on records having payment_method = \"Cash\" and payment/receipt_status = \"Paid\" (or if payment_method is empty and status \"Paid\" and type is sale, considered cash inflow)\n\nAlternatively, from the data, amounts with payment_method \"Cash\" and \"Paid\" status (mostly expenses/payments), but for sales \"Cash\" means cash received.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Cash Outflows (Cash paid):\n\nWe consider all expenses and purchases paid by Cash or Bank Transfer:\n\n- Expenses with payment_method \"Cash\" and status \"Paid\": Reduce cash.\n- Purchases with payment_method \"Cash\" and status \"Paid\": Reduce cash.\n- Transfers from cash to bank are internal and do not affect net cash.\n- Purchases paid via bank transfer reduce bank (part of cash equivalents).\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Ignore:\n\n- Unpaid amounts (no cash flow yet).\n- Interest receivables unpaid (non-cash transactions).\n- Depreciation (non-cash).\n- Fixed asset purchases paid by bank transfer affect cash equivalents but since we consider cash + bank jointly, they are an outflow from cash equivalents.\n- Transfers between cash and bank: cancel each other.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Calculate total cash and cash equivalents inflow and outflow\n\nSince this is a complex dataset with many entries, the more straightforward approach is:\n\n- Sum of all Initial cash and bank: 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000 (start balance)\n- Sum all cash inflows (sales and other receipts) where payment method is Cash and status Paid\n- Sum all cash outflows (Expenses, Purchases) with payment method Cash or Bank Transfer and Paid\n- Transfers between cash and bank cancel out (not affect net)\n- Interest and depreciation ignored (non-cash or non-cash-equivalent)\n- Fixed asset purchases paid by cash/bank reduce cash equivalents\n- Unpaid transactions ignored (no cash yet)\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Process the data by types and payment methods\n\nFrom the problem data:\n\n- Initial cash: 3,000,000.0\n- Initial bank: 5,000,000.0\n\nAdd all cash inflows from sales paid by cash:\n\nLooking at Sales rows with payment_method = Cash and payment/receipt_status = Paid:\n\nFrom data (filtering sales paid by cash):\n\n- Sale20240111017: 193,204.06\n- Sale20240123038: 54,818.96\n- Sale20240129054: 35,752.38\n- Sale20240130056: 128,279.10\n- Sale20240130057: 74,300.25\n- Sale20240131045: 2,255.80\n\nAdd these:\n\n193,204.06 + 54,818.96 + 35,752.38 + 128,279.10 + 74,300.25 + 2,255.80 = 488,610.55\n\n(These include only sales paid by cash)\n\n---\n\nAdd other cash inflows? No other explicit cash inflows are given (no mention of receipt other than sales).\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Calculate cash outflows (expenses and purchases paid in cash and bank transfer):\n\nSum \"Expense\" and \"Purchase\" entries with payment_status \"Paid\" and payment_method \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\":\n\n- From Expenses with payment_method \"Cash\" and Paid:\n\nSum of all expense amounts with Cash and Paid:\n\nExamples:\n\n- 7,069.68\n- 13,381.35\n- 18,522.55\n- 13,305.95\n- 11,861.78\n- 7,550.68\n- 7,928.54\n- 13,930.48\n- 17,921.98\n- 12,925.57\n- 9,840.40\n- 7,754.91\n- 16,705.92\n- 19,270.58\n- 3,803.96\n- 16,654.12\n- 4,461.27\n- 19,701.69\n- 13,134.95\n- 13,669.93\n- 10,766.33\n- 12,390.55\n- 17,959.24\n- 11,989.77\n- 3,133.97\n- 6,837.24\n- 8,191.03\n- 15,719.57\n- 13,782.27\n- 3,938.06\n- 8,383.91\n- 5,737.39\n- 3,082.57\n- 4,579.76\n- 3,342.58\n- 6,121.99\n- 6,484.02\n- 15,370.59\n- 6,837.24\n- 9,001.74\n- 14,246.91\n- 9,870.10\n- 7,914.04\n- 32,705.96\n- 22,841.68\n- 6,121.99 (repeated)\n- 4,579.76 (repeated)\n\nSince data is large, sum of all expenses in Cash excluding duplicates:\n\nI will roughly estimate sum expenses = sum above (just approximate; accurate sum would require detailed addition).\n\nSimilarly, Purchases paid via Cash or Bank Transfer (Paid):\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 300,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231002: 2,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231003: 300,000.0 (Cash)\n- Purchase20231231004: 1,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231005: 200,000.0 (Cash)\n- Purchase20231231007: 200,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231011: 200,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231012: 200,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231015: 2,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231017: 10,000.0 (Cash)\n- Purchase20231231006: 5,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231009: 200,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231014: 10,000.0 (Unpaid) exclude\n- Purchase20231231008: 2,000.0 (Unpaid) exclude\n\nSum purchases (paid):\n\n300,000 + 2,000 + 300,000 + 1,000 + 200,000 + 200,000 + 200,000 + 200,000 + 2,000 + 10,000 + 5,000 + 200,000 = \n\n300,000 + 2,000 = 302,000  \n302,000 + 300,000 = 602,000  \n602,000 + 1,000 = 603,000  \n603,000 + 200,000 = 803,000  \n803,000 + 200,000 = 1,003,000  \n1,003,000 + 200,000 = 1,203,000  \n1,203,000 + 200,000 = 1,403,000  \n1,403,000 + 2,000 = 1,405,000  \n1,405,000 + 10,000 = 1,415,000  \n1,415,000 + 5,000 = 1,420,000  \n1,420,000 + 200,000 = 1,620,000  \n\nThat's total purchases paid = 1,620,000\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Transfers between cash and bank\n\n- Transfers cash to bank: multiple 100,000 amounts, several times.
