                        "content": "To calculate the final \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" amount for the cash flow statement, we need to find all fixed asset purchases in the transactions and sum their amounts.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. From the data provided, fixed asset purchases are explicitly indicated by either:\n   - Type labeled as \"Fixed Assets\" or similar\n   - Any transactions that relate to asset purchases, typically the type includes \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or just \"Fixed Assets\".\n   \n2. In the problem data provided, there is no explicit line with type \"Fixed Assets\" or \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" shown in the data sample for this problem.\n\n3. However, in the initial example, the fixed assets purchase entry is identified by:\n   - type = \"Fixed Assets Purchase\"\n   - amount = 305354.43 (example)\n\n4. In the current problem data, the \"type\" field lists types such as \"Purchase\", \"Sale\", \"Expense\", \"Depreciation\", \"Interest Receivables\", but no \"Fixed Assets\" or \"Fixed Assets Purchase\".\n\n5. Given that only \"Purchase\" entries exist but do not have any asset name or fixed asset indicator, we cannot consider all purchases as fixed assets.\n\n6. Since the problem data does not explicitly mark any fixed asset purchases, the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" based on the data snippet given is 0.0.\n\nTherefore, the amount of \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"0.0\"} }\n```\n\n# Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"0.0\"} }\n```",
