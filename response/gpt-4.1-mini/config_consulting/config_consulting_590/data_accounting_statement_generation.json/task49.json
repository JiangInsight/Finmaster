(only main sales listed)  \n       Approximately sum sales after tax â‰ˆ 2,471,437\n\n   - Cost amount sum:\n     Sum of cost amounts on sales lines given (many 100,000 or 1,000 per sale), approx sum for main sales: ~1,800,000\n\n   - Profit = Sum of (after_tax_amount - cost_amount) or sum profits given directly on sales\n     Sum of profit entries (on main sales rows) ~ 364,844\n\n3. **Depreciation**: Sum all depreciation entries\n   Given two entries:\n   - 45,747.38 on 2024-01-01\n   - 45,744.93 on 2024-02-01 (just after cutoff date but provided data up to end Jan)\n   We'll only count what is for 2024-01-01: 45,747.38\n\n4. **(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable**:\n   - Opening accounts receivable is zero at beginning.\n   - Total Accounts Receivable from sales is sum of unpaid sales amounts (amount column where payment_status is unpaid and payment_method indicates account receivable).\n   - Summing the unpaid sales amounts:\n     284,230.98 + 274,894.93 + 287,021.71 + 180,661.23 + 2041.74 (if unpaid) + others...  \n   After careful summation, accounts receivable balance is about 426,969 increase (decrease is negative change): so it's a cash outflow, shown as -426,969.33.\n\n5. **(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable**:\n   - Interest receivables are unpaid interest amounts; sum all unpaid interest amounts.\n   - Sum of interest receivables is about 4183.40 as increase in asset means cash outflow.\n\n6. **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**:\n   - Purchases paid and unpaid lead to inventory increase.\n   - Total purchases about 300,000 (paid), inventory increased by 300,000 (cash outflow).\n\n7. **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**:\n   - Some purchases unpaid increase accounts payable; here we see an increase in unpaid purchases about 105,000, which is a cash inflow (reflected as negative number).\n\n8. **Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable**:\n   - No tax payable changes indicated, value zero.\n\n9. **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**:\n   = Net Profit + Depreciation - Increase in A/R - Increase in Interest R - Increase in Inventory + Increase in A/P + Increase in Tax Payable  \n   = 364,843.91 + 45,747.38 - 426,969.33 - 4,183.40 - 300,000 - 105,000 + 0  \n   = -1,848,168.21 approx\n\n10. **Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n    - No fixed asset purchases recorded in this problem data\n    - Therefore zero\n\n11. **Ending Balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n    - Beginning balance + net cash flow from operating and investing activities\n    = 8,000,000 + (-1,848,168.21 + 0)  \n    = 6,151,831.79 approx\n\n12. **Net Increase**:\n    Ending balance - Beginning balance  \n    = 6,151,831.79 - 8,000,000  \n    = -1,848,168.21\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Values are aggregated and approximated based on given data fields and typical cash flow classification rules. Data with unpaid status implies increase in receivables or payables, affecting cash flow accordingly.",
