                        "content": "To calculate the property, plant, and non-current assets item in the balance sheet, including both the initial and final amounts, we proceed as follows:\n\nStep 1: Identify the initial amount of non-current assets:\n- From the problem data, the initial fixed assets entry is:\n  | Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0 | ... |\n\nSo:\n- Initial Non-current Assets = 5,000,000.00\n\nStep 2: Identify the changes in non-current assets during the period:\n- Look for any \"Purchase\" or \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" related to Fixed Assets or non-current assets items, i.e., purchases of property, plant, or equipment.\n- Look for Depreciation entries since depreciation reduces the book value of non-current assets.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Purchases related to non-current assets (Fixed Assets purchases):\n\nThe only clear \"Purchase\" entry linked to non-current assets is the purchase row:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: Purchase of Enterprise Solution (this may be a software asset, can be considered non-current asset)\n  Amount: 300,000.0\n\n- Purchase20231231003: Another purchase of Enterprise Solution (300,000.0)\n\n- Purchase20231231005: 200,000 of Enterprise Solution\n\n- Purchase20231231011: 200,000 of Enterprise Solution\n\n- Purchase20231231012: 200,000 of Enterprise Solution\n\nThere are several purchases of \"Enterprise Solution,\" which likely should be capitalized as intangible or fixed assets.\n\n- Purchase20231231002: 2,000.0 for Basic Consulting (likely an expense, not fixed asset)\n\nOther purchases with type \"Purchase\" but the product_name is consulting services or types that likely do not classify as fixed assets.\n\n- Also check for any explicit Fixed Asset purchases; this problem does not show explicit other Fixed Assets purchases.\n\n- There's no \"FixedAsset\" or similar asset purchase line explicitly in this data.\n\nStep 3: Sum all purchases of Enterprise Solution which likely are capitalized as non-current assets:\n\nPurchases of Enterprise Solution and their amounts:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 300,000.0\n\n- Purchase20231231003: 300,000.0\n\n- Purchase20231231005: 200,000.0\n\n- Purchase20231231011: 200,000.0\n\n- Purchase20231231012: 200,000.0\n\n- Purchase20231231009: 200,000.0 (last purchase also of Enterprise Solution labeled S004)\n\n- Purchase20231231010: 200,000.0 also of Enterprise Solution (from supplier 3)\n\n- Purchase20231231017: 10,000.0 Enterprise Solution (last purchase)\n\nTotal purchases of Enterprise Solution =\n\n300,000 + 300,000 + 200,000 + 200,000 + 200,000 + 200,000 + 200,000 + 10,000 = 1,610,000.00\n\nStep 4: Depreciation reduces the net book value of non-current assets:\n\n- Depreciation entries:\n\n- Depreciation20240101001: 45,747.38\n\n- Depreciation20240201002: 45,744.93\n\nSum Depreciation = 45,747.38 + 45,744.93 = 91,492.31\n\nStep 5: Calculate the ending value of non-current assets:\n\nEnding non-current assets = Initial non-current assets + Capitalizable Purchases - Depreciation\n\n= 5,000,000 + 1,610,000 - 91,492.31\n\n= 5,000,000 + 1,610,000 - 91,492.31\n\n= 6,518,507.69\n\nStep 6: Check for any other additions or disposals - none found, so final amount stands.\n\nResult:\n\nInitial Non-current Assets: 5,000,000.00\n\nEnding Non-current Assets: 6,518,507.69\n\nStep 7: Format answer to 2 decimal places.\n\nFinal amounts:\n\n- Initial: 5000000.00\n\n- Ending: 6518507.69\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"6518507.69\"}}\n```",
