Given line items \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\" with the same amount, either can be used. From the example, \"Main Business Revenue\" was chosen, so we follow the same.\n\n- Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period: Usually represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\n- Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole: Usually represented by \"Administrative Expenses\".\n\nStep 2: Extract values from the problem statement:\n\n- Main Business Revenue: 3397619.40  \n- Cost of Goods Sold: 1337000.00  \n- Administrative Expenses: 271886.07  \n\nStep 3: Put in original line item order as in the input:\n\n1. Main Business Revenue: 3397619.40  \n2. Cost of Goods Sold: 1337000.00  \n3. Administrative Expenses: 271886.07\n\nStep 4: Format the result accordingly.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3397619.40', 'value2': '1337000.00', 'value3': '271886.07'}}\n```",
