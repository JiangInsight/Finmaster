Since accounts receivable represent amounts owed to the entity by customers, a negative number here means an increase in accounts receivable (more amounts owed), while a positive number would indicate a decrease.\n\nThe problem asks specifically for the decrease in amounts owed to the entity. A decrease in accounts receivable would be a positive number. Here it is negative, meaning the amounts owed to the entity increased, not decreased.\n\nHowever, the problem wants the specific line item and value of decrease. Since the only accounts receivable line is negative, indicating an increase, strictly speaking, there was no decrease.\n\nBut the example solution interprets the value given under \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" as the value associated with the line item for decrease in amounts owed to the entity.\n\nThe safest approach is to take that exact value because it represents the change in amounts owed to the entity.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-2902136.39\"}}\n```\n\n# Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-2902136.39\"}}\n```",
