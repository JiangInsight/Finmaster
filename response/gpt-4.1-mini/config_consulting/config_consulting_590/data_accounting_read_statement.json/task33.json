We are asked to identify and extract two specific line items:\n   - The value of income arising from the entity's core operating activities.\n   - The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\n2. In the given income statement, the two relevant line items are:\n   - \"Main Business Revenue\" represents the income from core operating activities.\n   - \"Cost of Goods Sold\" represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\n3. From the income statement:\n   - Main Business Revenue = 3,397,619.40\n   - Cost of Goods Sold = 1,337,000.00\n\n4. Maintain the original line order as given: first the revenue, then the cost of goods sold.\n\nHence, the solution is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"3397619.40\", \"value2\": \"1337000.00\"}}\n```",
