Revenue is given by the line \"Total Revenue\": 3,397,619.40\n2. Cost is given by the line \"Total Cost\": 1,337,000.00\n3. The difference between revenue and cost is essentially the \"Gross Profit\": 2,060,619.40\n4. This matches the given \"Gross Profit\" value, confirming the difference.\n\nFinal answer is the value of the difference between revenue and cost, which is 2,060,619.40.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"2060619.40\"}}\n```",
