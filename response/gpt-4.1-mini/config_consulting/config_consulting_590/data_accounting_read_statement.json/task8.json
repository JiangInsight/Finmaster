Typically, these liabilities are captured in the \"Accounts Payable\" line item on the balance sheet.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n- Look for line items related to payables or liabilities for goods/services on credit.\n- In the problem data, \"Accounts Payable\" represents amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit.\n- The initial amount for \"Accounts Payable\" on 2023-12-31 is 0.00.\n- The end amount for \"Accounts Payable\" on 2024-02-05 is 462,000.00.\n\nNo other line item specifically represents these kinds of payables with clearer relevance.\n\nTherefore, the extracted values are:\n- Initial value: \"0.00\"\n- End value: \"462000.00\"\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"462000.00\"}}\n```",
