From the Balance Sheet: the amount of taxes accrued but not yet paid.  \n   This corresponds to the line item **\"Taxes Payable\"** at the end date.  \n   From Balance Sheet: Taxes Payable = 169880.98\n\n2. From the Income Statement: total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities.  \n   This corresponds to the principal revenue-producing activities, typically **\"Main Business Revenue\"**.  \n   From Income Statement: Main Business Revenue = 3397619.40\n\n3. From the Cash Flow Statement: net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's principal revenue-producing activities and other operating activities (not investing or financing).  \n   This corresponds to **\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\"**.  \n   From Cash Flow Statement: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1368775.90\n\nHence the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '169880.98', 'value2': '3397619.40', 'value3': '-1368775.90'} }\n```",
