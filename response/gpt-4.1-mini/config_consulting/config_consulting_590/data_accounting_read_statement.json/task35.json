Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services to customers are usually captured under \"Selling Expenses\" since these expenses are related to selling, marketing, and distribution activities.\n   \n2. Financing costs incurred to raise funds for production and operations typically appear under \"Financial Expenses.\"\n\n3. The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life is recorded as \"Depreciation.\"\n\n4. The total amount of taxes expected to pay or recover during a reporting period is given as \"Tax Expense.\"\n\nFrom the problem statement, the relevant values are:\n\n- Selling Expenses: 319828.12  \n- Depreciation: 91492.31  \n- Financial Expenses: 54544.72  \n- Tax Expense: 169880.98  \n\nThese maintain the original order as shown in the input.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"319828.12\", \"value2\": \"91492.31\", \"value3\": \"54544.72\", \"value4\": \"169880.98\"} }\n```",
