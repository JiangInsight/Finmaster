This typically corresponds to **non-current assets** (fixed assets minus accumulated depreciation).\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. **Current Assets** (cash, bank deposits, receivables, inventory) are expected to be realised or consumed in the normal operating cycle.\n2. **Non-current assets** (fixed assets less accumulated depreciation) are not expected to be realised or consumed in the normal operating cycle.\n3. From the balance sheet:\n\n- Initial Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00  \n- Initial Accumulated Depreciation: 0.00  \n- Initial Total Non-current Assets: 5,000,000.00 (matches fixed assets less depreciation)\n\n- End Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00  \n- End Accumulated Depreciation: 91,503.27  \n- End Total Non-current Assets: 4,908,496.73 (5,000,000 - 91,503.27 approx)\n\nThese values correctly represent the non-current assets at initial and end dates.\n\nThus, the values to take are the **Total Non-current Assets** at both initial and end dates.\n\n### Final answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"5000000.00\", \"end value\": \"4908496.73\"}}\n```",
