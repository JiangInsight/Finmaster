Look at the **balance sheet**:  \n   - \"Taxes Payable\" is listed with an End_amount of 197821.72.  \n   This usually represents the tax liability outstanding at the end of the period.\n\n2. Check the **income statement** for tax-related lines:  \n   - \"Tax Expense\" is given as 197821.72.  \n   This represents the tax expense recognized for the period (could be payable or recoverable).\n\n3. In the **cash flow statement**, the line \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" is also listed as 197821.72, indicating the change in tax liability.\n\nSince the task is to identify the total amount of tax an entity is expected to pay or recover, the direct value is the \"Tax Expense\" or \"Taxes Payable,\" both are equal here: 197821.72.\n\nHence, the tax amount expected to be paid (or recognized as an expense) during the reporting period is 197821.72.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"197821.72\"} }\n```",
