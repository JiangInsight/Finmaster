Since we want the decrease (which would have a positive value), here the decrease is negative, so effectively amounts owed increased.\n\nHowever, the problem specifically asks for the value of decrease; thus, if Accounts Receivable decreased, the value would be positive.\n\nGiven the data, the closest matching line item that references amounts owed to the entity is \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with the value \"-3149338.94\".\n\nHence, the answer is that the amount of decrease in amounts owed is \"-3149338.94\".\n\nHowever, since the amount is negative, it shows an increase in amounts owed, not a decrease.\n\nBut the problem asks to extract the specific line items and value of **decrease** in amounts owed. So if the value shows an increase (negative value), the decrease is 0.\n\nStill, the example response in the instruction shows direct extraction of the value even if it's negative.\n\nTherefore, aligned with the example, we extract the value and line item as is.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-3149338.94\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-3149338.94\"}}\n```",
