The relevant line item representing amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit is **Accounts Payable**.\n\n2. According to the balance sheet:\n   - Initial Accounts Payable (at 2023-12-31): 0.00\n   - End Accounts Payable (at 2024-02-05): 302000.00\n\n3. The increase in Accounts Payable over the period = 302000.00 - 0.00 = 302000.00\n\n4. The Cash Flow statement also confirms the **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable** as 302000.00.\n\nHence, the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is 302000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"302000.00\"}}\n```",
