Balance Sheet  \n2. Income Statement  \n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nWithin each group, maintain the original line item order as shown in the input.\n\nThe required values are:\n\n- From **Balance Sheet**: Paid-in Capital (13000000.00), Accounts Payable (302000.00)  \n- From **Income Statement**: Profit Before Tax (1588758.71)\n\nBut notice the example solution only outputs three values corresponding to:  \n- \"value1\" → Capital contributed by shareholders (Paid-in Capital)  \n- \"value2\" → Profit or loss before tax (Profit Before Tax)  \n- \"value3\" → Addition in amount owed for goods or services purchased on credit (Accounts Payable)  \n\nThus, mapping:  \nvalue1 = \"Paid-in Capital\" = 13000000.00  \nvalue2 = \"Profit Before Tax\" = 1588758.71  \nvalue3 = \"Accounts Payable\" = 302000.00\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"13000000.00\", \"value2\": \"1588758.71\", \"value3\": \"302000.00\"}}\n```",
