The task is to identify the net amount of cash from activities related to the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments (not cash equivalents) and the receipt of interest and dividends based on the cash flow statement.\n\n2. This typically corresponds to the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section.\n\n3. In the provided statement, under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\":\n   - \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = 0.00\n   - \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" = -0.00\n\n4. Since \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is the net amount reflecting cash used or generated by acquisition/disposal of long-term assets and related activities, here it is zero.\n\n5. The decomposition requires 1 component sub-item from the statement related to this activity. The only item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with value 0.00.\n\n6. Hence the net value is -0.00 (or simply 0.00), with the sub-item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = 0.00.\n\nFinal JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-0.00\", \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"0.00\"}}\n```\n\n(Note: The example format uses `'sub_items': {'sub_item value': 'xxx'}`, but here the sub-item is named \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\". To follow the instructed format closely, I will change the key to \"sub_items_Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"0.00\". However, the example shows just a single key 'sub_items' with the key 'sub_item value'. Since there's only one sub-item, naming it \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is more informative.)\n\nAlternatively, to match example format exactly:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-0.00\", \"sub_items_Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"0.00\"}}\n```\n\n# Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-0.00\", \"sub_items_Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
