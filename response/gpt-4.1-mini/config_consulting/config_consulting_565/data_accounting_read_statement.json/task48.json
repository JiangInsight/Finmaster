Here it is under the line item \"Net Profit\" with the amount 1390936.99.  \n- The second value to extract is the amount for cash payments to acquire property, plant, equipment, and other long-term assets, which is typically under a line item like \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\" Here, its value is 0.00.\n\nHence, the two values to extract, maintaining the original line item order, are:  \n- value1: \"Net Profit\" = 1390936.99  \n- value2: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = 0.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"1390936.99\", \"value2\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
