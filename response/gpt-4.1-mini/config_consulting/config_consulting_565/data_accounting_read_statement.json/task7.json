Expense accounts typically reduce owner's equity and may show up as accumulated depreciation or retained earnings changes.\n\nStep 3: In this data, the only expense-related account line that can be inferred as an expense is Accumulated Depreciation (an expense that has accumulated) and Retained Earnings (can include net income or loss after expenses).\n\nStep 4: Initial and final values for Accumulated Depreciation are:\n- Initial: 0.00\n- Final: 91503.27\n\nStep 5: Initial and final values for Retained Earnings are:\n- Initial: 0.00\n- Final: 1390936.99\n\nStep 6: As expenses typically cause depreciation and affect retained earnings, but since Retained Earnings can also include profits, the best direct expense related line item visible here is Accumulated Depreciation.\n\nTherefore, the initial value of the expense (Accumulated Depreciation) is 0.00 and the end value is 91503.27.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"91503.27\"}}\n```",
