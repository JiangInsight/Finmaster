                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to identify and extract:\n\n1. The costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers.\n2. The cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\nThese are to be found from the provided financial statements and grouped by statement: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement (if relevant). Then, maintain the original line item order.\n\n### Step 1: Identify costs to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services\n\nThese costs typically correspond to **Selling Expenses** or **Cost of Goods Sold** or similar expense accounts in the Income Statement that relate to customer order handling and deliveries.\n\n- From Income Statement:\n\n| Account              | Amount     |\n|----------------------|------------|\n| Selling Expenses     | 360961.15  |\n\n\"Administrative Expenses\" generally relate to overhead, so not specifically costs to secure customer orders. The key relevant is **Selling Expenses** = 360,961.15\n\n### Step 2: Identify cash payments for acquiring property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets\n\nThis is typically found in the Cash Flow Statement under Investing Activities, usually named like \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" or \"Purchase of Property, Plant and Equipment.\"\n\n- From Cash Flow:\n\n| Account                 | Amount     |\n|-------------------------|------------|\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets | 0.00       |\n\nSo in this case, **Purchase of Fixed Assets = 0.00**\n\n### Step 3: Verify Balance Sheet for any relevant line items\n\nWhile the balance sheet lists asset values, it does not show explicit cash payments or costs. So nothing directly relevant.\n\n---\n\n### Final:\n\n- Costs to secure customer orders and deliver: 360,961.15 (Selling Expenses on Income Statement)\n- Cash payments to acquire PP&E and other long-term assets: 0.00 (Purchases on Cash Flow Statement)\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"360961.15\", \"value2\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
