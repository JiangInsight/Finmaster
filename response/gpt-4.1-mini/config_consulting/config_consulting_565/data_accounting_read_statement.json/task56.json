In the **balance sheet**, the \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item shows a value of 91,503.27 at the end date. This represents the total depreciation charged to date.\n\n2. In the **income statement**, \"Depreciation\" is listed explicitly with an amount of 91,503.27 for the date 2024-02-05.\n\n3. In the **cash flow** statement, under cash flows from operating activities, \"Depreciation\" is also recorded as 91,503.27, which confirms consistency.\n\nTherefore, the value for the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount (depreciation expense) for the period is **91,503.27**.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"91503.27\"}}\n```",
