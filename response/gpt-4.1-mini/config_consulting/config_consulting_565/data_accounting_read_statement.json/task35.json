Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds are usually listed as **Financial Expenses**.\n\n3. The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life is reported as **Depreciation**.\n\n4. The total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay during the reporting period is captured by **Tax Expense**.\n\nFrom the problem data:\n\n- Selling Expenses = 360961.15  \n- Depreciation = 91503.27  \n- Financial Expenses = 81394.22  \n- Tax Expense = 197821.72  \n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '360961.15', 'value2': '91503.27', 'value3': '81394.22', 'value4': '197821.72'} }\n```",
