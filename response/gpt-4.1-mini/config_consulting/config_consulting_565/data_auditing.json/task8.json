Invoice text identifies supplier ID as S009 and supplier name as Supplier 9, consistent with the supplier_id and supplier_name recorded.  \n- The recorded product_id should likely be \"P001\" (assumed from product naming conventions and consistent with the product in other entries) instead of \"S001\".  \n- Thus, corrected product_id is \"P001\" and recorded_product_name remains \"Basic Consulting\".  \n- Other fields match invoice information and are consistent.  \n- The solution follows the required format.",
