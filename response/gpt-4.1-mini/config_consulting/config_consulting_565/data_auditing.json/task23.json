But given that \"Basic Consulting\" is the product name, product_id likely should remain or be adjusted accordingly.\n- Since this is the only obvious field mismatch from given row, reported as inconsistency.\n\nNo other rows show internal inconsistencies. Other fields like amount, quantity, unit price, date, payment status etc. are consistent with each other. Dates and amounts are consistent with their invoice statements, and preparer and approver align with given statements.\n\nNote: If more inconsistencies are found, they would be reported similarly.",
