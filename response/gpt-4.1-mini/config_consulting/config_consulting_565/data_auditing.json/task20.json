This contradicts the product_id and product_name mismatch: supplier_id is S009 and supplier_name is Supplier 9 but product_id is S001 and product_name is Basic Consulting (which seems inconsistent).\n- The most obvious inconsistency is the quantity and total amount mismatch: 2.0 units * 1000 = 2000, which matches the recorded amount. But the product ID in supplier data and product info mismatch suggests data entry errors (supplier_id S009 with product_id S001).\n- Since \"invoice\" is reliable, the recorded_quantity and recorded_amount are considered correct.\n- The supplier_name or supplier_id associated with the purchase product might be wrong, but as the invoice is reliable for price and quantity, no correction is proposed there.\n- No other field shows internal inconsistency within this row related to quantities and amounts.\n  \nHence, only the quantity (2.0) and amount (2000.0) seem consistent, no error to correct there given fields, but product_id may be an error but no enough info to fix it exactly.\n\n---\n\nAdditional inconsistency found:\n\nId: Sale20240122045  \n- recorded_type is \"Administrative Expenses\"  \n- invoice and other fields document it as a Sale transaction, with product Standard Consulting sold.  \n- recorded_quantity (1.0) and recorded_price (16373.34) do not match recorded_amount (14983.4) in type field  \n- The price in summary \"16373.34\" conflicts with total amount \"14983.4\"\n\nCorrections:\n- Original category: \"Sale\"\n- Recorded category: \"Administrative Expenses\" (incorrect)\n- Original price: 14983.4\n- Recorded price: 16373.34\n\n---\n\nId: Sale20240105008  \n- recorded_type is \"Depreciation\" but invoice states Sale  \n- Recorded price (28915.95) conflicts with original price (24545.58) from calculation (5 units at 24545.58 = 122727.9)  \n- recorded_quantity is 5, product is Chemical Product B.  \n- recorded amount is 122727.9, invoice supports original price 24545.58 per unit\n\nCorrection:\n- Original category: \"Sale\"\n- Recorded category: \"Depreciation\"\n- Original price: 24545.58\n- Recorded price: 28915.95\n\n- The recorded category is incorrect and cost/unit price is incorrect.\n\n---\n\nId: Purchase20231231001  \n- The supplier_id and supplier_name mismatch product_id and product_name. Supplier_id S009 is Supplier 9, but product_id is S001 (which presumably belongs to another supplier).  \nThis mismatch is an internal inconsistency.\n\n---\n\nFinal response providing details of the found inconsistencies including Sale20240122045 and Sale20240105008 as per task:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": [\n    {\n      \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n      \"Recorded category\": \"Depreciation\",\n      \"Original price\": \"24545.58\",\n      \"Recorded price\": \"28915.95\",\n      \"id\": \"Sale20240105008\",\n      \"Original date\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded date\": \"\",\n      \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"\",\n      \"Original payment_method\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded payment_method\": \"\",\n      \"Original quantity\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded quantity\": \"\",\n      \"Original receive_method\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded receive_method\": \"\",\n      \"Original amount\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded amount\": \"\",\n      \"Original tax\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded tax\": \"\",\n      \"Original profit\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded profit\": \"\",\n      \"Original Preparer\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded Preparer\": \"\",\n      \"Original Approver\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded Approver\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n      \"Recorded category\": \"Administrative Expenses\",\n      \"Original price\": \"14983.4\",\n      \"Recorded price\": \"16373.34\",\n      \"id\": \"Sale20240122045\",\n      \"Original date\": \"2024-01-22\",\n      \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-22\",\n      \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n      \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n      \"Original payment_method\": \"Cash\",\n      \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Cash\",\n      \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\",\n      \"Recorded quantity\": \"1.0\",\n      \"Original receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n      \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\",\n      \"Original amount\": \"14983.4\",\n      \"Recorded amount\": \"14983.4\",\n      \"Original tax\": \"749.17\",\n      \"Recorded tax\": \"749.17\",\n      \"Original profit\": \"9983.4\",\n      \"Recorded profit\": \"9983.4\",\n      \"Original Preparer\": \"Supervisor\",\n      \"Recorded Preparer\": \"Supervisor\",\n      \"Original Approver\": \"Director\",\n      \"Recorded Approver\": \"Director\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Original category\": \"Purchase\",\n      \"Recorded category\": \"Purchase\",\n      \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\",\n      \"Recorded quantity\": \"2.0\",\n      \"Original amount\": \"1000.0\",\n      \"Recorded amount\": \"2000.0\",\n      \"id\": \"Purchase20231231001\",\n      \"Original date\": \"2023-12-31\",\n      \"Recorded date\": \"2023-12-31\",\n      \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n      \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n      \"Original payment_method\": \"Account Payable\",\n      \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Account Payable\",\n      \"Original price\": \"1000.0\",\n      \"Recorded price\": \"1000.0\",\n      \"Original supplier_id\": \"S009\",\n      \"Recorded supplier_id\": \"S009\",\n      \"Original supplier_name\": \"Supplier 9\",\n      \"Recorded supplier_name\": \"Supplier 9\",\n      \"Original product_id\": \"S001\",\n      \"Recorded product_id\": \"S001\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n",
