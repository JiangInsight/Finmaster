                        "content": "To calculate the requested ratios, let's first identify the needed values from the financial statements:\n\n### Known Values from the problem:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,182,491.05\n- Total Current Liabilities = 499,821.72\n- Inventory = 0.00\n- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = 1,684,000.00\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = Current Liabilities (since no other liabilities are given) = 499,821.72\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,390,936.99\n- Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits = Cash and Cash Equivalents = 2,103,508.95 + 4,714,000.00 = 6,817,508.95\n- Interest Receivable = 15,414.09\n- Accounts Receivable = 3,149,338.94\n- Total Current Assets = 9,982,261.98 (given)\n- Quick Assets = Total Current Assets - Inventory = 9,982,261.98 - 0 = 9,982,261.98\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \nDefinition: Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities  \n= -1,182,491.05 / 499,821.72 ≈ -2.365\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \nDefinition: Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt  \nAssuming Debt = Total Current Liabilities since no long-term debt is given  \n= -1,182,491.05 / 499,821.72 ≈ -2.365  \n\n(same as Operating Cash Flow Ratio in this context)\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Inventory Turnover Ratio  \nDefinition: Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  \n\nHere, Inventory is zero at the end (and zero initially). This would cause division by zero, so inventory turnover cannot be calculated properly or is infinite.\n\nSince inventory is zero, the inventory turnover ratio is undefined or infinite. We should show either \"N/A\" or \"Infinity\".\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Debt to Equity Ratio  \nDefinition: Debt to Equity = Total Debt / Owner's Equity  \n= 499,821.72 / 14,390,936.99 ≈ 0.03474\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Quick Ratio  \nDefinition: Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities  \nQuick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 9,982,261.98 - 0 = 9,982,261.98  \n= 9,982,261.98 / 499,821.72 ≈ 19.97\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Current Ratio  \nDefinition: Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \n= 9,982,261.98 / 499,821.72 ≈ 19.97\n\n---\n\n### Final answers:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-2.37\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-2.37\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"N/A\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"19.97\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"19.97\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nNote:  \n- Ratios are rounded to two decimal places.  \n- Inventory Turnover Ratio is \"N/A\" because inventory is zero.  \n- Cash Flow from Operating Activities is negative, indicating low or negative operating cash flow relative to liabilities.",
