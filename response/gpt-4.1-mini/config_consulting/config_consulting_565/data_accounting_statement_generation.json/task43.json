Initial balances (cash deposits and bank deposits) and fixed assets: Ignore these as they are not operating cash flows.\n\n2. Sales: Consider only those sales that are \"Paid\" (cash received).\n\n3. Purchases: Consider only those purchases that are \"Paid\" (cash paid).\n\n4. Expenses: Consider those expenses that are \"Paid\".\n\n5. Depreciation: Add back non-cash expenses.\n\n6. Ignore unpaid sales (account receivable) and unpaid purchases (account payable) as they are non-cash.\n\n7.
