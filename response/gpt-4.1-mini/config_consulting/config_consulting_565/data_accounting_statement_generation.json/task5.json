Identify the initial Interest Receivable amount as of the start date.\n2. Sum all subsequent Interest Receivable transactions (unpaid) from the records to find the final balance.\n3. Note any negative amounts which would reduce the total Interest Receivable.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Interest Receivable\n\nFrom the initial data entries on 2023-12-31, no interest receivable is mentioned explicitly.

54.7665 = 387.3855 → Total: 3998.859 + 387.3855 = 4386.2445\n\n- Jan 11: 442.152 - 19.1665 = 422.9855 → 4386.2445 + 422.9855 = 4809.23\n\n- Jan 12: 442.152 → 4809.23 + 442.152 = 5251.382\n\n- Jan 13: 424.085 → 5251.382 + 424.085 = 5675.467\n\n- Jan 14: 424.085 → 5675.467 + 424.085 = 6099.552\n\n- Jan 15: 424.085 → 6099.552 + 424.085 = 6523.637\n\n- Jan 16: 422.305 → 6523.637 + 422.305 = 6945.942\n\n- Jan 17: 421.415 → 6945.942 + 421.415 = 7367.357\n\n- Jan 18: 419.635 → 7367.357 + 419.635 = 7786.992\n\n- Jan 19: 419.635 → 7786.992 + 419.635 = 8206.627\n\n- Jan 20: 419.635 → 8206.627 + 419.635 = 8626.262\n\n- Jan 21: 419.635 → 8626.262 + 419.635 = 9045.897\n\n- Jan 22: 419.635 → 9045.897 + 419.635 = 9465.532\n\n- Jan 23: 419.635 → 9465.532 + 419.635 = 9885.167\n\n- Jan 24: 419.635 → 9885.167 + 419.635 = 10304.802\n\n- Jan 25: 419.635 → 10304.802 + 419.635 = 10724.437\n\n- Jan 26: 419.635 → 10724.437 + 419.635 = 11144.072\n\n- Jan 27: 419.635 -

54.7665 = 387.3855\n- Jan 11: 442.152 - 19.1665 = 422.9855\n- Jan 12: 442.152\n- Jan 13 to Jan 15: 424.085 * 3 = 1272.255\n- Jan 16: 422.305\n- Jan 17: 421.415\n- Jan 18 to Jan 29 (12 days) times approx 419.635 each (with few negatives on 27,28):\n\nLet's sum Jan 18-29 ignoring negatives first:\n\n419.635 * 12 = 5035.62 approx\n\nMinus negatives on 27(-92.1465), 28(-56.5465):\n\n5035.62 - 92.1465 - 56.5465 = 5035.62 - 148.693 = 4886.927\n\nJan 30: 419.635\n\nNow sum everything:\n\n1335 + 1334.733 + 444.822 + 884.304 + 387.386 + 422.986 + 442.152 + 1272.255 + 422.305 + 421.415 + 4886.927 + 419.635\n\nLet's add stepwise:\n\n1335 + 1334.733 = 2669.733\n\n2669.733 + 444.822 = 3114.555\n\n3114.555 + 884.304 = 3998.859\n\n3998.859 + 387.386 = 4386.245\n\n4386.245 + 422.986 = 4809.231\n\n4809.231 + 442.152 = 5251.383\n\n5251.383 + 1272.255 = 6523.638\n\n6523.638 + 422.305 = 6945.943\n\n6945.943 + 421.415 = 7367.358\n\n7367.358 + 4886.927 = 12254.285\n\n12254.285 + 419.635 = 12673.92\n\n---\n\n### Interpretation: The total of all these entries is 12673.92, but this is the sum of daily interest receivable transactions.\n\nHowever, because interest receivables accumulate over time and the records include repeated daily entries, the actual Interest Receivable balance in balance sheet would be the sum of all unpaid interest receivables less any interest that has been received or written off.\n\nIn this dataset, all interest receivable entries are \"Unpaid\", meaning no receipt recorded to offset them.\n\nSince all entries are accumulative (assuming each interest is additional and not reversed), the final value in balance sheet should be the sum of all unpaid interest receivables starting from initial value 0 (because initial stated 0).\n\n---\n\n### Final Step: Format solution per instruction\n\n- Initial Interest Receivable = 0.00 (no interest receivable on opening at 2023-12-31)\n\n- Final Interest Receivable = Sum of all unpaid Interest Receivable = 12673.92 (rounded to two decimals)\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"12673.92\"}}\n```\n\n# Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"12673.92\"}}\n```",
