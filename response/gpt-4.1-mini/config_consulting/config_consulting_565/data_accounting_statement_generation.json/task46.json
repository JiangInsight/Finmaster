                        "content": "To find the final beginning cash and cash equivalents balance in the cash flow statement, we need to:\n\n1. Identify the initial cash and cash equivalents amounts on the starting date (2023-12-31).\n2. Track all cash inflows and outflows related to cash and cash equivalents after the initial date.\n3. Adjust the initial balance by subtracting cash outflows (payments by cash) and adding cash inflows (receipts by cash).\n4. Ignore non-cash transactions such as depreciation, unpaid entries, or account payable/receivable unless they affect cash directly.\n5. Also exclude transfers between cash and bank since cash equivalents include both, but transfers between them do not change total balance.\n6. The final resulting cash and cash equivalents balance after all transactions is the beginning balance for the period after these transactions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial cash and bank deposit on 2023-12-31 (from initial deposits)\n\nFrom the problem:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.0 (Not cash or cash equivalents, exclude)\n\nInitial cash & cash equivalents = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Add/Subtract transactions impacting cash (payment_method = Cash or Bank Transfer for cash outflow):\n\nWe will track cash movements:\n\n- **Expenses paid by cash**: Decrease cash\n- **Purchases paid by cash or bank transfer**: Decrease cash (cash or bank)\n- **Sales received by cash**: Increase cash\n- **Transfers from cash to bank or bank to cash**: No net effect on combined cash & cash equivalents\n- **Ignore unpaid or account payable/receivable transactions (no immediate cash movement)**\n- **Interest receivables unpaid**: no cash effect\n- **Depreciation**: no cash effect\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Analyze cash inflows and outflows in transactions from 2024-01-01 onward\n\n#### Purchases:\n\n- Paid by **Cash** decrease cash:\n  -
