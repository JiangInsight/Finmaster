Identify the initial bank deposit amount from the initial records.\n2. Calculate the net change in the bank deposits during the period based on transactions that affect bank deposits:\n   - Increases to bank deposits include:\n     - Purchases paid by \"Bank Transfer\" (inflow to bank deposit account)\n     - Transfers from cash to bank transfer (inflow to bank deposit)\n   - Decreases to bank deposits include:\n     - Expenses paid by \"Bank Transfer\" or payments from bank deposit (none explicitly mentioned)\n     - Purchases paid by \"Cash\" do not affect bank deposit.\n   - Sales receipts paid by \"Cash\" or Account Receivable do not affect bank deposit directly.\n3. Sum all inflows and outflows related to bank deposits to get the net change.\n4. Calculate ending bank deposit = initial bank deposit + net inflows - net outflows.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Initial bank deposits:**\n\nFrom initial record:\n\n| Type         | Date       | Amount    |\n|--------------|------------|-----------|\n| Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 5,000,000 |\n\nInitial Bank Deposits = 5,000,000.00\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Transactions affecting bank deposits**\n\nLook for payments or receipts affecting bank deposit:\n\n- Purchases paid by Bank Transfer (bank deposit outflow)\n\n- Transfers from cash to bank transfer (bank deposit inflow)\n\n- Expenses paid by Bank Transfer (bank deposit outflow)\n\n- Purchases paid by Cash or Account Payable do NOT affect bank deposit directly.\n\n---\n\n**Purchases paid by Bank Transfer (cash outflow from bank deposit):**\n\n| ID            | Amount     | Payment Method  |\n|---------------|------------|-----------------|\n| Purchase20231231002 | 1000.0       | Bank Transfer   |\n| Purchase20231231005 | 20000.0      | Bank Transfer   |\n| Purchase20231231006 | 10000.0      | Bank Transfer   |\n| Purchase20231231009 | 1000.0       | Bank Transfer   |\n| Purchase20231231011 | 200000.0     | Bank Transfer   |\n| Purchase20231231012 | 20000.0      | Bank Transfer   |\n| Purchase20231231013 | 10000.0      | Bank Transfer   |\n| Purchase20231231015 | 20000.0      | Bank Transfer   |\n| Purchase20231231019 | 300000.0     | Bank Transfer   |\n| Purchase20231231020 |  (Unpaid)    | Account Payable (ignored for bank deposit) |\n| Purchase20231231021 | 20000.0      | Cash not bank transfer (ignored)  |\n\nNote: Some purchase IDs in the second table do not appear to have bank transfer as payment method.
