                        "content": "To calculate the property, plant, and non-current assets item in the balance sheet, including both the initial and final balances, we use the following approach:\n\nStep 1: Identify the initial value of non-current assets  \n- From the initial records, find the entry labeled \"Fixed Assets\" or similar for the initial date (2023-12-31).  \n- The initial fixed assets amount is: 5,000,000.0\n\nStep 2: Calculate changes to the non-current assets during the period  \n- Include purchases of fixed assets (look for purchases related to fixed assets or capital expenditures if any).  \n- Include fixed assets purchase entries. However, in this data, there is no explicit new fixed asset purchase transaction given after the initial date.  \n- Consider depreciation expense which reduces the value of fixed assets. The depreciation entries are provided (e.g., 45,751.67 on 2024-01-01 and 45,751.60 on 2024-02-01). Since we are calculating as of latest data available, depreciation reduces the carrying value.\n\nStep 3: Analyze fixed asset purchases or disposals  \n- No explicit \"FixedAsset\" or \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" record is found aside from initial fixed assets.  \n- Purchases listed are related to consulting services or solutions, not fixed assets.  \n\nStep 4: Sum up depreciation to reduce fixed asset value  \n- Total depreciation recorded:  \n  - 45,751.67 (2024-01-01)  \n  - 45,751.60 (2024-02-01)  \n  - Total: 45,751.67 + 45,751.60 = 91,503.27\n\nStep 5: Calculate the ending value of fixed assets  \n- Initial fixed assets: 5,000,000.00  \n- Less accumulated depreciation: 91,503.27  \n- Ending fixed assets = 5,000,000 - 91,503.27 = 4,908,496.73\n\nStep 6: Check for any other impacting transactions (no fixed asset purchases or disposals found), so no additions.\n\nFinal answer:  \n- Total Non-current Assets Initial Value: 5,000,000.00  \n- Total Non-current Assets End Value: 4,908,496.73  \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"4908496.73\"}}\n````",
