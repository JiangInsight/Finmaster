Beginning AR assumed zero (for period start). Summing all account receivables approx 766,850.14 increase (use sum of unpaid sales amounts).\n\n- Interest Receivable:\n\n  Sum of unpaid interest receivables is about 5,853.31 increased.\n\n- Inventory:\n\n  No detailed inventory records, purchases largely on unpaid or paid terms but no inventory change specified; assume zero for (Increase) Decrease in Inventory.\n\n- Accounts Payable:\n\n  Several purchases unpaid and paid; net change in Accounts Payable is approx -7,398.00 (slight decrease).\n\n- Tax payable:\n\n  Not enough data; assume zero.\n\n5. **Net Cash from Operating Activities:**\n\n  = Net Profit + Depreciation - Increase in Accounts Receivable - Increase in Interest Receivable - Increase in Inventory + Increase in Accounts Payable + Increase in Tax Payable\n\n  = 179,850.69 + 91,503.27 - 766,850.14 - 5,853.31 + 0 - 7,398.00 + 0  \n  = approx -566,559.70 (negative cash flow, mainly due to large AR increase)\n\n6. **Cash Flow from Investing Activities:**\n\n- No purchases of fixed assets shown in this subset, so zero.\n\n7. **Cash and Cash Equivalents:**\n\n- Beginning: 8,000,000.00  \n- Net Increase: -566,559.70  \n- Ending Balance = 7,433,440.30\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The company made net profit but cash flow from operations is negative, mainly because of increase in accounts receivable (sales made on credit).\n\n- No investing activities occurred.\n\n- Ending cash decreased from beginning mainly due to working capital changes.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** This solution is based on available data and reasonable assumptions on missing info.
