In this problem, only current liabilities are provided and no explicit long-term debt details are given.\n\nWe will consider:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51\n- No long-term debt explicitly stated, assume total debt = total current liabilities.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-1,028,375.55}{378,850.51} = -2.715 \\approx -2.72\n\\]\n\nThe negative ratio indicates that the cash flow from operations is negative compared to the debt, which usually implies inability to cover debt by operating cash flow.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-2.72\"}}\n```",
