Generally, these are non-current assets such as fixed assets, property, plant, and equipment, etc.\n\nFrom the given balance sheet data:\n\n- Current assets include: Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, and Total Current Assets.\n- Non-current assets include: Fixed Assets, Accumulated Depreciation (which reduces the value of Fixed Assets), and Total Non-current Assets.\n- Total Assets is the sum of Total Current Assets and Total Non-current Assets.\n\nSince the question asks for assets *not expected to be realised or intended for sale or consumption in the normal operating cycle*, that corresponds to **non-current assets** (e.g., Fixed Assets, Net of Accumulated Depreciation).\n\nThe line item for **Total Non-current Assets** contains this exact value already netted.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Initial Total Non-current Assets: 5,000,000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- Ending Total Non-current Assets: 4,993,018.52 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\nHence, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '4993018.52'}}\n```",
