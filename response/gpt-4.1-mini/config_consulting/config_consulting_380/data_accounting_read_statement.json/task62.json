Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit — typically **Accounts Receivable** from the Balance Sheet.\n2. Financing costs incurred by the enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation — typically **Financial Expenses** from the Income Statement.\n3. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets — typically **Purchase of Fixed Assets** from the Cash Flow Statement.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: From the Balance Sheet\n- The line item representing amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit is **Accounts Receivable**.\n- Value (End_amount): 2,117,339.65\n\n### Step 2: From the Income Statement\n- Financing costs incurred to raise funds are represented by **Financial Expenses**.\n- Value: 37,809.98\n\n### Step 3: From the Cash Flow Statement\n- Cash payments to acquire fixed assets are under **Purchase of Fixed Assets**.\n- Value: 85,889.19\n\n---\n\n### Final solution output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"2117339.65\", \"value2\": \"37809.98\", \"value3\": \"85889.19\"}}\n```",
