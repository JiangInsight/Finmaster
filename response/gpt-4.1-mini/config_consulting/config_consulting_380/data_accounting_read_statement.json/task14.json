These are typically represented under \"Current Liabilities.\"\n\nFrom the problem data:\n\n- Total Current Liabilities (expected to be settled in the operating cycle):\n  - Initial amount (2023-12-31): 0.00\n  - End amount (2024-02-05): 378,850.51\n\nSince the problem explicitly provides \"Total Current Liabilities,\" which include line items such as Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable, this value represents the total liabilities expected to settle in the normal course of business cycle.\n\nHence:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"378850.51\"}}\n```",
