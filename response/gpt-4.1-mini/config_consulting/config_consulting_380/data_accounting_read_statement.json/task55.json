Typically, this will be represented by line items such as \"Tax Expense,\" \"Taxes Payable,\" or \"Tax Payable\" within the financial statements.\n3. From the income statement, the \"Tax Expense\" is 131,850.51.\n4. From the balance sheet, \"Taxes Payable\" at the end date is also 131,850.51.\n5. Both the tax expense and taxes payable are the same amount here, indicating the total tax expected to be settled in the period.\n6. Therefore, the value relating to the total tax is 131,850.51.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"131850.51\"}}\n```",
