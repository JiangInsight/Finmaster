In the given problem, the closest relevant line item is:\n\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -203000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n\n\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" captures changes in assets related to goods held for sale or being produced/manufactured.\n\nSince the amount listed is -203000.00, it indicates an increase in inventory (cash outflow). But the question asks for the reduction in amount of such assets, which means a decrease in inventory (which would be positive if cash is inflow). Here, the amount is negative, indicating an increase in inventory (i.e., cash used to increase assets held for sale or production).\n\nStill, this is the line item most relevant and fitting the description requested.\n\nTherefore, the value extracted is \"-203000.00\" associated with \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory.\"\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-203000.00\"}}\n```",
