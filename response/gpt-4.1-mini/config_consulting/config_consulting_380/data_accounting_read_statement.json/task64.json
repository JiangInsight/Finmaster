                        "content": "Step 1: Identify and extract the three specific line items and values:\n\n- From the **Income Statement**:  \n  \"the end value of profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense\"  \n  This corresponds to **Profit Before Tax**: 967117.02\n\n- From the **Balance Sheet**:  \n  \"the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period\"  \n  This refers to the increase in **Accounts Payable**: End amount is 247000.00 (initial was 0.00, so addition is 247000.00)\n\n- From the **Balance Sheet** (or based on standard definition):  \n  \"capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares\" corresponds to **Paid-in Capital**: 13000000.00\n\nStep 2: There is no relevant line item given in the Cash Flow Statement for capital contributed by shareholders, so the Paid-in Capital must be taken from Balance Sheet.\n\nStep 3: Group outputs by financial statement in order: 1. Balance Sheet, 2. Income Statement, 3. Cash Flow Statement.\n\n- Balance Sheet values (in line order in input):  \n  - Capital contributed by shareholders (Paid-in Capital): 13000000.00  \n  - Addition in amount owed (Accounts Payable): 247000.00  \n\n- Income Statement value:  \n  - Profit Before Tax: 967117.02  \n\n- Cash Flow Statement: the task only wants the three items as above; no relevant cash flow line item to extract.\n\nHence:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"13000000.00\", \"value2\": \"967117.02\", \"value3\": \"247000.00\"}}\n```\n\nNote: The order value1 = Balance Sheet capital Contributed (Paid-in Capital), value2 = Income Statement Profit Before Tax, value3 = Balance Sheet addition in Accounts Payable (as per problem example).  \nBut according to the example, the third value (value3) corresponds to the addition in amount owed (accounts payable), and in the example it was from Balance Sheet, appearing third. So to follow with the example:\n\nThe example outputs:\n- value1: Paid-in Capital (Balance Sheet)  \n- value2: Profit Before Tax (Income Statement)  \n- value3: Accounts Payable (Balance Sheet)\n\nBut instruction says group outputs by financial statement in order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement, maintaining original order within each group.\n\nHence, in Balance Sheet, first is Accounts Payable (addition), then Paid-in Capital. But in example, value1 was Paid-in Capital, value2 Profit Before Tax, value3 Accounts Payable.\n\nTo follow the example clearly:\n\n- value1: Capital contributed by shareholders (Paid-in Capital)  \n- value2: Profit Before Tax  \n- value3: Addition in Accounts Payable\n\nHence value3 is accounts payable from Balance Sheet.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"13000000.00\", \"value2\": \"967117.02\", \"value3\": \"247000.00\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Final output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"13000000.00\", \"value2\": \"967117.02\", \"value3\": \"247000.00\"}}\n```",
