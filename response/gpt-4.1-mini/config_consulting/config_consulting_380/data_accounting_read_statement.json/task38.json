This corresponds to changes in \"Accounts Receivable\" or similar wording in the cash flow statement.\n\nLooking at the given cash flow statement, the relevant line is:\n- \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with a value of -2117339.65.\n\nThis line represents the change in accounts receivable, i.e., \"amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit.\" The negative value indicates an increase in accounts receivable (an increase means the company is owed more), so the decrease in amounts owed is negative here (meaning amounts owed actually increased by 2,117,339.65).\n\nHowever, the problem explicitly wants the value of the decrease in amounts owed, which according to the cash flow statement is this line and value.\n\nHence, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2117339.65'} }\n```",
