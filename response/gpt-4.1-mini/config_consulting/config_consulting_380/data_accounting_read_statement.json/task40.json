This corresponds to \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" in the cash flow statement, as accounts payable represent amounts owed to suppliers.\n3. In the provided problem, the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" line shows an amount of 247000.00.\n4. Since it is positive, this means there was an increase in the amounts owed on credit during the period.\n\nThus, the solution is the value \"247000.00\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"247000.00\"} }\n```",
