                        "content": "To identify the costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services, we typically consider:\n\n- Selling Expenses: These typically include costs related to marketing, selling, and securing orders.\n- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): These are costs directly related to producing and delivering the goods and services.\n\nFrom the given income statement:\n\n- Selling Expenses: 402699.98\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 1015000.00\n\nBoth these line items are relevant:\n\n- Costs to secure orders largely fall under Selling Expenses.\n- Costs to deliver goods and services largely correspond to COGS.\n\nSince the task asks for the specific line items and values of costs incurred to secure orders and deliver goods and services, combining these:\n\n- Selling Expenses: 402699.98\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 1015000.00\n\nTherefore, the total cost incurred related to securing orders and delivery is sum of these two:\n\n402699.98 + 1015000.00 = 1417699.98\n\nHowever, in the example, the solution only included Selling Expenses as the cost to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services (493854.67 in example).\n\nThis means the task may prefer only the Selling Expenses (costs to secure orders), excluding COGS (costs of production/delivery).\n\nBut the problem states: \"identify and extract the specific line items and value of costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services.\"\n\nDelivering goods and services is COGS, securing orders is Selling Expenses.\n\nHence, final answer should include both items separately or their sum.\n\nBut per the example, only the Selling Expenses was extracted.\n\nTherefore probably only Selling Expenses is considered as cost to secure orders and deliver goods.\n\nBut delivering goods and services cost logically belongs to COGS.\n\nGiven that, a safe interpretation is to return both line items and values.\n\nSince the example only returned one value (selling expenses), but the problem demands costs to secure orders and deliver goods, it's better to include both.\n\nBut the question says \"identify and extract the specific line items and value of costs incurred...\".\n\nSo including both line items and their values.\n\nBut the output format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'value': '______'} }\n\nSo we can provide both items and amounts concatenated or a sum.\n\nGiven the format, probably only value accepted.\n\nHence, I will provide sum value.\n\nAnswer:\n\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1417699.98'} }\n\nIf the task expects only selling expenses (costs to secure orders are selling expenses), then the value is 402699.98.\n\nBut then delivery costs would be ignored.\n\nGiven the task wording and example, I'll follow the example and only include Selling Expenses.\n\nSo final solution:\n\n{\"solution\": {'value': '402699.98'} }\n\n# Final answer below:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"402699.98\"} }\n```",
