The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life:\n   - This is \"Depreciation\" with value: 92870.67\n\n2. Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period:\n   - This would correspond to something like \"Inventory\" or changes in inventory.\n   - Here, \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" has value: -203000.00\n\n3. Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends:\n   - This relates to \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\"\n   - We see \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": -85889.19\n\n4.
