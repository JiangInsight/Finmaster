It is a bit ambiguous.\n\nGiven the instruction and the example, it only took \"Cash on Hand\" as the cash available for use. But in typical financial statements, \"Bank Deposits\" alongside \"Cash on Hand\" is considered cash available for operations.\n\nSince the problem is consistent with the example and instructions, I will provide both summed (recommended) and single line \"Cash on Hand\" amount.\n\nBut following the example strictly, the solution is only to return from the \"Cash on Hand\" line item.\n\nThus:\n\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '3000000.00', 'end value': '2602624.45'} }\n\n# Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"3000000.00\", \"end value\": \"2602624.45\"}}\n```",
