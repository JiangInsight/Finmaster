Balance Sheet 2. Income Statement (No relevant line item in Cash Flow related directly, so ignore).\n\nStep 4: Maintain the original line item order as shown in the input.\n\nThus,\n\n- value1 (funds deposit into a bank) = 4283110.81 (Balance Sheet: Bank Deposits)\n- value2 (income earned from financial assets) = 15023.59 (Income Statement: Interest Income)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"4283110.81\", \"value2\": \"15023.59\"}}\n```",
