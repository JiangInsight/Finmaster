But here product_id and supplier_id mix is evident.\n- Recorded_amount is consistent with quantity and unit price, so no change.\n- Approver and preparer fields were inconsistent in input but corrected to Supervisor and Director per invoice description.\n\nNo other fields have numeric inconsistencies.\n\nHence solution reflects correction of recorded_preparer field from \"Staff\" to \"Supervisor\", and recorded_product_id correct to \"S002\" to match product, supplier unchanged. The originally recorded product_id was \"S002\" but was given as supplier in explanation so kept as is.\n\nThe corrected record uses all fields as in the invoice text apart from Preparer corrected to Supervisor to match narrative.",
