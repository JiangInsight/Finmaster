Note the category, date, payment status, preparer, approver all consistent.\n\n**Note:** Since only one inconsistency to report was requested, only product_id correction is listed. But given instruction to output the id, incorrect field, recorded and corrected values - here shown in the solution JSON as Original (correct) and Recorded values.",
