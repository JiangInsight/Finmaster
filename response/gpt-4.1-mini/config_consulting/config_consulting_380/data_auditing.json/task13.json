This mismatch likely indicates a mix-up in product_id field (should likely be a valid product code, e.g., \"P002\" or similar, but here it is \"S002\" which is not consistent with other entries).\n\n- Also, the recorded_type is correct as \"Purchase\", so no category inconsistency found here.\n\n- Overall, no critical numeric mismatch (amount vs quantity * unit price) detected.\n\n- No other inconsistencies apparent from given fields for this transaction.\n\nHence no corrections necessary except to note that product_id field is suspicious (likely error in product_id recorded as 'S002' instead of product code).\n\nNote: Other rows in the problem appear consistent based on invoice and fields cross-check.\n\nIf you want me to detect all inconsistencies in the whole dataset or focus only on entries with conflicts, please let me know.",
