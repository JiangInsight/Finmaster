Identify Operating Activities:\n\nOperating activities primarily include:\n\n- Cash received from customers (Sales, when `payment/receipt_status` is \"Paid\" and payment_method indicates cash or equivalent).\n- Cash paid to suppliers for purchases (Purchases with payment made).\n- Cash paid for operating expenses (Administrative, Sales, Financial Expenses that are \"Paid\").\n- Adjustments for non-cash items such as Depreciation (added back).\n- Interest received or paid related to operations (Interest receivables here are unpaid and are non-cash, so excluded).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Data extraction for cash flow from operating activities\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- Ignore initial deposits (cash/bank) and fixed asset transactions (non-operating).\n- Include:\n  - Sales amount for those Sales that are **Paid** (cash received from customers).\n  - Purchases amounts for those Purchases that are **Paid** (cash paid to suppliers).\n  - Expense amounts for those expenses that are categorized as Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, or Financial Expenses and are **Paid** (cash paid for operating expenses).\n  - Add back Depreciation (non-cash expense).\n  \n- Ignore:\n  - Unpaid Purchases and Sales (these reflect working capital but not cash flows, unless specifically asked).\n  - Interest receivables are unpaid and non-cash; do not affect cash flow.\n  - Transfers between cash and bank are financing activities or cash equivalents transfers, not operating cash flow.\n\n---\n\n### 3.
