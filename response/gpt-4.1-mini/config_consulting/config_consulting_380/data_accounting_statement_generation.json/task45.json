There are other purchase transactions but mostly for standard consulting or software, usually categorized differently. We need to confirm if any other fixed asset purchase or sale are mentioned:\n\n- \"FixedAsset\" or \"Fixed Assets\" purchase entries:\n\n  - Only one clear fixed asset purchase: 85,889.19\n\nFrom initial entries, we check:\n\n- Initial entries like \"Fixed Assets\" on 2023-12-31 with amount 5,000,000 is a beginning balance, so ignored for cash flow.\n\n- No entries explicitly for fixed asset sales or disposals.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate net cash flow from investing activities\n\n- Sum of cash outflows (capital expenditures) = 85,889.19\n\n- Sum of cash inflows from sale of fixed assets = 0 (none recorded)\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Final net cash flow from investing activities\n\n- Net cash outflow = -85,889.19\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-85889.19\"}}\n```",
