Identify all \"Purchase\" transactions related to products with product IDs S001, S002, S003, S004 (all seem to be product IDs).\n2. Sum the amount values from these purchase records because we assume all purchases are for inventory (goods).\n3. Ignore other expenses, administrative expenses, sales expenses, depreciation, interest receivables and fixed asset purchases as these do not count toward COGS.\n\nLet's sum the purchase amounts:\n- Purchase20231231001: 10000.0 (S002, Standard Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231002: 10000.0 (S002, Standard Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231003: 1000.0 (S001, Basic Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231004: 40000.0 (S003, Premium Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231005: 5000.0 (S002, Standard Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231006: 40000.0 (S003, Premium Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231007: 15000.0 (S002, Standard Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231009: 20000.0 (S003, Premium Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231010: 20000.0 (S003, Premium Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231012: 5000.0 (S002, Standard Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231014: 20000.0 (S005 or typo, checking only S003/S002/S001/S004 in problem, skip unknown product if any)\n- Purchase20231231015: 20000.0 (S003, Premium Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231016: 40000.0 (S003, Premium Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231017: 2000.0 (S001, Basic Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231018: 100000.0 (S004, Enterprise Solution)\n- Purchase20231231019: 20000.0 (S004, Enterprise Solution)\n- Purchase20231231020: 1000.0 (S001, Basic Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231023: 3000.0 (S001, Basic Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231024: 20000.0 (S003, Premium Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231025: 5000.0 (S002, Standard Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231026: 100000.0 (S004, Enterprise Solution)\n- Purchase20231231027: 10000.0 (S002, Standard Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231028: 200000.0 (S004, Enterprise Solution)\n- Purchase20231231029: 3000.0 (S001, Basic Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231021: 1000.0 (S001, Basic Consulting)\n- Purchase20231231022: 5000.0 (S002, Standard Consulting)\n\nSum these values:\n\n10000\n+ 10000\n+ 1000\n+ 40000\n+ 5000\n+ 40000\n+ 15000\n+ 20000\n+ 20000\n+ 5000\n+ 20000\n+ 20000\n+ 40000\n+ 2000\n+ 100000\n+ 20000\n+ 1000\n+ 3000\n+ 20000\n+ 5000\n+ 100000\n+ 10000\n+ 200000\n+ 3000\n+ 1000\n+ 5000\n\nLet's add stepwise:\n\n- 10000 + 10000 = 20000\n- 20000 + 1000 = 21000\n- 21000 + 40000 = 61000\n- 61000 + 5000 = 66000\n- 66000 + 40000 = 106000\n- 106000 + 15000 = 121000\n- 121000 + 20000 = 141000\n- 141000 + 20000 = 161000\n- 161000 + 5000 = 166000\n- 166000 + 20000 = 186000\n- 186000 + 20000 = 206000\n- 206000 + 40000 = 246000\n- 246000 + 2000 = 248000\n- 248000 + 100000 = 348000\n- 348000 + 20000 = 368000\n- 368000 + 1000 = 369000\n- 369000 + 3000 = 372000\n- 372000 + 20000 = 392000\n- 392000 + 5000 = 397000\n- 397000 + 100000 = 497000\n- 497000 + 10000 = 507000\n- 507000 + 200000 = 707000\n- 707000 + 3000 = 710000\n- 710000 + 1000 = 711000\n- 711000 + 5000 = 716000\n\nFinal sum of purchase amounts = 716,000.00\n\nTherefore, the Cost of Goods Sold based on these purchase transactions is 716,000.00.\n\nAnswer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"716000.00\"}}\n```",
