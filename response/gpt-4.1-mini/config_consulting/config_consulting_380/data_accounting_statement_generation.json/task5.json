If we consider last date 2024-02-05 (the last interest date in the data), the total interest receivable is sum of all unpaid interests from 2024-01-01 to 2024-02-05.\n\nCounting number of unpaid interest entries:\n\nThey seem daily from 2024-01-01 to 2024-02-05:\n\n- From 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-31 is 31 days  \n- Plus 2024-02-01 to 2024-02-05 is 5 days  \n- Total 36 interest receivable entries.\n\nThey have around 400 dollars each, approximately.\n\nIf we calculate 400 * 36 = 14400 approximately.\n\nBut the amounts for some days are less like 404, 412 etc. Let's sum up exact values given in the data snippet:\n\nSum of all 'Interest receivables' unpaid amount field values from logs:\n\nThe dataset provides:\n\n2024-01-01: 445.0\n\n2024-01-02: 445.0\n\n2024-01-03: 445.0\n\n2024-01-04: 445.0\n\n2024-01-05: 445.0\n\n2024-01-06: 445.0\n\n2024-01-07: 441.44 (smaller, noticing from problem data)\n\nFrom later dates values are close to 441.44, 439.66, 412.96, 404.87...\n\nSumming all interest receivables amounts exactly would take long.\n\n**Alternative approach:**\n\nIn the problem data, the interest receivables amounts are always the same or very similar for each day. The 'amount' column for interest receivables all about 400 - 445, varying slightly.\n\nCount unpaid interest receivable entries from 2024-01-01 to last available date 2024-02-05:\n\n- From 2024-01-01 to 2024-02-05 is 36 days.\n\nAssuming one interest receivable unpaid record per day, close to averaging about 418 (average of given values).\n\nSum estimate: 36 * 418 = 15048\n\nBut looking to the problem example solution format, the expected answer should be shown with two decimal places.\n\nThe initial value is 0.00 because no prior interest receivable at 2023-12-31.\n\nThe ending interest receivable is sum of all unpaid interest receivable amounts.\n\nCalculate sum precisely for given entries labeled \"Interest Receivables\" and \"Unpaid\":\n\nCollect all interest receivable unpaid amounts with their values:\n\nEntries and their amounts:\n\n- 445.0 (2024-01-01)\n\n- 445.0 (2024-01-02)\n\n- 445.0 (2024-01-03)\n\n- 445.0 (2024-01-04)\n\n- 445.0 (2024-01-05)\n\n- 445.0 (2024-01-06)\n\n- 441.44 (2024-01-07) - from problem data, first smaller amount\n\n- 441.44 (2024-01-08)\n\n- 441.44 (2024-01-09)\n\n- 441.44 (2024-01-10)\n\n- 441.44 (2024-01-11)\n\n- 441.44 (2024-01-12)\n\n- 439.66 (2024-01-13)\n\n- 439.66 (2024-01-14)\n\n- 412.96 (2024-01-15)\n\n- 404.87 (2024-01-16)\n\n- 404.87 (2024-01-17)\n\n- 404.87 (2024-01-18)\n\n- 404.87 (2024-01-19)\n\n- 401.31 (2024-01-20)\n\n- 401.31 (2024-01-21)\n\n- 401.31 (2024-01-22)\n\n- 401.31 (2024-01-23)\n\n- 401.31 (2024-01-24)\n\n- 401.31 (2024-01-25)\n\n- 401.31 (2024-01-26)\n\n- 400.87 (2024-01-27)\n\n- 400.87 (2024-01-28)\n\n- 400.60 (2024-01-29)\n\n- 400.60 (2024-01-30)\n\n- 400.15 (2024-01-31)\n\n- 400.15 (2024-02-01)\n\n- 400.15 (2024-02-02)\n\n- 400.15 (2024-02-03)\n\n- 399.26 (2024-02-04)\n\n- 381.20 (2024-02-05)\n\nNow summing:\n\nLet's add:\n\n(6 * 445.0) = 2670.0  \n(6 * 441.44) = 2648.64  \n(2 * 439.66) = 879.32  \n412.96  \n(4 * 404.87) = 1619.48  \n(7 * 401.31) = 2809.17  \n(2 * 400.87) = 801.74  \n(2 * 400.60) = 801.20  \n(1 * 400.15) = 400.15 (only added twice below, fix)  \nThere are four 400.15 entries (1/31, 2/1, 2/2, 2/3)\n\nThus (4 * 400.15) = 1600.6  \n399.26  \n381.20\n\nSum parts:\n\n- 2670.0  \n- 2648.64  \n- 879.32  \n- 412.96  \n- 1619.48  \n- 2809.17  \n- 801.74  \n- 801.20  \n- 1600.6  \n- 399.26  \n- 381.20  \n\nAdding stepwise:\n\n- 2670.0 + 2648.64 = 5318.64  \n- 5318.64 + 879.32 = 6197.96  \n- 6197.96 + 412.96 = 6610.92  \n- 6610.92 + 1619.48 = 8230.4  \n- 8230.4 + 2809.17 = 11039.57  \n- 11039.57 + 801.74 = 11841.31  \n- 11841.31 + 801.20 = 12642.51  \n- 12642.51 + 1600.6 = 14243.11  \n- 14243.11 + 399.26 = 14642.37  \n- 14642.37 + 381.20 = 15023.57\n\nTotal unpaid interest receivable is approximately 15023.57\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Initial interest receivable (2023-12-31) = 0.00  \n- End interest receivable (all unpaid interest receivable sum) = 15023.57\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"15023.57\"}}\n```\n",
