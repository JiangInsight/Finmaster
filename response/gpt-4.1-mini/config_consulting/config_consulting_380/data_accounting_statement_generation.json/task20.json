purchases quantity * unit price):\n- Summed related to purchase amounts: 10,000 (2 units * 5,000) + 1,000 (1 * 1000) + 40,000 + other purchases etc., only basic consulting etc.  \n- Total approx 35,000\n\n6. **Accumulated Depreciation**: Sum of depreciation amounts (~45,753 + 47,117 etc.) ~ 92,870.67\n\n7. **Fixed Assets**: Increased by the asset purchase of 85,889.19  \nSo fixed assets end value = 50,000,000 + 85,889.19 = 58589.19\n\n8. **Total Non-current Assets End** = Fixed Assets - Accumulated Depreciation  \n= 58,589.19 - 92,870.67 = -34,281.48 (net book value negative due to depreciation exceeding asset value, possibly error or accumulated losses)\n\n9. **Total Current Assets End** = Cash + Bank + Interest + Accounts Receivable + Inventory  \n= 271,576.17 + 113,624.26 + 4,414.58 + 242,646.39 + 35,000.00 = 687,261.40 approx\n\n10. **Total Assets End** = Total Current Assets + Total Non-current Assets  \n= 718,261.40 + (-34,281.48) = 683,979.92\n\n11. **Accounts Payable**: Sum of unpaid purchases (Unpaid Account Payable values)  \nSum approx 191,000.00\n\n12. **Taxes Payable**: No tax payable recorded, so 0\n\n13. **Total Current Liabilities** = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 191,000\n\n14. **Paid-in Capital End** remains 13,000,000\n\n15. **Retained Earnings** = Total Assets - Total Liabilities - Paid-in Capital  \n= 683,979.92 - 191,000 - 13,000,000 = -12,413,020.08\n\n16. **Total Owner's Equity End** = Paid-in Capital + Retained Earnings  \n= 13,000,000 + (-12,413,020.08) = 58,979.92\n\n17. **Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity** = 191,000 + 58,979.92 = 683,979.92\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n- The negative value in total non-current assets net and large negative retained earnings imply accumulated losses or depreciation in excess of asset cost, likely due to depreciation entries and fixed assets purchased vs. accumulated depreciation.\n- Assumed no taxes payable as none provided.\n- All monetary values are rounded to two decimals.\n\nThis is a summarized balance sheet at initial and final periods reflecting the transactions given.",
