If no `tax_amount` is present, assume 0.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable:\n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Tax Payable = (Sum of tax_amount on Sales) - (Sum of tax_amount on Purchases)\n\n---\n\n### Extracting relevant data:\n\n**Sales transactions and their tax_amount:**\n\n- Sale20240102003: Tax Amount = 686.41\n- Sale20240103005: Tax Amount = 568.36\n- Sale20240104007: Tax Amount = 623.53\n- Sale20240104008: Tax Amount = 518.64\n- Sale20240104009: Tax Amount = 109.18\n- Sale20240111017: Tax Amount = 2928.94\n- Sale20240112018: Tax Amount = 14659.12\n- Sale20240112019: Tax Amount = 2940.72\n- Sale20240113021: Tax Amount = 536.78\n- Sale20240113022: Tax Amount = 2785.8\n- Sale20240113023: Tax Amount = 704.38\n- Sale20240114024: Tax Amount = 742.54\n- Sale20240114025: Tax Amount = 2366.96\n- Sale20240115027: Tax Amount = 13514.64\n- Sale20240115028: Tax Amount = 2111.45\n- Sale20240117030: Tax Amount = 14006.59\n- Sale20240117031: Tax Amount = 543.34\n- Sale20240117032: Tax Amount = 640.4\n- Sale20240118033: Tax Amount = 92.18\n- Sale20240118034: Tax Amount = 109.89\n- Sale20240119036: Tax Amount = 9670.08\n- Sale20240119037: Tax Amount = 13658.45\n- Sale20240122040: Tax Amount = 2113.25\n- Sale20240124043: Tax Amount = 2923.47\n- Sale20240124044: Tax Amount = 14929.01\n- Sale20240124045: Tax Amount = 108.63\n- Sale20240125048: Tax Amount = 2181.02\n- Sale20240126050: Tax Amount = 2936.67\n- Sale20240126051: Tax Amount = 2663.0\n- Sale20240126052: Tax Amount = 103.48\n- Sale20240127055: Tax Amount = 106.37\n- Sale20240127056: Tax Amount = 136.3\n- Sale20240131059: Tax Amount = 148.21\n- Sale20240131060: Tax Amount = 2371.03\n- Sale20240201062: Tax Amount = 655.35\n- Sale20240201063: Tax Amount = 90.76\n- Sale20240202065: Tax Amount = 729.14\n- Sale20240203068: Tax Amount = 11283.3\n- Sale20240203069: Tax Amount = 95.86\n- Sale20240205072: Tax Amount = 482.33\n- Sale20240205073: Tax Amount = 557.17\n\nLet's sum these sale tax amounts:\n\n686.41 + 568.36 + 623.53 + 518.64 + 109.18 + 2928.94 + 14659.12 + 2940.72 + 536.78 + 2785.8 + 704.38 + 742.54 + 2366.96 + 13514.64 + 2111.45 + 14006.59 + 543.34 + 640.4 + 92.18 + 109.89 + 9670.08 + 13658.45 + 2113.25 + 2923.47 + 14929.01 + 108.63 + 2181.02 + 2936.67 + 2663.0 + 103.48 + 106.37 + 136.3 + 148.21 + 2371.03 + 655.35 + 90.76 + 729.14 + 11283.3 + 95.86 + 482.33 + 557.17\n\nCalculate sum of Sales Tax:\n\nWe'll add stepwise:\n\n- 686.41 + 568.36 = 1254.77\n- + 623.53 = 1878.3\n- + 518.64 = 2396.94\n- + 109.18 = 2506.12\n- + 2928.94 = 5435.06\n- + 14659.12 = 20094.18\n- + 2940.72 = 23034.9\n- + 536.78 = 23571.68\n- + 2785.8 = 26357.48\n- + 704.38 = 27061.86\n- + 742.54 = 27804.4\n- + 2366.96 = 30171.36\n- + 13514.64 = 43686.0\n- + 2111.45 = 45797.45\n- + 14006.59 = 59804.04\n- + 543.34 = 60347.38\n- + 640.4 = 60987.78\n- + 92.18 = 61079.96\n- + 109.89 = 61189.85\n- + 9670.08 = 70859.93\n- + 13658.45 = 84518.38\n- + 2113.25 = 86631.63\n- + 2923.47 = 89555.10\n- + 14929.01 = 104484.11\n- + 108.63 = 104592.74\n- + 2181.02 = 106773.76\n- + 2936.67 = 109710.43\n- + 2663.0 = 112373.43\n- + 103.48 = 112476.91\n- + 106.37 = 112583.28\n- + 136.3 = 112719.58\n- + 148.21 = 112867.79\n- + 2371.03 = 115238.82\n- + 655.35 = 115894.17\n- + 90.76 = 115984.93\n- + 729.14 = 116714.07\n- + 11283.3 = 127997.37\n- + 95.86 = 128093.23\n- + 482.33 = 128575.56\n- + 557.17 = 129132.73\n\n**Total Tax Collected on Sales = 129,132.73**\n\n---\n\n**Purchases transactions and their tax_amount:**\n\nLook for all rows with Purchase in id/type and check tax_amount.
