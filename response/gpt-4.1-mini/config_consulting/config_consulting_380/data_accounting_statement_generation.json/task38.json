Identify the initial accounts receivable balance (at the beginning of the period).\n2. Identify the ending accounts receivable balance (at the end of the period).\n3. Calculate the change as: Ending balance - Beginning balance.\n\nGiven the data, the \"Initial\" entries on 2023-12-31 don't have explicit accounts receivable amounts stated.\n\nThe accounts receivable amounts come from sales with payment/receipt status \"Unpaid\" and receive_method as \"Account Receviable\".\n\nWe perform the following:\n\n- **Determine beginning accounts receivable balance:**  \n  From initial entries, no accounts receivable is provided. So begin at zero or if explicitly provided, otherwise 0.\n\n- **Calculate ending accounts receivable balance:**  \n  Sum all sales (and related interest receivable if needed) with payment/receipt_status \"Unpaid\" and receive_method \"Account Receviable\" or similar, as on the last recorded date (2024-02-05).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Extract Unpaid Sales (Accounts Receivables)\n\nWe filter entries of type \"Sale\" with:\n\n- payment/receipt_status = Unpaid  \n- receive_method = \"Account Receviable\" (also accounting for any typo such as Account Receivable)\n\nSum the amounts of these sales to get the accounts receivable balance.\n\nFrom the problem data snippet, samples of such sales are:\n\n- Sale20240103005: amount=11367.21 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)  \n- Sale20240104007: 12470.63  \n- Sale20240104008: 10372.82  \n- Sale20240104009: 2183.69  \n- Sale20240111017: 58578.75  \n- Sale20240112018: 293182.36  \n- Sale20240112019: 58814.47  \n- Sale20240113021: 10735.69  \n- Sale20240113022: 55716.09  \n- Sale20240113023: 14087.68  \n- Sale20240114024: 14850.89  \n- Sale20240114025: 47339.29  \n- Sale20240115027: 270292.77  \n- Sale20240117030: 280131.74  \n- Sale20240117031: 10866.84  \n- Sale20240117032: 12808.07  \n- Sale20240118033: 1843.66  \n- Sale20240118034: 2197.86  \n- Sale20240119036: 193401.6  \n- Sale20240124044: 298580.2  \n- Sale20240124045: 2172.51  \n- Sale20240125044: 124952.5  \n- Sale20240125045: 24341.12  \n- Sale20240126050: 58733.47  \n- Sale20240126052: 2069.59  \n- Sale20240127055: 2127.4  \n- Sale20240131060: 47420.6  \n- Sale20240201063: 1815.22  \n- Sale20240203068: 225665.95  \n- Sale20240203069: 1917.12  \n- Sale20240205072: 9646.63  \n- Sale20240205073: 11143.44  \n\n(Since problem data is large, I aggregate these amounts.)\n\n### Step 2: Sum the unpaid amount (Accounts Receivable)\n\nCalculate sum of amounts above.\n\nCalculating manually:\n\n11367.21 + 12470.63 + 10372.82 + 2183.69 + 58578.75 + 293182.36 + 58814.47 + 10735.69 + 55716.09 + 14087.68 + 14850.89 + 47339.29 + 270292.77 + 280131.74 + 10866.84 + 12808.07 + 1843.66 + 2197.86 + 193401.6 + 298580.2 + 2172.51 + 124952.5 + 24341.12 + 58733.47 + 2069.59 + 2127.4 + 47420.6 + 1815.22 + 225665.95 + 1917.12 + 9646.63 + 11143.44\n\nLet's add in chunks:\n\n- First 10:\n\n11367.21  \n+12470.63 = 23837.84  \n+10372.82 = 34210.66  \n+2183.69 = 36394.35  \n+58578.75 = 94973.1  \n+293182.36 = 388155.46  \n+58814.47 = 447969.93  \n+10735.69 = 458705.62  \n+55716.09 = 514421.71  \n+14087.68 = 528509.39  \n\n- Next 10:\n\n+14850.89 = 543360.28  \n+47339.29 = 590699.57  \n+270292.77 = 860992.34  \n+280131.74 = 1,141,124.08  \n+10866.84 = 1,151,990.92  \n+12808.07 = 1,164,798.99  \n+1843.66 = 1,166,642.65  \n+2197.86 = 1,168,840.51  \n+193401.6 = 1,362,242.11  \n+298580.2 = 1,660,822.31  \n\n- Remaining:\n\n+2172.51 = 1,662,994.82  \n+124952.5 = 1,787,947.32  \n+24341.12 = 1,812,288.44  \n+58733.47 = 1,871,021.91  \n+2069.59 = 1,873,091.5  \n+2127.4 = 1,875,218.9  \n+47420.6 = 1,922,639.5  \n+1815.22 = 1,924,454.72  \n+225665.95 = 2,150,120.67  \n+1917.12 = 2,152,037.79  \n+9646.63 = 2,161,684.42  \n+11143.44 = 2,172,827.86  \n\n### Step 3: Initial receivable balance\n\nThe initial data does not include accounts receivable at 2023-12-31.\n\nGiven that, assume initial accounts receivable as zero.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable = Ending - Beginning\n\n= 2,172,827.86 - 0  \n= 2,172,827.86 (Increase in accounts receivable)\n\n---\n\n## Deliver final answer:\n\nIncrease in accounts receivable = +2,172,827.86\n\nSince an increase in accounts receivable is shown as a negative cash flow in cash flows from operating activities (cash outflow), the answer in cash flow statement is recorded as -(Increase in accounts receivable):\n\n**(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable: -2172827.86**\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-2172827.86\"}}\n```",
