                        "content": "To calculate the total liabilities (initial and ending values) from the provided transactions, we consider the following:\n\n- Initial liabilities are generally from the initial balance sheet data; here, initial transactions tagged as \"Initial20231231001\" for liabilities.\n- We should identify liabilities items as accounts payable or other payable liabilities in the dataset.\n- Liabilities will primarily come from unpaid purchases and account payables.\n- Initial liabilities in this dataset: Look for \"Initial\" entries that might represent liabilities. In the given initial data, there is no explicit \"Account Payable\" or other liability amount recorded at initial date; only deposits and fixed assets are listed which are assets, not liabilities. So Initial liabilities = 0.00.\n- Ending liabilities are the outstanding unpaid amounts related to liabilities (e.g., unpaid purchases tagged with \"payment/receipt_status\" as \"Unpaid\" and possibly payment_method \"Account Payable\").\n\nStep 1: Initial liabilities\n\n- No explicit initial liabilities lines found with liabilities amount\n\n=> Total Liabilities Initial Value = 0.00\n\nStep 2: Ending liabilities calculation\n\nCheck for purchase transactions where payment_status=\"Unpaid\" and payment_method = \"Account Payable\". Summing the amounts for these will give current liabilities.\n\nFrom the problem data, purchases with Unpaid status and Account Payable method are:\n\n| id | amount  | payment/receipt_status | payment_method  |\n|-----|----------|-----------------------|-----------------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | 10000.0   | Unpaid               | Account Payable |\n| Purchase20231231002 | 10000.0   | Unpaid               | Account Payable |\n| Purchase20231231003 | 1000.0    | Unpaid               | Account Payable |\n| Purchase20231231004 | 40000.0   | Unpaid               | Account Payable |\n| Purchase20231231005 | 5000.0    | Unpaid               | Account Payable |\n| Purchase20231231007 | 15000.0   | Unpaid               | Account Payable |\n| Purchase20231231013 | 2000.0    | Unpaid               | Account Payable |\n| Purchase20231231014 | 20000.0   | Unpaid               | Account Payable |\n| Purchase20231231015 | 20000.0   | Unpaid               | Account Payable |\n| Purchase20231231017 | 2000.0    | Unpaid               | Account Payable |\n| Purchase20231231020 | 1000.0    | Unpaid               | Account Payable |\n| Purchase20231231024 | 20000.0   | Unpaid               | Account Payable |\n\nSum these amounts:\n\n10000.0 + 10000.0 + 1000.0 + 40000.0 + 5000.0 + 15000.0 + 2000.0 + 20000.0 + 20000.0 + 2000.0 + 1000.0 + 20000.0\n\nCalculate stepwise:\n\n- 10000 + 10000 = 20000\n- +1000 = 21000\n- +40000 = 61000\n- +5000 = 66000\n- +15000 = 81000\n- +2000 = 83000\n- +20000 = 103000\n- +20000 = 123000\n- +2000 = 125000\n- +1000 = 126000\n- +20000 = 146000\n\nSo total unpaid purchases outstanding = 146,000.00\n\nNo other liabilities obvious from data (such as loans or unpaid expenses labeled as liabilities).\n\nStep 3: Confirm if any other liabilities exist:\n\n- There are no entries explicitly labeled as liabilities other than purchases with \"Account Payable\" and stated unpaid.\n- Expenses mostly paid; no mention of unpaid liabilities.\n- No loans or notes payable entries.\n\nTherefore Total Liabilities End Value = 146,000.00\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"146000.00\"}}\n```",
