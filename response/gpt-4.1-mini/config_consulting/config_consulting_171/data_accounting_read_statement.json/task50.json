We need to identify the four specific line items and their values from the cash flow statement:\n\n- Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life: this is typically \"Depreciation\".\n- Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale/in production/in manufacturing: this corresponds to changes in Inventory or similar terms. Here it is \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\".\n- Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities related to the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments (not included in cash equivalents) AND receipt of interest and dividends: this is usually under \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n- Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period: this is \"Net Increase\" in Cash and Cash Equivalents.\n\n2. From the problem statement, the relevant values are:\n\n- Depreciation: 91505.05\n- (Increase) Decrease in Inventory: -485000.00\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -0.00\n- Net Increase: -862455.97\n\n3. We must preserve the original line item order, so the answer's order is value1 = Depreciation, value2 = Inventory change, value3 = Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities, value4 = Net Increase.\n\nHence the final solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91505.05', 'value2': '-485000.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '-862455.97'} }\n```\n\n# Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91505.05', 'value2': '-485000.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '-862455.97'} }\n```",
