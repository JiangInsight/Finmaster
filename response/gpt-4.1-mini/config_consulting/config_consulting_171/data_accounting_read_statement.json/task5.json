Typically, these are represented in the balance sheet as \"Inventory\" or similarly named line items.\n\nChecking the problem data, the line items and amounts are:\n\n- Inventory:\n   - Initial value (2023-12-31): 0.00\n   - End value (2024-02-05): 485000.00\n\nOther asset accounts like cash, bank deposits, fixed assets, accounts receivable do not represent assets held for sale in production or inventory.\n\nTherefore, the assets held for sale or in production is represented by the Inventory account with:\n\n- initial value = 0.00\n- end value = 485000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"485000.00\"}}\n```",
