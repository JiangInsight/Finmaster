These amounts are typically represented by \"Accounts Receivable.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Look for relevant line items in the balance sheet that represent amounts owed to the entity on credit sales.\n2. The relevant account here is \"Accounts Receivable\".\n3. Extract the initial amount for \"Accounts Receivable\" on 2023-12-31: 0.00\n4. Extract the ending amount for \"Accounts Receivable\" on 2024-02-05: 2984071.72\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"2984071.72\"}}\n```",
