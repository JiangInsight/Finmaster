Initial and final values are given for Accumulated Depreciation:\n\n- Initial Accumulated Depreciation: 0.00 (2023-12-31)  \n- End Accumulated Depreciation: 91505.05 (2024-02-05)  \n\nAccumulated Depreciation accumulates expense over time, so the increase reflects depreciation expense that affects profit or loss during the period.\n\nNo other expense-like accounts are evident from the problem data.\n\nTherefore:  \n- Initial value = 0.00  \n- End value = 91505.05  \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"91505.05\"}}\n```",
