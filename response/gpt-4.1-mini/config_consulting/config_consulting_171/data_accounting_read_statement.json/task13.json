Current assets (like cash, bank deposits, accounts receivable, inventory) are those expected to be converted to cash, sold, or consumed in the normal operating cycle, so they are excluded.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet:\n\n- Total Non-current Assets line corresponds exactly to **total assets not expected to be realised or intended for sale or consumption** in normal operating cycle.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n| Account                | Initial_amount | Initial_date | End_amount  | End_date  |\n|------------------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|-----------|\n| Fixed Assets           | 5000000.00     | 2023-12-31   | 5000000.00  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Accumulated Depreciation| 0.00           | 2023-12-31   | 91505.05    | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Non-current Assets| 5000000.00     | 2023-12-31   | 4908494.95  | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThe \"Total Non-current Assets\" is the net fixed assets after accumulated depreciation.\n\nHence,\n\n- Initial value (as of 2023-12-31): 5000000.00\n- End value (as of 2024-02-05): 4908494.95\n\nThese represent the value of total assets not expected to be realised or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the operating cycle.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"5000000.00\", \"end value\": \"4908494.95\"}}\n```",
