                        "content": "First, let's interpret the requirement:  \n- **Value1:** Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services to customers. These typically correspond to selling expenses (and sometimes administrative expenses if related). Here, selling expenses are a direct indicator.  \n- **Value2:** Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets. Typically, this would be reflected in the cash flow statement under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" or similar investing activities line.\n\nStep-by-step:  \n1. Look for cost related to securing and delivering customer orders:\n   - Income Statement lines related to this are usually \"Selling Expenses\" or possibly \"Administrative Expenses.\"  \n   - Here:  \n     - Selling Expenses = 274,260.07  \n     - Administrative Expenses = 294,758.34  \n   The common accounting practice is that selling expenses relate to costs of securing and delivering orders, so we pick \"Selling Expenses.\"\n\n2. Look for cash payments to acquire long-term assets:  \n   - In Cash Flow Statement, look under investing activities.  \n   - The line \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = 0.00\n\nSo the two values are:  \n- value1 = 274,260.07 (Selling Expenses)  \n- value2 = 0.00 (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n\nHence, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"274260.07\", \"value2\": \"0.00\"}}\n```\n  \n(Note: values converted to string format without commas, as per example.)",
