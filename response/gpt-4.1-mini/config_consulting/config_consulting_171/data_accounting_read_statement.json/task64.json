Value before deducting tax expense for profit or loss in the Income Statement is \"Profit Before Tax\":\n   - Profit Before Tax = 2147390.30\n\n2. Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period corresponds to an increase in \"Accounts Payable\" on the Balance Sheet:\n   - Accounts Payable increased from 0.00 to 381000.00, so the addition is 381000.00\n\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares is represented by \"Paid-in Capital\" on the Balance Sheet:\n   - Paid-in Capital = 13000000.00\n\nOrder to output by financial statement:\n\n1. Balance Sheet:\n   - Paid-in Capital: 13000000.00 (value3)\n   - Accounts Payable: 381000.00 (value1 for addition owed)\n\n2. Income Statement:\n   - Profit Before Tax: 2147390.30 (value2)\n\nBut the instructions say group them by financial statement in the order: (1) Balance Sheet, (2) Income Statement, (3) Cash Flow Statement.\n\nSpecific line items required:\n\n- From Income Statement: value before tax, \"Profit Before Tax\" = 2147390.30 => value2\n\n- From Balance Sheet:\n\n    - addition in amount owed for goods/services on credit during period: \"Accounts Payable\" end value (since initial was 0, end is the addition) => 381000.00 => value3 (?)\n\n    - capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares: \"Paid-in Capital\" end value => 13000000.00 => value1 (?)\n\nThe example maps values as:\n\n- value1: Paid-in Capital (Balance Sheet)\n\n- value2: Profit Before Tax (Income Statement)\n\n- value3: Accounts Payable (Balance Sheet)\n\nHence follow same order.\n\nFinal result:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '2147390.30', 'value3': '381000.00'}}\n```\n\n# Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '2147390.30', 'value3': '381000.00'}}\n```",
