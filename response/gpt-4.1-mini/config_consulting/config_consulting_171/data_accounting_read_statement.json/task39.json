The task is to identify and extract the line item and value that represent the reduction in the amount of assets held for sale, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period.\n\n2. Such reduction is typically reflected in the cash flow statement as changes in inventory or similar line items.\n\n3. In this cash flow statement, the closest matching item is:  \n   \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with an amount of -485000.00.\n\n4. Since inventory includes items held for sale, in production, or manufacturing, this line item represents the reduction in those assets.\n\nTherefore, the value to extract is \"-485000.00\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-485000.00\"}}\n```",
