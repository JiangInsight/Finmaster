We have:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets = 0.00\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -0.00\n\nThere are no other line items related to disposal or sale of fixed assets or other investments or interests/dividends received in the table.\n\nStep 2: The net amount generated from these activities is the sum of acquisition/disposal of fixed assets and other investments (which are zero here), so the net value is -0.00 (effectively zero).\n\nStep 3: Decompose into sub-items originating from the input statement. The only sub-item given under investing activities is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = 0.00.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- value = -0.00 (or 0.00)\n- sub_items: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = 0.00\n\nPresenting answer as per requested format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-0.00\", \"sub_items_purchase of fixed assets\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
