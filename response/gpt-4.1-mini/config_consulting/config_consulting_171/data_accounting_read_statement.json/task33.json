The task requires identifying two specific line items and their values:\n   - Income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities.\n   - Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\n2. Based on typical income statements and the example provided:\n   - The income from core operating activities is represented by \"Main Business Revenue\" (or \"Main Business Revenue\" line).\n   - The carrying amount of inventories sold is represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n\n3. In the provided problem:\n   - \"Main Business Revenue\" is 4879769.51\n   - \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is 2018000.00\n\n4. The order to be maintained is the original line item order as shown, so first value1 corresponds to \"Main Business Revenue\" and value2 corresponds to \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"4879769.51\", \"value2\": \"2018000.00\"} }\n```",
