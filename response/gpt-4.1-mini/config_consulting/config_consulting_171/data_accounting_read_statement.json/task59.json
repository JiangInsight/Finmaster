This is typically represented by the line \"Interest Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet at the end of the period.\n\n- From the Balance Sheet, the \"Interest Receivable\" end amount at 2024-02-05 is 13279.60.\n\n2. The second value requested is the net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period. This is typically found in the Cash Flow Statement under the \"Net Increase\" (or Net Change) in cash and equivalents.\n\n- From the Cash Flow Statement, under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\", the \"Net Increase\" is -862455.97.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- value1 = '13279.60'  (Interest Receivable end amount from the Balance Sheet)\n- value2 = '-862455.97' (Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents from the Cash Flow Statement)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"13279.60\", \"value2\": \"-862455.97\"}}\n```",
