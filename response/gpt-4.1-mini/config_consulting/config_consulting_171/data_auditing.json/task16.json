The product_id should not be a supplier code.\n- The recorded_payment_method is \"Bank Transfer\" but supplier name given (\"Supplier 9\") usually matches payment by \"Cash\" in other consistent records.\n- Based on the invoice and other details, the payment_method is likely \"Cash\" (other purchases with supplier S009 use Cash).\n- The product_id \"S003\" seems inconsistent with a product name \"Premium Consulting\" (which in other records uses S003), so might be correct.\n- Preparers and approvers are consistent. Quantity and unit price and amount are consistent.\n\nSo the main inconsistency is in \"recorded_payment_method\" which should be \"Cash\" instead of \"Bank Transfer\".",
