No inconsistency is found here, so the solution explicitly returns the same recorded values as the original values (no corrections needed).\n\nIf the task requires to identify only inconsistent records, then this record is consistent.\n\nIf you want me to analyze all rows and identify inconsistency rows only, please clarify.",
