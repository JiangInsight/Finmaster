So supplier_id and supplier_name are consistent with invoice.  \n- The product_id is S003 and product_name \"Premium Consulting\" which matches invoice text.  \n- The recorded payment_method is Cash and payment_status is Paid, which matches invoice text.  \n- The recorded quantity is 2.0 units at 20000.0 per unit, total 40000.0, matches invoice total. However, the original invoice states the supplier is S010, but recorded supplier_id is S010, which is consistent.  \n- No inconsistency found between fields when cross-checked with invoice.  \n- Preparers and approvers also consistent with invoice.  \n\nNo error or inconsistency found.  \n\nOther transactions either do not show clear inconsistency or do not have contradicting info.",
