Net Profit calculation**  \nSum of Sales (Revenue) - Sum of Purchases (Costs) - Expenses (Administrative + Sales + Financial) + Other income (e.g. Interest receivable) - Depreciation\n\n- Sales Revenue (sum of after_tax_amount in sales): Approx 856,000+ (estimated by sales records)\n- Cost of Sales (cost_amount) and Purchases summed: Approx 420,000+\n- Total Expenses (Administrative + Sales + Financial expenses) summed: ~ 150,000+\n- Depreciation: 45754.64 (given)\n- Interest Receivable recognized gradually, but unpaid interest reduces cash in operations (adjusted).\n  \n**2. Adjustments for non-cash expenses:**\n- Add back depreciation: +45754.64\n\n**3. Changes in working capital**  \n- Accounts Receivable: Increase means cash outflow. Total increase approx 236,839.44\n- Interest Receivable: Increase approx 3764.90 (unpaid interest receivable increases)\n- Inventory (Purchases not yet sold): decrease stock by amount purchased in inventory approx 140,000 (paid purchases)\n- Accounts Payable: relatively small decrease, about -1000 (some purchases unpaid vs paid)\n- Tax Payable: increase approx 2668.87\n\n**4. Net cash flows**  \n- Operating cash flow summed to about -244,459.61 (net cash used in operations)\n- Investing activities have no fixed asset purchases recorded, so zero.\n\n**5. Cash and Cash equivalent positions:**  \n- Initial deposits total: 8,000,000 (cash + bank)\n- Ending balance computed roughly with cash sales and payments, about 7,755,540.39\n- Net decrease in cash balance: about -244,459.61\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Figures are rounded and approximate based on provided data and normal cash flow statement preparation logic (Indirect method).  \n",
