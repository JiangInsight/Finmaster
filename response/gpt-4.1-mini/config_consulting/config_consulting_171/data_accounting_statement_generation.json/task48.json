outflows affecting cash and cash equivalents.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the transactions\n\n- **Initial balances** (cash and bank): \n  - Cash deposit: +3,000,000\n  - Bank deposit: +5,000,000  \n  (Fixed assets initial deposit of 5,000,000 affects non-cash assets, so exclude from cash flow)\n\n- **Cash inflows**:\n  - Cash sales (payment_method = \"Cash\" and payment/receipt_status=Paid) or Sales received in cash.\n  - Receipts not explicitly in the data (like transfers from bank to cash, but mostly transfers are cash to bank in this dataset).\n  \n- **Cash outflows**:\n  - Cash expenses (payment_method = \"Cash\" and payment/receipt_status=Paid)\n  - Cash purchases and fixed assets purchase paid in cash.\n  - Transfers from cash to bank (reduce cash).\n  \n- **Non-cash items**: \n  - Depreciation (non-cash), Interest Receivables (unpaid - non-cash)\n  - Purchases/expenses paid by bank transfer (not affecting cash)\n  - Purchases Unpaid (no cash outflow yet)\n\n### Step 2: Sum up initial cash and bank deposit\n\nInitial cash and bank balance:\n\n- Cash: 3,000,000\n- Bank: 5,000,000  \nTotal initial cash and equivalents = 8,000,000\n\n### Step 3: Calculate cash inflows\n\nSales that are **Paid** and received by cash increase cash:\n\nFrom data, sales with payment_method `\"Cash\"` and payment/receipt_status `\"Paid\"`:\n\n- Sale20240104004: amount = 47593.55 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240105006: 47555.26 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240107010: 43597.09 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240108017: 53074.78 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240109019: 293772.48 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240112025: 2334.27 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240114029: 44910.8 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240115032: 2239.83 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240131069: 14272.77 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240201071: 39826.86 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240205078: 226655.74 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240130063: 236405.08 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240130064: 13371.18 (Cash, Paid) [Actually payment_method missing or undefined here; assuming cash - but actually in table payment_method is empty, so exclude as no payment_method \"Cash\"]\n- Sale20240107011: Unpaid, so no cash inflow\n- Sale20240102001: Unpaid, no cash inflow\n- Sale20240112024: Unpaid, no cash inflow\n- Sale20240107011: Unpaid, no cash inflow\n\nLet's sum only those that have payment_method = \"Cash\" and status \"Paid\":\n\nSum these amounts:\n\n47593.55 + 47555.26 + 43597.09 + 53074.78 +

cash inflow from sales received in cash = 1,052,238.51**\n\nThere are no other explicit cash inflows like deposits or loans.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate cash outflows\n\nCash outflows include:\n\n-
