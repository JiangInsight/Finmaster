Sales with \"Unpaid\" status are accounts receivable and are not cash inflows yet.\n\n2. **Cash paid to suppliers and for operating expenses (cash purchases and expenses paid in cash or bank transfer).**  \n   - Purchases and expenses with \"Paid\" status and payment methods such as Cash or Bank Transfer imply cash outflows.  \n   - Purchases \"Unpaid\" are accounts payable and do not represent cash outflow yet.\n   \n3. **Add non-cash expenses (like depreciation) back to cash flow** because they reduce income but don't affect cash.  \n4. **Exclude investing and financing activities** such as fixed asset purchases and cash transfers between bank and cash as these are not related to operating activities.  \n5. **Ignore interest received if recorded as unpaid (non-cash) and interest expenses if it is not part of operating cash flow** (depending on company classification; generally financial expenses and interest paid are included under operating activities but interest receivable may be non-cash if unpaid).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Cash Receipts from Operations\n\n- Sum of **Sales** with payment/receipt_status = *Paid* (only cash inflows)\n- Sales entries have amounts and payment/receipt status;
