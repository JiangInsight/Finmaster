Identify the initial \"Taxes Payable\" amount — usually from initial balances or opening entries.\n2. Calculate the net taxes payable generated from transaction data:\n   - Taxes involved in purchases increase input VAT (tax credit).\n   - Taxes involved in sales generate output VAT (tax liability).\n3. Calculate the net taxes payable as:  \n   Taxes Payable End = Output VAT (from sales) - Input VAT (from purchases)\n\nSince no initial taxes payable entry is given explicitly, initial taxes payable is assumed to be zero.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Taxes Payable\n\n- From the initial entries, no tax payable is provided.\n- Therefore:\n\n**Taxes Payable Initial Value = 0.00**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate total tax amounts from Purchases (Input VAT)\n\nLook at all purchase records and sum their tax-related amounts.\n\n- Purchases have the `cost_per_unit` field and `amount` (total).\n- The tax amount is not explicitly given for purchases but can be approximated.\n- However, this problem dataset has no direct \"tax_amount\" for purchases.\n\nOn closer inspection, purchases only carry `amount` and often a `cost_per_unit`, but no explicit tax column.\n\nBut purchases are generally considered inclusive of tax if tax amount is not given.\n\nDue to lack of explicit purchase tax_amount, assume \"tax\" on purchases is zero or unavailable.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate total tax amounts from Sales (Output VAT)\n\nFor sales records, the `tax_amount` field is provided.\n\nFrom the problem data:\n\n- Sum `tax_amount` on all sales for the period.\n\nEnumerate the sales with `tax_amount` for the period from 2024-01-01 to 2024-02-05.\n\nSumming all sales `tax_amount`:\n\nFrom shown data (some selected examples):\n\n- 2024-01-02: tax_amount = 2658.54  \n- 2024-01-04: tax_amount = 2379.68  \n- 2024-01-05: tax_amount = 147.18, 2377.76  \n- 2024-01-06: tax_amount = 13122.28  \n- 2024-01-07: tax_amount = 2179.85, 9601.40, 2648.07  \n- 2024-01-08: tax_amount = 14012.64, 146.25, 2653.74  \n- 2024-01-09: tax_amount = 14688.62, 527.28, 454.31  \n- 2024-01-12: tax_amount = 12129.98, 116.71, 12179.53  \n- 2024-01-14: tax_amount = 2245.54, 9523.91, 2417.10  \n- 2024-01-15: tax_amount = 111.99  \n- 2024-01-17: tax_amount = 133.36, 538.13, 147.11  \n- 2024-01-18: tax_amount = 12504.53  \n- 2024-01-20: tax_amount = 476.14, 2907.09, 95.77  \n- 2024-01-21: tax_amount = 2696.72, 9082.73, 636.83  \n- 2024-01-22: tax_amount = 583.37, 2637.00  \n- 2024-01-23: tax_amount = 9824.21  \n- 2024-01-25: tax_amount = 574.94, 2681.40, 10920.52  \n- 2024-01-26: tax_amount = 359.916 (this one is interest, skip), no sales tax specifically listed though  \n- 2024-01-27: tax_amount = 111.04, 2323.08  \n- 2024-01-30: tax_amount = 11820.25, 668.56, 2944.95  \n- 2024-01-31: tax_amount = 2658.11, 713.64  \n- 2024-02-01: tax_amount = 1991.34, 732.15  \n- 2024-02-02: tax_amount = 14904.24, 2222.14  \n- 2024-02-03: tax_amount = 12325.64  \n- 2024-02-05: tax_amount = 14610.14, 1868.20, 11332.79  \n\nSum of these tax amounts (rounded to two decimal places):\n\nSum = 2658.54 + 2379.68 + 147.18 + 2377.76 + 13122.28 + (2179.85 + 9601.40 + 2648.07) + (14012.64 + 146.25 + 2653.74) + (14688.62 + 527.28 + 454.31) + (12129.98 + 116.71 + 12179.53) + (2245.54 + 9523.91 + 2417.10) + 111.99 + (133.36 + 538.13 + 147.11) + 12504.53 + (476.14 + 2907.09 + 95.77) + (2696.72 + 9082.73 + 636.83) + (583.37 + 2637.00) + 9824.21 + (574.94 + 2681.40 + 10920.52) + (111.04 + 2323.08) + (11820.25 + 668.56 + 2944.95) + (2658.11 + 713.64) + (1991.34 + 732.15) + (14904.24 + 2222.14) + 12325.64 + (14610.14 + 1868.20 + 11332.79)\n\nCalculate stepwise:\n\n- 2658.54 + 2379.68 = 5038.22  \n- 5038.22 + 147.18 = 5185.40  \n- 5185.40 + 2377.76 = 7563.16  \n- 7563.16 + 13122.28 = 20685.44  \n- +2179.85 = 22865.29  \n- +9601.40 = 32466.69  \n- +2648.07 = 35114.76  \n- +14012.64 = 49127.40  \n- +146.25 = 49273.65  \n- +2653.74 = 51927.39  \n- +14688.62 = 66616.01  \n- +527.28 = 67143.29  \n- +454.31 = 67597.60  \n- +12129.98 = 79727.58  \n- +116.71 = 79844.29  \n- +12179.53 = 92023.82  \n- +2245.54 = 94269.36  \n- +9523.91 = 103793.27  \n- +2417.10 = 106210.37  \n- +111.99 = 106322.36  \n- +133.36 = 106455.72  \n- +538.13 = 106993.85  \n- +147.11 = 107140.96  \n- +12504.53 = 119645.49  \n- +476.14 = 120121.63  \n- +2907.09 = 123028.72  \n- +95.77 = 123124.49  \n- +2696.72 = 125821.21  \n- +9082.73 = 134903.94  \n- +636.83 = 135540.77  \n- +583.37 = 136124.14  \n- +2637.00 = 138761.14  \n- +9824.21 = 148585.35  \n- +574.94 = 149160.29  \n- +2681.40 = 151841.69  \n- +10920.52 = 162762.21  \n- +111.04 = 162873.25  \n- +2323.08 = 165196.33  \n- +11820.25 = 177016.58  \n- +668.56 = 177685.14  \n- +2944.95 = 180630.09  \n- +2658.11 = 183288.20  \n- +713.64 = 184001.84  \n- +1991.34 = 185993.18  \n- +732.15 = 186725.33  \n- +14904.24 = 201629.57  \n- +2222.14 = 203851.71  \n- +12325.64 = 216177.35  \n- +14610.14 = 230787.49  \n- +1868.20 = 232655.69  \n- +11332.79 = 243988.48  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculate total tax amounts from Purchases (Input VAT)\n\nSome purchase records have tax embedded in the `cost_per_unit` or payment method amounts.
