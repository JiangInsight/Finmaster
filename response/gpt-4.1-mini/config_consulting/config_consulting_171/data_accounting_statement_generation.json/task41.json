But from initial entries, only Initial lines (cash, bank deposit, fixed assets), no opening accounts payable shown, so assume accounts payable starts at zero at the beginning.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate net purchases paid and unpaid:\nJust focus on unpaid purchases for accounts payable.\n\n### Step 6: Check if any accounts payable payments or settlement done (not explicitly indicated, payments status other than \"paid\" or not).\n\nIn this data, the only unpaid purchase transactions are the ones listed in Step 1.\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion:\nSince accounts payable consist of unpaid purchases, total accounts payable increase (or ending balance) is the sum of unpaid purchases: 381,000.0\n\n### Therefore, the increase in accounts payable is 381,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"381000.00\"}}\n```",
