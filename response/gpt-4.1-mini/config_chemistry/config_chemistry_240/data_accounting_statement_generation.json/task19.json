We extract the liabilities part as unpaid purchases here: 3,010,000.00  \n  (Assuming initial liabilities zero for unpaid purchases, just adding new unpaid purchases accounts payable)\n\n- Owner's equity adjustment: Add profit (7,276,433.62)\n\n- So, Ending Total Liabilities + Owner's Equity =  \n  Initial total (13,000,000) + Unpaid Purchases (liabilities increase) + Profit (equity increase)  \n  = 13,000,000 + 3,010,000 + 7,276,433.62  \n  = 23,286,433.62\n\nHowever, initial assets include cash, bank and fixed assets, total 13,000,000.\n\nGiven the problem sample solution states totals near 13 million and final near 13.2 million, perhaps liabilities are just the unpaid purchases and owner's equity is initial equity plus profit adjusted by paid purchases and expenses.\n\nReanalyzing unpaid purchases account:\n\nUnpaid purchases are liabilities and initially no liabilities were recorded except figure in initial balance which includes assets and equity.\n\nSo Initial liabilities and equity = 13,000,000 (sum of assets and equity).\n\nUnpaid purchases add 800,000 + 750,000 + 1,250,000 +210,000 + 1,250,000 +210,000 + 1,210,000 (double counting?) Rechecking only unique unpaid:\n\nUnpaid purchases in problem:  \n- Purchase20231231002: 800,000 Unpaid (Account Payable)  \n- Purchase20231231004: 750,000 Unpaid (Account Payable)  \n- Purchase20231231010: 1,250,000 Unpaid (Account Payable)  \n- Purchase20231231012: 210,000 Unpaid (Account Payable)\n\nSum = 3,010,000\n\n---\n\n**Calculate total liabilities and owner's equity initial and end**:\n\n- Initial: Sum of Initial Cash + bank + fixed assets = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000\n\n- Ending:  \n  Initial + unpaid liabilities + profit - some expenses impact\n\nExpenses are already deducted from profit.\n\nProfit = total sales revenues - total expenses (including depreciation) ≈ 7,276,433.62 (as above)\n\nEnding Total Liabilities + Owner's Equity = Initial Assets + unpaid liabilities + net profit  \n= 13,000,000 + 3,010,000 + 7,276,433.62 = 23,286,433.62\n\n---\n\n**However, problem solution format expects amounts close to 13 million, suggesting an answer similar to initial + some changes.**\n\nTo comply with sample format, just sum initial assets (liabilities + equity) and add net profit and unpaid liabilities:\n\n- Initial total: 13,000,000.00  \n- Add unpaid liabilities (3,010,000)  \n- Add net profit (7,276,434)  \n- Then subtract prepaid or paid expenses decreases cash, but net in equity\n\nAlternatively, since the initial sum includes no liabilities, and unpaid purchase increases liabilities - we should include unpaid purchases value in liabilities at end.\n\nSo finally:\n\n- Total Liabilities + Owner's Equity Initial Value: 13,000,000.00  \n- Total Liabilities + Owner's Equity End Value: 13,000,000.00  \n  + Unpaid Liabilities: 3,010,000.00  \n  + Profit (Sales - Expenses - Depreciation): 7,276,434.00  \n  = 23,286,434.00\n\n---\n\n**Format output as required with 2 decimals**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\",\n  \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"23286434.00\"\n}}\n```\n\n---\n\n# Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"23286434.00\"}}\n```",
