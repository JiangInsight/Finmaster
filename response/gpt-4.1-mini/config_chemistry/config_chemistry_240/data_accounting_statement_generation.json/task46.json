Identify the initial cash and bank deposits as the initial beginning cash and cash equivalents balance.\n2. Include all cash inflows and outflows that affect cash or cash equivalents.\n3. Exclude non-cash transactions such as depreciation, purchases and sales on account (unpaid), interest receivables unpaid, fixed asset purchases (not cash transactions here if paid by bank transfer), and transfers between cash and bank since these are internal movements within cash and cash equivalents and do not affect net cash.\n4. Sum all inflows and subtract all outflows paid by cash or cash equivalent at the period start to find the beginning balance shown.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial cash and bank deposits on 2023-12-31  \n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0  \n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0  \nTotal Initial Cash and equivalents = 8,000,000.0\n\n### Step 2: Analyze transactions affecting cash:\n\n- **Payments and expenses paid by Cash:** Decrease cash  \n- **Purchases paid by Cash or Bank Transfer:** Cash purchases reduce cash, bank transfer purchases reduce bank deposits, both reduce cash equivalents  \n- **Sales received in Cash:** Increase cash  \n- **Transfers between cash and bank:** Internal transfer does not affect total cash equivalents (cash + bank) balance\n\n### Step 3: Calculate net cash flows from cash transactions (only those with payment_method = \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" and status = \"Paid\").  \n- For purchases paid by Cash or Bank Transfer, subtract amount  \n- For sales received by Cash, add amount  \n- For Expenses paid by Cash, subtract amount  \n- For Transfers between Cash and Bank: ignore net effect since total cash equivalents unchanged  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Sum details from problem input\n\nWe will summarize the cash and bank related inflows and outflows (Paid ones only):\n\n#### Initial Balance\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0  \n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0  \n=> Starting balance = 8,000,000.0 \n\n#### Outflows (Purchases Paid by Cash or Bank Transfer)\n\nFrom purchases with payment_method \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" and payment/receipt_status = \"Paid\":  \n\n- Purchase20231231001: 190,000.0 (Bank Transfer)  \n- Purchase20231231003: 450,000.0 (Bank Transfer)  \n- Purchase20231231005: 1,600,000.0 (Cash)  \n- Purchase20231231006: 100,000.0 (Bank Transfer)  \n- Purchase20231231007: 340,000.0 (Bank Transfer)  \n- Purchase20231231008: 300,000.0 (Cash)  \n- Purchase20231231009: 2,700,000.0 (Bank Transfer)  \n- Purchase20231231014: 400,000.0 (Bank Transfer)  \n- Purchase20231231015: 1,300,000.0 (Cash)  \n- Purchase20231231011: 60,000.0 (Cash)  \n\nSum purchases paid (Cash + Bank Transfer):  \n190,000 + 450,000 + 1,600,000 + 100,000 + 340,000 + 300,000 + 2,700,000 + 400,000 + 1,300,000 + 60,000 = 7,440,000.0\n\n#### Inflows (Sales Received in Cash)\n\nSum of sales with payment_method \"Cash\" and payment/receipt_status = \"Paid\":\n\n- Sale20240106011: 270,861.76 (Cash)  \n- Sale20240106012: 465,860.56 (Cash)  \n- Sale20240107015: 88,931.68 (Cash)  \n- Sale20240107024: 226,744.92 (Cash) - Note this sale with id Sale20240111024 is from 11 Jan, not 7 Jan; Ignore this one here.
