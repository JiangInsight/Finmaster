COGS = 10,400,000 - 7,400,000 = +3,000,000 (approx)\n\nBut task example solution shows a negative value indicating a net inventory decrease, so we must consider initial inventory or starting inventory at beginning.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Initial inventory\n\nInitial inventory is not clearly stated for products but initial deposits and fixed assets are given aside (not inventory).\n\nAssuming no initial inventory (or zero), the difference (Increase) Decrease in inventory = Purchases - COGS.\n\nSince purchases exceed COGS by 3,000,000, inventory increased by that amount. But the cash flow statement shows negative (increase in inventory is a use of cash and is negative).\n\nSo, the proper sign is:\n\nIncrease in inventory = +3,000,000  \n(In cash flow format) (Increase) Decrease in inventory = -3,000,000.00\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-3000000.00\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Because the purchase and sale data is large and detailed, the calculation is an estimate based on given information and typical interpretation in cash flow statements.",
