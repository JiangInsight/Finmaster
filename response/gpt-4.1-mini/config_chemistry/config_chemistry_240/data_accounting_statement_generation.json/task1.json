Initial cash on hand amount (from initial deposits of type \"Cash deposit\").\n2. Then adjust this amount by all transactions affecting cash on hand:\n   - Cash inflows (sales or receipts paid by cash).\n   - Cash outflows (expenses and purchases paid by cash).\n3. Transfers from cash to bank are cash outflows from cash on hand.\n4. Purchases or expenses paid by Bank Transfer or other methods do not affect cash on hand.\n5. Ignore unpaid expenses/purchases or items paid by account payable or receivable or unpaid.\n6. Calculate the end value of cash on hand after considering these.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Cash on Hand\n\nLook for initial record where type is \"Cash deposit\" or asset_name related to Cash (here it's \"Cash deposit\" type entry):\n\n- Initial cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find cash inflows (payments received by cash)\n\nLook for sale or other receipts where payment method or receive_method is \"Cash\" and status is \"Paid\":\n\nFound relevant entries and sum their amounts (only cash-paid, and sale with status Paid and receive_method or payment_method \"Cash\"):\n\n- Sale20240106011: 270861.76 (Cash by sale, paid)\n- Sale20240106012: 465860.56 (Cash by sale, paid)\n- Sale20240107015: 88931.68 (Cash by sale, paid)\n- Sale20240107016: 208853.52 (Cash

672051.50 (Cash by sale, paid)\n- Sale20240102003: (Unpaid so ignore)\n- Sale20240103005: (Unpaid so ignore)\n- Other sales with cash paid accounted above.\n\nSum these cash receipts (Paid) â‰ˆ  \n270861.76 + 465860.56 + 88931.68 + 208853.52 + 207532.02 + 226744.92 + 576826.90 + 59988.65 + 23176.48 + 195282.75 + 296311.50 + 672051.50  \n= 3,806,321.24 approx.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Find cash outflows (expenses paid by cash)\n\nLook for expense entries where payment_method is \"Cash\" and payment status is Paid:\n\nSumming these expenses for all such records (many records of Admin, Sales,

to Bank transfers)\n\nAll transfers from cash to bank reduce cash on hand:\n\nLook for Transfer with description \"Cash to bank transfer\" and payment method not specified (assumed from Cash):\n\n- Transfer20240110001: 100,000.0 (appears multiple times that day)\n- On 2024-01-10 there are 4 such transfers = 400,000.0\n- Transfer20240111001 on 2024-01-11 has 5 such transfers = 500,000.0\n- Transfer20240112001 on 2024-01-12 has 5 such transfers = 500,000.0\n- Transfer20240123001 on 2024-01-23 has 5 such transfers = 500,000.0\n- Transfer20240124001 on 2024-01-24 has 5 such transfers = 500,000.0\n- Transfer20240125001 on 2024-01-25 has 6 such transfers =600,000.0\n- Transfer20240126001 on 2024-01-26 has 7 such transfers = 700,000.0\n- Transfer20240127001 on 2024-01-27 has 5 such transfers = 500,000.0\n- Transfer20240128001 on 2024-01-28 has 6 such transfers = 600,000.0\n- Transfer20240129001 not within problem data; not needed here.\n\nSum all cash to bank transfers:\n\n400,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 + 600,000 + 700,000 + 500,000 + 600,000 = 4,800,000.0\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Ending Cash on Hand:\n\nStart with initial cash on hand:  \n3,000,000.0  \n\nAdd total cash inflows (Sales paid by cash):  \n+ 3,806,321.24  \n\nSubtract cash outflows (expenses paid by cash):  \n- 1,539,033.25  \n\nSubtract cash to bank transfers:  \n- 4,800,000.0  \n\nCalculation:  \n3,000,000.0 + 3,806,321.24 - 1,539,033.25 - 4,800,000.0 =  \n(3,000,000 + 3,806,321.24) = 6,806,321.24  \n6,806,321.24 - 1,539,033.25 = 5,267,287.99  \n5,267,287.99 - 4,800,000 = 467,287.99\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Final answer:\n\n- Cash on Hand Initial Value: 3,000,000.00  \n- Cash on Hand End Value: 467,287.99\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\":
