Or equivalently the outstanding accounts receivable balance.\n\nAlso, note that some sales have \"payment/receipt_status\" as Unpaid and \"receive_method\" as \"Account Receviable\" (typo of Account Receivable).\n\nLet's gather all sales on \"Account Receviable\" and payment status \"Unpaid\" from data.\n\nFrom the problem data, the relevant fields and rows to identify are sales with:\n- payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\"\n- receive_method = \"Account Receviable\"\n\nWe find all such sales to sum their after_tax_amount.\n\n---\n\nList of \"Sale\" entries with \"Unpaid\" and \"Account Receviable\" (receive_method):\n\n- Sale20240102003: 213,713.18\n- Sale20240103005: 55,059.36\n- Sale20240103006: 116,891.13\n- Sale20240104008: 33,944.24\n- Sale20240108017: 42,370.61\n- Sale20240109020: 71,802.27\n- Sale20240111025: 628,256.42\n- Sale20240115032: 264,456.82\n- Sale20240116035: 107,632.87\n- Sale20240117036: 60,365.28\n- Sale20240118039: 118,167.27\n- Sale20240120044: 259,095.7\n- Sale20240121045: 105,934.97\n- Sale20240121046: 63,339.2\n- Sale20240124050: 223,038.0\n- Sale20240125051: 66,371.7\n- Sale20240126026: N/A (this is Interest, not Sale)\n- Sale20240126025: N/A (this is Interest, not Sale)\n- Sale20240128053: 107,742.44\n- Sale20240125044: N/A (different sale, Paid)\n- Sale20240125045: N/A (Paid)\n- Sale20240125052: N/A (Paid)\n- Sale20240129029: N/A (Interest)\n- Sale20240114031: 165,833.15\n- Sale20240122047: N/A (Paid)\n- Sale20240123049: N/A (Paid)\n- Sale20240123048: N/A (Paid)\n- Sale20240113013: N/A (Interest)\n- Sale20240111011: N/A (Interest)\n- Sale20240112012: N/A (Paid)\n- Sale20240106006: N/A (Interest)\n- Sale20240105005: N/A (Interest)\n- Sale20240104004: N/A (Interest)\n- Sale20240103003: N/A (Interest)\n- Sale20240102002: N/A (Interest)\n- Sale20240101001: N/A (Interest)\n\nThe last sale date is 2024-01-28 for unpaid account receivable at 107,742.44 (Sale20240128053).\n\nSum all unpaid account receivable \"after_tax_amount\" (the value column for account receivable sales):\n\nNow summing the values:\n\n213,713.18  \n+ 55,059.36  \n+ 116,891.13  \n+ 33,944.24  \n+ 42,370.61  \n+ 71,802.27  \n+ 628,256.42  \n+ 264,456.82  \n+ 107,632.87  \n+ 60,365.28  \n+ 118,167.27  \n+ 259,095.7  \n+ 105,934.97  \n+ 63,339.2  \n+ 223,038.0  \n+ 66,371.7  \n+ 107,742.44  \n+ 165,833.15  \n\nCalculating sum:\n\nStart by summing in steps:\n\n- 213,713.18 + 55,059.36 = 268,772.54  \n- +116,891.13 = 385,663.67  \n- +33,944.24 = 419,607.91  \n- +42,370.61 = 461,978.52  \n- +71,802.27 = 533,780.79  \n- +628,256.42 = 1,162,037.21  \n- +264,456.82 = 1,426,494.03  \n- +107,632.87 = 1,534,126.9  \n- +60,365.28 = 1,594,492.18  \n- +118,167.27 = 1,712,659.45  \n- +259,095.7 = 1,971,755.15  \n- +105,934.97 = 2,077,690.12  \n- +63,339.2 = 2,141,029.32  \n- +223,038.0 = 2,364,067.32  \n- +66,371.7 = 2,430,439.02  \n- +107,742.44 = 2,538,181.46  \n- +165,833.15 = 2,704,014.61  \n\nSo ending accounts receivable approx. 2,704,014.61  \n\n---\n\nStep 3: Determine beginning accounts receivable\n\nSince no explicit initial accounts receivable was given at 2023-12-31, we assume it to be zero.\n\n---\n\nStep 4: Calculate (Increase) / Decrease\n\n= Beginning AR - Ending AR  \n= 0 - 2,704,014.61  \n= -2,704,014.61\n\nNegative value means accounts receivable increased by 2,704,014.61\n\n---\n\nFinal result:\n\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-2704014.61'}}\n\n# Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-2704014.61\"} }\n```",
