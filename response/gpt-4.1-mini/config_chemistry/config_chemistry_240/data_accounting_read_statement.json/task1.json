Typically, these include:\n- Cash on Hand\n- Bank Deposits\n\nStep 2: Sum the initial amounts of these accounts and the end amounts from the provided data.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- Cash on Hand\n  - Initial_amount: 3,000,000.00\n  - End_amount: 1,379,124.39\n\n- Bank Deposits\n  - Initial_amount: 5,000,000.00\n  - End_amount: 126,796.33\n\nStep 3: Add initial values:\n3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 8,000,000.00\n\nStep 4: Add end values:\n1,379,124.39 + 126,796.33 = 1,505,920.72\n\nTherefore, the total cash held for daily operations initially was 8,000,000.00 and at the end was 1,505,920.72.\n\nFormat the answer as requested.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"1505920.72\"}}\n```",
