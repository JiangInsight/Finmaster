Income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities.\n  2. Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n  \n- From the given income statement, the line item that represents income from the core operating activities is usually the \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue\". Here, \"Main Business Revenue\" is given as 8,361,807.77.\n\n- The carrying amount of inventories sold corresponds to the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS), which represents the cost value of goods that were sold â€“ i.e., the carrying amount of inventories sold.\n\n- From the table:\n  - Main Business Revenue: 8,361,807.77\n  - Cost of Goods Sold: 6,720,000.00\n\n- These correspond exactly to the values required.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '8361807.77', 'value2': '6720000.00'} }\n```",
