The amount of profit an entity retains after all expenses (including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization). This is typically represented by **\"Net Profit\"**.  \n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets. This is typically represented by **\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\"**.\n\nFrom the given cash flow statement:\n\n| Account                          | Amount      | Date      |\n|---------------------------------|-------------|-----------|\n| Net Profit                      | -1342040.76 | 2024-01-28|\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets        | 1593203.67  | 2024-01-28|\n\nSo the two required values are:  \n- value1 = \"-1342040.76\" (Net Profit)  \n- value2 = \"1593203.67\" (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '-1342040.76', 'value2': '1593203.67'}}\n```",
