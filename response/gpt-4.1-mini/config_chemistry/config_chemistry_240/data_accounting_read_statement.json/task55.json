From the **balance sheet**, the relevant tax-related line item is:\n   - Taxes Payable = 418090.41 (End_amount)\n\n2. From the **income statement**, the relevant item is:\n   - Tax Expense = 418090.41\n\n3. From the **cash flow statement**, relevant line is:\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable = 418090.41\n\nAll three points indicate the same tax amount of 418090.41 for the reporting period.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay or recover during the reporting period is 418090.41.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"418090.41\"} }\n```",
