The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life → Corresponds to **Depreciation**.\n2. Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period → Corresponds to changes in **Inventory** (usually labeled as (Increase) Decrease in Inventory).\n3. Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities related to acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends → Corresponds to **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**.\n4.
