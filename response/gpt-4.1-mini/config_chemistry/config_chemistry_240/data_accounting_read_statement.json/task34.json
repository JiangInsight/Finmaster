Identify the total income arising in the course of ordinary activities:\n   - The likely line for total income is \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue\".\n   - Both \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\" are 8361807.77, so we take \"Main Business Revenue\" since it's the first in order.\n\n2. Identify the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period:\n   - This is usually represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n   - \"Cost of Goods Sold\" amount is 6720000.00.\n\n3. Identify the costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole:\n   - This would be \"Administrative Expenses\".\n   - The amount for \"Administrative Expenses\" is 1597051.08.\n\nMaintaining order as in the input:\n\n- value1: \"Main Business Revenue\" -> 8361807.77\n- value2: \"Cost of Goods Sold\" -> 6720000.00\n- value3: \"Administrative Expenses\" -> 1597051.08\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"8361807.77\", \"value2\": \"6720000.00\", \"value3\": \"1597051.08\"} }\n```",
