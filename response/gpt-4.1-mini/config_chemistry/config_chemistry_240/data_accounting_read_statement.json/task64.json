                        "content": "Let's analyze the problem carefully to extract the required three values:\n\n**Requested values:**\n\n1. A value from Balance Sheet: **capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**  \n   - This is typically represented by **Paid-in Capital**.\n\n2. A value from Income Statement: **the end value of profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**  \n   - This is the **Profit Before Tax** line.\n\n3. A value from Balance Sheet or Cash Flow Statement related to: **the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**  \n   - This normally corresponds to **Accounts Payable (increase)**, and the increase in this amount is seen on balance sheet by the difference in Accounts Payable or in the cash flow statement as Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\n   - Since the instruction is to group outputs by financial statement and to preserve order, and in the example the payable increase was taken from Balance Sheet (Accounts Payable), we will extract this from the **Balance Sheet**.\n\n----\n\n### Step 1: Extract from Balance Sheet:\n- Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares = **Paid-in Capital**:\n  - End amount: 13000000.00\n\n- Increase in amount owed by entity for goods/services on credit (Accounts Payable):\n  - Initial amount: 0.00\n  - End amount: 3010000.00\n  - Increase = 3010000.00 (since initial is zero)\n\n### Step 2: Extract from Income Statement:\n- End value of profit or loss for period before tax = **Profit Before Tax**: -923950.35\n\n----\n\n### Final Output:\n\n- Balance Sheet values in order:  \n  1) Paid-in Capital = 13000000.00  \n  2) Accounts Payable (increase) = 3010000.00\n\n- Income Statement value:  \n  Profit Before Tax = -923950.35  \n\nThere is no required value from Cash Flow Statement for this task based on instructions; the requested 3 values are from balance sheet and income statement only.\n\n----\n\n### Format output accordingly:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"13000000.00\", \"value2\": \"-923950.35\", \"value3\": \"3010000.00\"}}\n```\n\n----\n\n**Note:** The example given used as value2 = 'Profit Before Tax' from income statement, value1 = Paid-in Capital from balance sheet, and value3 = increase in Accounts Payable from balance sheet or cash flow statement (in example it was balance sheet). Here too we proceed the same.",
