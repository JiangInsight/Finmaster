These are typically **non-current assets**, such as fixed assets, property, plant, and equipment.\n\nFrom the balance sheet data provided:\n\n- Current assets typically include: Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, and Total Current Assets.\n- Non-current assets typically include: Fixed Assets, Accumulated Depreciation (a contra account that reduces fixed assets), and Total Non-current Assets.\n- Total Assets is the sum of Current Assets and Non-current Assets.\n\nSince we are asked for total assets that are **not expected to be realized or consumed in the normal operating cycle**, this corresponds to the **Total Non-current Assets** line.\n\nChecking the values:\n\n- Initial Total Non-current Assets: 5,000,000.00 (2023-12-31)\n- End Total Non-current Assets: 6,547,452.63 (2024-01-28)\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"5000000.00\", \"end value\": \"6547452.63\"}}\n```",
