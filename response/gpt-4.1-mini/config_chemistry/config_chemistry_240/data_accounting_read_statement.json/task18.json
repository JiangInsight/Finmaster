Cash held by an entity available for use in day-to-day operations:\n   - Cash on Hand (initial and end values)\n   - Bank Deposits (initial and end values)\n\n2. Tangible items held for use in production, supply of goods/services, for rental, or administrative purposes:\n   - Fixed Assets (initial and end values)\n\n3. Amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid (taxes payable):\n   - Taxes Payable (initial and end values)\n\nStep 2: Extract the values maintaining the original line item order as shown.\n\nThe order from the problem is:\n- Cash on Hand\n- Bank Deposits\n- ... (Other line items)\n- Fixed Assets\n- ...\n- Taxes Payable\n\nBut the example solution format shows extracting three line items and values as value1, value2, value3 in that order.\n\nReferring to the example, the first value corresponds to cash available for day-to-day operations (which appears to be represented by \"Cash on Hand\" only), the second value corresponds to fixed assets, and the third value corresponds to taxes payable.\n\nIn the example, both Cash on Hand and Bank Deposits are mentioned, but the example solution took only cash on hand for value1, fixed assets for value2, and taxes payable for value3.\n\nSince the task says \"Based on the balance sheet, identify and extract the three specific line items and value of cash held by an entity\", i.e., single line for cash held (not multiple), we take \"Cash on Hand\".\n\nTherefore, extract as:\n\n- initial value1 = Cash on Hand initial amount: 3000000.00\n- end valu1 = Cash on Hand end amount: 1379124.39\n\n- initial value2 = Fixed Assets initial amount: 5000000.00\n- end valu2 = Fixed Assets end amount: 6593203.67\n\n- initial value3 = Taxes Payable initial amount: 0.00\n- end valu3 = Taxes Payable end amount: 418090.41\n\nStep 3: Prepare the solution JSON accordingly.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value1\": \"3000000.00\", \"end valu1\": \"1379124.39\", \"initial value2\": \"5000000.00\", \"end valu2\": \"6593203.67\", \"initial value3\": \"0.00\", \"end valu3\": \"418090.41\"}}\n```",
