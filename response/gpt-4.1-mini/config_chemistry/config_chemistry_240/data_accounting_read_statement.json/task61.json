Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services to customers\n  2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets\n\nCheck each statement for relevant values:\n\n---\n\n### Balance Sheet\nNo line item explicitly describes costs to secure or deliver customer orders or payments to acquire assets. Balance sheet mostly lists asset and liability positions.  \nSo, no relevant values here.\n\n---\n\n### Income Statement\n- \"Selling Expenses\" is typically related to costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services (e.g. marketing, distribution, sales costs).  \n- \"Selling Expenses\" = 404114.07\n\n- Cash payments to acquire property, plant, equipment would not appear here, since income statement is about revenue and expense, not cash flow or purchases.\n\n---\n\n### Cash Flow Statement\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" represents cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.  \n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = 1593203.67\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services: Selling Expenses = 404114.07  \n- Cash payments to acquire property, plant, equipment, and other long-term assets: Purchase of Fixed Assets = 1593203.67\n\n---\n\n### Output format (grouped by financial statement in the order specified):\n\n1. Balance Sheet: none relevant  \n2. Income Statement: Selling Expenses = 404114.07  \n3. Cash Flow Statement: Purchase of Fixed Assets = 1593203.67\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"404114.07\", \"value2\": \"1593203.67\"}}\n```",
