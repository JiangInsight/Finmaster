However, since the problem specifically wants the reduction in assets held for sale or in production, the negative sign means inventory increased.\n\nBut since the original example selects the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" line item as the reduction value (though negative), we follow the same approach.\n\nHence, the value to extract is \"-4530000.00\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-4530000.00\"}}\n```",
