From the cash flow statement, the relevant line item representing tax accrued but not yet paid would typically be labeled something like \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" or \"Increase (Decrease) in Taxes Payable\".\n2. In the provided problem, the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" has the amount 418090.41, dated 2024-01-28.\n3. This value represents the increase in amounts of tax accrued but not paid.\n\nTherefore, the correct value to extract is 418090.41.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '418090.41'} }\n```",
