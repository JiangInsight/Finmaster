Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{-4,900,875.61}{-1,342,040.76} = 3.65\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\nUsually, this ratio is defined as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Asset Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}}\n\\]\n\nSince only ending current assets is provided, we will use the ending current assets:\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{8,361,807.77}{8,538,597.02} = 0.98\n\\]\n\n(If initial current assets were used, it was 8,000,000. Using average: (8,000,000 + 8,538,597.02) / 2 = 8,269,298.51\n\nUsing average:\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{8,361,807.77}{8,269,298.51} = 1.01\n\\]\n\nWe will use average since it is more accurate.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Quick Ratio\n\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{8,538,597.02 - 4,530,000.00}{3,428,090.41} = \\frac{4,008,597.02}{3,428,090.41} = 1.17\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final answers:\n\n- Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: 3.65 (rounded to two decimals)\n- Current Assets Turnover Ratio: 1.01 (rounded to two decimals)\n- Quick Ratio: 1.17 (rounded to two decimals)\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"3.65\", \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"1.01\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.17\"} }\n```",
