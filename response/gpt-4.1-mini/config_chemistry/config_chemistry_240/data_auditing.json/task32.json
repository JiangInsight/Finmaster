original should be +16.43.  \n- \"Interest receivable\" is misspelled as \"interest receviable\" in receive_method.  \n- No other fields contradicting; thus original amount and spelling should be accepted.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Interest Receivables\", \"Recorded category\": \"Interest Receivables\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-28\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-28\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Original payment_method\": \"\", \"Recorded payment_method\": \"\", \"Original quantity\": \"\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"\", \"Original price\": \"\", \"Recorded price\": \"\", \"Original receive_method\": \"Interest receivable\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Interest receviable\", \"Original amount\": \"270.56\", \"Recorded amount\": \"-56.55\", \"Original tax\": \"\", \"Recorded tax\": \"\", \"Original profit\": \"\", \"Recorded profit\": \"\", \"Original Preparer\": \"\", \"Recorded Preparer\": \"\", \"Original Approver\": \"\", \"Recorded Approver\": \"\", \"id\": \"Interest20240128028\"}}\n```\n\nExplanation:  \n- The interest receivable amount should be positive 270.56, not negative -56.55.  \n- \"Interest receivable\" misspelled in receive_method again.  \n- Recorded negative amount is an error.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Interest Receivables\", \"Recorded category\": \"Interest Receivables\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-10\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-10\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Original payment_method\": \"\", \"Recorded payment_method\": \"\", \"Original quantity\": \"\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"\", \"Original price\": \"\", \"Recorded price\": \"\", \"Original receive_method\": \"Interest receivable\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Interest receviable\", \"Original amount\": \"348.88\", \"Recorded amount\": \"-54.77\", \"Original tax\": \"\", \"Recorded tax\": \"\", \"Original profit\": \"\", \"Recorded profit\": \"\", \"Original Preparer\": \"\", \"Recorded Preparer\": \"\", \"Original Approver\": \"\", \"Recorded Approver\": \"\", \"id\": \"Interest20240110010\"}}\n```\n\nExplanation:  \n- Interest amount -54.77 is unlikely correct.
