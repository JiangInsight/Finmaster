However, the recorded payment/receipt_status is \"Unpaid\" which matches the problem.\n- The only inconsistency is in the recorded payment method field: Previous examples usually list payment methods as \"Bank Transfer\", \"Cash\" etc. Here payment method is \"Account Payable\", but in source it is \"Account Payable\" so it is consistent.\n- But re-check reveals the initial recorded_payment_method field is \"Account Payable\" but the actual payment_method in the problem description says \"account payable\" which is consistent.\n- The problem is the recorded_amount field is 800000.0 for 16 units at 50000 per unit. 16 * 50000 = 800000, so amount matches.\n- So no inconsistency detected in this row besides capitalization.\n- However, reviewing the other lines, we find that in this dataset the \"recorded_payment_method\" sometimes is formatted as \"Bank Transfer\", sometimes as \"Account Payable\" â€” this may be fine.\n- The row is consistent except that the \"recorded_payment_method\" value should be \"Account Payable\" (correct).\n- No inconsistencies found in that row.\n- Check other rows flagged by the original examples:\n\nThe one clear inconsistency is the record with ID \"Sale20240103006\", which in this problem is recorded as \"Depreciation\" but actually a Sale:\n\n- ID: Sale20240103006\n- Recorded category: \"Depreciation\"\n- Correct category: \"Sale\"\n- Recorded unit price: 65397.19\n- Original unit price (from description): 61521.65\n\nThus, output that inconsistency as well.\n\nTherefore the inconsistencies found are:\n\n1) Sale20240103006:\n   - recorded_type is \"Depreciation\" but should be \"Sale\"\n   - recorded_unit_price recorded as 65397.19 but should be 61521.65\n\n2) Sale20240105008:\n   - recorded_type is \"Depreciation\" but should be \"Sale\"\n   - recorded_unit_price recorded as 28915.95 but should be 24545.58\n\n3) Interest receivable transactions with negative recorded_amounts are also inconsistent as interest receivable amounts should not be negative. Examples:\n\n- Interest20240110010: recorded_amount -54.77, should be positive 54.77\n- Interest20240111011: recorded_amount -19.17, should be positive 19.17\n- Interest20240127027: recorded_amount -92.15, should be positive 92.15\n- Interest20240123023: recorded_amount -7.84, should be positive 7.84\n- Interest20240124024: recorded_amount -16.74, should be positive 16.74\n- Interest20240128028: recorded_amount -56.55, should be positive 56.55\n\nWill include these.\n\nAccordingly structured output for all inconsistencies found:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240103006\",\n    \"incorrect_fields\": [\"recorded_type\", \"recorded_unit_price\"],\n    \"recorded_values\": [\"Depreciation\", 65397.19],\n    \"correct_values\": [\"Sale\", 61521.65]\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\":
