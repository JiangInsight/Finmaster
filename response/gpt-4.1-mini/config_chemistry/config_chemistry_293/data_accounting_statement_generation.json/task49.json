The cash flow from operating activities uses adjustments per typical indirect method: start from net profit, add depreciation, adjust working capital changes (accounts receivable, interest receivable, inventory, accounts payable), factor in no tax payable changes reported.\n\nThis provides a standard cash flow statement with necessary details from provided transactions.",
