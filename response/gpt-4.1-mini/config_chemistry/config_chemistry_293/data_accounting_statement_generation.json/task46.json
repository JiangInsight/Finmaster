                        "content": "To calculate the final beginning cash and cash equivalents balance, we need to consider the initial balances of cash and bank deposits as starting point and then account for all cash inflows and outflows. However, since the task is to determine the \"final beginning cash and cash equivalents balance,\" typically this means the cash and cash equivalents at the start date of the period, which from the data appears to be 2023-12-31.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify initial cash and cash equivalents balances on 2023-12-31\n\nFrom the problem data, the initial entries on 2023-12-31:\n\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n\nTotal initial cash and cash equivalents = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000\n\nThe Fixed Assets initial amount is 5,000,000 but it is **not** cash or cash equivalents.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Check if the problem expects adjustments for transactions after 2023-12-31\n\nThe problem is to find the \"final beginning cash and cash equivalents balance\" in the cash flow statement. Usually, this starting balance is as of the beginning of the period (e.g., 2024-01-01), which equals the ending balance of prior period (2023-12-31). Since the initial deposits represent the initial cash and bank balances, we take them as the beginning balance.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe beginning balance of cash and cash equivalents is the sum of initial cash and bank deposits:\n\n**8,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\"}}\n```",
