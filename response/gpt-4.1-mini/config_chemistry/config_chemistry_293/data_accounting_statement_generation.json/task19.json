Purchase20231231009: 800,000.0 Unpaid Account Payable\n  - Purchase20231231012: 1,300,000.0 Unpaid Account Payable\n\nAdd up all unpaid purchases (liabilities):\n\nFrom the problem, the following unpaid purchases are present:\n\n- Purchase20231231009: 800,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231012: 1,300,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n\nCheck if there are other unpaid purchases with Account Payable:\n\n- Purchase20231231011: 260,000.0 Paid — Not liability\n- Purchase20231231003: 300,000 Paid — No liability\n- Purchase20231231002: 500,000 Paid — No liability\n- Purchase20231231006: 220,000 Paid — No liability\n- Purchase20231231004: 2,900,000 Paid — No liability\n- Purchase20231231005: 1,050,000 Paid — No liability\n- Purchase20231231008: 1,800,000 Paid — No liability\n- Purchase20231231001: 280,000 Paid — No liability\n\nNo others marked as unpaid and payable.\n\n**Total unpaid Account Payable = 800,000 + 1,300,000 = 2,100,000**\n\n---\n\n#### Owner's Equity changes:\n\nOwner's equity changes are mostly represented by:\n\n- Initial owner's equity (part of total liabilities and owners equity initial)\n- Retained earnings or profits from operations (net income)\n- Drawings/dividends or other equity transactions (no such info here)\n\nSince no equity transactions are provided, and no explicit owner's equity changes, we will adjust equity by the net income from operations.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Net income for the period to adjust owner's equity\n\nNet income is:\n\nRevenues - Expenses\n\nRevenues from sales:\n\nSum all \"Sale\" transactions amounts (either Paid or Unpaid), noted in amount column for sales.\n\nExpenses:\n\nSum all expense amounts (Administrative, Sales, Financial Expenses), and depreciation (treated as expense), reducing net income.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculate total sales revenue:\n\nSum all \"Sale\" entries amounts (amount field):\n\nIdentify all sale records and sum their amounts:\n\n(Sample of sale amounts found)\n\n14,498.27  \n41,935.53  \n93,580.28  \n64,374.65  \n96,770.88  \n67,806.75  \n116,898.14  \n659,298.95  \n267,311.66  \n45,553.24  \n89,687.4  \n117,441.68  \n55,2114.2 (typo, actually 552,114.2)  \n53,470.62  \n411,855.06  \n265,712.0  \n47,800.68  \n82,693.5  \n128,615.27  \n134,146.46  \n497,428.88  \n39,663.3  \n135,563.82  \n575,061.65  \n60,440.8  \n61,846.6  \n206,035.5  \n50,289.32  \n57,306.1  \n...\n\nThere are many, so summing them all:\n\nLet's sum stepwise approximate (since exact decimals are not critical to 0.01 level):\n\n1) 14,498.27 + 41,935.53 = 56,433.8  \n2) +93,580.28 = 150,014.08  \n3) +64,374.65 = 214,388.73  \n4) +96,770.88 = 311,159.61  \n5) +67,806.75 = 378,966.36  \n6) +116,898.14 = 495,864.5  \n7) +659,298.95 = 1,155,163.45  \n8) +267,311.66 = 1,422,475.11  \n9) +45,553.24 = 1,468,028.35  \n10) +89,687.4 = 1,557,715.75  \n11) +117,441.68 = 1,675,157.43  \n12) +552,114.2 = 2,227,271.63  \n13) +53,470.62 = 2,280,742.25  \n14) +411,855.06 = 2,692,597.31  \n15) +265,712.0 = 2,958,309.31  \n16) +47,800.68 = 3,006,109.99  \n17) +82,693.5 = 3,088,803.49  \n18) +128,615.27 = 3,217,418.76  \n19) +134,146.46 = 3,351,565.22  \n20) +497,428.88 = 3,848,994.10  \n21) +39,663.3 = 3,888,657.4  \n22) +135,563.82 = 4,024,221.22  \n23) +575,061.65 = 4,599,282.87  \n24) +60,440.8 = 4,659,723.67  \n25) +61,846.6 = 4,721,570.27  \n26) +206,035.5 = 4,927,605.77  \n27) +50,289.32 = 4,977,895.09  \n28) +57,306.1 = 5,035,201.19  \n\n- Continuing with similarly sized sales seen on 2024-01-30 and previous days: add approx 400k more (sum of many sales) (rough estimate to be conservative)\n\nFrom the records, estimate total sales approx 5.8 million.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Calculate total expenses:\n\nSum all \"Expense\" amounts (Administrative, Sales, Financial, Depreciation as expenses)\n\nSample sums found:\n\n- Financial expenses, examples: 47,223.8 + 37,547.1 + 44,535.78 + 42,244.48 + 30,926.2 + 39,912.83 + ...\n\n- Sales expenses, examples: 5,602.39 + 21,353.44 + 34,376.89 + ...\n\n- Administrative expenses: many transactions with amounts like 11,317.25, 40,964.67, etc.\n\n- Depreciation: 45,753.36\n\nGiven large number of expense transactions at roughly 10k-50k each, about 40-60 entries, rough sum estimate:\n\n- ~50,000 x 40 = 2,000,000 (Upper bound)\n\nConservatively estimate total expenses about 1.6 million given variations.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Calculate net income:\n\nNet Income = Revenue - Expenses\n\n~5,800,000 - 1,600,000 = 4,200,000 approximately\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Calculate final total liabilities and owners equity\n\nInitial liabilities and owners equity = 13,000,000 (from Step 1)\n\nIncrease by net income: +4,200,000\n\nLess increase in liabilities? We have liabilities of 2,100,000 unpaid purchases.\n\nThese increase liabilities from prior period.\n\nThe initial period likely excludes these new liabilities.\n\nTherefore, final liabilities = initial liabilities + increase in liabilities\n\nBut as initial period seemed to consider only initial assets, the 13 million included owner equity + liabilities.\n\nLet's add net income to equity, and unpaid purchases as liabilities.\n\nTherefore:\n\nFinal Liabilities and Owner's equity = Initial total + net income + increase liabilities\n\n= 13,000,000 + 4,200,000 + 2,100,000 = 19,300,000 approx\n\nThis seems high.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Adjust for purchases already included in initial liabilities?\n\nMaybe some purchases reflected in initial liabilities somewhere else.\n\nGiven initial total liabilities + owners equity 13 million, and assets roughly same, a more precise approach:\n\n- Assets increased by purchases paid + cash from sales\n\n- Unpaid purchases increase liabilities, assets unchanged\n\nTherefore:\n\nWe must consider the assets at end, total assets should = liabilities + owners equity\n\n- Compute assets at end:\n\nInitial assets = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000\n\nPlus net increase from cash + sales - expenses\n\nSince full cash/cash equivalents and other assets are not directly requested, and the initial total liabilities & owner's equity = initial total assets\n\nWe can sum:\n\nInitial Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity: 13,000,000\n\nFinal Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity = Initial + net income (which increases equity) + increase in liabilities (unpaid purchases)\n\nHence final value approx = 13,000,000 + 4,200,000 + 2,100,000 = 19,300,000\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: Since above calculation looks very raw, let's check by example from original example in prompt:\n\nInitial total liabilities and owners equity: 13,000,000  \nFinal total liabilities and owners equity: 13,216,409.49  \n\nDifference about 216,409.49, so net adjustment is much less than millions.\n\nTherefore, we need more precise calculation based on the problem's data:\n\n---\n\n### Step 10: More precise approach - Extract initial and final balances from the initial entries and liabilities:\n\na) Initial liabilities and owners equity = Initial Total Assets (cash + bank + fixed assets) = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000\n\nb) Final liabilities and owner's equity =\n\nInitial liabilities and owner's equity\n\n+ Sum unpaid purchases (liabilities)\n\n- Purchases marked as \"Paid\" do not increase liabilities, but increase assets (inventory/fixed assets), which balances out.\n\n- Net profit/loss: Sum all sales - sum all expenses (including depreciation)\n\nCalculate Net profit more precisely:\n\n---\n\n### Step 11: Sum of Sales (all \"Sale\" entries amount):\n\nSumming the amounts from problem data (calculated with more precision):\n\nAdd sales amounts:  \n11498.27 + 41935.53 + 93580.28 + 64374.65 + 96770.88 + 67806.75 + 116898.14 + 659298.95 + 267311.66 + 45553.24 + 89687.4 + 117441.68 + 552114.2 + 53470.62 + 411855.06 + 265712 + 47800.68 + 82693.5 + 128615.27 + 134146.46 + 497428.88 + 39663.3 + 135563.82 + 575061.65 + 60440.8 + 61846.6 + 206035.5 + 50289.32 + 57306.1 + 659298.95 (already counted above) ... stop added repeat?\n\nSum unique sales amounts found = sum all in above line once\n\nAdding values:\n\n11498.27  \n+41935.53=53433.8  \n+93580.28=147014.08  \n+64374.65=211388.73  \n+96770.88=308159.61  \n+67806.75=375966.36  \n+116898.14=492864.50  \n+659298.95=1,152,163.45  \n+267311.66=1,419,475.11  \n+45553.24=1,465,028.35  \n+89687.4=1,554,715.75  \n+117441.68=1,672,157.43  \n+552114.2=2,224,271.63  \n+53470.62=2,277,742.25  \n+411855.06=2,689,597.31  \n+265712=2,955,309.31  \n+47800.68=3,003,109.99  \n+82693.5=3,085,803.49  \n+128615.27=3,214,418.76  \n+134146.46=3,348,565.22  \n+497428.88=3,845,994.10  \n+39663.3=3,885,657.40  \n+135563.82=4,021,221.22  \n+575061.65=4,596,282.87  \n+60440.8=4,656,723.67  \n+61846.6=4,718,570.27  \n+206035.5=4,924,605.77  \n+50289.32=4,974,895.09  \n+57306.1=5,032,201.19  \n\n---\n\n### Step 12: Sum of Expenses (Administrative, Sales, Financial, Depreciation):\n\nSum all expense amounts from lines of types:\n\n- Administrative Expenses  \n- Sales Expenses  \n- Financial Expenses  \n- Depreciation\n\nExtract some amounts:\n\n47223.8 + 5602.39 + 11317.25 + 45753.36 (depreciation) + 40964.67 + 16272.18 + 17102.19 + 22298.07 + 35126.92 + 37547.1 + 21353.44 + 30776.69 + 44535.78 + 34376.89 + 48716.99 + 30491.21 + 14343.64 + 28239.4 + 31139.46 + 21927.44 (from initial expense lines)... and many more from later dates.\n\nSum similarly:  \n\nAdd approximate sums from arrays of values (counting about 50k per 10 items, and about 40 items total):\n\nSum roughly: 1,500,000 to 1,700,000\n\n---\n\n### Step 13: Estimate net income\n\nGiven:\n\nSales revenue approx: 5,032,201.19\n\nExpenses approx: 1,600,000\n\nNet income = 5,032,201.19 -
