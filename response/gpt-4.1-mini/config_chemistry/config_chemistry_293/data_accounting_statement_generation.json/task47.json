(many more similar entries)\n\nGiven the large number and similar values, and that the example problem solution's ending balance is about 434,651.47 after starting from 8M and hundreds of sales and purchases,\n\nWe should try to approximate or do exact sum:\n\nInstead, let's do this logically:\n\n- Starting cash + bank deposits: 8,000,000\n- Plus cash receipts from sales: approx 5,743,975.26\n- Plus bank-to-cash transfers: 1,300,000  \nSum of cash inflows = 8,000,000 + 5,743,975.26 + 1,300,000 = 15,043,975.26\n\n- Cash outflows = cash purchases (6,270,000) + cash expenses (sum to be calculated)\n\nAssuming expenses roughly add up about 1,800,000 (expenses are mostly in tens of thousands, around 100 entries, roughly 18,000 * 100 = 1,800,000)\n\nSo total outflows approximately = 6,270,000 + 1,800,000 = 8,070,000\n\nEnding cash balance roughly = 15,043,975.26 - 8,070,000 = 6,973,975.26 (which is very high)\n\nThis is not consistent with the example ending balance of 434,651.47 which was for another dataset.\n\n---\n\nBut in the examples, the initial cash+bank was 8,000,000, they had purchases and expenses and assuming transfers and sales as above, the balances are lowered similarly.\n\n---\n\nSince the problem expects exact calculation, let's do precise sum for cash expenses:\n\nSum all Expenses with Payment Method = Cash and Payment Status = Paid:\n\nExtract all 'amount' for Expense rows where payment_method = Cash and paid:\n\nFrom the problem data:\n\n- Expense20240101001 Financial Expenses 47,223.8  \n- Expense20240101001 Sales Expenses 5,602.39  \n-
