Identify the initial paid-in capital:\n   - Typically, this includes initial capital contributions such as cash deposits, bank deposits, and fixed assets recorded at the start.\n   - From the problem, initial transactions with type \"Initial20231231001\" have these:\n     - Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n     - Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n     - Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.0\n   Summing these: 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.0\n\n2. Confirm if any new capital contributions or changes to capital occurred during the period:\n   - Reviewing the transaction types and amounts, no other entries represent additional paid-in capital contributions.\n   - Purchases, sales, expenses, and other entries do not affect paid-in capital.\n   - No entries indicate capital withdrawals or new injections.\n\nThus, the initial paid-in capital is 13,000,000.00 and since no changes occurred, the ending paid-in capital remains the same.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"13000000.00\"}}\n```",
