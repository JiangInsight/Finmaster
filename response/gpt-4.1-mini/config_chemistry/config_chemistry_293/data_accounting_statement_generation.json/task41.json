                        "content": "To calculate the Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable, we need to:\n\n1. Identify accounts payable transactions at the start date (initial) and at the end date.\n2. Sum purchases paid via \"Account Payable\" or marked \"Unpaid\" (i.e., liabilities incurred but not paid), or specifically identify the accounts payable amounts.\n3. Since the initial accounts payable is not explicitly provided in the initial records (only initial cash, bank, fixed assets), we should consider all purchases marked \"Unpaid\" or using \"Account Payable\" as the ending accounts payable balance.\n4. The difference between ending and beginning accounts payable is the increase (decrease) in accounts payable.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n\n- Initial balances have no explicit accounts payable amount.\n- We locate all Purchase transactions with \"payment/receipt_status\" = \"Unpaid\" or with \"payment_method\" = \"Account Payable\".\n\nLooking into purchases:\n\nHere are all relevant Purchase records with Unpaid or Account Payable status:\n\n- Purchase20231231009: Purchase, Unpaid, amount 800,000.0, payment_method is \"Account Payable\"\n- Purchase20231231012: Purchase, Unpaid, amount 1,300,000.0, payment_method is \"Account Payable\"\n- Purchase20231231009 from supplier table repeated only once\n- Purchase20231231010 and others are mostly Paid\n- Purchase20231231009 and Purchase20231231012 are the unpaid purchases, thus accounts payable.\n\nAdd these unpaid purchases amounts to get accounts payable:\n\n- 800,000.0 (Purchase20231231009)\n- 1,300,000.0 (Purchase20231231012)\n\nSum = 800,000 + 1,300,000 = 2,100,000\n\nStarting accounts payable is zero (no initial accounts payable balance given).\n\nHence, Increase in Accounts Payable = Ending AP - Beginning AP = 2,100,000 - 0 = 2,100,000.00\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"2100000.00\"}}\n```",
