So, beginning balance is assumed to be zero unless specified otherwise in the data.\n\n**Step 2: Identify ending accounts receivable balance (for the last recorded date, presumably 2024-01-30).**  \nLook for all sales marked as \"Unpaid\" with \"Account Receviable\" or \"Account Receivable\" as receive method on or before the last date in the data.\n\nFrom the dataset, the relevant sales on or before 2024-01-30 with status \"Unpaid\" and receive method \"Account Receviable\" or \"Account Receivable\" (despite typos) are:\n\n- 2024-01-02: 41935.53 (Sale20240102003)\n- 2024-01-04: 64374.65 (Sale20240104005)\n- 2024-01-10: 470550.84 (Sale20240110016)\n- 2024-01-12: 23652.08 (Sale20240112021)\n- 2024-01-13: 44428.82 (Sale20240113023)\n- 2024-01-14: 620407.25 (Sale20240114027) – but status is Paid for 620407.25, account receivable on smaller sale?
