Transaction ID `Purchase20231231002` has recorded quantity 25 and unit price 20000, which leads to amount 500000, but the recorded amount is 500000, so that's consistent.\n\n2. The original record showed it as 30 units and amount 1500000, supplier S002 Supplier 2. The new record shows 25 units, 500000, supplier S007 Supplier 7. This is a inconsistency.\n\n3. The most reliable fields are the invoice and amounts; as the invoice and the total amount are consistent with 25 units * 20000 = 500000, the recorded quantity and amount are presumably correct.\n\n4. Hence, correcting quantity to 25 units, and amount to 500000, supplier to S007 Supplier 7.\n\n5. All other fields seem consistent, so final corrected values are as above.",
