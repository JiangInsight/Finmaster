The row states 25 units but recorded_quantity is missing in input but should be 25 (assuming from the invoice note).  \n- Supplier ID is S007, supplier name is Supplier 7.  \n- Original data shows 25 units at 20000 equals 500000, this matches recorded_amount so no inconsistency here.  \n- In the problem data, this entry had 30 units and 1500000 amount, which is inconsistent with the line price and quantity, but in this problem input it uses 25 units, 20000 unit price, and 500000 correctly matching.  \n- So nothing inconsistent in current record.  \n  \nNo other inconsistency found in the given data snippet involving Purchase20231231002.  \n\nIf more inconsistencies found, each would be reported likewise. But only one entry from the given data is found inconsistent in the original example, and here the provided data appears consistent.  \n\nHence only outputting corrected consistent data for the problematic entry.",
