The recorded unit price should match the invoice unit price `$10000.00`.\n- The payment method is recorded as \"Bank Transfer\" and status \"Paid\", but invoice text shows unpaid and payment method as \"account payable\".\n- The quantity is consistent (28), so no correction needed there.\n\nHence the fields with inconsistencies are date, payment/receipt status, payment method, and unit price. The correct values are derived from invoice and description as above. Other fields match correctly.",
