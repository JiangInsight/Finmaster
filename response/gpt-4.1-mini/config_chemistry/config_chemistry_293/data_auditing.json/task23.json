However, in the original example, the quantity was 29 units and total 290,000. Given unit price fixed at 10,000, the amount should be quantity * unit price = 28 * 10,000 = 280,000 (matches recorded), so recorded is consistent quantity-amount wise internally.\n\n- But payment method is recorded as \"Bank Transfer\" and payment status as \"Paid\", while the original example had account payable and \"Unpaid\", indicating inconsistency.\n\n- Supplier ID changed from S002 to S006, supplier name from Supplier 2 to Supplier 6, indicating possible error.\n\n- The invoice narrative says 29 units, 290,000, account payable, unpaid, prepared by Staff, approved by Director; the recorded data differs in qty, amount, payment method/status, preparer, and supplier.\n\n- Due to invoice and other rows, the original values more likely correct in payment terms and quantity (29, 290,000, account payable, unpaid), so recorded fields are inconsistent.\n\nThus, output the main inconsistent fields with their recorded and best estimated correct values from the original.",
