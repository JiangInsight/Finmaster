I will choose the first occurrence, \"Main Business Revenue\".\n- Carrying amount of inventories sold: \"Cost of Goods Sold\": 6,290,000.00  \n- Costs of general management and administration: \"Administrative Expenses\": 1,335,153.59\n\nMaintaining the original order in input:\n\n1. Main Business Revenue: 7825951.24  \n2. Cost of Goods Sold: 6290000.00  \n3. Administrative Expenses: 1335153.59\n\nHence the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"7825951.24\", \"value2\": \"6290000.00\", \"value3\": \"1335153.59\"} }\n```\n",
