Identify the three specific items requested:\n   - The end value of profit or loss for a period **before deducting tax expense**: This corresponds to \"Profit Before Tax\" on the Income Statement.\n   - The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period: This corresponds to the increase in \"Accounts Payable\" on the Balance Sheet.\n   - Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares: This corresponds to \"Paid-in Capital\" on the Balance Sheet.\n   \n2. Extract values from the provided financial statements:\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n- Paid-in Capital End_amount = 13000000.00\n- Accounts Payable End_amount = 2100000.00\n\n**Income Statement:**\n- Profit Before Tax Amount = -1010139.34\n\n*Note:* For the increase in amount owed (Accounts Payable), since the initial amount is 0.00 and the end amount is 2100000.00, the addition is 2100000.00.\n\n3. Put the values in the required order and format:\n\n- value1: Capital contributed by shareholders = Paid-in Capital = 13000000.00\n- value2: Profit or loss before tax = Profit Before Tax = -1010139.34\n- value3: Addition in amount owed = Accounts Payable increase = 2100000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"13000000.00\", \"value2\": \"-1010139.34\", \"value3\": \"2100000.00\"}}\n```",
