The question asks for the total assets that are **not expected to be realised or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle**. This typically refers to **non-current assets** which generally include fixed assets.\n\n2. From the balance sheet given, the line items that are non-current assets are:\n   - Fixed Assets: Initial_amount = 5,000,000.00 and End_amount = 5,324,677.57\n   - Accumulated Depreciation (contra asset, but excluded because it's a reduction)\n   - Total Non-current Assets: Initial_amount = 5,000,000.00 and End_amount = 5,278,924.21\n\n3. The total non-current assets figure sums up the values net of accumulated depreciation. So the best figure representing non-current assets (not expected to be realised or sold in normal operating cycle) is \"Total Non-current Assets.\"\n\n4. Therefore, the initial value is \"5,000,000.00\" and the end value is \"5,278,924.21\"\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"5000000.00\", \"end value\": \"5278924.21\"} }\n```",
