                        "content": "The task is to extract two specific values from the provided financial statements:\n\n1. The value of \"interest accrued but not yet received\" from the financial statements.\n2. The net addition (increase or decrease) in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\nWe must group the results by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Since the problem only asks for the two specific values, and the sample solution extracted the \"Interest Receivable\" value from either the balance sheet or the amount shown as \"Interest Income\" in the income statement (both the same amount), and the net increase of \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" from the cash flow statement.\n\n---\n\nStep 1: Identify the \"interest accrued but not yet received\"\n\n- In the Balance Sheet:  \n  \"Interest Receivable\" with an End_amount of 5758.38 at 2024-01-30\n\n- In the Income Statement:  \n  \"Interest Income\" of 5758.38 at 2024-01-30\n\nSince both balance sheet and income statement show the same amount for interest receivable/income, typically interest receivable is the amount accrued but not yet received (asset), so we will extract the \"Interest Receivable\" value from the Balance Sheet.\n\n---\n\nStep 2: Identify the net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\n- In the Cash Flow Statement under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section:\n\n  - Beginning Balance: 8,000,000.00  \n  - Ending Balance: 3,276,562.05  \n  - Net Increase: -4,723,437.95  \n\nThis shows that cash and cash equivalents decreased by 4,723,437.95\n\n---\n\nThus:\n\n- value1 = Interest Receivable (Balance Sheet) = 5758.38  \n- value2 = Net Increase (Cash and Cash Equivalents) = -4723437.95\n\nNote: The amounts are strings in the result as per the example.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"5758.38\", \"value2\": \"-4723437.95\"}}\n```",
