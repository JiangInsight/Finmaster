From the income statement given, this is typically represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) line item, since COGS reflects the cost value of the inventories that were sold to generate the revenue.\n\nIn the problem provided, the line \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is present with the amount 6290000.00.\n\nTherefore, the value of carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is 6290000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"6290000.00\"}}\n```",
