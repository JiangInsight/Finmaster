The task requires identifying and extracting the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities related to:\n   - Acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents\n   - Receipt of interest and dividends\n\n2. These items are usually found under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\"\n\n3. From the given data, under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" the only line item present is:\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 324,677.57\n\n4. The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is given as -324,677.57, which matches (negative of purchase amount), indicating cash outflow for acquisition.\n\n5. There is no mention of receipt of interest and dividends line items here or elsewhere in the statement.\n\n6. So the net cash and cash equivalents generated from these activities (acquisition & disposal of long-term assets + receipt of interest and dividends) is:\n   -324,677.57\n\n7. The one component sub-item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with value 324,677.57 (positive, since it is an outflow, the net amount is negative).\n\n8. Following the format, report:\n   - 'value' = '-324677.57' (net cash flow from investing activities)\n   - 'sub_items_sub_item value' = '324677.57' (corresponding purchase of fixed assets)\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-324677.57\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"324677.57\"} }\n```",
