The profit an entity retains after all expenses (operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) is typically represented by the \"Net Profit\" line item in the cash flow statement.\n\n2. The cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets are represented by \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" under the investing activities section.\n\n3. From the problem's statement, we need to extract these two line items and their amount values.\n\n4. Looking at the problem statement's table:\n   - Net Profit: -1401436.89\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 324677.57\n\nRespecting the order as shown in the statement, the first value is the Net Profit and the second is the Purchase of Fixed Assets value.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"-1401436.89\", \"value2\": \"324677.57\"} }\n```",
