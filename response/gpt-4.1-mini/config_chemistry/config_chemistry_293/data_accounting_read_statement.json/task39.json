The typical line item that captures changes in assets held for sale or in production for sale is usually labeled as \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" or a similar phrase.\n2. From the problem data, the item \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" has the amount **-3540000.00**.\n3. A negative value here means an increase in inventory (assets held for sale or in production), while a positive value would mean a reduction.\n4. However, the task is to extract the **reduction** in the amount of assets held for sale. A reduction is a positive cash flow adjustment, meaning inventory decreased.\n5. Despite the negative sign, this is the only relevant line to \"assets held for sale\".\n6. So the value of the reduction is recorded as **-3540000.00** (meaning inventory increased by 3,540,000, a reduction would be positive).\n\nSince the task is to identify the reduction (which is a decrease in inventory), the number to extract from the statement is the value of the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\", which here is **-3540000.00** (meaning inventory increased, i.e., no reduction occurred, but this is the relevant line item and its amount).\n\nHence, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-3540000.00\"}}\n```",
