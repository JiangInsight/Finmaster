Review the balance sheet for relevant line items related to shareholders' capital or capital contributed.\n2. The key line item is \"Paid-in Capital,\" which typically represents the capital contributed by shareholders.\n3. From the balance sheet:\n   - Initial_amount for Paid-in Capital: 13000000.00 \n   - End_amount for Paid-in Capital: 13000000.00\n\nThese represent the capital contributed by shareholders at the beginning and end of the period.\n\nNo other line item explicitly represents capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares.\n\nThus:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"13000000.00\", \"end value\": \"13000000.00\"}}\n```\n\nThis matches the representation required.",
