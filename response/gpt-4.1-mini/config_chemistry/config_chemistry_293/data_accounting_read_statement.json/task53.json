The carrying amount of inventories sold during the period is represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) in the income statement. This reflects the cost of inventory that has been sold.\n\n2. From the income statement:\n   - Cost of Goods Sold = 6,290,000.00\n\n3. Therefore, the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is 6,290,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"6290000.00\"}}\n```",
