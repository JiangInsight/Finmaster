The four specific line items we need to extract are:\n   - Systematic allocation of depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life → typically labeled as **\"Depreciation\"**\n   - Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured → **\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\"**\n   - Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and receipt of interest and dividends → **\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\"**\n   - Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period → **\"Net Increase\"**\n\n2. From the given data:\n\n| Account                              | Amount       |\n|------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Depreciation                       | 45753.36     |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory   | -3540000.00  |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities | -324677.57   |\n| Net Increase                      | -4723437.95  |\n\n3.
