                        "content": "The task is to identify the costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services. These costs are usually reflected in \"Selling Expenses\" (costs related to sales activities, marketing, and customer order acquisition) and \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (direct costs related to producing/delivering the goods or services).\n\nFrom the income statement provided:\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 6,290,000.00\n- Selling Expenses: 627,729.56\n\nCosts to secure orders: Selling Expenses  \nCosts to deliver goods/services: Cost of Goods Sold\n\nThe question asks for the specific line items and value of these costs. The example answer format only includes the value corresponding to these costs. Since the prior example extracted only the \"Selling Expenses\" (costs to secure orders), but the problem states \"costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services,\" logically both these line items apply.\n\nHowever, the example solution provided extracted only the Selling Expenses value for the \"costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services to customers\" (which presumably excludes COGS). Given that, I should follow the same logic and extract Selling Expenses.\n\nHence, the answer is the value of Selling Expenses: 627729.56\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"627729.56\"}}\n```",
