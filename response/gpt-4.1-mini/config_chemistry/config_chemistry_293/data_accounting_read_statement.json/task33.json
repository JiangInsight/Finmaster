The value of income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities.\n2. The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n- The \"income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities\" generally corresponds to the main business revenue. In the given income statement, this is labeled as **\"Main Business Revenue\"**.\n  \n- The \"carrying amount of inventories sold\" corresponds to the cost associated with those inventories, generally shown as **\"Cost of Goods Sold\"**.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n| Account             | Amount      | Date       |\n|---------------------|-------------|------------|\n| Main Business Revenue| 7825951.24  | 2024-01-30 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold   | 6290000.00  | 2024-01-30 |\n\nSo we select in order:\n\n- value1 = Main Business Revenue = 7825951.24\n- value2 = Cost of Goods Sold = 6290000.00\n\nHence,\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '7825951.24', 'value2': '6290000.00'}}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '7825951.24', 'value2': '6290000.00'}}\n```",
