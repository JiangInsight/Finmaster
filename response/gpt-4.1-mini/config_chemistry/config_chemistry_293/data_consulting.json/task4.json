Here, we only have Total Current Liabilities provided, and no explicit long-term liabilities mentioned, so we consider Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities.\n- Total Owner's Equity is given.\n\nFrom the problem data as of 2024-01-30:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\n- Total Owner's Equity = 11,598,563.11\n\nCalculate:\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 2,491,297.55 / 11,598,563.11 â‰ˆ 0.2148\n\nRounded to two decimal places: 0.21\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.21\"} }\n```",
