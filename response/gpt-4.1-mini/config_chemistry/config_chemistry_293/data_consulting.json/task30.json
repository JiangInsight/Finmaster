No long term debt is shown; assume total debt = total current liabilities = 2,491,297.55 (since no other liabilities listed).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the ratios\n\n---\n\n#### Current Ratio  \n= Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \n= 8,810,936.45 / 2,491,297.55 ≈ 3.54\n\n---\n\n#### Quick Ratio  \nQuick Assets = Cash and Equivalents + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable  \n= (Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits) + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable  \n= (1,753,673.43 + 1,522,888.62) + 5,758.38 + 1,988,616.02  \n= 3,276,562.05 + 5,758.38 + 1,988,616.02 = 5,270,936.45  \n\nQuick Ratio = Quick Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \n= 5,270,936.45 / 2,491,297.55 ≈ 2.11\n\n---\n\n#### Debt to Asset Ratio  \n\nHere, Total Debt = Total Liabilities. Only current liabilities given: 2,491,297.55  \nNo long term liabilities provided, so total debt = current liabilities = 2,491,297.55  \n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Debt / Total Assets  \n= 2,491,297.55 / 14,089,860.66 ≈ 0.18\n\n---\n\n#### Debt to Equity Ratio  \n\nDebt to Equity = Total Debt / Total Owner's Equity  \n= 2,491,297.55 / 11,598,563.11 ≈ 0.21\n\n---\n\n#### Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \n\nCash Flow to Debt = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt  \n= -4,398,760.38 / 2,491,297.55 ≈ -1.77\n\n---\n\n### Final answers rounded to two decimals:\n\n- Current Ratio: 3.54  \n- Quick Ratio: 2.11  \n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.18  \n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.21  \n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: -1.77\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Current Ratio\": \"3.54\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"2.11\", \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.18\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.21\", \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-1.77\"}}\n```",
