                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate:\n\n1. Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity  \n2. Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100%  \n3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities  \n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Extract given values from the problem\n\nFrom the balance sheet (End amounts):\n\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08  \n- Total Owner's Equity = 10,964,263.48  \n- Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity = 12,566,098.56  \n- Total Assets = 12,566,098.56  \n\nCalculate total liabilities:\n\nTotal Liabilities = Total Assets - Total Owner's Equity  \n= 12,566,098.56 - 10,964,263.48  \n= 1,601,835.08 (which matches the current liabilities given)  \n\nSince no other liabilities shown separately, assume total liabilities = total current liabilities = 1,601,835.08  \n\nFrom cash flow:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,856,840.58  \n\nFrom income statement:\n\n- Net Profit = -2,035,736.52  \n- Total Revenue = 6,836,701.10  \n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity  \n= 1,601,835.08 / 10,964,263.48  \n≈ 0.14606 ≈ 0.15 (rounded to two decimals)  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Net Profit Margin\n\nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100%  \n= (-2,035,736.52 / 6,836,701.10) * 100%  \n≈ -0.2978 * 100% = -29.78%  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities  \n= -6,856,840.58 / 1,601,835.08  \n≈ -4.28 (rounded two decimals)  \n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.15\", \"Net Profit Margin\": \"-29.78%\", \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-4.28\"}}\n```",
