                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the following financial ratios based on the given data:\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio** = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity  \n   From balance sheet at end date:  \n   - Total Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08  \n   - No long-term liabilities explicitly given, so we assume total liabilities = current liabilities = 1,601,835.08  \n   - Total Owner's Equity = 10,964,263.48  \n   \n   Debt to Equity Ratio = 1,601,835.08 / 10,964,263.48 ≈ 0.146\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin** = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%  \n   From income statement:  \n   - Net Profit = -2,035,736.52  \n   - Total Revenue = 6,836,701.10  \n   \n   Net Profit Margin = (-2,035,736.52 / 6,836,701.10) × 100% ≈ -29.79%\n\n3. **Return on Assets (ROA)** = (Net Profit / Total Assets) × 100%  \n   From balance sheet at end date:  \n   - Total Assets = 12,566,098.56  \n   - Net Profit = -2,035,736.52  \n   \n   ROA = (-2,035,736.52 / 12,566,098.56) × 100% ≈ -16.19%\n\n4. **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio** = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable  \n   Here typically, sales are the total revenue. We assume all sales are credit sales for this calculation.  \n   \n   Accounts Receivable (beginning) = 0.00 (since initial is zero)  \n   Accounts Receivable (ending) = 3,098,023.69  \n   \n   Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 3,098,023.69) / 2 = 1,549,011.85  \n   \n   Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 6,836,701.10 / 1,549,011.85 ≈ 4.41\n\n---\n\n### Final answers:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.15\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"-29.79%\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"-16.19%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"4.41\"\n  }\n}\n```",
