None indicated; payments mostly by Cash or labeled otherwise.\n   - Expenses paid by Bank Transfer? None recorded, expenses seem paid by Cash.\n   \n3. **Summarize all relevant transactions for bank deposits:**\n\n   - Initial Bank deposits: 5,000,000.00\n\n   - Subtract payments made via Bank Transfer:\n     Check Purchase and Fixed Asset Purchase records with payment_method = \"Bank Transfer\" and payment/receipt_status = \"Paid\"\n\n   Purchases paid by Bank Transfer:\n   - Purchase20231231003: 600,000.0\n   - Purchase20231231007: 850,000.0\n   - Purchase20231231011: 1,100,000.0\n   Fixed Assets Purchase:\n   - FixedAsset20231231001 (S003): 362,437.67 (paid Bank Transfer)\n   - FixedAsset20231231001 (S003): 303,640.51 (paid Bank Transfer)\n   Also:\n   - Purchase20231231001: 340,000.0 - paid by Bank Transfer - yes\n   - Purchase20231231008: 800,000 - Unpaid via Account Payable - so no cash outflow yet.\n   - Purchase20231231009: 130,000 - Paid by Bank Transfer\n   Initial purchase entries include these:\n   - Purchase20231231001: 340,000 (Bank Transfer)\n   - Purchase20231231003: 600,000 (Bank Transfer)\n   - Purchase20231231007: 850,000 (Bank Transfer)\n   - Purchase20231231011: 1,100,000 (Bank Transfer)\n   - Purchase20231231009: 130,000 (Bank Transfer)\n  \n   Total bank transfer purchases paid:\n   340,000 + 600,000 + 850,000 + 1,100,000 + 130,000 = 3,020,000\n\n   Fixed Assets paid by Bank Transfer:\n   362,437.67 + 303,640.51 = 666,078.18\n   \n   Total payments out of bank deposit = 3,020,000 + 666,078.18 = 3,686,078.18\n\n   - Transfers:\n     - Bank to cash transfers (reduce bank deposits):\n       - 2024-01-09: 100,000.0\n       - Multiple on 2024-01-10: five entries of 100,000.0 each = 500,000.0\n       - 2024-01-11: six entries of 100,000.0 each = 600,000.0\n       - 2024-01-12: five entries of 100,000.0 each = 500,000.0\n       - 2024-01-13: one entry of 100,000.0\n       - 2024-01-14: one entry of 100,000.0\n       Total Bank to cash transfers:\n       100,000 + 500,000 + 600,000 + 500,000 + 100,000 + 100,000 = 1,900,000\n       \n     - Cash to bank transfers (increase bank deposits):\n       - 2024-01-24: one entry 100,000.0\n       - 2024-01-25: two entries 100,000.0 each = 200,000.0\n       - 2024-01-27: four entries 100,000.0 each = 400,000.0\n       - 2024-01-28: seven entries 100,000.0 each = 700,000.0\n       - 2024-01-29: seven entries 100,000.0 each = 700,000.0\n       Total Cash to bank transfers:\n       100,000 + 200,000 + 400,000 + 700,000 + 700,000 = 2,100,000\n\n   Net transfers effect on bank deposits = +2,100,000 - 1,900,000 = +200,000\n\n4. **Calculate final bank deposit amount:**\n\n   Initial bank deposits: 5,000,000.0  \n   Subtract payments via Bank Transfer: -3,686,078.18  \n   Add net transfer from cash to bank: +200,000.0\n\n   Result: 5,000,000 - 3,686,078.18 + 200,000 = 1,513,921.82\n\n5. **Consider sales receipts or other incomes directly increasing bank deposit?**\n   Most sales receipts are via Cash or Account Receivable, none tagged as Bank Transfer or directly affecting bank deposits.\n\n   So no addition from sales receipts to bank deposits to consider here.\n\n6. **Summary:**\n\n   - Initial bank deposits = 5,000,000.00\n   - Ending bank deposits = 1,513,921.82\n\n**Final answer formatted:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"1513921.82\"}}\n```",
