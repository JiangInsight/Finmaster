                        "content": "To calculate the total owner's equity at the initial and end dates, we use the following steps:\n\n**Step 1: Initial Owner's Equity Calculation**\n- Owner's equity at the start (Initial) consists of initial recorded assets and capitals.\n- From the initial records provided:\n  - Cash deposit = 3,000,000.0\n  - Bank deposit = 5,000,000.0\n  - Fixed Assets = 5,000,000.0\n- Total Initial Owner's Equity = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.0\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the end owner's equity**\n\nOwner's equity at the end equals:\n\nInitial Owner's Equity  \n+ Net Profit (or - Net Loss)  \n- Dividends (not mentioned here, so assumed 0)  \n+ Additional Capital (none mentioned)  \n- Drawings (none mentioned)  \n\nWe can calculate net profit as:\n\nNet Profit = Revenue (Sales) - Expenses (Administrative, Sales, Financial, Depreciation, Interest) - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\n\nWe will gather the main components from the transactions:\n\n- Initial owner's equity = 13,000,000 (from above)\n- Sales revenue: Sum amounts from Sale transactions (amount column)\n- Expenses: Sum amounts from all Expense and Depreciation transactions (amount column)\n- Interest: These entries are interest receivables (asset) or financial expenses; for owner equity we consider expenses incurring.\n- Purchases: purchase transactions impact inventory and cost of goods sold but do not directly affect owner equity in final as expenses via COGS or Inventory changes — for simplicity, cost of goods sold is embedded in \"cost_amount\" or profit calculations.\n- We consider profit reported in each sale as profit column though profit column is only in examples.\n\n**Extract relevant sums:**\n\nFrom the data:\n- Initial: 13,000,000\n\n- Sales total amount: Sum of all sale amounts\n\n- Expenses total amount = Sum of all \"Expense\" transactions amounts + depreciation amounts\n\n- Interest Receivables is unpaid interest (asset), ignore for owner's equity change directly; Financial Expenses count as expense.\n\n- Purchases are asset increases or inventory increases, impact is through cost of goods sold embedded in profit calculations.\n\nSince profit is not fully explicit here, we use approach:\n\n**Calculate total sales revenue** (sum Sale amounts)  \n**Calculate total expenses** (sum Expense, Depreciation amounts)  \n**Net Profit = Sales - Expenses**\n\n---\n\n**Summations:**\n\n- Initial Owner's Equity = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.00\n\n**Sales amounts:**  \nAdding the \"Sale\" types' \"amount\" from the data:  \n(For brevity, I will sum from the data given)\n\nFrom the transactions we have many sales with amounts listed.
