Usually, these are the \"Purchase\" transactions amounts.\n\nOther expense types such as Administrative Expenses, Sales Expenses, Financial Expenses, Depreciation, Interest Receivables, and Fixed Assets purchases are operational or non-operational expenses and assets, not included in the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" or \"Total Cost\" for the Income Statement.\n\nStep 1: Identify all \"Purchase\" transactions and sum their \"amount\" field.\n\nReviewing the \"Purchase\" entries and extracting their amounts:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 340,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231002: 1,900,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231003: 600,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231004: 260,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231005: 460,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231006: 450,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231007: 1,500,000.0 (combined likely from earlier)\n- Purchase20231231008: 800,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231009: 800,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231010: 1,500,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231011: 1,100,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231012: 60,000.0  \n\nNow sum these amounts:\n\n340,000 + 1,900,000 + 600,000 + 260,000 + 460,000 + 450,000 + 850,000 (corrected 850,000 from entry) + 800,000 + 800,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,100,000 + 60,000 = ?\n\nLet's be exact-to-entry:\n\nFrom data:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 340,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231002: 1,900,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231003: 600,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231004: 260,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231005: 460,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231006: 450,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231007: 850,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231008: 800,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231009: 800,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231010: 1,500,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231011: 1,100,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231012: 60,000.0  \n\nSum:\n\n340,000  \n+ 1,900,000 = 2,240,000  \n+ 600,000 = 2,840,000  \n+ 260,000 = 3,100,000  \n+ 460,000 = 3,560,000  \n+ 450,000 = 4,010,000  \n+ 850,000 = 4,860,000  \n+ 800,000 = 5,660,000  \n+ 800,000 = 6,460,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 7,960,000  \n+ 1,100,000 = 9,060,000  \n+ 60,000 = 9,120,000  \n\nStep 2: The final total cost in the income statement corresponds to the sum of all purchase amounts, i.e., **9,120,000.00**\n\nOther expenses (administrative, sales, financial, depreciation) are not part of cost of goods sold or production cost.\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Cost\": \"9120000.00\"}}\n````",
