Typically, this includes:\n\n- Cash outflows for purchasing fixed assets.\n- Cash inflows from selling fixed assets (none provided here).\n- Any other investing cash flows (none indicated here).\n\nStep 1: Identify transactions related to investing activities.\n\nFrom the input:\n\nLooking for transactions involving Fixed Assets purchase (asset_type related entries), especially those with payment_method indicating actual cash or bank transfer paid.\n\nRelevant transactions:\n\n1. FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | Paid | Bank Transfer | Amount: 362437.67 | Asset Name: Storage Facilities4  \n2. FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | Paid | Bank Transfer | Amount: 303640.51 | Asset Name: Processing Equipment5  \n\nThese two are fixed assets purchases with payment recorded as paid (cash outflow).\n\nStep 2: Sum the cash outflows related to investing activities.\n\n- 362,437.67\n- 303,640.51\n\nTotal outflow = 362,437.67 + 303,640.51 = 666,078.18\n\nNo entries indicating inflows from sales of fixed assets or other investing activities were found.\n\nStep 3: Final net cash flow from investing activities\n\nNet investing cash flow = sum of inflows - sum of outflows  \n= 0 - 666,078.18 = -666,078.18\n\nTherefore, the net cash flow from investing activities is -666,078.18\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-666078.18\"}}\n```",
