Identify all transactions of type \"Purchase\" that relate to the acquisition of goods/products.\n2. Sum all \"amount\" values from these purchase transactions - these represent the cost of acquiring inventory.\n3. Exclude transactions related to assets or expenses or any non-product purchases.\n4. The sum of these purchase transaction amounts = Cost of Goods Sold for simplification, assuming all purchased goods were sold or used for production.\n\n---\n\nStep 1 & 2: Extract purchase amounts (transaction type \"Purchase\"):\n\nFrom the given data:\n\n| id              | type     | amount     | product_name         |\n|-----------------|----------|------------|----------------------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | Purchase | 340,000.0   | Chemical Product B   |\n| Purchase20231231002 | Purchase | 1,900,000.0 | Chemical Product D   |\n| Purchase20231231003 | Purchase | 600,000.0   | Chemical Product C   |\n| Purchase20231231004 | Purchase | 260,000.0   | Chemical Product A   |\n| Purchase20231231005 | Purchase | 460,000.0   | Chemical Product B   |\n| Purchase20231231006 | Purchase | 450,000.0   | Chemical Product C   |\n| Purchase20231231007 | Purchase | 850,000.0   | Chemical Product C   |\n| Purchase20231231008 | Purchase | 800,000.0   | Chemical Product C   |\n| Purchase20231231009 | Purchase | 800,000.0   | Chemical Product D   |\n| Purchase20231231010 | Purchase | 1,500,000.0 | Chemical Product D   |\n| Purchase20231231011 | Purchase | 1,100,000.0 | Chemical Product C   |\n| Purchase20231231012 | Purchase | 60,000.0    | Chemical Product A   |\n\nStep 3: Sum all these amounts:\n\n340,000.0  \n+ 1,900,000.0  \n+ 600,000.0  \n+ 260,000.0  \n+ 460,000.0  \n+ 450,000.0  \n+ 850,000.0  \n+ 800,000.0  \n+ 800,000.0  \n+ 1,500,000.0  \n+ 1,100,000.0  \n+ 60,000.0  \n= ?\n\nCalculate the sum:\n\n340,000  \n+ 1,900,000 = 2,240,000  \n+ 600,000 = 2,840,000  \n+ 260,000 = 3,100,000  \n+ 460,000 = 3,560,000  \n+ 450,000 = 4,010,000  \n+ 850,000 = 4,860,000  \n+ 800,000 = 5,660,000  \n+ 800,000 = 6,460,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 7,960,000  \n+ 1,100,000 = 9,060,000  \n+ 60,000 = 9,120,000\n\n---\n\nTherefore, the Cost of Goods Sold = 9,120,000.00\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"9120000.00\"}}\n```",
