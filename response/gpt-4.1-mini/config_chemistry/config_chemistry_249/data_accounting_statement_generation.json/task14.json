                        "content": "To calculate the current liabilities in the balance sheet, including both the initial and final amounts, we need to identify liabilities that are current (short-term liabilities) from the data:\n\n**Step 1: Initial Value (on 2023-12-31)**  \n- Check if there are any current liabilities recorded as of the initial date (2023-12-31):\n- From the given data, initial records only include Cash deposit, Bank deposit, and Fixed Assets.  \n- There are no explicit current liabilities entries (such as \"Account Payable\" or unpaid purchases on initial date).\n\nSo,  \n**Total Current Liabilities Initial Value = 0.00**\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Current Liabilities at the end (based on unpaid purchases and other unpaid amounts):**\n\nFrom the transactions, typical accounts payable or current liabilities are:  \n- Purchase transactions with payment/receipt_status == \"Unpaid\" and payment_method indicating accounts payable (e.g., \"Account Payable\").  \n- Unpaid purchase amounts contribute to current liabilities (money owed to suppliers).  \n\nScan the purchases with unpaid status:\n\n- Purchase20231231005: amount 460,000.0, Unpaid, payment_method = Account Payable → included  \n- Purchase20231231008: amount 800,000.0, Unpaid, payment_method = Account Payable → included  \n\nNo other unpaid purchase with account payable. Other purchases are paid or paid by cash/bank transfer.\n\n---\n\nSum of unpaid purchases (current liabilities):\n\n460,000.0 + 800,000.0 = 1,260,000.0\n\n---\n\nFurther check:\n\nAre there other current liabilities?  \n- Some purchases were unpaid but payment method is not \"Account Payable\" (e.g., \"Cash\", \"Bank Transfer\") → These are less likely liabilities, since Cash or Bank Transfer suggests maybe a different arrangement or prepaid/debts settled or not relevant for current liabilities.  \n- Expenses are paid, so generally no liabilities there.\n\nNo other explicit current liabilities found in the data.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Verify if any other unpaid liabilities:**\n\nNo other entries with unpaid status and payment method as \"Account Payable\" or similar.\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**\n\n- Total Current Liabilities Initial Value = 0.00  \n- Total Current Liabilities End Value = 1,260,000.00\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"1260000.00\"}}\n```",
