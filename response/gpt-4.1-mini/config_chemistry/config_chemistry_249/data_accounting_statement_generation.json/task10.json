                        "content": "To calculate the property, plant and non-current assets in the balance sheet, including both initial and final amounts, we need to:\n\n1. Identify the initial value of non-current assets from the \"Initial\" entries, specifically the line with type \"Fixed Assets\" on the initial date.\n2. Sum up any additions to non-current assets from the transactions recorded afterward (such as purchases or fixed asset purchases).\n3. Deduct accumulated depreciation to find the ending value of the non-current assets.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Initial Non-current Assets**\n\nFrom the initial entries on 2023-12-31:\n\n- Fixed Assets initial amount: 5,000,000.0\n\nThis is the starting value for non-current assets.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Additions to Non-current Assets**\n\nLook for entries related to Fixed Assets Purchase after the initial date.\n\nFrom the data, fixed asset purchases are recorded as:\n\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 362,437.67 (Storage Facilities4)\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 303,640.51 (Processing Equipment5)\n\nThese two are at the initial date, so presumably they are part of initial non-current assets or additions on initial date.\n\nAdditionally, no other fixed asset purchase entries with later dates are evident. Purchases of products (P001, P002 etc.) are inventory or expenses, not non-current assets.\n\nSo total fixed assets purchases at initial date = 362,437.67 + 303,640.51 = 666,078.18\n\nAdd to initial 5,000,000 fixed assets, which might mean the initial fixed assets reported as 5,000,000 already include these items, or these are additions to initial amount.\n\nGiven the initial \"Fixed Assets\" amount is 5,000,000 on 2023-12-31, and these Fixed Asset purchases are also dated 2023-12-31, for safety, consider them part of initial fixed assets balance included in 5,000,000.\n\nNo additional fixed asset purchases after 2023-12-31 in the data portion.\n\nTherefore, additional fixed asset purchases after initial date = 0\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Deduct Accumulated Depreciation**\n\nWe have two depreciation entries:\n\n- Depreciation20240101001 | 2024-01-01 | 45,748.2\n\n- Depreciation20240201002 | 2024-02-01 | 54,491.689999999995 (~54,491.69)\n\nTotal depreciation accumulated by end = 45,748.20 + 54,491.69 = 100,239.89\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Final Non-current Assets**\n\nAssuming no disposals or impairment, ending non-current assets = Initial fixed assets + additions - accumulated depreciation\n\nAdditions after initial date are zero, so:\n\nEnding Non-current Assets = 5,000,000.00 - 100,239.89 = 4,899,760.11 (approx)\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '4899760.11'}}\n```",
