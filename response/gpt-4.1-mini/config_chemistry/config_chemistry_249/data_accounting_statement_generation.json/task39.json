Identify all interest receivable amounts at the beginning and at the end of the period.\n   - The starting interest receivable balance is the interest receivable amount on the earliest date.\n   - The ending interest receivable balance is the interest receivable amount on the latest date.\n\n2. Calculate the net increase or decrease:\n   \\[\n   \\text{(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable} = \\text{Ending Interest Receivable} - \\text{Beginning Interest Receivable}\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Identify the beginning interest receivable**\n\n- Starting date in data: 2023-12-31 (Initial entries don't show interest receivable)\n- The earliest \"Interest Receivables\" entry: On 2024-01-01, Interest Receivables amount = 414.74 (approx)\n\nSo, beginning balance = 414.74\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify the ending interest receivable**\n\n- Latest date entry with Interest Receivables is on 2024-02-01 with amount = 8.942953179999963\n\nSo, ending balance = 8.94295318 (approx)\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the change**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Change} = 8.94295318 - 414.74 = -405.79704682\n\\]\n\nRounded to 2 decimals = -405.80\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Interpretation**\n\n- Negative number means a decrease in interest receivable (i.e., collections or write-offs)\n\n---\n\n### Final answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-405.80\"}}\n```",
