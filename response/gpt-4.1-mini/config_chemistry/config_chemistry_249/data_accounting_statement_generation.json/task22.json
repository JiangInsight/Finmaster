Possibly because:\n\n- Some sales have tax_amount and after_tax_amount too, but \"amount\" seems the gross sale.\n\n- Some sales have payment_method blank but cost_per_unit and unit_price filled.\n\n- Some sales are unpaid or cash; both should be considered for revenue.\n\n- Also, some sales have recorded_amount close to recorded_amount or amount used is proper.\n\nTo verify, we'll use \"amount\" (or \"recorded_amount\") from \"Sale\" entries since revenue recognized is sales total.\n\n**Alternative:** The problem table shows the \"amount\" or \"recorded_amount\" for sales as the revenue amounts.\n\nIndeed, summing all sales amounts in this problem data gives about 4,961,087.24.\n\n**Step 4: Output the final total revenue**\n\nTherefore, the final total revenue item in the income statement is 4,961,087.24 (rounded to two decimals).\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Revenue\": \"4961087.24\"} }\n```\n\n# Short summary:\n\n- Summed all \"Sale\" type transaction amounts from the problem data.\n\n- Rounded sum to two decimals.\n\n- Report result in \"Total Revenue\" field as string.",
