Cash inflows (receipts) that increase cash.\n3. Cash outflows (payments) that decrease cash.\n4. Transfers between cash and bank (they do not affect total cash + cash equivalents, just the makeup).\n5. Ignore non-cash items like depreciation.\n6. Only consider actual cash movements and cash equivalents (cash and bank).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Balances\n\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n- Total initial cash and cash equivalents = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000.0\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze transactions to identify cash inflows and outflows for 2024\n\n- **Purchases paid by Cash** decrease cash.\n- **Expenses paid by Cash** decrease cash.\n- **Sales received in Cash** increase cash.\n- **Transfers (Cash to Bank or Bank to Cash)** shift balances between cash and bank; no net effect on total cash and equivalents.\n- **Purchases paid by Bank Transfer** do not affect cash.\n- **Expenses paid by Bank Transfer** do not affect cash.\n- **Interest receivables are unpaid**, so no effect.\n- **Depreciation and other non-cash expenses** are ignored.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Sum receipts and payments affecting cash\n\n**Cash Outflows:**\n\n- Purchases with `payment_method` = Cash and Paid reduce cash:\n  -

The initial cash deposit (3,000,000) plus bank deposit (5,000,000) gives the beginning balance of 8,000,000. Transactions during the period adjust cash, but the beginning balance remains the opening figure for the cash flow statement.",
