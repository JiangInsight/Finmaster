We are asked to identify and extract:\n   - The end value of funds deposited into the bank.\n   - The income earned by the entity from financial assets.\n\n2. From the Balance Sheet section:\n   - Look for the line item representing funds deposited into a bank.\n   - The appropriate line item is \"Bank Deposits\".\n   - The End_amount for Bank Deposits is 100482.62 (as of 2024-02-01).\n\n3. From the Income Statement section:\n   - Look for income earned from financial assets.\n   - The relevant line item is usually \"Interest Income\".\n   - Interest Income is 5155.34 (as of 2024-02-01).\n\n4. The Cash Flow Statement does not provide any direct line item relevant to these two specific information pieces besides the already identified ones.\n\n5. According to task instructions, the output should be grouped by financial statement order:\n   - Balance Sheet first: Extracted \"Bank Deposits\" End_amount: 100482.62\n   - Income Statement second: Extracted \"Interest Income\" Amount: 5155.34\n\nHence, the final JSON output is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"100482.62\", \"value2\": \"5155.34\"}}\n```",
