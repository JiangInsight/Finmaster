The amount of profit an entity retains after all expenses including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization have been deducted from total revenue.\n2. The cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\nLooking at the problem data, these correspond to:\n\n- **Net Profit** line item, which shows the profit retained after all expenses.\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets** line item, representing cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- Net Profit = -2035736.52\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets = 666078.18\n\nThus, the final output is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '-2035736.52', 'value2': '666078.18'} }\n```\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '-2035736.52', 'value2': '666078.18'} }\n```",
