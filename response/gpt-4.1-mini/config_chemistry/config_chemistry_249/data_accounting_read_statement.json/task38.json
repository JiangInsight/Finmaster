Since it is negative, it indicates an increase in amounts owed (accounts receivable increased), so the decrease in amounts owed is negative, meaning amounts owed actually increased.\n\nBut the task is to extract the value of decrease in amounts owed, so the relevant value to report is the value given for \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable,\" which is `-3098023.69`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-3098023.69\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-3098023.69\"} }\n```",
