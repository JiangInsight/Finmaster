                        "content": "Step 1: Identify the three specific line items and values requested:\n\n1. Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense  \n   From the **Income Statement**: \"Profit Before Tax\" = -1693901.44\n\n2. The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period  \n   This refers to the increase in **Accounts Payable** from the **Balance Sheet** or the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" from the **Cash Flow Statement** (both indicate the same). We'll use the **Balance Sheet** figure for uniformity as instructed by order and original line item order.  \n   From **Balance Sheet**, \"Accounts Payable\" End_amount = 1260000.00 (since initial was zero, this is the increase during period).\n\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares  \n   From **Balance Sheet**, \"Paid-in Capital\" End_amount = 13000000.00\n\nStep 2: Group by financial statement in the order:  \n1. Balance Sheet  \n- Capital contributed by shareholders: Paid-in Capital = 13000000.00  \n- Addition in amount owed for goods/services on credit: Accounts Payable = 1260000.00\n\n2. Income Statement  \n- Profit before tax = -1693901.44\n\nSince the instruction says to group outputs by financial statement in order - Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement, then Cash Flow Statement. But since the second requested item (\"addition in the amount owed\") comes from Balance Sheet or Cash Flow Statement, we should pick from the Balance Sheet as per example. The profit before tax from Income Statement.\n\nHence values are:\n\n- value1: Capital contributed by shareholders (Balance Sheet, Paid-in Capital) = \"13000000.00\"  \n- value2: Profit before tax (Income Statement) = \"-1693901.44\"  \n- value3: Addition in amount owed (Balance Sheet, Accounts Payable) = \"1260000.00\"\n\nBut the example solution had the order:\n\nvalue1 = \"Paid-in Capital\" (Balance Sheet)  \nvalue2 = \"Profit Before Tax\" (Income Statement)  \nvalue3 = \"Accounts Payable\" (Balance Sheet)\n\nSince the problem states \"For multiple outputs, group them by financial statement in the following order: 1. Balance Sheet 2. Income Statement 3. Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement.\"\n\nWe have two line items from Balance Sheet, one from Income Statement. In the example solution, \"Paid-in Capital\" (Balance Sheet) was value1, \"Profit Before Tax\" (Income Statement) value2, and \"Accounts Payable\" (Balance Sheet) value3. So the example has value3 from Balance Sheet but it comes last because of original line item order?\n\nBut original line item order in Balance Sheet is:\n\n- Accounts Payable  \n- Taxes Payable  \n- Total Current Liabilities  \n- Paid-in Capital\n\nSo actually \"Accounts Payable\" comes before \"Paid-in Capital\" in Balance Sheet.\n\nHence, according to instructions, within Balance Sheet group, maintain original line item order. So \"Accounts Payable\" comes before \"Paid-in Capital\".\n\nSo grouping and ordering:\n\nBalance Sheet:  \n1) Accounts Payable = 1260000.00  \n2) Paid-in Capital = 13000000.00\n\nIncome Statement:  \n3) Profit Before Tax = -1693901.44\n\nThe problem states: group outputs by financial statement in the order:  \n1. Balance Sheet  \n2. Income Statement  \n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nWithin each group, maintain original line item order as shown in the input statement.\n\nSo final order:\n\nvalue1 = Accounts Payable (Balance Sheet) = 1260000.00  \nvalue2 = Paid-in Capital (Balance Sheet) = 13000000.00  \nvalue3 = Profit Before Tax (Income Statement) = -1693901.44\n\nBut the example's solution had a different order, probably because they matched the given 3 requested values to their corresponding financial statement in order and within each group the line item order was maintained. If we were to map the requested items:\n\n1) Profit or loss before tax (Income Statement)  \n2) Addition in amount owed - Accounts Payable (Balance Sheet)  \n3) Capital contributed by shareholders - Paid-in Capital (Balance Sheet)\n\nRearranging to keep first Balance Sheet items, then Income Statement:\n\nBalance Sheet line items:  \n- Accounts Payable  \n- Paid-in Capital  \n\nIncome Statement line items:  \n- Profit Before Tax\n\nHence, final answer per instructions:  \nvalue1 = Accounts Payable = \"1260000.00\"  \nvalue2 = Paid-in Capital = \"13000000.00\"  \nvalue3 = Profit Before Tax = \"-1693901.44\"\n\nHowever, the example solution output was:\n\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '-1373590.51', 'value3': '1590000.00'}}\n\nWhere value1 was capital contributed, value2 was profit before tax, value3 was accounts payable.\n\nSo, the example prefers to output in order:  \nBalance Sheet - Paid-in Capital  \nIncome Statement - Profit Before Tax  \nBalance Sheet - Accounts Payable\n\nFollowing the example's approach:\n\nvalue1: Paid-in Capital (Balance Sheet) = 13000000.00  \nvalue2: Profit Before Tax (Income Statement) = -1693901.44  \nvalue3: Accounts Payable (Balance Sheet) = 1260000.00\n\nI will follow this format to be consistent with example.\n\nFinal solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"13000000.00\", \"value2\": \"-1693901.44\", \"value3\": \"1260000.00\"}}\n```\n\n# Final answer: \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"13000000.00\", \"value2\": \"-1693901.44\", \"value3\": \"1260000.00\"}}\n```",
