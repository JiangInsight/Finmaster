The \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section under the cash flow statement contains the relevant information.\n2. Within that section, the \"Beginning Balance\" shows the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.\n3. According to the cash flow table, the \"Beginning Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" is 8,000,000.00 as of 2024-02-01.\n4. This aligns with the initial amount of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" combined in the balance sheet at the initial date (2023-12-31), confirming the beginning cash and cash equivalents.\n\nHence, the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period is 8000000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"8000000.00\"}}\n```",
