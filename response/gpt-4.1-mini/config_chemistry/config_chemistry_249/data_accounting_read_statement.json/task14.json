Usually, these are current liabilities, which include:\n\n- Accounts Payable\n- Taxes Payable\n- Total Current Liabilities\n\nStep 2: Extract the initial and end values of these liabilities from the given table.\n\n- Accounts Payable: Initial_amount = 0.00, End_amount = 1260000.00\n- Taxes Payable: Initial_amount = 0.00, End_amount = 341835.08\n- Total Current Liabilities: Initial_amount = 0.00, End_amount = 1601835.08\n\nStep 3: The Total Current Liabilities is the sum of the current liabilities expected to be settled in the operating cycle. The initial value is 0.00, and the end value is 1,601,835.08.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of liabilities expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle is:\n\nInitial value: 0.00  \nEnd value: 1,601,835.08\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"1601835.08\"}}\n```",
