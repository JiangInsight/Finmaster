The cost incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services to customers.\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\nWe must group the results by financial statement in the order of:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nAnd maintain the original order of line items as presented.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify the line item for cost incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services to customers.\n\nThis is typically reflected as **Selling Expenses** in the Income Statement, since that represents expenses related to delivering and selling goods or services.\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n\n| Account           | Amount     | Date       |\n|-------------------|------------|------------|\n| Selling Expenses  | 477715.85  | 2024-02-01 |\n\nThus, **value1** = 477715.85 (Selling Expenses from Income Statement)\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\nThis is typically shown as **Purchase of Fixed Assets** (or similar) in the Cash Flow Statement under Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n\n| Account             | Amount     | Date       |\n|---------------------|------------|------------|\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets | 666078.18 | 2024-02-01 |\n\nThus, **value2** = 666078.18 (Purchase of Fixed Assets from Cash Flow Statement)\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Balance sheet check for relevant items:\n\n- The balance sheet here shows Fixed Assets and Accumulated Depreciation, but no direct line item showing costs incurred to secure orders or acquisition outflows. So no relevant line items to extract here.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"477715.85\", \"value2\": \"666078.18\"}}\n```",
