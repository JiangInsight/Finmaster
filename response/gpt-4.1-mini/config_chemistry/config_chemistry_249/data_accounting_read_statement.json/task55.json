Look for tax-related line items in the financial statements (balance sheet, cash flow, income statement).\n2. In the balance sheet, \"Taxes Payable\" is 341835.08 at the period end, indicating taxes expected to be paid.\n3. In the income statement, \"Tax Expense\" is 341835.08, which represents the total tax amount for the reporting period.\n4. The value is consistent in both places, confirming the total tax amount related to the reporting period.\n\nThus, the total amount of tax payable or recoverable is 341835.08.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"341835.08\"}}\n```\n",
