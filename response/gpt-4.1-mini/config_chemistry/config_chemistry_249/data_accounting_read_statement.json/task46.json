We need to identify the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities related to:\n   - acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents\n   - receipt of interest and dividends\n\n2. From the input cash flow statement, the relevant section is \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n\n3. The line items under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" in the problem are:\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 666078.18\n   - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -666078.18\n\n4. There is no explicit item related to receipt of interest and dividends in the provided data.\n\n5. The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" value is -666078.18, which indicates cash outflow because of acquisition of fixed assets (long-term assets).\n\n6. Since only one sub-item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" corresponds to this cash flow and that contributes directly to the net investing cash flow, that is the only sub-item.\n\nHence:\n\n- The net amount is: -666078.18\n- The sub-item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" value: 666078.18\n\n(Note: The sub-item value is positive in the table but since it is a cash outflow, the net cash flow line shows negative as expected.)\n\nFormatting answer as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-666078.18\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"666078.18\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-666078.18\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"666078.18\"}}\n```",
