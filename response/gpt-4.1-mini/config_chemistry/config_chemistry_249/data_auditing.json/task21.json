The data is consistent with all fields matching and totaling correctly.\n\nNo other transactions with errors were clearly identifiable in this dataset snippet except the explicitly indicated errors in the examples. Since the problem only contains this input data, and no explicit inconsistencies appear other than those in the example, the solution is no errors for this transaction.\n\nIf other inconsistencies were found outside this input, they would be reported similarly, but this input shows only consistent data for each record.\n\nHence the output reflects no errors detected for the provided transactions.",
