Purchase20231231009: Recorded unit price and amount mismatch invoice data.\n2. Sale20240129055: Recorded unit price and amount mismatch invoice data.\n\nOther entries reviewed are consistent with invoice details, quantities, and computed totals.\n\nHence, report inconsistency as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Purchase\", \"Recorded category\": \"Purchase\", \"Original date\": \"2023-12-31\", \"Recorded date\": \"2023-12-31\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Original payment_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original quantity\": \"8.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"8.0\", \"Original price\": \"100000.0\", \"Recorded price\": \"98968.11\", \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"800000.0\", \"Recorded amount\": \"934130.96\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": \"Supervisor\", \"Recorded Preparer\": \"Supervisor\", \"Original Approver\": \"Director\", \"Recorded Approver\": \"Director\", \"id\": \"Purchase20231231009\"}} \n```\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-29\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-29\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Original payment_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original quantity\": \"4.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"4.0\", \"Original price\": \"57974.33\", \"Recorded price\": \"62212.54\", \"Original receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original amount\": \"231897.32\", \"Recorded amount\": \"285452.20\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Sale20240129055\"}}\n```\n\nNo other entries have clear internal inconsistencies identifiable with invoice text and fields.",
