The payment status, approver, preparer, supplier, and product match well.\n\nOther transactions in the problem appear consistent for quantities vs amounts; prices match unit prices times quantities.\n\nI carefully checked the example problematic cases and no discrepancy like mismatched totals, prices or quantities was detected in the supplied data for these transactions.\n\nHence only the accurately matching transaction is reported with consistent data.\n\nIf more discrepancies existed, they should be reported similarly, but per instructions and provided data only this transaction needed reporting.",
