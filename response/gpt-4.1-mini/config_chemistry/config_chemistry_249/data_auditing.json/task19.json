But here the row is consistent with 17 units * 20000 = 340000.\n- Thus, no inconsistency detected in this input row for Purchase20231231001.\n- Other transactions either have no inconsistencies or no conflicting data fields to correct.\n- Therefore, the record as it stands is consistent and no errors are detected or corrected beyond confirming the values are consistent as recorded.\n\nIf any other inconsistency were found, it would be reported similarly.",
