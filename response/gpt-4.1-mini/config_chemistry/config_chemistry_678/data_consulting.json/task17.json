From the balance sheet, given we only have current liabilities and no explicit long-term liabilities, total debt = Total Current Liabilities = 737,762.05\n\nStep 3: Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \n= (-7,724,112.71) / 737,762.05  \nâ‰ˆ -10.47\n\nThe ratio is negative, which indicates operating cash flow is negative and much lower compared to the current liabilities (debt).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-10.47\"}}\n```",
