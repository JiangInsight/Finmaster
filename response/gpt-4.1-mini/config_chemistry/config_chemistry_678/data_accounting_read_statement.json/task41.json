From the problem statement, we look for the line item related to tax accrued but not paid.\n2. In the cash flow statement, the closest matching line item is \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\".\n3. The amount for this line item is 287762.05.\n\nTherefore, the value corresponding to the increase in tax payable (tax accrued but not paid) is 287762.05.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"287762.05\"}}\n```",
