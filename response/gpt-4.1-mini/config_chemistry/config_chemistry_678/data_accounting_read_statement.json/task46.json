We are looking for the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities related to:\n   - Acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments (which usually falls under Cash Flow from Investing Activities).\n   - Receipt of interest and dividends (these would typically appear explicitly if present).\n\n2. From the given statement, the relevant section is:\n   - \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\"\n   - Items under it:\n     - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 480,116.37\n     - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -480,116.37\n\n3. Receipt of interest and dividends do not appear explicitly in this problem data.\n\n4. The net cash generated from these activities is the net cash flow from investing activities: -480,116.37\n\n5. The sub-item in the investing activities is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with value 480,116.37 (positive number, as it is presumably a cash outflow). The net cash flow is negative because cash was spent (outflow).\n\n6. According to the example, the output should present the net amount (sign included) and the sub-item values as positive (as the example has a sub-item with positive value, but main item negative).\n\nThus,\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-480116.37\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"480116.37\"}}\n```\n\nNote: The field format requires 'sub_items_sub_item value' for the sub-item final value as in example.",
