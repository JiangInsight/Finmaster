This amount is typically reflected under \"Total Current Liabilities.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the line items related to liabilities that are expected to be settled within the operating cycle (usually current liabilities).\n2. From the balance sheet provided, the relevant line items are:\n   - Accounts Payable\n   - Taxes Payable\n   - Total Current Liabilities (which should be the sum of the above)\n3. Extract the initial and end values for Total Current Liabilities:\n   - Initial value (2023-12-31): 0.00\n   - End value (2024-01-29): 737,762.05\n\nHence, the total current liabilities initially were 0.00 and increased to 737,762.05 by the end date.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '737762.05'}}\n```",
