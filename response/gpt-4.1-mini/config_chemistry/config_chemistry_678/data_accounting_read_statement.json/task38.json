Since the value is negative, it indicates an increase in amounts owed.\n\nIf interpreting \"decrease\" strictly, that would mean the value is positive if accounts receivable decreased.\n\nBut since this line shows the change directly as \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with a negative value, the absolute decrease is the negative of this number.\n\nAlternatively, extracting the value as is because the value represents the net change.\n\nSince the problem wants the value of decrease, we take the line as is.\n\nHence, the relevant line item and value is:\n\n- Account: (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  \n- Value: -1604015.21\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-1604015.21\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-1604015.21\"}}\n```",
