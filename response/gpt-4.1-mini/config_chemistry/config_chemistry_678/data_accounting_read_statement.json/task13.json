These typically include fixed assets (property, plant, and equipment) and other long-term assets.\n\nFrom the problem's balance sheet:\n\n- Fixed Assets (non-current assets-related line item):\n  - Initial Amount: 5,000,000.00\n  - End Amount: 5,480,116.37\n\n- Total Non-current Assets line appears also:\n  - Initial Amount: 5,000,000.00\n  - End Amount: 5,434,370.58\n  \n  Note: The Total Non-current Assets amount is derived after subtracting accumulated depreciation and possibly includes other adjustments.\n\nSince the task asks for the total assets not expected to be realised or intended for sale or consumption in the operating cycle (non-current assets), we should use the \"Total Non-current Assets\" line values.\n\nHence:\n\n- Initial Value: 5,000,000.00\n- End Value: 5,434,370.58\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5434370.58'}}\n```",
