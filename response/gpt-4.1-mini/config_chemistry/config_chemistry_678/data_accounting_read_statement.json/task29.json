Identify the total income arising from ordinary activities in the income statement. Usually, this is represented by \"Total Revenue.\"\n\n2. From the input, \"Total Revenue\" is 5755241.17 on 2024-01-29.\n\n3. The constituent line item that makes up this \"Total Revenue\" is \"Main Business Revenue,\" which is also 5755241.17.\n\n4. The task requires decomposition into 1 component sub-item. Here, the sub-item is \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n\n5. For each sub-item, output its initial and final values. Here both values are the same (5755241.17).\n\nHence, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"5755241.17\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"5755241.17\"}}\n```\n\nNote: The placeholder for sub-item is named \"sub_items_sub_item value\" as per the example format.",
