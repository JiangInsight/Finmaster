The \"cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period\" usually refers to the opening balance of cash and cash equivalents from the cash flow statement, or the initial amounts of cash-related accounts from the balance sheet at the start date.\n\n2. From the balance sheet, the \"Initial_amount\" and \"Initial_date\" columns for Cash on Hand and Bank Deposits are:\n   - Cash on Hand: 3,000,000.00 as of 2023-12-31\n   - Bank Deposits: 5,000,000.00 as of 2023-12-31\n\n3. Similarly, the \"Total Current Assets\" initial amount is 8,000,000.00 as of 2023-12-31, which matches the sum of Cash on Hand and Bank Deposits.\n\n4. From the cash flow statement, under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\":\n   - Beginning Balance is reported as 8,000,000.00 as of 2024-01-29\n\n5. Therefore, the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period is 8,000,000.00.\n\nHence, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"8000000.00\"} }\n```",
