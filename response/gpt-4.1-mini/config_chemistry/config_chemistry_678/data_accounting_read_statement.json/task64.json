From the Balance Sheet:  \n   - The capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares, which is typically represented by \"Paid-in Capital\".  \n   \n2. From the Income Statement:  \n   - The end value of profit or loss for a period **before deducting tax expense**, which is commonly referred to as \"Profit Before Tax\".\n   \n3. From the Cash Flow Statement:  \n   - The **addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit** during the period. This corresponds to the change in \"Accounts Payable\". Since it's the addition \"owed\", we look for the line item representing increase in accounts payable, typically shown as \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step Extraction\n\n**1. Balance Sheet**  \n- \"Paid-in Capital\": End_amount = 13000000.00  \n\n**2. Income Statement**  \n- \"Profit Before Tax\": Amount = -1064617.58  \n\n**3. Cash Flow Statement**  \n- \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": Amount = 450000.00  \n\n---\n\n### Final JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"13000000.00\", \"value2\": \"-1064617.58\", \"value3\": \"450000.00\"}}\n```",
