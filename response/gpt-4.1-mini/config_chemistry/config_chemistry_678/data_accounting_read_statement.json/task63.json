The total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities (from the Income Statement).\n3. The net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the principal revenue-producing activities (from the Cash Flow Statement).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify the taxes accrued but not yet paid (Balance Sheet)\n\nLook for the line item related to taxes payable or accrued taxes.\n\n- From Balance Sheet:\n  - \"Taxes Payable\" = 287762.05\n\nSo, **value1 = \"287762.05\"**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify the total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities (Income Statement)\n\nThis generally corresponds to the main business revenue or total revenue.\n\n- From Income Statement:\n  - \"Main Business Revenue\" = 5755241.17\n  - \"Total Revenue\" = 5755241.17\n\nBoth are the same, so pick **value2 = \"5755241.17\"**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Identify the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities (Cash Flow Statement)\n\nLook for the net cash flow from operating activities.\n\n- From Cash Flow:\n  - \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" = -7724112.71\n\nSo, **value3 = \"-7724112.71\"**\n\n---\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '287762.05', 'value2': '5755241.17', 'value3': '-7724112.71'} }\n```",
