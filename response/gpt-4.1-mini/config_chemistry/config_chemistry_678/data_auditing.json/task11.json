Other records are consistent or without conflicts in the given problem snippet.\n\nNote: The problem description highlights identifying inconsistencies and providing corrected values. The only transaction here with mismatch between quantity, unit price, and recorded amount is `Purchase20231231001`. All others appear consistent or outside the explicitly given snippet to check.",
