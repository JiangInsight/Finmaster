Since purchase records do not show explicit \"tax_amount,\" and no separate purchase tax is given, assume tax on purchases is included in purchase amounts or not separately listed, so no input tax to subtract.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable**  \nGiven only sales tax amounts, the tax payable increases by total tax collected on sales.\n\n**Step 4: (Optional) If any tax payments recorded (like expenses), subtract them**  \nHere, no explicit tax payment records given; expenses don't specify tax payments.\n\n---\n\n**Calculate sum of tax_amount from sales in the data above**\n\nTo avoid error, let's sum the tax_amount from rows labeled as \"Sale\" (type column), extracting their tax_amount from the presented problem.\n\nSales with tax_amounts listed:\n\n- Sale20240102001: 2833.52  \n- Sale20240103003: 5622.23  \n- Sale20240103004: 13075.82  \n- Sale20240104006: 22069.15  \n- Sale20240104007: 11114.01  \n- Sale20240105008: 3489.71  \n- Sale20240105009: 6546.37  \n- Sale20240106012: 1946.54  \n- Sale20240107013: 1251.36  \n- Sale20240107014: 11397.44  \n- Sale20240108015: 20978.18  \n- Sale20240108016: 27791.78  \n- Sale20240109017: 2612.0  \n- Sale20240109018: 2715.26  \n- Sale20240110019: 4031.94  \n- Sale20240111021: 9496.18  \n- Sale20240112022: 12927.03  \n- Sale20240112023: 6865.38  \n- Sale20240113026: 2008.4  \n- Sale20240113027: 3006.38  \n- Sale20240114029: 12273.15  \n- Sale20240114030: 698.41  \n- Sale20240115032: 3082.36  \n- Sale20240116033: 10051.4  \n- Sale20240116034: 1131.81  \n- Sale20240117035: 1196.05  \n- Sale20240118038: 1149.15  \n- Sale20240119041: 2448.72  \n- Sale20240119042: 18996.08  \n- Sale20240120044: 2476.83  \n- Sale20240121046: 6957.65  \n- Sale20240121047: 603.7  \n- Sale20240122048: 1306.12  \n- Sale20240123049: 5965.49  \n- Sale20240123050: 17909.97  \n- Sale20240124051: 4897.75  \n- Sale20240124052: 2690.81  \n- Sale20240125053: 1306.9  \n- Sale20240125054: 5570.15  \n- Sale20240126056: 3192.67  \n- Sale20240128059: 2311.63  \n- Sale20240128060: 577.17  \n- Sale20240129061: 6863.69  \n\nNow we sum these values:\n\n2833.52  \n+ 5622.23 = 8455.75  \n+13075.82 = 21531.57  \n+22069.15 = 43600.72  \n+11114.01 = 54714.73  \n+ 3489.71 = 58204.44  \n+ 6546.37 = 64750.81  \n+ 1946.54 = 66697.35  \n+ 1251.36 = 67948.71  \n+11397.44 = 79346.15  \n+20978.18 = 100324.33  \n+27791.78 = 128116.11  \n+ 2612.00 = 130728.11  \n+ 2715.26 = 133443.37  \n+ 4031.94 = 137475.31  \n+ 9496.18 = 146971.49  \n+12927.03 = 159898.52  \n+ 6865.38 = 166763.90  \n+ 2008.40 = 168772.30  \n+ 3006.38 = 171778.68  \n+12273.15 = 184051.83  \n+ 698.41 = 184750.24  \n+ 3082.36 = 187832.60  \n+10051.40 = 197884.00  \n+ 1131.81 = 199015.81  \n+ 1196.05 = 200211.86  \n+ 1149.15 = 201361.01  \n+ 2448.72 = 203809.73  \n+18996.08 = 222805.81  \n+ 2476.83 = 225282.64  \n+ 6957.65 = 232240.29  \n+ 603.70 = 232844.00  \n+ 1306.12 = 234150.12  \n+ 5965.49 = 240115.61  \n+17909.97 = 258025.58  \n+ 4897.75 = 262923.33  \n+ 2690.81 = 265614.14  \n+ 1306.90 = 266921.04  \n+ 5570.15 = 272491.19  \n+ 3192.67 = 275683.86  \n+ 2311.63 = 277995.49  \n+   577.17 = 278572.66  \n+ 6863.69 = 285436.35  \n\n**Total tax amount from sales = 285436.35**\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify input tax on purchases to subtract**  \nPurchase records do not provide explicit tax_amount fields.
