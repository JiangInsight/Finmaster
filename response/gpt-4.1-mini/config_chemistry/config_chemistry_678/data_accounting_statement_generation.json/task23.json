These usually are entries with \"Purchase\" type related to products, excluding Fixed Assets.\n\n2. **Identify sales COGS** - Sales entries have a \"cost_amount\" field which shows the cost of the sold goods. Summing up these \"cost_amount\" values gives us the total cost of goods sold.\n\n3. Generally, the COGS reported in an income statement equals the sum of the cost of goods sold related to the sales during the period, i.e., sum of the cost_amount in sales records.\n\nHere, the task and example indicate the main way to get COGS is summing the cost_amount in the Sale transactions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Extract Sale Transactions and sum their cost_amount\n\nFrom \"Sale\" types entries (type == \"Sale\"):\n\nWe consider all sale entries and sum their cost_amount.\n\nLet's sum cost_amount from all sales line items:\n\nFrom the given data, among the Sale rows:\n\n- Sale20240102001: cost_amount = 50000.0\n- Sale20240103003: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240103004: cost_amount = 200000.0\n- Sale20240104006: cost_amount = 400000.0\n- Sale20240104007: cost_amount = 200000.0\n- Sale20240105008: cost_amount = 50000.0\n- Sale20240105009: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240106012: cost_amount = 30000.0\n- Sale20240107013: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240107014: cost_amount = 200000.0\n- Sale20240108015: cost_amount = 300000.0\n- Sale20240108016: cost_amount = 500000.0\n- Sale20240109017: cost_amount = 40000.0\n- Sale20240109018: cost_amount = 40000.0\n- Sale20240110019: cost_amount = 60000.0\n- Sale20240111021: cost_amount = 150000.0\n- Sale20240112022: cost_amount = 200000.0\n- Sale20240112023: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240113026: cost_amount = 30000.0\n- Sale20240113027: cost_amount = 50000.0\n- Sale20240114029: cost_amount = 200000.0\n- Sale20240114030: cost_amount = 10000.0\n- Sale20240115032: cost_amount = 50000.0\n- Sale20240116033: cost_amount = 150000.0\n- Sale20240116034: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240117035: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240118038: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240119041: cost_amount = 40000.0\n- Sale20240119042: cost_amount = 300000.0\n- Sale20240120044: cost_amount = 40000.0\n- Sale20240121046: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240121047: cost_amount = 10000.0\n- Sale20240122048: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240123049: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240123050: cost_amount = 300000.0\n- Sale20240124051: cost_amount = 80000.0\n- Sale20240124052: cost_amount = 40000.0\n- Sale20240125053: cost_amount = 20000.0\n- Sale20240125054: cost_amount = 100000.0\n- Sale20240126056: cost_amount = 50000.0\n- Sale20240129061: cost_amount = 100000.0\n\n---\n\n**Add all these cost_amounts:**\n\nLet's sum them carefully:\n\n50000 + 100000 + 200000 + 400000 + 200000 + 50000 + 100000 + 30000 + 20000 + 200000 + 300000 + 500000 + 40000 + 40000 + 60000 + 150000 + 200000 + 100000 + 30000 + 50000 + 200000 + 10000 + 50000 + 150000 + 20000 + 20000 + 20000 + 40000 + 300000 + 40000 + 100000 + 10000 + 20000 + 100000 + 300000 + 80000 + 40000 + 20000 + 100000 + 50000 + 100000 = ?\n\nCompute in parts:\n\nGroup1 = 50000 + 100000 + 200000 + 400000 + 200000 = 950000  \nGroup2 = 50000 + 100000 + 30000 + 20000 + 200000 = 400000  \nGroup3 = 300000 + 500000 + 40000 + 40000 + 60000 = 940000  \nGroup4 = 150000 + 200000 + 100000 + 30000 + 50000 = 530000  \nGroup5 = 200000 + 10000 + 50000 + 150000 + 20000 = 430000  \nGroup6 = 20000 + 20000 + 40000 + 300000 + 40000 = 420000  \nGroup7 = 100000 + 10000 + 20000 + 100000 + 300000 = 530000  \nGroup8 = 80000 + 40000 + 20000 + 100000 + 50000 + 100000 = 390000\n\nNow sum groups:\n\n950000 + 400000 = 1,350,000  \n1,350,000 + 940,000 = 2,290,000  \n2,290,000 + 530,000 = 2,820,000  \n2,820,000 + 430,000 = 3,250,000  \n3,250,000 + 420,000 = 3,670,000  \n3,670,000 + 530,000 = 4,200,000  \n4,200,000 + 390,000 = 4,590,000\n\n---\n\nWait, the final sum is 4,590,000.\n\nCross-check addition:\n\nSum more directly:\n\nFirst add all values:\n\n50000  \n+100000 = 150000  \n+200000 = 350000  \n+400000 = 750000  \n+200000 = 950000  \n+50000 = 1,000,000  \n+100000 = 1,100,000  \n+30000 = 1,130,000  \n+20000 = 1,150,000  \n+200000 = 1,350,000  \n+300000 = 1,650,000  \n+500000 = 2,150,000  \n+40000 = 2,190,000  \n+40000 = 2,230,000  \n+60000 = 2,290,000  \n+150000 = 2,440,000  \n+200000 = 2,640,000  \n+100000 = 2,740,000  \n+30000 = 2,770,000  \n+50000 = 2,820,000  \n+200000 = 3,020,000  \n+10000 = 3,030,000  \n+50000 = 3,080,000  \n+150000 = 3,230,000  \n+20000 = 3,250,000  \n+20000 = 3,270,000  \n+20000 = 3,290,000  \n+40000 = 3,330,000  \n+300000 = 3,630,000  \n+40000 = 3,670,000  \n+100000 = 3,770,000  \n+10000 = 3,780,000  \n+20000 = 3,800,000  \n+100000=3,900,000  \n+300000=4,200,000  \n+80000=4,280,000  \n+40000=4,320,000  \n+20000=4,340,000  \n+100000=4,440,000  \n+50000=4,490,000  \n+100000=4,590,000\n\nConfirmed total cost_amount from sales = 4,590,000.00\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Prepare final cost of goods sold as sum of cost_amount from sales = 4,590,000.00\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"4590000.00\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n# Explanation:\n\nThe Cost of Goods Sold is the total cost value of items actually sold during the period. This is the sum of the \"cost_amount\" for sales transactions as demonstrated above. Administrative, financial expenses and other expense types are not included in COGS. Similarly, purchases represent inventory inflows but COGS reflects cost of inventory sold.\n\nTherefore, final calculated COGS is **4,590,000.00**.",
