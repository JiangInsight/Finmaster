Identify the initial Interest Receivables balance at the start of the period (from the \"Initial\" or earliest records for Interest Receivables).\n2. Identify the final Interest Receivables balance at the end of the period (from the latest Interest Receivables record).\n3. Calculate the difference: Final balance - Initial balance.\n   - If the difference is positive, interest receivable has increased (cash outflow, so it will show as a negative amount in cash flow).\n   - If the difference is negative, interest receivable has decreased (cash inflow, so it will show as a positive amount in cash flow).\n\n---\n\nLooking into the provided data for Interest Receivables:\n\n- Earliest Interest Receivable amount (2024-01-01): 373.80 (rounded from 373.79999999999995)\n- Latest Interest Receivable amount (2024-01-29): 0.21422211000000047\n\nNote that all entries labeled Interest Receivables are \"Unpaid\" and tagged as Interest receviable.\n\nCalculation:\n\nFinal Interest Receivable = 0.21422211  \nInitial Interest Receivable = 373.79999999999995  \n\nChange = Final - Initial = 0.21422211 - 373.79999999999995 = -373.58577789\n\nThis means Interest Receivables decreased by approximately 373.59.\n\n---\n\nTherefore,\n\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-373.59'}}\n\n# Rounded to two decimals for presentation.",
