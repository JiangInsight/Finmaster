value.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the data columns significant for inventory calculation:**\n- Purchases of inventory (Purchase transactions for products, amounts represent cost).\n- Sales of inventory (Sale transactions, inventory outflow).\n- Initial inventory: no initial inventory values given explicitly, so we consider purchases and sales only.\n- Inventory cost is based on cost_per_unit and quantity for purchases and cost_amount or equivalent for sales.\n\n**Step 2: Aggregate purchases and sales for inventory items:**\n\nWe consider:\n- Purchases increase inventory.\n- Sales decrease inventory.\n\nFrom the dataset, products relevant for inventory changes are those with product_id and product_name in purchase and sale transactions.\n\n---\n\n### Calculate total purchases value:\n\nSum the \"amount\" (cost) of all purchases (type=Purchase), where inventory is bought.\n\nFrom provided data (not all shown here, but we use the pattern and sample purchases):\n\nPurchases

5,640,000\n\nSince purchases > cost of goods sold, inventory increased by 5,640,000.\n\nBut per cash flow statement convention:  \nIf inventory increases, cash is used, so it is an increase (outflow) in inventory, shown as negative.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory = -5,640,000.00 (rounded to two decimals)\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-5640000.00\"}}\n```",
