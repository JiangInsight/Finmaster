This represents the total cost of goods purchased.\n\nStep 4: According to the instruction and example, the \"Total Cost\" item corresponds to the sum of purchases. Other expenses (Administrative, Sales, Financial Expenses) and Depreciation relate to operating expenses and are not included in the \"Total Cost\" (cost of goods sold or cost item) for the income statement.\n\nHence:\n\n{\"solution\": {'Total Cost': '10230000.00'}}\n\n# Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Cost\": \"10230000.00\"} }\n```",
