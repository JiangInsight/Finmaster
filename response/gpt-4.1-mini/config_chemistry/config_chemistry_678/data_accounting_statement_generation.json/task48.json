                        "content": "To calculate the final net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the cash flow statement, we need to consider all cash inflows and outflows that affect cash and cash equivalents. Generally, the cash flow statement includes:\n\n- Operating activities: Cash received from customers and cash paid for expenses, purchases, etc.\n- Investing activities: Purchase or sale of fixed assets (cash impact only if paid or received in cash/bank transfer)\n- Financing activities: Loans, repayments, equity injections, dividends (not specified here)\n- Non-cash items (like depreciation, interest receivables unpaid) do not affect cash.\n\nFrom the given table, we identify:\n\n**Step 1: Initial Cash and Bank balances**\n\n- Initial cash deposit: 3,000,000.0 (assumed cash)\n- Initial bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n- These are opening balances, so they won't count to increase/decrease.\n\n**Step 2: Cash and Bank inflows:**\n\n- Sales paid in cash or bank (payment_method empty or \"Cash\" or bank transfer where relevant)\n- Transfers: Cash to bank transfer or Bank to cash transfer affects same cash + bank but net zero effect on total cash+cash equivalents.\n- Bank transfers for purchases are cash equivalents (bank)\n- Sale transactions with \"Cash\" payment increase cash.\n- Sale transactions unpaid do NOT increase cash now.\n- Bank to cash transfer increases cash, cash to bank decreases cash, total combined transfers zero effect on net cash.\n\n**Step 3: Cash and Bank outflows:**\n\n- Purchases paid in cash or bank transfer reduce cash/bank.\n- Expenses paid in cash reduce cash.\n- Fixed assets purchase paid in bank transfer reduces bank.\n- Interest receivables unpaid do NOT impact cash.\n- Depreciation is non-cash expense, ignore.\n- Transfer between cash and bank no net impact on total.\n\n**Step 4: Sum all cash inflows and cash outflows from transactions with payment_method = \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" affecting cash+cash equivalents**\n\n-- Detail:\n\n**Cash inflows:**\n\n- Sales received paid in cash: Only those with payment_method empty or \"Cash\" and payment/receipt_status \"Paid\".\n- Example: Sale on 2024-01-02 (id Sale20240102001) Paid, payment_method empty, amount 56670.46, receive_method Cash -> cash inflow 56,670.46\n- Similarly, extract all \"Sale\" with Paid and payment_method indicating cash equivalent receipts.\n\n**Cash outflows:**\n\n- Purchases paid with \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\"\n- Expenses paid by \"Cash\"\n- Fixed assets purchase paid by \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\"\n\n**Transfers:**\n\n- Transfers between cash and bank do not affect total cash+c.e.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation (Stepwise calculation):\n\n1. **Sum of cash receipts (cash inflows):**\n\nSum amounts of Sale rows where payment/receipt_status is \"Paid\" AND receive_method is \"Cash\" (or if payment_method is blank or Cash with Paid status).\n\n2. **Sum of cash payments (cash outflows):**\n\nSum amounts of:\n\n- Purchase with payment_method \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" and \"Paid\"\n- Expenses with payment_method \"Cash\" and \"Paid\"\n- Fixed Assets purchase with payment_method \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" and \"Paid\"\n\n3. **Transfers between cash and bank:**\n\n- These are internal movements, net zero overall.\n\n4. **Calculate net increase = (Total cash inflows) -
