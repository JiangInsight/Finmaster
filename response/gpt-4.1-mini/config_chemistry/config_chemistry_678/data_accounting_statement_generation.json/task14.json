                        "content": "To calculate the current liabilities on the balance sheet (initial and final amounts), we focus primarily on accounts payable and unpaid purchases or expenses â€” items that represent obligations to pay within one year.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Current Liabilities**\n\n- Look at the initial records dated 2023-12-31.\n\n- Entries indicate Cash, Bank deposit, and Fixed Assets. No unpaid purchases or accounts payable noted as initial liabilities.\n\n- Therefore, initial current liabilities = 0.00\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Final Current Liabilities**\n\n- Identify all unpaid purchases and expenses as of the end date (latest date): 2024-01-29 and earlier.\n\n- Unpaid purchases:  \n  - Filter by \"payment/receipt_status\" = \"Unpaid\" and type = Purchase or purchases with payment method \"Account Payable\".\n\n- From the data:\n\n  Unpaid purchases and amounts:  \n  - Purchase20231231003: 450,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)  \n  - Purchase20231231011: 900,000.0 (Paid, so exclude)  \n  - Purchase20231231008: 380,000.0 (Paid, exclude)  \n  - Purchase20231231007: 80,000.0 (Paid, exclude)  \n  - Purchase20231231004: 130,000.0 (Paid, exclude)  \n  - Purchase20231231012: 380,000.0 (Paid, exclude)  \n  - Purchase20231231013: 2,100,000.0 (Paid, exclude)  \n  - Purchase20231231009: 220,000.0 (Paid, exclude)  \n  - Purchase20231231005: 70,000.0 (Paid, exclude)  \n  - Purchase20231231006: 220,000.0 (Paid, exclude)  \n  - Purchase20231231002: 3,000,000.0 (Paid)  \n  - Purchase20231231001: 800,000.0 Paid  \n  - Purchase20231231003: 450,000.0 Unpaid Account Payable - this counts for liabilities\n\n  Also, from \"payment/receipt_status\" Unpaid for Purchase entries:\n\n  Only Purchase20231231003 really marked as unpaid with Account Payable.\n\n- Additionally check unpaid \"Expense\" or other liabilities but common current liabilities relate mainly to unpaid purchases.\n\n- Check for unpaid items with payment method \"Account Payable\": Only Purchase20231231003 qualifies.\n\nSo current liabilities from purchases = 450,000.00\n\n- Also consider unpaid interest receivables are assets (amounts receivable), so ignore.\n\n- Also, \"payment/receipt_status\" = \"Unpaid\" for other purchases:\n\n  None seen except Purchase20231231003 as above.\n\n- Check for any other unpaid liabilities (like unpaid financial expenses marked as unpaid), there is no \"Unpaid\" Expenses records in the problem data, all expenses are marked paid.\n\n- Check for any \"Account Payable\" entries with Unpaid status in \"payment_method\":\n\n  No other unpaid purchases.\n\n- Check unpaid purchases with unpaid status and amount:\n\n  Purchase20231231003 = 450,000.0\n\nFurthermore, in the example solution provided at the top, \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\" was 1,861,550.92 which was sum of unpaid \"Account Payable\" purchases.\n\nLet's review the purchases again for unpaid with \"Account Payable\":\n\n- Purchase20231231003 - 450,000.0 (unpaid) [yes]\n\n- Purchase20231231010 (1500000) - Paid\n\n- Purchase20231231011 (900,000) - Paid\n\n- Purchase20231231012 (380,000) - Paid\n\n- Purchase20231231013 (2100000) - Paid\n\n- Purchase20231231009 (220,000) - Paid\n\n- Purchase20231231008 (380,000) - Paid\n\n- Purchase20231231007 (80,000) - Paid\n\n- Purchase20231231004 (130,000) - Paid\n\n- Purchase20231231005 (70,000) - Paid\n\n- Purchase20231231006 (220,000) - Paid\n\n- Purchase20231231002 (3,000,000) - Paid\n\n- Purchase20231231001 (800,000) - Paid\n\nNo other unpaid purchases found at first glance except Purchase20231231003.\n\nWait: Look for \"payment/receipt_status\" = \"Unpaid\" in purchases: Only Purchase20231231003 is \"Unpaid\".\n\nNext, check purchases in the problem data that have \"payment/receipt_status\" = \"Unpaid\":\n\n- Purchase20231231003 - 450,000.0\n\n- Purchase20231231011 - Paid\n\nBut wait, in the problem data, we also have:\n\n- Purchase20231231003 is Unpaid, Account Payable\n\n- Purchase20231231003 | Unpaid | 50000 cost_per_unit * 9 quantity = total 450,000 (matches amount)\n\nAny other unpaid purchases? Not clearly found.\n\nTherefore, total unpaid purchases = 450,000.00\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Other possible current liabilities**\n\nAre there other current liabilities such as accrued expenses, unpaid financial expenses, or similar?\n\n- Expenses are generally marked \"Paid\", no \"Unpaid\" expenses.\n\n- Interest receivables are assets, so ignore.\n\n- Check if any purchases combined with \"Account Payable\" status unpaid.\n\n- No other such purchases.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Check Accounts Payable payment method field**\n\nThere is one purchase with Payment Method \"Account Payable\" and \"Unpaid\": Purchase20231231003 (450,000).\n\nIs there any other transaction with such details?\n\nThere is no other purchase with \"Unpaid\" status and \"Account Payable\" payment method.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Sum up initial and final values**\n\n- Initial Current Liabilities = 0.00\n\n- Final Current Liabilities = sum of unpaid purchases with Account Payable = 450,000.00\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\n\n- Total Current Liabilities Initial Value: 0.00\n\n- Total Current Liabilities End Value: 450,000.00\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"450000.00\"}}\n```",
