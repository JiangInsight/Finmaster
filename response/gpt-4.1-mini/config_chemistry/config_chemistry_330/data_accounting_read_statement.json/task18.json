Cash held by the entity for use in day-to-day operations:\n   - Here, \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" are typical cash accounts.\n   - From the example and instructions, it seems the first line item related to cash is taken as \"Cash on Hand\".\n\n2. Tangible items held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, rental to others, or for administrative purposes:\n   - This corresponds to \"Fixed Assets\".\n\n3. Amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid:\n   - This corresponds to \"Taxes Payable\".\n\nNow, from the given problem data, we extract the values of these three items in their initial and end amounts.\n\nLine items and their values:\n\n- Cash on Hand: Initial_amount = 3000000.00, End_amount = 145666.48\n- Fixed Assets: Initial_amount = 5000000.00, End_amount = 7265288.42\n- Taxes Payable: Initial_amount = 0.00, End_amount = 354996.05\n\nWe maintain the original line item order as given in the table.\n\nHence the output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value1\": \"3000000.00\", \"end valu1\": \"145666.48\", \"initial value2\": \"5000000.00\", \"end valu2\": \"7265288.42\", \"initial value3\": \"0.00\", \"end valu3\": \"354996.05\"}}\n```",
