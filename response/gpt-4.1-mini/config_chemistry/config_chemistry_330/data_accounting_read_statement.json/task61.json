The cost incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods/services to customers.\n   - These kinds of costs are typically represented under operating expenses related to sales and administration.\n   - Given the line items, the closest match is the \"Selling Expenses\" in the Income Statement because selling expenses are directly related to the costs of delivering goods/services and securing orders.\n\n2. The cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.\n   - This is usually found in the Cash Flow Statement under investing activities.\n   - Here, it is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\n\nFrom the input:\n\n### Income Statement\n- Selling Expenses: 395393.99\n\n### Cash Flow Statement\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 2265288.42\n\nHence,\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '395393.99', 'value2': '2265288.42'}}\n```",
