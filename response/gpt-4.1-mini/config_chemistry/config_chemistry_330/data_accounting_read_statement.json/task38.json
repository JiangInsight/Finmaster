But the problem asks specifically for the value of the decrease in amounts owed to the entity, which is captured by the sign and meaning of this line.\n\nBut according to the nature of cash flow statements:\n- A negative value for \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" means accounts receivable increased (more owed to entity), so cash flow is reduced.\n- A positive value means accounts receivable decreased (less owed), so cash flow is increased.\n\nSince the value given is negative, it signals an increase in accounts receivable (amounts owed to the entity increased). However, the task asks to identify and extract the decrease, which in this case would be the positive values in this line item.\n\nGiven only one line for Accounts Receivable, the decrease value is represented by the line being negative, meaning, in fact, there was no decrease but rather an increase.\n\nThe prompt example shows the value is extracted directly from the line, regardless of sign.\n\nTherefore, we are to extract the value as is, which is -3558301.64.\n\nHence, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-3558301.64\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-3558301.64\"}}\n```",
