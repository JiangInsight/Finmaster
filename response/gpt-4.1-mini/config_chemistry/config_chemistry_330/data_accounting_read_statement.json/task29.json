The line item that typically represents total income from ordinary activities in this statement is \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue\". Both have the same value of 7099920.95.\n\n3. The task requires extracting the total income along with its constituent line items, also decomposed into 1 component sub-item originating from the input statement.\n\n4. The constituent line item for \"Total Revenue\" here is \"Main Business Revenue\" with the same value since the amounts are equal.\n\n5. For the sub-items, we must pick one which originates from the income statement and composes the total income item.\n\n6. The \"Main Business Revenue\" is both a constituent item and sub-item of \"Total Revenue\".\n\nHence, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"7099920.95\", \"Main Business Revenue_sub_item value\": \"7099920.95\"}}\n```",
