These are typically the \"Current Liabilities.\"\n\nFrom the problem data:\n\n- Accounts Payable (typically current liability):\n  - Initial_amount: 0.00\n  - End_amount: 2,700,000.00\n\n- Taxes Payable (current liability):\n  - Initial_amount: 0.00\n  - End_amount: 354,996.05\n\n- Total Current Liabilities:\n  - Initial_amount: 0.00\n  - End_amount: 3,054,996.05\n\nTherefore, the total amount of liabilities expected to be settled in the normal course of operations is the Total Current Liabilities line, which is initially 0.00 and ends at 3,054,996.05.\n\nHence:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3054996.05'} }\n```",
