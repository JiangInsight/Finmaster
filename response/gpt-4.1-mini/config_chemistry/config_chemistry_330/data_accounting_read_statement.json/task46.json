                        "content": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The item to identify is the \"net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends.\"\n\n2. Typically, this corresponds to \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section.\n\n3. From the input, under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" we have:\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 2,265,288.42\n   - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -2,265,288.42\n\n4. The negative net cash flow from investing activities (-2,265,288.42) indicates a net cash outflow in investing activities, mainly from purchasing fixed assets.\n\n5. The task requires outputting the final value (net cash flow from investing activities) and decomposing it into 1 component sub-item, also originating from the input statement.\n\n6. The sub-item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with amount 2,265,288.42.\n\n(Note: The Purchase of Fixed Assets amount in the problem is positive 2,265,288.42, but in cash flow statement purchase is a cash outflow and should be considered negative when calculating net cash flows. The net cash flow from investing activities is -2,265,288.42, confirming this.)\n\n7. Thus, the final value should be the net cash flow from investing activities: -2,265,288.42\n\n8. The one sub-item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with value 2,265,288.42 (absolute value).\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-2265288.42\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"2265288.42\"}}\n```\n\n# Final output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-2265288.42\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"2265288.42\"}}\n```",
