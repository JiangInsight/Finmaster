Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life = Depreciation  \n   From the data: Depreciation = 45765.70\n\n2. Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period  \n   This corresponds to (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  \n   From the data: (Increase) Decrease in Inventory = -3760000.00\n\n3. Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities related to acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments (not in cash equivalents) and receipt of interest and dividends  \n   This is Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  \n   From the data: Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -2265288.42\n\n4.
