Look at the Balance Sheet section for a line item related to interest accrued or interest receivable.  \n   - There is an \"Interest Receivable\" account.\n\n2. Extract the initial and end values for \"Interest Receivable\":\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00 (at 2023-12-31)  \n   - End_amount: 1731.44 (at 2024-01-29)\n\n3. Cross-checking with the Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement, the \"Interest Income\" and \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" values match the same amount (1731.44), confirming that this is the relevant figure.\n\nHence:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"1731.44\"}}\n```\n\nThis provides the interest accrued but not yet received at the beginning and end of the period.",
