                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to identify and extract three specific values from the income statement:\n\n1. Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities  \n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period  \n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole  \n\nStep-by-step:\n\n- Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities: Usually, this corresponds to \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue\". Here, both show the same amount, choose \"Total Revenue\" since it represents total income.\n\n- Carrying amount of inventories sold: This is commonly reflected as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" or \"Cost of Sales\". Here, the line \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with amount 5,540,000.00 matches.\n\n- Costs of general management and administration of the entity: This is \"Administrative Expenses\", which is 1,529,708.19.\n\nThe order should match line item order in the input:\n\nGiven the input order:\n\n1. Main Business Revenue: 7,099,920.95  \n2. Total Revenue: 7,099,920.95  \n3. Cost of Goods Sold: 5,540,000.00  \n4. Total Cost: 5,540,000.00  \n5. Gross Profit: 1,559,920.95  \n6. Administrative Expenses: 1,529,708.19  \n\nThe three line items appear in this order:  \n- Total Revenue (2nd line)  \n- Cost of Goods Sold (3rd line)  \n- Administrative Expenses (6th line)\n\nThus, the output values are:\n\n- value1 = 7099920.95  \n- value2 = 5540000.00  \n- value3 = 1529708.19  \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '7099920.95', 'value2': '5540000.00', 'value3': '1529708.19'}}\n```",
