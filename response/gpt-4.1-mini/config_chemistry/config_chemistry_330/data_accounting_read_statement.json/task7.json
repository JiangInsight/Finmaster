It starts at 0.00 and ends at 45765.70, which indicates depreciation expense during the period.\n\nStep 4: Retained Earnings start at 0.00 and end at -1175062.19, indicating accumulated net losses (expense impact). But since task focuses on \"expense in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income,\" accumulated depreciation is a more direct expense-related line item.\n\nHence, the line item to extract is \"Accumulated Depreciation\" with initial value 0.00 and final value 45765.70.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"45765.70\"}}\n```\n",
