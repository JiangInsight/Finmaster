                        "content": "Step 1: Identify the line items related to costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services.\n\n- Costs to secure customer orders generally fall under \"Selling Expenses\" because selling expenses include sales commissions, advertising, marketing, and other costs directly tied to obtaining customer orders.\n- Costs to deliver goods and services to customers are generally included in \"Cost of Goods Sold\" because COGS reflect the direct costs attributable to the production and delivery of goods or services.\n\nStep 2: Extract the relevant values from the problem statement.\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 5,540,000.00\n- Selling Expenses = 395,393.99\n\nSince the instruction is to identify and extract the specific line items and their values:\n\n- Costs to secure customer orders: Selling Expenses = 395,393.99\n- Costs to deliver goods and services: Cost of Goods Sold = 5,540,000.00\n\nHowever, in the example provided, only the \"Selling Expenses\" line was identified as the requested cost value (likely because \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is often considered a separate 'cost of sales' rather than an expense incurred securing orders).\n\nThe problem states: \"Based on the income statement, identify and extract the specific line items and value of costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers\"\n\nTherefore, both line items are relevant:\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 5,540,000.00 (delivery of goods/services)\n- Selling Expenses: 395,393.99 (costs to secure customer orders)\n\nThus the solution should reflect both these line items and their values.\n\nStep 3: Format in the required json solution.\n\nSince the example only shows one value (likely for simplification), if we are to match that style and only provide one value, the best fit would be \"Selling Expenses\" (costs incurred to secure customer orders).\n\nAlternatively, to strictly satisfy the request, present both values.\n\nBut given the example format is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'value': '493854.67'}}\n\nThat suggests only one value should be returned.\n\nSince the problem asks for both sets of costs, but the example points towards extracting the cost \"to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services\" in a single value, possibly summed or only \"Selling Expenses\".\n\nBecause the example answer only extracts the \"Selling Expenses\" amount, we assume the task wants the selling expenses only (costs to secure orders).\n\nTherefore, answer with the selling expenses amount.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"solution\": {'value': '395393.99'}}\n\n# Final output:  \n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '395393.99'}}\n```",
