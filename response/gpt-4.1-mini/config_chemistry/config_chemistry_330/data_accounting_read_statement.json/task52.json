Usually, this line item is named \"Paid-in Capital,\" \"Share Capital,\" or something similar on the balance sheet.\n\n2. Looking at the provided balance sheet:\n   - The \"Paid-in Capital\" line item shows:\n     - Initial_amount: 13000000.00 on 2023-12-31\n     - End_amount: 13000000.00 on 2024-01-29\n\n3. The initial value and the end value of paid-in capital are both 13,000,000.00, meaning there has been no change in capital contributed by shareholders during the period.\n\n4. No other line item appears to represent capital contributed by shareholders.\n\nHence, the initial and end values of capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares are both 13,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"13000000.00\", \"end value\": \"13000000.00\"}}\n```",
