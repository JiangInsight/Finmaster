Based on example format and instructions, we should extract only one line item for cash held for day-to-day operations.\n\nSince both \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" are cash accounts commonly available, I will choose both line items and sum them to get the total cash available.\n\nBut based on the example, only \"Cash on Hand\" is returned as solution.\n\nReconsidering the instruction: \"identify and extract the specific line items and value of cash held by an entity that is available for use in its day-to-day operations, including initial and final value\"\n\nSince in examples, only \"Cash on Hand\" value was extracted, I will use the \"Cash on Hand\" line for the solution.\n\nHence,\n\nInitial value = 3,000,000.00  \nEnd value = 145,666.48  \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"3000000.00\", \"end value\": \"145666.48\"}}\n```",
