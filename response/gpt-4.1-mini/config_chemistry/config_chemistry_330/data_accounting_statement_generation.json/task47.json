\"Cash to bank transfer\" decreases cash\n  - \"Bank to cash transfer\" increases cash\n- Ignore unpaid transactions or those not paid via cash (like Bank Transfer, Account Payable, Account Receivable, etc.)\n- Ignore fixed assets purchase (not cash equivalents), even if paid by Bank Transfer or Cash.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Identify and sum cash inflows:\n\n- **Sales (type \"Sale\") with**:\n  - payment_method = \"Cash\"\n  - payment/receipt_status = \"Paid\"\n\n- From the problem rows, relevant sales are:\n\nExtract such sales and sum their \"amount\":\n\nPartial listing of such sales (Paid by Cash -

cash decreases\n\nTransfers labeled \"Bank to cash transfer\" - cash increases\n\nNet effect of transfers adjusts cash only.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Detailed calculation approach\n\n- Start with Initial Cash: 3,000,000.0\n- Add cash sales (paid in Cash)\n- Add bank deposits (initial 5,000,000) ignored because bank deposit not cash equivalents (usually bank is cash equivalents)\n- Subtract expenses paid by Cash\n- Subtract purchases paid by Cash\n- Adjust for transfers between cash and bank (net outflows from cash)\n- Ignore unpaid transactions and transactions via bank transfer or account payable or receivable for cash calculation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Extract relevant transactions and calculate\n\n**Starting cash:** 3,000,000.0\n\n**Cash inflows:**\n\nSales paid in cash:\n\n- Sale20240104005: 110,304.98 (Cash)\n- Sale20240104006: 261,696.18 (Cash)\n- Sale20240105008: 114,973.05 (Cash)\n- Sale20240105009: 33,923.61 (Cash)\n- Sale20240106010: 110,506.16 (Cash)\n- Sale20240106011: 33,339.15 (Cash)\n- Sale20240113021: 304,821.85 (Cash)\n- Sale20240123043: 269,306.76 (Cash)\n- Sale20240123044: 52,567.84 (Cash)\n- Sale20240120038: 68,078.00 (Cash)\n- Sale20240120039: 13,128.95 (Cash)\n- Sale20240128052: 105,539.92 (Cash)\n- Sale20240127049: 173,035.77 (Cash)\n- Sale20240127050: 40,224.21 (Cash)\n- Sale20240129054: 35,752.38 (Cash)\n- Sale20240129055: 231,897.32 (Cash)\n- Sale20240130056: 128,279.10 (Cash)\n- Sale20240130057: 74,300.25 (Cash)\n\nSum these:\n\n110,304.98 + 261,696.18 + 114,973.05 + 33,923.61 + 110,506.16 + 33,339.15 + 304,821.85 + 269,306.76 + 52,567.84 + 68,078.00 + 13,128.95 + 105,539.92 + 173,035.77 + 40,224.21 + 35,752.38 + 231,897.32 + 128,279.10 + 74,300.25\n\nCalculate:\n\n- 110,304.98 + 261,696.18 = 372,001.16\n- +114,973.05 = 486,974.21\n- +33,923.61 = 520,897.82\n- +110,506.16 = 631,403.98\n- +33,339.15 = 664,743.13\n- +304,821.85 = 969,564.98\n- +269,306.76 = 1,238,871.74\n- +52,567.84 = 1,291,439.58\n- +68,078.00 = 1,359,517.58\n- +13,128.95 = 1,372,646.53\n- +105,539.92 = 1,478,186.45\n- +173,035.77 = 1,651,222.22\n- +40,224.21 = 1,691,446.43\n- +35,752.38 = 1,727,198.81\n- +231,897.32 = 1,959,096.13\n- +128,279.10 = 2,087,375.23\n- +74,300.25 = 2,161,675.48\n\n**Total cash sales receipts = 2,161,675.48**\n\n---\n\n**Cash outflows:**\n\n- Purchase paid by Cash:\n\nLook for Purchase type with payment_method = Cash and Paid status:\n\n1.
