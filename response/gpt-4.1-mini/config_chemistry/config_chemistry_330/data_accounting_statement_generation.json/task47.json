\"Cash to bank transfer\" decreases cash\n  - \"Bank to cash transfer\" increases cash\n- Ignore unpaid transactions or those not paid via cash (like Bank Transfer, Account Payable, Account Receivable, etc.)\n- Ignore fixed assets purchase (not cash equivalents), even if paid by Bank Transfer or Cash.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Identify and sum cash inflows:\n\n- **Sales (type \"Sale\") with**:\n  -
