                        "content": "To calculate the final accounts payable item (Increase or Decrease in Accounts Payable) for the cash flow statement, the standard approach is:\n\n**Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable = Ending accounts payable balance - Beginning accounts payable balance**\n\nGiven we have detailed transactions we need to:\n\n1. Identify the initial (beginning) accounts payable balance.\n2. Identify purchases on credit (Unpaid purchases) that increase accounts payable.\n3. Identify payment of accounts payable (purchases marked as Paid with payment methods other than \"Account Payable\" or 'Unpaid' status).\n4. Calculate the ending accounts payable balance as the net unpaid purchases.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Beginning Accounts Payable\n\n- Initial balances are given only for Cash deposit, Bank deposit, and Fixed Assets.\n- There is no explicit initial accounts payable balance given, so we assume zero at the start **(or from the data, but no unpaid purchase at initial date)**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find Total Purchases marked as **Unpaid**\n\nFrom the data rows with type \"Purchase\" and payment/receipt_status as \"Unpaid\" or payment_method as \"Account Payable\":\n\n- Purchase20231231005: amount 2,700,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable\n- Purchase20231231010: amount 2,400,000.0, Paid (skip)\n- Purchase20231231005 is specifically Unpaid and Account Payable, so that adds to accounts payable.\n\nLooking through the data only Purchase20231231005 stands out as Unpaid and Account Payable for 2,700,000.\n\nAlso:\n\n- Purchase20231231025 (not present)\n- Purchase20231231025 is not in data.\n\nSo only one purchase for 2,700,000 is Unpaid.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Sum purchases marked as Paid\n\nPurchases with payment/receipt_status as \"Paid\" reduce accounts payable since they are paid off:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 540,000 Paid - Bank Transfer (paid)\n- Purchase20231231002: 2,500,000 Paid - Bank Transfer (paid)\n- Purchase20231231003: 280,000 Paid - Bank Transfer (paid)\n- Purchase20231231004: 1,200,000 Paid - Cash (paid)\n- Purchase20231231006: 520,000 Paid - Bank Transfer (paid)\n- Purchase20231231007: 1,300,000 Paid - Bank Transfer (paid)\n- Purchase20231231008: 120,000 Paid - Cash (paid)\n- Purchase20231231009: 140,000 Paid - Cash (paid)\n- Purchase20231231011: 1,450,000 Paid - Bank Transfer (paid)\n\nSumming these:\n\n540,000 + 2,500,000 + 280,000 + 1,200,000 + 520,000 + 1,300,000 + 120,000 + 140,000 + 1,450,000 =\n\n= 540,000\n+ 2,500,000 → 3,040,000\n+ 280,000 → 3,320,000\n+ 1,200,000 → 4,520,000\n+ 520,000 → 5,040,000\n+ 1,300,000 → 6,340,000\n+ 120,000 → 6,460,000\n+ 140,000 → 6,600,000\n+ 1,450,000 → 8,050,000 total purchases paid\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Determine if other \"Purchase\" entries with Unpaid status\n\nCheck if any other purchase entries labeled \"Unpaid\": Only Purchase20231231005 is seen Unpaid (2,700,000).\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Calculation of ending accounts payable\n\n- Since only 2,700,000 of purchases are Unpaid, that represents the current liability for accounts payable.\n\n- Assuming beginning accounts payable = 0, the increase in accounts payable is 2,700,000.\n\n---\n\n### Final step:\n\n**Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable = Ending balance - Beginning balance = 2,700,000 - 0 = 2,700,000**\n\n---\n\n### Return result:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"2700000.00\"}}\n```\n",
