Operating activities generally include:\n\n- Cash received from customers (sales receipts)\n- Cash paid to suppliers (purchases paid)\n- Cash paid for operating expenses (administrative, sales, financial expenses)\n- Adjustments for non-cash items (such as depreciation)\n- Changes in working capital (like accounts receivable/payable) — since no explicit dialogue about working capital changes, we only consider paid and unpaid statuses affecting cash flow.\n\n**Note:**\n- Sales with payment_status \"Paid\" and payment_method \"Cash\" contribute to cash inflows.\n- Purchases with \"Paid\" payment status and payment_method involving cash or bank transfer are cash outflows.\n- Expenses with \"Paid\" status and paid in cash or bank transfer are cash outflows.\n- Depreciation is a non-cash expense and added back.\n- Interest receivables are ignored as they are not operating cash flows (usually investing or financing), and here all are unpaid or receivable, so no cash effect.\n- Fixed asset purchases, transfers between cash and bank accounts, and initial deposits are investing or financing activities and thus excluded.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Sum of cash inflow from sales (only paid sales):\n\nLook for sales with payment_status = \"Paid\" and payment_method = \"Cash\" (or possibly blank but \"Paid\"), only those are actual cash inflows.\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- Sale20240103004: amount = 12808.37 (Unpaid, ignore)\n- Sale20240104005: amount = 110304.98 (Paid, cash) → 110304.98 inflow\n- Sale20240104006: amount = 261696.18 (Paid, cash) → 261696.18\n- Sale20240105008: amount = 114973.05 (Paid, cash) → 114973.05\n- Sale20240105009: amount = 33923.61 (Paid, cash) → 33923.61\n- Sale20240106010: amount = 110506.16 (Paid, cash) → 110506.16\n- Sale20240106011: amount = 33339.15 (Paid, cash) → 33339.15\n- Sale20240113021: amount = 304821.85 (Paid, cash) → 304821.85\n- Sale20240123043: amount = 269306.76 (Paid, cash) → 269306.76\n- Sale20240123044: amount = 52567.84 (Paid, cash) → 52567.84\n- Sale20240125047: amount = 243734.24 (Paid, cash) → 243734.24\n- Sale20240127049: amount = 173035.77 (Paid, cash) → 173035.77\n- Sale20240127050: amount = 40224.21 (Paid, cash) → 40224.21\n- Sale20240128052: amount = 105539.92 (Paid, cash) → 105539.92\n- Sale20240129053: amount = 578373.95 (Unpaid, ignore)\n- Sale20240129054: amount = 35752.38 (Paid, cash) → 35752.38\n- Sale20240129055: amount = 231897.32 (Paid, cash) → 231897.32\n- Sale20240130056: amount = 128279.1 (Paid, cash) → 128279.10\n- Sale20240130057: amount = 74300.25 (Paid, cash) → 74300.25\n\nWait, some sales with \"Paid\" have payment_method blank or not specified, but according to table they are paid and related to cash.
