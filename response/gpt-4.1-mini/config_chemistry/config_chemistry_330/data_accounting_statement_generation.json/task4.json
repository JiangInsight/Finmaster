Initial entries are for cash, bank deposits, and fixed assets only.\n\nSo,  \n**Accounts Receivable Initial Value = 0.00**\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Calculate change and final Accounts Receivable**\n\nWe must analyze all sales transactions to find those that are unpaid (\"Unpaid\" status) and sum the amounts of their after_tax_amount (or amount) to represent outstanding receivables.\n\n**Look for sales transactions with payment/receipt_status == \"Unpaid\"** and with receive_method or payment_method indicating \"Account Receivable\" or similar.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n\n- Sale entries with \"Unpaid\" status and receive_method or payment status related to Accounts Receivable.\n\nWe sum all such unpaid sales amounts (after tax) plus the unpaid interest receivables.\n\n**Sum unpaid sales amounts (after_tax_amount):**\n\nLooking at relevant \"Sale\" rows with payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\" and customer_id present, extract after_tax_amount:\n\nSome samples of such entries (examples from the problem data):\n\n- 2024-01-03, Unpaid, Sale20240103006, after_tax_amount = 31456.16\n- 2024-01-04, Unpaid, Sale20240104007, after_tax_amount = 274663.86\n- 2024-01-10, Unpaid, Sale20240110016, after_tax_amount = 118453.75\n- 2024-01-12, Unpaid, Sale20240112019, after_tax_amount = 86720.33\n- 2024-01-14, Unpaid, Sale20240114022, after_tax_amount = 23443.13\n- 2024-01-14, Unpaid, Sale20240114023, after_tax_amount = 301969.04\n- 2024-01-18, Unpaid, Sale20240118030, after_tax_amount = 193000.83\n- 2024-01-19, Unpaid, Sale20240119033, after_tax_amount = 561097.27\n- 2024-01-22, Unpaid, Sale20240122036, after_tax_amount = 64583.68\n- 2024-01-24, Unpaid, Sale20240124041, after_tax_amount = 115401.58\n- 2024-01-24, Unpaid, Sale20240124042, after_tax_amount = 48906.08\n- 2024-01-25, Unpaid, Sale20240125044, after_tax_amount = 118704.88\n- 2024-01-25, Unpaid, Sale20240125045, after_tax_amount = 23124.06\n- 2024-01-26, Unpaid, Sale20240126048, after_tax_amount = 10462.56\n- 2024-01-27, Unpaid, Sale20240127032, after_tax_amount = 44872.36\n- 2024-01-27, Unpaid, Sale20240127033, after_tax_amount = 188916.81\n- 2024-01-34 (likely typo 2024-01-18?), Unpaid, Sale20240118035, after_tax_amount = 64718.85\n- 2024-01-19, Unpaid, Sale20240119036, after_tax_amount = 47689.89\n- 2024-01-21, Unpaid, Sale20240121040, after_tax_amount = 393600.36\n- 2024-01-23, Unpaid, Sale20240123044, (actually Paid, skip)\n- 2024-01-24, Unpaid, Sale20240124046, after_tax_amount = 651248.23\n- 2024-01-29, Unpaid, Sale20240129053, after_tax_amount = 549455.25\n\n(Similar for other unpaid sales.)\n\n---\n\nLet's sum the after_tax_amount for all unpaid sales.
