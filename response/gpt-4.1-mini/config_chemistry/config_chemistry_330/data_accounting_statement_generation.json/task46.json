The initial balance at 2023-12-31 is given by the initial cash and bank deposits.\n\nSince \"Initial20231231001\" record lines give initial cash and bank deposits, this sum is our beginning balance.\n\n**Step 4: Double-check that no \"initial\" deposits missing**\n\nNo other initial cash or bank deposits.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe beginning balance in cash and cash equivalents is:\n\n8,000,000.00\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\"}}\n```",
