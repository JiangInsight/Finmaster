Here, the problem does not list any initial inventory amounts explicitly, so initial inventory is zero.\n- Inventory increases come from purchase transactions.\n- Inventory decreases come from sale transactions (using cost_amount).\n\n### Step 1: Initial Inventory\n- No explicit initial inventory entries.\n- So, Inventory Initial Value = 0.00\n\n### Step 2: Inventory Increases - Purchase transactions:\nIdentify all purchase transactions with quantity and cost_per_unit for inventory products:\n\nPurchases:\n\n| product_id | product_name    | quantity | cost_per_unit | amount           |\n|------------|-----------------|----------|---------------|------------------|\n| P002       | Chemical Product B | 27       | 20000.0       | 540000.0         |\n| P004       | Chemical Product D | 25       | 100000.0      | 2500000.0        |\n| P001       | Chemical Product A | 28       | 10000.0       | 280000.0         |\n| P003       | Chemical Product C | 24       | 50000.0       | 1200000.0 (calculated but amount=1,200,000 is not listed, actual is 1,200,000 from qty*cost) |\n| P004       | Chemical Product D | 27       | 100000.0      | 2,700,000.0      |\n| P002       | Chemical Product B | 26       | 20000.0       | 520000.0         |\n| P001       | Chemical Product A | 14       | 10000.0       | 140000.0         |\n| P003       | Chemical Product C | 26       | 50000.0       | 1300000.0        |\n| P001       | Chemical Product A | 12       | 10000.0       | 120000.0         |\n\nNote: Purchase20231231004 (P003, 24 units) amount is 1,200,000.0 (calculated).\n\nSumming amounts for purchases we have:\n\n- 540,000.0 (P002)\n- 2,500,000.0 (P004)\n- 280,000.0 (P001)\n- 1,200,000.0 (P003, Purchase20231231004)\n- 2,700,000.0 (P004)\n- 520,000.0 (P002)\n- 140,000.0 (P001)\n- 1,300,000.0 (P003)\n- 120,000.0 (P001)\n\nSum all these purchase amounts:\n\n540,000 + 2,500,000 + 280,000 + 1,200,000 + 2,700,000 + 520,000 + 140,000 + 1,300,000 + 120,000  \n= 9,300,000.0  \n\n### Step 3: Inventory decreases -
