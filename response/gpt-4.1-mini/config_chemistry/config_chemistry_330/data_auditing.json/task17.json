However, the original problem data showed recorded_amount as 290000 with 29 units and 10000 price, which was inconsistent. In this provided problem, the total, unit_price and quantity are consistent. Also, the preparer changed from Staff to Supervisor between problem and solution, but no inconsistency was flagged for that here.\n\nAll other transactions appear consistent in the given data (based on standard purchase calculation and invoice descriptions). No other fields show inconsistency.\n\nNo inconsistencies or errors are identified in the records provided. Hence the original and recorded values are the same for all fields.",
