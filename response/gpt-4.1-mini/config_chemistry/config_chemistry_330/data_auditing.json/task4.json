Given the problem statement, the correct quantity and amount should be from the invoice info: 27 units * 20000 = 540000.\n- Also, the recorded preparer was \"Supervisor\" (problem shows \"Staff\") â€” so corrected to the problem's value \"Supervisor\".\n- No other inconsistencies found for this record.\n- Other transactions seem consistent or duplicates without errors requiring corrections.",
