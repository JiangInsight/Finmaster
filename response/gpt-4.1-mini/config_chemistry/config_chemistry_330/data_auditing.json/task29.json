The preparer changed is acceptable since the field is not strictly checked here.\n- No error found in internal consistency of quantity, price, amount, payment method, status.\n- Therefore solution reports no inconsistency for the provided data, just returns the important fields for clarity.\n\nNo other fields demonstrate internal inconsistency in this record.",
