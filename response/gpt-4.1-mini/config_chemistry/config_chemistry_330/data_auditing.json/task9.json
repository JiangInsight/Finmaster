Since these are not part of the problem below, no output needed for them.\n\n- The provided problem data only shows one clear inconsistency for transaction id \"Sale20240125047\":\n  - Recorded tax amount: 251742.7\n  - Calculated tax (based on invoice): 12186.71\n  - Correct tax should be \"12186.71\"\n- Hence only one inconsistency report needed:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original tax\": \"12186.71\", \"Recorded tax\": \"251742.7\", \"id\": \"Sale20240125047\"}}\n```\n\n- Since the task requires output of all inconsistencies found with detailed fields, I provide the detailed entry for the found inconsistency:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-25\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-25\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Original payment_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original quantity\": \"2.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"2.0\", \"Original price\": \"121867.12\", \"Recorded price\": \"121867.12\", \"Original receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original amount\": \"243734.24\", \"Recorded amount\": \"243734.24\", \"Original tax\": \"12186.71\", \"Recorded tax\": \"251742.7\", \"Original profit\": \"43734.24\", \"Recorded profit\": \"43734.24\", \"Original Preparer\": \"Supervisor\", \"Recorded Preparer\": \"Supervisor\", \"Original Approver\": \"Director\", \"Recorded Approver\": \"Director\", \"id\": \"Sale20240125047\"}}\n```\n\nNo other inconsistencies detected in provided data.\n\nFinal concise output with only inconsistencies:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-25\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-25\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Original payment_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original quantity\": \"2.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"2.0\", \"Original price\": \"121867.12\", \"Recorded price\": \"121867.12\", \"Original receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original amount\": \"243734.24\", \"Recorded amount\": \"243734.24\", \"Original tax\": \"12186.71\", \"Recorded tax\": \"251742.7\", \"Original profit\": \"43734.24\", \"Recorded profit\": \"43734.24\", \"Original Preparer\": \"Supervisor\", \"Recorded Preparer\": \"Supervisor\", \"Original Approver\": \"Director\", \"Recorded Approver\": \"Director\", \"id\": \"Sale20240125047\"}}\n```",
