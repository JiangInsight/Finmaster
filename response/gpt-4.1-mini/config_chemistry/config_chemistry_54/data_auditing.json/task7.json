In the given input data this was correct.\n\n---\n\nAdditional detected inconsistency:\n\nTransaction ID: Interest20240121021\n\n- Recorded receive_method: \"Cash\"\n\n- Reported receive_method: \"Interest receviable\" (correct typo from \"receviable\" to \"receivable\")\n\nProposed correction:\n- Original receive_method: \"Interest receviable\"\n- Recorded receive_method: \"Cash\"\n- Correct value: \"Interest receivable\" (fix spelling and method)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Interest Receivables\", \"Recorded category\": \"Interest Receivables\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-21\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-21\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Original payment_method\": \"\", \"Recorded payment_method\": \"\", \"Original quantity\": \"\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"\", \"Original price\": \"\", \"Recorded price\": \"\", \"Original receive_method\": \"Interest receviable\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original amount\": \"13.31\", \"Recorded amount\": \"13.31\", \"Original tax\": \"\", \"Recorded tax\": \"\", \"Original profit\": \"\", \"Recorded profit\": \"\", \"Original Preparer\": \"\", \"Recorded Preparer\": \"\", \"Original Approver\": \"\", \"Recorded Approver\": \"\", \"id\": \"Interest20240121021\"}}\n```\n\nSuggested correction for that record would be changing recorded_receive_method from \"Cash\" to \"Interest receivable\".\n\n---\n\nNo other significant internal inconsistencies found based on provided data and invoices.",
