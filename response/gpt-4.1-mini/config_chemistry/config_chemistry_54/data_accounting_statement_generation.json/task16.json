Typically, paid-in capital is represented by the initial funding of the company, often captured at \"Initial\" transactions such as cash deposits, bank deposits, and fixed assets recorded at the start.\n\nFrom the problem data:\n\nInitial transactions with type \"Initial20231231001\":\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.0\n\nSum of initial paid-in capital:\n= 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000\n= 13,000,000\n\nNo other transactions indicate additional paid-in capital or capital reduction.\n\nNo further data shows changes to the paid-in capital account (no new injections or withdrawals of capital).\n\nHence, the initial and ending paid-in capital remain the same.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
