at the initial date (2023-12-31) there is any accounts receivable balance.\n   - From the initial entries, there is no entry labeled as accounts receivable or unpaid sale with \"Account Receviable\" or similar at the initial date.\n   - So, the initial accounts receivable is 0.00.\n\n2. **Final Accounts Receivable:**\n   - Consider all sales transactions recorded after 2023-12-31.\n   - Only sales that are \"Unpaid\" and received by \"Account Receviable\" (note the misspelling but consistently meaning Accounts Receivable) should be counted as accounts receivable, as they represent credit owed by customers.\n   - Also add any \"Interest Receivables\" that are \"Unpaid\" as they are receivable amounts from customers.\n\nFrom the data snippet for sales:\n\nIdentify relevant transactions:\n- Sales with payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\"\n- receive_method = \"Account Receviable\"\n- Sum their amounts.\n\nAdditionally, interest receivables unpaid (interest receivable under asset_name) are part of accounts receivable, so sum all unpaid interest receivables amounts.\n\nStep-by-step:\n\n- Sum all unpaid sales with Account Receviable.\n\nCheck each sale entry with:\n\n- payment/receipt_status: Unpaid\n- receive_method: Account Receviable\n\nSum their amounts.\n\nSimilarly, sum all unpaid interest receivable amounts.\n\nNow compute:\n\n**Unpaid sales with Account Receviable:**\n\nFrom the data, find entries:\n\nExample (not exact, but representative from dataset):\n\n| Sale ID          | payment/receipt_status | receive_method     | amount
