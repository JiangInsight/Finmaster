                        "content": "To calculate the accounts payable:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Initial Accounts Payable**\n- Initial accounts payable is the balance as of the start date (assumed as 2023-12-31).\n- Check if there are any initial accounts payable entries on 2023-12-31.\n- In the provided data, the initial entries on 2023-12-31 are:\n  - Cash deposit\n  - Bank deposit\n  - Fixed Assets\n- None explicitly for accounts payable. So, initial accounts payable = 0.00\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Increase in Accounts Payable due to Purchases on Credit**\n- Purchases marked as \"Unpaid\" with payment_method or payment/receipt_status implying account payable are considered.\n- Find all Purchase entries with \"Unpaid\" status or payment method \"Account Payable\".\n- Relevant Purchase entries with \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Payable\":\n\n| id             | amount     | payment/receipt_status | payment_method    |\n|----------------|------------|-----------------------|-------------------|\n| Purchase20231231003 | 90,000.0    | Unpaid                | Account Payable   |\n| Purchase20231231008 | 2,300,000.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable   |\n| Purchase20231231009 | 130,000.0   | Paid                  | Bank Transfer     | (paid, ignore)\n| Purchase20231231004 | 300,000.0   | Paid                  | Cash              | (paid, ignore)\n| Purchase20231231006 | 850,000.0   | Paid                  | Bank Transfer     | (paid, ignore)\n| Purchase20231231010 | 1,700,000.0 | Paid                  | Bank Transfer     | (paid, ignore)\n| Purchase20231231011 | 300,000.0   | Paid                  | Cash              | (paid, ignore)\n| Purchase20231231012 | 60,000.0    | Paid                  | Bank Transfer     | (paid, ignore)\n\n- Only two purchases with unpaid status and account payable method:\n  - 90,000.0 (Purchase20231231003)\n  - 2,300,000.0 (Purchase20231231008)\n\n**Step 3: Check if any Purchase explicitly marked as Unpaid or Account Payable:**\n\n- Purchase20231231003: 90,000 unpaid via Account Payable\n- Purchase20231231008: 2,300,000 unpaid via Account Payable\n\n**Step 4: Check other Purchases for Unpaid with payment method as Account Payable**\n\n- Also check if any purchase with \"Unpaid\" status but no payment method given.\n- No others found.\n\n**Step 5: Check any Payments that would reduce Account Payable**\n\n- Payments for purchases are marked as \"Paid\", i.e., reduce accounts payable.\n- Here the unpaid purchases remain outstanding, paid purchases already settled.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Initial Accounts Payable: 0.00\n- Ending Accounts Payable = Sum of unpaid purchases with Account Payable = 90,000 + 2,300,000 = 2,390,000.00\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"2390000.00\"}}\n```",
