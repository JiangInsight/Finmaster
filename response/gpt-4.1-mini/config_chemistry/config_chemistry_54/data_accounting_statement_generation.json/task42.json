Identify all taxable sales amounts and their tax amounts (output tax).\n2. Identify all taxable purchase amounts and their tax amounts (input tax).\n3. Calculate total output tax = sum of tax amounts from sales.\n4. Calculate total input tax = sum of tax amounts from purchases.\n5. Tax Payable = Output Tax - Input Tax\n\nFrom the provided data, relevant columns for tax amounts are \"tax_amount\", for sales and purchases.\n\nNote:\n- Purchases have no \"tax_amount\" recorded in the example shown, so presumably purchase tax amounts are not listed or zero.\n- Sales entries have \"tax_amount\" field filled.\n- Expenses and other costs are not part of tax payable calculation.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Sum of all sales tax amounts (Output Tax)**\n\nSum the \"tax_amount\" from all rows with type = \"Sale\" (and having a tax_amount).\n\nLooking at the entries, only sales rows have meaningful tax_amount values, all others have empty or no tax.\n\nCalculate total tax from all sale entries:\n\n- 2024-01-02, Sale: tax_amount = 2803.89\n- 2024-01-02, Sale: 9657.13\n- 2024-01-03, Sale: 5248.49\n- 2024-01-03, Sale: 6919.94\n- 2024-01-04, Sale: 2439.81\n- 2024-01-05, Sale: 13114.04\n- 2024-01-05, Sale: 1103.71\n- 2024-01-06, Sale: 3400.41\n- 2024-01-06, Sale: 8547.22\n- 2024-01-07, Sale: 10336.18\n- 2024-01-07, Sale: 2583.56\n- 2024-01-08, Sale: 14703.48\n- 2024-01-08, Sale: 1301.28\n- 2024-01-09, Sale: 1339.9\n- 2024-01-09, Sale: 3000.2\n- 2024-01-10, Sale: 8499.39\n- 2024-01-11, Sale: 11204.12\n- 2024-01-12, Sale: 1155.46\n- 2024-01-14, Sale: 6333.26\n- 2024-01-14, Sale: 5474.26\n- 2024-01-15, Sale: 2244.23\n- 2024-01-15, Sale: 33526.02\n- 2024-01-16, Sale: 4061.9\n- 2024-01-16, Sale: 8547.22 (already counted?
