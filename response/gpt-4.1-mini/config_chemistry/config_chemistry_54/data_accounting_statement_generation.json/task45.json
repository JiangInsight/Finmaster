Typically, these include purchases and sales of fixed assets or investments.\n\nStep 1: Identify investing activities in the data.\n- Look for transactions related to fixed assets purchases.\n- These transactions are indicated by type: \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar.\n- We will sum the amounts of paid fixed asset purchases (cash outflow).\n\nStep 2: Check if there are any sales of fixed assets or similar (cash inflows) â€” none are mentioned explicitly for sales of fixed assets in given data.\n\nStep 3: Calculate net cash flow from investing activities = Sum of cash inflows (e.g., sales of fixed assets) - Sum of cash outflows (fixed assets purchases).\n\n---\n\nFrom the data:\n\n\"FixedAsset20231231001\" entries represent Fixed Assets Purchase with amounts and payment_status = Paid.\n\nList of fixed asset purchases (Paid):\n\n1) 230120.87  \n2) 478737.63  \n3) 351585.3  \n4) 386528.93  \n\nSum = 230120.87 + 478737.63 + 351585.3 + 386528.93  \n= (230120.87 + 478737.63) + (351585.3 + 386528.93)  \n= 708858.5 + 738114.23  \n= 1,446,972.73\n\nNo cash inflows from fixed assets sales in the data.\n\n---\n\nTherefore,\n\nNet cash flow from investing activities = -1,446,972.73\n\n(Negative sign because these are cash outflows.)\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-1446972.73\"}}\n```",
