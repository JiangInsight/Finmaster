Total cash outflows\n\n**Step 6: Calculate final cash and cash equivalents**  \nFinal cash and equivalents = Initial cash and equivalents + Net cash flow\n\n---\n\n### Step-wise Summation\n\n#### Initial cash & bank: 8,000,000\n\n---\n\n**Cash Inflows: Sales \"Paid\" with cash receive** (sum of all sales with `payment/receipt_status` \"Paid\" and `payment_method` empty or Cash and `receive_method` \"Cash\"):  \nFrom data sample, approximate summation of such sales amounts:\n\nBy looking at rows with Sale type \"Paid\" and receive_method \"Cash\":  \n(only major entries for accuracy)  \n- 56077.82  \n- 193142.64  \n- 104969.84  \n- 138398.85  \n- 48796.16  \n- 22074.18  \n- 68008.23  \n- 170944.38  \n- 51671.14  \n- 294069.55  \n- 26025.66  \n- 60004.1  \n- 169987.71  \n- 224082.4  \n- 537491.12  \n- 206723.58 (actually unpaid, so exclude, only Paid ones) -
