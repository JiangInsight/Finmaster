Identify all transactions where the \"type\" is an expense category relevant to the income statement expenses. These typically include:\n   - Administrative Expenses\n   - Sales Expenses\n   - Financial Expenses\n   - Depreciation (usually included in expenses)\n\n2. Sum the \"amount\" of all such expense transactions.\n\n3. Ignore other types like Purchases, Sales, Interest Receivables (income), Fixed Assets (capital expenditure), Cash or Bank deposits, and Transfers.\n\n---\n\n**Extract expense entries and sum their
