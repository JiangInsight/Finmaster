Record the amount of Interest Receivables at the beginning of the period and at the end of the period.\n3. Calculate the difference:\n   - If the Interest Receivable increases, it is shown as a negative cash flow (an increase in receivables reduces cash).\n   - If the Interest Receivable decreases, it is shown as a positive cash flow.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Identify Interest Receivables entries at the start and end**\n\n- Initial date for comparison is 2023-12-31 with no explicit Interest Receivables given, so the start is based on earlier entries if any or zero if none.\n\n- From given data, however, the earliest Interest Receivables amount we have is on 2024-01-01: 347.10 (approx).\n\n- The latest Interest Receivables is on 2024-01-31: 9.16942703 (approx).\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Sum Interest Receivables balances at two dates**\n\nWe will consider the Interest Receivable balance on:\n\n- **Start date (2024-01-01)**: Interest Receivables = 347.10\n\n- **End date (2024-01-31)**: Interest Receivables = 9.1694\n\nNote: In the dataset, Interest Receivables are mostly recorded daily as amounts with payment/receipt status unpaid, representing accrued but not yet collected interest for that day.\n\nSo to find the ending balance, we analyze the last entry on the last date 2024-01-31 with Interest Receivables showing 9.1694.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Calculate net change (ending balance - starting balance)**\n\nIncrease (decrease) in Interest Receivable = Ending Interest Receivable - Starting Interest Receivable\n\n= 9.1694 - 347.10 = -337.9306 (approximately)\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Interpret result**\n\nThe negative value means the Interest Receivable balance has decreased by about 337.93.\n\nA decrease in Interest Receivable represents a cash inflow (collection of receivables).\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Final Output**\n\nThe change in Interest Receivable to report in the cash flow statement is:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"337.93\"}}\n\n(Positive number because it's a decrease in receivables, hence cash inflow.)\n\n---\n\n# Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"337.93\"}}\n```",
