Usually, in initial data, accounts receivable starting balance should be given if relevant, but in this dataset it is absent.\n  \n- Since the initial data only provides cash, bank deposit, fixed assets, and purchase payable info but no accounts receivable, we assume **the opening accounts receivable balance = 0.0** at 2023-12-31.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Closing Accounts Receivable (at 2024-01-31 or last date available)\n\nAccounts receivable arises from **sales made on \"Account Receivable\" or \"Account Receviable\" payment/receipt_status** which remain unpaid.\n\nSo we:\n\n- Identify all **Sales** transactions with **payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\"** and **receive_method (or payment/receipt_status)** showing \"Account Receviable\"/\"Account Receivable\"\n- Sum their **amounts**\n- Also consider that there might be negative or adjustment entries but mostly positive unpaid sales define accounts receivable.\n\nFrom the data, identify sales with \"Unpaid\" and payment method or receive_method indicating accounts receivable:\n\nLook for sales records with payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\" and receive_method or payment method = Account Receviable or customer_id present (the field \"receive_method\" is sometimes \"Account Receviable\"):\n\nExamples of such entries and their amounts:\n\nFrom the dataset, extract all sales entries with payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\" and receive_method indicating accounts receivable and amount value:\n\nSummarize these unpaid accounts receivable amounts.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Find total Accounts Receivable balance at end\n\nWe sum amounts of all sales with:\n\n- `payment/receipt_status` = `\"Unpaid\"` (meaning amount not collected yet)\n- `receive_method` or `payment_method` is `\"Account Receviable\"` or similar spelling\n\nFrom the data (filtering sales with Unpaid and Account Receviable type):\n\n- Sale20240107015: 206723.58 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240109020: 26797.98 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240115032: 670520.35 is Paid, so exclude.\n- Sale20240118039: 329591.1 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240119041: 44592.68 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240121044: 11720.95 Paid - exclude\n- Sale20240122045: 589723.85 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240123047: 99829.6 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240123048: 300602.55 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240124050: 599806.8 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240125052: 47724.26 Paid, exclude\n- Sale20240127055: 193211.7 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240128057: 110325.5 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240129058: 134841.9 Paid, exclude\n\n- Additional sales with unpaid and Account Receviable may be found, for example:\n\n- Sale20240109020: 26797.98 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240111024: 224082.4 (Paid, exclude)\n- Sale20240112025: 23109.22 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240117035: 111969.96 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240124042: 51480.08 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240125044: 124952.5 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240125045: 24341.12 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\nAdding all such unpaid amounts:\n\nLet's list all unpaid account receivable amounts explicitly:\n\n- 206,723.58\n- 26,797.98\n- 32,109.22 (Sale20240112025)\n- 111,969.96 (Sale20240117035)\n- 32,740.08 (Sale20240124042) - The sale20240124042 amount is \"51480.08\" (check exact value)\n- 51,480.08\n- 124,952.5 (Sale20240125044)\n- 24,341.12 (Sale20240125045)\n- 193,211.7 (Sale20240127055)\n- 110,325.5 (Sale20240128057)\n- 329,591.1 (Sale20240118039)\n- 44,592.68 (Sale20240119041)\n- 589,723.85 (Sale20240122045)\n- 99,829.6 (Sale20240123047)\n- 300,602.55 (Sale20240123048)\n- 599,806.8 (Sale20240124050)\n\nNow adding these unpaid sales amounts (accounts receivable):\n\nSum = 206,723.58 + 26,797.98 + 23,109.22 + 111,969.96 + 51,480.08 + 124,952.5 + 24,341.12 + 193,211.7 + 110,325.5 + 329,591.1 + 44,592.68 + 589,723.85 + 99,829.6 + 300,602.55 + 599,806.8\n\nNote: The 23,109.22 is sale20240112025 number?
