We need to further consider if transfers multiply counted.\n\nBut looking at initial data, the initial bank deposit is 5,000,000.  \nThere are large purchases and asset purchases paid via bank transfer (~6.3 million out).\n\nThere are inflows (transfers from cash to bank) of 4.6 million.\n\nSince bank deposits can increase by transferring cash to bank and decrease by purchases.\n\nTo be sure, check for any purchases paid by cash or unpaid that would not influence bank:\n\n- Purchases paid by cash do not influence bank deposits directly.\n\n- Expenses are mostly paid by cash, so no effect on bank deposits.\n\nSo above calculation stands.\n\n---\n\n**Final:**\n\nInitial bank deposits = 5,000,000.00  \nFinal bank deposits = 3,263,027.27 (rounded to two decimals)\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"3263027.27\"}}\n```",
