The relevant line item for this is usually \"Accounts Payable.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Locate the \"Accounts Payable\" line item, as it represents amounts owed to creditors for goods or services on credit.\n2. Extract the Initial_amount and End_amount values for \"Accounts Payable\":\n   - Initial_amount = 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n   - End_amount = 2390000.00 (as of 2024-01-31)\n\nHence, the initial value owed was 0.00, and at the end date, it increased to 2,390,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"2390000.00\"}}\n```",
