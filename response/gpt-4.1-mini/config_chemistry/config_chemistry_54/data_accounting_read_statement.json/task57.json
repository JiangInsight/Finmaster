This indicates the addition in amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is 2,390,000.00.\n\n5. The cash flow statement also confirms this under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with the same amount 2,390,000.00.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2390000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"2390000.00\"}}\n```",
