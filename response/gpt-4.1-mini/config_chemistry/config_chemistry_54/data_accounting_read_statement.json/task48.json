The first relevant line item is \"Net Profit,\" which represents the profit after all expenses (operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, amortization).\n2. The second relevant line item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which corresponds to the cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment (long-term assets).\n\nLooking at the problem data:\n\n- Net Profit: -1669849.77\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 1446972.73\n\nThus the extracted answers are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '-1669849.77', 'value2': '1446972.73'}}\n```",
