The amount of interest accrued but not yet received — found as \"Interest Receivable\" on the Balance Sheet (end value) or equivalent.\n2. The net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period — found from the Cash Flow Statement under \"Net Increase\" of cash and cash equivalents.\n\n**Step 1: Find Interest Receivable (amount of interest accrued but not yet received)**\n\n- From the Balance Sheet:\n  | Account             | End_amount | End_date   |\n  |---------------------|------------|------------|\n  | Interest Receivable  | 2566.71    | 2024-01-31 |\n\nThe accrued but not yet received interest is 2566.71.\n\n**Step 2: Find net addition to cash and cash equivalents**\n\n- From Cash Flow Statement:\n  | Account       | Amount      | Date       |\n  |---------------|-------------|------------|\n  | Net Increase  | -7161080.18 | 2024-01-31 |\n\nSo the net increase in cash and cash equivalents is -7161080.18 (a decrease).\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"2566.71\", \"value2\": \"-7161080.18\"}}\n```",
