Amount of taxes accrued but not yet paid (from the Balance Sheet)\n2. Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities (from the Income Statement)\n3. The net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's principal revenue-producing activities (from the Cash Flow Statement)\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: From the **Balance Sheet**  \n- The line item representing taxes accrued but not yet paid is typically \"Taxes Payable\".  \n- From balance sheet, find the \"Taxes Payable\" line under ending amounts:  \n  - Taxes Payable: 346025.72\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: From the **Income Statement**  \n- The total income arising in the course of ordinary activities usually corresponds to the main revenue line or total revenue.  \n- Here, the line is \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue\" (both have the same value).  \n- Value: 6920513.79  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3: From the **Cash Flow Statement**  \n- The net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities (principal revenue-producing activities).  \n- The relevant line is \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\"  \n- Value: -5714107.45\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"346025.72\", \"value2\": \"6920513.79\", \"value3\": \"-5714107.45\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\nThis matches the prompt order:\n\n1. From Balance Sheet - taxes accrued but not yet paid: 346025.72  \n2. From Income Statement - total income / revenue: 6920513.79  \n3. From Cash Flow Statement - net cash from operating activities: -5714107.45",
