The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life (i.e., **Depreciation**).\n2. Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period (often represented as changes in **Inventory**).\n3. Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends (from the investing activities, here shown as **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**).\n4. Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period (usually shown as **Net Increase** in cash and cash equivalents).\n\nStep-by-step:\n\n- **value1**: Depreciation = 45742.50\n- **value2**: Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale or in production = (Increase) Decrease in Inventory = -3900000.00\n- **value3**: Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -1446972.73\n- **value4**: Net Increase in cash and cash equivalents = -7161080.18\n\nFinal result:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"45742.50\", \"value2\": \"-3900000.00\", \"value3\": \"-1446972.73\", \"value4\": \"-7161080.18\"}}\n```",
