                        "content": "Let's analyze the problem step by step following the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### What to extract:\n\n1. **Three specific line items and end value of profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**  \n   - This corresponds to **Profit Before Tax** from the income statement.\n\n2. **The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**  \n   - This corresponds to the change/increase in **Accounts Payable** from the balance sheet.\n\n3. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**  \n   - This corresponds to **Paid-in Capital** from the balance sheet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Extract from the Balance Sheet\n\n- **Paid-in Capital** (capital contributed by shareholders)  \n  Look for **Paid-in Capital**:  \n  End_amount = 13000000.00\n\n- **Accounts Payable** (amount owed for goods/services on credit)  \n  End_amount = 2390000.00\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Extract Profit Before Tax from the Income Statement\n\n- **Profit Before Tax** = -1323824.05\n\n---\n\n### Final grouping output as per instruction:\n\n- Balance Sheet (two values, in original order):\n  1. Paid-in Capital: 13000000.00  \n  2. Accounts Payable: 2390000.00\n\n- Income Statement:\n  3. Profit Before Tax: -1323824.05\n\n---\n\n### Presenting the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"13000000.00\", \"value2\": \"-1323824.05\", \"value3\": \"2390000.00\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\n\n- The order of grouping by financial statement is:  \n  Balance Sheet (Paid-in Capital, Accounts Payable)  \n  Income Statement (Profit Before Tax)\n\nHowever, the instructions say within each group, maintain original order as shown in input statement.\n\nIn the balance sheet input, **Accounts Payable** appears before **Paid-in Capital**, so we should keep their order as in the input:\n\nFrom input balance sheet snippet:\n\n| Account          | End_amount   |  \n|------------------|--------------|  \n| ...              |              |  \n| Accounts Payable  | 2390000.00   |  \n| Taxes Payable    | ...           |  \n| Total Current Liabilities | ...     |  \n| Paid-in Capital  | 13000000.00  |  \n\nTherefore, the order in Balance Sheet group is:\n\n- Accounts Payable: 2390000.00  \n- Paid-in Capital: 13000000.00  \n\nBut the problem statement lists that the **capital contributed by shareholders** is from **Paid-in Capital** (capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares), and the **addition in the amount owed** is **Accounts Payable**.\n\nThe example solution groups it as value1 (Paid-in Capital), value2 (Profit Before Tax), value3 (Accounts Payable).\n\nBut careful reading shows it requests output grouped by statement in order:  \n1. Balance Sheet  \n2. Income Statement  \n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nWithin each group, original order of line items as in input statement.\n\nSince we only need three outputs in total:\n\n- From the balance sheet, two items: **Accounts Payable**, **Paid-in Capital**  \n- From income statement: **Profit Before Tax**\n\nOriginal order for balance sheet from input table is:  \n- Accounts Payable  \n- Taxes Payable  \n- Total Current Liabilities  \n- Paid-in Capital  \n\nSo keep order: Accounts Payable, then Paid-in Capital  \nThen profit before tax from income statement.\n\nTherefore final solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"2390000.00\", \"value2\": \"13000000.00\", \"value3\": \"-1323824.05\"} }\n```\n\nBecause in the problem description example, value1 is from balance sheet (capital contributed by shareholders) â€” it shows first value1 as Paid-in Capital, then value2 as Profit before tax, then value3 as Accounts Payable.\n\nBut the problem states for multiple outputs, group by financial statement in order: 1. Balance Sheet 2. Income Statement 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nAnd within each group keep original line order.\n\nAnd asked to extract:\n\n- profit or loss before tax (income statement)\n\n- addition in amount owed for goods/services received on credit (balance sheet)\n\n- capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares (balance sheet)\n\nSummary:\n\nThe three specific line items are:\n\n- Profit Before Tax (income statement)\n\n- Addition in Accounts Payable (balance sheet)\n\n- Paid-in Capital (balance sheet)\n\nSo the three values are:\n\n- From Balance Sheet:\n\n  - Accounts Payable (increase/addition): 2390000.00\n\n  - Paid-in Capital: 13000000.00\n\n- From Income Statement:\n\n  - Profit Before Tax: -1323824.05\n\nNow, the problem wants the output order grouped by financial statement:\n\n1. Balance sheet: both items, in the original order as in input:\n\n   - Accounts Payable first\n\n   - Paid-in Capital second\n\n2. Income statement: Profit Before Tax\n\nTherefore:\n\nvalue1 = Accounts Payable = 2390000.00\n\nvalue2 = Paid-in Capital = 13000000.00\n\nvalue3 = Profit Before Tax = -1323824.05\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"2390000.00\", \"value2\": \"13000000.00\", \"value3\": \"-1323824.05\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n**Note about the example in prompt**: The example solution only outputs 3 values and assignments are:\n\n{\"value1\": '13000000.00', 'value2': '-1373590.51', 'value3': '1590000.00'}\n\nWhere:\n\n- Value1: Paid-in Capital\n\n- Value2: Profit Before Tax\n\n- Value3: Accounts Payable\n\nThis indicates the order for this task is:\n\nvalue1 - Paid-in Capital (balance sheet)\n\nvalue2 - profit before tax (income statement)\n\nvalue3 - amounts owed addition (Accounts Payable) (balance sheet)\n\nBut instructions specify to group by financial statement order and keep original line item order within group.\n\nSo, as the example shows, value1 (Paid-in Capital), value2 (Profit Before Tax), value3 (Accounts Payable).\n\nThen we should keep the same order for consistency with the example.\n\nTherefore final output per example method:\n\nvalue1: Paid-in Capital: 13000000.00\n\nvalue2: Profit Before Tax: -1323824.05\n\nvalue3: Accounts Payable: 2390000.00\n\n---\n\n### Final output consistent with example:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"13000000.00\", \"value2\": \"-1323824.05\", \"value3\": \"2390000.00\"} }\n```\n\n# This matches the example format and reasoning.",
