The line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is the correct one. The value is -1454443.80, which indicates the net change (increase here).\n\nEven though the value is negative (an increase rather than a decrease), this is the exact reported value for the change in credit amounts. The task is to identify and extract this line item and its value.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-1454443.80\"}}\n```\n",
