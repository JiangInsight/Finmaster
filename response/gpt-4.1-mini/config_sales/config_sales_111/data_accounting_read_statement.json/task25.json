                        "content": "To identify and extract the costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services, we focus on the related expense line items commonly including:\n\n- Costs to deliver goods and services: usually captured by \"Cost of Goods Sold\"\n- Costs to secure customer orders: usually found under \"Selling Expenses\" (marketing, sales, commissions)\n\nFrom the provided income statement:\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 3,140,000.00 (cost to deliver goods/services)\n- Selling Expenses = 793,728.19 (costs to secure orders/customers)\n\nSince the task asks to extract the cost specifically incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods/services, both \"Cost of Goods Sold\" and \"Selling Expenses\" are relevant.\n\nBut from the example given in the prompt, only \"Selling Expenses\" was extracted as the direct cost to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services.\n\nThe \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is typically cost to produce the goods, while \"Selling Expenses\" are more directly related to securing orders and delivering to customers, such as sales staff, marketing, distribution.\n\nThus, based on the example and typical accounting classification:\n\n- The cost to secure orders and deliver goods is represented by \"Selling Expenses\": 793,728.19\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"793728.19\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"793728.19\"}}\n```",
