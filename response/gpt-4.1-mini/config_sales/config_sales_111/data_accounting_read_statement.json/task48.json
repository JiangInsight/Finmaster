The amount of profit an entity retains after all expenses (including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) have been deducted from total revenue. This corresponds to the \"Net Profit\" value.\n2. The cash payments to acquire property, plant, equipment, and other long-term assets, corresponding to \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nFrom the problem's cash flow statement:\n\n- Net Profit: 1105265.77\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 437464.43\n\nThese values correspond to the two required line items, and we keep the original order as in the statement.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1105265.77', 'value2': '437464.43'} }\n```",
