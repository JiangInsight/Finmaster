Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit.  \n   - This corresponds to **Accounts Receivable** on the Balance Sheet.\n\n2. Financing costs incurred by the enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation.  \n   - This corresponds to **Financial Expenses** (or similar interest/financing costs) on the Income Statement.\n\n3. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.  \n   - This corresponds to the line item related to purchase or acquisition of fixed assets in the Cash Flow Statement (often under Investing Activities). Here, it is labeled **Purchase of Fixed Assets**.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Balance Sheet: Amounts owed to entity on credit**  \n   - Look for \"Accounts Receivable\" in Balance Sheet.  \n   - Value: `1454443.80` (End_amount for \"Accounts Receivable\")\n\n2. **Income Statement: Financing costs incurred**  \n   - Look for financing related expenses: \"Financial Expenses\" line.  \n   - Value: `112130.48`\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement: Cash payments to acquire PPE and other long-term assets**  \n   - Look for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in Cash Flow Statement under investing activities.  \n   - Value: `437464.43`\n\n---\n\n### Final extraction:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"1454443.80\", \"value2\": \"112130.48\", \"value3\": \"437464.43\"}}\n```",
