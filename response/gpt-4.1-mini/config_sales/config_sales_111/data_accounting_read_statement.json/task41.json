The task is to identify and extract the specific line item and value related to the increase in the amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid.\n\n2. On the cash flow statement, the relevant line item is usually labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable.\"\n\n3. From the provided table, the line \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" has an amount of 288001.20 for the date 2024-01-28.\n\n4. This amount reflects the increase in tax accrued but unpaid, matching the task requirement.\n\nThus, the extracted value for the increase in tax payable is 288001.20.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"288001.20\"} }\n```",
