The task is to identify and extract the specific line items and the value of the difference between revenue and cost.\n\nStep 1: Identify the revenue amount.\n- \"Total Revenue\" = 5760023.09\n\nStep 2: Identify the cost amount.\n- \"Total Cost\" = 3140000.00\n\nStep 3: Calculate the difference between revenue and cost.\n- Difference = Total Revenue - Total Cost = 5760023.09 - 3140000.00 = 2620023.09\n\nStep 4: Verify that this difference appears in the statement.\n- \"Gross Profit\" = 2620023.09, which matches the calculated difference.\n\nTherefore, the value to extract is \"2620023.09\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"2620023.09\"}}\n```",
