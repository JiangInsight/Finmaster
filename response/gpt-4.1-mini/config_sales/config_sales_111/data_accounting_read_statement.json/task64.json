Balance Sheet  \n2. Income Statement  \n3. Cash Flow Statement  \nWithin each, maintain the original line item order.\"\n\nFor addition in Accounts Payable, choose the amount from Balance Sheet (end amount) since problem example uses that value for Accounts Payable (the addition). The increase is simply the end amount here because initial was zero.\n\nStep 4: Format the final solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"13000000.00\", \"value2\": \"1393266.97\", \"value3\": \"1260000.00\"}}\n```",
