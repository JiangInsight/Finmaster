The task requires identifying and extracting the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities that are:\n   - Acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents\n   - Receipt of interest and dividends\n\n2. These activities are reflected in the **Cash Flow from Investing Activities** section.\n\n3. From the input:\n   - The **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities** is \"-437464.43\"\n   - The only line item under Cash Flow from Investing Activities is **Purchase of Fixed Assets** with an amount of \"437464.43\"\n\n4. Since there is no receipt of interest and dividends line item in the input, the net cash flow from investing activities is entirely represented by \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n\n5. The net value is -437464.43 (cash outflow).\n\n6. Decomposition of the item into 1 sub-item, which is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of 437464.43 (cash paid, positive amount).\n\n**Therefore:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-437464.43\", \"sub_items_Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"437464.43\"}}\n```",
