For these:\n\n- The original amount should be positive.\n\n- Since invoice is declared amount, we expect the recorded amount should be corrected to positive values.\n\nTherefore identify these:\n\n1. Interest20240110010:\n\n   - Recorded amount: -54.77\n\n   - Estimated correct amount: 54.77\n\n2. Interest20240111011:\n\n   - Recorded amount: -19.17\n\n   - Estimated correct amount: 19.17\n\n3.

Interest20240120020: Recorded amount 440.9, invoice amount 384.33 - Recorded amount should be corrected to 384.33 (invoice value more reliable).\n\n2-5. Interest receivable entries with negative amounts: recorded value negative, should be corrected to positive values with absolute amounts from recorded (assuming supposed to be positive):\n\n- Interest20240110010, change recorded amount from -54.77 to 54.77\n\n- Interest20240111011 from -19.17 to 19.17\n\n- Interest20240128028 from -56.55 to 56.55\n\n- Interest20240127027 from -92.15 to 92.15\n\nThis is the set of detected errors.\n\nNo other inconsistencies detected in other transactions.\n\nFinal answer with example for one:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"384.33\", \"Recorded amount\": \"440.9\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Interest20240120020\"}} \n```\n\nAnd separate similar entries as detected.\n\n# Summary of corrections of internal inconsistencies:\n\n- Interest20240120020: Recorded amount corrected from 440.9 to 384.33\n\n- Interest20240110010: Recorded amount corrected from -54.77 to 54.77\n\n- Interest20240111011: Recorded amount corrected from -19.17 to 19.17\n\n- Interest20240128028: Recorded amount corrected from -56.55 to 56.55\n\n- Interest20240127027: Recorded amount corrected from -92.15 to 92.15\n",
