Based on invoice, payment status should be \"Unpaid\".  \n  - Payment method recorded as \"Bank Transfer\", but invoice describes \"account payable\" (which is consistent with unpaid). So correct payment_method should be \"Account Payable\".  \n- Quantity, unit price, amount align consistently, no correction needed there.  \n- Approver and preparer are consistent with invoice narrative.  \n- Hence the main inconsistency is in payment/receipt_status and payment_method fields.  \n- Original (correct) values inferred from invoice and categorical context.",
