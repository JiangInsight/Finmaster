The payment_method of this transaction was bank transfer, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- Thus recorded_payment/receipt_status and recorded_payment_method are inconsistent with the invoice.\n- Best estimate: payment/receipt_status = \"Paid\", payment_method = \"Bank Transfer\".\n- Other Purchase entries with similar patterns show that \"Account Payable\" usually means unpaid.\n- The payment/receipt_status and payment_method fields here contradict the invoice details and the recorded_amount calculation. All other fields seem accurate.\n- Therefore, only these two fields are flagged as inconsistent and corrected.",
