Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n= Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities  \n= 803,237.11 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 0.519  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio  \nDebt = Total Liabilities = Total Assets - Owner's Equity = 15,653,266.97 - 14,105,265.77 = 1,548,001.20 (which equals current liabilities, no long term liabilities were given, so total liabilities = current liabilities)  \nEquity = 14,105,265.77  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Debt / Equity = 1,548,001.20 / 14,105,265.77 ≈ 0.11  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n= Total Revenue / Average Total Assets  \n  \nWe only have ending total assets and initial total assets:  \nInitial Total Assets = 13,000,000.00 (from 2023-12-31)  \nEnding Total Assets = 15,653,266.97  \n  \nAverage Total Assets = (13,000,000 + 15,653,266.97) / 2 = 14,326,633.485  \n  \nTotal Asset Turnover = 5,760,023.09 / 14,326,633.485 ≈ 0.402  \n\n---\n\n### 4.

Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \nThis is the same as Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio here:  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = 803,237.11 / 1,548,001.20 = 0.519 (rounded 0.52)  \n\n---\n\n### 6.

Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover = Total Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n\nInitial Accounts Receivable = 0 (as per 2023-12-31)  \nEnding Accounts Receivable = 1,454,443.80  \n  \nAverage Accounts Receivable = (0 + 1,454,443.80) / 2 = 727,221.90  \n  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover = 5,760,023.09 / 727,221.90 ≈ 7.92  \n\n---\n\n### Final results:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"0.52\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.40\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"6.35\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"0.52\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"8.15%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"7.92\"\n  }\n}\n```",
