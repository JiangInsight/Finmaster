Here we only have current liabilities:  \nTotal Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20  \nNo long-term liabilities are given, so Total Debt = 1,548,001.20\n\nStep 3: Calculate the ratio  \nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = 803,237.11 / 1,548,001.20 â‰ˆ 0.5189\n\nRounded to two decimal places = 0.52\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"0.52\"}}\n```",
