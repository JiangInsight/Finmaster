Here, only current liabilities are explicitly given. No long-term liabilities given, so we assume Debt = Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n\nFormula:  \nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt\n\n= 803,237.11 / 1,548,001.20  \n≈ 0.5188  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\nFormula:  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = COGS / Average Inventory\n\n- Beginning Inventory = 0 (from balance sheet at initial date)  \n- Ending Inventory = 430,000.00\n\nAverage Inventory = (0 + 430,000) / 2 = 215,000\n\nInventory Turnover = 3,140,000 / 215,000  \n≈ 14.60  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nAssuming Debt = Total Liabilities = Current Liabilities as no others given: 1,548,001.20  \n\nOwner's Equity = 14,105,265.77  \n\nDebt to Equity = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity  \n= 1,548,001.20 / 14,105,265.77  \n≈ 0.1097  \n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Quick Ratio\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable  \n= 4,863,237.11 + 3,502,535.57 + 11,346.19 + 1,454,443.80  \n= 9,831,562.67  \n\nCurrent Liabilities = 1,548,001.20  \n\nQuick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities  \n= 9,831,562.67 / 1,548,001.20  \n≈ 6.35  \n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Current Ratio\n\nCurrent Assets = 10,261,562.67  \nCurrent Liabilities = 1,548,001.20  \n\nCurrent Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \n= 10,261,562.67 / 1,548,001.20  \n≈ 6.63  \n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio ≈ 0.52  \n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio ≈ 0.52  \n- Inventory Turnover Ratio ≈ 14.60  \n- Debt to Equity Ratio ≈ 0.11  \n- Quick Ratio ≈ 6.35  \n- Current Ratio ≈ 6.63  \n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"0.52\", \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"0.52\", \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"14.60\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"6.35\", \"Current Ratio\": \"6.63\"}}\n```",
