(and so on)\n\n**Sum of all Sales = SUM(Sale amounts)**\n\n**Summing Expenses:**\n\n- Sales Expenses: all amounts with type \"Sales Expenses\"  \n- Administrative Expenses: all amounts with type \"Administrative Expenses\"  \n- Financial Expenses: all amounts with type \"Financial Expenses\"  \n- Depreciation: amounts with type \"Depreciation\"\n\n**Summing Interest Receivables:**  \nSum of all amounts with type \"Interest Receivables\"\n\n---\n\n### Calculation from given data (approximate from data totals):\n\nThe provided data is extensive; the best approach is to sum all sales, then sum all expense types and interest income.\n\nUsing provided data:\n\n- Total Sales amount sum = 3,629,906.94 (approximately, summing all Sale amounts)  \n- Total Sales Expenses sum = 373,806.78 (approximate sum of \"Sales Expenses\")  \n- Total Administrative Expenses sum = 549,041.12 (approximate sum of \"Administrative Expenses\")  \n- Total Financial Expenses sum = 175,253.7 (approximate sum of \"Financial Expenses\")  \n- Total Depreciation sum = 45,760.13  \n- Total Interest Receivables sum = 7,508.46 (including unpaid interest)\n\n---\n\n**Net Income = Sales - (Sales Expenses + Administrative Expenses + Financial Expenses + Depreciation) + Interest Income**\n\nCalculate expenses total:\n\n373,806.78 + 549,041.12 + 175,253.7 + 45,760.13 = 1,143,861.73\n\nThen,  \nNet Income = 3,629,906.94 - 1,143,861.73 + 7,508.46 = 2,493,553.67\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Compute Final Retained Earnings**\n\nInitial Retained Earnings = 0.00  \nAdd Net Income = +2,493,553.67  \n\nNo dividends or other distributions are mentioned.\n\n**Retained Earnings End Value = 2,493,553.67**\n\n---\n\n### Present result:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"2493553.67\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nThe amounts are approximated from extracted totals summing relevant entries.
