These do not affect accounts payable balance (they were paid at purchase), so they are excluded from AP.\n\nAlso, there's a purchase with \"Unpaid\" but no explicit payment reducing AP. So the ending accounts payable is the total of unpaid purchases.\n\n**Step 5: Confirm the initial accounts payable**  \nNo initial AP amount from the initial entries → 0.00\n\n**Step 6: Final accounts payable value is sum of unpaid purchases: 1,260,000**\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"1260000.00\"}}\n```",
