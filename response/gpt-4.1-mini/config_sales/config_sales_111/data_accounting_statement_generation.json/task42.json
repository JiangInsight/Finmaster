In the problem data, tax_amount is empty for purchases meaning no explicit tax amount is provided.\n- If no tax amount is given for purchases, we can estimate input tax on purchases by calculating tax based on their unit price (assuming tax rate consistent).\n- To be consistent with example, the tax amount for purchases is zero (no data given).\n  \nSince only sales transactions contain `tax_amount`, and all purchases have empty tax_amount (no tax) based on the provided data, we take:\n\n**Total Output Tax (from sales) = Sum of tax_amount for sales**\n\n**Total Input Tax (from purchases) = 0**\n\nHence,\n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Tax Payable = Total Output Tax - Total Input Tax  \n= Sum of sales tax_amount - 0  \n= Sum of tax_amount in sales\n  \n---\n\n**Step 3: Sum tax_amount for all sales rows**\n\nFilter rows with type = \"Sale\" that have tax_amount values and sum their tax_amount.\n\nFrom the problem's sales transactions snippets:\n\nLet's sum approximate tax_amount (all sales lines tax_amount value):\n\n- 5235.38  \n- 1278.94  \n- 1293.13  \n- 5817.5  \n- 4603.34  \n- 1928.23  \n- 459.22  \n- 915.51  \n- 8825.42  \n- 1327.36  \n- 1919.55  \n- 954.4  \n- 4751.4  \n- 925.88  \n- 3621.02  \n- 3698.73  \n- 4453.8  \n- 14924.55  \n- 8536.71  \n- 1961.17  \n- 5213.65  \n- 8915.4  \n- 452.85  \n- 925.88 (repeat) ??

The only source for these is rows with `type=\"Sale\"`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate total sales tax_amount**\n\nTo get an exact sum, list all tax_amount from sales rows in problem:\n\nFrom problem data:\n\n- Sale20240102003: 5235.38  \n- Sale20240102004: 1278.94  \n- Sale20240102005: 1293.13  \n- Sale20240103008: 5817.5  \n- Sale20240103009: 4603.34  \n- Sale20240103010: 1928.23  \n- Sale20240104013: 459.22  \n- Sale20240104014: 915.51  \n- Sale20240105017: 8825.42  \n- Sale20240105018: 1327.36  \n- Sale20240106021: 1919.55  \n- Sale20240106022: 954.4  \n- Sale20240106023: 4751.4  \n- Sale20240107025: 925.88  \n- Sale20240107026: 3621.02  \n- Sale20240108029: 3698.73  \n- Sale20240108030: 4453.8  \n- Sale20240108031: 14924.55  \n- Sale20240108032: 8536.71  \n- Sale20240111040: 1961.17  \n- Sale20240111041: 5213.65  \n- Sale20240112044: 8915.4  \n- Sale20240112045: 452.85  \n- Sale20240113046: 1897.79  \n- Sale20240114050: 4601.93  \n- Sale20240114051: 5513.59  \n- Sale20240114052: 2643.54  \n- Sale20240115056: 881.12  \n- Sale20240115057: 3440.75  \n- Sale20240115058: 942.64  \n- Sale20240116061: 1825.38  \n- Sale20240116062: 5663.9  \n- Sale20240117063: 14235.36  \n- Sale20240117064: 5226.38  \n- Sale20240117065: 1948.03  \n- Sale20240118068: 4436.44  \n- Sale20240118069: 13952.91  \n- Sale20240118070: 9107.96  \n- Sale20240118071: 3514.41  \n- Sale20240119074: 1784.51  \n- Sale20240119075: 3576.15  \n- Sale20240120080: 9331.74  \n- Sale20240121084: 1707.03  \n- Sale20240123094: 5747.36   \n- Sale20240123095: 1993.26  \n- Sale20240124099: 4316.38  \n- Sale20240124101: 9245.14  \n- Sale20240125105: 4934.77  \n- Sale20240125106: 1410.2  \n- Sale20240126109: 5369.73  \n- Sale20240126110: 13943.64  \n- Sale20240127114: 13423.74  \n- Sale20240127115: 5898.57  \n- Sale20240128119: 4548.41\n\nSum all these values:\n\nAdding all:\n\n5235.38  \n+1278.94 = 6514.32  \n+1293.13 = 7807.45  \n+5817.5 = 13624.95  \n+4603.34 = 18228.29  \n+1928.23 = 20156.52  \n+459.22 = 20615.74  \n+915.51 = 21531.25  \n+8825.42 = 30356.67  \n+1327.36 = 31684.03  \n+1919.55 = 33603.58  \n+954.4 = 34557.98  \n+4751.4 = 39309.38  \n+925.88 = 40235.26  \n+3621.02 = 43856.28  \n+3698.73 = 47555.01  \n+4453.8 = 52008.81  \n+14924.55 = 66933.36  \n+8536.71 = 75470.07  \n+1961.17 = 77431.24  \n+5213.65 = 82644.89  \n+8915.4 = 91560.29  \n+452.85 = 92013.14  \n+1897.79 = 93910.93  \n+4601.93 = 98512.86  \n+5513.59 = 104026.45  \n+2643.54 = 106669.99  \n+881.12 = 107551.11  \n+3440.75 = 110991.86  \n+942.64 = 111934.5  \n+1825.38 = 113759.88  \n+5663.9 = 119423.78  \n+14235.36 = 133659.14  \n+5226.38 = 138885.52  \n+1948.03 = 140833.55  \n+4436.44 = 145269.99  \n+13952.91 = 159222.9  \n+9107.96 = 168330.86  \n+3514.41 = 171845.27  \n+1784.51 = 173629.78  \n+3576.15 = 177205.93  \n+9331.74 = 186537.67  \n+1707.03 = 188244.7  \n+5747.36 = 193992.06  \n+1993.26 = 195985.32  \n+4316.38 = 200301.7  \n+9245.14 = 209546.84  \n+4934.77 = 214481.61  \n+1410.2 = 215891.81  \n+5369.73 = 221261.54  \n+13943.64 = 235205.18  \n+13423.74 = 248628.92  \n+5898.57 = 254527.49  \n+4548.41 = 259075.9\n\nSo total output tax = 259075.90\n\n**Step 5: Total input tax on purchases**\n\nFrom purchase transactions, tax_amount is empty, so assumed 0.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable**\n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Tax Payable = Total Output Tax - Total Input Tax  \n= 259075.90 - 0 = 259075.90\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"259075.90\"}}\n```\n\n# Explanation:\n\nThe final increase (decrease) in tax payable is calculated as total output tax from sales minus total input tax on purchases.
