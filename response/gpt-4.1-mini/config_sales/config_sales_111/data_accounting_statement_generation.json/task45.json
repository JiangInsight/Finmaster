From the data above:\n\n- 321,724.42 (Processing Equipment)\n- 115,740.01 (Production Line)\n\nTotal = 321,724.42 + 115,740.01 = 437,464.43\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Check for any fixed asset sales or inflows\n\nNo records show sale or disposal of fixed assets or other investing cash inflows.\n\nHence, total investing cash outflow = 437,464.43\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Net cash flow from investing activities\n\nNo inflows involving investing activities seen, so:\n\nNet Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -437,464.43\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-437464.43\"}}\n```}",
