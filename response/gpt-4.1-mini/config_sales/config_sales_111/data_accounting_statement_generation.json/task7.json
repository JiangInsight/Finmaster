In the given data, such entries have type starting with \"FixedAsset\" or \"Fixed Assets Purchase.\"  \n   Three such purchases on 2023-12-31:  \n   - 321,724.42 (\"Processing Equipment4\")  \n   - 115,740.01 (\"Production Line5\")  \n   There is no depreciation or disposal amount to reduce fixed assets specified here in amounts relevant to fixed assets. Depreciation entry exists, but typically for valuation on balance sheet, fixed assets are gross amounts unless stated otherwise. Since the example only adds purchases to the fixed assets initial amount, we'll follow the same approach.\n\n3. **Calculate the ending fixed assets:**  \n   Ending fixed assets = initial fixed assets + sum of fixed assets purchases  \n   = 5,000,000 + 321,724.42 + 115,740.01  \n   = 5,437,464.43\n\n4. **Round to two decimals:**  \n   Initial fixed assets = 5,000,000.00  \n   Ending fixed assets = 5,437,464.43\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"5437464.43\"}}\n```",
