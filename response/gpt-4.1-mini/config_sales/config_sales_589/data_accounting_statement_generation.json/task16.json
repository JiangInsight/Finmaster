                        "content": "To calculate the paid-in capital items (initial and end amounts), we follow:\n\n1. Identify initial amounts related to paid-in capital:\n   Typically, \"Initial\" entries reflect the initial equity or capital investments such as cash deposits, bank deposits, and fixed assets on the starting date.\n\n2. Confirm if any additional paid-in capital increased or decreased during the period:\n   Check if there are any transactions that relate to additional capital contributions or withdrawals (none labeled as such here).\n\n3. Since no new capital injection or withdrawal transactions are found (no entries labeled as capital contribution or withdrawal beyond the initial), the paid-in capital remains unchanged.\n\nFrom the problem data:\n\n- Initial amounts of paid-in capital:\n  - Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n  - Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n  - Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.0\n\nSum initial paid-in capital: 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.0\n\nNo transactions indicate change to paid-in capital.\n\nTherefore,\n\n- Initial value = 13,000,000.00\n- End value = 13,000,000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"13000000.00\"}}\n```",
