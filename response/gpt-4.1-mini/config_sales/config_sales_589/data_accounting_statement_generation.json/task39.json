There is no explicit opening balance for interest receivable on 12-31, so assume interest receivable at 2023-12-31 is zero (i.e., no prior interest receivable outstanding).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total interest receivable balance as of 2024-01-28\n\nSum all unpaid interest receivable amounts on or before 2024-01-28.\n\nThe \"Interest Receivables\" transactions (unpaid) and their amounts are:\n\n- 2024-01-01: 442.775\n- 2024-01-02: 442.775\n- 2024-01-03: 442.775\n- 2024-01-04: 442.775\n- 2024-01-05: 442.775\n- 2024-01-06: 433.875\n- 2024-01-07: 424.42158019999994\n- 2024-01-08: 424.42158019999994\n- 2024-01-09: 376.8065802\n- 2024-01-10: 376.8065802\n- 2024-01-11: 376.8065802\n- 2024-01-12: 376.8065802\n- 2024-01-13: 376.8065802\n- 2024-01-14: 376.8065802\n- 2024-01-15: 373.6915802\n- 2024-01-16: 373.6915802\n- 2024-01-17: 373.6915802\n- 2024-01-18: 373.6915802\n- 2024-01-19: 369.2415802\n- 2024-01-20: 369.2415802\n- 2024-01-21: 366.57158019999997\n- 2024-01-22: 350.5515802\n- 2024-01-23: 350.5515802\n- 2024-01-24: 350.5515802\n- 2024-01-25: 350.5515802\n- 2024-01-26: 350.5515802\n- 2024-01-27: 350.5515802\n- 2024-01-28: 350.5515802\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Sum these interest receivables (all unpaid)\n\nCalculate:\n\n442.775 * 5 (Jan 1 to Jan 5) = 2213.875  \n+ 433.875 (Jan 6) = 2647.75  \n+ 424.4215802 * 2 (Jan 7 & 8) = 848.8431604  \nTotal so far: 2647.75 + 848.8431604 = 3496.5931604  \n\n+ 376.8065802 * 7 (Jan 9 to Jan 15) = 2637.6460614  \nSum now: 3496.5931604 + 2637.6460614 = 6134.2392218  \n\n+ 373.6915802 * 4 (Jan 16 to Jan 19) = 1494.7663208  \nSum now: 6134.2392218 + 1494.7663208 = 7629.0055426  \n\n+ 369.2415802 * 2 (Jan 20-21) = 738.4831604  \nSum now: 7629.0055426 + 738.4831604 = 8367.488703  \n\n+ 350.5515802 * 8 (Jan 22 to Jan 28) = 2804.4126416  \nSum final: 8367.488703 + 2804.4126416 = 11171.9013446\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Since there was no opening balance (assumed 0), the increase in interest receivable is \n\n= Ending balance - Beginning balance = 11171.9013446 - 0 = 11171.90\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Confirm with example analysis:\n\nThe example shows the answer as negative indicating (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable is negative when balance increased.\n\nSo for this problem,\n\n**Change in Interest Receivable = -11171.90** (Negative to show increase in interest receivable reduces cash flow)\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-11171.90\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n# Summary:\n\nThe final interest receivable increased by 11,171.90, so the item in the cash flow statements is a negative cash flow effect of -11,171.90.",
