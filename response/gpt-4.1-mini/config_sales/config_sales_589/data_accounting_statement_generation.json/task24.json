The \"Total Cost\" here typically refers to the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), which comes from purchases cost amounts of products.\n\nFrom the given data, let's identify the purchase amounts that count towards the total cost:\n\nPurchases from each purchase line (all with type \"Purchase\"), focus only on their \"amount\":\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 25,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231002: 90,000.0 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231003: 30,000.0 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231004: 250,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231005: 60,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231006: 200,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231007: 400,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231008: 80,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231009: 100,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231010: 35,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231011: 500,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231012: 15,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231013: 90,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231014: 20,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231015: 100,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231016: 140,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231017: 35,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231018: 60,000.0 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231019: 50,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231020: 450,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231021: 30,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231022: 160,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231023: 20,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231024: 200,000.0 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231025: 50,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231026: 25,000.0 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231027: 140,000.0 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231028: 450,000.0 (Paid)\n\nNow, summing all purchase amounts (both Paid and Unpaid) because cost of goods sold typically includes purchases regardless of payment status:\n\nAdd all purchase amounts together:\n\n25,000 + 90,000 + 30,000 + 250,000 + 60,000 + 200,000 + 400,000 + 80,000 + 100,000 + 35,000 + 500,000 + 15,000 + 90,000 + 20,000 + 100,000 + 140,000 + 35,000 + 60,000 + 50,000 + 450,000 + 30,000 + 160,000 + 20,000 + 200,000 + 50,000 + 25,000 + 140,000 + 450,000\n\nCalculating stepwise:\n\n- 25,000 + 90,000 = 115,000\n- +30,000 = 145,000\n- +250,000 = 395,000\n- +60,000 = 455,000\n- +200,000 = 655,000\n- +400,000 = 1,055,000\n- +80,000 = 1,135,000\n- +100,000 = 1,235,000\n- +35,000 = 1,270,000\n- +500,000 = 1,770,000\n- +15,000 = 1,785,000\n- +90,000 = 1,875,000\n- +20,000 = 1,895,000\n- +100,000 = 1,995,000\n- +140,000 = 2,135,000\n- +35,000 = 2,170,000\n- +60,000 = 2,230,000\n- +50,000 = 2,280,000\n- +450,000 = 2,730,000\n- +30,000 = 2,760,000\n- +160,000 = 2,920,000\n- +20,000 = 2,940,000\n- +200,000 = 3,140,000\n- +50,000 = 3,190,000\n- +25,000 = 3,215,000\n- +140,000 = 3,355,000\n- +450,000 = 3,805,000\n\nTotal purchases = 3,805,000\n\nTherefore, the \"Total Cost\" in the income statement based on the transactions provided is 3,805,000.\n\nNote: We do not include expenses that are administrative, sales, financial, depreciation, or interest.
