                        "content": "To calculate the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" we need to identify transactions related to investing cash flows. Typically, investing activities include:\n\n- Purchase or sale of fixed assets or property, plant, and equipment (cash outflows are purchases; cash inflows are sales).\n- Purchase or sale of investments.\n- Loans made to others and collections of principal.\n\nGiven the data, the Investing Activities include specifically transactions related to \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or \"Fixed Assets\".\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify all transactions related to investing activities (fixed assets purchases and sales)\n\nFrom the dataset, look for records with:\n- type related to fixed assets purchase/sale: e.g., `\"FixedAsset20231231001\"` or `\"Fixed Assets Purchase\"`, `\"Fixed Assets\"`.\n- By quick scan, the relevant entries labeled:\n\n| id                 | type                  | date       | amount     | payment_method  | asset_name       | asset_type      |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|------------|------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 106218.2   | Bank Transfer   | Production Line4 | Production Line |\n\nNote: There might be only one explicit fixed assets purchase in this data with amount 106,218.2 paid via bank transfer.\n\nNo other rows show clear fixed asset purchase or sale.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Sum cash inflows from sale of investing assets\n\nNo entries indicate sales of fixed assets or investments in the provided data.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Sum cash outflows for purchase of fixed assets\n\nOnly one fixed asset purchase with amount 106,218.2.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nNet cash flow from investing activities = (Cash inflows from sales) - (Cash outflows for purchase)\n\n= 0 - 106,218.2 = -106,218.2\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-106218.2\"}}\n````",
