These include Cash deposit, Bank deposit, and Fixed Assets — all typically asset accounts, not liabilities.\n- There is no explicit initial liability amount given (e.g., no initial account payable or loan balances).\n- Hence, the **total liabilities initial value** is 0.00.\n\n**Step 2: Identify liabilities in the transactions**  \n- Liabilities typically come from:\n  - Unpaid purchases with payment method \"Account Payable\"\n  - Purchases marked \"Unpaid\" with payment method \"Account Payable\"\n  - Any other unpaid items that imply liability\n\n**Step 3: Sum all unpaid purchases (liabilities) during the period**  \nFrom the transactions given:  \nLook for entries with:  \n- type \"Purchase\"  \n- payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\"  \n- payment_method = \"Account Payable\"  \n\nRelevant purchases (unpaid and Account Payable):\n\n| id             | amount     | payment_method  | payment/receipt_status |\n|----------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| Purchase20231231002 | 90000.0   | Account Payable  | Unpaid                |\n| Purchase20231231003 | 30000.0   | Account Payable  | Unpaid                |\n| Purchase20231231018 | 60000.0   | Account Payable  | Unpaid                |\n| Purchase20231231024 | 200000.0  | Account Payable  | Unpaid                |\n| Purchase20231231026 | 25000.0   | Account Payable  | Unpaid                |\n| Purchase20231231027 | 140000.0  | Account Payable  | Unpaid                |\n\nSum these amounts:  \n90,000 + 30,000 + 60,000 + 200,000 + 25,000 + 140,000 = 545,000\n\n**Step 4: Check if other unpaid purchases (or liabilities) exist:**\n\nAlso, some \"Purchase\" with status \"Unpaid\" but payment_method is not \"Account Payable\" — these are not liabilities but likely something else.\n\nIn this dataset, the unpaid purchases with \"Account Payable\" are the ones counted as liabilities.\n\n**Therefore, the total liabilities end value is the sum of these unpaid account payables: 545,000.00**\n\n---\n\n**Final Output:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"545000.00\"}}\n```}",
