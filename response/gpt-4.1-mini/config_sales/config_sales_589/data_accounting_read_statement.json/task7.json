We are asked to identify and extract the specific line items and value of expense in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, including initial and final values.\n\n2. From the provided balance sheet data, the relevant line for expenses in the income statement which affects retained earnings is usually related to \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" or changes in \"Retained Earnings\" which show the net effect of profits or losses during the period.\n\n3. The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" increased from 0.00 (initial) to 45749.30 (end), similar to the example provided, which indicates an expense (depreciation expense).\n\n4. The \"Retained Earnings\" changed from 0.00 to 1193771.08, indicating net profits after expenses and income items.\n\n5. Since the task is to extract the line item and value of expense, the best match here representing an expense value is the \"Accumulated Depreciation\":\n\n- Initial value: 0.00  \n- End value: 45749.30\n\nTherefore, the expense represented in the income statement that can be inferred from the balance sheet is depreciation expense.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"45749.30\"}}\n```",
