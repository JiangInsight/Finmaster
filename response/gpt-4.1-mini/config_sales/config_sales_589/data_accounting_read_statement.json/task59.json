The amount of interest accrued but not yet received — this corresponds to \"Interest Receivable\" from the Balance Sheet or alternatively \"Interest Income\" from the Income Statement (should be consistent) and \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" on the Cash Flow Statement to confirm the changes.\n\n2. The net addition (net increase or decrease) in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period — given explicitly under the Cash Flow Statement section with the line item \"Net Increase\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section.\n\n---\n\nStep 1: Find value1 (Interest accrued but not yet received).\n\n- Balance Sheet line: \"Interest Receivable\" shows an end amount of 10,811.11.\n\n- Income Statement line: \"Interest Income\" is also 10,811.11.\n\n- Cash Flow has \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" as -10,811.11 (a negative value because it increased).\n\nGiven the problem wants the value of interest accrued but not yet received, the line \"Interest Receivable\" from Balance Sheet is exactly the accrued amount not yet received at period-end, so value1 = 10811.11.\n\n---\n\nStep 2: Find value2 (Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period).\n\n- Cash Flow Statement, under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section:\n\n  - Beginning Balance: 8,000,000.00\n\n  - Ending Balance: 7,669,648.58\n\n  - Net Increase: -330,351.42\n\nSo the net change in cash and cash equivalents is a decrease of 330,351.42, i.e., value2 = -330351.42.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"10811.11\", \"value2\": \"-330351.42\"}}\n```",
