The problem asks to identify and extract two specific line items and their values:\n   - Value of income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities.\n   - Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\n2. From the income statement provided, the line item that represents the income arising from core operating activities is typically \"Main Business Revenue\" (or \"Main Operating Revenue\").\n\n3. The carrying amount of inventories sold is captured by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" line item.\n\n4. Given the problem input:\n\n| Account               | Amount     | Date       |\n|-----------------------|------------|------------|\n| Main Business Revenue  | 5695115.02 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Total Revenue         | 5695115.02 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold     | 3085000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Total Cost             | 3085000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| ...                   | ...        | ...        |\n\n5. Extract \"Main Business Revenue\" amount = 5695115.02.\n\n6. Extract \"Cost of Goods Sold\" amount = 3085000.00.\n\n7. Keep the original order: first value1 is income from operating activities (Main Business Revenue), then value2 is carrying amount of inventories sold (Cost of Goods Sold).\n\nHence, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"5695115.02\", \"value2\": \"3085000.00\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"5695115.02\", \"value2\": \"3085000.00\"} }\n```",
