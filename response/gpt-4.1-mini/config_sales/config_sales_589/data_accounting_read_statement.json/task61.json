The task is to identify and extract:\n   - The cost incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services to customers (which typically corresponds to \"Selling Expenses\" in the income statement).\n   - The cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets (which usually appears as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the cash flow statement under investing activities).\n\n2. Checking the **Income Statement** for costs related to securing customer orders and delivering goods/services:\n   - The relevant line is \"Selling Expenses\" with the value: 555218.93\n\n3. Checking the **Cash Flow Statement** for cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment:\n   - The relevant line is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with the value: 106218.20\n\n4. The Balance Sheet does not have the requested line items, so only outputs from Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement are needed.\n\nThus,\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"555218.93\", \"value2\": \"106218.20\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\nFinal answer: \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '555218.93', 'value2': '106218.20'} }\n```",
