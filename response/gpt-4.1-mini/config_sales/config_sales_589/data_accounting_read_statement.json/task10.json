Typically, this is shown under the \"Paid-in Capital\" line item.\n3. From the provided data:\n   - Initial \"Paid-in Capital\" amount on 2023-12-31 is 13000000.00\n   - End \"Paid-in Capital\" amount on 2024-01-28 is also 13000000.00\n4. This shows that the capital contributed by shareholders has not changed during the period.\n\nTherefore, the initial and final capital contributed by shareholders is 13,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"13000000.00\", \"end value\": \"13000000.00\"} }\n```",
