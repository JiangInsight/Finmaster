The task asks to identify and extract the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities related to:\n   - Acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents.\n   - Receipt of interest and dividends.\n\n2. From the cash flow statement, these activities typically appear under **Cash Flow from Investing Activities**.\n\n3. From the problem, the relevant line items related to investing activities are:\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 106,218.20 (This is an outflow, so cash decreases)\n   - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -106,218.20\n\n4. There is no explicit mention of receipt of interest and dividends as a separate item here.\n\n5. The net cash flow from investing activities is -106,218.20, which matches the purchase of fixed assets (the single sub-item available).\n\n6. Therefore:\n   - The net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from investing activities is -106,218.20.\n   - The one sub-item contributing is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with amount 106,218.20 (positive in the table, but cash outflow accounts for negative sign in net).\n\n7. According to instructions, output the net value as a string with negative sign as it is shown in the net cash flow line, and sub-item value as the positive amount as shown in the input (since \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is positive).\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-106218.20\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"106218.20\"}}\n```",
