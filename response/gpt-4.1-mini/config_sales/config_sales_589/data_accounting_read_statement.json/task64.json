Balance Sheet - Paid-in Capital: 13000000.00\n2. Income Statement - Profit Before Tax: 1478526.85\n3. Cash Flow Statement - addition in amount owed (accounts payable) is 545000.00\n\nTherefore, final solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"13000000.00\", \"value2\": \"1478526.85\", \"value3\": \"545000.00\"}}\n```",
