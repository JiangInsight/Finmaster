                        "content": "To identify the costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services, we look for line items related to selling and distribution.\n\n- Costs to secure customer orders mainly fall under \"Selling Expenses\".\n- Costs to deliver goods and services may include \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS), but primarily the question focuses on ordering and delivery costs, which are typically \"Selling Expenses.\"\n\nFrom the income statement provided:\n\n- Selling Expenses = 555218.93  \n- Cost of Goods Sold = 3085000.00\n\nSince the problem states \"costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services,\" both categories are relevant:\n\n- Securing customer orders = Selling Expenses = 555218.93  \n- Delivering goods = Cost of Goods Sold = 3085000.00\n\nTherefore, the total costs incurred specifically related to these activities are:\n\n555218.93 + 3085000.00 = 3640218.93\n\nHowever, usually, \"Cost of Goods Sold\" represents the direct cost to produce the goods or services, which is basically the cost to deliver them.\n\n\"Administrative Expenses\" likely do not relate directly to securing orders or delivery.\n\nHence, the answer could be presented as combined.\n\nBut the example solution from the prompt picks only \"Selling Expenses\" when asked for costs to secure customer orders and deliver the goods and services, implying \"Selling Expenses\" is the relevant amount.\n\nSince in real accounting, \"Selling Expenses\" are related to selling and distribution, while COGS relates to production.\n\nBut the problem description says: \"Based on the income statement, identify and extract the specific line items and value of costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers.\"\n\nSo both \"Selling Expenses\" and \"Cost of Goods Sold\" are the correct costs.\n\nTherefore, the solution would be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3085000.00, 555218.93'}}\n```\n\nBut as per the example, they present only one figure.\n\nSo maybe the problem expects just \"Selling Expenses\" (cost to secure customer orders and deliver goods) which includes logistics, marketing, and sales costs.\n\nFinal decision: Since it requests to \"identify and extract specific line items\" and the \"value\" (singular), the best match is \"Selling Expenses\" which represents the cost of selling and delivering the goods.\n\nHence the value = 555218.93\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '555218.93'} }\n```\n\n# Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '555218.93'} }\n```",
