Here, only current liabilities are provided (Total Current Liabilities = 829,755.77). The balance sheet does not show any long-term liabilities explicitly; thus, we will assume that Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 829,755.77.\n\n---\n\nStep 1: Extract Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -224,133.22\n\nStep 2: Extract Total Debt:\n\n- Total Current Liabilities = 829,755.77\n- No long-term liabilities listed, so Total Debt = 829,755.77\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-224,133.22}{829,755.77} = -0.2702\n\\]\n\n---\n\nRounded to two decimal places:\n\n\\[\n-0.27\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Interpretation:** The ratio is negative and less than 1, indicating that the operating cash flow is negative compared to debt, which may be a concern for liquidity.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.27\"}}\n```",
