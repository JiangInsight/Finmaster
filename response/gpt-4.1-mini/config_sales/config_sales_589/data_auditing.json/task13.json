The calculated/expected tax is 2609.77.\n- The recorded category should be \"Sale\".\n- The recorded tax amount should be corrected to 2609.77.\n- Other fields like date, payment status, payment method, quantity, price, profit, preparer, and approver are consistent and correct as recorded.\n\nNo other internal inconsistencies or errors were detected in the provided transactions.",
