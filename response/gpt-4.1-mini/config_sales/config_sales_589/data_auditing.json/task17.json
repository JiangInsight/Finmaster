This is likely a correction for the problem data (note the originally posted example problem data had a discrepancy amount versus quantity * unit price). The given problem input in this request has amount = 25000 which is consistent.\n\nNo internal inconsistency or error is detected within the given data for this specific set. Thus the output shows data consistent with as is.\n\nIf required to capture an inconsistency (from original problem dataset), for example the first example Purchase20231231001 had amount 290000 with quantity 29 and unit price 10000 - that sums 290000 but cost_per_unit was 10000 which matched, no inconsistency there.\n\nGiven no inconsistencies in the provided problem data, solution shows the data is correct.\n\nIf other inconsistencies needed to be reported, they would be included similarly with their detected error.\n\nSince that is not the case here, the output shows no corrections needed.\n```",
