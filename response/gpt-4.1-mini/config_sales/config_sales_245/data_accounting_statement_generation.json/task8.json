Since this is a new batch of data starting from 2023-12-31, the initial accumulated depreciation is typically zero unless stated otherwise.\n\nLooking at the initial records on 2023-12-31, there's no explicit accumulated depreciation record. So we take:\n\n- Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value = 0.00\n\nStep 2: Final Value of Accumulated Depreciation\n\nLook through the dataset for depreciation transactions.\n\nThere is exactly one relevant record:\n\n- id: Depreciation20240101001 | type: Depreciation | date: 2024-01-01 | amount: 45757.71\n\nThis suggests that the depreciation recorded for the period is 45757.71.\n\nSince no other depreciation entries are present, and no removals or adjustments were noted, the accumulated depreciation end value is this amount.\n\nNote: No other depreciation or accumulated depreciation records to add or subtract.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"45757.71\"}}",
