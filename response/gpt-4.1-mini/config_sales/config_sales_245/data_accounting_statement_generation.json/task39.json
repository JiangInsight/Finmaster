So starting balance of Interest Receivable is 0.\n\nFor the ending balance (latest date in 2024-01-29):\n\n- We gather all interest receivable entries, which are all labeled \"Interest Receivables\" and \"Unpaid\" status.\n\nThe latest date is 2024-01-29 with an Interest Receivables entry:\n\n- 2024-01-29, Interest Receivables amounts include several occurrences with status \"Unpaid\":\n\nSumming all **unpaid** interest receivables for the final date 2024-01-29 to compute the ending balance of Interest Receivable:\n\nFrom the data for 2024-01-29:\n\n- Interest20240129029: 325.295 (approx)\n- No other Interest Receivables on 2024-01-29 explicitly listed in problem, assume all entries for Interest Receivables of that date included.\n\nBut since the data includes multiple rows of interest receivable entries across various dates, and they accumulate.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Total Interest Receivables at 2024-01-01**\n\nSum all Interest Receivables amounts with dates on or before 2024-01-01 and with status \"Unpaid\".\n\n- 2024-01-01 Interest Receivables: 427.2 (Unpaid)\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Total Interest Receivables at 2024-01-29 (end of period)**\n\nSum all Interest Receivables amounts recorded **up to 2024-01-29** that are **unpaid and outstanding**.\n\nFrom the data, the last Interest Receivables entries are at 2024-01-29 with amount 325.295 (unpaid).\n\nHowever, this task wants the net change of interest receivable balances.\n\n**Step 4: Sum of all Interest Receivable entries accrued during January 2024**\n\nLook at all Interest Receivables entries from 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-29.\n\nListed Interest Receivables amounts for each date (all unpaid):\n\n- 2024-01-01: 427.2  \n- 2024-01-02: 376.47  \n- 2024-01-03: 376.47  \n- 2024-01-04: 358.67  \n- 2024-01-05: 358.67  \n- 2024-01-06: 358.67  \n- 2024-01-07: 358.67  \n- 2024-01-08: 358.67  \n- 2024-01-09: 358.67  \n- 2024-01-10: 358.67  \n- 2024-01-11: 346.21  \n- 2024-01-12: 346.21  \n- 2024-01-13: 346.21  \n- 2024-01-14: 335.53  \n- 2024-01-15: 335.53  \n- 2024-01-16: 335.53  \n- 2024-01-17: 335.53  \n- 2024-01-18: 335.53  \n- 2024-01-19: 335.53  \n- 2024-01-20: 335.53  \n- 2024-01-21: 335.53  \n- 2024-01-22: 334.20  \n- 2024-01-23: 334.20  \n- 2024-01-24: 334.20  \n- 2024-01-25: 334.20  \n- 2024-01-26: 325.29  \n- 2024-01-27: 325.29  \n- 2024-01-28: 325.29  \n- 2024-01-29: 325.29  \n\n**Step 5: Find Interest Receivables balance at 2023-12-31 (starting balance):**\n\nThere is no mention of Interest Receivable at 2023-12-31 in problem data â€” assume zero.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the ending Interest Receivables balance**\n\nThe ending balance will be the sum of all Interest Receivable entries (unpaid) in the period starting 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-29, **minus any interest receivable collected/paid during the period**.\n\nBut since the problem data does not mention payments of interest receivables, assume none paid during the period.\n\nThus, ending balance = sum of all interest receivables amounts during period.\n\nCalculate sum:\n\nSum = 427.2 + 376.47 + 376.47 + 358.67 + 358.67 + 358.67 + 358.67 + 358.67 + 358.67 + 358.67 + 346.21 + 346.21 + 346.21 + 335.53 + 335.53 + 335.53 + 335.53 + 335.53 + 335.53 + 335.53 + 335.53 + 334.20 + 334.20 + 334.20 + 334.20 + 334.20 + 325.29 + 325.29 + 325.29 + 325.29\n\nCount and sum:\n\n- Count of each amount:\n\nDates 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-10: 10 entries  \n- 427.2 + 376.47*2 + 358.67*7 =  \n427.2 + 752.94 + (358.67*7=2510.69) = 427.2 + 752.94 + 2510.69 = 3690.83  \n\nDates 2024-01-11 to 2024-01-21: 11 entries  \n- 346.21*3 + 335.53*7 + 334.20*1 (from 22nd gotta split carefully)  \nBut 22nd is 334.20, so Jan 11-21 is up to Jan 21: entries are 346.21 * 3 (11,12,13), 335.53 * 7 (14-20), and 335.53 on the 21st as well? Actually Jan 21 is 335.53 per data. Count from 11 to 21 is 11 days.  \nSo Jan 11-13: 3 days * 346.21 = 1038.63  \nJan 14-21: 8 days * 335.53 = 2684.24  \nSum = 1038.63 + 2684.24 = 3722.87  \n\nDates 2024-01-22 to 2024-01-25: 4 days * 334.20 = 1336.8  \n\nDates 2024-01-26 to 2024-01-29: 4 days * 325.29 = 1301.16  \n\nTotal sum:\n\n= 3690.83 + 3722.87 + 1336.8 + 1301.16 = 10051.66 approx.\n\n**Step 7: The change (Increase) in Interest Receivable**\n\nStarting balance = 0 (assumed, as none at end 2023-12-31)  \nEnding balance = 10051.66  \n\nIncrease in Interest Receivable = Ending balance - Starting balance = 10051.66 - 0 = 10051.66\n\n**Step 8: Final Result**\n\nThe increase in Interest Receivable is 10051.66.\n\n**Answer format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"10051.66\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n# Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"10051.66\"}}\n```",
