But here most expenses are \"Paid\".\n  \n**From the data:**\n\nUnpaid Purchases with \"Unpaid\" status or payment method \"Account Payable\":\n\n| id               | amount    | payment/receipt_status | payment_method |\n|------------------|-----------|-----------------------|----------------|\n| Purchase20231231005 | 35000.0  | Unpaid                | Account Payable|\n| Purchase20231231009 | 50000.0  | Unpaid                | Account Payable|\n| Purchase20231231012 | 35000.0  | Unpaid                | Account Payable|\n| Purchase20231231013 | 45000.0  | Unpaid                | Account Payable|\n| Purchase20231231014 | 400000.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable|\n| Purchase20231231020 | 30000.0  | Unpaid                | Account Payable|\n| Purchase20231231026 | 140000.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable|\n| Purchase20231231018 | 90000.0  | Unpaid                | Account Payable|\n\n Sum these amounts:\n\n35000 + 50000 + 35000 + 45000 + 400000 + 30000 + 140000 + 90000 =\n\n= 35000 + 50000 = 85000  \n85000 + 35000 = 120000  \n120000 + 45000 = 165000  \n165000 + 400000 = 565000  \n565000 + 30000 = 595000  \n595000 + 140000 = 735000  \n735000 + 90000 = 825000\n\n**Note:** I misadded previously, checking carefully:\n\n35000 + 50000 = 85000  \n85000 + 35000 = 120000  \n120000 + 45000 = 165000  \n165000 + 400000 = 565000  \n565000 + 30000 = 595000  \n595000 + 140000 = 735000  \n735000 + 90000 = 825000\n\nThere are actually 8 unpaid purchases, so total unpaid purchase amount = 825,000\n\nNo other unpaid expenses seem to be listed as current liabilities.\n\n**Step 3: Confirm no other current liabilities**\n\nNo other entries with \"Unpaid\" expense or liabilities.\n\n**Step 4: Final totals**\n\n- Initial Current Liabilities = 0.00 (No unpaid purchases or payables initially)\n- Ending Current Liabilities = 825,000.00\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"825000.00\"}}\n```\n",
