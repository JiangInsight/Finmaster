cash inflows.  \n- Expenses and purchases paid by \"Cash\" decrease cash balance.  \n- Unpaid and Account Receivable sales are not considered cash inflows.  \n- Bank Transfer purchases reduce bank deposits but since both cash and bank deposit are cash equivalents, total still the same. We only considered cash method purchases because bank purchases do not affect cash cash balance, but combined should affect cash equivalents; however, we consider bank deposit as part of cash equivalents from initial.  \n\nSince the prompt asks for cash and cash equivalents combined, and no explicit bank transfers or cash to bank transfers are provided here, bank purchases by Bank Transfer reduce bank cash equivalents, so subtract those purchases paid by bank transfer to get the net cash equivalents.\n\nPurchases paid by bank transfer:  \n- Purchase20231231001: 200,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231002: 500,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231003: 70,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231006: 200,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231014: unpaid - ignore  \n- Purchase20231231024: 100,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231026: unpaid - ignore  \n- Purchase20231231010: 140,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231012: unpaid - ignore  \n- Purchase20231231020: unpaid - ignore  \n- Purchase20231231021: 160,000.0   \n- Purchase20231231004: 100,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231006: 200,000.0 (another one)  \n\nSum purchase paid by bank transfer =  \n200,000+500,000+70,000+200,000+100,000+140,000+160,000+100,000+200,000 = 1,670,000\n\nSubtract this from the total cash equivalents as these purchases paid reduce bank deposit (bank cash equivalent).\n\nSo:  \nTotal cash equivalents = initial + cash inflows - cash expenses - cash purchases - bank purchases  \n= 8,000,000 + 4,601,816.99 - 1,113,281.67 - 865,000.0 - 1,670,000.0  \n= 8,000,000 + 4,601,816.99 - 3,648,281.67  \n= 8,000,000 + 953,535.32  \n= 8,953,535.32\n\n---\n\n**Final precise calculation:**  \n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"8953535.32\"} }\n```\n\n# We will provide final solution as above.\n\n---\n\n### Final solution:  \n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"8953535.32\"} }\n```",
