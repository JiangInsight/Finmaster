But since it is for inventory, we need starting inventory cost amounts based on initial purchase records, but as initial inventory not stated, assume it to be 0.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Total Purchases\n\nSum all Purchase amounts (Purchase entries) by cost_amount or amount.\n\nFrom the problem data, purchases (amount) are:\n\n1.
