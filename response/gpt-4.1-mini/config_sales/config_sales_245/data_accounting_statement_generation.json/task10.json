                        "content": "To calculate the \"property, plant and non-current assets\" item on the balance sheet including both initial and final amounts, we do the following:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the initial value of non-current assets**\n\n- From initial records, the \"Fixed Assets\" amount at 2023-12-31 is 5,000,000.0.  \n- Thus, initial value of non-current assets = 5,000,000.00\n\n**Step 2: Calculate changes related to non-current assets during the period**\n\nNon-current asset changes usually come from:\n- Purchases of fixed assets or property, plant and equipment (capital expenditures)\n- Depreciation (deduction)\n\nFrom the problem data:\n\n- Purchases related to non-current assets can be found in:\n  - The explicit \"Fixed Assets\" purchase record at initial date (we only have one initial fixed asset).\n  - The \"Purchase\" records with product related to fixed assets or capital expenditures.\n\nHere, the problem does not explicitly mark which purchases are capital assets except fixed asset purchases are not shown (except initial fixed asset).  \nSo we only consider the \"Initial\" fixed asset explicitly recorded: 5,000,000.\n\n- Depreciation:\n  - There is an entry on 2024-01-01:  \n    Depreciation amount = 45,757.71 (reduces asset value)\n\n- Fixed Asset Purchases (capital additions) must be found if any:\n  - In problem data, there is no explicit \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" line that states fixed assets additions, only product purchases are listed.\n\nTherefore, the only value movements for non-current assets during the period are:\n- Initial fixed assets: 5,000,000.00\n- Less depreciation: 45,757.71\n- Plus no additional fixed asset purchase found\n\nFinal value after depreciation:  \n5,000,000 - 45,757.71 = 4,954,242.29\n\nBut maybe some purchases in the \"Purchase\" transactions relate to plant and equipment?  \nLooking at purchase records:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 200,000.0, product Premium Product C (likely inventory, not fixed asset)\n- Purchase20231231002: 500,000.0, product Premium Product D (likely inventory)\n- Purchase20231231003: 70,000.0, Premium Product B (inventory)\n- Purchase20231231004: 100,000.0, Premium Product B\n- Purchase20231231005: 35,000.0, Premium Product A\n- Purchase20231231006: 200,000.0, Premium Product D\n- Purchase20231231007: 180,000.0, Premium Product C\n- Purchase20231231008: 30,000.0, Premium Product B\n- Purchase20231231009: 50,000.0, Premium Product A\n- Purchase20231231010: 140,000.0, Premium Product C\n- Purchase20231231011: 100,000.0, Premium Product B\n- Purchase20231231012: 35,000.0, Premium Product A\n- Purchase20231231013: 45,000.0, Premium Product A\n- Purchase20231231014: 400,000.0, Premium Product D\n- Purchase20231231015: 120,000.0, Premium Product C\n- Purchase20231231016: 200,000.0, Premium Product D\n- Purchase20231231017: 450,000.0, Premium Product D\n- Purchase20231231018: 90,000.0, Premium Product B\n- Purchase20231231019: 15,000.0, Premium Product A\n- Purchase20231231020: 30,000.0, Premium Product A\n- Purchase20231231021: 160,000.0, Premium Product C  \n- Purchase20231231022: 350,000.0, Premium Product D  \n- Purchase20231231023: 35,000.0, Premium Product A  \n- Purchase20231231024: 100,000.0, Premium Product B  \n- Purchase20231231025: 450,000.0, Premium Product D  \n- Purchase20231231026: 140,000.0, Premium Product C\n\nAll above purchases are inventory or trading goods (\"Premium Product\"), not property, plant, and equipment. So none should be capitalized as fixed assets.\n\n**No explicit fixed asset purchases found during the period.**\n\nHence the only adjustment is depreciation.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Final non-current assets amount**\n\nInitial 5,000,000.00  \nLess depreciation 45,757.71  \n= 4,954,242.29 (rounded to two decimals: 4954242.29)\n\n---\n\n**Final solution:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"4954242.29\"}}\n```\n\n# Summary:\n- Initial fixed assets: 5,000,000.00  \n- No fixed assets purchases during period (only inventory purchases)  \n- Depreciation expense reduces asset value by 45,757.71  \n- Ending net book value = 4,954,242.29",
