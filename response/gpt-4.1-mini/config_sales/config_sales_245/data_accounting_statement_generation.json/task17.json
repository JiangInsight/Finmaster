As per accounting practice, if no retained earnings opening balance is stated, assume 0 initial retained earnings.\n\n**Initial retained earnings:** 0.00\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Net Profit for the period**\n\nTo calculate net profit, sum all revenues (sales and interest income) and subtract all expenses (cost of goods sold, purchases do not directly affect income as they relate to inventory but expenses and cost of sales are relevant).\n\n---\n\n- Sales:\n\nThere are multiple sales entries. We look at the 'profit' column in sales entries to sum the total profit.\n\nFrom the problem data, sales profit amounts (approximate from given profits in sales entries):\n\nSum all profits from sales entries (including both paid and unpaid sales):\n\n(Note: We only have partial lines, but all sales lines show a profit value with the 'profit' column.)\n\nSum of all sales profits from the given data (adding the 'profit' amounts for sales entries):\n\nPartial profits from some sale rows:\n\n- 19170.93\n- 30156.46\n- 17948.22\n- 79770.40\n- 14253.22\n- 49003.17\n- 12699.57\n- 16361.26\n- 21744.18\n- 37812.29\n- 29291.76\n- 14655.41\n- 28924.88\n- 25908.80\n- 28924.88\n- 107759.46\n- 4327.25\n- 146895.3\n- 47119.22\n- 48243.33\n- 95738.23\n- 18343.61\n- 41847.66\n- 36426.43\n- 87255.28\n- 109290.33\n\nAdd these up:\n\n19170.93 + 30156.46 = 49267.39  \n49267.39 + 17948.22 = 67215.61  \n67215.61 + 79770.40 = 146986.01  \n146986.01 + 14253.22 = 161239.23  \n161239.23 + 49003.17 = 210242.40  \n210242.40 + 12699.57 = 222941.97  \n222941.97 + 16361.26 = 239303.23  \n239303.23 + 21744.18 = 261047.41  \n261047.41 + 37812.29 = 298859.70  \n298859.70 + 29291.76 = 328151.46  \n328151.46 + 14655.41 = 342806.87  \n342806.87 + 28924.88 = 371731.75  \n371731.75 + 25908.80 = 397640.55  \n397640.55 + 107759.46 = 505400.01  \n505400.01 + 4327.25 = 509727.26  \n509727.26 + 146895.30 = 656622.56  \n656622.56 + 47119.22 = 703741.78  \n703741.78 + 48243.33 = 751985.11  \n751985.11 + 95738.23 = 847723.34  \n847723.34 + 18343.61 = 866066.95  \n866066.95 + 41847.66 = 907914.61  \n907914.61 + 36426.43 = 944341.04  \n944341.04 + 87255.28 = 1031596.32  \n1031596.32 + 109290.33 = 1140886.65\n\n**Sum of Sales Profits ≈ 1,140,886.65**\n\n---\n\n- Interest Receivables (Income):\n\nSum interest amounts (positive only, unpaid or paid considered as income for retention).
