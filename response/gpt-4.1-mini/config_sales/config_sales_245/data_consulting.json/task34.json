                        "content": "First, let's identify and calculate each requested ratio step by step using the given data.\n\n---\n\n### Given Data (End of period values):\n\n- **Balance Sheet:**\n\n  - Total Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n  - Total Owner's Equity = 14,163,543.07\n  - Total Assets = 15,288,131.32\n  - Accounts Receivable = 1,133,414.13\n  - Interest Receivable = 10,051.66\n  - Inventory = 975,000.00\n  - Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits (Cash and Cash Equivalents) = 4,560,423.24 + 3,655,000.00 = 8,215,423.24\n  - Accounts Payable = 825,000.00\n  - Taxes Payable = 299,588.25\n\n- **Income Statement:**\n\n  - Net Profit = 1,163,543.07\n  - Total Revenue = 5,991,764.34\n  - Cost of Goods Sold = 3,250,000.00\n\n- **Cash Flow Statement:**\n\n  - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 215,423.24\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step calculations:\n\n#### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nFormula:  \n= Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\n= 215,423.24 / 1,124,588.25  \n≈ 0.1915 (rounded to 4 decimals)\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nAssuming debt here means total liabilities, and from the balance sheet:  \n\nTotal Liabilities = Total Assets - Owner's Equity  \n= 15,288,131.32 - 14,163,543.07 = 1,124,588.25 (which matches current liabilities - assume all liabilities are current here)\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Owner's Equity  \n= 1,124,588.25 / 14,163,543.07  \n≈ 0.0794 (rounded)\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\nFormula:  \n= Total Revenue / Average Total Assets\n\nSince only end amounts are given, we'll assume initial total assets = 13,000,000.00 (from initial balance sheet) and end total assets = 15,288,131.32\n\nAverage Total Assets = (13,000,000 + 15,288,131.32) / 2 = 14,144,065.66\n\nTotal Asset Turnover = 5,991,764.34 / 14,144,065.66  \n≈ 0.4235  \n\n---\n\n#### 4. Quick Ratio\n\nFormula:  \nQuick Assets = Cash and Cash Equivalents + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable  \n= 8,215,423.24 + 1,133,414.13 + 10,051.66  \n= 9,358,889.03\n\nQuick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities  \n= 9,358,889.03 / 1,124,588.25  \n≈ 8.32  \n\n---\n\n#### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nFormula:  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\nThis is the same as Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio (usually the same)\n\n= 215,423.24 / 1,124,588.25 = 0.1915\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n\nFormula:  \nROE = Net Profit / Average Owner's Equity\n\nAverage Owner's Equity = (13,000,000 + 14,163,543.07) / 2 = 13,581,771.54\n\nROE = 1,163,543.07 / 13,581,771.54 = 0.0857 = 8.57%\n\n---\n\n#### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\nFormula:  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover = Total Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nInitial Accounts Receivable = 0.00  \nEnd Accounts Receivable = 1,133,414.13  \nAverage Accounts Receivable = (0 + 1,133,414.13) / 2 = 566,707.07\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover = 5,991,764.34 / 566,707.07 ≈ 10.57\n\n---\n\n### Final answers rounded suitably:\n\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: 0.19  \n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.08  \n- Total Asset Turnover Ratio: 0.42  \n- Quick Ratio: 8.32  \n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: 0.19  \n- Return on Equity (ROE): 8.57%  \n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: 10.57  \n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"0.19\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.08\", \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.42\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"8.32\", \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"0.19\", \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"8.57%\", \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"10.57\"}}\n```",
