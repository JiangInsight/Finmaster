                        "content": "To compute the ratios, we'll use the formulas below and the data provided:\n\n---\n\n### Given Data (using Ending Balances mostly):\n\n**From Balance Sheet (End amounts):**\n- Cash on Hand = 4,560,423.24  \n- Bank Deposits = 3,655,000.00  \n- Interest Receivable = 10,051.66  \n- Accounts Receivable = 1,133,414.13  \n- Inventory = 975,000.00  \n- Total Current Assets = 10,333,889.03  \n- Fixed Assets = 5,000,000.00  \n- Accumulated Depreciation = 45,757.71  \n- Total Non-current Assets = 4,954,242.29  \n- Total Assets = 15,288,131.32  \n\n- Accounts Payable = 825,000.00  \n- Taxes Payable = 299,588.25  \n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25  \n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,163,543.07  \n- Total Liabilities and Equity = 15,288,131.32  \n\n**From Cash Flow:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 215,423.24  \n\n**From Income Statement:**\n- Net Profit = 1,163,543.07  \n- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = 3,250,000.00  \n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\n= 215,423.24 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 0.1915\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Liabilities\n\nTotal Liabilities can be assumed mostly as current liabilities here since no long-term liabilities given.\n\nTotal Liabilities = Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n\nSo:\n\n= 215,423.24 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 0.1915\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nSince opening inventory is zero (0.00), average inventory = (0 + 975,000) / 2 = 487,500\n\nInventory Turnover = 3,250,000 / 487,500 ≈ 6.67\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n\nTotal Liabilities = 1,124,588.25  \nOwner's Equity = 14,163,543.07\n\n= 1,124,588.25 / 14,163,543.07 ≈ 0.0794\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Quick Ratio\n\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\n= (10,333,889.03 - 975,000) / 1,124,588.25  \n= 9,358,889.03 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 8.32\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Current Ratio\n\nCurrent Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\n= 10,333,889.03 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 9.19\n\n---\n\n### Final answers rounded to two decimals:\n\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: 0.19  \n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: 0.19  \n- Inventory Turnover Ratio: 6.67  \n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.08  \n- Quick Ratio: 8.32  \n- Current Ratio: 9.19  \n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"0.19\", \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"0.19\", \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"6.67\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.08\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"8.32\", \"Current Ratio\": \"9.19\"}}\n```",
