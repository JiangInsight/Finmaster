Scan the provided cash flow statement lines to identify any mention of assets held for sale or equivalent terms such as inventory changes, assets in production for sale, or assets being manufactured.\n\n2. The closest relevant line item here is \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with a value of -975000.00. Inventory typically includes assets held for sale or those in the process of being manufactured or produced for sale.\n\n3. The negative value (-975000.00) suggests an increase in inventory (uses cash), while a positive value would indicate a reduction (release of cash), but since we're looking for the reduction in such assets, the actual value here should be considered as the amount representing change in assets held for sale or in production.\n\n4. Since the problem asks for the reduction, and here we have a negative number (an increase in inventory), it implies no reduction but an increase.\n\n5. However, this is the only relevant line available. The problem states to extract the value of the reduction; if no reduction is listed, that would mean it is zero or no reduction observed in the period.\n\nTherefore, the reduction in the amount of assets held for sale (i.e., inventory) is 0, as the only value related (inventory) shows an increase.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
