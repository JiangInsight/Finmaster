Usually, \"Interest Receivable\" represents interest income that has been earned but not yet received in cash.\n3. In the given balance sheet data:\n   - Initial value of \"Interest Receivable\" as of 2023-12-31 is 0.00.\n   - End value of \"Interest Receivable\" as of 2024-01-29 is 10,051.66.\n4. No other line item specifically refers to interest accrued but not received.\n   \nThus, the values for interest accrued but not yet received are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"10051.66\"}}\n```",
