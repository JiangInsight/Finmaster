Other equity items such as \"Retained Earnings\" represent accumulated profits, not capital paid by shareholders.\n\nStep 4: Since there is no change in \"Paid-in Capital\" between the initial and ending dates, the initial and final value are the same.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:  \n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'} }\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"13000000.00\", \"end value\": \"13000000.00\"}}\n```",
