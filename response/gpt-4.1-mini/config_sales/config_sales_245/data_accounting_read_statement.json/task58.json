In the balance sheet, the initial amounts for cash-related items on the initial date (2023-12-31) are:\n   - Cash on Hand: 3,000,000.00\n   - Bank Deposits: 5,000,000.00\n   - Total Current Assets initial amount is 8,000,000.00, which coincides with the sum of Cash on Hand and Bank Deposits (3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000).\n\n2. In the cash flow statement section, the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" beginning balance at the date 2024-01-29 is clearly stated as 8,000,000.00.\n\n3. This \"Beginning Balance\" in the cash flow statement corresponds to the \"cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period\".\n\nHence, the required value is 8,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"8000000.00\"}}\n```",
