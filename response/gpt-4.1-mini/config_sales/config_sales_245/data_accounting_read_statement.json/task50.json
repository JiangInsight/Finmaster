From the problem data, the amount is **45757.71**.\n\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period** is reflected by the change in **Inventory** (often listed as (Increase) Decrease in Inventory). From the data, this is **-975000.00**.\n\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends** is typically represented by **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**. From the data, this is **-0.00**.\n\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period** is usually **Net Increase** in cash and equivalents. From the data, this is **215423.24**.\n\nPutting these in order as per the original line items in the statement:\n\n- value1: Depreciation = \"45757.71\"\n- value2: (Increase) Decrease in Inventory = \"-975000.00\"\n- value3: Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = \"-0.00\"\n- value4: Net Increase (in cash and cash equivalents) = \"215423.24\"\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"45757.71\", \"value2\": \"-975000.00\", \"value3\": \"-0.00\", \"value4\": \"215423.24\"}}\n```",
