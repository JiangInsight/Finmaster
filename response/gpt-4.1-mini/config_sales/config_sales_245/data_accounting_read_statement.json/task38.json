This corresponds to the change in accounts receivable.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement, the relevant line item is:\n- (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\n\nThe value for this line item is:\n- -1133414.13\n\nThis negative value indicates that accounts receivable increased by 1,133,414.13 during the period, meaning the amounts owed to the entity have increased, not decreased.\n\nHowever, the task asks specifically for the value of the decrease in amounts owed, which is represented by the \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" line item.\n\nSince the value is negative, it actually means an increase in amounts owed to the entity, so the decrease in amounts owed is negative: -1133414.13.\n\nThus, the answer to extract is the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with the value -1133414.13.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-1133414.13\"}}\n```",
