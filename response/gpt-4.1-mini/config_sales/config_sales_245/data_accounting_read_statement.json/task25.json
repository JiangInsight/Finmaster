Commonly, Selling Expenses capture securing customers and some delivery-related expenses, while Cost of Goods Sold captures production/delivery costs.\n\nGiven the example, the solution picks \"Selling Expenses\" as the cost incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services.\n\nIn the problem, Selling Expenses = 782,775.93\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"782775.93\"}}\n```",
