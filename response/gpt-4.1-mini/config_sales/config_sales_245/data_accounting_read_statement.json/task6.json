Typically, these items are represented by \"Fixed Assets\" in a balance sheet.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n- From the given problem, the line item that aligns with tangible assets held for use is \"Fixed Assets\".\n- Initial value of Fixed Assets on 2023-12-31 is 5,000,000.00\n- End value of Fixed Assets on 2024-01-29 is also 5,000,000.00\n- Accumulated Depreciation is shown, but we are asked for the tangible asset values themselves, so the gross values (Fixed Assets) are appropriate here.\n\nHence, the initial and final value of the tangible items held for use is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5000000.00'} }\n```",
