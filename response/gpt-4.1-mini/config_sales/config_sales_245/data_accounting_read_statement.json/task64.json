Since the task requests grouping by financial statement and maintaining the order as per input, the value should be from the Balance Sheet's change or Cash Flow Statement line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" which is:  \n   - Accounts Payable end amount = 825000.00 (initial amount 0.00, so increase is 825000.00)  \n   or directly as seen in Cash Flow Statement \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" = 825000.00\n\nHence,  \n- From **Balance Sheet**: Paid-in Capital = 13000000.00  \n- From **Income Statement**: Profit Before Tax = 1463131.32  \n- From **Cash Flow Statement**: Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable = 825000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"13000000.00\", \"value2\": \"1463131.32\", \"value3\": \"825000.00\"}}\n```",
