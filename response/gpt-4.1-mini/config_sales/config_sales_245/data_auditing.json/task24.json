But in this problem data I see no such inconsistent record.\n- Thus, for the provided problem data, there are no inconsistencies or errors found.\n- So the output notes the transaction ID Sale20240102002 as consistent with no corrections needed (all original values = recorded values).\n- If there were inconsistencies, I would list them with recorded and corrected values as per instruction. But here none found.",
