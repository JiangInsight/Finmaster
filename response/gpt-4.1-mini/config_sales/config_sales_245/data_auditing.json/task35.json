If forced to provide output, I provide the first record as base (no inconsistency).\n\nIf the task expects only inconsistent records, then output an empty solution {} or {\"solution\": {}}.\n\nBut since the instruction is to present step-by-step and answer, and to output only inconsistencies, the right output is empty.\n\nSo better to output:\n\n{\"solution\": {}}\n\nMeaning no errors are found in the problem data.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {}}\n```\n",
