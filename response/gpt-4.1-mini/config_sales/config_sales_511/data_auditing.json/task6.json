Here we trust the row value over description text.\n  \n- No inconsistencies found in values for quantity, price, amounts, or dates.\n\n- Other transactions have no visible inconsistencies from the supplied data. The price, amount, and quantity calculations are consistent throughout.\n\nThis response includes one corrected inconsistency found: the recorded_preparer of Purchase20231231002 should be \"Supervisor\" (as recorded), but description mentions \"Senior Staff\". Considering the instruction to trust the standard fields (row data) over narrative, the recorded_preparer should remain as \"Supervisor\".",
