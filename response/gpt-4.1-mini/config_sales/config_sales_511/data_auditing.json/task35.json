This is consistent.\n- No other fields show inconsistency.\n- Other rows showed inconsistencies in the original data problem description, but here, based on provided fields, only Purchase20231231001 aligns perfectly.\n- The fields appear correct and consistent per invoice total = quantity * unit price.\n- So no inconsistency detected for Purchase20231231001.\n\nFor other rows:\n\n- Purchase20231231002 recorded_amount: 50000.0, recorded_quantity: 10.0, recorded_unit_price: 5000.0 - which is consistent.\n- Purchase20231231003 recorded_amount: 100000.0, recorded_quantity: 10.0, price 10000.0 - consistent.\n- No other discrepancies found in the shown data.\n\nHence, the only entry fully verified is Purchase20231231001 with no errors; no inconsistencies detected in the given data to correct.\n\nIf multiple entries are expected to be output, please clarify; otherwise, all given transactions appear consistent with their computed amounts and data. The data provided in the problem statement are consistent.\n\n(Note: If you wanted to identify all inconsistencies for all rows, please clarify accordingly.)",
