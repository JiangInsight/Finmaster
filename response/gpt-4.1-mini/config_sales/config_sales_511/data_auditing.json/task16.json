However, since task expects an output per inconsistency found, and no inconsistencies are found, the safe output is an empty or no error response.\n\nAlternatively, since the example output expects reporting inconsistencies only, and none exist here, report an empty solution.\n\nIf strictly must report something, the above example transaction ID with corrections matching recorded data is shown.\n\n# Final:\nNo inconsistencies found in the given data; no corrections needed.\n```",
