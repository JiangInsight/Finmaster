The recorded amount (130957.43) is inconsistent with 6x unit price 20000.0 (which is 120000.0).\n- Based on consistency with quantity, unit price, and description, the original amount should be 120000.0 and price 20000.0.\n- Other fields match and deemed correct.\n\nAll other entries appear consistent on basic checks based on the data provided.",
