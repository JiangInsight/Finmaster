These liabilities are typically captured under \"Accounts Payable\" on the balance sheet.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Look for line items that represent payables or liabilities related to credit purchases.\n2. From the provided data, \"Accounts Payable\" is the most relevant line item.\n3. Extract the initial amount as of 2023-12-31 and the end amount as of 2024-01-27.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- Accounts Payable initial amount = 0.00\n- Accounts Payable end amount = 450000.00\n\nNo other line item specifically indicates amounts owed for goods/services on credit.\n\nHence,\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"450000.00\"}}\n```",
