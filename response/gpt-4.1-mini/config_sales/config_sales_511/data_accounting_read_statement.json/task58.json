From the balance sheet, the date for the \"Initial_amount\" is 2023-12-31.\n2. The cash and cash equivalents generally include \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" line items.\n3. From the balance sheet's Initial_amount fields for 2023-12-31:\n   - Cash on Hand = 3,000,000.00\n   - Bank Deposits = 5,000,000.00\n4. Adding these gives total cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period:\n   3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 8,000,000.00\n5. The cash flow section also confirms the \"Beginning Balance\" for Cash and Cash Equivalents as 8,000,000.00 on 2024-01-27, matching the initial amounts above.\n\nThus, the value of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period is 8,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"8000000.00\"}}\n```",
