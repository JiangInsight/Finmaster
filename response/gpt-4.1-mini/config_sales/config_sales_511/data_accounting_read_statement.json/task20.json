Typically, the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) represents the cost of inventory that was sold during the period.\n\n3. In the problem, the income statement includes a line \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with amount 3020000.00.\n\n4. Therefore, the value of carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is 3020000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"3020000.00\"}}\n```",
