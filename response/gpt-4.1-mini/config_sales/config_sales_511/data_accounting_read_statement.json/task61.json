The cost incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services to customers.  \n   This is typically reflected as \"Selling Expenses\" in the Income Statement.\n\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.  \n   This is usually captured as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" (or similar) in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify the cost related to securing customer orders and delivering goods/services\nIn the **Income Statement**, the relevant line items for costs related to customer orders and delivery are generally \"Selling Expenses\" or possibly \"Administrative Expenses\" but most relevant is \"Selling Expenses\" as it directly relates to selling and delivery.\n\n- Selling Expenses: 662,884.34\n\n### Step 2: Identify cash payments for acquiring property, plant, and equipment\nIn the **Cash Flow Statement** under investing activities:\n\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 676,195.87\n\n---\n\n### Final values:\n\n- value1 (costs to secure and deliver): 662,884.34  \n- value2 (cash payments for fixed assets): 676,195.87\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"662884.34\", \"value2\": \"676195.87\"}}\n```",
