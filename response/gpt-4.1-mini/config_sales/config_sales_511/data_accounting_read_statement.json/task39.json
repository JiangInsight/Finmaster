Such line items are usually recorded as changes in inventory or similar accounts.\n\nIn the provided cash flow statement, the closest relevant item is:  \n- (Increase) Decrease in Inventory | -440000.00\n\nA negative value here means an increase in inventory (assets held for sale or in production increased). However, the task requests the \"reduction\" in the amount of such assets, i.e., a decrease (positive number).\n\nGiven the line, the value is -440000.00, indicating an increase in inventory, not a reduction.\n\nThere is no other line item that explicitly indicates a reduction in inventory or assets held for sale.\n\nBecause the question states to \"identify and extract\" the line item of the reduction, if the cash flow statement does not show a reduction but rather an increase, the answer should be that the reduction is not present or zero.\n\nHowever, per examples provided, it extracts the value as is from the inventory line.\n\nSince the inventory line is the relevant one to this task, we should return it accordingly.\n\nHence, the answer is:  \n{\"solution\": {'value': '-440000.00'}}\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-440000.00\"}}\n```",
