Costs to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services typically come under \"Selling Expenses\" because these include marketing, sales commissions, distribution, and delivery costs.\n2. Sometimes, \"Cost of Goods Sold\" represents costs related to producing the goods but not the order securing and delivery itself.\n3. Therefore, the relevant line item here is \"Selling Expenses.\"\n\nFrom the problem data:  \n| Account           | Amount     | Date       |  \n|-------------------|------------|------------|  \n| Selling Expenses  | 662884.34  | 2024-01-27 |\n\nHence, the value to extract is 662884.34.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"662884.34\"}}\n```",
