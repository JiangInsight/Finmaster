The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is generally represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) on the income statement.\n2. From the provided income statement data:\n   - Cost of Goods Sold = 3,020,000.00\n\nTherefore, the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is 3,020,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"3020000.00\"}}\n```",
