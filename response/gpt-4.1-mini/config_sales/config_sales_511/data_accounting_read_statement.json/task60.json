Balance Sheet  \n2. Income Statement  \n3. Cash Flow Statement  \n\nAnd maintain original line item order if multiple outputs per group (here only one each):\n\n- From Balance Sheet: Bank Deposits: 2,938,804.13  \n- From Income Statement: Interest Income: 8,592.81\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"2938804.13\", \"value2\": \"8592.81\"}}\n```\n\n# Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"2938804.13\", \"value2\": \"8592.81\"}}\n```",
