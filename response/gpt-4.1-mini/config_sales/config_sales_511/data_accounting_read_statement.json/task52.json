The relevant line item for capital contributed by shareholders is usually labeled as \"Paid-in Capital\" or \"Share Capital\".\n2. In the provided balance sheet table:\n   - The \"Paid-in Capital\" account has an Initial_amount of 13,000,000.00 on 2023-12-31.\n   - The \"Paid-in Capital\" account has an End_amount of 13,000,000.00 on 2024-01-27.\n3. This shows that the capital contributed by shareholders has not changed from the initial to the ending date.\n4. Therefore, the initial value is 13,000,000.00 and the end value is also 13,000,000.00.\n\nNo other line item appears to represent capital contributed by shareholders.\n\nHence, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
