Since tax amount is given for sales only, the tax payable is calculated as sum of sales tax_amount minus any input VAT (if known).\n\nSince input VAT is not provided explicitly, we approximate input VAT as zero (or ignore it).\n\nAlternatively, since this problem context is similar to given example, we just sum tax_amount on sales transactions.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Sum tax_amount on

However, many purchase lines have cost_per_unit and quantity.\n\nAssuming that purchases are exclusive of tax and tax rate is same as output VAT (assumable 9.5%), but since no tax_amount given, probably input VAT is not recognized for this problem or is zero.\n\nAlternatively, since in the example solution, the increase (decrease) in tax payable is the total sales tax amount less total purchase tax amount (which was not separately given) resulting in 271550.92.\n\nSince in this problem we do not have explicit purchase tax, we can assume purchase tax as zero or very small or ignore.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Tax Payable = Sum Output VAT (sales tax_amount) - Sum Input VAT (purchase tax_amount assumed 0)  \n= 276822.89 - 0  \n= 276822.89\n\nRounded to 2 decimals: 276822.89\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"276822.89\"}}\n```",
