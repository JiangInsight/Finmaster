Cash and bank deposits are affected by:\n   - Sales proceeds received in cash or bank (payment/receipt_status: Paid, payment_method: Cash or Bank Transfer)\n   - Purchases paid (expense of cash or bank, but purchases increase inventory)\n   - Expenses paid (Administrative, Sales, Financial expenses reduce cash/bank)\n   - Transfers between cash and bank do not change total current assets\n\n2. Accounts Receivable (A/R):\n   - Sales marked as \"Unpaid\" (payment/receipt_status = Unpaid) represent accounts receivable and thus are current assets.\n\n3. Interest Receivables:\n   - Unpaid interest receivables are current assets.\n\n4. Inventory:\n   - Purchases increase inventory by the cost amount.\n   - Sales decrease inventory by cost_amount (cost of goods sold).\n\n5. Fixed Assets are excluded.\n\n---\n\n**Let's aggregate stepwise:**\n\n### 1) Initial current assets:\n- Cash Deposit + Bank Deposit = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000.00\n\n---\n\n### 2) Inventory calculation:\n\n**Initial inventory not given, so assume initial inventory is zero or included in initial assets (not marked).**\n\n**Purchases:**\n\nSum all purchases amounts (amount field) purchased in the period:\n\nPurchases (Purchase type):\n\n| id | amount |\n| --- | --- |\n| Purchase20231231001 | 160,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231002 | 50,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231003 | 100,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231004 | 250,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231005 | 350,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231006 | 80,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231007 | 90,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231008 | 120,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231009 | 60,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231010 | 100,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231012 | 200,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231013 | 250,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231014 | 60,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231015 | 80,000.0 | (Unpaid but still inventory)\n| Purchase20231231016 | 25,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231017 | 25,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231018 | 60,000.0 | (Unpaid but still inventory)\n| Purchase20231231019 | 400,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231020 | 60,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231021 | 100,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231022 | 350,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231023 | 45,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231024 | 300,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231025 | 15,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231026 | 50,000.0 |\n\nSum of all Purchases = \n\n160,000 + 50,000 + 100,000 + 250,000 + 350,000 + 80,000 + 90,000 + 120,000 + 60,000 + 100,000 + 200,000 + 250,000 + 60,000 + 80,000 + 25,000 + 25,000 + 60,000 + 400,000 + 60,000 + 100,000 + 350,000 + 45,000 + 300,000 + 15,000 + 50,000\n\nCalculate total:\n\n- 160,000 + 50,000 = 210,000\n- +100,000 = 310,000\n- +250,000 = 560,000\n- +350,000 = 910,000\n- +80,000 = 990,000\n- +90,000 = 1,080,000\n- +120,000 = 1,200,000\n- +60,000 = 1,260,000\n- +100,000 = 1,360,000\n- +200,000 = 1,560,000\n- +250,000 = 1,810,000\n- +60,000 = 1,870,000\n- +80,000 = 1,950,000\n- +25,000 = 1,975,000\n- +25,000 = 2,000,000\n- +60,000 = 2,060,000\n- +400,000 = 2,460,000\n- +60,000 = 2,520,000\n- +100,000 = 2,620,000\n- +350,000 = 2,970,000\n- +45,000 = 3,015,000\n- +300,000 = 3,315,000\n- +15,000 = 3,330,000\n- +50,000 = 3,380,000\n\nSo total purchases = 3,380,000.00\n\n---\n\n**Sales Cost (reduce inventory):**\n\nSum all sales cost_amount (field: cost_amount):\n\nSales (Sale type):\n\nPick all Sales and sum cost_amount:\n\nLet's sum all 'cost_amount' values:\n\n- 20000.0\n- 30000.0\n- 10000.0\n- 40000.0\n- 20000.0\n- 50000.0\n- 80000.0\n- 40000.0\n- 10000.0\n- 30000.0\n- 60000.0\n- 20000.0\n- 10000.0\n- 15000.0\n- 150000.0\n- 50000.0\n- 50000.0\n- 5000.0\n- 10000.0\n- 20000.0\n- 60000.0\n- 100000.0\n- 50000.0\n- 100000.0\n- 150000.0\n- 150000.0\n- 100000.0\n- 10000.0\n- 5000.0\n- 10000.0\n- 5000.0\n- 5000.0\n- 5000.0\n- 60000.0\n- 50000.0\n- 30000.0\n- 30000.0\n- 5000.0\n- 50000.0\n- 10000.0\n- 50000.0\n- 50000.0\n- 50000.0\n- 20000.0\n- 5000.0\n- 10000.0\n- 50000.0\n- 50000.0\n- 10000.0\n- 15000.0\n- 5000.0\n- 10000.0\n- 50000.0\n- 10000.0\n- 10000.0\n- 20000.0\n- 50000.0\n- 10000.0\n- 5000.0\n- 5000.0\n- 10000.0\n- 5000.0\n- 5000.0\n\nNow sum these values:\n\nSumming all cost_amount values:\n\nFrom the data:\n\nSales cost_amount summary:\n\n20000 + 30000 = 50000  \n+10000 = 60000  \n+40000 = 100000  \n+20000 = 120000  \n+50000 = 170000  \n+80000 = 250000  \n+40000 = 290000  \n+10000 = 300000  \n+30000 = 330000  \n+60000 = 390000  \n+20000 = 410000  \n+10000 = 420000  \n+15000 = 435000  \n+150000 = 585000  \n+50000 = 635000  \n+50000 = 685000  \n+5000 = 690000  \n+10000 = 700000  \n+20000 = 720000  \n+60000 = 780000  \n+100000 = 880000  \n+50000 = 930000  \n+100000 = 1030000  \n+150000 = 1180000  \n+150000 = 1330000  \n+100000 = 1430000  \n+10000 = 1440000  \n+5000 = 1445000  \n+10000 = 1455000  \n+5000 = 1460000  \n+5000 = 1465000  \n+5000 = 1470000  \n+60000 = 1530000  \n+50000 = 1580000  \n+30000 = 1610000  \n+30000 = 1640000  \n+5000 = 1645000  \n+50000 = 1695000  \n+10000 = 1705000  \n+50000 = 1755000  \n+50000 = 1805000  \n+50000 = 1855000  \n+20000 = 1875000  \n+5000 = 1880000  \n+10000 = 1890000  \n+50000 = 1940000  \n+50000 = 1990000  \n+10000 = 2000000  \n+15000 = 2015000  \n+5000 = 2020000  \n+10000 = 2030000  \n+50000 = 2080000  \n+10000 = 2090000  \n+10000 = 2100000  \n+20000 = 2120000  \n+50000 = 2170000  \n+10000 = 2180000  \n+5000 = 2185000  \n+5000 = 2190000  \n+10000 = 2200000  \n+5000 = 2205000  \n+5000 = 2210000\n\nTotal sales cost_amount = 2,210,000.00 (approximate sum)\n\n---\n\n### 3) Accounts Receivable (Unpaid Sales):\n\nSum of all sales amount where payment/receipt_status is \"Unpaid\":\n\nFrom data, sales unpaid amounts:\n\n- 19969.83 (Sale20240102004) Paid but let's confirm if unpaid.
