                        "content": "To calculate the final net increase in cash and cash equivalents, we need to consider all transactions that affect the cash or cash equivalents.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Identify initial cash and bank deposits (cash inflow at start):\n   - Cash deposit: +3,000,000.0\n   - Bank deposit: +5,000,000.0\n   - Sum initial inflow: 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = +8,000,000.0\n\n2. Identify cash and bank inflows:\n   - Sales receipts that are \"Paid\" and received via Cash or Bank (note: payment_method for Sales is missing in problem data, but receive_method provided for sales includes 'Cash' or 'Account Receivable'. Only cash receipts count as cash inflow.)\n\n   - From sales:\n     - Cash sales with payment/receipt status \"Paid\" and receive_method \"Cash\" increase cash.\n   - Also, consistent with common practice, transfer between cash and bank does not increase net cash; it's only a movement.\n\n3. Identify cash and bank outflows:\n   - Purchases paid by Cash or Bank Transfer reduce cash or bank respectively.\n   - Expenses paid by Cash reduce cash.\n   - Fixed assets purchased paid by Bank Transfer reduce cash equivalents (bank).\n   - Transfers between Cash and Bank do not change total cash and cash equivalentsâ€”cancel out.\n\n4. Ignore:\n   - Unpaid purchases or unpaid expenses and unpaid sales (like account receivable or payable).\n   - Interest receivables unpaid are not cash affecting yet.\n   - Depreciation and similar non-cash expenses.\n\n---\n\nNow, we must sum all real cash and cash equivalent inflows and outflows.\n\n---\n\n**Detailed Calculation:**\n\n- Initial cash and bank balance (opening cash and bank):\n  - Cash Deposit: 3,000,000\n  - Bank Deposit: 5,000,000\n  - Total opening cash & cash equivalents = 8,000,000\n\n---\n\n**Cash and Bank inflows:**\n\n- Sum of Paid sales where receive_method = \"Cash\":\n  Extract sales entries with payment/receipt_status = \"Paid\" and receive_method = \"Cash\".\n\nSales on 2024-01-02:\n- Sale20240102002: Paid, Cash, amount=36215.84\n- Sale20240102003: Paid, Cash, amount=59124.48\n- Sale20240102004: Paid, Cash, amount=19969.83\n- Sale20240102005: Paid, Cash, amount=72765.04\n\nSum = 36215.84 + 59124.48 + 19969.83 + 72765.04 = 188,075.19\n\nSales on 2024-01-03:\n- Sale20240103007: Paid, Cash, amount=74406.36\n\nSales on 2024-01-04:\n- Sale20240104010: Paid, Cash, 34944.94\n- Sale20240104011: Paid, Cash, 35220.92\n- Sale20240104012: Paid, Cash, 77327.76\n\nSum = 34944.94 + 35220.92 + 77327.76 = 147,493.62\n\nSales on 2024-01-05:\n- Sale20240105016: Paid, Cash, 119794.38\n- Sale20240105017: Paid, Cash, 18210.04\n\nSum = 119,794.38 + 18,210.04 = 138,004.42\n\nSales on 2024-01-06:\n- Sale20240106021: Paid, Cash, 175,639.68\n- Sale20240106022: Paid, Cash, 180,204.56\n- Sale20240106023: Paid, Cash, 8,723.75\n- Sale20240106024: Paid, Cash, 34,976.77\n\nSum = 175,639.68 + 180,204.56 + 8,723.75 + 34,976.77 = 399,544.76\n\nSales on 2024-01-07:\n- Sale20240107029: Paid, Cash, 18,296.79\n- Sale20240107030: Paid, Cash (No, Account Receivable)\n- So just 18,296.79\n\nSales on 2024-01-08:\n- Sale20240108032: Paid, Cash, 17,718.59\n- Sale20240108033: Paid, Cash, 103,073.34\n- Sale20240108034: Paid, Cash, 38,051.64\n\nSum = 17,718.59 + 103,073.34 + 38,051.64 = 158,843.57\n\nSales on 2024-01-09:\n- Sale20240109035: Paid, Cash, 59,099.85\n- Sale20240109036: Paid, Cash, 8,870.11\n\nSum= 67,969.96\n\nSales on 2024-01-10:\n- No Paid cash sales (all unpaid sales)\n- Sale20240111044 (2024-01-11): Paid, Cash, 28,265.49\n- Sale20240111045: Paid, Cash, 196,469.06\n- Sale20240111046: Paid, Cash, 183,722.86\n\nSum (Jan 11) = 28,265.49 + 196,469.06 + 183,722.86 = 408,457.41\n\nSales on 2024-01-12:\n- Sale20240112048: Paid, Cash, 39,531.9\n- Sale20240112049: Paid, Cash, 18,136.94\n- Sale20240112050: Paid, Cash, 102,464.10\n\nSum = 160,132.94\n\nSales on 2024-01-13:\n- Sale20240113053: Paid, Cash, 35,406.18\n- Sale20240113054: Paid, Cash, 109,147.29\n\nSum = 144,553.47\n\nSales on 2024-01-14:\n- Sale20240114056: Paid, Cash, 51,955.23\n\nSales on 2024-01-15:\n- Sale20240115060: Paid, Cash, 85,787.44\n- Sale20240115061: Paid, Cash, 180,059.6\n- Sale20240115062: Paid, Cash, 288,034.92\n\nSum = 553,881.96\n\nSales on 2024-01-16:\n- Sale20240116064: Paid, Cash, 9,991.92\n- Sale20240116065: Paid, Cash, 19,331.28\n\nSum= 29,323.2\n\nSales on 2024-01-17:\n- Sale20240117067: Paid, Cash, 18,062.03\n- Sale20240117068: Paid, Cash, 9,051.66\n\nSum= 27,113.69\n\nSales on 2024-01-18:\n- Sale20240118071: Paid, Cash, 197,627.2\n- Sale20240118072: Paid, Cash, 37,388.12\n- Sale20240118073: Paid, Cash, 58,375.14\n\nSum = 293,390.46\n\nSales on 2024-01-19:\n- Sale20240119075: Paid, Cash, 188,177.44\n- Sale20240119076: Paid, Cash, 263,727.12\n- Sale20240119077: Paid, Cash, 39,034.46\n- Sale20240119078: Paid, Cash, 18,326.66\n\nSum = 509,265.68\n\nSales on 2024-01-20:\n- Sale20240120080: Paid, Cash, 53,687.91\n- Sale20240120081: Paid, Cash, 35,219.04\n\nSum= 88,906.95\n\nSales on 2024-01-21:\n- Sale20240121083: Paid, Cash, 27,826.5\n- Sale20240121084: Paid, Cash, 85,459.24\n- Sale20240121086: Paid, Cash, 9,229.85\n\nSum= 122,515.59\n\nSales on 2024-01-22:\n- Sale20240122089: Paid, Cash, 9,973.68\n- Sale20240122037: Paid, Cash, 119,369.05 (From original problem data: yes Paid, Cash for 119,369.05)\n- Sale20240122036 is unpaid, so skip.\n\nNote: Here the 119,369.05 from original data is unpaid on account receivable.
