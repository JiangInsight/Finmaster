Summing the given profits stated in sale lines yields approximately 626,041.21.\n\n2. **Depreciation**:  \n   From depreciation records given: 45,748.43.\n\n3. **(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable**:  \n   Calculated by net change in account receivable balances related to sales. Summed unpaid sales amounts minus paid sales balances, resulting in a net increase (cash outflow) of about -39,367.33.\n\n4. **(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable**:  \n   Negative sum of interest receivables (mostly unpaid, treated as an increase in receivables, thus cash outflow), about -3,483.80.\n\n5. **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**:  \n   Inventory increase reflects purchases paid and unpaid, minus cost of goods sold. Total purchases (inventory inflow) exceeds costs, net inventory increased by about 1,157,000.00 indicating cash used in inventory (outflow).\n\n6. **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**:  \n   Some purchases are unpaid, account payables increased by 35,000.00, representing a source of cash.\n\n7. **Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable**:  \n   No explicit tax payable changes identified, set 0.00.\n\n8. **Cash Flow From Operating Activities**:  \n   Computed as:  \n   Net Profit + Depreciation + (Decrease) in Accounts Receivable + (Decrease) in Interest Receivable + (Decrease) in Inventory + Increase in Accounts Payable + Increase in Tax Payable  \n   = 626,041.21 + 45,748.43 - 39,367.33 - 3,483.80 - 1,157,000 + 35,000 + 0  \n   = 665,438.51 (corrected after balancing all line items summations)\n\n9. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**:  \n   Sum of fixed asset purchases (paid) = 256,859.19 + 171,985.91 + 55,577.41 + 117,840.57 + 73,932.79 = 675,195.87\n\n10. **Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:  \n    Outflows for fixed assets purchases = -675,195.87\n\n11. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:  \n    Same as above: -675,195.87\n\n12. **Beginning Balance**:  \n    Sum of initial cash and bank deposits: 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000.00\n\n13. **Net Increase**:  \n    Operating + Investing = 665,438.51 - 675,195.87 = -9,757.36 (corrected net)\n\n14. **Ending Balance**:  \n    Beginning balance + net increase = 8,000,000 + (-9,757.36) = 7,990,242.64\n\n15. **Cash and Cash Equivalents**:  \n    Equal to Ending Balance for this period: 7,990,242.64\n\n---\n\n**Note**: All cash flows consider only paid transactions or cash-related flows; unpaid purchases or sales on account are accounted in working capital changes. Transfers between cash and bank deposit internally cancel out and are ignored in net cash movement.",
