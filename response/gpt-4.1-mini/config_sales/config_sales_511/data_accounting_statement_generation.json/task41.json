Identify all purchases that are **Unpaid** (these increase accounts payable).\n2. Identify all purchases that are **Paid** (these represent payments made and therefore reduce accounts payable).\n3. Calculate:\n   - Total unpaid purchase amounts (which increase accounts payable).\n   - Total paid purchase amounts (which decrease accounts payable).\n4. Since we are asked for the change in accounts payable, we consider only purchases as accounts payable relates to amounts owed for purchases.\n5. The net increase (decrease) = Unpaid Purchases - Paid Purchases.\n\n---\n\nStep 1 & 2: Extract purchases and check payment status:\n\nFrom the problem data:\n\n- Purchases **Unpaid** (payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\" or payment_method indicating \"Account Payable\"):\n  - Purchase20231231009: 60,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n  - Purchase20231231013: 250,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n  - Purchase20231231015: 80,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n  - Purchase20231231018: 60,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n  - Purchase20231231024: (No unpaid status here, it's Paid)\n  - Any other purchase with status Unpaid or payment method \"Account Payable\".\n\nLooking carefully for all unpaid purchases:\n\n- Purchase20231231009: 60,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231013: 250,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231015: 80,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231018: 60,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n\nSum unpaid purchases = 60,000 + 250,000 + 80,000 + 60,000 = 450,000.0\n\nStep 3: Purchases **Paid**:\n\nLook for Purchases with payment/receipt_status = \"Paid\" (or payment method other than \"Account Payable\"):\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 160,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231002: 50,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231003: 100,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231004: 250,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231005: 350,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231006: 80,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231007: 90,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231008: 120,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231010: 100,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231012: 200,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231014: 60,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231016: 25,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231017: 25,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231019: 400,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231020: 60,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231021: 100,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231022: 350,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231023: 45,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231026: 50,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231025: 15,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231011: 80,000.0 (Paid)\n\nSum all paid purchases:\n\n160,000 + 50,000 + 100,000 + 250,000 + 350,000 + 80,000 + 90,000 + 120,000 + 100,000 + 200,000 + 60,000 + 25,000 + 25,000 + 400,000 + 60,000 + 100,000 + 350,000 + 45,000 + 50,000 + 15,000 + 80,000  \n= Let's calculate stepwise:\n\n- 160,000 + 50,000 = 210,000\n- 210,000 +100,000 = 310,000\n- 310,000 + 250,000 = 560,000\n- 560,000 + 350,000 = 910,000\n- 910,000 + 80,000 = 990,000\n- 990,000 + 90,000 = 1,080,000\n- 1,080,000 + 120,000 = 1,200,000\n- 1,200,000 + 100,000 = 1,300,000\n- 1,300,000 + 200,000 = 1,500,000\n- 1,500,000 + 60,000 = 1,560,000\n- 1,560,000 + 25,000 = 1,585,000\n- 1,585,000 + 25,000 = 1,610,000\n- 1,610,000 + 400,000 = 2,010,000\n- 2,010,000 + 60,000 = 2,070,000\n- 2,070,000 + 100,000 = 2,170,000\n- 2,170,000 + 350,000 = 2,520,000\n- 2,520,000 + 45,000 = 2,565,000\n- 2,565,000 + 50,000 = 2,615,000\n- 2,615,000 + 15,000 = 2,630,000\n- 2,630,000 + 80,000 = 2,710,000\n\nStep 4: Calculate net accounts payable change\n\nIncrease in accounts payable = Unpaid purchases = 450,000  \nDecrease in accounts payable = Paid purchases = 2,710,000  \n\nNet change in accounts payable = Unpaid - Paid = 450,000 - 2,710,000 = -2,260,000 (a decrease)\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n**Accounts Payable decreased by 2,260,000.00**\n\nFinal answer formatted:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"-2260000.00\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n# Final output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"-2260000.00\"}}\n```",
