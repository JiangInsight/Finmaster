A negative value here means that accounts receivable increased (cash outflow), and a positive value would indicate a decrease (cash inflow).\n\nThe question asks for the specific line item and the value of decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit. The relevant line and value is:\n\n- Line item: (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\n- Value: -1851327.29\n\nSince the value is negative, it means there's an increase in amounts owed, not a decrease. However, the task simply requires extracting the specific line item and value.\n\nTherefore, the extracted value is '-1851327.29'.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-1851327.29\"}}\n```",
