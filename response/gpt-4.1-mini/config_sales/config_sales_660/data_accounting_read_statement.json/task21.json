The task is to identify and extract the specific line item and value of income arising from the entity's core operating activities.\n2. In an income statement, income from core operating activities usually corresponds to \"Main Business Revenue\" or similarly named items related to the main operations.\n3. The problem shows two income-related line items:\n   - Main Business Revenue: 5064939.23\n   - Total Revenue: 5064939.23\n4. Since \"Main Business Revenue\" is specifically the income from core operating activities, this is what we should extract.\n\nThus, the correct value to report is the amount in \"Main Business Revenue\": 5064939.23.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"5064939.23\"}}\n```",
