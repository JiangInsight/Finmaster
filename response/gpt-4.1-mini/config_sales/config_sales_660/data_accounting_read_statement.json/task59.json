Identify the amount of interest accrued but not yet received from the financial statements.  \n   - This corresponds to the line item \"Interest Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet.\n   - The end amount of Interest Receivable is **8967.44**.\n\n2. Identify the net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period.  \n   - This corresponds to the \"Net Increase\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section in the Cash Flow Statement.\n   - The net increase is **-593035.27** (a decrease in this case).\n\nNo need to consider Income Statement for these particular values as the instruction states to output grouped by financial statement if multiple outputs; here both values come from different statements, so provide both accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the extracted values are:\n\n- Value1 (Interest Receivable end amount from Balance Sheet): 8967.44  \n- Value2 (Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents from Cash Flow Statement): -593035.27\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"8967.44\", \"value2\": \"-593035.27\"}}\n```",
