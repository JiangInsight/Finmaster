Here, \"Total Revenue\" is 5064939.23.\n\nStep 2: Identify its constituent line items.  \n- The constituent line item under \"Total Revenue\" is \"Main Business Revenue\", which is also 5064939.23.\n\nStep 3: Decompose this total income into 1 component sub-item originating from the input statement.  \n- The single sub-item here is \"Main Business Revenue\" with a value of 5064939.23.\n\nStep 4: For the sub-item, output initial and final values. Since only one date is given, initial and final values are the same (5064939.23).\n\nFinal output:  \n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"5064939.23\", \"Main Business Revenue_sub_item value\": \"5064939.23\"}}\n```",
