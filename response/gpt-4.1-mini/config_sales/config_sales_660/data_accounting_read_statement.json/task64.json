For clarity:\n\n- value1 = Capital contributed by shareholders (Paid-in Capital) from Balance Sheet  \n- value2 = Profit Before Tax from Income Statement  \n- value3 = Addition in amount owed (Accounts Payable increase) from Balance Sheet or Cash Flow Statement  \n\nSince both the Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement show the same increase for Accounts Payable (1240000.00), we can take value3 = 1240000.00.\n\n**Final JSON output:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"13000000.00\", \"value2\": \"960446.16\", \"value3\": \"1240000.00\"}}\n```",
