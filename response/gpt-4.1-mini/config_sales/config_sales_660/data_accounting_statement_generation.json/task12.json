But previously we missed the 15000 from Purchase20231231024.\n\nBut I see one error: summed just ten items, but there are 11 items.\n\nLet's list and sum carefully:\n\n1) 140,000  \n2) 40,000  \n3) 50,000  \n4) 100,000  \n5) 200,000  \n6) 60,000  \n7) 60,000  \n8) 160,000  \n9) 45,000  \n10) 300,000  \n11) 15,000  \n\nNow sum:\n\n- 140,000 + 40,000 = 180,000  \n- +50,000 = 230,000  \n- +100,000 = 330,000  \n- +200,000 = 530,000  \n- +60,000 = 590,000  \n- +60,000 = 650,000  \n- +160,000 = 810,000  \n- +45,000 = 855,000  \n- +300,000 = 1,155,000  \n- +15,000 = 1,170,000  \n\nCheck: There is still one purchase missing from above not yet added in that sum?\n\nNo, all 11 items summed.\n\nThe total unpaid account payable at end is 1,170,000.\n\nBut wait, we missed Purchase20231231017 (70000), which is Unpaid Account Payable? Check that:\n\nPurchase20231231017 | Purchase | 70000.0 | Unpaid | Account Payable | S005 | Supplier 5\n\nYes, it's Unpaid Account Payable, amount 70,000.\n\nAdd 70,000 to total:\n\n1,170,000 + 70,000 = 1,240,000\n\nAny other purchases with Unpaid Account Payable?\n\nAlso Purchase20231231024 was added (15,000).\n\nAlso Purchase20231231021 (15000) Paid - so ignore.\n\nPurchase20231231010 is Paid - ignore.\n\nPurchase20231231016 is Paid - no.\n\nPurchase20231231019 (90000) Paid - no.\n\nPurchase20231231013 (35000) Paid - no.\n\nPurchase20231231018 (40000) Paid - no.\n\nPurchase20231231025 (160000) Paid - no.\n\nPurchase20231231026 (50000) Paid - no.\n\nPurchase20231231015 (35000) Paid - no.\n\nPurchase20231231008 (90000) Paid - no.\n\nPurchase20231231002 (20000) Paid - no.\n\nPurchase20231231030 does not exist.\n\nPurchase20231231009 (450000) Paid - no.\n\nPurchase20231231005 (300000) Paid - no.\n\nPurchase20231231006 (200000) Paid - no.\n\nPurchase20231231001 counted.\n\nSo the total unpaid accounts payable sum to 1,240,000.\n\nAny other \"Unpaid\" with \"Account Payable\" that we missed?\n\n- Purchase20231231021 is Paid (15000), so no.\n\n- Purchase20231231019 (90000) Paid.\n\n- Purchase20231231022 (160000) Unpaid Account Payable (already counted).\n\n- Purchase20231231023 (45000) Unpaid Account Payable (counted).\n\n- Purchase20231231007 (100000) Unpaid Account Payable (counted).\n\n- Purchase20231231011 (200000) Unpaid Account Payable (counted).\n\n- Purchase20231231012 (60000) Unpaid Account Payable (counted).\n\n- Purchase20231231014 (60000) Unpaid Account Payable (counted).\n\n- Purchase20231231017 (70000) Unpaid Account Payable (counted).\n\n- Purchase20231231020 (300000) Unpaid Account Payable (counted).\n\n- Purchase20231231004 (50000) Unpaid Account Payable (counted).\n\n- Purchase20231231003 (40000) Unpaid Account Payable (counted).\n\n- Purchase20231231024 (15000) Unpaid Account Payable (counted).\n\nSo all counted.\n\n**Step 4: Check if initial accounts payable is zero**\n\nThere is no initial account payable initial balance explicitly stated if \"Initial\" entries for accounts payable exist.\n\nThe initial entries are for Cash Deposit, Bank Deposit, Fixed Assets only.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Accounts Payable Initial Value = 0.00\n\n- Accounts Payable End Value = sum of all unpaid \"Account Payable\" purchases = 1,240,000.00\n\n**Final output:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"1240000.00\"}}\n```\n\n# Reasoning:\n\n- Initial balance of accounts payable is zero.\n\n- After purchases and payments, the remaining unpaid purchases with payment method \"Account Payable\" totaled 1,240,000.00.\n\n# Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"1240000.00\"}}\n```",
