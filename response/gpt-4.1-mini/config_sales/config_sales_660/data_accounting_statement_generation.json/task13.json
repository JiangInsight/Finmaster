Identify the initial taxes payable amount as of the starting date (2023-12-31), which is typically derived from initial transactions or balance data.\n2. Calculate the taxes payable at the end date (latest date in data), by:\n   - Summing the taxes related to sales transactions (tax_amount).\n   - Subtract taxes related to purchases or any adjustments if provided.\n   - Consider if any taxes are prepaid or are part of expenses that reduce payable.\n   \nFrom the problem data, note the following:\n\n- Initial records:\n  - There is no explicit taxes payable amount recorded for 2023-12-31 in the initial data.\n\n- Sales transactions have tax_amount recorded (tax collected from customers, liability to pay).\n\n- Purchases do not have tax_amount explicitly listed; no tax credit details given.\n\n- Expenses do not have tax_amount.\n\n- Hence, likely the taxes payable equals the sum of sales tax collected minus any tax payed or adjustments.\n\nStep 1: Initial Taxes Payable\n\n- The initial records on 2023-12-31 show Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets, and some Purchase transactions. But none include tax_amount.\n- So initial taxes payable = 0.00.\n\nStep 2: Calculate Taxes Payable End Value\n\n- Aggregate total tax_amount from all sales transactions (type == \"Sale\").\n- Subtract any taxes paid, if any (not shown explicitly paying taxes separately).\n- Since no tax paid transaction is observed separately, we will just sum tax_amount from sales as taxes payable.\n  \nLet's sum tax_amount from all sales records:\n\nSales tax_amount values found (only sales type and tax_amount field):\n\n- 2024-01-02: 5271.39 + 3653.32 = 8924.71\n- 2024-01-03: 495.96 + 1937.95 + 1987.52 + 1949.85 = 6371.28\n- 2024-01-04: 3522.82 + 1842.86 = 5365.68\n- 2024-01-05: 3546.3 + 8744.18 + 1839.57 = 14130.05\n- 2024-01-06: 2765.95 + 2592.68 = 5358.63\n- 2024-01-07: 2714.75 + 983.53 + 1915.36 = 5613.64\n- 2024-01-08: 13569.1 + 1887.68 + 1886.87 + 992.74 = 18336.39\n- 2024-01-09: 466.83 = 466.83\n- 2024-01-10: 2995.7 + 872.42 + 5259.15 = 9127.27\n- 2024-01-11: 4418.7 = 4418.7\n- 2024-01-12: 8921.84 + 974.41 + 5294.57 + 1908.2 = 17099.02\n- 2024-01-13: 1386.83 + 984.86 + 1809.79 = 4181.48\n- 2024-01-14: 3502.99 = 3502.99\n- 2024-01-15: 1414.77 + 1291.67 + 5684.31 = 8390.75\n- 2024-01-16: 2563.74 + 1717.46 = 4281.2\n- 2024-01-17: 9567.89 + 875.27 = 10443.16\n- 2024-01-18: 958.51 + 9818.01 = 10776.52\n- 2024-01-19: 2615.78 + 2869.2 = 5484.98\n- 2024-01-20: 894.9 + 1714.81 = 2609.71\n- 2024-01-21: 1821.06 + 13871.07 + 1280.92 + 2866.87 = 19839.92\n- 2024-01-22: 9977.03 + 993.01 + 4784.53 = 15754.57\n- 2024-01-23: 972.04 + 994.92 + 3810.53 = 5777.49\n- 2024-01-24: 858.61 + 1494.39 = 2353.00\n- 2024-01-25: 13429.76 = 13429.76\n- 2024-01-26: 989.05 + 932.32 = 1921.37\n- 2024-01-27: 3719.35 + 3800.08 + 5260.85 = 12780.28\n- 2024-01-28: 1950.22 + 2969.78 + 888.14 + 9992.23 = 15700.37\n- 2024-01-29: 981.04 + 1751.03 + 13976.16 = 16608.23\n- 2024-01-30: 6413.96 + 3715.01 = 10128.97\n\nSum all these tax_amount sums:\n\nCalculate:\n\n8924.71 \n+ 6371.28 \n+ 5365.68 \n+ 14130.05 \n+ 5358.63 \n+ 5613.64 \n+ 18336.39 \n+ 466.83 \n+ 9127.27 \n+ 4418.7 \n+ 17099.02 \n+ 4181.48 \n+ 3502.99 \n+ 8390.75 \n+ 4281.2 \n+ 10443.16 \n+ 10776.52 \n+ 5484.98 \n+ 2609.71 \n+ 19839.92 \n+ 15754.57 \n+ 5777.49 \n+ 2353.00 \n+ 13429.76 \n+ 1921.37 \n+ 12780.28 \n+ 15700.37 \n+ 16608.23 \n+ 10128.97 \n\nWe'll sum:\n\nStep-by-step sum:\n\n8924.71 + 6371.28 = 15295.99  \n15295.99 + 5365.68 = 20661.67  \n20661.67 + 14130.05 = 34791.72  \n34791.72 + 5358.63 = 40150.35  \n40150.35 + 5613.64 = 45763.99  \n45763.99 + 18336.39 = 64099.38  \n64099.38 + 466.83 = 64566.21  \n64566.21 + 9127.27 = 73693.48  \n73693.48 + 4418.7 = 78112.18  \n78112.18 + 17099.02 = 95211.2  \n95211.2 + 4181.48 = 99392.68  \n99392.68 + 3502.99 = 102895.67  \n102895.67 + 8390.75 = 111286.42  \n111286.42 + 4281.2 = 115567.62  \n115567.62 + 10443.16 = 126010.78  \n126010.78 + 10776.52 = 136787.3  \n136787.3 + 5484.98 = 142272.28  \n142272.28 + 2609.71 = 144882.0  \n144882.0 + 19839.92 = 164721.92  \n164721.92 + 15754.57 = 180476.49  \n180476.49 + 5777.49 = 186253.98  \n186253.98 + 2353.00 = 188606.98  \n188606.98 + 13429.76 = 202036.74  \n202036.74 + 1921.37 = 203958.11  \n203958.11 + 12780.28 = 216738.39  \n216738.39 + 15700.37 = 232438.76  \n232438.76 + 16608.23 = 249046.99  \n249046.99 + 10128.97 = 259175.96  \n\nSo total tax_amount from sales = 259,175.96\n\nThere may be additional tax generated from \"Sale\" records near 2023-12-31 (if any), but as per given data, initial values are zero.\n\nNo tax credits from purchases shown explicitly.\n\nHence taxes payable at end date is approximately 259,175.96\n\n**However**, from the example solution for similar data, the answer includes two digits after decimal and total about 271,550.92 which is about 12k higher than this summation, possibly because the example data is different and may include other tax components.\n\nIn this problem, proceed with the sum of tax_amount from sales only.\n\nThus:\n\n- Taxes Payable Initial Value = 0.00\n- Taxes Payable End Value = 259,175.96 (rounded to 2 decimals)\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"259175.96\"}}\n```\n",
