Purchase20231231001: 140,000.0 (Unpaid)  \n2. Purchase20231231003: 40,000.0 (Unpaid)  \n3. Purchase20231231004: 50,000.0 (Unpaid)  \n4. Purchase20231231007: 100,000.0 (Unpaid)  \n5. Purchase20231231010: 60,000.0 (Unpaid)  \n6. Purchase20231231012: 60,000.0 (Unpaid)  \n7. Purchase20231231014: 60,000.0 (Unpaid)  \n8. Purchase20231231022: 160,000.0 (Unpaid)  \n9.

Purchase20231231007 (again?) 100,000 (already counted?) - Appeared once, the previous one matched.\n\nWe need to be careful not to double count.\n\nChecking carefully:\n\n- Purchase20231231007 - Unpaid 100,000.0 (S003)  \n- Purchase20231231011 - Unpaid 200,000.0 (S007)  \n- Purchase20231231022 - Unpaid 160,000.0 (S001)  \n- Purchase20231231023 - Unpaid 45,000.0 (S004)  \n- Purchase20231231024 - Unpaid 15,000.0 (S003)  \n\nSum of unpaid purchases as of 2023-12-31 is (only counting 2023-12-31 date entries with \"Unpaid\"):\n\n- 140,000.0 (Purchase20231231001)  \n- 40,000.0  (Purchase20231231003)  \n- 50,000.0  (Purchase20231231004)  \n- 100,000.0 (Purchase20231231007)  \n- 60,000.0  (Purchase20231231010)  \n- 60,000.0  (Purchase20231231012)  \n- 60,000.0  (Purchase20231231014)  \n- 160,000.0 (Purchase20231231022)  \n- 45,000.0  (Purchase20231231023)  \n- 300,000.0 (Purchase20231231020)  \n- 15,000.0  (Purchase20231231024)  \n- 200,000.0 (Purchase20231231011)  \n\nSum = 140000 + 40000 + 50000 + 100000 + 60000 + 60000 + 60000 + 160000 + 45000 + 300000 + 15000 + 200000  \n= \n\n140,000  \n+ 40,000 = 180,000  \n+ 50,000 = 230,000  \n+ 100,000 = 330,000  \n+ 60,000 = 390,000  \n+ 60,000 = 450,000  \n+ 60,000 = 510,000  \n+ 160,000 = 670,000  \n+ 45,000 = 715,000  \n+ 300,000 = 1,015,000  \n+ 15,000 = 1,030,000  \n+ 200,000 = 1,230,000  \n\nSo initial accounts payable balance is approximately 1,230,000.\n\n**Step 3: Find ending accounts payable balance**\n\nAssuming we are checking all purchases marked as unpaid at the end of the period. Since the data ends roughly on 2024-01-29 or 2024-01-30, and all purchases have recorded_date 2023-12-31, all unpaid purchases remain unpaid (there is no evidence of payments reducing unpaid accounts payable except the status marked \"Paid\").\n\nBut we should check if any purchases originally unpaid have become paid:\n\nLook for \"Purchase\" entries with status \"Paid\" after 2023-12-31:\n\n- Purchase20231231002: Paid 20,000.0 (on 2023-12-31)  \n- Purchase20231231005: Paid 300,000.0 (on 2023-12-31)  \n- Purchase20231231006: Paid 200,000.0 (on 2023-12-31)  \n- Purchase20231231008: Paid 90,000.0 (2023-12-31)  \n- Purchase20231231009: Paid 45,000.0 (2023-12-31)  \n- Purchase20231231015: Paid 35,000.0 (2023-12-31)  \n- Purchase20231231016: Paid 400,000.0 (2023-12-31)  \n- Purchase20231231026: Paid 50,000.0 (2023-12-31)  \n- Purchase20231231025: Paid 160,000.0 (2023-12-31)  \n- Purchase20231231019: Paid 40,000.0 (2023-12-31)  \n- Purchase20231231021: Paid 15,000.0 (2023-12-31)  \n\nThese are purchases that have been paid already (so not contributing to ending accounts payable).\n\n**Now check for any unpaid purchases after 2023-12-31 (with date > 2023-12-31)**\n- No purchase entries with date beyond 2023-12-31 are present.\n\nThus, ending accounts payable balance is sum of unpaid purchase amounts as above = 1,230,000.\n\n**Step 4: Look for any payments of these unpaid accounts (to decrease)**\n\nCheck payments status on unpaid purchases with \"Paid\" status after 2023-12-31:\n\n- From data, some unpaid purchases are still unpaid (e.g., Purchase20231231001: Unpaid 140,000.0 still unpaid)\n\n- Some purchases originally unpaid become paid? No evidence in data.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude accounts payable change**\n\n- Initial accounts payable balance (Opening) = 1,230,000  \n- Ending accounts payable balance (Closing) = Sum of unpaid purchases (still unpaid) = 1,230,000  \n\nNo indication that unpaid accounts decreased or paid status changed for unordered purchases after initial date, so no change observed in accounts payable balance from purchases.\n\nHowever, in the example solution, \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is based on the difference between the total unpaid purchases and the total paid purchases, or sum of unpaid minus sum of paid related to accounts payable.\n\n**Alternatively, since we have initial data for purchases \"paid\" and \"unpaid\", maybe what is asked is the net change in accounts payable from the initial date to after processing all purchase payments in the period.**\n\nCheck the total of new purchases on credit (unpaid) in the current period? No new purchases after 2023-12-31. So no increase in accounts payable.\n\nCheck if some of initial unpaid purchases have been paid off in the current period (reducing accounts payable).\n\nWe can see purchases with status \"Paid\" and payment_method is Bank Transfer or Cash for purchases.\n\n- Paid purchases values: sum all purchases marked \"Paid\".\n\nPurchases marked \"Paid\":\n\n- Purchase20231231002: 20,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231005: 300,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231006: 200,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231008: 90,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231009: 45,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231015: 35,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231016: 400,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231026: 50,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231025: 160,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231019: 40,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231021: 15,000.0  \n\nSum:\n\n20,000 + 300,000 = 320,000  \n+ 200,000 = 520,000  \n+ 90,000 = 610,000  \n+ 45,000 = 655,000  \n+ 35,000 = 690,000  \n+ 400,000 = 1,090,000  \n+ 50,000 = 1,140,000  \n+ 160,000 = 1,300,000  \n+ 40,000 = 1,340,000  \n+ 15,000 = 1,355,000  \n\nThis sum 1,355,000 is for paid purchases, presumably paid off accounts payable.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate net change in accounts payable**\n\nIf initial accounts payable was 1,230,000, and the company paid off 1,355,000 in purchases, to have paid more than initial unpaid does not seem possible unless purchases were also made on credit during the period increasing accounts payable.\n\nBut from data, no purchases after 2023-12-31.\n\n**Hence, this suggests the question expects the net change in accounts payable = sum of unpaid purchases - sum of paid purchases related to accounts payable during the period.**\n\nSince initial accounts payable is not explicitly stated, the net change = total unpaid purchases (account payable) - total paid purchases (account payable)\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nUnpaid purchases (accounts payable) sum to 1,230,000 (unpaid purchase amounts)  \nPaid purchases (purchase with status \"Paid\") sum to 1,355,000  \n\nNet change in accounts payable = Unpaid purchases - Paid purchases = 1,230,000 - 1,355,000 = -125,000 (decrease)\n\nBut negative change means accounts payable decreased by 125,000.\n\n**Step 7: Output result**\n\nFormat the result as per instruction:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '-125000.00'} }\n```\n\n---\n\n# Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"-125000.00\"}}\n```",
