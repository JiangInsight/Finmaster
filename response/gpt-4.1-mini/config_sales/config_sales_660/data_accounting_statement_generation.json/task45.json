                        "content": "To calculate the net cash flow from investing activities, we need to identify cash flows related to investing activities from the transactions. In typical cash flow statements, investing activities include:\n\n- Purchases of fixed assets or long-term assets (cash outflows)\n- Sales or disposals of fixed assets or long-term assets (cash inflows)\n- Other investing activities such as loans made/collected or securities bought/sold (not seen here)\n\nFrom the data provided, key investing transactions are those with `type` related to fixed assets purchases.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify Investing Activities Transactions\n\nLook for rows that indicate fixed assets purchase with a **paid** status and payment method involving cash or bank transfer (indicating actual cash flow).\n\nFrom the data snippet, the types related to investing activities are like:\n\n- FixedAsset20231231001 with asset purchases\n- Fixed Assets Purchase type\n- Purchase with asset_name and asset_type may also be considered, but looking at dataset, asset purchases are mainly under \"FixedAsset20231231001\" and similar lines.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Extract Fixed Assets Purchases with Paid Status\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- FixedAsset20231231001 entries with Paid status and amounts:\n\n  - 73907.19 (date 2023-12-31) - Storage Facilities (S009) - Paid - Bank Transfer  \n  - 171448.09 (2023-12-31) - Storage Facilities (S005) - Paid - Bank Transfer  \n  - 92277.65 (2023-12-31) - Production Line6 (S010) - Paid - Bank Transfer  \n  - 191303.24 (2023-12-31) - Production Line7 (S005) - Paid - Bank Transfer  \n  - 73907.19 (2023-12-31) - \"Production Line4\" (S009) – from problem description (check carefully)  \n  - 171448.09 (2023-12-31) - \"Storage Facilities5\" (S010)  \n  - 92277.65 (2023-12-31) - \"Production Line6\" (S010)  \n  - 191303.24 (2023-12-31) - \"Production Line7\" (S005)\n\nNote: Some appear duplicated in given data, but here in the problem, the exact values are:\n\n- 73907.19\n- 171448.09\n- 92277.65\n- 191303.24\n\nAdding these four amounts from FixedAsset purchases:\n\n73907.19 + 171448.09 + 92277.65 + 191303.24 = ?\n\nCalculate:\n\n73907.19  \n+171448.09 = 245355.28  \n+92277.65 = 337632.93  \n+191303.24 = 528936.17\n\nNo sales of fixed assets are listed, so no inflows from investing activities.\n\nThere are also some large purchases labeled as \"Purchase\" but these seem related to inventory (products), not capital assets.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Confirm No Investing Activity Inflows\n\nNo sales or disposals of fixed assets are noted in the data — no entries indicating inflows from sale of assets.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Therefore\n\nNet cash flow from investing activities = Cash inflows from sale of assets - Cash outflows for purchase of assets\n\n= 0 - 528,936.17\n\n= -528,936.17\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-528936.17\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n# Summary:\n\n- Only investing cash flow is capital asset purchases\n- Total cash outflows for Fixed Assets: 528,936.17\n- No investing cash inflows\n- Net cash flow from investing activities = -528,936.17",
