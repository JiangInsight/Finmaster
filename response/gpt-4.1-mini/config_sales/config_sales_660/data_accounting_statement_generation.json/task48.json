related to cash and cash equivalents.**\n\n- Cash inflows: cash received from sales or other activities paid in cash.\n- Cash outflows: cash paid for expenses, purchases, fixed assets, etc. in cash.\n- Transfers between cash and bank accounts are not a net change because one decreases cash while the other increases bank deposits (both are cash equivalents), so these transfers net to zero in cash and cash equivalents overall.\n\n**Step 2: Summarize initial cash and bank deposits (opening balances).**\n\n- Initial Cash Deposit: 3,000,000.0\n- Initial Bank Deposit: 5,000,000.0\n\nInitial Total Cash and Cash Equivalents = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000\n\n**Step 3: Sum all cash inflows (only those marked \"Cash\" in payment_method and \"Paid\" in payment/receipt_status for sales and
