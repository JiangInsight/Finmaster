difference is because in example the interest amounts were smaller.\n\nHowever, the problem requires initial and ending interest receivable amounts only based on initial and final dates.\n\nNow, we must confirm initial Interest Receivable at 2023-12-31 is zero (no interest receivable before that).\n\nEnding Interest Receivable is the sum of all \"Interest Receivables\" amounts that are unpaid from the start up to the last date 2024-01-29 (including all from 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-29).\n\nThus, final interest receivable = sum of all unpaid interest receivables amounts from 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-29.\n\nSum of amounts (from amounts in the problem):\n\nLet's extract and sum the exact amounts from the problem:\n\nFrom the \"Interest Receivables\" rows (unpaid):\n\n- 2024-01-01: 445.0  \n- 2024-01-02: 443.22  \n- 2024-01-03: 398.72  \n- 2024-01-04: 392.14  \n- 2024-01-05: 384.13  \n- 2024-01-06: 344.08  \n- 2024-01-07: 323.48  \n- 2024-01-08: 323.48  \n- 2024-01-09: 323.48  \n- 2024-01-10: 323.48  \n- 2024-01-11: 323.48  \n- 2024-01-12: 323.48  \n- 2024-01-13: 323.48  \n- 2024-01-14: 323.48  \n- 2024-01-15: 312.16  \n- 2024-01-16: 295.13  \n- 2024-01-17: 259.53  \n- 2024-01-18: 259.53  \n- 2024-01-19: 259.53  \n- 2024-01-20: 259.53  \n- 2024-01-21: 259.53  \n- 2024-01-22: 259.53  \n- 2024-01-23: 259.53  \n- 2024-01-24: 259.53  \n- 2024-01-25: 259.53  \n- 2024-01-26: 259.53  \n- 2024-01-27: 259.53  \n- 2024-01-28: 255.08  \n- 2024-01-29: 255.08  \n\nPerforming the sum:\n\nThis is a sum of:\n\n- 445.0 + 443.22 + 398.72 + 392.14 + 384.13 + 344.08 = sum_first_6  \nsum_first_6 = 445.0 + 443.22 = 888.22  \n888.22 + 398.72 = 1286.94  \n1286.94 + 392.14 = 1679.08  \n1679.08 + 384.13 = 2063.21  \n2063.21 + 344.08 = 2407.29  \n\n- Next 8 entries = 8*323.48 = 2587.84\n\n  Dates 2024-01-07 to 2024-01-14: 8 days x 323.48\n\nSum till 2024-01-14 = 2407.29 + 2587.84 = 4995.13\n\n- 2024-01-15: 312.16 -> 4995.13 + 312.16 = 5307.29  \n- 2024-01-16: 295.13 -> 5307.29 + 295.13 = 5602.42  \n- Next 13 days (2024-01-17 to 2024-01-29 except two last days) with amount 259.53 each:\n\nWe have:\n\nDates: 2024-01-17 to 2024-01-27 = 11 days x 259.53 = 2854.83  \nSum = 5602.42 + 2854.83 = 8457.25  \n\n- 2024-01-28: 255.08 -> 8457.25 + 255.08 = 8712.33  \n- 2024-01-29: 255.08 -> 8712.33 + 255.08 = 8967.41  \n\nSo total Interest Receivable End Value = 8967.41 approximately.\n\nStep 3: Format results as string with two decimals.\n\nInitial = 0.00  \nEnd = 8967.41\n\nAnswer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"8967.41\"}}\n```\n\n# Final output: \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"8967.41\"}}\n```}",
