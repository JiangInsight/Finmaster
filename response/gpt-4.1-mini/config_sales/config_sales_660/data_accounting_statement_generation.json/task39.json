Since no entries on 2023-12-31 for interest receivable, initial balance is 0.\n\nStep 5: The difference = Ending Balance - Beginning Balance = Change in Interest Receivable\n\n---\n\n**Now, calculate actual figures from data given:**\n\nExtract interest receivable entries with unpaid status and sum their recorded_amount:\n\nListing out the amounts (recorded_amount) for all rows with \"Interest Receivables\" type and \"Unpaid\" status (payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\"):\n\nDates and amounts:\n\n- 2024-01-01: 445.0  \n- 2024-01-02: 443.22 (approx)  \n- 2024-01-03: 398.72  \n- 2024-01-04: 392.14226009  \n- 2024-01-05: 384.13226009  \n- 2024-01-06: 344.08226009  \n- 2024-01-07: 323.48338008  \n- 2024-01-08: 323.48338008  \n- 2024-01-09: 323.48338008  \n- 2024-01-10: 323.48338008  \n- 2024-01-11: 323.48338008  \n- 2024-01-12: 323.48338008  \n- 2024-01-13: 323.48338008  \n- 2024-01-14: 323.48338008  \n- 2024-01-15: 312.15566923  \n- 2024-01-16: 295.12968087  \n- 2024-01-17: 259.52968087  \n- 2024-01-18: 259.52968087  \n- 2024-01-19: 259.52968087  \n- 2024-01-20: 259.52968087  \n- 2024-01-21: 259.52968087  \n- 2024-01-22: 259.52968087  \n- 2024-01-23: 259.52968087  \n- 2024-01-24: 259.52968087  \n- 2024-01-25: 259.52968087  \n- 2024-01-26: 259.52968087  \n- 2024-01-27: 259.52968087  \n- 2024-01-28: 255.07968087  \n- 2024-01-29: 255.07968087  \n\nWe should also confirm if there are any negative amounts or discrepancies:\n\nChecking negative amounts: None with negative values in the problem data.\n\n---\n\nSum all these unpaid interest receivable amounts for end balance:\n\nSum = 445.0 + 443.22 + 398.72 + 392.14226009 + 384.13226009 + 344.08226009 + 323.48338008 + 323.48338008 + 323.48338008 + 323.48338008 + 323.48338008 + 323.48338008 + 323.48338008 + 323.48338008 + 312.15566923 + 295.12968087 + 259.52968087 + 259.52968087 + 259.52968087 + 259.52968087 + 259.52968087 + 259.52968087 + 259.52968087 + 259.52968087 + 259.52968087 + 259.52968087 + 259.52968087 + 259.52968087 + 255.07968087 + 255.07968087\n\nCalculating:\n\nFirst, group the 323.48338008 repeated 9 times:\n\n323.48338008 * 9 = 2911.35042072\n\nSum rest stepwise:\n\n- 445.0 + 443.22 = 888.22  \n- +398.72 = 1286.94  \n- +392.14226009 = 1679.08  \n- +384.13226009 = 2063.21  \n- +344.08226009 = 2407.29  \n- +2911.35042072 (sum of 9x 323.48338008) = 5318.64  \n- +312.15566923 = 5630.79  \n- +295.12968087 = 5925.92  \n- Now add the 259.52968087 repeated 12 times: 259.52968087 * 12 = 3114.36  \n- 5925.92 + 3114.36 = 9039.80  \n- +255.07968087 (twice) = 255.07968087 * 2 = 510.16  \n- 9039.80 + 510.16 = 9549.96\n\nSo total unpaid interest receivable balance at end is approximately 9549.96\n\n---\n\nStep 6: Initial interest receivable balance (2023-12-31):\n\nNone noted; Assume 0.\n\n---\n\nStep 7: Calculate change in interest receivable = End balance - Beginning balance = 9549.96 - 0 = 9549.96\n\n---\n\nStep 8: Finally, the change in interest receivable (an increase) will be recorded in the cash flow statement as an increase in interest receivable (cash outflow adjustment?).\n\nThe solution expects the value as a negative for Increase in interest receivable (because it means cash has not been received):\n\nHence:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-9549.96\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n# Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-9549.96\"}}\n```",
