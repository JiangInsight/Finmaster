The transaction Purchase20231231001 shows recorded_preparer as \"Staff\" but the description says prepared by \"Supervisor\". The original preparer should be \"Supervisor\" as per description.\n2. recorded_amount is 140000.0 which is consistent with quantity 7.0 and unit price 20000.0.\n3. recorded_approver is \"Director\" consistently in both places.\n4. No other inconsistencies found in this transaction.\n5. Other fields match between recorded and original data.\n\nNo other transactions show internal inconsistencies based on the data provided and standardized invoice data.",
