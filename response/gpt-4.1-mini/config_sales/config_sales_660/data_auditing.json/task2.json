Hence, no corrections needed.\n\nAll other transactions show consistent values or reflect no contradictory info based on provided data. The only inconsistency noted in the original dataset was an invoice with mismatched recorded date and original date for an expense (Expense20240129001), but that is not repeated here.\n\nTherefore, only the above transaction was analyzed and found consistent.",
