However:\n  - Recorded quantity is 9.0, unit price $20,000, total amount $180,000, which is consistent.\n  - Supplier ID is S008 and Supplier name is Supplier 8, which is new compared to previous examples but no error inferred.\n  - Recorded preparer is empty/None but narrative says it was prepared by Staff.\n- Thus, the only inconsistency identified is the missing recorded preparer field (Recorded Preparer is None vs Original Preparer Staff).\n- No other fields are inconsistent based on provided data and reasonable assumptions.",
