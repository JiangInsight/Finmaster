Usually, IDs should be uniqueâ€”however, no internal inconsistency is stated in their fields for this task.\n\n- In the presented problem row with id `Purchase20231231001`:\n  - Recorded quantity is 9.0\n  - Recorded unit price is 20000.0\n  - Recorded total amount is 180000.0\n  - Calculation 9.0 * 20000.0 = 180000.0 matches total amount.\n  - Payment method, status, approver, preparer, supplier ID, and name are consistent with the invoice statement.\n  \n- Thus, no inconsistency is observed for this transaction.\n\n- The other transactions contain no contradictions between fields based on the reliable invoice information.\n\n- There are no other conflicting fields detected for this transaction row based on the provided data.",
