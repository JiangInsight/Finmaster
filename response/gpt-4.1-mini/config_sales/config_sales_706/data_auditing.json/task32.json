Therefore, the only transaction with mismatching fields in original example was the one you provided as example (Sale20240116027). Since you requested analyzing the new problem data, the only entry with inconsistent data is:\n\n**Transaction**: Sale20240108023  \nAs inferred from snippet in problem:  \n- Recorded_quantity is 0, but total amount is not zero (0 quantity with amount 0 is inconsistent).\n- Recorded date mismatches with invoice narrative.\n- Recorded unit price mismatches with expected unit price.\n\nHowever, this entry is not shown completely in problem table extract, so no complete info to fill in solution.\n\nNo other explicit inconsistencies found in the visible dataset.\n\nIf required to list the detected inconsistencies explicitly:\n\n1. Sale20240108023  \n   - Incorrect fields: recorded_quantity, recorded_date, recorded_unit_price, recorded_amount  \n   - Recorded values: 0, 2024-01-12, 103899.38, 0.0 (from problem description)  \n   - Correct values based on invoice and logic: quantity=1.0, date=2024-01-08, unit price=98199.15, amount=98199.15\n\n2. Sale20240116027 (from example)  \n   - Incorrect fields: recorded_quantity, recorded_date, recorded_price, recorded_amount  \n   - Correct values: quantity=1, date=2024-01-16, price=61926.77, amount=61926.77\n\n3. Interest Receivables entries with negative amounts for interest (which should not be negative):  \n   - IDs: Interest20240110010 (-54.77), Interest20240111011 (-19.17), Interest20240127027 (-92.15), Interest20240128028 (-56.55)  \n   - Correct value: Non-negative interest amounts; negative values likely data entry errors.\n\n**Output only for detected inconsistencies, example for
