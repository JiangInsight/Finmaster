So only consider Cash.  \n- Also initial cash deposits included already (step 1).\n\n**Step 4: Sum up cash outflows:**  \n- All expenses paid by Cash or Bank (here, many expenses have payment_method = Cash and payment/receipt_status = Paid). Sum these.  \n- Purchases paid by Cash or Bank reduce cash or bank.  \n- Fixed assets purchases paid by Bank reduce cash equivalents.  \n- Transfers cash to bank - transfer net zero effect as explained.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate net increase:**  \nNet Increase = Cash and Bank inflows - Cash and Bank outflows\n\n---\n\n### Now, let's calculate precisely by summing values from the
