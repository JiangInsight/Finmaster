                        "content": "To solve the problem, let's identify the three required values from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**  \n   This corresponds to **\"Profit Before Tax\"** in the Income Statement.\n\n2. **The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**  \n   This corresponds to **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable** from the Cash Flow Statement (or the ending balance of Accounts Payable in the Balance Sheet). The best match here is the change in Accounts Payable, which is listed in the Cash Flow Statement as **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**.\n\n3. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**  \n   This corresponds to **Paid-in Capital** on the Balance Sheet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Extract values from the Balance Sheet\n- **Paid-in Capital** (capital contributed by shareholders):  \n  End_amount = 13000000.00\n\n- **Accounts Payable** (the amount owed for purchases on credit):   \n  Ending balance = 1820000.00\n\nBut the problem wants the *addition* in the amount owed. To get the addition during the period, check the opening and ending balances:\n\n- Initial Accounts Payable = 0.00  \n- End Accounts Payable = 1820000.00  \nâ†’ Increase = 1820000.00\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Extract from Income Statement\n- **Profit Before Tax**: 1393861.65\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Extract from Cash Flow Statement (to double check)\n- **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: 1820000.00  \nThis confirms the above increase for accounts payable.\n\n---\n\n### Final values:\n- Balance Sheet: Paid-in Capital = **13000000.00**\n- Income Statement: Profit Before Tax = **1393861.65**\n- Cash Flow Statement: Increase in Accounts Payable = **1820000.00**\n\n---\n\n### Solution JSON:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"13000000.00\", \"value2\": \"1393861.65\", \"value3\": \"1820000.00\"}}\n```",
