In typical income statements, this corresponds to \"Main Business Revenue\" (or similar terms like \"Main Operating Revenue\").  \n  2. Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, which is represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\".  \n\n- From the income statement provided:  \n  - Main Business Revenue = 5813420.67  \n  - Cost of Goods Sold = 3175000.00  \n\nThese correspond exactly to the two values requested.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"5813420.67\", \"value2\": \"3175000.00\"} }\n```",
