This increase represents the amount of depreciation expense recognized during the period.  \n- Therefore, the relevant expense amount to extract is reflected by the change in Accumulated Depreciation.  \n\nHence, initial value of expense (Accumulated Depreciation) = 0.00  \nEnd value of expense (Accumulated Depreciation) = 45,749.76\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"45749.76\"} }\n```",
