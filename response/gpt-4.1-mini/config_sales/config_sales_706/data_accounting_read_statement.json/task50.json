The four line items to identify (with their values) are:\n   - The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life → This is typically \"Depreciation\".\n   - Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in ordinary course, in production for such sale, or in process of being manufactured → This relates to inventory changes, usually \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\".\n   - Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments (not cash equivalents) and the receipt of interest and dividends → This corresponds to \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n   - Net addition in amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period → This is \"Net Increase\".\n\n2. From the input table:\n\n| Account                                          | Amount     |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Depreciation                                    | 45749.76   |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory                | -295000.00 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities         | -352857.55 |\n| Net Increase                                    | 1245580.45 |\n\n3. So the values are:\n\n- value1 = '45749.76'\n- value2 = '-295000.00'\n- value3 = '-352857.55'\n- value4 = '1245580.45'\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"45749.76\", \"value2\": \"-295000.00\", \"value3\": \"-352857.55\", \"value4\": \"1245580.45\"}}\n```",
