Selling expenses relate to securing orders; COGS relates to delivering goods and services.\n\nHowever, based on the example solution, only the Selling Expenses value was extracted as \"costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services.\"\n\nBut logically, delivering goods and services is mainly represented by Cost of Goods Sold.\n\nThe example solution extracted only Selling Expenses.\n\nGiven the example focuses on Selling Expenses as the cost to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services, we follow the example.\n\nHence, answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"731171.32\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"731171.32\"}}\n```",
