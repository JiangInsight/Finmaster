Since only current liabilities are given, we'll assume Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\nFrom cash flow statement:\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 1,598,438.00\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify Total Debt (Total Liabilities)\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n\n- Total Current Liabilities = 2,110,671.05\n\nNo non-current liabilities are listed explicitly. Since only liabilities shown are current liabilities, we will use Total Current Liabilities as Total Debt.\n\nTotal Debt = 2,110,671.05\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1,598,438.00}{2,110,671.05} \\approx 0.7574\n\\]\n\nRounded to two decimal places: 0.76\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"0.76\"}}\n```",
