From balance sheet:\n\nTotal Assets = Liabilities + Equity\n\nEquity = 14,103,190.60\n\nSo, Total Liabilities = Total Assets - Equity\n\n= 16,213,861.65 - 14,103,190.60 = 2,110,671.05\n\n(Note that total liabilities = total current liabilities here because no non-current liabilities are given)\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\n= 2,110,671.05 / 16,213,861.65 ≈ 0.1302 (or 13.02%)\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n\n= 2,110,671.05 / 14,103,190.60 ≈ 0.1496 (or ~0.15)\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Liabilities\n\n= 1,598,438.00 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 0.7575\n\n---\n\n### Final Results:\n\n- Current Ratio ≈ 5.17\n\n- Quick Ratio ≈ 5.03\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio ≈ 0.13\n\n- Debt to Equity Ratio ≈ 0.15\n\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio ≈ 0.76\n\nRounded to 2 decimals.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Current Ratio\": \"5.17\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"5.03\", \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.13\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.15\", \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"0.76\"}}\n```",
