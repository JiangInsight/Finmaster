                        "content": "Step 1: Identify the required three line items:\n\n- The line item of \"capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares,\" which typically appears on the Balance Sheet and is commonly labeled as \"Paid-in Capital.\"\n- The end value of profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense, that is \"Profit Before Tax\" from the Income Statement.\n- The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period. This corresponds to the increase in \"Accounts Payable,\" which appears in the Balance Sheet or Cash Flow Statement as the change in \"Accounts Payable.\"\n\nStep 2: Extract these values from the given data:\n\n1. From Balance Sheet:  \n   - \"Paid-in Capital\" = 28000000.00 (End_amount)\n\n2. From Income Statement:  \n   - \"Profit Before Tax\" = 2858088.75\n\n3. From Balance Sheet / Cash Flow Statement:  \n   - \"Accounts Payable\" (end amount) = 0.00  \n   - In Cash flow statement: \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" = 0.00  \n   \nSince the problem asks specifically for \"the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period,\" this is the increase in Accounts Payable during the period, which is 0.00 according to both the Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement.\n\nStep 3: Present the results grouped by financial statement and in original order.\n\n- Balance Sheet line item (capital contributed by shareholders): \"Paid-in Capital\" = 28000000.00\n- Income Statement line item (profit or loss before tax): \"Profit Before Tax\" = 2858088.75\n- Balance Sheet / Cash Flow Statement line item (increase in amount owed to creditors): \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" = 0.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"28000000.00\", \"value2\": \"2858088.75\", \"value3\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
