The amount of profit an entity retains after all expenses (including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) have been deducted from total revenue. This usually corresponds to **Net Profit**.\n2. The cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets. This is usually shown as **Purchase of Fixed Assets**.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n- From the provided table:\n  - **Net Profit** = 1842166.21\n  - **Purchase of Fixed Assets** = 2670827.47\n\nThese are the two amounts that correspond to the task requirements.\n\n### Final output:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1842166.21', 'value2': '2670827.47'} }\n```",
