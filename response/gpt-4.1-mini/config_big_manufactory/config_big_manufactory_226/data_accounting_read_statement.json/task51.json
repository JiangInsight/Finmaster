Look for line items related to interest receivable or accrued interest but not yet received.\n2. From the **balance sheet**, the line item is “Interest Receivable”:\n   - Initial value: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n   - End value: 18176.52 (as of 2024-02-05)\n3. The cash flow section also shows the change in Interest Receivable: -18176.52, which supports the increase from 0 to 18176.52.\n4. The income statement shows Interest Income as 18176.52, which aligns with the accrued interest amount by the end date.\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '18176.52'}}\n````",
