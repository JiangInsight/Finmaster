The task is to identify the total amount of tax an entity is expected to pay or recover during the reporting period from the financial statements.\n\n2. Typically, this information is found under line items such as \"Taxes Payable\" on the balance sheet and \"Tax Expense\" on the income statement.\n\n3. From the balance sheet:\n   - Taxes Payable (End amount): 1,015,922.54\n\n4. From the income statement:\n   - Tax Expense: 1,015,922.54\n\n5. The tax expense matches the taxes payable, indicating this is the total tax amount expected to pay for the period.\n\nHence, the total tax amount expected to pay is 1,015,922.54.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"1015922.54\"}}\n```",
