Therefore, strictly speaking, the amounts owed to the entity did not decrease but increased during the period. \n\nHowever, since the instruction is to identify and extract the \"decrease\" in amounts owed (which would be indicated by a positive number here), the only relevant line is the \"Accounts Receivable\" line and the given value is -12792007.89.\n\nTherefore, the required solution is:  \n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-12792007.89\"}}\n```",
