The carrying amount of inventories sold is typically represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) line item in the income statement.\n2. In the provided income statement, the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" has the amount 14600000.00.\n3. This value represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '14600000.00'}}\n```",
