                        "content": "Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services to customers normally include \"Selling Expenses\" and \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\n- \"Cost of Goods Sold\" represents the cost directly related to delivering the goods and services to customers.\n- \"Selling Expenses\" typically include costs directly related to securing customer orders such as sales commissions, advertising, and distribution expenses.\n\nGiven the problem statement and the example where only \"Selling Expenses\" was extracted, here we should consider both because the question explicitly asks for costs incurred to secure orders and deliver goods/services.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 14,600,000.00\n- Selling Expenses = 1,325,774.90\n\nAdding these gives: 14,600,000.00 + 1,325,774.90 = 15,925,774.90\n\nIf the task expects just the amount related to securing orders and delivering goods/services as a single value, this sum would be appropriate.\n\nHence:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"15925774.90\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\nIf the instructions imply to extract only the value of \"Selling Expenses\" as in the example, then:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"1325774.90\"}}\n```\n\nBut since the problem states \"costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services,\" it's proper to include both.\n\nTherefore final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"15925774.90\"}}\n```",
