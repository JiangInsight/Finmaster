Despite the cash on hand being negative (which is unusual, but we respect given data), total cash and cash equivalents = -1,980,427.60 + 385,137.69 = -1,595,289.91\n\nThis matches the \"Ending Balance\" of Cash and Cash Equivalents in the cash flow statement.\n\nStep 2: Total Current Liabilities at 2024-02-05\n\nFrom balance sheet:\n\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n\nStep 3: Calculate ratio\n\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = -1,595,289.91 / 1,015,922.54 = approximately -1.57\n\nA negative ratio suggests that cash and cash equivalents are negative (perhaps due to overdrafts or data error), which indicates the company does not have cash to cover its current debt.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"-1.57\"}}",
