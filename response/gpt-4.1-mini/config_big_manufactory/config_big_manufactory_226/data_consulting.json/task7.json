To find CapEx for FCF, we take the amount spent on fixed assets as positive because it reduces cash.\n\nSo:\n\nFCF = (-18,924,462.44) - 2,670,827.47  \nFCF = -21,595,289.91\n\nThis matches the Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents (-21,595,289.91) which is consistent.\n\nHence,\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-21595289.91\"}}\n```",
