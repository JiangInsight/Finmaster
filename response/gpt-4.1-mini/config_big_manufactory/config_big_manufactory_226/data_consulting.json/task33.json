Assuming total liabilities = total assets - equity = 30,858,088.75 - 29,842,166.21 = 1,015,922.54 (same as current liabilities).  \n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Liabilities  \n= (-18,924,462.44) / 1,015,922.54 = approximately -18.63\n\n---\n\n3. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**  \nFormula: Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  \n\nNo beginning inventory given, so use ending inventory only (usual if no beginning inventory).  \n\nInventory Turnover = 14,600,000.00 / 9,100,000.00 = approximately 1.604\n\n---\n\n4. **Debt to Equity Ratio**  \nDebt to Equity = Total Liabilities / Total Equity  \n\n= 1,015,922.54 / 29,842,166.21 = approximately 0.034\n\n---\n\n5. **Quick Ratio**  \nQuick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory  \nQuick Assets = 20,314,894.50 - 9,100,000.00 = 11,214,894.50  \n\nQuick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities  \n\n= 11,214,894.50 / 1,015,922.54 = approximately 11.04\n\n---\n\n6. **Current Ratio**  \nCurrent Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \n\n= 20,314,894.50 / 1,015,922.54 = approximately 20.00\n\n---\n\n### Final rounded to 2 decimals:\n\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -18.63  \n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -18.63  \n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = 1.60  \n- Debt to Equity Ratio = 0.03  \n- Quick Ratio = 11.04  \n- Current Ratio = 20.00\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-18.63\",\n  \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-18.63\",\n  \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"1.60\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n  \"Quick Ratio\": \"11.04\",\n  \"Current Ratio\": \"20.00\"\n}}\n```",
