The amounts shown in the \"amount\" or \"cost_per_unit\" columns (cost_per_unit multiplied by quantity) indicate how much was spent to acquire the products.\n\n**Step 2: Identify all Sale transactions and find the total cost_amount related to sales (cost of products sold).**  \nThe \"cost_amount\" in sale records indicates the cost incurred for each sale, which directly contributes to the COGS.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total COGS by summing the cost_amount of all sales.**  \nThe sum of all \"cost_amount\" values in sales reflects the cost of goods that were sold during the period.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Sum of Purchases\n\nPurchases in the data (grouped by product_id and purchase):\n\n- Heavy Equipment D (P004):\n  - 1 unit at 1,500,000 = 1,500,000\n  - 2 units at 1,500,000 each = 3,000,000\n  - 2 units at 1,500,000 each = 3,000,000\n  - 2 units at 1,500,000 each = 3,000,000  \n  - 1 unit at 1,500,000 = 1,500,000  \n  Total for P004 purchases: 1,500,000 + 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 12,000,000\n\n- Heavy Equipment C (P003):\n  - 1 unit at 1,000,000 = 1,000,000\n  - 2 units at 1,000,000 each = 2,000,000\n  - 2 units at 1,000,000 each = 2,000,000\n  - 2 units at 1,000,000 each = 2,000,000  \n  Total for P003 purchases: 1,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 7,000,000\n\n- Heavy Equipment B (P002):\n  - 2 units at 800,000 each = 1,600,000\n  - 2 units at 800,000 each = 1,600,000  \n  Total for P002 purchases: 1,600,000 + 1,600,000 = 3,200,000\n\n- Heavy Equipment A (P001):\n  - 2 units at 500,000 each = 1,000,000\n  - 1 unit at 500,000 = 500,000\n  - 2 units at 500,000 each = 1,000,000  \n  Total for P001 purchases: 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 = 2,500,000\n\n**Sum of all purchases: 12,000,000 + 7,000,000 + 3,200,000 + 2,500,000 = 24,700,000**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Sum Cost Amount of Sales\n\nSum the \"cost_amount\" from all Sales lines (cost_amount is given explicitly):\n\n- Sale records with cost_amount:\n\n| product_id | cost_amount       |\n|------------|-------------------|\n| P004       | 1,500,000.0       |\n| P004       | 3,000,000.0       |\n| P003       | 1,000,000.0       |\n| P004       | 1,500,000.0       |\n| P004       | 1,500,000.0       |\n| P003       | 1,000,000.0       |\n| P004       | 1,500,000.0       |\n| P003       | 1,000,000.0       |\n| P002       | 800,000.0         |\n| P002       | 800,000.0         |\n| P001       | 500,000.0         |\n| P001       | 500,000.0         |\n| P001       | 500,000.0         |\n\nNote that some sales involve less quantity than purchases; but cost_amount is per sale.\n\nBy going through sales, the cost_amount fields given in the sale transactions sum up to:\n\n- Sale20240105004: 1,000,000.0  \n- Sale20240107006: 1,500,000.0  \n- Sale20240111008: 500,000.0  \n- Sale20240114011: 1,000,000.0  \n- Sale20240117015: 800,000.0  \n- Sale20240118016: 1,500,000.0  \n- Sale20240119018: 500,000.0  \n- Sale20240121020: 500,000.0  \n- Sale20240125022: 500,000.0  \n- Sale20240131029: 1,000,000.0  \n- Sale20240201031: 1,500,000.0  \n- Sale20240203034: 1,500,000.0  \n- Sale20240204037: 800,000.0  \n\nSum them up:\n\n1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 800,000 + 1,500,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,500,000 + 800,000  \n= 12,700,000.0\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Final COGS\n\nThe Cost of Goods Sold is the sum of the cost amounts of goods that were sold: **12,700,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"12700000.00\"}}\n```",
