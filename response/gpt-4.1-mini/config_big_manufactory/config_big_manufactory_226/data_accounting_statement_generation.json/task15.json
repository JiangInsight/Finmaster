Identify liabilities in the initial balances.\n2. Identify liabilities from transactions that affect liabilities.\n3. Sum the amounts to get initial liabilities.\n4. Calculate the final liabilities after all transactions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify Initial Liabilities\n\nThe initial data includes initial balances on 2023-12-31:\n\n- Cash deposit: 5,000,000.0 (Asset)\n- Bank deposit: 15,000,000.0 (Asset)\n- Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.0 (Asset)\n\nNo initial liabilities listed explicitly. So initial liabilities = 0.00\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify Liabilities from Transactions\n\nCheck for purchases or entries with unpaid status or payment methods like \"Account Payable\" which indicate liabilities.\n\nLook for purchases marked as Unpaid or using Account Payable.\n\n- From the data, check all purchases with **payment/receipt_status** = \"Unpaid\" or with \"Account Payable\" payment methods.\n\nScan entries:\n\n- There is no explicit \"Account Payable\" payment_status in this problem statement, but \"payment_method\" field can indicate liabilities.\n\n- The data includes many purchases, some with \"Paid\" and some with \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" methods; if paid, no liabilities remain.\n\n- Since all purchase entries show \"Paid\" under payment/receipt_status, it implies the liabilities were settled.\n\n- There are no purchase transactions marked as \"Unpaid.\" So no new current liabilities.\n\nCheck any line specifically representing liabilities or unpaid obligations => None explicitly given.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Summary of Liabilities:\n\n- Initial liabilities: 0.00 (since none shown)\n- Final liabilities: 0.00 (no unpaid or accounts payable outstanding)\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Confirming no unpaid balances or unpaid purchase liabilities\n\n- All purchases shown have payment/receipt_status = Paid.\n- No \"Account Payable\" entries with unpaid balances.\n- Interest receivables and expenses do not increase liabilities.\n\nHence, total liabilities remain zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
