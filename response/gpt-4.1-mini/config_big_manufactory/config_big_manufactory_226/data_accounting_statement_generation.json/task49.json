We consider all sales (paid and unpaid) revenue.  \n- Costs of sales (cost_amount): Summed from sales transactions.  \n- Expenses (Administrative, Sales, Financial): Sum all paid expenses  \n- Depreciation: Summed from depreciation entries\n\nTotal Sales after_tax_amount ≈ 31,779,005.25 (from all sales)  \nTotal Cost of Goods Sold ≈ 20,700,000 (approximation from purchases and sales cost amounts)  \nExpenses sum (Administrative + Sales + Financial) ≈ 1,800,000 (sum of given expenses paid)  \nDepreciation ≈ 127,633.22  \n\nNet profit = Sales - COGS - Expenses - Depreciation  \n= 31,779,005.25 - 20,700,000 - 1,800,000 - 127,633.22 = approx 11,406,086.89\n\n**Step 3: Adjustments for working capital changes**  \n- (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable: sum of sales unpaid balances - sum previous? Here approximate using customer unpaid sales. Approximate unpaid sales value ≈ 18,710,161.03 (net increase in receivables = cash not collected)  \n- (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable: sum of unpaid interest receivables balances; approximate net change -10,159.40  \n- (Increase) Decrease in Inventory: purchases paid (and unpaid not affecting cash) assumed: 11,000,000 increase in inventory (cash outflow for inventory increase)  \n- Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable: no explicit unpaid payables provided or zero net movement  \n- Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable: no data, assumed zero\n\n**Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities** =  \nNet Profit + Depreciation - Increase in Accounts Receivable - Increase in Interest Receivable - Increase in Inventory + Increase in Payables + Increase in Tax Payables  \n= 11,406,086.89 + 127,633.22 - 18,710,161.03 - 10,159.40 - 11,000,000 + 0 + 0  \n= -25,409,100.32 (cash outflow)\n\n**Step 4: Investing Activities**  \n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: sum of all fixed asset purchases paid ≈ 3,937,077.52  \n- No disposals recorded\n\nNet Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -3,937,077.52\n\n**Step 5: Cash and Cash Equivalents and Ending Balance**  \n- Beginning balance cash and bank = 20,000,000  \n- Net decrease cash = Operating + Investing = -25,409,100.32 - 3,937,077.52 = -29,346,177.84  \n- Ending balance = 20,000,000 - 29,346,177.84 = -9,346,177.84 (negative indicates overdraft or deficit)\n\n**Step 6: Summary**  \n- Cash Flow From Operating Activities: 11,406,086.89 (Net Profit)  \n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -25,409,100.32  \n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 3,937,077.52  \n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -3,937,077.52  \n- Net Increase in Cash: -29,346,177.84\n\n**Notes:**  \n- Transfers between cash and bank do not affect total cash and cash equivalents, ignored in net cash flow calculation.  \n- No tax payable data available, assumed zero.  \n- Unpaid purchases considered not cash impact yet except those marked as paid.  \n- Interest receivable changes included as working capital adjustment.  \n- Depreciation is non-cash added back.  \n\nThis produces a cash flow statement showing a net cash decrease mainly due to large inventory purchases and accounts receivable increases.",
