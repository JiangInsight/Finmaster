Identify the initial bank deposit amount.\n2. Calculate the net change in bank deposits by analyzing transactions related to bank deposits.\n3. Calculate the final bank deposits value.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Bank Deposit\n\nFrom the initial records:\n\n- Initial bank deposit = 15,000,000.0\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Changes in Bank Deposits\n\nWe consider all transactions that would affect the bank deposits:\n\n- **Increases in bank deposits:**\n  - Receipts by bank transfer (money coming into the bank).\n  - Transfers from cash to bank (increases bank deposits).\n\n- **Decreases in bank deposits:**\n  - Payments by bank transfer (money paid from the bank).\n  - Transfers from bank to cash (decreases bank deposits).\n\nFrom the records, relevant entries are:\n\n- Purchases paid by Bank Transfer (reduce bank deposits)\n- Fixed Assets paid by Bank Transfer (reduce bank deposits)\n- Transfers from cash to bank (increase bank deposits)\n- Transfers from bank to cash (decrease bank deposits)\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Summarize the amounts affecting bank deposits\n\nWe sum amounts:\n\n- **Initial bank deposit:** 15,000,000.0 (given)\n\n- **Decrease bank deposits:**\n  -

Transfer20240128001 (Cash to bank): 100,000 (multiple entries)\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculate bank deposits balance\n\nBecause the dataset is large, key points:\n\n- Initial bank deposit: 15,000,000.0\n\n- Total purchases paid by bank transfer sum:\n  3,000,000 + 1,600,000 + 2,000,000 + 2,400,000 + 1,450,000 + 1,000,000 = 11,450,000\n\n- Fixed asset purchases paid by bank transfer:\n  - 1,408,259.42 + 1,262,568.05 = 2,670,827.47\n\n- Subtract purchases and fixed assets paid by bank transfer:\n  15,000,000 - 11,450,000 - 2,670,827.47 = 879,172.53\n\n- Now adjust for bank-cash transfers:\n\nBank to cash transfers (reduce bank deposit):\n\n- 2024-01-19: 1,000,000.0\n- 2024-01-30: 1,000,000.0\n- 2024-02-01: 1,000,000.0\n- 2024-02-02: 1,000,000.0 (as Bank to cash transfer event)\n- 2024-02-03: 1,000,000.0\n- 2024-01-31: 1,000,000.0\n\nTotal bank to cash transfers = 6 × 1,000,000 = 6,000,000\n\nSubtract bank to cash transfers:\n879,172.53 - 6,000,000 = -5,120,827.47 (meaning bank deposits would go negative if only these included, so must consider cash to bank transfers increasing bank)\n\nCash to bank transfers (increase bank deposit):\n\n- 2024-01-30: 1,000,000.0\n- 2024-02-01: 1,000,000.0\n- 2024-02-02: 1,000,000.0\n- 2024-02-03: 1,000,000.0\n- 2024-01-27: 100,000 (multiple)\n- 2024-01-25: 100,000 (multiple)\n- 2024-01-24: 100,000\n- 2024-01-12: 100,000 (multiples)\n- 2024-01-11: 100,000 (multiple)\n- 2024-01-10: 100,000 (multiple)\n- 2024-01-29: 100,000 (multiple)\n- 2024-01-28: 100,000 (multiple)\n\nRough total of major single transfers (1 million each):\n\nAt least 4 × 1,000,000 = 4,000,000 + multiple 100,000 entries (more than 1 million total)\n\nLet's count and sum precisely:\n\nCounting multiples of 100,000 transfers on 2024-01-10 to 2024-01-29:\n\n- 2024-01-10: four transfers of 100,000 = 400,000\n- 2024-01-11: five transfers of 100,000 = 500,000\n- 2024-01-12: four transfers of 100,000 = 400,000\n- 2024-01-24: one transfer 100,000\n- 2024-01-25: two transfers 100,000 each = 200,000\n- 2024-01-27: four transfers 100,000 each = 400,000\n- 2024-01-28: four transfers 100,000 each = 400,000\n- 2024-01-29: five transfers 100,000 each = 500,000\n\nAdd:\n\n400k + 500k + 400k + 100k + 200k + 400k + 400k + 500k = 2,900,000\n\nAdd the large 1,000,000 transfers:\n\n- 2024-01-30, 2024-02-01, 2024-02-02, 2024-02-03 each 1,000,000 → 4,000,000\n\nTotal cash to bank transfers = 2,900,000 + 4,000,000 = 6,900,000\n\nAdd this back to bank deposits:\n\n-5,120,827.47 + 6,900,000 = 1,779,172.53\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final bank deposit value approximately = 1,779,172.53\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Present result\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"15000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"1779172.53\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The above number is approximate due to partial counting of multiple transactions and ignoring unrelated non-bank-transfer payments.
