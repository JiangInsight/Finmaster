                        "content": "To calculate the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities, we follow the standard approach in the cash flow statement:\n\n**Step 1: Identify cash inflows from operating activities**\n- Cash received from customers (Sales): Only consider sales where payment is \"Paid\" and payment_method is Cash or Bank Transfer.\n- Interest received (Interest Receivables) is usually operating inflow, but many records are unpaid (accrued).\n- Ignore transfers between cash and bank accounts as these are financing/investing activities or cash management, not operating cash flow.\n\n**Step 2: Identify cash outflows from operating activities**\n- Payments for purchases (Supplies inventory) - but purchases are investing or operating depending on inventory vs fixed assets (these appear to be heavy equipment, likely investing - so we exclude purchases as investing outflows).\n- Expenses paid: Administrative Expenses, Sales Expenses, Financial Expenses with status \"Paid\" and paid by cash or bank transfer.\n- Interest paid is not clearly identified here; only Interest Receivables is present (which is income).\n\n**Step 3: Adjust for non-cash expenses**\n- Depreciation charges are non-cash, so add them back.\n\n---\n\n### Analyze provided data\n\n- Initial deposits and Fixed assets are opening balances, not affecting cash flow for the period.\n\n- Purchases involve Heavy Equipment; usually considered investing activities — exclude from operating activities.\n\n- Sales records: distinguish between Paid and Unpaid. Only Paid sales bring cash inflows.\n\n- Expenses: Only Paid expenses with payment_method Cash or Bank Transfer are cash outflows.\n\n- Depreciation: add back as non-cash expenses.\n\n- Interest Receivables: unpaid ones are accrued income, no cash yet; no paid interest receivable recorded here, so exclude them.\n\n- Transfers (Cash to bank transfer, Bank to cash transfer): internal cash management, exclude.\n\n---\n\n### Calculate:\n\n1. **Cash received from customers (Sales): sum sales with payment/receipt_status = \"Paid\"**\n\nSales with Paid status:\n\n| Sale ID        | amount   | payment_method | payment/receipt_status |\n|----------------|----------|----------------|-----------------------|\n| Sale20240105004 | 1463032.36 | Cash          | Paid                  |\n| Sale20240107006 | 2159586.87 | Cash          | Paid                  |\n| Sale20240111008 | 749601.75  | Account Receivable, but payment_status is Unpaid -
