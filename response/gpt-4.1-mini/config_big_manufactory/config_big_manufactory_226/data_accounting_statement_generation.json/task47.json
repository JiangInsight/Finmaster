But the problem states \"cash and cash equivalents\", so include both cash and bank transactions.\n\nCash sales paid (in cash): considered above.\n\nSimilarly, sales paid by bank transfer should be considered inflows to cash equivalents.\n\nSimilarly, purchases and expenses paid by bank transfer are outflows from cash equivalents.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Calculate bank inflows and outflows\n\n#### 6.1 Sales paid by Bank Transfer:\n\nLook for sale with payment_status \"Paid\" and payment_method likely bank (or empty meaning bank):\n\nFrom data:\n\n- Sale20240105004: Cash (already counted)\n\n- Sale20240107006: Cash (counted)\n\n- Sale20240111008: Unpaid\n\n- Sale20240114011: Unpaid\n\n- Sale20240121020: Cash\n\nNo sales clearly saying paid by bank transfer in payment_method.\n\nSo likely bank transfers are not specified in sales but appear in purchase payment_methods?\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Purchases paid by bank transfer:\n\n- Purchase20231231002: 3,000,000 Bank Transfer, Paid\n\n- Purchase20231231006: 2,000,000 Bank Transfer, Paid\n\n- Purchase20231231007: 2,400,000 Bank Transfer, Paid\n\n- Purchase20231231012: 1,000,000 Bank Transfer, Paid\n\n- Purchase20231231014: 3,000,000 Cash\n\n- Fixed Asset Purchases:\n\n  - FixedAsset20231231001: 1,262,568.05 Bank Transfer\n\n  - FixedAsset20231231001: 1,408,259.42 Bank Transfer\n\n- Purchase20231231003:  1,600,000 Bank Transfer\n\n- Purchase20231231009: 1,000,000 Bank Transfer\n\n- Purchase20231231013: 3,000,000 Cash\n\n- Purchase20231231011: 500,000 Cash\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Expenses paid by bank transfer?\n\nMost expenses show payment_method = Cash. No explicit bank expenses seem noted.\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: Bank inflows and outflows net effect\n\nBank inflows:\n\n- Initial bank deposit: 15,000,000\n\n- Cash transferred from bank to cash: e.g. multiple transfers total.\n\nLook at totals of bank to cash transfers:\n\n- 2024-01-19: 1,000,000 Bank to cash transfer (+1,000,000 cash)\n\n- 2024-01-30: 1,000,000 Bank to cash transfer (+1,000,000 cash)\n\n- 2024-01-31: 1,000,000 Bank to cash transfer (+1,000,000 cash)\n\n- 2024-02-01: 1,000,000 Bank to cash transfer (+1,000,000 cash)\n\n- 2024-02-02: 1,000,000 Bank to cash transfer (+1,000,000 cash)\n\n- 2024-02-03: 1,000,000 Bank to cash transfer (+1,000,000 cash)\n\n- 2024-02-04: 1,000,000 Bank to cash transfer (+1,000,000 cash)\n\n- 2024-01-31, similar multiple cash to bank transfers of 1,000,000 each\n\n- These transfers largely offset, so no net effect on cash + cash equivalents.\n\n---\n\n### Step 10: Simplify approach\n\nBecause cash and bank are cash and cash equivalents and transfers between them do not impact total cash + cash equivalents, total ending balance would be:\n\n**Ending cash and cash equivalents = Initial cash + bank + Net cash inflows from sales - cash outflows (purchases, expenses) - Fixed assets paid with cash and bank**\n\n- Initial cash + bank = 20,000,000\n\n- Sales cash received (cash payments) = +7,526,442.78\n\n- Purchases paid by cash = 8,500,000 (from above)\n\n- Purchases paid by bank transfer = sum of purchases paid by bank:\n\n  From above list:\n\n  3,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 2,400,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,600,000 + 1,000,000 = 10,000,000\n\n- Fixed assets paid by bank:\n\n  1,262,568.05 + 1,408,259.42 = approximately 2,670,827.47\n\n- Expenses paid by cash: 1,760,965.01\n\n- Expenses paid by bank? None obvious.\n\n- Sales cash receipts paid by bank: None obvious – so only cash sales paid count as inflows.\n\n---\n\n### Step 11: Compute net effect\n\nStarting cash + bank: 20,000,000  \nAdd cash sales received: +7,526,442.78  \nSubtract purchases paid by cash: -8,500,000  \nSubtract purchases paid by bank: -10,000,000  \nSubtract fixed assets paid by bank: -2,670,827.47  \nSubtract expenses paid by cash: -1,760,965.01  \n\nCalculate:\n\n20,000,000 + 7,526,442.78 = 27,526,442.78  \n27,526,442.78 - 8,500,000 = 19,026,442.78  \n19,026,442.78 - 10,000,000 = 9,026,442.78  \n9,026,442.78 - 2,670,827.47 = 6,355,615.31  \n6,355,615.31 - 1,760,965.01 = 4,594,650.30  \n\n---\n\n### Step 12: No entry suggests cash or bank inflows beyond sales paid and transfers (which net out).
