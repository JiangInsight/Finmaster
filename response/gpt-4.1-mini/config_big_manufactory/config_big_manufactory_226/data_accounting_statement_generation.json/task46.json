The initial cash and bank deposits as the starting balance of cash and cash equivalents (these are the cash-related initial balances).\n2. Subtract cash payments that reduce cash.\n3. Add cash receipts that increase cash.\n4. Transfer between cash and bank accounts do not affect total cash and cash equivalents balance since they just move funds internally between cash and bank.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify initial cash and bank deposit balances (at 2023-12-31)\n\n- Cash deposit: 5,000,000\n- Bank deposit: 15,000,000\n\nSum initial cash and cash equivalents = 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 = 20,000,000\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify cash-related transactions (post 2023-12-31) affecting cash balance\n\nLook for transactions with:\n\n- payment/receipt_status = \"Paid\" AND payment_method = \"Cash\" (cash outflows)\n- payment_method = \"Cash\" for sales with receive_method \"Cash\" (cash inflows)\n\nCash outflows decrease cash balance, cash inflows increase cash balance.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Add cash receipts (cash inflows) from Sales with receive_method = Cash and payment_status = Paid\n\nSales cash receipts (payment_method not given, but sales with receive_method=\"Cash\" and \"Paid\" status):\n\nFrom sales rows with:\n\n- \"Sale\" type\n- payment/receipt_status: \"Paid\"\n- receive_method: \"Cash\"\n\nSum these amounts.\n\nReviewing the given data:\n\nSales with Paid and Cash:\n\n- 2024-01-05 Sale: 1,463,032.36 (Cash) -
