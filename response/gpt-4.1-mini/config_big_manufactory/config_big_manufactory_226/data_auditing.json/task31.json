This likely indicates duplicated entry with inconsistency in quantity and amounts.\n- Based on the first entry with Staff as preparer and amount 46979.81, the second entry's \"recorded_quantity\", \"recorded_amount\", and \"recorded_preparer\" fields appear inconsistent.\n- The \"quantity\" is not given explicitly for expense, but the doubled amount indicates that the second entry's quantity might be incorrectly recorded as 2 instead of 1.\n- So corrected quantity is 1.0, and amount should be 37338.47 (half of 74676.94).\n- Approver \"Director\" is consistent; preparer recorded as Supervisor while original is Staff - the original preparer should be Staff.\n- The discrepancy appears mainly in preparer, quantity (implied), and amount fields.",
