All fields, including payment method and statuses, quantities, prices, and amounts are coherent and consistent.\n\nNo corrections or mismatches were identified.\n\nHence, the solution is the record with no inconsistencies found. If requested to output only inconsistencies, then no entries. Since task wants inconsistencies only, and none found, the solution is empty or no inconsistency report.\n\nAccording to instructions, if no inconsistency found, no output needed. But for completion, no inconsistencies found in provided transactions.",
