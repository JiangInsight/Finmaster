No other transaction showed discrepancies in this dataset except one flagged but not repeated here.\n\nThe only detected issue was for Sale20240125020 in the problem statement, but here no issue is present in the provided data snippet. So only one transaction with inconsistency to report is Sale20240125020 (from the problem text) which is outside this response's transactions.\n\nHence, in this dataset, no internal inconsistency was found besides the original problem note relating to Sale20240125020.",
