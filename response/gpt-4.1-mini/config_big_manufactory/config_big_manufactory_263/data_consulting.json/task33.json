                        "content": "We are given three financial statements and need to calculate the following ratios:\n\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities  \n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Liabilities  \n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  \n- Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity  \n- Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities  \n- Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Extract relevant data from the statements (using end amounts/dates)\n\n**From Balance Sheet (at 2024-02-05):**\n\n- Current Assets = 21,224,639.20  \n- Inventory = 8,400,000.00  \n- Current Liabilities = 727,140.68  \n- Total Liabilities = Since only current liabilities are shown, and no other liabilities, total liabilities = current liabilities = 727,140.68  \n- Owner's Equity = 28,405,999.64  \n\n**From Cash Flow Statement:**\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -17,417,367.15  \n\n**From Income Statement:**\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = 10,400,000.00  \n- Net Profit = 405,999.64  \n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Average Inventory\n\nThe beginning inventory is not provided directly. The initial Inventory at 2023-12-31 is 0.00, End inventory 8,400,000.00.\n\nSo, Average Inventory = (0 + 8,400,000) / 2 = 4,200,000.00\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate each ratio\n\n1. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**  \n= Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities  \n= (-17,417,367.15) / 727,140.68  \n≈ -23.95  \n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**  \n= Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Liabilities  \n= (-17,417,367.15) / 727,140.68  \n≈ -23.95  \n\n3. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**  \n= Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  \n= 10,400,000 / 4,200,000  \n≈ 2.48  \n\n4. **Debt to Equity Ratio**  \n= Total Liabilities / Owner's Equity  \n= 727,140.68 / 28,405,999.64  \n≈ 0.0256 ≈ 0.03  \n\n5. **Quick Ratio**  \n= (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities  \n= (21,224,639.20 - 8,400,000) / 727,140.68  \n= 12,824,639.20 / 727,140.68  \n≈ 17.64  \n\n6. **Current Ratio**  \n= Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \n= 21,224,639.20 / 727,140.68  \n≈ 29.19  \n\n---\n\n### Final formatted solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-23.95\", \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-23.95\", \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"2.48\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"17.64\", \"Current Ratio\": \"29.19\"}}\n```",
