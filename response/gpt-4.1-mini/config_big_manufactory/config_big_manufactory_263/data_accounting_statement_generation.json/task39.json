Identify all \"Interest Receivables\" transaction amounts on both the beginning and ending dates.\n2. Determine the interest receivable balance at the beginning and at the end of the period.\n3. Calculate the change as (Ending Balance - Beginning Balance).\n4. The sign convention in cash flow statements typically shows an increase in receivables as a use of cash (negative adjustment), and a decrease as a source of cash (positive adjustment).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify initial Interest Receivable amount (at the start of the period)\n\nThe initial date given is 2023-12-31.\n\n- There are several transactions, but only one relevant interest receivable on or before this date is the initial state.\n\nFrom problem data, no explicit initial interest receivable balance is shown before 2024-01-01.\n\nGiven that first Interest Receivables transactions start from 2024-01-01, we assume that the opening balance (on 2023-12-31) = **0**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Ending Balance of Interest Receivables\n\nList all interest receivable amounts (unpaid) for dates from 2024-01-01 through the latest available date in the data (up to 2024-02-05).\n\nFrom the problem data:\n\n| Date       | Amount (Interest Receivables) | Notes            |\n|------------|-------------------------------|------------------|\n| 2024-01-01 | 1335.0                        | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-02 | 1335.0                        | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-03 | 1246.0                        | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-04 | 1246.0                        | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-05 | 1246.0                        | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-06 | 1068.0                        | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-07 | 1068.0                        | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-08 | 801.0                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-09 | 729.8                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-10 | 729.8                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-11 | 729.8                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-12 | 729.8                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-13 | 729.8                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-14 | 729.8                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-15 | 685.3                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-16 | 418.3                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-17 | 418.3                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-18 | 418.3                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-19 | 418.3                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-20 | 418.3                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-21 | 418.3                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-22 | 418.3                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-23 | 418.3                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-24 | 418.3                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-25 | 418.3                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-26 | 275.9                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-27 | 275.9                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-28 | 275.9                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-29 | 275.9                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-30 | 186.9                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-01-31 | 186.9                         | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-02-01 | 97.9                          | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-02-02 | 97.9                          | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-02-03 | 97.9                          | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-02-04 | 97.9                          | Unpaid           |\n| 2024-02-05 | 97.9                          | Unpaid           |\n\nOnly one interest receivable entry per date, no payments on them shown, so the last recorded interest receivable amount is on 2024-02-05 with 97.9.\n\nThus, the **ending balance** of Interest Receivable is the last unpaid amount, which is **97.9**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate total accrued interest receivables during the period\n\nActually, for change in Interest Receivable, we do:\n\n- Closing balance (at end date - latest date) minus Opening balance (at start date).\n\n- Opening interest receivable = 0 (assuming at 2023-12-31)\n\n- Closing interest receivable = 97.9 (at 2024-02-05)\n\nTherefore,\n\nIncrease in Interest Receivable = 97.9 - 0 = +97.9\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Check if any payments of Interest Receivable are recorded\n\nNo \"Interest Receivables\" entries with status \"Paid\" or similar indicating collection of interest receivable were present in the problem.\n\nHence, no direct reduction is recorded, so no adjustment.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final answer\n\nThe increase in Interest Receivable is **97.9**\n\nIn cash flow statement, an increase in interest receivable is a use of cash and is presented as a negative adjustment.\n\nSo,\n\n**(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable = -97.9**\n\n---\n\n## Final solution JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-97.9\"}}\n```",
