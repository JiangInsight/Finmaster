                        "content": "To find the **Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable** item for the cash flow statement, the typical approach is:\n\n1. Calculate **Tax Payable at the end** (sum of tax liabilities accrued/invoiced but not yet paid).\n2. Calculate **Tax Payable at the beginning** (usually given or can be the initial tax recorded).\n3. The difference between the two is the increase or decrease in tax payable.\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- We are focusing on the tax-related amounts in sales and purchases.\n- Tax amounts related to purchases are typically input VAT or tax credits; tax amounts related to sales are output VAT or tax liabilities.\n- Expenses (admin, financial, sales) typically do not have tax amounts listed here.\n- Tax payable = Output Tax (Tax collected on sales) - Input Tax (Tax paid on purchases).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify tax amounts on sales (Output Tax)\n\nLook at rows with \"Sale\" type and noted tax_amount (output VAT):\n\n- Sale20240104001: tax_amount = 52,092.43\n- Sale20240108002: tax_amount = 68,904.10\n- Sale20240109003: tax_amount = 74,449.45\n- Sale20240113005: tax_amount = 33,441.54\n- Sale20240114007: tax_amount = 32,911.01\n- Sale20240115009: tax_amount = 105,303.36\n- Sale20240118012: tax_amount = 55,272.30\n- Sale20240119014: tax_amount = 110,026.52\n- Sale20240120015: tax_amount = 74,895.86\n- Sale20240122018: tax_amount = 53,435.55\n- Sale20240125020: tax_amount = 66,408.56\n\nSum these output tax amounts:\n\n52092.43 + 68904.10 + 74449.45 + 33441.54 + 32911.01 + 105303.36 + 55272.30 + 110026.52 + 74895.86 + 53435.55 + 66408.56\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n- 52,092.43\n+ 68,904.10 = 120,996.53\n+ 74,449.45 = 195,445.98\n+ 33,441.54 = 228,887.52\n+ 32,911.01 = 261,798.53\n+ 105,303.36 = 367,101.89\n+ 55,272.30 = 422,374.19\n+ 110,026.52 = 532,400.71\n+ 74,895.86 = 607,296.57\n+ 53,435.55 = 660,732.12\n+ 66,408.56 = 727,140.68\n\n**Total Output Tax = 727,140.68**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify tax amounts on purchases (Input Tax)\n\nLook at rows with \"Purchase\" type. Tax amount is not explicitly given in these rows, but purchase amount is given, and cost_per_unit is given but no clear tax_amount.\n\nBut since no explicit tax amount is given for purchases, assumptions:\n\n- If tax amount is not given explicitly on purchases, we cannot sum input tax directly.\n- From the original examples, tax is shown only on sales side.\n\nIf no tax info on purchases, then the tax payable is the total tax accrued on sales minus tax payments on tax liabilities or input tax credits.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Consider tax paid or changes\n\nSince tax payable is a liability account, its increase/decrease can be inferred from the net tax accrued less tax paid.\n\nUnfortunately, no explicit columns for tax paid or tax payable at beginning or end are given.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Use rationale from initial example\n\nIn the initial example, the increase in tax payable was calculated and resulted in 271,550.92.\n\nGiven the data here, the total tax amount on sales approximately sums to 727,140.68.\n\nNo input VAT data to subtract. Also no tax payments data is provided.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nSince the problem data doesn't specify starting and ending tax payable or input tax, the best estimated increase in tax payable is equal to the total tax amount on sales (output VAT) accrued during the period.\n\nTherefore, the **Increase in Tax Payable = sum of tax_amount from sales = 727,140.68**\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": \"727140.68\"}}\n```",
