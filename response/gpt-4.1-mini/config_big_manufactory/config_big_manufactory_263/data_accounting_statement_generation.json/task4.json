                        "content": "To calculate the accounts receivable (AR) initial and ending amounts, we follow these steps:\n\n**1. Accounts Receivable Initial Value**  \nFrom the initial data, there is no explicit accounts receivable amount listed at the start (2023-12-31). The initial entries are:  \n- Cash deposit: 5,000,000.0  \n- Bank deposit: 15,000,000.0  \n- Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.0  \nNo accounts receivable initial balance is given.  \n**Therefore, initial AR = 0.00**\n\n**2. Accounts Receivable End Value**  \nAccounts receivable corresponds to amounts due from customers which are unpaid. This would be \"Sale\" transactions with payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\" and receive_method is \"Account Receviable\" or similar.  \nLet's sum up the amounts from such sales transactions.\n\nIdentifying all sales with:  \n- receive_method = \"Account Receviable\"  \n- payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\"\n\nFrom the table (some example rows):  \n\nSales with Unpaid and receive_method = Account Receviable, and their amounts:  \n- Sale20240104001: 1,041,848.53  \n- Sale20240108002: 1,378,082.08  \n- Sale20240114007: (Paid) so skip  \n- Sale20240115009: 2,106,067.17  \n- Sale20240118012: Paid, skip  \n- Sale20240119014: 2,200,530.42  \n- Sale20240120015: 1,497,917.1  \n- Sale20240122018: Paid, skip  \n- Sale20240125020: 1,328,171.21  \n- Sale20240113005: 668,830.84  \n- Sale20240113005 and Sale20240125020 appear to be unpaid, include both  \n- Sale20240124041 and Sale20240124042 not given  \n- Sale20240129054 and Sale20240129055 are Paid (Cash), skip  \n- Sale20240110016: Unpaid 124,688.16 (from example) not here but in original example anyway  \n- Sale20240131001 not given, etc.  \n\nWe must sum all \"Sale\" records that are Unpaid and receive_method = Account Receviable. For accuracy, I will extract from the presented data only:\n\n— From the problem data: scan and sum all Sale amounts with payment/receipt_status = Unpaid and receive_method = \"Account Receviable\"\n\nThe column names are:\n\n| id | type | date | recorded_date | amount | recorded_amount | cost_per_unit | approver | preparer | payment/receipt_status | payment_method | supplier_id | supplier_name | product_id | product_name | quantity | unit_price | receive_method | customer_id | tax_amount | after_tax_amount | cost_amount | profit |\n\nWe filter for rows where:  \n- type = Sale  \n- payment/receipt_status = Unpaid  \n- receive_method = Account Receviable\n\n**From above data:**\n\n- Sale20240104001 | amount: 1,041,848.53 | Unpaid | Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240108002 | amount:1,378,082.08 | Unpaid | Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240114007 | Paid | skip  \n- Sale20240115009 | amount: 2,106,067.17 | Unpaid | Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240119014 | amount: 2,200,530.42 | Unpaid | Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240120015 | amount: 1,497,917.1 | Unpaid | Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240122018 | Paid | skip  \n- Sale20240125020 | amount: 1,328,171.21 | Unpaid | Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240113005 | amount: 668,830.84 | Unpaid | Account Receviable  \n- Sale20240124041 and Sale20240124042 – missing from problem data above but not needed since not listed.  \n\nCalculating sum:  \n1,041,848.53 + 1,378,082.08 + 2,106,067.17 + 2,200,530.42 + 1,497,917.1 + 1,328,171.21 + 668,830.84 = ?\n\nLet's compute:\n\n- 1,041,848.53  \n+ 1,378,082.08 = 2,419,930.61  \n+ 2,106,067.17 = 4,525,997.78  \n+ 2,200,530.42 = 6,726,528.20  \n+ 1,497,917.1 = 8,224,445.30  \n+ 1,328,171.21 = 9,552,616.51  \n+ 668,830.84 = 10,221,447.35\n\nThese sum to 10,221,447.35\n\n**Therefore, final accounts receivable = 10,221,447.35**\n\n# Summary:\n\n- Initial AR = 0.00 (no initial AR given)  \n- End AR = sum of unpaid sales with Account Receivable = 10,221,447.35  \n\nFinal answer in required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"10221447.35\"} }\n```",
