Identify the opening Accounts Payable balance (at the beginning of the period).\n2. Identify the closing Accounts Payable balance (at the end of the period).\n3. Calculate the net change: Closing Accounts Payable - Opening Accounts Payable.\n\nGiven the nature of the data:\n\n- \"Accounts Payable\" corresponds to purchases made but *not paid* yet (payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\" and payment_method indicating liability, e.g., \"Account Payable\").\n\n- Opening accounts payable can be found by initial unpaid purchases at the start (often at 2023-12-31 or earlier).\n  \n- Purchases with status \"Unpaid\" increase accounts payable.\n  \n- Purchases with status \"Paid\" reduce accounts payable since the amounts have been settled.\n\n### Step 1: Determine opening balance of Accounts Payable\n\nLook for any initial unpaid purchases as of 2023-12-31.\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- Initial entries on 2023-12-31 have no unpaid purchases listed except for specific purchase entries marked Unpaid.\n\n- Relevant purchase entries with \"Unpaid\" at 2023-12-31:\n\n  - Purchase20231231004: 800,000 paid cash → Paid, so no accounts payable.\n\n  - Purchase20231231001: 800,000 Paid Cash → Paid.\n\n  - Purchase20231231002: 500,000 Paid Cash → Paid.\n\n  - Purchase20231231003: (doesn't appear in problem data).\n\n  - Purchase20231231012 or 13: Paid.\n\n- No purchases with status \"Unpaid\" at initial date seems to be in the problem dataset for 2023-12-31.\n\nHence opening accounts payable = 0 (no unpaid purchases at start).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate closing balance of Accounts Payable\n\nFind all purchases with payment_status = \"Unpaid\" to suppliers as of the reporting date (latest date in data).\n\nLooking at purchases marked \"Unpaid\" is key.\n\nFrom the dataset, we look for purchases with \"Unpaid\" status:\n\n- Purchase20231231004: Paid\n\n- Purchase20231231003, 09, 11 ... no evidence of \"Unpaid\" purchases.\n\nActually, going through the data, all purchase entries have \"Paid\" status for the problem dataset from the given data except:\n\n- There's no purchase explicitly marked \"Unpaid\".\n\nTherefore, unpaid purchases = 0.\n\nIf no opening balance and no unpaid purchases (liabilities) now, accounts payable did not increase.\n\nBut to confirm, check specifically for any \"Unpaid\" purchases:\n\n- In the original example, unpaid purchases existed, by contrast.\n\n- In this dataset, all purchases are Paid.\n\nConclusion: Opening Accounts Payable = 0, Closing Accounts Payable = 0.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\n\n= Closing Accounts Payable - Opening Accounts Payable = 0 - 0 = 0\n\n---\n\n### Final solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
