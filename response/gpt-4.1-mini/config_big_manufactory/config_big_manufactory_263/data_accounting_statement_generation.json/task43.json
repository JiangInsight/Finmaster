                        "content": "To calculate the **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities** from the given transactions, we need to identify all relevant cash inflows and outflows from operating activities.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify operating cash inflows and outflows\n\n**Operating cash inflows** typically include:\n- Cash received from customers (cash sales)\n- Interest received (only those actually received in cash, unpaid interest is non-cash)\n\n**Operating cash outflows** typically include:\n- Cash paid to suppliers (purchase expenses actually paid in cash)\n- Cash paid for operating expenses (administrative, sales, financial expenses paid in cash)\n- Interest paid (not explicitly given here, so ignored)\n- Depreciation is a non-cash charge and is added back in cash flow statement.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: From problem data, classify entries to compute net operating cash flow.\n\n---\n\n#### Initial Balances\n- Cash deposit: 5,000,000 (starting cash)\n- Bank deposit: 15,000,000 (bank balance, not cash)\n- Fixed Assets: 8,000,000 (investing activity, exclude from operating)\n\n---\n\n#### Purchases (Cash paid for goods/operations)\n- Consider only \"Paid\" purchases via Cash payment method (purchase is operating outflow):\n\nFrom purchases entries:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 800,000 paid, Cash -> Outflow: 800,000  \n- Purchase20231231002: 500,000 paid, Cash -> Outflow: 500,000  \n- Purchase20231231003: 1,000,000 paid, Bank Transfer -> Not cash  \n- Purchase20231231004: 800,000 paid, Cash -> Outflow: 800,000   \n- Purchase20231231005: 2,000,000 paid, Bank Transfer -> Not cash  \n- Purchase20231231006: 3,000,000 paid, Bank Transfer -> Not cash  \n- Purchase20231231007: 800,000 paid, Bank Transfer -> Not cash  \n- Purchase20231231008: 2,000,000 paid, Cash -> Outflow: 2,000,000  \n- Purchase20231231009: 500,000 paid, Bank Transfer -> Not cash  \n- Purchase20231231010: 3,000,000 paid, Bank Transfer -> Not cash  \n- Purchase20231231011: 800,000 paid, Cash -> Outflow: 800,000  \n- Purchase20231231012: 1,600,000 paid, Bank Transfer -> Not cash  \n- Purchase20231231013: 2,000,000 paid, Cash -> Outflow: 2,000,000  \n\nSum the cash paid purchases:\n800,000 + 500,000 + 800,000 + 2,000,000 + 800,000 + 2,000,000 = 6,900,000\n\n---\n\n#### Expenses (Cash paid operating expenses)\n\nSum all expenses marked \"Paid\" and payment_method =

outflow primarily driven by heavy cash payments to suppliers and operating expenses more than cash inflows from sales collections.",
