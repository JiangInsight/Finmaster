8,700,000 = 11,300,000  \n- Minus bank purchases: 11,300,000 - 11,900,000 = -600,000 (negative meaning bank cash outflow)  \n- Add cash sales: -600,000 + 5,160,819 = 4,560,819  \n- Add bank to cash transfers: 4,560,819 + 2,000,000 = 6,560,819  \n- Subtract cash to bank transfers: 6,560,819 - 3,300,000 = 3,260,819  \n- Subtract expenses: 3,260,819 - 1,441,063 = 1,819,756  \n\nThis represents the remaining cash and cash equivalents at end.\n\nBUT we observe that bank and cash are segregated originally, and cash purchases and expenses reduce cash, bank purchases reduce bank.\n\nThe only additions to bank cash were transfers coming back from bank.\n\nBank purchases reduce bank balance (total purchases by bank transfer: 11,900,000), and bank to cash transfer adds to cash.\n\nWe can separate:\n\nInitial bank = 15,000,000  \nMinus bank purchases: 11,900,000  \nMinus bank to cash transfers: 2,000,000 (bank reduces, cash increases)  \n= Remaining bank: 15,000,000 - 11,900,000 - 2,000,000 = 1,100,000\n\nInitial cash = 5,000,000  \nMinus cash purchases: 8,700,000 (more than initial cash means negative)  \nAdd cash sales: 5,160,819  \nAdd bank to cash transfer: 2,000,000 (already counted as bank side decrease, cash side increase)  \nMinus cash to bank transfers: 3,300,000  \nMinus expenses: 1,441,063  \n\nCalculate net cash:\n\n5,000,000  \n- 8,700,000 = -3,700,000  \n+ 5,160,819 = 1,460,819  \n+ 2,000,000 = 3,460,819  \n- 3,300,000 = 160,819  \n- 1,441,063 = -1,280,244 (negative)\n\nThis suggests cash was negative after expenses and purchases while bank has positive 1,100,000.\n\nSince cash can't be negative, the cash to bank transfers are presumably to cover cash shortages.\n\nHence total cash and cash equivalents = cash + bank = (-1,280,244) + 1,100,000 = -180,244 (which is illogical).\n\nThis indicates that all transfers and purchases were fully settled and that initially the total cash and bank were 20,000,000.\n\nThus, a better approach is:\n\nInitial cash and bank: 20,000,000 (cash 5M + bank15M)\n\nTotal cash outflows (cash purchases + cash expenses + cash to bank transfers):  \n8,700,000 + 1,441,063 + 3,300,000 = 13,441,063\n\nTotal bank outflows (bank purchases + bank to cash transfer):  \n11,900,000 + 2,000,000 = 13,900,000\n\nTotal inflows (from cash sales): 5,160,819\n\nThe cash to bank and bank to cash transfers net zero out but between cash and bank.\n\nFrom total perspective: \n\nTotal outflows = 13,441,063 + 13,900,000 = 27,341,063  \nTotal inflows = 5,160,819\n\nSo, net cash change = inflows - outflows = 5,160,819 - 27,341,063 = -22,180,244\n\nStarting from 20,000,000 initial, the cash + bank balance at end = 20,000,000 - 22,180,244 = -2,180,244\n\nA negative cash balance is impossible in reality.\n\nReconsider the purchases:\n\nMany purchases represent acquisition of fixed assets and inventory. Since fixed assets are not cash equivalents, and some purchases might be on credit.\n\nCheck \"payment/receipt_status\" for purchases:\n\nAll purchases are marked as \"Paid\" meaning cash outflow.\n\nHence these are real cash flow decreases.\n\nSimilarly, sales with payment statuses:\n\nOnly sales marked as \"Paid\" or cash receipt is cash inflow.\n\nLooking at sales, the problem data includes many sales, but only a subset is paid in cash.\n\nSince this analysis becomes very complex, and the problem is to find final **beginning** cash, i.e., initial cash and cash equivalents at start date, from problem data, the initial \"Initial20231231001\" entries for Cash deposit and Bank deposit are:\n\n- Cash deposit: 5,000,000  \n- Bank deposit: 15,000,000  \n\nTherefore, sum = 20,000,000 as beginning balance.\n\nFixed asset amount (8,000,000) is non-cash equivalent and should not be included in cash balance.\n\n**So final solution:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Beginning Balance\": \"20000000.00\"}}\n```\n\n# Summary\n\n- Initial cash + bank deposits equal beginning cash/cash equivalents in cash flow statement.  \n- Other transactions affect future periods flows.  \n- Since the problem asks for final beginning balance based on initial deposits, answer is sum of cash and bank deposits: 20,000,000.00.\n\n# Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Beginning Balance\": \"20000000.00\"}}\n```",
