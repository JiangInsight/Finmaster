Identify the initial fixed assets net value from the initial balance.\n2. Adjust for additions (purchases of fixed assets).\n3. Deduct depreciation expenses.\n4. Consider sales (disposals) of fixed assets if any.\n5. Calculate the ending fixed assets net value accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Fixed Assets Net Value\n\nFrom the initial data:\n\n- Initial Fixed Assets = 8,000,000.0\n\nThis is our fixed assets net initial value, assuming no prior accumulated depreciation is given.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine Additions (Purchases)\n\nLook for **Purchase** transactions related to fixed assets:\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: Purchase of Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit @ 800,000.0\n- Purchase20231231002: Purchase of Heavy Equipment A, 1 unit @ 500,000.0\n- Purchase20231231003: Purchase of Heavy Equipment A, 2 units @ 1,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231004: Purchase of Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit @ 800,000.0\n- Purchase20231231005: Purchase of Heavy Equipment C, 2 units @ 2,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231006: Purchase of Heavy Equipment D, 2 units @ 3,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231007: Purchase of Heavy Equipment C, 2 units @ 2,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231009: Purchase of Heavy Equipment A, 1 unit @ 500,000.0\n- Purchase20231231010: Purchase of Heavy Equipment D, 2 units @ 3,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231011: Purchase of Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit @ 800,000.0\n- Purchase20231231012: Purchase of Heavy Equipment B, 2 units @ 1,600,000.0\n- Purchase20231231013: Purchase of Heavy Equipment C, 2 units @ 2,000,000.0\n\nSumming the amounts for these purchases (we consider all as fixed asset purchases):\n\n800,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 800,000 + 2,000,000 + 3,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 500,000 + 3,000,000 + 800,000 + 1,600,000 + 2,000,000  \n= 18,000,000.0\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Consider Sales (Disposals) of Fixed Assets\n\nWe check for **Sale** transactions related to fixed assets:\n\n- Sale20240104001: Sale of Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit, sale amount 1,041,848.53, cost 800,000.0\n- Sale20240108002: Sale of Heavy Equipment C, 1 unit, sale 1,378,082.08, cost 1,000,000.0\n- Sale20240109003: Sale of Heavy Equipment C, 1 unit, sale 1,488,988.96, cost 1,000,000.0\n- Sale20240113005: Sale of Heavy Equipment A, 1 unit, sale 668,830.84, cost 500,000.0\n- Sale20240114007: Sale of Heavy Equipment A, 1 unit, sale 658,220.2, cost 500,000.0\n- Sale20240115009: Sale of Heavy Equipment D, 1 unit, sale 2,106,067.17, cost 1,500,000.0\n- Sale20240118012: Sale of Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit, sale 1,105,445.95, cost 800,000.0\n- Sale20240119014: Sale of Heavy Equipment D, 1 unit, sale 2,200,530.42, cost 1,500,000.0\n- Sale20240120015: Sale of Heavy Equipment C, 1 unit, sale 1,497,917.10, cost 1,000,000.0\n- Sale20240122018: Sale of Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit, sale 1,068,710.96, cost 800,000.0\n- Sale20240125020: Sale of Heavy Equipment C, 1 unit, sale 1,328,171.21, cost 1,000,000.0\n\nSum of cost of assets sold/disposed (to deduct from fixed assets cost basis):\n\n800,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 + 1,500,000 + 800,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,000,000 + 800,000 + 1,000,000  \n= 10,400,000.0\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Deduct Depreciation\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- Depreciation20240101001: 45,750.46\n- Depreciation20240201002: 45,748.42\n\nTotal depreciation = 45,750.46 + 45,748.42 = 91,498.88\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Ending Fixed Assets Net Value\n\nEnding fixed asset net value =  \nInitial fixed assets + Purchases - Cost of assets sold - Depreciation\n\n= 8,000,000 + 18,000,000 - 10,400,000 - 91,498.88  \n= 8,000,000 + 18,000,000 -10,491,498.88  \n= 8,000,000 + 7,508,501.12  \n= 15,508,501.12\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"fixed assets net Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"fixed assets net End Value\": \"15508501.12\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n# Summary:\n\n- Initial fixed assets net value: 8,000,000.00  \n- Total fixed assets purchased: 18,000,000.00  \n- Fixed assets cost sold: 10,400,000.00  \n- Depreciation expense: 91,498.88  \n- Ending fixed assets net value: 15,508,501.12",
