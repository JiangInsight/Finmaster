Identify the initial fixed assets value from initial records.\n2. Add any purchases or additions to fixed assets during the period.\n3. Subtract depreciation (and any disposals if given, but none are explicitly listed here) during the period.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Fixed Assets\nFrom the data, the initial fixed assets are stated explicitly as:\n\n- Initial fixed assets amount: **8,000,000.0**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Additions to Fixed Assets\n\nLook for purchases or additions related to fixed assets.\n\nWe identify purchase transactions with amounts and assets related to fixed assets as heavy equipment or similar.\n\nIn the problem data, purchase type transactions related to heavy equipment with amounts are:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 800,000.0 (Heavy Equipment B)\n- Purchase20231231002: 500,000.0 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Purchase20231231003: 1,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment A, 2 units but total amount is 1,000,000)\n- Purchase20231231004: 800,000.0 (Heavy Equipment B)\n- Purchase20231231005: 2,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment C)\n- Purchase20231231007: 800,000.0 (Heavy Equipment B)\n- Purchase20231231008: 2,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment C)\n- Purchase20231231010: 3,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment D)\n- Purchase20231231011: 800,000.0 (Heavy Equipment B)\n- Purchase20231231012: 1,600,000.0 (Heavy Equipment B)\n- Purchase20231231013: 2,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment C)\n\nSum all these purchase amounts:\n\n800,000  \n+ 500,000  \n+ 1,000,000  \n+ 800,000  \n+ 2,000,000  \n+ 800,000  \n+ 2,000,000  \n+ 3,000,000  \n+ 800,000  \n+ 1,600,000  \n+ 2,000,000  \n= ?\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n800,000 + 500,000 = 1,300,000  \n1,300,000 + 1,000,000 = 2,300,000  \n2,300,000 + 800,000 = 3,100,000  \n3,100,000 + 2,000,000 = 5,100,000  \n5,100,000 + 800,000 = 5,900,000  \n5,900,000 + 2,000,000 = 7,900,000  \n7,900,000 + 3,000,000 = 10,900,000  \n10,900,000 + 800,000 = 11,700,000  \n11,700,000 + 1,600,000 = 13,300,000  \n13,300,000 + 2,000,000 = 15,300,000\n\nTotal additions = 15,300,000.0\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Subtract Depreciation\n\nDepreciation amounts in the data:\n\n- Depreciation20240101001: 45,750.46  \n- Depreciation20240201002: 45,748.42\n\nTotal depreciation: 45,750.46 + 45,748.42 = 91,498.88\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Ending Fixed Assets Value\n\nEnding Fixed Assets = Initial Fixed Assets + Additions - Depreciation  \n= 8,000,000 + 15,300,000 - 91,498.88 = 23,208,501.12\n\n---\n\n### Final Result\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"23208501.12\"}}\n```",
