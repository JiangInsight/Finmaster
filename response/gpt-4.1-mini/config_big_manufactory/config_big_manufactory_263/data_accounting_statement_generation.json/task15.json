Thus:\n\n**Total Liabilities Initial Value = 0.00**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Identify Liabilities from Purchases (and their payment statuses) to determine ending liabilities\n\nLook for purchases where payment/receipt status is **Unpaid**, or payment method is **Account Payable** indicating liability outstanding.\n\nFrom the given data (key entries for purchases):\n\n| id            | amount      | payment/receipt_status | payment_method     |  \n|---------------|-------------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | 800,000   | Paid                  | Cash               | Paid, so no liability  \n| Purchase20231231003 | 1,000,000 | Paid                  | Bank Transfer      | Paid, no liability  \n| Purchase20231231004 | 800,000   | Paid                  | Cash               | Paid, no liability  \n| Purchase20231231005 | 2,000,000 | Paid                  | Bank Transfer      | Paid, no liability  \n| Purchase20231231006 | 3,000,000 | Paid                  | Bank Transfer      | Paid, no liability  \n| Purchase20231231007 | 800,000   | Paid                  | Bank Transfer      | Paid, no liability  \n| Purchase20231231008 | 2,000,000 | Paid                  | Cash               | Paid, no liability  \n| Purchase20231231009 | 500,000   | Paid                  | Bank Transfer      | Paid, no liability  \n| Purchase20231231010 | 3,000,000 | Paid                  | Bank Transfer      | Paid, no liability  \n| Purchase20231231011 | 800,000   | Paid                  | Cash               | Paid, no liability  \n| Purchase20231231012 | 1,600,000 | Paid                  | Bank Transfer      | Paid, no liability  \n| Purchase20231231013 | 2,000,000 | Paid                  | Cash               | Paid, no liability  \n\nNo unpaid purchases are listed, so no immediate liabilities here.\n\nAre there any unpaid purchases? None explicitly shown.\n\nAre there other liabilities?\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Look for unpaid amounts or specific \"Account Payable\" statuses\n\nThe purchased data has no unpaid entries, so no liabilities from there.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Cross-check Interest or other obligations?\n\nInterest Receivables are listed as unpaid, but Interest Receivable is an asset (not a liability).\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Check if there are any other liabilities like unpaid expenses or other\n\nNo other explicit liabilities such as loans, payables, or unpaid purchases.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: From the example and prior data, since no unpaid purchases or payable amount is indicated, the total liabilities remain zero.\n\n---\n\n### Result:\n\n- Initial liabilities: 0.00 (no liabilities at start)\n- Ending liabilities: 0.00 (no unpaid or payable liabilities at end)\n\n---\n\n### Final Output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', 'Total Liabilities End Value': '0.00'}}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Note:** This conclusion is based purely on the provided dataset, which shows no unpaid purchase or account payable entries indicating liabilities. All purchases are marked as \"Paid\".",
