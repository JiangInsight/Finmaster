From the **Balance Sheet**:  \n   - The line \"Taxes Payable\" shows an end amount of 727140.68, which indicates the tax liability (taxes expected to be paid).\n\n2. From the **Income Statement**:  \n   - The line \"Tax Expense\" is 727140.68, representing the tax charge for the period.\n\n3. From the **Cash Flow Statement**:  \n   - The line \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" shows 727140.68, consistent with tax payable movement.\n\nAll these point to the total tax amount of 727,140.68 expected to be paid by the entity.\n\nThus, the value of total tax the entity is expected to pay (or recover if negative, but here it's positive) is **727140.68**.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"727140.68\"}}\n```",
