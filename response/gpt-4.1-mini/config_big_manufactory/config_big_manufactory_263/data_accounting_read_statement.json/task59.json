The amount of interest accrued but not yet received (usually represented as \"Interest Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet or related line items in other statements).\n2. The net addition (net increase) in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period (usually found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Net Increase\" or equivalent).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Find \"Interest Receivable\" or \"Interest Income\"\n\n- In **Balance Sheet**, the line item is labeled \"Interest Receivable\" with the ending amount on 2024-02-05 as **20559.00**.\n- In **Income Statement**, \"Interest Income\" is 20559.00 (matches).\n- In **Cash Flow**, there is a line \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" with amount -20559.00, indicating the change in interest receivable (which is consistent with the balance sheet).\n\nThe value for interest accrued but not yet received is the Balance Sheet ending amount: **20559.00**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find net addition in cash and cash equivalents\n\n- In the **Cash Flow Statement**, under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents,\" the net increase is **-17417367.15** on 2024-02-05.\n- This represents the net addition (negative, so a decrease) in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n- value1 (interest accrued but not yet received) = 20559.00  \n- value2 (net addition in cash and cash equivalents) = -17417367.15\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"20559.00\", \"value2\": \"-17417367.15\"}}\n```",
