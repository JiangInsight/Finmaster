                        "content": "To solve the task, we need to identify three specific line items and their end values or amounts from the given financial statements:\n\n1. Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense (Income Statement)\n2. The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period (Balance Sheet - Accounts Payable change)\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares (Balance Sheet - Paid-in Capital)\n\nLet's go step by step:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify profit or loss before tax (Income Statement)\n- The line \"Profit Before Tax\" shows the profit or loss before tax.\n- From the income statement:  \n  **Profit Before Tax = 1133140.32**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify addition in amount owed for goods/services on credit (Accounts Payable)\n- This corresponds to the change in \"Accounts Payable\" on the balance sheet.\n- The initial Accounts Payable is 0.00 (2023-12-31)\n- The ending Accounts Payable is 0.00 (2024-02-05)\n- The addition in amount owed is therefore: 0.00 - 0.00 = 0.00  \n- So, the addition in accounts payable is **0.00**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Identify capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares (Paid-in Capital)\n- On balance sheet, the \"Paid-in Capital\" shows:\n- Initial amount: 28000000.00 (2023-12-31)\n- Ending amount: 28000000.00 (2024-02-05)\n- Since no change is indicated, the capital contributed is **28000000.00**\n\n---\n\n### Summary of answers:\n- Balance Sheet:\n  - Addition in Accounts Payable = 0.00\n  - Paid-in Capital = 28000000.00\n- Income Statement:\n  - Profit Before Tax = 1133140.32\n\nThe problem requests the output grouped by financial statement in this order:\n1. Balance Sheet items (accounts payable addition and paid-in capital)\n2. Income Statement item (profit before tax)\n\nIn the example and instructions, the order is:  \n- value1: Capital contributed by shareholders (Paid-in Capital)  \n- value2: Profit or loss before tax (Profit Before Tax)  \n- value3: Addition in amount owed (Accounts Payable)\n\nBut in the example, value1 corresponds to Paid-in Capital, value2 to Profit Before Tax, and value3 to addition to Accounts Payable.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- value1 = Paid-in Capital = 28000000.00  \n- value2 = Profit Before Tax = 1133140.32  \n- value3 = Addition to Accounts Payable = 0.00\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"28000000.00\", \"value2\": \"1133140.32\", \"value3\": \"0.00\"} }\n```",
