Identify the revenue:\n   - Main Business Revenue = 14,542,813.42\n   - Total Revenue = 14,542,813.42\n\n2. Identify the cost:\n   - Cost of Goods Sold = 10,400,000.00\n   - Total Cost = 10,400,000.00\n\n3. Calculate the difference between revenue and cost:\n   - Difference = Total Revenue - Total Cost\n   - Difference = 14,542,813.42 - 10,400,000.00 = 4,142,813.42\n\n4. This difference corresponds to the Gross Profit line, which is given as 4,142,813.42.\n\nThus, the value of difference between revenue and cost is 4,142,813.42.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"4142813.42\"}}\n```",
