Costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services to customers typically correspond to \"Selling Expenses.\"  \n   From the problem: Selling Expenses = 963185.37\n\n2. Financing costs incurred to raise funds needed for production and operation correspond to \"Financial Expenses.\"  \n   From the problem: Financial Expenses = 559176.01\n\n3. The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life corresponds to \"Depreciation.\"  \n   From the problem: Depreciation = 91498.88\n\n4. The total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period corresponds to \"Tax Expense.\"  \n   From the problem: Tax Expense = 727140.68\n\nSo the values matching the line items in the same order as asked:\n\n- costs incurred to secure customer orders/deliver goods (Selling Expenses): 963185.37  \n- depreciation: 91498.88  \n- financing costs (Financial Expenses): 559176.01  \n- taxes (Tax Expense): 727140.68\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"963185.37\", \"value2\": \"91498.88\", \"value3\": \"559176.01\", \"value4\": \"727140.68\"}}\n```",
