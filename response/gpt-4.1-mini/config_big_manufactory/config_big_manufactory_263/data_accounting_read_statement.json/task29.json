Identify the total income arising in the course of ordinary activities.  \nIn the income statement, \"Total Revenue\" is the total income from ordinary activities. The value is 14,542,813.42.\n\n2. Identify its constituent line items from the income statement.  \nFrom the statement, \"Main Business Revenue\" equals Total Revenue and has the same value: 14,542,813.42.\n\n3. Decompose this total income into 1 component sub-item that also originates from the input statement, along with initial and final values.  \nHere there's only one sub-item under Total Revenue, which is \"Main Business Revenue\" with the same initial and final value of 14,542,813.42.\n\nTherefore, the solution JSON will be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"14542813.42\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"14542813.42\"}}\n```",
