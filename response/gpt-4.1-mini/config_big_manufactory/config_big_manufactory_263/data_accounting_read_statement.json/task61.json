The cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\nWe must look in the financial statements and find the relevant line items for these two values.\n\n---\n\nStep 1: Identify cost incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services.\n\n- These costs are typically recognized as:\n  - Selling Expenses (often related to delivering goods and securing orders)\n  - Administrative Expenses (sometimes related, but primarily internal costs)\n  \nFrom the income statement, the relevant line item likely is the **Selling Expenses**.\n\nFrom the problem's income statement:\n\n| Account             | Amount    | Date       |\n|---------------------|-----------|------------|\n| Selling Expenses    | 963,185.37 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nTherefore,\n\n- Cost to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services = **963185.37**\n\n---\n\nStep 2: Identify cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\n- This information is typically found in the **Cash Flow Statement** under **Cash Flow from Investing Activities**.\n- The line item usually called \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" or similar shows cash outflows for acquiring long-term assets.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n\n| Account                  | Amount  | Date       |\n|--------------------------|---------|------------|\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets | 0.00    | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThe amount is zero, meaning no cash was paid for property, plant and equipment acquisition during this period.\n\n---\n\nStep 3: Output formatting\n\nPer instructions, group by financial statement in order:\n\n1. Balance Sheet - no relevant line items for these particular values here.\n2. Income Statement - Selling Expenses = 963185.37\n3. Cash Flow Statement - Purchase of Fixed Assets = 0.00\n\n---\n\nFinal solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"963185.37\", \"value2\": \"0.00\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- value1 = Selling Expenses (cost to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services)\n- value2 = Purchase of Fixed Assets (cash payment for property, plant & equipment)",
