Look under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" for relevant line items indicating purchases or payments toward property, plant, and equipment (PPE) or other long-term assets.\n2. In the problem, under Investing Activities, we have a line called \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n3. The amount for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is 0.00.\n4. This directly matches the line item related to acquisition of property, plant and equipment (PPE) and other long-term assets.\n\nTherefore, the relevant value is \"0.00\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
