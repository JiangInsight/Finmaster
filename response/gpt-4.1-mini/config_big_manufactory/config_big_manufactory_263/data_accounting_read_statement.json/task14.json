These are generally referred to as \"Current Liabilities.\"\n\nLooking at the problem data, the relevant lines for current liabilities are:\n\n- Accounts Payable: Initially 0.00, End 0.00\n- Taxes Payable: Initially 0.00, End 727140.68\n- Total Current Liabilities: Initially 0.00, End 727140.68\n\nSince \"Total Current Liabilities\" already aggregates the liabilities expected to be settled within the operating cycle, this is the value we need.\n\nSo the solution is:\n\nInitial value: 0.00  \nEnd value: 727140.68\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"727140.68\"}}\n```",
