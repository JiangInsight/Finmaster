The four specific line items requested are:\n   - The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life: This corresponds to **Depreciation**.\n   - Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period: This corresponds to changes in **Inventory** (as inventory represents assets held for sale or in production).\n   - Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends: This corresponds to **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**.\n   - Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period: This corresponds to **Net Increase** in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n2. From the problem data:\n   - Depreciation: 91498.88\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Inventory: -8400000.00\n   - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -0.00\n   - Net Increase in cash and cash equivalents: -17417367.15\n\n3.
