Common expense-related accounts from the given data can include \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" as depreciation is an expense shown in the profit or loss statement.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n- \"Accumulated Depreciation\" starts at 0.00 on 2023-12-31 and increases to 91498.88 on 2024-02-05.\n- This increase represents the depreciation expense charged during the period.\n- No other direct expense line is clearly indicated in the balance sheet data provided.\n\nHence, the initial value of depreciation expense is 0.00, and the final value (accumulated) is 91498.88.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"91498.88\"}}\n```",
