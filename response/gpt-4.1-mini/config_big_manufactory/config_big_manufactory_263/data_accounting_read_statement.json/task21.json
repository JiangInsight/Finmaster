The question asks to identify and extract the specific line items and value of income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities.\n2. Core operating activities generally include revenue from main business activities, such as \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n3. From the income statement provided, the two relevant line items representing income from core operations are:\n   - Main Business Revenue: 14,542,813.42\n   - Total Revenue: 14,542,813.42\n4. Since both amounts are equal, it is simplest to select \"Main Business Revenue\" as the income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities.\n\nHence, the value to be extracted is 14,542,813.42.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"14542813.42\"} }\n```",
