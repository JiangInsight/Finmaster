While \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is related to delivery, it mostly reflects production or procurement cost, not the delivery process per se.\n- Generally, \"Selling Expenses\" are the primary line item representing the cost to secure orders and deliver to customers (e.g., sales staff expenses, delivery, shipping, and distribution).\n\nGiven the example and the prior logic, the best matching value to the task is the \"Selling Expenses\" amount.\n\nFrom the data:\n\n| Account           | Amount      |\n|-------------------|-------------|\n| Selling Expenses  | 963185.37   |\n\nTherefore, the solution value is 963185.37.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"963185.37\"}}\n```",
