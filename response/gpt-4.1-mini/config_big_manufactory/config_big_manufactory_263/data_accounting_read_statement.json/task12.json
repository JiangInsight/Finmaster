This typically refers to current assets, which are listed as \"Total Current Assets\" in the balance sheet.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify line items related to total assets for the normal operating cycle.\n   - These are current assets such as Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, Accounts Receivable, Inventory.\n   - The sum of these is usually represented by \"Total Current Assets.\"\n\n2. Extract the initial and ending values of \"Total Current Assets\":\n   - Initial amount (2023-12-31): 20,000,000.00\n   - End amount (2024-02-05): 21,224,639.20\n\nThese values represent the total assets expected to be realized or consumed in the normal operating cycle.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"20000000.00\", \"end value\": \"21224639.20\"}}\n```",
