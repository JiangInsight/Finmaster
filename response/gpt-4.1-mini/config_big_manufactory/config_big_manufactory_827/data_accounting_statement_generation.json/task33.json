Sale20240103001 | tax_amount: 56320.16\n2. Sale20240106004 | tax_amount: 34227.94\n3. Sale20240107005 | tax_amount: 67705.31\n4. Sale20240108008 | tax_amount: 54095.51\n5. Sale20240109009 | tax_amount: 103524.98\n6. Sale20240111011 | tax_amount: 110752.24\n7. Sale20240122024 | tax_amount: 32625.45\n8. Sale20240124028 | tax_amount: 36846.43\n9. Sale20240125030 | tax_amount: 65921.12\n10. Sale20240129034 | tax_amount: 97616.11\n11. Sale20240205042 | tax_amount: 107208.81\n12. Sale20240117017 | tax_amount: 35150.46\n13. Sale20240122024 (already counted)\n14. Sale20240131038 | tax_amount: 101127.37\n\nNote: Sale20240122024 appeared twice in the list; only count once.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Sum tax amounts from all sales (unique records)\n\nAdding these tax amounts:\n\n- 56320.16  \n- 34227.94  \n- 67705.31  \n- 54095.51  \n- 103524.98  \n- 110752.24  \n- 32625.45  \n- 36846.43  \n- 65921.12  \n- 97616.11  \n- 107208.81  \n- 35150.46  \n- 101127.37  \n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\nStart: 0  \n+56320.16 = 56320.16  \n+34227.94 = 90548.10  \n+67705.31 = 158253.41  \n+54095.51 = 212348.92  \n+103524.98 = 315873.90  \n+110752.24 = 426626.14  \n+32625.45 = 459251.59  \n+36846.43 = 496098.02  \n+65921.12 = 562019.14  \n+97616.11 = 659635.25  \n+107208.81 = 766844.06  \n+35150.46 = 801994.52  \n+101127.37 = 903121.89\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Verify if any other lines relate to tax expense\n\n- Expense, Financial, Administrative Expenses, Depreciation, Interest Receivables do not indicate tax.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nThe total tax expense (sum of tax amounts from sales) is **903121.89**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer in required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Tax Expense\": \"903121.89\"}}\n```\n",
