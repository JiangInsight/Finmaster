Identify the opening and closing balances of accounts receivable.\n2. Compute the change: Closing balance - Opening balance.\n3. Report the result as (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable.  \n   - An increase in accounts receivable is a use of cash (negative effect, so reported as negative value).\n   - A decrease in accounts receivable is a source of cash (positive effect).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Opening balance of accounts receivable (at 2023-12-31)\n- There is no explicit accounts receivable line for opening.\n- But initial fixed assets and cash and bank deposits are given, no initial accounts receivable explicitly.\n- For receivable related amounts, the initial record is not listed, so assume opening AR at 2023-12-31 = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Compute closing accounts receivable at 2024-02-05\n\nAccounts receivable arises from sales with \"payment/receipt_status\" = \"Unpaid\" and \"receive_method\" = \"Account Receviable\".\n\nWe sum all unpaid sales amounts (plus interest receivables with unpaid status if considered receivables) at or before 2024-02-05.\n\n- Identify all sales entries with:\n  - payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\"\n  - receive_method = \"Account Receviable\"\n\nSum their amounts.\n\nFurthermore, there are \"Interest Receivables\" entries with unpaid status, but usually, they are separate interest receivables, can be excluded for main accounts receivable balance unless otherwise specified.\n\n---\n\n### Find unpaid sales with account receivable method and sum their amounts:\n\nGoing through the listed data (filter):\n\n- Sale20240103001 (2024-01-03): amount=1,126,403.16 unpaid, Account Receviable\n- Sale20240108008 (2024-01-08): amount=1,081,910.15 unpaid, Account Receviable\n- Sale20240109009 (2024-01-09): amount=2,070,499.57 unpaid, Account Receviable\n- Sale20240111011 (2024-01-11): amount=2,215,044.89 unpaid, Account Receviable\n- Sale20240124028 (2024-01-24): no unpaid, this one is paid?
