                        "content": "To calculate the \"Taxes Payable\" in the balance sheet including both the initial and final amounts, we should:\n\n1. Identify the initial amount at the start date (2023-12-31) - these are usually entries marked as initial balances (type includes \"Initial\") and specifically related to taxes payable. In the given dataset, the initial tax payable is not explicitly stated, so initial taxes payable is assumed to be zero unless indicated.\n\n2. Calculate the taxes payable from the transactions between the initial and final date (covering January and early February 2024). Generally, taxes payable relate to tax amounts from sales minus applicable tax refunds or payments.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Taxes Payable**\n\n- There is no explicit tax payable amount listed at the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n- Hence, initial taxes payable = 0.00\n\n**Step 2: Taxes Payable End Value Calculation**\n\nWe find all the tax amounts that should be accrued as taxes payable by the end of the period.\n\n- Tax payable typically comes from tax_amount on sales that are unpaid (account receivable status not paid) - i.e., taxes collected but not yet remitted.\n- The tax_amount field provides the tax component of sales.\n- We should sum all tax_amount fields from sales where tax is to be paid and exists.\n\nFrom the problem data:\n\n- We review the \"Sale\" transactions and their tax_amount fields.\n\nLet's sum all tax_amount across all sales:\n\n- Sale20240103001: 56320.16\n- Sale20240106004: 34227.94\n- Sale20240107005: 67705.31\n- Sale20240108008: 54095.51\n- Sale20240109009: 103524.98\n- Sale20240111011: 110752.24\n- Sale20240122024: 32625.45\n- Sale20240124028: 36846.43\n- Sale20240125030: 65921.12\n- Sale20240129034: 97616.11\n- Sale20240205042: 107208.81\n- Sale20240117017: 35150.46\n- Sale20240131038: 101127.37\n\nSum these tax_amount values:\n\n56320.16 + 34227.94 + 67705.31 + 54095.51 + 103524.98 + 110752.24 + 32625.45 + 36846.43 + 65921.12 + 97616.11 + 107208.81 + 35150.46 + 101127.37\n\nCalculating stepwise:\n\n- 56320.16 + 34227.94 = 90548.10\n- 90548.10 + 67705.31 = 158253.41\n- 158253.41 + 54095.51 = 212348.92\n- 212348.92 + 103524.98 = 315873.90\n- 315873.90 + 110752.24 = 426626.14\n- 426626.14 + 32625.45 = 459251.59\n- 459251.59 + 36846.43 = 496098.02\n- 496098.02 + 65921.12 = 562019.14\n- 562019.14 + 97616.11 = 659635.25\n- 659635.25 + 107208.81 = 766844.06\n- 766844.06 + 35150.46 = 801994.52\n- 801994.52 + 101127.37 = 903121.89\n\nThus total tax_amount from sales is approximately 903121.89\n\nHowever, not all sales tax amounts correspond to \"taxes payable\" as some sales are paid or unpaid.\n\nBut task instructions indicate calculating the taxes payable for balance sheet, which is typically the taxes accrued but unpaid.\n\nSince we don't have explicit payment status for the tax, we'll assume the total tax amounts on sales represent taxes payable currently accrued.\n\n**Step 3: Adjust taxes payable by any tax payments or tax related expense**\n\nNo direct tax payments are shown in Expenses or other transactions.\n\nHence, the total taxes payable end value is the sum of sales tax_amount, i.e., 903121.89\n\n**Therefore, the solutions:**\n\n- Taxes Payable Initial Value: 0.00 (no initial taxes payable at 2023-12-31)\n- Taxes Payable End Value: 903121.89\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"903121.89\"}}\n```",
