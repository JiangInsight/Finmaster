The inventory changes typically come from Purchase and Sale transactions related to inventory/product items, excluding fixed assets and others.\n\n**Step 1: Identify inventory relevant transactions and their costs**\n\nFrom the dataset, the product items related are Heavy Equipment A, B, C, D. These are likely inventory items.\n\nWe consider all Purchase transactions for these products:\n- Purchase transactions add to inventory (increase inventory)\n- Sale transactions reduce inventory (decrease inventory)\n\n**Step 2: Sum of purchases**\n\nExtract all Purchases related to products (exclude assets, expenses, etc.).
