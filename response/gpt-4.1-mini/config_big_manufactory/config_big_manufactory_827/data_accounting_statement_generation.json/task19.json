The purchases with unpaid status add liabilities (accounts payable), purchases paid decrease cash or bank but do not affect total liabilities + owners equity directly (as assets convert to fixed assets or inventory, but total remains).\n\nNo direct owner's equity injections or dividends are mentioned, but profits increase owners equity, and losses decrease it.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Calculate final balances**\n\nWe track the impact on liabilities and owners equity:\n\n- Initial Total Liabilities and Owners Equity: 28,000,000\n\n- Purchases marked Unpaid: Increase Liabilities (Account Payable)\n\nThere is one unpaid purchase in the data:\n\n| id               | amount    | payment/receipt_status | \n|------------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| Purchase20231231011 | 1,000,000 | Unpaid (Account Payable) |\n\nSo, liabilities increase by 1,000,000.\n\n- Sales generate profits which increase owner's equity:\n\nCalculate net profit during the period:\n\nSum up profits from sales (column 'profit') for all sales.\n\nFrom sales entries in data:\n\n| Sale id          | profit          |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Sale20240103001  | 326,403.16      |\n| Sale20240106004  | 184,558.74      |\n| Sale20240107005  | 354,106.17      |\n| Sale20240111011  | 715,044.89      |\n| Sale20240122024  | 152,509.01      |\n| Sale20240125030  | 318,422.35      |\n| Sale20240129034  | 452,322.13      |\n| Sale20240205042  | 644,176.18      |\n| Sale20240117017  | 203,009.17      |\n\nSum profits:\n\n326,403.16 + 184,558.74 + 354,106.17 + 715,044.89 + 152,509.01 + 318,422.35 + 452,322.13 + 644,176.18 + 203,009.17 \n= \n\nCalculating:\n\n326,403.16\n+ 184,558.74 = 510,961.9\n+ 354,106.17 = 865,068.07\n+ 715,044.89 = 1,580,112.96\n+ 152,509.01 = 1,732,621.97\n+ 318,422.35 = 2,051,044.32\n+ 452,322.13 = 2,503,366.45\n+ 644,176.18 = 3,147,542.63\n+ 203,009.17 = 3,350,551.8\n\nTotal Profit = 3,350,551.8\n\n- Expenses decrease owners equity (administrative, sales, financial expenses)\n\nSum of expenses (Administrative, Sales, Financial):\n\nSum the amount for all expense transactions.\n\nThe expense amounts:\n\n| id               | amount     |\n|------------------|------------|\n| Expense20240101001 | 31,077.04  |\n| Expense20240102001 | 72,434.17  |\n| Expense20240103001 | 41,635.89 + 73,422.33 = 115,058.22 |\n| Expense20240104001 | 88,194.75 + 57,286.12 = 145,480.87 |\n| Expense20240105001 | 52,101.64  |\n| Expense20240106001 | 19,433.8   |\n| Expense20240107001 | 50,312.93 + 18,529.12 = 68,842.05 |\n| Expense20240108001 | 72,933.8 + 91,530.52 = 164,464.32 |\n| Expense20240109001 | 49,974.11  |\n| Expense20240110001 | 23,835.49  |\n| Expense20240111001 | 10,656.44 + 79,175.3 = 89,831.74 |\n| Expense20240112001 | 39,503.53 + 52,410.28 = 91,913.81 |\n| Expense20240113001 | 83,043.95 + 64,480.99 = 147,524.94 |\n| Expense20240114001 | 30,521.87  |\n| Expense20240115001 | 65,687.23  |\n| Expense20240116001 | 32,249.23 + 94,406.29 = 126,655.52 |\n| Expense20240118001 | 42,974.21  |\n| Expense20240119001 | 81,067.73 + 25,941.18 = 107,008.91 |\n| Expense20240120001 | 21,329.49  |\n| Expense20240121001 | 85,787.82 + 78,068.15 = 163,855.97 |\n| Expense20240122001 | 20,961.18 + 11,973.24 = 32,934.42 |\n| Expense20240123001 | 79,415.78 + 29,336.31 = 108,752.09 |\n| Expense20240124001 | 20,565.7   |\n| Expense20240125001 | 16,489.93 + 60,656.12 = 77,146.05 |\n| Expense20240126001 | 79,494.6   |\n| Expense20240129001 | 14,158.49 + 72,125.7 = 86,284.19 |\n| Expense20240130001 | 45,589.58 + 68,047.29 = 113,636.87 |\n\nNow sum these expenses:\n\n31,077.04\n+ 72,434.17 = 103,511.21\n+ 115,058.22 = 218,569.43\n+ 145,480.87 = 364,050.30\n+ 52,101.64 = 416,151.94\n+ 19,433.8 = 435,585.74\n+ 68,842.05 = 504,427.79\n+ 164,464.32 = 668,892.11\n+ 49,974.11 = 718,866.22\n+ 23,835.49 = 742,701.71\n+ 89,831.74 = 832,533.45\n+ 91,913.81 = 924,447.26\n+ 147,524.94 = 1,071,972.20\n+ 30,521.87 = 1,102,494.07\n+ 65,687.23 = 1,168,181.30\n+ 126,655.52 = 1,294,836.82\n+ 42,974.21 = 1,337,811.03\n+ 107,008.91 = 1,444,819.94\n+ 21,329.49 = 1,466,149.43\n+ 163,855.97 = 1,630,005.40\n+ 32,934.42 = 1,662,939.82\n+ 108,752.09 = 1,771,691.91\n+ 20,565.7 = 1,792,257.61\n+ 77,146.05 = 1,869,403.66\n+ 79,494.6 = 1,948,898.26\n+ 86,284.19 = 2,035,182.45\n+ 113,636.87 = 2,148,819.32\n\nTotal Expenses = 2,148,819.32\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Calculate net change in owners equity**\n\nNet profit minus expenses:\n\n3,350,551.8 -
