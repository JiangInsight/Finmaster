                        "content": "To calculate the net cash flow from investing activities, we consider cash inflows and outflows relating to the purchase and sale of fixed assets or other long-term assets.\n\nStep 1: Identify transactions related to investing activities:\n\n- Fixed Assets Purchase (cash outflows)\n- Sale of Fixed Assets (cash inflows, if any)\n- Here, there is no explicit sale of fixed assets above, only purchase, so only purchase (cash outflow) is considered.\n\nStep 2: Extract all paid fixed asset purchases (only those marked as \"Paid\" and involving Fixed Assets or Fixed Assets Purchase):\n\nFrom the given data (focusing on \"FixedAsset\" or similar):\n\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | Paid | 871,751.87 | payment_method: Bank Transfer\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | Paid | 1,046,775.17 | payment_method: Bank Transfer\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | Paid | 577,494.56 | payment_method: Bank Transfer\n\nAlso initial \"Fixed Assets\" entry at 8,000,000 is a beginning balance, that is not a cash flow in the period.\n\nAdditionally, any other purchases related to assets? They are \"Purchase\" type but no indication these are fixed assets outside the FixedAssetPurchase entries. So only these 3 fixed asset purchases are considered.\n\nStep 3: Sum the cash outflows for fixed assets:\n\nInvestment outflows:\n- 871,751.87\n- 1,046,775.17\n- 577,494.56\n\nSum = 871,751.87 + 1,046,775.17 + 577,494.56 = 2,495,821.60 (approx)\n\nStep 4: Check for any sale or disposal of fixed assets (cash inflow):\n\nThe data shows no sale or disposal of fixed assets (no cash inflow related to asset sale). The \"Sale\" entries are product sales, not fixed assets.\n\nStep 5: Net cash flow from investing activities = Cash Inflows from sale of fixed assets - Cash outflows for purchase of fixed assets\n\nSince no sale, net cash flow is just negative of total purchase.\n\nResult: -2,495,821.60\n\nExpressed to two decimals: -2,495,821.60\n\nThus:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-2495821.60\"}}\n```\n\n# Final answer:\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-2495821.60\"}}",
