The amount for \"interest accrued but not yet received,\" which corresponds to the line item related to interest receivable.\n2. The net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period, which should be found in the cash flow statement under cash and cash equivalents (usually labeled \"Net Increase\" or similar).\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Find the interest accrued but not received**\n\n- From the **Balance Sheet**, the line item \"Interest Receivable\" has an end amount of **13555.89**.\n- From the **Income Statement**, the \"Interest Income\" matches this value as **13555.89**.\n- From the **Cash Flow Statement**, the change in interest receivable is listed as \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable | -13555.89\".\n\nThe task asks to identify the \"amounts of interest accrued but not yet received,\" which is the end balance of \"Interest Receivable\" from the Balance Sheet, so the value is **13555.89**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**\n\n- In the **Cash Flow Statement**, under Cash and Cash Equivalents section, the row is labeled \"Net Increase.\"\n- The value given is **-15854422.42**, indicating a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nTherefore, the net addition (which can be positive or negative) is **-15854422.42**.\n\n---\n\n**Final formatting:**\n\nGrouping by financial statement per instructions:\n\n1. Balance Sheet: Interest Receivable end value: 13555.89\n2. Income Statement: (not needed for output as it duplicates interest receivable)\n3. Cash Flow Statement: Net increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents: -15854422.42\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"13555.89\", \"value2\": \"-15854422.42\"}}\n```",
