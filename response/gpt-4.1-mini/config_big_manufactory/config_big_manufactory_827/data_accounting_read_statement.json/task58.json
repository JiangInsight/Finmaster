The financial data includes balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement tables.\n2. The \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" values are typically reported in the cash flow statement section, under beginning and ending balances.\n3. In the \"cash flow\" section, under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents,\" the \"Beginning Balance\" is provided as 20000000.00 (date 2024-02-05).\n4. This matches the \"Total Current Assets\" opening balance on the balance sheet on 2023-12-31 (20,000,000.00), which consists primarily of cash on hand and bank deposits.\n5. Therefore, the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period are 20,000,000.00.\n\nHence, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"20000000.00\"}}\n```",
