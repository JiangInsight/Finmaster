                        "content": "To solve the task, we need to find:\n\n1. The cost incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services to customers.  \n   - Typically, these costs are administrative expenses and selling expenses shown in the income statement.\n   - Between these, selling expenses often represent the costs to deliver goods and services (selling and distribution costs).\n   - Administrative expenses may include order-related costs as well.\n   - The task example picked the \"Selling Expenses\" value as the cost incurred to secure orders and deliver goods/services.\n\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment, and other long-term assets.  \n   - This is typically the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" or similar line item in the cash flow statement under investing activities.\n\nFrom the provided financial statements:\n\n- Income Statement:  \n  Selling Expenses = 1,468,071.54  \n  Administrative Expenses = 863,669.20  \n\nThe reasonable cost to secure orders and deliver goods would be \"Selling Expenses\": 1,468,071.54.\n\n- Cash Flow Statement:  \n  Purchase of Fixed Assets = 2,496,021.60\n\nThus:  \n- value1: Selling Expenses = \"1468071.54\"  \n- value2: Purchase of Fixed Assets = \"2496021.60\"\n\nNo relevant line items related to these costs appear in the balance sheet.\n\nHence, group by statements:\n\n1. Balance Sheet: No relevant line items to extract.\n\n2. Income Statement: Selling Expenses = 1468071.54\n\n3. Cash Flow Statement: Purchase of Fixed Assets = 2496021.60\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"1468071.54\", \"value2\": \"2496021.60\"}}\n```\n\nThis matches the task request.",
