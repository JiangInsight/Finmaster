Here it is:  \n  \"Bank Deposits\" with an \"End_amount\" of 1103978.40.\n\nStep 2: Identify the line item for income earned by an entity from financial assets.  \n- In the Income Statement, typically this is \"Interest Income\".  \n- Here, \"Interest Income\" has an amount of 13555.89.\n\nStep 3: Confirm no other relevant lines in the Cash Flow Statement relate explicitly to funds deposit into bank or income earned.\n\nStep 4: Structure answer as per instructions: group by financial statement in order - Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement.\n\nFinal values:  \n- value1 (funds deposit into bank): 1103978.40  \n- value2 (income earned from financial assets): 13555.89\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"1103978.40\", \"value2\": \"13555.89\"}}\n```",
