The problem requires extracting four specific values from the cash flow statement:\n\n   - **Value 1:** Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life → usually labeled \"Depreciation.\"\n   - **Value 2:** Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured → here it corresponds to \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory.\"\n   - **Value 3:** Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments → generally from investing activities, typically labeled \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\"\n   - **Value 4:** Net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period → usually labeled \"Net Increase\" under Cash and Cash Equivalents.\n\n2. Locate these line items in the input:\n\n   - Depreciation: 138957.79\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Inventory: -6100000.00\n   - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -2496021.60\n   - Net Increase (in Cash and Cash Equivalents): -15854422.42\n\n3. Output the values as strings carrying the exact amounts.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '138957.79', 'value2': '-6100000.00', 'value3': '-2496021.60', 'value4': '-15854422.42'}}\n```",
