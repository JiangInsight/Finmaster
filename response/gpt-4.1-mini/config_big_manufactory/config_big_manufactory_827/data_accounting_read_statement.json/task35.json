Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers:  \n   This corresponds typically to \"Selling Expenses\".\n\n2. The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life:  \n   This corresponds to \"Depreciation\".\n\n3. Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation:  \n   This corresponds to \"Financial Expenses\".\n\n4. Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period:  \n   This corresponds to \"Tax Expense\".\n\nFrom the problem input, the respective values are:\n\n- Selling Expenses: 1468071.54  \n- Depreciation: 138957.79  \n- Financial Expenses: 351260.94  \n- Tax Expense: 903121.89\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1468071.54', 'value2': '138957.79', 'value3': '351260.94', 'value4': '903121.89'} }\n```",
