Since the amount is negative (-6100000.00), it means an increase in inventory assets, not a reduction.\n\nStep 5: The task asks for the \"reduction in the amount of assets held for sale.\"  \nSince the value is -6100000.00 (an increase), there is no direct positive reduction indicated in the details.\n\nStep 6: None of the other line items specifically mention assets held for sale or similar items.\n\nStep 7: In the example, the solution extracted the amount of the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" line even if it was negative. So it is best to follow the same logic.\n\nTherefore, the identified line item is \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" and the value is -6100000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-6100000.00\"}}\n```",
