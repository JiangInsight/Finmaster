Costs to secure customer orders are generally reflected in **Selling Expenses**.\n2. Costs to deliver goods and services to customers are typically captured in **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**.\n\nFrom the given income statement:\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 13,100,000.00\n- Selling Expenses = 1,468,071.54\n\nThus, the total relevant costs are primarily these two figures, representing delivery and order securing expenses.\n\nHowever, the example solution only provides one value (based on the example given in the instruction). Since the task is to identify and extract the \"specific line items and value of costs incurred\" for both securing orders and delivering goods, and from the example only the selling expenses value was given, the focus should be primarily on the **Selling Expenses** line which is specifically about securing customer orders (marketing, sales costs, etc.).\n\nCOGS relates more to the cost of producing/delivering goods but is not explicitly about securing orders.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"1468071.54\"} }\n```\n\nThis corresponds to the Selling Expenses, the costs incurred to secure customer orders.",
