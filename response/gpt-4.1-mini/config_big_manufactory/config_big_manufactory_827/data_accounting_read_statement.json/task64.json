Identify the three specific line items and values as requested:\n\n   - The line item for **capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares** should correspond to \"Paid-in Capital\" in the Balance Sheet.\n   - The line item for **profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense** corresponds to \"Profit Before Tax\" in the Income Statement.\n   - The line item for **the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period** corresponds to \"Accounts Payable\" in the Balance Sheet (the increase in Accounts Payable during the period).\n\n2. Extract their values from the statements:\n\n   **Balance Sheet:**\n   - \"Paid-in Capital\" end amount = 28000000.00 (capital contributed by shareholders)\n   - \"Accounts Payable\" end amount = 1000000.00 (the addition in amount owed)\n\n   **Income Statement:**\n   - \"Profit Before Tax\" amount = 2154033.87 (profit before tax)\n\n3. Order the results following the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement.\n\n   - From Balance Sheet: two values to select based on the problem statement:\n     - capital contributed by shareholders = \"Paid-in Capital\" = 28000000.00\n     - addition in amount owed to suppliers = \"Accounts Payable\" = 1000000.00\n   - From Income Statement: profit or loss before tax = 2154033.87\n\n4. Since the problem requests three specific values:\n   - value1: capital contributed by shareholders -> Paid-in Capital (Balance Sheet)\n   - value2: profit or loss before tax -> Profit Before Tax (Income Statement)\n   - value3: addition in amount owed (increase in Accounts Payable) -> Accounts Payable (Balance Sheet)\n\n5. Final answers:\n   - value1 = \"28000000.00\"\n   - value2 = \"2154033.87\"\n   - value3 = \"1000000.00\"\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28000000.00', 'value2': '2154033.87', 'value3': '1000000.00'} }\n```",
