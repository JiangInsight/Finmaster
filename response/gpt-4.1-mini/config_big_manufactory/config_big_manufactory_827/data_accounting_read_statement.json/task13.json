Accumulated Depreciation reduces the fixed assets but the net value is represented in the Total Non-current Assets.\n\nHence, the values representing assets not intended for sale or consumption are:\n- Initial value: 8,000,000.00\n- End value: 10,357,063.81\n\nThis matches the Total Non-current Assets line item.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"10357063.81\"}}\n```",
