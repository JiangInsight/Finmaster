                        "content": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. We need to identify the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities related to:\n   - Acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents.\n   - Receipt of interest and dividends.\n\n2. We are given a cash flow statement with line items and amounts.\n\n3. Typically, these activities would be found under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\"\n\n4. In the provided problem, under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" the only relevant line item is:\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 2,496,021.60 (positive number here suggests cash outflow or could be reversed).\n\n5. The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is -2,496,021.60, indicating overall cash used in investing activities.\n\n6. As per the task example, the net amount is the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" (which includes acquisition/disposal of long-term assets and receipt of interest/dividends).\n\n7. However, the only sub-item provided here is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" with an amount of 2,496,021.60.\n\n8. No line for \"Receipt of interest and dividends\" is present, so we consider only purchase of fixed assets for decomposition.\n\nConclusion:\n\n- The net value: -2,496,021.60 (this is the net cash generated from investing activities; negative means cash outflow).\n\n- The sub-item: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": 2,496,021.60 (positive amount given, but typically a purchase is cash outflow).\n\nSince the sign of sub-item in the problem is positive 2,496,021.60 but the net cash flow from investing is negative 2,496,021.60, this likely means that the purchase represents cash outflow of 2,496,021.60.\n\nTherefore, output is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-2496021.60\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"2496021.60\"}}\n```\n\n# Final answer follows the required format.",
