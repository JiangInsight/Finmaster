From the given balance sheet data, only current liabilities are given explicitly, and non-current liabilities are not directly listed.\n\nGiven Data:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -13,358,400.82 (negative cash flow)\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n- No explicit non-current liabilities are shown, so total debt = current liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n\nStep 1: Calculate Total Debt\n- Since there is no mention of Long-term Liabilities or other non-current liabilities, assume total debt = total current liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n\nStep 2: Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{-13,358,400.82}{1,903,121.89} = -7.02\n\\]\n\nInterpretation: The ratio is negative and large in magnitude, indicating that cash outflow from operating activities is significant relative to debt.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-7.02\"}}\n```",
