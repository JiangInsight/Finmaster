The \"Net Cash Ratio,\" sometimes referred to as the \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio,\" measures operating cash flow relative to net income.\n\nCommonly, it is defined as:\n\nNet Cash Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit\n\nGiven data:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -13,358,400.82\n- Net Profit = 1,250,911.98\n\nCalculate:\n\nNet Cash Ratio = (-13,358,400.82) / 1,250,911.98 â‰ˆ -10.68\n\nThis negative value indicates cash outflow relative to net profit, possibly suggesting that the company is facing cash flow challenges despite reporting net profit.\n\nHence,\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Ratio\": \"-10.68\"}}",
