Thus, the recorded date is inconsistent with the invoice. The original/correct date should be 2024-01-09.\n\n- The recorded unit price is 1690132.81 while the invoice states 2070499.57, which is consistent with the total amount and tax. Since invoice values are more reliable, the recorded unit price is underestimated and should be corrected to 2070499.57.\n\n- The recorded payment/receipt status is \"Unpaid\" as per field but invoice description indicates it's unpaid as well, so no discrepancy here.\n\n- Quantity matches as 1.0, no issue.\n\n- Other fields like receive method (account receivable), cost amount, tax, and profit align with the invoice.\n\nHence only date and unit price fields show inconsistency and are corrected accordingly.\n",
