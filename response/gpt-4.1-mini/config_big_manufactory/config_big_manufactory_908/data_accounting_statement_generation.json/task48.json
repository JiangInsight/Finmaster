                        "content": "To calculate the final net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement, we need to:\n\n1. Identify the initial cash and bank deposits (initial cash and bank balances).\n2. Add all cash inflows (receipts) that increase cash and cash equivalents.\n3. Subtract all cash outflows (payments) that decrease cash and cash equivalents.\n4. Consider cash transfers between cash and bank (these do NOT change total cash and cash equivalents, so they cancel out).\n5. Ignore non-cash transactions such as purchases on credit (unpaid), depreciation, and interest receivables unpaid (not yet received cash).\n6. Consider only transactions paid by cash or bank transfer that affect cash and cash equivalents.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Cash and Bank Deposits\n\n- Initial Cash deposit: 5,000,000.0\n- Initial Bank deposit: 15,000,000.0\n\nTotal initial cash and cash equivalents = 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 = **20,000,000**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Cash Inflows that Increase Cash\n\nCash inflows come mainly from sales paid in cash or bank transfer (recorded_amount with payment_method = Cash or Bank Transfer and payment/receipt_status = Paid)\n\nFrom the sales entries, certain sales are Cash or Bank transfer paid - their amounts add to cash:\n\nBut looking carefully, the \"payment_method\" field is not fully directly given for sales, but sales with payment_method 'Cash' and status 'Paid' mean cash inflow.\n\nWe'll sum amounts where sales are marked 'Paid' and payment_method = Cash.\n\nSales with payment_method = Cash and status = Paid:\n\n- Sale20240116016: 651,423.21 Cash Paid\n- Sale20240123026: 710,732.4 Cash Paid\n- Sale20240125027: 2,008,346.63 Cash Paid\n- Sale20240128030: 2,099,974.04 Cash Paid\n- Sale20240130032: 1,384,532.44 Cash Paid\n\nAlso others in the list having payment_method \"Cash\" and status \"Paid\".\n\nLet me extract all sales entries with payment_method = 'Cash' and paid:\n\nLook for rows where \"type\" = Sale and \"payment_method\" = Cash and \"payment/receipt_status\" = Paid.\n\nChecking the input for sales entries paid by Cash:\n\nMatching rows (from problem data), I'll sum:\n\n- Sale20240116016: amount 651,423.21 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240123026: 710,732.4 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240125027: 2,008,346.63 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240128030: 2,099,974.04 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240130032: 1,384,532.44 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240106009: 243,947.96 (Cash, Paid) -- from initial text (was for example, not problem)\n- Sale20240107011: 101,795.8 (Cash, Paid) -- from example, ignore\n- Sale20240110017: 96,447.68 (Cash, Paid) -- from example, ignore\n\n*We should only consider the problem input, so exclude example transactions.*\n\nFrom problem input, other cash receipts:\n\n- There are some other sales with Cash payment and Paid status:\n\nFrom scanning the problem data:\n\n- Sale20240116016 (1,651,423.21)\n- Sale20240123026 (710,732.4)\n- Sale20240125027 (2,008,346.63)\n- Sale20240128030 (2,099,974.04)\n- Sale20240130032 (1,384,532.44)\n- Sale20240120023 (659,057.2) (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240122037 - no in problem data\n- Sale20240120023 - yes\n- Sale20240107011 - no problem data\n- Sale20240125027 - already included\n- Sale20240123026 - included\n- Sale20240116016 - included\n- Sale20240102002 etc. - irrelevant here\n\nSum these:\n\n651,423.21 + 710,732.4 + 2,008,346.63 + 2,099,974.04 + 1,384,532.44 + 659,057.2 =\n\nCalculate sum:\n\n651,423.21  \n+ 710,732.4 = 1,362,155.61  \n+ 2,008,346.63 = 3,370,502.24  \n+ 2,099,974.04 = 5,470,476.28  \n+ 1,384,532.44 = 6,855,008.72  \n+ 659,057.2 = 7,514,065.92\n\nSo total cash inflow from sales paid by cash: **7,514,065.92**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Cash Outflows that Decrease Cash\n\nCash outflows are all payments done \"Paid\" with payment_method = Cash or Bank Transfer.\n\nLook at purchases and expenses paid by cash or bank transfer.\n\n---\n\n#### Purchases paid (affecting cash):\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 2,000,000.0 - Payment

1,500,000.0\n\nTotal cash purchase outflow = 1,600,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,500,000 = 5,600,000.0\n\nBank Transfer purchase outflows:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 2,000,000.0\n-

equivalents = Initial + net change\n\n= 20,000,000 + (-12,370,966.15) = 7,629,033.85\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Result\n\nThe net increase in cash and cash equivalents is final minus
