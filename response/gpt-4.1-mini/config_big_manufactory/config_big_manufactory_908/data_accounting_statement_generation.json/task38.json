Initial Accounts Receivable balance at the beginning date (2023-12-31).\n2. Ending Accounts Receivable balance at the ending date (latest transaction, here it seems around 2024-02-05).\n3. The net change = Ending balance - Beginning balance.\n\nSteps:\n\n- The dataset shows many sales transactions with \"Account Receviable\" (spelling consistent with the dataset), listed in the field `payment/receipt_status` or `receive_method`.\n- The sales lines with `receive_method` = \"Account Receviable\" represent accounts receivable (uncollected sales).\n- Extract all entries with `receive_method`=\"Account Receviable\" or similar (unpaid sales).\n- The initial accounts receivable balance at 2023-12-31 is not explicitly given, but since there is an Initial entry for Cash and Bank deposits and Fixed Assets, but no explicit initial accounts receivable, we assume it to be zero or negligible.\n- Sum all sales on account receivable during the period (unpaid sales).\n- Also consider that sales marked as \"Paid\" are collected and thus do not increase accounts receivable.\n- Calculate total sales on accounts receivable at the beginning and end:\n  - Beginning at 2023-12-31 is zero (no explicit initial accounts receivable)\n  - Ending accounts receivable = Total unpaid sales till the end minus the collections (sales marked Paid).\n\nLet's calculate total accounts receivable (unpaid sales):\n\nFrom the data, focusing on sales with `receive_method`=\"Account Receviable\" or those with `payment/receipt_status` as \"Unpaid\" and `receive_method` as \"Account Receviable\".\n\nExtract all such sales amounts (amount or after_tax_amount relevant):\n\nChecking sales with receive_method = \"Account Receviable\":\n\nSales entries of interest:\n\n- Sale20240103002: 1,302,111.59 unpaid\n- Sale20240108007: 1,460,946.33 unpaid\n- Sale20240109009: 1,489,365.79 unpaid\n- Sale20240115014: 674,738.01 unpaid\n- Sale20240117018: 1,124,652.91 unpaid\n- Sale20240118019: 1,166,055.78 unpaid\n- Sale20240119021: 1,150,635.95 unpaid\n- Sale20240122024: 1,499,323.77 unpaid\n- Sale20240202036: 2,063,873.27 unpaid\n- Sale20240204039: 2,002,579.13 unpaid\n- Sale20240205041: 1,428,329.11 unpaid\n\nAlso from other sales marked as with receive_method \"Account Receviable\" and unpaid:\n\n- Sale20240110016: 124,688.16 unpaid\n- Sale20240114022: 24,676.98 unpaid\n- Sale20240114023: 317,862.15 unpaid\n- Sale20240124041: 121,475.35 unpaid\n- Sale20240124042: 51,480.08 unpaid\n- Sale20240125044: 124,952.5 unpaid\n- Sale20240125045: 24,341.12 unpaid\n- Sale20240126047: 168,960.87 unpaid\n- Sale20240128053: 113,413.1 unpaid\n- Sale20240129055: 231,897.32 paid (so not accounts receivable)\n- Sale20240129054: 35,752.38 paid (not accounts receivable)\n- Sale20240130057: 74,300.25 paid (not accounts receivable)\n- Sale20240130056: 128,279.1 paid (not accounts receivable)\n\nLooking again: The problem states date range likely from 2023-12-31 to 2024-02-05, so all these sales counts.\n\nTo calculate accounts receivable at start and end:\n\n- Initial accounts receivable at 2023-12-31: Since no explicit line, assume zero.\n\n- Ending accounts receivable at 2024-02-05: Sum of unpaid sales amounts on accounts receivable, minus collections.\n\nBut collections are reflected by sales marked as \"Paid\" with receive_method \"Cash\".\n\nWe can sum all unpaid sales with receive_method \"Account Receviable\" - these represent the accounts receivable balance.\n\nSum these unpaid sales amounts:\n\nCalculate the sum of amounts of all sales with receive_method: \"Account Receviable\" and unpaid status:\n\nCollect all such amounts from data:\n\nBelow is the list of unpaid Sales with accounts receivable and their amounts:\n\n1.
