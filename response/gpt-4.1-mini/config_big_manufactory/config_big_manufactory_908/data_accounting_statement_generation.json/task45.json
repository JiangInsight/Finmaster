This typically includes:\n\n- Cash outflows for purchase of fixed assets or property, plant, equipment (PPE) (purchase of heavy equipment or facilities).\n- Cash inflows from sales of these assets (sale of heavy equipment, etc).  \n- Other investing cash flows if applicable (e.g., sale of investments).  \n- Non-cash transactions and operating/financing cash flows are excluded.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Identify investing activities**\n\nFrom the dataset provided, investing activities principally consist of:\n\n- Fixed asset purchases: Entries with type like \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or purchase of heavy equipment.\n- Asset sales: Entries with \"Sale\" relating to heavy equipment or fixed assets.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Sum cash inflows from sale of fixed assets**\n\nLook for \"Sale\" transactions related to heavy equipment or fixed assets and consider only actual cash collections (\"Paid\" status or cash receipt):\n\nSales related to heavy equipment (from \"Sale\" rows with product_name or asset):\n\n- Only sales with payment/receipt_status either \"Paid\" or cash received.\n\nList of sales with \"Paid\" status (amount as cash inflow):\n\n- 2024-01-03 Sale: 1,302,111.59 (Unpaid, so no cash inflow yet)\n- 2024-01-15 Sale: 674,738.01 (Unpaid, no cash inflow)\n- 2024-01-16 Sale: 651,423.21 (Paid) -> 651,423.21\n- 2024-01-23 Sale: 710,732.4 (Paid) -> 710,732.40\n- 2024-01-25 Sale: 2,008,346.63 (Paid) -> 2,008,346.63\n- 2024-01-28 Sale: 2,099,974.04 (Paid) -> 2,099,974.04\n- 2024-01-30 Sale: 1,384,532.44 (Paid) -> 1,384,532.44\n\nTotal cash inflows from sale =  \n651,423.21 + 710,732.40 + 2,008,346.63 + 2,099,974.04 + 1,384,532.44 = 6,855,008.72\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Sum cash outflows from purchase of fixed assets**\n\nLook for:\n\n- Purchase transactions related to fixed assets or heavy equipment\n- FixedAssetsPurchase with Bank Transfer or Cash paid (payment_method)\n- Only \"Paid\" transactions count as cash outflow\n\nPurchases:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 2,000,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231002: 1,500,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231003: 1,600,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231004: 500,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231005: 1,000,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231006: 1,500,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231008: 1,000,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231010: 800,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231011: 1,600,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231012: 500,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231014: 2,000,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231015: 1,500,000.0 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231016: 1,500,000.0 (Paid)\n\nSum all paid purchases:\n\n2,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,600,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,000,000 + 800,000 + 1,600,000 + 500,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,500,000  \n= 17,500,000.0\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Include fixed assets purchase entries**\n\n- FixedAsset20231231001 entries with amount and \"Paid\" status and payment_method Bank Transfer:\n\n- 1,219,968.64  \n- 1,509,063.62  \n- 1,500,963.62  \n\nSum: 1,219,968.64 + 1,509,063.62 + 1,500,963.62 = 4,229,995.88\n\nThese are additional fixed asset purchases and should be treated as investing cash outflows.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Calculate net cash flow from investing activities**\n\nNet Cash Flow from Investing Activities = Cash inflows from sale - Cash outflows for purchases\n\n= 6,855,008.72 - (17,500,000 + 4,229,995.88)  \n= 6,855,008.72 - 21,729,995.88  \n= -14,874,987.16\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-14874987.16\"}}\n```",
