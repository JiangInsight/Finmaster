                        "content": "To solve the task, we need to find the initial and final values of accounts payable from the given transactions.\n\n**Steps and reasoning:**\n\n1. **Initial Accounts Payable:**\n   - There is no explicit \"accounts payable\" initial amount line in the initial records.\n   - The initial balances include Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets only.\n   - Since no initial accounts payable is given or mentioned, initial value is **0.00**.\n\n2. **Calculate accounts payable changes during the period:**\n   - We look for purchases whose payment status is \"Unpaid\" and method includes \"Account Payable\".\n   - Those represent outstanding obligations to suppliers, i.e., accounts payable.\n   - Each \"Purchase\" transaction with **payment/receipt_status = Unpaid** and related to accounts payable adds to accounts payable.\n   - Purchases marked as \"Paid\" do not increase accounts payable.\n\n3. **Identify Unpaid purchases with accounts payable:**\n   From the data:\n\n   - Purchase20231231007  \n     - Purchase amount = 1,000,000.0  \n     - Payment status: Unpaid  \n     - Payment method: Account Payable  \n     - Accounts payable amount: 1,000,000.0\n\n   - Purchase20231231013  \n     - Purchase amount = 1,000,000.0  \n     - Unpaid  \n     - Account Payable  \n     - 500,000.0 (payment_method value or cost_per_unit? The task says cost_per_unit is 500,000, amount 1,000,000 for 2 quantity. But payment_method field value is \"Account Payable\". Here stated in the payment_method field as \"Account Payable\". So amount is 1,000,000, and unpaid, counts as accounts payable.)  \n     Yes, amount is 1,000,000, unpaid, so we add 1,000,000.\n\n   But check the field carefully:  \n   Actually, in the record, payment/receipt_status = Unpaid  \n   payment_method = Account Payable  \n   cost_per_unit = 500,000.0  \n   quantity = 2  \n   amount = 1,000,000.0\n\n   So accounts payable amount is 1,000,000.\n\n   - Purchase20231231007 is 1,000,000 Unpaid Account Payable\n\n   - Purchase20231231013 is 1,000,000 Unpaid Account Payable\n\n   Are there any others?\n\n   Review all purchases with payment status \"Unpaid\" and payment_method \"Account Payable\":\n\n   - Purchase20231231007 = 1,000,000 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n   - Purchase20231231013 = 1,000,000 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n   - Any other?\n\n   None other are unpaid with Account Payable method.\n\n4. **Calculate total unpaid purchases (accounts payable):**\n\n   Total accounts payable end value = 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 2,000,000\n\n   But the problem has to consider if payment_method shows \"Account Payable\" and status \"Unpaid\".\n\n   Wait, the Purchase20231231013 shows amount 1,000,000, but cost_per_unit 500,000, quantity 2, and payment/receipt_status \"Unpaid\" - yes, counts fully as accounts payable.\n\n5. **Did any accounts payable pay during the period?**\n   - Some purchases are \"Paid\" so do not count in accounts payable.\n   - No purchases marked as paid that were previously unpaid accounts payable (no initial accounts payable, so no reduction).\n  \n6. **Double-check initial accounts payable:**\n   - The initial dataset only contains cash, bank, fixed assets.\n   - No accounts payable at the start, so initial is 0.00.\n\n7. **Final accounts payable = sum of unpaid purchases payable to suppliers.**\n\n   After rechecking, there's a Purchase with:\n\n   - Purchase20231231007 - Amount 1,000,000 Unpaid Account Payable  \n   - Purchase20231231013 - Amount 1,000,000 Unpaid Account Payable  \n   Additionally, purchase20231231004 is Paid, purchase20231231011 Paid, etc.\n\n   Therefore, total unpaid accounts payable is 2,000,000.\n\n**However, in the problem example, the shown solution output has:**\n\n{'Accounts Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accounts Payable End Value': '1590000.00'}\n\nThat example is not the same data as current problem.\n\nWe must calculate carefully for this problem only.\n\n---\n\n**Verify if Purchase20231231007 is 1,000,000 Unpaid Account Payable**\n\nYes.\n\n**Purchase20231231013 is 1,000,000 Unpaid Account Payable**\n\nYes.\n\n**Purchase202312310... Noticed Purchase20231231003: Paid**\n\nPurchase20231231003 is Paid.\n\n**Is there any other, smaller amounts?**\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nCheck the following to avoid misinterpretation:\n\n- The field \"payment_method\" sometimes holds cash, bank transfer, or \"Account Payable\".\n- The field \"cost_per_unit\" included but not needed directly except for verifying amounts.\n- Focus on: purchase records where payment/receipt_status == \"Unpaid\" and payment_method == \"Account Payable\"\n\n---\n\nSummary:\n\n- Initial accounts payable: 0.00 (no unpaid purchases at year end starting balance)\n- Final accounts payable: sum of Purchases with Unpaid + Account Payable:\n\n- Purchase20231231007: 1,000,000  \n- Purchase20231231013: 1,000,000\n\nSum = 2,000,000.0\n\n---\n\nAdditionally, check if another purchase matches Unpaid, Account Payable:\n\n- Purchase20231231007 is Unpaid, Account Payable = 1,000,000\n\n- Purchase20231231013 is Unpaid, Account Payable = 1,000,000\n\n- Purchase20231231011 is Paid\n\n- Purchase20231231004 is Paid\n\nNo others.\n\n---\n\n**Double check for any amount mismatch or input error:**\n\nWait, for Purchase20231231013 notes:  \n\"Payment/receipt_status\": Unpaid  \n\"payment_method\": Account Payable  \n\"amount\": 1,000,000.0\n\nYes, all good.\n\n---\n\n**Final values:**\n\n- Initial Accounts Payable: 0.00  \n- End Accounts Payable: 2,000,000.00\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"2000000.00\"}}\n```\n\n# Short explanation:\n\nInitial value is zero since no outstanding unpaid purchases at the beginning. End value is sum of purchases unpaid and with Account Payable method, totaling 2,000,000.\n\n# Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"2000000.00\"}}\n```\n",
