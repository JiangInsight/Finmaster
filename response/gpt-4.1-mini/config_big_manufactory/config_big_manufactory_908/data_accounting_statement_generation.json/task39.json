The interest receivables are marked \"Unpaid\" and the amounts accumulate as receivable assets.\n\nWe want the net change in interest receivables during the period, i.e.:\n\nChange in Interest Receivable = Interest Receivable at end of period - Interest Receivable at beginning of period\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total interest receivable at the start and end dates.**\n\n- Since no initial interest receivable balance is provided at 2023-12-31, we will sum all interest receivable amounts with recorded_date = 2023-12-31 or before as the initial balance. From dataset only data from 2024-01-01 onwards appears, so initial balance = 0.\n\n- Sum all interest receivables on last reported date (2024-02-05) or cumulatively the last available entries.\n\nBut given no direct balance snapshot for interest receivables is provided, the way to calculate change is:\n\nThe net change in interest receivables is the net sum of all interest receivables transactions recorded between the dates.\n\n**Step 4: Sum all interest receivable amounts from interest receivable entries for the period.**\n\nSumming all \"amount\" values of Interest Receivables type entries from 2024-01-01 to 2024-02-05:\n\nList of Interest Receivables amounts from data (some examples extracted, dates ascending):\n\n- 2024-01-01: 1157.0  \n- 2024-01-02: 1023.5  \n- 2024-01-03: 890.0  \n- 2024-01-04: 756.5  \n- 2024-01-05: 756.5  \n- 2024-01-06: 756.5  \n- 2024-01-07: 647.92279104  \n- 2024-01-08: 647.92279104  \n- 2024-01-09: 558.92279104  \n- 2024-01-10: 558.92279104  \n- 2024-01-11: 424.61612886  \n- 2024-01-12: 424.61612886  \n- 2024-01-13: 424.61612886  \n- 2024-01-14: 424.61612886  \n- 2024-01-15: 424.61612886  \n- 2024-01-16: 424.61612886  \n- 2024-01-17: 353.41612886  \n- 2024-01-18: 211.01612886  \n- 2024-01-19: 166.51612886  \n- 2024-01-20: 166.51612886  \n- 2024-01-21: 166.51612886  \n- 2024-01-22: 77.51612886  \n- 2024-01-23: 77.51612886  \n- 2024-01-24: 77.51612886  \n- 2024-01-25: 77.51612886  \n- 2024-01-26: 77.51612886  \n- 2024-01-27: 166.51612886  \n- 2024-01-28: 166.51612886  \n- 2024-01-29: 166.51612886  \n- 2024-02-01: 166.51612886  \n- 2024-02-02: 166.51612886  \n- 2024-02-03: 166.51612886  \n- 2024-02-04: 166.51612886  \n- 2024-02-05: -11.48387114\n\n**Sum these amounts:**  \n\nLet's add them stepwise:\n\n(1) Sum of steady amounts:  \n\n- From 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-03 (3 days):  \n  1157 + 1023.5 + 890 = 3070.5\n\n- 2024-01-04 to 2024-01-06 (3 days):  \n  756.5 * 3 = 2269.5  \n  Cumulative total: 3070.5 + 2269.5 = 5340\n\n- 2024-01-07 to 2024-01-08 (2 days):  \n  647.92279104 * 2 = 1295.84558208  \n  Total: 5340 + 1295.84558208 = 6635.84558208\n\n- 2024-01-09 to 2024-01-10 (2 days):  \n  558.92279104 * 2 = 1117.84558208  \n  Total: 6635.84558208 + 1117.84558208 = 7753.69116416\n\n- 2024-01-11 to 2024-01-16 (6 days):  \n  424.61612886 * 6 = 2547.69677316  \n  Total: 7753.69116416 + 2547.69677316 = 10301.38793732\n\n- 2024-01-17: 353.41612886  \n  Total: 10301.38793732 + 353.41612886 = 10654.80406618\n\n- 2024-01-18: 211.01612886  \n  Total: 10654.80406618 + 211.01612886 = 10865.82019504\n\n- 2024-01-19 to 2024-01-21 (3 days):  \n  166.51612886 * 3 = 499.54838658  \n  Total: 10865.82019504 + 499.54838658 = 11365.36858162\n\n- 2024-01-22 to 2024-01-26 (5 days):  \n  From above days interest is 77.51612886 each except for 27th and 28th etc.  \n  77.51612886 * 5 = 387.5806443  \n  Total: 11365.36858162 + 387.5806443 = 11752.94922592\n\n- 2024-01-27: 166.51612886  \n  Total: 11752.94922592 + 166.51612886 = 11919.46535478\n\n- 2024-01-28 to 2024-01-29 (2 days):  \n  166.51612886 * 2 = 333.03225772  \n  Total: 11919.46535478 + 333.03225772 = 12252.4976125\n\n- 2024-02-01 to 2024-02-04 (4 days):  \n  166.51612886 * 4 = 666.06451544  \n  Total: 12252.4976125 + 666.06451544 = 12918.56212794\n\n- 2024-02-05: -11.48387114  \n  Total: 12918.56212794 - 11.48387114 = 12907.0782568\n\n**Step 5: Result**  \nSince initial interest receivable balance = 0, the increase in interest receivable = 12,907.08 (rounded to 2 decimals).\n\nFor the cash flow statement, the increase in interest receivable is a use of cash, thus it is shown as negative:  \n**(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable = -12907.08**\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-12907.08\"}}\n```",
