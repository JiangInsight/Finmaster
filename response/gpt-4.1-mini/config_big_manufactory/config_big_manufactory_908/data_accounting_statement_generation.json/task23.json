We sum all these cost_amount values to find the total cost of goods sold.\n\nLet's sum the cost_amount values appearing in sale entries (identified by type \"Sale\"). Extract cost_amount values:\n\n- Sale20240103002: 1,000,000.0\n- Sale20240108007: 1,000,000.0\n- Sale20240109009: 1,000,000.0\n- Sale20240115014: 500,000.0\n- Sale20240116016: 500,000.0\n- Sale20240117018: 800,000.0\n- Sale20240118019: 800,000.0\n- Sale20240119021: 800,000.0\n- Sale20240120023: 500,000.0\n- Sale20240122024: 1,000,000.0\n- Sale20240123026: 500,000.0\n- Sale20240125027: 1,500,000.0\n- Sale20240128030: 1,500,000.0\n- Sale20240130032: 1,000,000.0\n- Sale20240202036: 1,500,000.0\n- Sale20240204039: 1,500,000.0\n- Sale20240205041: 1,000,000.0\n\nSum these:\n\n= 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 + 800,000 + 800,000 + 800,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,000,000\n\nCalculate stepwise:\n\n1,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 2,000,000  \n2,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 3,000,000  \n3,000,000 + 500,000 = 3,500,000  \n3,500,000 + 500,000 = 4,000,000  \n4,000,000 + 800,000 = 4,800,000  \n4,800,000 + 800,000 = 5,600,000  \n5,600,000 + 800,000 = 6,400,000  \n6,400,000 + 500,000 = 6,900,000  \n6,900,000 + 1,000,000 = 7,900,000  \n7,900,000 + 500,000 = 8,400,000  \n8,400,000 + 1,500,000 = 9,900,000  \n9,900,000 + 1,500,000 = 11,400,000  \n11,400,000 + 1,000,000 = 12,400,000  \n12,400,000 + 1,500,000 = 13,900,000  \n13,900,000 + 1,500,000 = 15,400,000  \n15,400,000 + 1,000,000 = 16,400,000\n\n**Total Cost of Goods Sold = 16,400,000.00**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Validate purchases total vs COGS**\n\nTotal purchases (sum of purchase amounts) are:\n\n- 2,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,600,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,000,000 + 3,000,000\n\nCalculate stepwise:\n\n2,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 3,500,000  \n3,500,000 + 1,600,000 = 5,100,000  \n5,100,000 + 500,000 = 5,600,000  \n5,600,000 + 1,000,000 = 6,600,000  \n6,600,000 + 1,500,000 = 8,100,000  \n8,100,000 + 1,000,000 = 9,100,000  \n9,100,000 + 1,000,000 = 10,100,000  \n10,100,000 + 1,000,000 = 11,100,000  \n11,100,000 + 1,500,000 = 12,600,000  \n12,600,000 + 1,000,000 = 13,600,000  \n13,600,000 + 2,000,000 = 15,600,000  \n15,600,000 + 1,500,000 = 17,100,000  \n17,100,000 + 1,000,000 = 18,100,000  \n18,100,000 + 3,000,000 = 21,100,000\n\nTotal purchases = 21,100,000.  \nCOGS (16,400,000) less than purchases (21,100,000) is reasonable as some goods remain in inventory.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"16400000.00\"}}\n```",
