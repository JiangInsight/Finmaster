Paid-in capital generally includes cash and bank deposits contributed by investors, not fixed assets.\n\nHence, initial paid-in capital = Cash deposit + Bank deposit = 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 = 20,000,000.0\n\n**Step 2: Check for additional paid-in capital during the period.**\n\nWe look for any entries that would indicate additional paid-in capital contributions. \"Purchase\", \"Expense\", \"Sale\", \"Interest Receivables\", \"Fixed Assets Purchase\", \"Transfer\" etc. are operational entries and not contributions of paid-in capital.\n\nThe given dataset and descriptions do not show any further paid-in capital additions or subtractions.\n\n**Step 3: Determine ending paid-in capital.**\n\nSince there are no changes to paid-in capital indicated in the transactions, the ending paid-in capital remains the same as the initial:\n\nEnding paid-in capital = 20,000,000.00\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"20000000.00\", \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"20000000.00\"}}\n```",
