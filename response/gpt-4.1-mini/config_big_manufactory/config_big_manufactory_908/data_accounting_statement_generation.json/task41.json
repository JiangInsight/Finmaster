That normally represents the net increase or decrease of accounts payable (liability), which equals:\n\n**Accounts Payable Increase (Decrease) = Purchases on credit (Unpaid) - Payments of accounts payable**\n\nBut we need to know initial accounts payable, or the net change over the period.\n\nIn this data, we have two \"Unpaid\" purchases totaling 2,000,000, and presumably, payments have been made for other purchases.\n\nAssuming at the beginning of the period the accounts payable was zero, then the ending accounts payable = 2,000,000.\n\nSo the net change (increase) in accounts payable is 2,000,000 (current unpaid purchases) - 0 (beginning accounts payable) = 2,000,000.\n\nBut to confirm payments, we must see if payments correspond to accounts payable.\n\nBut the data mixes payment methods and status, so must consider:\n\n- Only purchases with \"Unpaid\" and payment method \"Account Payable\" increase accounts payable. \n- Paid purchases imply accounts payable reduced or paid off.\n\nTherefore, to find the **increase (decrease)** in accounts payable for cash flow:\n\n- Sum all purchases with status \"Unpaid\" and payment method \"Account Payable\" => 2,000,000  \n- Sum payments made on accounts payable over the period (paid purchases) but only those previously recorded as accounts payable (which may not be explicitly listed).\n\nFrom the problem data the initial accounts payable is not explicitly given; since initial balances for accounts payable are not given, assume opening accounts payable is zero.\n\nHence, for simplicity:\n\n**Increase in accounts payable = Ending unpaid purchases (2,000,000) - Opening accounts payable (assumed 0) = 2,000,000**\n\n---\n\n### Final result:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"2000000.00\"}}\n````",
