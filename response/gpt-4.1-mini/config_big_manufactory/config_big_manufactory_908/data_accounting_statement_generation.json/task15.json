But unpaid not explicitly stated except for number 07, 13.\n\nFilter those with unpaid or Account Payable:\n\n- #7: Purchase20231231007, Unpaid, amount 1,000,000\n- #13: Purchase20231231013, Unpaid, amount 500,000\n\nNo other unpaid purchases except these two clearly marked.\n\n**Step 3: Summing Liabilities (Unpaid Account Payables)**\n\n- Purchase20231231007: 1,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231013: 500,000.0\n\nTotal unpaid purchase liabilities = 1,000,000 + 500,000 = 1,500,000.00\n\n**Step 4: Check if any other liabilities included**\n\n- Some purchases might have \"payment_method\" = \"Account Payable\" and \"payment/receipt_status\" = \"Unpaid\".\n- Also, the \"amount\" field is the purchase amount, so these unpaid purchases contribute to liabilities.\n\nNo other unpaid purchases identified clearly from the data.\n\n**Step 5: Final liabilities value**\n\n- Final liabilities arise primarily from unpaid \"Account Payable\" purchases.\n- Total = 1,500,000.00\n\n**Step 6: Result**\n\n- Initial Liabilities: 0.00 (no initial liabilities from initial entries)\n- Final Liabilities: 1,500,000.00 (sum of unpaid Account Payable purchases)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"1500000.00\"}}\n```",
