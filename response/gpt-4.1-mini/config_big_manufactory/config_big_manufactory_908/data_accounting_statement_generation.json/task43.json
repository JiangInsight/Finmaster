Since we have transaction data, we will:\n\n1. Identify cash received from customers (cash sales receipts).\n2. Subtract cash paid to suppliers and employees (cash payments for purchases and operating expenses).\n3. Adjust for non-cash expenses (depreciation).\n4. Exclude investing and financing cash flows (e.g., fixed asset purchases, interest receivables, transfers between cash and bank accounts).\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Cash Inflows from Operating Activities**\n\n- **Cash sale receipts**: Sum of sales with payment_status \"Paid\" and payment_method as cash or assume paid means cash received.\n- **Exclude unpaid sales (account receivable) because cash not received yet**.\n- **Exclude interest receivables as they’re financing activities or investment income**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Cash Outflows from Operating Activities**\n\n- **Cash paid for purchases**: Purchases marked \"Paid\" and paid by cash or bank transfer (for operating activities).\n- **Operating expenses paid in cash** (Administrative, Sales, Financial Expenses) that are \"Paid\".\n- **Exclude purchases related to fixed asset acquisition—these belong to investing activities**.\n- **Ignore transfers between cash and bank as they don't affect net cash flow in operating activities**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Add back non-cash expenses**\n\n- **Depreciation expense** (non-cash operating expense).\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Summation**\n\n- Cash received from sales and other operating incomes  \n- Minus cash paid for purchases of inventory and operating expenses  \n- Plus depreciation expenses  \n- Ignore interest receivable (not cash), fixed assets purchases (investing), and transfers (financing/asset movement).\n\n---\n\n### Extract and calculate:\n\n---\n\n**Identify sales receipts (cash inflows):**\n\nSales with \"Paid\", payment_method assumed means cash inflows.\n\nSum of all \"Sale\" with payment/receipt_status = \"Paid\" (ignore unpaid sales):\n\nFrom problem dataset:\n\nSum sales receipts (Paid):\n\n- Sale20240116016: 651423.21  \n- Sale20240123026: 710732.4  \n- Sale20240125027: 2008346.63  \n- Sale20240128030: 2099974.04  \n- Sale20240130032: 1384532.44  \n- Sale20240130057: 74300.25  \n- Sale20240125014: paid status is Unpaid, ignore  \n- Others with Paid from data:  \n  Sale20240103002: Unpaid, ignore  \n  Sale20240108007: Unpaid, ignore  \n  Sale20240109009: Unpaid, ignore  \n  Sale20240125027: Paid, already counted  \n  Sale20240102002: Not listed in problem, ignore  \n  Sale20240122024: Unpaid, ignore  \n  Sale20240117018: Unpaid, ignore  \n\nSum of cash receipts from paid sales transactions:  \n651423.21 + 710732.4 + 2008346.63 + 2099974.04 + 1384532.44 + 74300.25 =  \n651423.21 + 710732.4 = 1,362,155.61  \n+ 2,008,346.63 = 3,370,502.24  \n+ 2,099,974.04 = 5,470,476.28  \n+ 1,384,532.44 = 6,855,008.72  \n+ 74,300.25 = 6,929,308.97\n\n---\n\n**Operating cash payments:**\n\n- Purchases with Paid status, exclude fixed assets (identify fixed assets by asset_name or asset_type columns):\n\nFrom purchase lines:\n\n- Purchase20231231001 Paid 2,000,000.0 (product: Heavy Equipment C) - assumed inventory  \n- Purchase20231231002 Paid 1,500,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231003 Paid 1,600,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231004 Paid 500,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231005 Paid 1,000,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231006 Paid 1,500,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231008 Paid 1,000,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231009 Paid 1,000,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231010 Paid 800,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231011 Paid 1,600,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231012 Paid 500,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231014 Paid 2,000,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231015 Paid 1,500,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231016 Paid 1,500,000.0  \n\nUnpaid purchases are not cash outflows now; exclude them.\n\nSum paid purchases:  \n2,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,600,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 800,000 + 1,600,000 + 500,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,500,000 =\n\nCalculate sum:\n\n2,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 3,500,000  \n+1,600,000 = 5,100,000  \n+500,000 = 5,600,000  \n+1,000,000 = 6,600,000  \n+1,500,000 = 8,100,000  \n+1,000,000 = 9,100,000  \n+1,000,000 = 10,100,000  \n+800,000 = 10,900,000  \n+1,600,000 = 12,500,000  \n+500,000 = 13,000,000  \n+2,000,000 = 15,000,000  \n+1,500,000 = 16,500,000  \n+1,500,000 = 18,000,000\n\n**Note**: We need to exclude fixed assets purchase from purchase total to keep only operating activities.\n\n**Fixed assets purchased:**\n\n- FixedAsset20231231001 Paid 1,219,968.64  \n- FixedAsset20231231001 Paid 1,509,063.62  \n- FixedAsset20231231001 Paid 1,509,063.62 (Industrial Facilities5)  \n- These are recorded as Fixed Assets Purchase - consuming investing activities\n\nIgnoring fixed assets purchases from purchases used above, since these appear as separate fixed asset purchases, the purchases (inventory) above likely relate to stock.\n\nTherefore, the purchase sum (inventory purchases) remains at 18,000,000 (excluding separate fixed asset purchases).\n\n---\n\n**Operating expenses paid (Administrative, Sales, Financial):**\n\nSum all Expense records with Paid status.\n\nFrom the data (only Cash paid expenses are relevant as cash outflow):\n\nExpenses are scattered.
