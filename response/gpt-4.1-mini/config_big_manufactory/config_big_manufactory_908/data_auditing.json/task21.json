The correct amount should align with the invoice/unit price and quantity, so 1124652.91 is the correct recorded price and amount.\n- Category should be \"Sale\" instead of \"Financial Expenses\".\n- Tax, cost amount, profit and other amounts are consistent with the Sale category and reflect the correct figures.\n- Dates, approver, preparer, payment status, payment_method, and other fields are consistent, so not changed.",
