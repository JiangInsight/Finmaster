Recorded amount should be 2000000.0 (which is correct) rather than any other value.\n- Thus no error detected except possibly recorded_cost_per_unit matches quantity and recorded amount, so all consistent.\n- For other entries, no discrepancies are detected that contradict invoice given the data, so solution reports no inconsistency except reiterating recorded amounts/fields for this transaction as verified.",
