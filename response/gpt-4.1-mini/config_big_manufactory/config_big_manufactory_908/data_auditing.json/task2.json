Other fields remain the same.\n- Similar date shifting was noted for Expense20240129001, but that was excluded here since not part of the request (task is to solve for given problem).\n- All other transactions have consistent details or no explicit discrepancy found.\n\nNo other inconsistencies were indicated in the provided problem data.",
