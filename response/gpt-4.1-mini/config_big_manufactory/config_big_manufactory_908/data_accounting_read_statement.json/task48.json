The task is to identify and extract two specific line items that represent:\n   - The amount of profit an entity retains after all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization.\n   - The cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\n2. From the cash flow statement given:\n   - The line item that shows the profit retained after all expenses is \"Net Profit\".\n   - The line item that indicates cash payments for acquisition of fixed assets is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n\n3. Extracting the values from the problem:\n   - Net Profit = 1938987.47\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets = 2729032.26\n\n4. These values should be returned in the order they appear in the input.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"1938987.47\", \"value2\": \"2729032.26\"} }\n```",
