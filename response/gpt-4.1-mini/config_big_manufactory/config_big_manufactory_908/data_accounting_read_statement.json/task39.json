So the \"reduction\" is negative of this number? No, the problem asks for the value of reduction, so if it's an increase, then the reduction is zero.\n\n- The problem statement does not specify whether to extract only reductions or also increases.\n\n- Based on the previous example and instructions, it seems we extract the line item value as is, representing the change.\n\n- Therefore the solution is the value of the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" line item: -6600000.00\n\n- So the answer is: {\"solution\": {'value': '-6600000.00'}} because that is the line item most closely related to the assets held for sale, in production for sale, or in the process of being manufactured.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-6600000.00'}}\n```",
