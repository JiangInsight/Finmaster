Identify the line item for the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life (i.e., Depreciation):  \n   \"Depreciation\", amount: 120631.67\n\n2. Identify the reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period:  \n   The closest matching line item is \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" since inventory represents assets in production or held for sale.  \n   Amount: -6600000.00\n\n3. Identify the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities involving acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments, not including cash equivalents, and receipt of interest and dividends:  \n   This relates to investing activities; the line we look at is \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" which represents net cash inflow or outflow from these transactions.  \n   Amount: -2729032.26\n\n4. Identify the net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period:  \n   Look for \"Net Increase\" under Cash and Cash Equivalents:  \n   Amount: -19501430.98\n\nBased on this, the extracted values in order are:  \nvalue1 = '120631.67'  \nvalue2 = '-6600000.00'  \nvalue3 = '-2729032.26'  \nvalue4 = '-19501430.98'\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"120631.67\", \"value2\": \"-6600000.00\", \"value3\": \"-2729032.26\", \"value4\": \"-19501430.98\"} }\n```",
