This refers to **depreciation**.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Check the balance sheet for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" which shows the total depreciation accumulated on assets. The end amount is 120631.67.\n\n2. Look at the cash flow statement for \"Depreciation\" which shows the depreciation expense charged during the period. It is 120631.67.\n\n3. Check the income statement for \"Depreciation\" expense, which is 120631.67.\n\nSince depreciation is consistently shown as 120631.67 across statements and it represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount, this is the value to be extracted.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"120631.67\"}}\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"120631.67\"}}\n```",
