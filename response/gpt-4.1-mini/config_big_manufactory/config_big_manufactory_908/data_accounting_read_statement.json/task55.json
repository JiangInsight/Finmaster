From the **Income Statement**:\n   - Tax Expense = 1,143,833.89\n\n2. From the **Balance Sheet**:\n   - Taxes Payable = 1,143,833.89\n\nThe same amount appears in both places, indicating this is the tax amount expected to be paid or recovered during the reporting period.\n\nHence, the total tax amount for the period is 1,143,833.89.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1143833.89'} }\n```",
