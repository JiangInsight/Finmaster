Tangible items held for use in production, supply, rental, or admin purposes are typically represented by the line item \"Fixed Assets\" on the balance sheet.\n\n2. In the problem data:\n   - Initial value of Fixed Assets is 8,000,000.00 on 2023-12-31.\n   - End value of Fixed Assets is 10,729,032.26 on 2024-02-05.\n\n3. No other asset line relates directly to tangible fixed assets. \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is related but not the asset itself; it is a contra-asset account.\n\nTherefore, the initial and end values of the tangible items (Fixed Assets) are:\n\n- Initial value: 8,000,000.00\n- End value: 10,729,032.26\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"10729032.26\"}}\n```",
