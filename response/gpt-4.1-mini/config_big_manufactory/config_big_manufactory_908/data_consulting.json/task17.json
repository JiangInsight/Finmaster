Here, there are only current liabilities listed:  \n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89  \nNo long-term liabilities are listed, so assume total debt = current liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \n= Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt  \n= (-16,772,398.72) / 3,143,833.89  \nâ‰ˆ -5.33\n\n### Interpretation:  \nA negative ratio indicates that the operating cash flow is negative relative to the debt level, which could indicate liquidity stress.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-5.33\"}}\n```",
