Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -16,772,398.72  \n2. Current Liabilities (Ending balance) = Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n\nWe use the ending balance of current liabilities as no initial data for these is provided (initial amount is 0).\n\nCalculate:\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio â‰ˆ -5.34\n\nThe Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately -5.34, meaning the operating cash flow is negative and covers current liabilities poorly.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-5.34\"}}\n```",
