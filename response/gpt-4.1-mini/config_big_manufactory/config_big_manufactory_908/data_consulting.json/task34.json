                        "content": "First, let's identify the necessary data from the financial statements:\n\n### Given Data:\n\n**Balance Sheet (End amounts):**  \n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89  \n- Total Owner's Equity = 29,938,987.47  \n- Total Assets = 33,082,821.36  \n- Accounts Receivable = 15,362,611.64  \n- Inventory = 6,600,000.00  \n- Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable = 627,601.28 + (-129,032.26) + 13,240.11 = 511,809.13 (usable as quick assets)\n\n**Cash Flow:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -16,772,398.72\n\n**Income Statement:**\n- Net Profit = 1,938,987.47  \n- Total Revenue = 22,876,677.56\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n= Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities  \n= -16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ -5.34\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Debt to Equity Ratio  \nDebt = Total Liabilities = Total Assets - Total Owner's Equity  \n= 33,082,821.36 - 29,938,987.47 = 3,143,833.89 (matches current liabilities exactly, no long term liabilities given)  \nDebt to Equity = Debt / Equity = 3,143,833.89 / 29,938,987.47 ≈ 0.105\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n= Total Revenue / Total Assets  \n= 22,876,677.56 / 33,082,821.36 ≈ 0.692\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Quick Ratio  \nQuick Assets = Cash and equivalents + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable  \nHere Quick Assets traditionally exclude Inventory. Some definitions exclude receivables, but standard quick ratio includes receivables. Let's compute both ways:\n\n- Quick Assets (including AR) = Cash + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable = 627,601.28 + (-129,032.26) + 13,240.11 + 15,362,611.64 = 15,874,420.77  \n- Quick Assets exclude Inventory = 15,874,420.77  \n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89  \nQuick Ratio = 15,874,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 5.05\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \nThis ratio is similar to Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio. It is defined as  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities  \n= -16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ -5.34\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Return on Equity (ROE)  \nROE = Net Profit / Total Owner's Equity  \n= 1,938,987.47 / 29,938,987.47 ≈ 0.06477 → 6.48%\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover = Total Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n\nSince beginning AR = 0 (as per balance sheet initial), ending AR = 15,362,611.64  \nAverage AR = (0 + 15,362,611.64) / 2 = 7,681,305.82  \n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover = 22,876,677.56 / 7,681,305.82 ≈ 2.98\n\n---\n\n### Final JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-5.34\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.69\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"5.05\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-5.34\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"6.48%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.98\"\n  }\n}\n```",
