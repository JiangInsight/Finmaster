Operating Cash Flow Ratio**\n\nFormula:  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\nCalculation:  \n= -16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ -5.34\n\n---\n\n**2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**\n\nFormula:  \nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Liabilities\n\nTotal Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n\nCalculation:  \n= -16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ -5.34\n\n---\n\n**3. Inventory Turnover Ratio**\n\nFormula:  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nAssuming Inventory at beginning is 0 (from initial balance sheet), Average Inventory = (0 + 6,600,000) / 2 = 3,300,000\n\nCalculation:  \n= 16,400,000 / 3,300,000 ≈ 4.97\n\n---\n\n**4. Debt to Equity Ratio**\n\nFormula:  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n\nCalculation:  \n= 3,143,833.89 / 29,938,987.47 ≈ 0.105\n\n---\n\n**5. Quick Ratio**\n\nFormula:  \nQuick Assets = Cash + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n\nQuick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nCalculate Quick Assets:\n\nCash + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable  \n= 627,601.28 + (-129,032.26) + 13,240.11 + 15,362,611.64  \n= (627,601.28 - 129,032.26) + 13,240.11 + 15,362,611.64  \n= 498,569.02 + 13,240.11 + 15,362,611.64 = 15,874,420.77 (matches Total Current Assets minus Inventory)\n\nCalculate Quick Ratio:\n\n= 15,874,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 5.05\n\n---\n\n**6. Current Ratio**\n\nFormula:  \nCurrent Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\n= 22,474,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 7.15\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-5.34\", \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-5.34\", \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"4.97\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"5.05\", \"Current Ratio\": \"7.15\"}}\n```",
