                        "content": "To identify and extract the specific line items and value of costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver the goods and services to customers, we need to look at the following:\n\n- Costs incurred to secure customer orders are typically found under **Selling Expenses** because these include marketing, sales commissions, advertising, and other costs associated with obtaining customer orders.\n- Costs to deliver goods and services typically correspond to **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** because these include manufacturing or purchase costs, direct labor, and delivery expenses related to the goods/services sold.\n\nFrom the provided income statement:\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 20,200,000.00\n- Selling Expenses = 1,177,105.26\n\nBoth relate to securing orders and delivering goods/services.\n\nThe question is about identifying and extracting the specific line items and value of costs incurred to secure orders and deliver goods/services. It's best to present the total related cost which is the sum of \"Cost of Goods Sold\" and \"Selling Expenses\".\n\nSum = 20,200,000.00 + 1,177,105.26 = 21,377,105.26\n\nHowever, based on the example from instructions, the solution only includes the value of the selling expenses (costs to secure customer orders only). But since the question says \"costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services\", we should provide the relevant combined cost or specify both.\n\nSince the example only extracts selling expenses as costs to secure orders, we will provide the value of **Selling Expenses** as \"costs incurred to secure customer orders\" and the value of **Cost of Goods Sold** as \"costs to deliver goods and services\".\n\nBut the format asks for a single 'value'. Based on the example, they only extract the selling expenses number, which refers to \"costs incurred to secure customer orders\".\n\nSince the question says \"identify and extract the specific line items and value\", I will just provide the sum as the total costs related to securing and delivering.\n\nHence, my final answer will be the sum: 21,377,105.26.\n\nAlternatively, if only one line item is needed per the example, then the best single value to present is the \"Selling Expenses\" as costs to secure orders or \"Cost of Goods Sold\" for delivery.\n\nBut since question asks for both:\n\nI will present the sum of both.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"21377105.26\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\nIf ONLY one value is requested, or to follow example strictly, only selling expenses should be returned:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"1177105.26\"}}\n```\n\nGiven ambiguity, I will pick the combined value as safer, else the example solution is only for selling expenses. Since instructions say \"identify and extract the specific line items and value of costs...\" better to provide both line items separately.\n\nHence I will present both line items and their values:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"20200000.00\", \"Selling Expenses\": \"1177105.26\"}}\n```\n\nBut the instruction wants specifically \"present your answer in the \"solution\" field in the following json format\"\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '______'} }\n```\n\nSingle value only.\n\nTherefore, the best representative of the total costs incurred to secure orders and deliver goods and services is the sum.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"21377105.26\"}}\n```\n\n# Final answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"21377105.26\"}}\n```",
