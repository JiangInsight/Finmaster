Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit (accounts receivable related item) → From the Balance Sheet: **Accounts Receivable** (the end amount).\n2. Financing costs incurred to raise funds for production and operation (financing costs) → From the Income Statement: **Financial Expenses**.\n3. Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets → From the Cash Flow Statement: **Purchase of Fixed Assets** (cash outflow).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: From the Balance Sheet, find the \"Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit.\"  \n- Line item: **Accounts Receivable**  \n- End amount: 14921566.06\n\n### Step 2: From the Income Statement, find \"Financing costs\" or \"Financial Expenses.\"  \n- Line item: **Financial Expenses**  \n- Amount: 372003.12\n\n### Step 3: From the Cash Flow Statement, find cash outflows to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.  \n- Line item: **Purchase of Fixed Assets**  \n- Amount: 2479994.53\n\n---\n\n### Final solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"14921566.06\", \"value2\": \"372003.12\", \"value3\": \"2479994.53\"}}\n```\n  \nThis matches the order requested: Balance Sheet → Income Statement → Cash Flow Statement and maintains the line item order from the input.",
