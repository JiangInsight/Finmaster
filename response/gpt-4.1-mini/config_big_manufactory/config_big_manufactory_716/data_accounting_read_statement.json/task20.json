The carrying amount of inventories sold during the period is generally represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n2. In the provided income statement, the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" has the value 20200000.00.\n\nTherefore, the value we need to extract is 20200000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"20200000.00\"}}\n```",
