The question asks to identify two specific line items from the income statement:\n   - The income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities.\n   - The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\n2. The income from core operating activities usually corresponds to \"Main Business Revenue\" (or sometimes \"Operating Revenue\" or \"Sales Revenue\"), which reflects revenue generated from the core operations.\n\n3. The carrying amount of inventories sold corresponds to \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS), which represents the cost value of goods that were sold.\n\n4. From the problem data:\n\n| Account               | Amount        | Date       |\n|-----------------------|---------------|------------|\n| Main Business Revenue  | 28572608.70   | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Revenue         | 28572608.70   | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold     | 20200000.00   | 2024-02-05 |\n\n5. Therefore:\n   - value1 = \"Main Business Revenue\" amount = 28572608.70\n   - value2 = \"Cost of Goods Sold\" amount = 20200000.00\n\nAnswer should maintain the original line item order.\n\nFinal output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28572608.70', 'value2': '20200000.00'}}\n```",
