Look for tax-related items in the income statement:\n   - Tax Expense: 1,428,630.43\n\n2. Cross-check in Balance Sheet Liabilities for taxes payable:\n   - Taxes Payable: 1,428,630.43\n\n3. The same value appears in both statements and matches the expected tax amount.\n\nThus, the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period is 1,428,630.43.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1428630.43'} }\n```",
