Here, the relevant line item is either \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue\". Both have the same amount of 28572608.70.  \n   We take the first relevant line item \"Main Business Revenue\" with amount 28572608.70.\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period:**  \n   This would typically be the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" or \"Total Cost\" related to inventories sold. Here \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is 20200000.00.\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole:**  \n   Usually this corresponds to \"Administrative Expenses\". Here, \"Administrative Expenses\" is 1544669.73.\n\nThe order to maintain is as per the input statement:\n\n- Main Business Revenue: 28572608.70  \n- Cost of Goods Sold: 20200000.00  \n- Administrative Expenses: 1544669.73  \n\nHence, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28572608.70', 'value2': '20200000.00', 'value3': '1544669.73'} }\n```",
