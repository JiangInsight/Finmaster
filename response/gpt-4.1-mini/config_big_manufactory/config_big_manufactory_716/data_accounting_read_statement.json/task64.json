                        "content": "Let's identify the required values step-by-step:\n\n1. **From Balance Sheet: capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**  \n   - This corresponds to **\"Paid-in Capital\"**.  \n   - The value given is: **28000000.00**\n\n2. **From Income Statement: end value of profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**  \n   - This corresponds to **\"Profit Before Tax\"**.  \n   - The value given is: **5172748.32**\n\n3. **From Balance Sheet: addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**  \n   - This corresponds to **\"Accounts Payable\"** end amount because that represents the liabilities owed to suppliers for goods/services.  \n   - The value given is: **6600000.00**\n\nNote the instruction says to group by financial statement in order:\n1. Balance Sheet  \n2. Income Statement  \n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nBut the third value (increase in amount owed) comes from the Balance Sheet (\"Accounts Payable\"). The Income Statement line is the profit before tax. However, the increase in amount owed corresponds to Accounts Payable in Balance Sheet, not anything additional in the Cash Flow Statement.  \n\nSince the third item is about the increase in amount owed on credit \"during the period,\" the best measure in Balance Sheet is the ending Accounts Payable (assuming beginning was zero, but from table initial amount is zero). Otherwise, sometimes you might find the increase in Accounts Payable in Cash Flow Statement as \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\" But here, the instruction says \"based on all financial statements\" and \"group by financial statement,\" so we take the Accounts Payable from Balance Sheet.\n\nThus:\n\n- Balance Sheet values:  \n  - Paid-in Capital: 28000000.00  \n  - Accounts Payable: 6600000.00  \n\n- Income Statement value:  \n  - Profit Before Tax: 5172748.32  \n\nNo value is requested specifically from Cash Flow Statement based on the problem statement items.\n\nHowever, the instruction says \"For multiple outputs, group them by financial statement in the following order: 1.Balance Sheet 2.Income Statement 3.Cash Flow Statement.\"\n\nThe required three values are:\n- profit or loss before tax (Income Statement)  \n- addition in the amount owed for goods or services on credit (Accounts Payable, Balance Sheet)  \n- capital contributed by shareholders (Paid-in Capital, Balance Sheet)  \n\nBut problem says \"Based on the all financial statements, identify and extract the three specific line items and end value of:  \n1) profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense  \n2) the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period  \n3) capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares.\"  \n\nAnd order output by:  \n1) Balance Sheet  \n2) Income Statement  \n3) Cash Flow Statement  \n\nWithin each group, keep original line item order.\n\nTherefore, the output should be:  \n- Balance Sheet group:  1) addition in amount owed (Accounts Payable) and 2) capital contributed (Paid-in Capital)  \n- Income Statement group: profit before tax  \n- Cash Flow Statement group: none\n\nBut to keep order of original line items and group order, as the problem states:  \n\nSince the problem desires three outputs, and grouping is Balance Sheet first, Income Statement second, and Cash Flow Statement third, within each keeping original line item order shown in input.\n\nSo for Balance Sheet, we have two of the needed values:  \n- Accounts Payable (first)  \n- Paid-in Capital (second)  \n\nBut the problem example only uses one value1 from Balance Sheet (Paid-in Capital), and value3 is the amount owed (Accounts Payable).\n\nLooking carefully at the example:  \nThe example solution:  \n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '-1373590.51', 'value3': '1590000.00'}}  \n\nWhere:  \n- value1 is Paid-in Capital from Balance Sheet  \n- value2 is Profit Before Tax from Income Statement  \n- value3 is Accounts Payable (increase in amount owed) from Balance Sheet\n\nThus, here following the example, the first value is capital contributed by shareholders (Paid-in Capital), second value is profit before tax (Income Statement), third value is addition in amount owed (Accounts Payable).\n\nSo final mapping and order will be:  \n- value1: Paid-in Capital (Balance Sheet) = 28000000.00  \n- value2: Profit Before Tax (Income Statement) = 5172748.32  \n- value3: Accounts Payable (Balance Sheet) = 6600000.00\n\nHence, presented in requested json:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28000000.00', 'value2': '5172748.32', 'value3': '6600000.00'}}\n```\n\n# Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28000000.00', 'value2': '5172748.32', 'value3': '6600000.00'}}\n```",
