From the problem, the relevant activity is the **Cash Flow from Investing Activities**.\n\n2. Within this section, there is one line item:\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 2,479,994.53\n\n3. The net cash flow from investing activities is shown as:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -2,479,994.53 \n\n4. Since only Purchase of Fixed Assets appears, and there is no explicit mention of disposal or receipt of interest/dividends in this statement, the net amount is essentially from \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n\n5. The net cash flow from investing is negative (-2,479,994.53), which aligns with the purchase (cash outflow).\n\n6. Hence, the single sub-item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with value 2,479,994.53 (positive number as in statement).\n\n---\n\n**Final JSON solution:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-2479994.53\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"2479994.53\"}}\n```",
