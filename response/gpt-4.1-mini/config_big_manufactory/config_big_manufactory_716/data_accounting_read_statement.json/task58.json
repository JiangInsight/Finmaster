From the balance sheet, the \"Initial_amount\" as of \"Initial_date\" 2023-12-31 for these line items related to cash and cash equivalents are:\n   - Cash on Hand: 5,000,000.00\n   - Bank Deposits: 15,000,000.00\n\n2. The total cash and cash equivalents at the beginning should be the sum of these relevant line items (usually \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" are considered cash and cash equivalents).\n\n3. Adding these two gives: 5,000,000.00 + 15,000,000.00 = 20,000,000.00\n\n4. This is confirmed by the \"Beginning Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" in the cash flow section, which shows 20,000,000.00 on 2024-02-05.\n\nTherefore, the beginning balance (cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period) is 20,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"20000000.00\"}}\n```",
