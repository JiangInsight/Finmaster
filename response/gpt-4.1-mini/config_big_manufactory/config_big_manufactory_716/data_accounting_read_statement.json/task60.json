Balance Sheet  \n- \"Bank Deposits\" is the line item related to funds deposited into a bank.  \n  Its end value is: 1020005.47  \n\n### 2. Income Statement  \n- The income from financial assets is generally indicated by \"Interest Income\".  \n  The amount here is: 14887.89  \n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement  \n- Not specifically asked for extraction here since the first two are found already. We only extract if present, but here the two relevant line items are already identified above.  \n\nThus, the results are:  \n- value1 (Bank Deposits from Balance Sheet): 1020005.47  \n- value2 (Interest Income from Income Statement): 14887.89  \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"1020005.47\", \"value2\": \"14887.89\"}}\n```",
