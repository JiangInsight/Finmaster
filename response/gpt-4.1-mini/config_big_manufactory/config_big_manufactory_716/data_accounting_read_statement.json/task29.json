The task is to identify and extract the \"total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities\" along with its constituent line items.\n\n2. From the income statement, the key income item that fits this description is \"Total Revenue\" (or it could be \"Main Business Revenue\" if they are the same).\n\n3. Here, \"Total Revenue\" = 28,572,608.70 and \"Main Business Revenue\" = 28,572,608.70. Both values are the same, so \"Total Revenue\" arises completely from \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n\n4. The task also requests decomposition into 1 component sub-item originating from the input statement, with initial and final values of each. Since \"Main Business Revenue\" is the only sub-item making up \"Total Revenue,\" this is our sub-item.\n\n5. The \"initial\" and \"final\" values for this sub-item are the same here, since there's only one period or entry.\n\nTherefore, output as:\n\n{\"solution\": {'value': '28572608.70', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '28572608.70'} }\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"28572608.70\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"28572608.70\"}}\n```",
