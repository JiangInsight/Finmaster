Identify the line item and value of cash held by the entity available for day-to-day operations:\n   - Relevant line items: \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" both represent cash but typically \"Cash on Hand\" is direct cash available.\n   - As per task example, only \"Cash on Hand\" was considered for cash.\n   - So, we take \"Cash on Hand\":\n     - Initial amount: 5,000,000.00\n     - End amount: 6,057,264.53\n\n2. Identify tangible items held for use in production, supply of goods/services, rentals, or admin:\n   - Usually refers to fixed or tangible assets.\n   - In the sample, \"Fixed Assets\" was used.\n   - Here, \"Fixed Assets\":\n     - Initial amount: 8,000,000.00\n     - End amount: 10,479,994.53\n\n3. Identify amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid (taxes payable):\n   - The line item is \"Taxes Payable\":\n     - Initial amount: 0.00\n     - End amount: 1,428,630.43\n\nOutput all values maintaining the original order in which these line items appear in the input:\n- Cash on Hand (line 1)\n- Fixed Assets (line 7)\n- Taxes Payable (line 12)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value1\": \"5000000.00\", \"end valu1\": \"6057264.53\", \"initial value2\": \"8000000.00\", \"end valu2\": \"10479994.53\", \"initial value3\": \"0.00\", \"end valu3\": \"1428630.43\"}}\n```",
