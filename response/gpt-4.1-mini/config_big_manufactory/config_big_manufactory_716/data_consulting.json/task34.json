                        "content": "Let's extract the needed information and calculate each ratio step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n### Given:\n\n#### Balance Sheet (Ending)\n- Total Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43\n- Total Owner's Equity = 31,744,117.89\n- Total Assets = 39,772,748.32\n- Accounts Receivable = 14,921,566.06\n- Inventory = 7,400,000.00\n- Interest Receivable = 14,887.89\n- Cash + Bank Deposits (Cash and Cash equivalents) = 6,057,264.53 + 1,020,005.47 = 7,077,270.00 (matches given in cash flow)\n- Accounts Payable = 6,600,000.00\n- Taxes Payable = 1,428,630.43\n\n#### Cash Flow\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -10,442,735.47\n\n#### Income Statement\n- Net Profit = 3,744,117.89\n- Total Revenue = 28,572,608.70\n\n---\n\n### Calculations:\n\n#### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\n= (-10,442,735.47) / 8,028,630.43  \n≈ -1.301\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\nFormula: Total Debt / Total Owner's Equity  \nNote: Debt = Total Assets - Owner's Equity (or sum of liabilities):\n\nTotal Debt = Total Assets - Owner's Equity = 39,772,748.32 - 31,744,117.89 = 8,028,630.43 (matches Current Liabilities, so no long-term debt stated here)\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = Debt / Equity  \n= 8,028,630.43 / 31,744,117.89  \n≈ 0.253\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nFormula: Total Revenue / Average Total Assets\n\nWe only have ending and initial total assets:\n\nInitial Total Assets = 28,000,000.00  \nEnding Total Assets = 39,772,748.32\n\nAverage Total Assets = (28,000,000 + 39,772,748.32) / 2 = 33,886,374.16\n\nTotal Asset Turnover = 28,572,608.70 / 33,886,374.16 ≈ 0.843\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Quick Ratio\nFormula: (Cash + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable  \n= 6,057,264.53 + 1,020,005.47 + 14,887.89 + 14,921,566.06  \n= 22,013,724\n\nQuick Ratio = 22,013,724 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ 2.74\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n(Same as Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio)\n\n= -1.301 (same calculation as #1)\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\nFormula: Net Profit / Average Owner's Equity\n\nInitial Owner's Equity = 28,000,000.00  \nEnding Owner's Equity = 31,744,117.89\n\nAverage Owner's Equity = (28,000,000 + 31,744,117.89) / 2 = 29,872,058.95\n\nROE = 3,744,117.89 / 29,872,058.95 ≈ 0.1253 or 12.53%\n\n---\n\n#### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nFormula: Net Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nInitial Accounts Receivable = 0.00  \nEnding Accounts Receivable = 14,921,566.06\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable = (0 + 14,921,566.06)/2 = 7,460,783.03\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover = 28,572,608.70 / 7,460,783.03 ≈ 3.83\n\n---\n\n### Final answers rounded to two decimals (ratios) and ROE in percentage with two decimals:\n\n- Operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio: -1.30\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.25\n- Total Asset Turnover Ratio: 0.84\n- Quick Ratio: 2.74\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -1.30\n- Return on Equity (ROE): 12.53%\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: 3.83\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.30\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.25\", \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.84\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"2.74\", \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.30\", \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"12.53%\", \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.83\"}}\n```",
