Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities  \n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Liabilities  \n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  \n4. Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity  \n5. Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities  \n6.
