paid purchases reduce cash and count as assets instead.\n\nSince purchases do not reduce owner's equity directly (only affect assets and liabilities), we don't subtract these.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Calculate final owner's equity\n\nOwner's equity end ≈ 28,000,000 + 26,965,638.54 = 54,965,638.54\n\n---\n\n### But this result is too high and different from sample format.\n\n---\n\n### Reconsidering Methodology:\n\nIn typical balance sheet format:\n\nOwner's equity = Assets - Liabilities\n\nAssets include cash, bank, fixed assets, accounts receivable, etc.\n\nLiabilities include accounts payable, unpaid purchases, etc.\n\nSo let's try:\n\n**Initial Owner's Equity**\n\nGiven initial assets (cash deposit + bank deposit + fixed assets):\n\n5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 28,000,000\n\nAssuming no initial liabilities mentioned -> Owner's equity = 28,000,000\n\n---\n\n**Ending Owner's Equity**\n\nCalculate:\n\n- Ending Assets:\n\n  - Initial assets + purchases (paid) + sales (accounts receivable and cash increases) - expenses - depreciation.\n\n- Ending Liabilities:\n\n  - Unpaid purchases\n\n---\n\nCalculate total purchases paid and unpaid:\n\n- Purchases Paid (Purchase with payment status \"Paid\"):\n\n  Sum of purchase amounts with payment_status=\"Paid\":\n\n  From data:\n\n  Purchase20231231001 - Paid - 1,000,000.0  \n  Purchase20231231003 - Paid - 1,000,000.0  \n  Purchase20231231004 - Paid - 1,500,000.0  \n  Purchase20231231005 - Paid - 3,000,000.0  \n  Purchase20231231006 - Paid - 1,600,000.0  \n  Purchase20231231007 - Paid - 800,000.0  \n  Purchase20231231009 - Paid - 1,600,000.0  \n  Purchase20231231010 - Paid - 1,500,000.0  \n  Purchase20231231011 - Paid - 500,000.0  \n  Purchase20231231013 - Paid - 500,000.0  \n  Purchase20231231014 - Paid - 1,500,000.0  \n  Purchase20231231015 - Paid - 3,000,000.0  \n  Purchase20231231016 - Paid - 2,000,000.0  \n  Purchase20231231017 - Paid - 1,500,000.0  \n\nSum paid purchases (approx):\n\n1 + 1 + 1.5 + 3 + 1.6 + 0.8 + 1.6 + 1.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 3 + 2 + 1.5 = \n\n= 1 + 1 = 2  \n2 + 1.5 = 3.5  \n3.5 + 3 = 6.5  \n6.5 + 1.6 = 8.1  \n8.1 + 0.8 = 8.9  \n8.9 + 1.6 = 10.5  \n10.5 + 1.5 = 12  \n12 + 0.5 = 12.5  \n12.5 + 0.5 = 13  \n13 + 1.5 =14.5  \n14.5 + 3 = 17.5  \n17.5 + 2 = 19.5  \n19.5 + 1.5 = 21 million approx.\n\n---\n\n- Purchases Unpaid (account payable)\n\nCheck unpaid purchases:\n\nPurchase20231231002 - Unpaid - 1,000,000.0  \nPurchase20231231006 (Not unpaid)  \nPurchase20231231008 - Unpaid - 1,000,000.0  \nPurchase20231231012 - Unpaid - 1,600,000.0  \nPurchase20231231018 - Unpaid - 3,000,000.0  \n\nApprox sum unpaid:\n\n1 + 1 + 1.6 + 3 = 6.6 million approximately\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Calculate total Current Assets and Fixed Assets at end\n\n- Initial assets 28 mil + paid purchases (21 mil) + sales revenue accounted as cash/accounts receivable (but sales increase cash/accounts receivable)\n\nSales are revenue, not assets directly.
