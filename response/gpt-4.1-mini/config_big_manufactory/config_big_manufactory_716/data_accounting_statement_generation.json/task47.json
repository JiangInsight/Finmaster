                        "content": "To calculate the final ending cash and cash equivalents balance, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify initial cash and bank deposits (which are cash equivalents).\n2. Add cash inflows (cash receipts or cash sales collected in cash).\n3. Subtract cash outflows (cash payments or expenses paid in cash).\n4. Consider cash transfers between cash and bank accounts as internal transfers (no net impact on total cash and cash equivalents).\n5. Ignore paid/unpaid status for valuation of cash on hand; only consider actual cash payment or receipt transactions marked as \"Cash\" payment_method and \"Paid\" status cash inflows and outflows.\n6. Ignore non-cash transactions (e.g., depreciation, interest unpaid entries, accounts receivable payments not paid in cash, and fixed assets purchases paid via bank transfer as not affecting cash balance directly).\n7. Focus on transactions with payment_method \"Cash\" and payment/receipt_status \"Paid\", which affect cash on hand.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Balance\n\n- Cash deposit: 5,000,000.0\n- Bank deposit: 15,000,000.0\n\n**Initial cash and cash equivalents** = 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 = 20,000,000.00\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Add cash inflows (Receipts, Sales received in cash)\n\nLook for sales or receipts with payment_method = \"Cash\" and payment/receipt_status = \"Paid\" and payment_method present:\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- No explicit \"payment_method\" for sales, except for some indicating cash in \"receive_method\" or other fields.\n\nReview sales with \"receive_method\" or payment_method as \"Cash\" or sales marked as paid and amount presumed received in cash.\n\nBut in provided entries, \"payment_method\" is mostly blank except for expenses and purchases.\n\n- Cash to bank or bank to cash transfers do not affect overall cash and cash equivalents total (internal movement) - accounted for.\n\n- Consider only expenses paid by cash and purchases paid by cash for outflows.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Identify Cash Outflows\n\nSum all amounts with payment/receipt_status = \"Paid\" and payment_method = \"Cash\"\n\nWe parse overview of expenses paid in cash:\n\nFrom the dataset:\n\n| amount        | description                     | payment_method | payment/receipt_status |\n|---------------|--------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|\n| 46517.71      | Administrative Expenses        | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 83454.23      | Administrative Expenses        | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 33781.67      | Administrative Expenses        | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 32999.84      | Administrative Expenses        | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 1500000.0     | Purchase Heavy Equipment D     | Cash           | Paid                  | <-- identified in Purchase20231231004\n| 19956.10      | Sales Expenses                 | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 66794.44      | Sales Expenses                 | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 10564.48      | Administrative Expenses        | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 76852.11      | Administrative Expenses        | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 34107.04      | Sales Expenses                 | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 79293.14      | Administrative Expenses        | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 25553.99      | Admin+Sales Expenses (to be summed individually) | Cash | Paid      |\n| 39891.05      | Administrative Expenses        | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 28346.48      | Sales Expenses                 | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 28346.48      | Sales Expenses (included above) | Cash         | Paid                  |\n| 60968.71      | Sales Expenses                 | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 10275.59      | Administrative Expenses        | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 25487.02      | Administrative Expenses        | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 66912.09      | Financial Expenses             | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 33141.79      | Administrative Expenses        | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 60049.63      | Financial Expenses             | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 51086.01      | Sales Expenses                 | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 52391.74      | Financial Expenses             | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 90795.92      | Administrative Expenses        | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 69569.7       | Financial Expenses             | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 78951.08      | Administrative Expenses        | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 39097.33      | Administrative Expenses        | Cash           | Paid                  |\n| 61926.77      | Sale?

For these, amounts to add to cash.\n\n- Similarly, payments made in cash (expenses, purchases) must be subtracted.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Extract cash sales received\n\nLook for sales with \"payment/receipt_status\" = \"Paid\" and \"receive_method\" = \"Cash\":\n\nFrom problem dataset:\n\n- Sale20240103001 : Sale (paid, receive_method empty, ignore as no cash)\n- Sale20240109007 : Sale (unpaid, no cash)\n- Sale20240110009 : Sale, payment/receipt_status Paid, receive_method empty but payment_method blank, ignore\n\nLook for sales with some \"receive_method\" = \"Cash\" and Paid:\n\n- No clear entries with receive_method = \"Cash\" and Paid in sales.\n\nHence assume sales proceeds are bank deposits unless explicitly cash.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Identify purchases/expenses paid in cash (cash outflows):\n\nSum amounts with payment_method = \"Cash\" and payment/receipt_status = \"Paid\":\n\nScan the specific expenses marked paid in cash:\n\nExpenses paid in cash:\n\n- 46517.71\n- 83454.23\n- 33781.67\n- 32999.84\n- 19956.10\n- 66794.44\n- 10564.48\n- 76852.11\n- 34107.04\n- 79293.14\n- 57454.13\n- 28346.48\n- 60968.71\n- 10275.59\n- 25487.02\n- 66912.09\n- 33141.79\n- 60049.63\n- 51086.01\n- 52391.74\n- 90795.92\n- 69569.70\n- 78951.08\n- 39097.33\n- 57454.13\n\nSum these:\n\n46517.71  \n+ 83454.23 = 129971.94  \n+ 33781.67 = 163753.61  \n+ 32999.84 = 196753.45  \n+ 19956.10 = 216709.55  \n+ 66794.44 = 283503.99  \n+ 10564.48 = 294068.47  \n+ 76852.11 = 371920.58  \n+ 34107.04 = 406027.62  \n+ 79293.14 = 485320.76  \n+ 57454.13 = 542774.89  \n+ 28346.48 = 571121.37  \n+ 60968.71 = 632090.08  \n+ 10275.59 = 642365.67  \n+ 25487.02 = 667852.69  \n+ 66912.09 = 734764.78  \n+ 33141.79 = 767906.57  \n+ 60049.63 = 827956.20  \n+ 51086.01 = 879042.21  \n+ 52391.74 = 931433.95  \n+ 90795.92 = 1024230.87  \n+ 69569.70 = 1093800.57  \n+ 78951.08 = 1172751.65  \n+ 39097.33 = 1211848.98  \n+ 57454.13 = 1269303.11  \n\nTotal expenses paid in cash = approximately 1,269,303.11\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Identify purchases paid in cash (not bank transfer):\n\nPurchases with payment_method = \"Cash\" and Paid:\n\n- Purchase20231231004: 1,500,000.0 Paid in Cash (already counted)\n- Purchase20231231016: 2,000,000.0 Paid in Cash (included?)\n- Others mostly bank transfer.\n\nFrom purchases:\n\n- Purchase20231231004 (Heavy Equipment D): 1,500,000 Paid in Cash\n- Purchase20231231016 (Heavy Equipment C): 2,000,000 Paid in Cash\n\nSum purchases paid in cash:  \n1,500,000 + 2,000,000 = 3,500,000\n\nAdd to expenses paid in cash = 1,269,303.11\n\nTotal cash outflow = 3,500,000 + 1,269,303.11 = 4,769,303.11\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Find transfers between bank and cash:\n\nTransfers (cash to bank or bank to cash):\n\nFrom data:\n\n- Several transfers of 1,000,000 amounts, both \"Bank to cash\" and \"Cash to bank\".\n\nSince these cancel out for total cash and cash equivalents, no net effect.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Calculate inflows:\n\n- No clear cash inflow from sales marked as cash.\n\n- Initial cash was 5,000,000 (cash) + 15,000,000 (bank) = 20,000,000\n\n- No cash sale receipts to add.\n\n- Some transfers from bank to cash do add to cash, but total cash+bank combined unaffected.\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: Final calculation:\n\nInitial total cash and bank = 20,000,000\n\nSubtract cash expenses and cash purchases = 4,769,303.11\n\nNo cash sales collected in cash explicitly indicated.\n\n---\n\n### Ending cash and cash equivalents = 20,000,000 - 4,769,303.11 = 15,230,696.89\n\nRounded to two decimals: 15,230,696.89\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"15230696.89\"}}\n```",
