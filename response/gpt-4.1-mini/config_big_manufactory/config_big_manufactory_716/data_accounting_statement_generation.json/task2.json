So, consider:\n- Purchases or fixed asset purchases paid by \"Bank Transfer\" reduce bank deposits (outflows).\n- Sales or other receipts received directly into the bank increase bank deposits (but sales mostly show no direct payment method or not specified as bank deposit).\n- Transfers from bank to cash reduce bank deposits.\n- Transfers from cash to bank increase bank deposits.\n\nWe will scan the data to find transactions affecting bank deposit balances:\n\n**Identify bank deposit decreases (outflows):**\n- Purchases paid by Bank Transfer reduce bank deposits.\n- Fixed assets paid by Bank Transfer reduce bank deposits.\n- Transfers \"Bank to cash transfer\" reduce bank deposits.\n- Other expenses paid by Bank Transfer reduce bank deposits (none explicitly listed).\n\n**Identify bank deposit increases (inflows):**\n- Transfers \"Cash to bank transfer\" increase bank deposits.\n- Sales receipts paid by Bank Transfer? No sales mention bank transfer, typically cash or account receivable.\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- Initial Bank Deposit: 15,000,000.0\n\n- Purchases paid by Bank Transfer:\n  - Purchase20231231001: 1,000,000.0 (Paid: Bank Transfer)\n  - FixedAsset20231231001: 758,493.61 (Paid: Bank Transfer)\n  - Purchase20231231003: 1,000,000.0 (Paid: Bank Transfer)\n  - Purchase20231231006: 800,000.0 (Paid: Bank Transfer)\n  - Purchase20231231007: 500,000.0 (Paid: Bank Transfer - Unpaid, no)\n  - Purchase20231231009: 1,600,000.0 (Paid: Bank Transfer)\n  - Purchase20231231010: 1,500,000.0 (Paid: Bank Transfer)\n  - Purchase20231231011: 500,000.0 (Paid: Bank Transfer)\n  - Purchase20231231014: 1,500,000.0 (Paid: Bank Transfer)\n  - Purchase20231231015: 1,500,000.0 (Paid: Bank Transfer)\n  - Purchase20231231017: 1,500,000.0 (Paid: Bank Transfer)\n\n(Note: Only those marked \"Paid\" and with \"Bank Transfer\" payment method count as bank outflows.)\n\nCalculate total bank transfer payments:\n\nSum these:\n\n1,000,000.0 + 758,493.61 + 1,000,000.0 + 800,000.0 + 1,600,000.0 + 1,500,000.0 + 500,000.0 + 1,500,000.0 + 1,500,000.0 + 1,500,000.0 + 1,500,000.0 = \n\nLet's sum stepwise:\n\n- 1,000,000.0\n- + 758,493.61 = 1,758,493.61\n- + 1,000,000.0 = 2,758,493.61\n- + 800,000.0 = 3,558,493.61\n- + 1,600,000.0 = 5,158,493.61\n- + 1,500,000.0 = 6,658,493.61\n- + 500,000.0 = 7,158,493.61\n- + 1,500,000.0 = 8,658,493.61\n- + 1,500,000.0 = 10,158,493.61\n- + 1,500,000.0 = 11,658,493.61\n- + 1,500,000.0 = 13,158,493.61\n\nTotal bank transfer outflows: 13,158,493.61\n\n**Transfers \"Bank to cash transfer\" (reduce bank deposits):**\n\n- Transfer20240105001: 1,000,000.0\n- Transfer20240108001: 1,000,000.0\n\nTotal bank to cash transfers: 2,000,000.0\n\nAdd this to total outflows:\n\n13,158,493.61 + 2,000,000.0 = 15,158,493.61\n\n**Transfers \"Cash to bank transfer\" (increase bank deposits):**\n\n- Transfer20240121001: 1,000,000.0\n- Transfer20240124001: 1,000,000.0\n- Transfer20240124001 (duplicate date/ID but separate entry): 1,000,000.0\n- Transfer20240125001: 1,000,000.0\n- Transfer20240125001 (duplicate): 1,000,000.0\n- Transfer20240127001: 1,000,000.0\n- Transfer20240127001 (multiple entries on same date):\n  There are 4 occurrences listed (all 1000000.0): total 4,000,000.0\n- Transfer20240131001: 1,000,000.0\n\nTotal cash to bank transfers:\n\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11,000,000.0\n\nAdd this to inflows: 11,000,000.0\n\n**Note: There are some purchase payments marked as \"Unpaid\" with payment method \"Account Payable\", so they do not affect bank deposits immediately.**\n\n**Summary so far:**\n\nInitial bank deposit: 15,000,000.0\n\nLess total bank transfer outflows + bank to cash transfers: 15,158,493.61\n\nAdd cash to bank transfers: 11,000,000.0\n\nNet bank deposit balance = 15,000,000.0 - 15,158,493.61 + 11,000,000.0 = 10,841,506.39\n\n**Step 3: Account for other inflows or outflows directly related to bank deposit**\n\nSales receipts paid in cash or unpaid do not add to bank deposits.\n\nNo other direct bank deposit inflows or outflows specified in the data.\n\nExpenses mostly paid in cash, so no effect on bank deposits.\n\n**Step 4: Cross-verify with any directly recorded bank deposit adjustments**\n\nNo explicitly recorded ending balance given, so using net calculation as above.\n\n---\n\n**Final results:**\n\n- Bank Deposits Initial Value: 15000000.00\n\n- Bank Deposits End Value: 10841506.39\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"15000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"10841506.39\"}}\n```",
