Identify the initial fixed assets value from the initial records as of 2023-12-31.\n2. Sum all fixed assets purchases made after the initial date.\n3. Subtract accumulated depreciation to find the ending fixed assets net value.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Initial Fixed Assets**\n\n- From the initial entry on 2023-12-31, the fixed assets amount is: **8,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Fixed Assets Purchases**\n\n- FixedAsset purchase entries labeled with type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" and with amounts on or after 2023-12-31:\n  - 2023-12-31: 758,493.61 (Production Line Equipment)\n  - 2023-12-31: 1,721,500.92 (Industrial Facilities)\n\nTotal fixed assets purchase = 758,493.61 + 1,721,500.92 = **2,479,994.53**\n\n- There are also purchases with type \"Purchase\" referring to heavy equipment products, but these are inventory or other assets, not fixed assets purchases. Only records with type or description related to \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or asset types should be included.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Depreciation**\n\n- Depreciation amounts (accumulated depreciation) after initial date to subtract from fixed assets:\n  - 2024-01-01: 45,749.96\n  - 2024-02-01: 75,220.20\n\nTotal depreciation = 45,749.96 + 75,220.20 = **120,970.16**\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Ending Fixed Assets**\n\nEnding Fixed Assets = Initial Fixed Assets + Fixed Assets Purchases - Depreciation  \n= 8,000,000.00 + 2,479,994.53 - 120,970.16  \n= 10,359,024.37\n\nRounding to two decimals: 10,359,024.37\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"10359024.37\"}}\n```",
