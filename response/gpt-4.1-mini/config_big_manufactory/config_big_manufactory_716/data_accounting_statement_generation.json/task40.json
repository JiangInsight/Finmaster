Identify the inventory relevant transactions:\n   - Purchases increase inventory (cash outflow, so increase in inventory is a use of cash).\n   - Sales decrease inventory (cash inflow, sales reduce inventory cost, so decrease in inventory).\n\n2. Since the question requires the change in inventory for the cash flow statement, the amount is:\n   (Purchases amount) - (Cost of goods sold or cost amount related to sales)\n\n3. We'll consider only transactions related to inventory (products with product_id and product_name) that affect inventory value: Purchases and Sales.\n\n4. Sum up total inventory purchases (cost amounts for purchases).\n\n5. Sum up total inventory sales cost amounts.\n\n6. Calculate the net increase (purchases - sales cost).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Extract Purchases\n\nLook for entries with type \"Purchase\" and extract their \"amount\" or \"cost_per_unit\" * \"quantity\" or just \"amount\" since amount corresponds to purchase cost.\n\nFrom the given data, relevant purchase transactions are:\n\n- Purchase20231231001 (P003): 1 unit, amount 1,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231002 (P003): 1 unit, amount 1,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231003 (P004): 1 unit, amount 1,500,000.0\n- Purchase20231231005 (P004): 2 units, amount 3,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231006 (P002): 2 units, amount 1,600,000.0\n- Purchase20231231007 (P002): 1 unit, amount 800,000.0\n- Purchase20231231008 (P001): 2 units, amount 1,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231009 (P002): 2 units, amount 1,600,000.0\n- Purchase20231231010 (P004): 1 unit, amount 1,500,000.0\n- Purchase20231231011 (P003): 2 units, amount 2,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231012 (P002): 2 units, amount 1,600,000.0\n- Purchase20231231013 (P001): 1 unit, amount 500,000.0\n- Purchase20231231014 (P004): 1 unit, amount 1,500,000.0\n- Purchase20231231015 (P004): 2 units, amount 3,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231016 (P003): 2 units, amount 2,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231017 (P004): 1 unit, amount 1,500,000.0\n- Purchase20231231018 (P004): 2 units, amount 3,000,000.0\n\nSum of purchase amounts:\n\n- 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 3,000,000 + 1,600,000 + 800,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,600,000 + 1,500,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,600,000 + 500,000 + 1,500,000 + 3,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 3,000,000\n\nCalculating the sum:\n\n1,000,000  \n+ 1,000,000 = 2,000,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 3,500,000  \n+ 3,000,000 = 6,500,000  \n+ 1,600,000 = 8,100,000  \n+ 800,000 = 8,900,000  \n+ 1,000,000 = 9,900,000  \n+ 1,600,000 = 11,500,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 13,000,000  \n+ 2,000,000 = 15,000,000  \n+ 1,600,000 = 16,600,000  \n+ 500,000 = 17,100,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 18,600,000  \n+ 3,000,000 = 21,600,000  \n+ 2,000,000 = 23,600,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 25,100,000  \n+ 3,000,000 = 28,100,000\n\nTotal Purchases = 28,100,000.0\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Extract Cost of Goods Sold (from Sales)\n\nSales reduce inventory. The cost associated with sales is the \"cost_amount\" in the sales transactions.\n\nFrom sales transactions, relevant cost_amount values are:\n\n- Sale20240103001 (P003): 1,000,000.0\n- Sale20240106004 (P002): 800,000.0\n- Sale20240107006 (P004): 1,500,000.0\n- Sale20240109007 (P002): 800,000.0\n- Sale20240110009 (P002): 800,000.0\n- Sale20240113011 (P004): 1,500,000.0\n- Sale20240117016 (P001): 500,000.0\n- Sale20240118017 (P002): 800,000.0\n- Sale20240119019 (P004): 1,500,000.0\n- Sale20240120020 (P001): 500,000.0\n- Sale20240121022 (P004): 1,500,000.0\n- Sale20240124024 (P003): 1,000,000.0\n- Sale20240128030 (P004): 1,500,000.0\n- Sale20240130032 (P004): 1,500,000.0\n- Sale20240124024 repeated? No duplicate here.\n- Sale20240113011 (P004) noted already.\n\nSum all unique sales cost_amount:\n\n1,000,000  \n+ 800,000 = 1,800,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 3,300,000  \n+ 800,000 = 4,100,000  \n+ 800,000 = 4,900,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 6,400,000  \n+ 500,000 = 6,900,000  \n+ 800,000 = 7,700,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 9,200,000  \n+ 500,000 = 9,700,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 11,200,000  \n+1,000,000 = 12,200,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 13,700,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 15,200,000  \n\nNote that the last sale20240130032 1,500,000 is included.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\n\nChange in Inventory = Purchases - Cost of Goods Sold (inventory sold)\n\n= 28,100,000 - 15,200,000\n\n= 12,900,000\n\nFor cash flow statement, inventory increase is shown as a negative cash flow (uses cash), so the sign is negative:\n\n**(Increase) Decrease in Inventory = -12,900,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-12900000.00\"}}\n```",
