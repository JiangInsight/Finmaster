                        "content": "To calculate the final net cash flows from investing activities, we need to consider cash inflows and outflows related to investing activities such as purchase and sale of fixed assets.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify investing activities\n\nInvesting activities typically include:\n\n- Purchase of fixed assets (cash outflow)\n- Sale of fixed assets (cash inflow)\n- Other investments (not present here)\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify relevant transactions in the provided data\n\nLook for transactions with:\n\n- Type related to Fixed Assets Purchase or similar.\n- Payment status \"Paid\" for cash outflows.\n- Sales of fixed assets (sales of heavy equipment are typically operating activities for sales of finished goods, hence should not be counted as investing - only purchases and sales of fixed assets count).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Extract Fixed Asset Purchases (Investing cash outflow)\n\nFrom data:\n\n- FixedAsset20231231001: Fixed Assets Purchase, 758,493.61 (Paid, Bank Transfer) - outflow\n- FixedAsset20231231001: Fixed Assets Purchase, 1,721,500.92 (Paid, Bank Transfer) - outflow\n- FixedAsset20231231001: Fixed Assets Purchase, 1,721,500.92 already counted? Only one entry with this amount, so 1,721,500.92 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n- FixedAsset20231231001: Fixed Assets Purchase, 1,721,500.92 counted once only.\n- FixedAsset20231231001: Fixed Assets Purchase, 758,493.61 counted once.\n- FixedAsset20231231001: Fixed Assets Purchase, 1,721,500.92 counted once.\n\nNote: Only two fixed asset purchases appear:\n\n- 758,493.61 (Paid)\n- 1,721,500.92 (Paid)\n\nSum of fixed asset purchases (cash outflow): 758,493.61 + 1,721,500.92 = 2,479,994.53\n\nNo fixed asset sales (inflows) are shown in the table.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Verify if there are any sales of fixed assets (investing inflows)\n\nThere is no clear \"Sale of fixed assets\" or similar transaction.\n\nOther sales labeled \"Sale\" relate to sales of products (heavy equipment or similar), which are operating activities, not investing.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Calculate net cash flow from investing activities\n\n- Cash outflow = total paid fixed assets purchases = 2,479,994.53\n- Cash inflow = 0\n\nNet cash flow from investing activities = 0 - 2,479,994.53 = -2,479,994.53\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-2479994.53\"}}\n````",
