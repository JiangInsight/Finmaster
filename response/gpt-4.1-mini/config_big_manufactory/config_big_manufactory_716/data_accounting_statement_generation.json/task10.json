These increase the fixed assets value.  \n\n- FixedAsset20231231001 (Fixed Assets Purchase):  \n  - 758,493.61 (Production Line Equipment4)  \n  - 1,721,500.92 (Industrial Facilities5)  \n\nThese are clear fixed asset purchases and should be added.\n\n- Purchases of heavy equipment (product_name starting with \"Heavy Equipment\" or related to asset_types in asset_type or asset_name) represent asset additions; purchases of \"Heavy Equipment\" should be considered as adding to non-current assets since these are property, plant or equipment.\n\nList of purchase amounts with product_name related to heavy equipment or asset-type indicative:  \n- Purchase20231231001: 1,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment C) - Paid  \n- Purchase20231231002: 1,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment C) - Unpaid (should only consider paid or actually acquired?
