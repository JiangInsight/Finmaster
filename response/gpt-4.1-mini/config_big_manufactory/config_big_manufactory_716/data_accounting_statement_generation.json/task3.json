No explicit inventory initial value was given, so the initial inventory value is **0**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Inventory Changes via Purchases and Sales**  \n- Inventory increases with purchases (product type assets) and decreases with sales.  \n- We need to sum purchase amounts (for products), and subtract cost_amount related to sales to get ending inventory value based on these transactions.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate total purchase value of inventory items (products)**  \nLook for all purchase entries with product_id and product_name, sum their amount values:\n\nPurchases (type=Purchase) with product_id and amount:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 1 unit of P003 amount 1,000,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231002: 1 unit of P003 amount 1,000,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231003: 1 unit of P004 amount 1,500,000.0 (incorrect, verify below)  \n  (No P004 purchase20231231003, corrected below:)  \n  Actually:  \n  - Purchase20231231002: P003 (Heavy Equipment C) 1 unit at 1,000,000.0  \n  - Purchase20231231003: P003 Heavy Equipment C 1,000,000.0  \n  - Purchase20231231004: P004 Heavy Equipment D 1,500,000.0  \n  And so on.\n\nFrom the problem data:  \nPurchases:  \n| id | product_id | quantity | amount |  \n| --- | --- | --- | --- |  \n| Purchase20231231001 | P003 | 1 | 1000000.0 |  \n| Purchase20231231002 | P003 | 1 | 1000000.0 | (Unpaid)  \n| Purchase20231231003 | P003 | 1 | 1000000.0 | (Paid)  \n| Purchase20231231004 | P004 | 1 | 1500000.0 |  \n| Purchase20231231005 | P004 | 2 | 3000000.0 |  \n| Purchase20231231006 | P002 | 2 | 1600000.0 |  \n| Purchase20231231007 | P002 | 1 | 800000.0 |  \n| Purchase20231231008 | P001 | 2 | 1000000.0 | (Unpaid)  \n| Purchase20231231009 | P001 | 1 | 500000.0 |  \n| Purchase20231231010 | P004 | 1 | 1500000.0 |  \n| Purchase20231231011 | P003 | 2 | 2000000.0 |  \n| Purchase20231231012 | P002 | 2 | 1600000.0 | (Unpaid)  \n| Purchase20231231013 | P001 | 1 | 500000.0 |  \n| Purchase20231231014 | P004 | 1 | 1500000.0 |  \n| Purchase20231231015 | P004 | 2 | 3000000.0 |  \n| Purchase20231231016 | P003 | 2 | 2000000.0 |  \n| Purchase20231231017 | P004 | 1 | 1500000.0 |\n\nSum purchase amounts including both Paid and Unpaid as inventory acquisition:  \nSum all Purchase amounts:  \n1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 3,000,000 + 1,600,000 + 800,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 1,500,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,600,000 + 500,000 + 1,500,000 + 3,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,500,000\n\nCalculate:  \n1,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 2,000,000  \n2,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 3,000,000  \n3,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 4,500,000  \n4,500,000 + 3,000,000 = 7,500,000  \n7,500,000 + 1,600,000 = 9,100,000  \n9,100,000 + 800,000 = 9,900,000  \n9,900,000 + 1,000,000 = 10,900,000  \n10,900,000 + 500,000 = 11,400,000  \n11,400,000 + 1,500,000 = 12,900,000  \n12,900,000 + 2,000,000 = 14,900,000  \n14,900,000 + 1,600,000 = 16,500,000  \n16,500,000 + 500,000 = 17,000,000  \n17,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 18,500,000  \n18,500,000 + 3,000,000 = 21,500,000  \n21,500,000 + 2,000,000 = 23,500,000  \n23,500,000 + 1,500,000 = 25,000,000  \n\n**Total Purchases = 25,000,000.0**\n\n**Step 4: Total Sales Cost (Cost of goods sold)**  \nSum the cost_amount for sales entries related to products:  \nSale rows have cost_amount and product_id.
