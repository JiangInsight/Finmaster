Cash receipts from sales (only those that are \"Paid\" or actually received in cash/bank).\n2. Cash payments for purchases that are \"Paid\" (goods and services).\n3. Cash payments for operating expenses (administrative expenses, sales expenses, financial expenses) that are \"Paid\".\n4. Cash received or paid for interest received/paid related to operating activities.\n5. Adjustments for non-cash items such as depreciation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify relevant operating cash inflows\n- Sales revenue cash inflows (only \"Paid\" sales receive cash, \"Unpaid\" are receivables and do not form immediate cash inflow).\n- Also, we do NOT consider any asset purchases or transfers here (those are investing or financing activities).\n\n### Step 2: Identify operating cash outflows\n- Purchases that are \"Paid\" (payment method Bank Transfer or Cash).\n- All operating expenses that are \"Paid\" overall (Administrative, Sales, Financial expenses).\n- Interest received or paid that is related to operating activities (usually, interest received is operating cash inflow, but here they are \"Unpaid\" so no cash inflow).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Adjust for non-cash items\n- Add back depreciation because it is a non-cash expense.\n\n---\n\nLet's analyze given data (from the problem dataset):\n\n---\n\n#### Initial deposits (not operating cash flows):\n- Cash deposit: 5,000,000 (ignore, financing or investing)\n- Bank deposit: 15,000,000 (ignore)\n- Fixed Assets: 8,000,000 (investing activity, ignore)\n\n---\n\n#### Purchases (only consider Paid for operating cash outflows)\n- Purchase entries with \"Paid\" status are cash outflows for inventory etc.\n- Purchase20231231001: 1,000,000 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231003: 1,000,000 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231004: 1,500,000 (Paid, Cash)\n- Purchase20231231005: 3,000,000 (Paid, Cash)\n- Purchase20231231006: 1,600,000 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231007: 500,000 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231008: 800,000 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231009: 1,600,000 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231010: 1,500,000 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231011: 500,000 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231012: Unpaid (skip)\n- Purchase20231231013: 500,000 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231014: 1,500,000 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231015: 3,000,000 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231016: 2,000,000 (Paid, Cash)\n- Purchase20231231017: 1,500,000 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n\nSum Paid Purchases:\n1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 3,000,000 + 1,600,000 + 500,000 + 800,000 + 1,600,000 + 1,500,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 + 1,500,000 + 3,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,500,000\n\nLet's total those:\n\n- 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 2,000,000  \n- 2,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 3,500,000  \n- 3,500,000 + 3,000,000 = 6,500,000  \n- 6,500,000 + 1,600,000 = 8,100,000  \n- 8,100,000 + 500,000 = 8,600,000  \n- 8,600,000 + 800,000 = 9,400,000  \n- 9,400,000 + 1,600,000 = 11,000,000  \n- 11,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 12,500,000  \n- 12,500,000 + 500,000 = 13,000,000  \n- 13,000,000 + 500,000 = 13,500,000  \n- 13,500,000 + 1,500,000 = 15,000,000  \n- 15,000,000 + 3,000,000 = 18,000,000  \n- 18,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 20,000,000  \n- 20,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 21,500,000\n\n**Total Purchases Paid = 21,500,000**\n\n---\n\n#### Operating Expenses Paid (Administrative, Sales, Financial Expenses)\n\nSum the \"Paid\" expenses:\n\nFrom expenses (only Paid status and amounts):\n\n- 46,517.71  \n- 83,454.23  \n- 33,781.67  \n- 32,999.84  \n- 76,455.38  \n- 19,956.10  \n- 66,794.44  \n- 88,987.43  \n- 41,863.27  \n- 10,564.48  \n- 76,852.11  \n- 28,346.48  \n- 41,705.41  \n- 69,032.68  \n- 50,086.01  \n- 52,391.74  \n- 90,795.92  \n- 69,569.70  \n- 79,898.85  \n- 70,987.96  \n- 33,141.79  \n- 60,049.63  \n- 51,086.01 (appears same code repeated, take once in sum)  \n- 50,086.01 repeated?
