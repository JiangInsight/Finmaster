Still, interest receivables with positive amounts increase earnings.\n\n#### Expenses:\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Sales Expenses\n- Financial Expenses\n- Depreciation\n\n---\n\n### Extract and sum all components (based on provided data):\n\n#### Initial Retained Earnings:\n= 0.00\n\n---\n\n#### Revenues Calculation:\n\nSum profit column (only from sales):\n\nFrom each \"Sale\" record:\n- profit values are:\n  - 411983.38\n  - 380660.04\n  - 683357.44\n  - 220191.63\n  - 306030.68\n  - 568407.48\n  - 221719.53\n  - 264438.17\n  - 697737.08\n  - 455453.32\n  - 696931.90\n  - 601413.12\n  - 384684.30\n  - 220191.63 (listed again?), NO.
