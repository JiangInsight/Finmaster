It should be 3,000,000.\n\n- The other two transactions for the same ID (`Initial20231231001` Bank deposit and Fixed Assets) have amounts (15,000,000 and 8,000,000) not conflicted with example, so only cash deposit value seems inconsistent.\n\n- Hence, internal inconsistency in `Initial20231231001` cash deposit amount field.\n\n- All other fields for that transaction seem consistent.\n\n- Therefore, the inconsistency identified is in recorded_amount of transaction ID `Initial20231231001` Cash deposit, with recorded=5,000,000 but correct=3,000,000 guided by the example.",
