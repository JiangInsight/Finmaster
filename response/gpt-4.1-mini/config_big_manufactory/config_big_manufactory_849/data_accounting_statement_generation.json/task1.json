Identify the initial cash on hand from the initial balances.\n2. Sum all cash inflows (receipts) during the period.\n3. Sum all cash outflows (payments) during the period.\n4. Calculate the final cash on hand = initial cash + inflows - outflows.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Cash on Hand\n\nFrom the initial balances provided, the entry with asset type \"Cash deposit\" or related to cash on hand is:\n\n- Cash deposit: 5,000,000.0\n\nThis is the initial cash on hand.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate inflows and outflows affecting cash on hand during the period\n\nUnder cash-related transactions, relevant fields are those with:\n\n- `payment_method` = \"Cash\" for expenses (outflows) and relevant sales (inflows).\n- The sales also indicate receive_method, either \"Cash\" or otherwise.\n- Purchases paid by Bank Transfer or Account Payable do not affect cash on hand.\n- Transfers labeled as \"Cash to bank transfer\" represent cash outflow (cash decreases).\n- We only consider transactions affecting cash on hand directly.\n\nLet's process the data:\n\n---\n\n### Cash Inflows\n\nFrom sales entries with receive_method = \"Cash\":\n\n- Sale20240106004: 748,087.14 (Paid, Cash receipt)\n- Sale20240108006: 2,146,535.22 (Paid, Cash receipt)\n- Sale20240119016: 1,348,068.18 (Paid, Cash receipt)\n- Sale20240124022: 677,364.56 (Paid, Cash receipt)\n- Sale20240125024: 2,210,585.18 (Paid, Cash receipt)\n- Other sales with Cash as receive_method, but unpaid or no payment_method specified, ignore.\n- Sale20240126025: 661,580.66 (Paid, Cash)\n- Sale20240130031: 1,492,870.6 (Paid, Cash)\n- In total, these are cash inflows from sales.\n\nSumming cash inflows from sales paid in cash:\n\nSum inflows = 748087.14 + 2146535.22 + 1348068.18 + 677364.56 + 2210585.18 + 661580.66 + 1492870.6\n\nLet's calculate this sum:\n\n- 748,087.14  \n+ 2,146,535.22 → 2,894,622.36  \n+ 1,348,068.18 → 4,242,690.54  \n+ 677,364.56 → 4,920,055.10  \n+ 2,210,585.18 → 7,130,640.28  \n+ 661,580.66 → 7,792,220.94  \n+ 1,492,870.6 → 9,285,091.54\n\n---\n\n### Cash Outflows\n\n1.
