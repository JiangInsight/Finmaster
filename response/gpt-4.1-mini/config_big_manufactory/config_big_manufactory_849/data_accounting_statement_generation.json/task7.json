From the transactions:\n\n- FixedAsset20231231001 entries (Fixed Assets Purchase):\n  - 886,161.25\n  - 839,853.83\n\n- Purchases that seem related to fixed assets (based on product_name being \"Heavy Equipment\" or similar):\n  - Purchase20231231001 (Heavy Equipment D) = 1,500,000.0\n  - Purchase20231231002 (Heavy Equipment A) = 500,000.0\n  - Purchase20231231003 (Heavy Equipment B) = 1,600,000.0\n  - Purchase20231231006 (Heavy Equipment C) = 2,000,000.0\n  - Purchase20231231007 (Heavy Equipment A) = 1,000,000.0\n  - Purchase20231231009 (Heavy Equipment A) = 1,000,000.0 (Did not appear but confirmed in the data as 1,000,000.0)\n  - Purchase20231231012 (Heavy Equipment D) = 1,500,000.0\n  - Purchase20231231013 (Heavy Equipment A) = 500,000.0\n  - Purchase20231231014 (Heavy Equipment C) = 1,000,000.0\n  - Purchase20231231010 (Heavy Equipment A) = 500,000.0\n  - Purchase20231231011 (Heavy Equipment A) = 500,000.0 (Unpaid, still asset addition)\n  \nAll these purchases are at 2023-12-31, so these should be included in fixed assets additions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate total additions of fixed assets purchases\n\nSum of all fixed assets purchase amounts after initial:\n\n- FixedAsset20231231001 purchases:\n  - 886,161.25 + 839,853.83 = 1,726,015.08\n\n- Purchases (Heavy Equipment and similar):\n  - 1,500,000.0 (P004)\n  - 500,000.0  (P001)\n  - 1,600,000.0 (P002)\n  - 2,000,000.0 (P003)\n  - 1,000,000.0 (P001)\n  - 1,000,000.0 (P001)\n  - 1,500,000.0 (P004)\n  - 500,000.0   (P001)\n  - 1,000,000.0 (P003)\n  - 500,000.0   (P001)\n  - 500,000.0   (P001) (Unpaid)\n\nSumming that:  \n1,500,000 + 500,000 + 1,600,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 = 11,100,000.0\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Depreciation reduction\n\n- Depreciation entries:\n  - 2024-01-01: 45,745.88  \n  - 2024-02-01: 60,147.44  \n\nTotal depreciation = 45,745.88 + 60,147.44 = 105,893.32\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Compute Fixed assets ending value\n\nEnding value = Initial value + Additions - Depreciation  \n= 8,000,000.00 + 11,100,000.00 - 105,893.32  \n= 19,000,000.00 - 105,893.32  \n= 18,894,106.68\n\n---\n\n### Final answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Fixed Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Fixed Assets End Value': '18894106.68'} }\n```",
