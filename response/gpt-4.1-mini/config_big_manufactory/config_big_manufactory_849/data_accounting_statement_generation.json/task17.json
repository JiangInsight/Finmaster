Usually, this comes from the equity section at the start, but since no retained earnings figure is explicitly given initially, we assume it starts at zero.\n\n2. Calculate net income (or loss) over the period. Net income is:\n\n   Net Income = Revenues - Expenses\n\n   In transaction data:\n   - Revenues are represented by sales amounts and interest income.\n   - Expenses include administrative expenses, sales expenses, financial expenses, depreciation, and any other recorded expenses.\n\n3. Retained earnings end value = Initial retained earnings + Net Income\n\n---\n\nStep 1: Initial retained earnings = 0.00 (not given explicitly, so we assume zero)\n\n---\n\nStep 2: Calculate net income.\n\nSum all revenues (sales and interest income):\n\n- Sales:\n\nOnly 'Sale' type rows contribute revenue.\n\nFrom the data, sum all 'Sale' amounts.\n\n- Interest:\n\nInclude \"Interest
