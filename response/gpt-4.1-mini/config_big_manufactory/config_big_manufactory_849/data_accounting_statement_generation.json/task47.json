Add all cash inflows (cash receipts + cash sales).\n3. Subtract all cash outflows (cash payments including purchases paid by cash, expenses paid by cash, fixed asset purchases paid by cash, but not bank transfer or unpaid amounts).\n4. Consider transfers between cash and bank accounts as they move cash within cash and cash equivalents.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\n- Initial Cash deposit: 5,000,000.0\n- Initial Bank deposit: 15,000,000.0\n\n**Initial Cash & Cash Equivalents = 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 = 20,000,000.0**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Cash Inflows\n\n- Sale payments with payment_method = Cash (or received in Cash)\n- Sales marked \"Paid\" with receive_method = Cash (or payment_method = Cash)\n- Other cash receipts if any\n\nFrom data:\n\n- Sale20240106004 (2024-01-06): Paid, cash sale = 748087.14 (Cash)\n- Sale20240108006 (2024-01-08): Paid, 2,146,535.22 (Cash)\n- Sale20240119016 (2024-01-19): Paid, 1,348,068.18 (Cash)\n- Sale20240122019 (2024-01-22): Paid, 694,657.72 (Cash)\n- Sale20240124022 (2024-01-24): Paid, 677,364.56 (Cash)\n- Sale20240125024 (2024-01-25): Paid, 2,210,585.18 (Cash)\n- Sale20240126025 (2024-01-26): Paid, 661,580.66 (Cash)\n- Sale20240130031 (2024-01-30): Paid, 1,492,870.6 (Cash)\n\nOther paid sales entries indicate \"Cash\" either in payment_method or receive_method.\n\n- Sale20240114010 and some others are unpaid or account receivable, so not cash inflows yet.\n\nSum of above cash sales:\n\n748,087.14 + 2,146,535.22 + 1,348,068.18 + 694,657.72 + 677,364.56 + 2,210,585.18 + 661,580.66 + 1,492,870.6\n= 9,879,749.26\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Cash Outflows\n\nOutflows include:\n\n- Purchases paid by Cash (payment_method = Cash and status Paid)\n- Expenses paid by Cash\n- Fixed assets paid by Cash or Bank transfer (Bank transfer reduces bank account, not cash)\n- Transfers from Cash to Bank (Cash out)\n- Other cash paid expenses\n\nFrom data:\n\n**Purchases paid by cash:**\n\n- Purchase20231231005: 1,000,000.0 Paid Cash\n- Purchase20231231006: 2,000,000 Paid Cash\n- Purchase20231231013: 500,000 Paid Bank Transfer (No)\n- No other purchases marked Paid Cash in sample\n\n(These entries except Purchase20231231005 and 06 are bank transfer or unpaid.)\n\nPurchases paid by Cash total: 1,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 3,000,000\n\n**Expenses paid by Cash:**\n\nSum all Expenses with payment_method = Cash and payment/receipt_status = Paid.\n\nFrom example:\n\n- 79714.42 (2024-01-01)\n- 51825.36 + 46725.01 (2024-01-02)\n- 74702.0 (2024-01-03)\n- 78889.09 (2024-01-04)\n- 38780.99 + 68900.09 (2024-01-05)\n- 87591.46 (2024-01-06)\n- 42856.74 (2024-01-07)\n- 52268.2 + 19689.35 (2024-01-08)\n- 93194.55 + 11813.06 (2024-01-09)\n- 86347.65 (2024-01-10)\n- 57634.9 (2024-01-11)\n- 20862.57 (2024-01-12)\n- 53549.48 + 20833.95 (2024-01-13)\n- 31910.69 (2024-01-14)\n- 46434.69 + 70515.58 (2024-01-15)\n- 73168.68 + 96515.15 (2024-01-16)\n- 69211.25 + 53607.84 (2024-01-17)\n- 14562.34 (2024-01-18)\n- 86673.6 (2024-01-19)\n- 87474.45 (2024-01-20)\n- 83217.37 (2024-01-21)\n- 28972.8 (2024-01-22)\n- 14855.75 (2024-01-23)\n- 39148.75 (2024-01-24)\n- 63370.0 (2024-01-29)\n- 45613.09 (2024-01-30)\n- 42688.86 (2024-01-31)\n- 58370.92 + 12261.8 (2024-02-01)\n- 31799.89 (2024-02-02)\n- 22552.8 (2024-02-03)\n- 83123.11 (2024-02-04)\n- 25065.28 + 90539.15 (2024-02-05)\n\nLet's sum these up:\n\nAdding them all:\n\n79714.42 + 51825.36 + 46725.01 + 74702.0 + 78889.09 + 38780.99 + 68900.09 + 87591.46 + 42856.74 + 52268.2 + 19689.35 + 93194.55 + 11813.06 + 86347.65 + 57634.9 + 20862.57 + 53549.48 + 20833.95 + 31910.69 + 46434.69 + 70515.58 + 73168.68 + 96515.15 + 69211.25 + 53607.84 + 14562.34 + 86673.6 + 87474.45 + 83217.37 + 28972.8 + 14855.75 + 39148.75 + 63370.0 + 45613.09 + 42688.86 + 58370.92 + 12261.8 + 31799.89 + 22552.8 + 83123.11 + 25065.28 + 90539.15\n\n= Let's compute stepwise:\n\n79714.42  \n+ 51825.36 = 131539.78  \n+ 46725.01 = 178264.79  \n+ 74702.0  = 252966.79  \n+ 78889.09 = 331855.88  \n+ 38780.99 = 370636.87  \n+ 68900.09 = 439536.96  \n+ 87591.46 = 527128.42  \n+ 42856.74 = 569985.16  \n+ 52268.2  = 622253.36  \n+ 19689.35 = 641942.71  \n+ 93194.55 = 735137.26  \n+ 11813.06 = 746950.32  \n+ 86347.65 = 833297.97  \n+ 57634.9  = 890932.87  \n+ 20862.57 = 911795.44  \n+ 53549.48 = 965344.92  \n+ 20833.95 = 986178.87  \n+ 31910.69 = 1018089.56  \n+ 46434.69 = 1064524.25  \n+ 70515.58 = 1135039.83  \n+ 73168.68 = 1208208.51  \n+ 96515.15 = 1304723.66  \n+ 69211.25 = 1373934.91  \n+ 53607.84 = 1427542.75  \n+ 14562.34 = 1442105.09  \n+ 86673.6  = 1528778.69  \n+ 87474.45 = 1616253.14  \n+ 83217.37 = 1699470.51  \n+ 28972.8  = 1728443.31  \n+ 14855.75 = 1743299.06  \n+ 39148.75 = 1782447.81  \n+ 63370.0  = 1845817.81  \n+ 45613.09 = 1891430.9  \n+ 42688.86 = 1934119.76  \n+ 58370.92 = 1992480.68  \n+ 12261.8  = 2004742.48  \n+ 31799.89 = 2036542.37  \n+ 22552.8  = 2059095.17  \n+ 83123.11 = 2142218.28  \n+ 25065.28 = 2167283.56  \n+ 90539.15 = 2257822.71  \n\n**Total cash expenses = 2,257,822.71**\n\n**Fixed asset purchases paid by cash:**\n\n- None indicated as 'Cash'.
