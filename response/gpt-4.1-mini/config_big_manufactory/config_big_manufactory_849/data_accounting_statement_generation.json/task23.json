The cost of goods sold reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all the sales entries with their respective cost amounts.**  \nFrom the problem data, relevant sales entries with cost_amount field are:\n\n- Sale on 2024-01-06: cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n- Sale on 2024-01-08: cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n- Sale on 2024-01-11: cost_amount = 800,000.0  \n- Sale on 2024-01-14: cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n- Sale on 2024-01-19: cost_amount = 1,000,000.0  \n- Sale on 2024-01-24: cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n- Sale on 2024-01-25: cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n- Sale on 2024-01-26: cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n- Sale on 2024-01-30: cost_amount = 1,000,000.0  \n- Sale on 2024-01-31: cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n- Sale on 2024-02-02: cost_amount = 500,000.0  \n- Sale on 2024-02-04: cost_amount = 1,500,000.0  \n\n**Step 2: Sum all the cost_amount values listed above.**\n\nSummation:\n\n500,000 + 1,500,000 + 800,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 1,500,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 + 1,500,000  \n= (500 + 1500 + 800 + 500 + 1000 + 500 + 1500 + 500 + 1000 + 500 + 500 + 1500) thousand  \n= 11,300,000\n\n**Step 3: Final COGS**\n\nThe final cost of goods sold is 11,300,000.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"11300000.00\"}}\n```\n\n# Final answer:\n{\"solution\": {\"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"11300000.00\"}}",
