                        "content": "To calculate the net cash flow from investing activities, we typically consider the cash flows related to the purchase and sale of long-term assets. From the provided data:\n\n**Identify cash flows related to investing activities:**\n\n1. **Fixed Assets Purchase:** These are cash outflows (investing outflows).\n   - FixedAsset20231231001: 886,161.25 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n   - FixedAsset20231231001: 839,853.83 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n   - No other fixed asset purchases are mentioned here.\n\n2. **Purchases of long-term assets:** Purchases related to heavy equipment or fixed assets likely investing outflows.\n   Look for Purchase entries related to equipment or assets with payment method involving cash or bank transfer (paid only).\n\nFrom the given purchases:\n- 1,500,000 (Heavy Equipment D) - Paid, Bank Transfer\n- 500,000 (Heavy Equipment A) - Paid, Bank Transfer\n- 1,600,000 (Heavy Equipment B, 2 units) - Paid, Bank Transfer\n- 1,000,000 (Heavy Equipment C) - Paid, Cash\n- 2,000,000 (Heavy Equipment C, 2 units) - Paid, Cash\n- 1,000,000 (Heavy Equipment A) - Paid, Bank Transfer\n- 1,500,000 (Heavy Equipment D) - Paid, Bank Transfer\n- 1,000,000 (Heavy Equipment A) - Paid, Bank Transfer\n- 500,000 (Heavy Equipment A) - Paid, Bank Transfer\n- 1,000,000 (Heavy Equipment C) - Paid, Bank Transfer\n- 500,000 (Heavy Equipment A) - Paid, Bank Transfer\n- 1,500,000 (Heavy Equipment D) - Paid, Bank Transfer\n\nNotice some purchases marked as unpaid or account payable are not cash outflows.\n\nSum only those paid and considered investing purchase expenditures, exclude administrative, sales, financial expenses.\n\n3. **Sales of Long-term Assets:** These generate cash inflows from investing activities. Given there are no explicit asset sales in the data but only sales of products (with payment_method blanks or cash). These are operating activities, not investing.\n\n**So, net cash flow from investing activities = Cash inflow from asset disposals (if any) - Cash outflow for asset purchases**\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Sum of Fixed Assets Purchase (Cash Outflow)**\n\n- 886,161.25 (FixedAsset Purchase - Bank Transfer)\n- 839,853.83 (FixedAsset Purchase - Bank Transfer)\n\nSum = 886,161.25 + 839,853.83 = 1,726,015.08\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Sum of Paid Purchases of Heavy Equipment (Investing Assets)**\n\nFrom \"Purchase\" entries with payment status 'Paid' and payment_method cash or bank transfer, for equipment assets:\n\n- 1,500,000.0 (Heavy Equipment D) Paid Bank Transfer\n- 500,000.0 (Heavy Equipment A) Paid Bank Transfer\n- 1,600,000.0 (Heavy Equipment B, 2 units) Paid Bank Transfer (quantity 2 × 800,000 unit price)\n- 1,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment C) Paid Cash\n- 2,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment C, 2 units) Paid Cash\n- 1,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment A) Paid Bank Transfer (2 units × 500,000 each)\n- 1,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment C) Paid Bank Transfer\n- 500,000.0 (Heavy Equipment A) Paid Bank Transfer\n- 1,500,000.0 (Heavy Equipment D) Paid Bank Transfer\n- 500,000.0 (Heavy Equipment A) Paid Bank Transfer\n\nAdd these:\n\nSum = 1,500,000 + 500,000 + 1,600,000 + 1,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 +1,500,000 + 500,000\n\nCalculate stepwise:\n\n- 1,500,000 + 500,000 = 2,000,000\n- +1,600,000 = 3,600,000\n- +1,000,000 = 4,600,000\n- +2,000,000 = 6,600,000\n- +1,000,000 = 7,600,000\n- +1,000,000 = 8,600,000\n- +500,000 = 9,100,000\n- +1,500,000 = 10,600,000\n- +500,000 = 11,100,000\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Sales of Long-term Assets?**\n\n- No explicit fixed asset sales or disposal entries found. So no inflows for investing activities.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Compute Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**\n\nNet Cash Flow (Investing) = Cash Inflows from Asset Sales - Cash Outflows for Asset Purchases\n\n= 0 - (Fixed Asset Purchase + Equipment Purchase)\n\n= 0 - (1,726,015.08 + 11,100,000)\n\n= -12,826,015.08\n\n---\n\n**Final result:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-12826015.08\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n# Summary:\n\nAll purchases marked as paid and related to fixed or heavy equipment are investing outflows.\n\nNo asset sales recorded, so no inflow.\n\nHence net cash outflow = total paid purchases on fixed assets + heavy equipment purchases.\n\n# Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-12826015.08\"}}\n```",
