Identify the accounts receivable balances at the beginning and end of the period.\n2. Calculate the net change in accounts receivable.\n\n**Step 1: Identify beginning accounts receivable balance (as of 2023-12-31).**\n\nAccording to the data, the initial balances for accounts receivable are not directly given. We infer initial accounts receivable from the \"Sale\" transactions that are unpaid or on account receivable on 2023-12-31 or before.\n\nSince all sales are dated 2024 or later, we consider starting accounts receivable balance as zero or not given. We will only consider the accumulated accounts receivable generated during 2024.\n\n**Step 2: Sum the accounts receivable increases during the period (based on sales on account).**\n\nFor each \"Sale\" with payment/receipt_status \"Unpaid\" and receive_method \"Account Receviable\":\n\nSum the after_tax_amount or amount? Since 'amount' includes tax, but 'after_tax_amount' excludes tax but adds tax (with tax amount column), either would do. Usually accounts receivable is gross amount due from customers, including tax.\n\nIn records:\n\n- Sales that are Unpaid AND receive_method includes \"Account Receviable\" (some are misspelled but consistent):\n\nNote: The column is \"payment/receipt_status\", and the relevant sales have \"Unpaid\".\n\n**Extract and sum unpaid sales on account:**\n\nList of unpaid sales and amounts (amount column):\n\n- 2024-01-03: 33111.75 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 2024-01-04: 289119.85 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 2024-01-10: 124688.16 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 2024-01-11: 1151336.63 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 2024-01-14: 24676.98 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 2024-01-14: 317862.15 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 2024-01-22: 69482.82 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 2024-01-23: 1076054.24 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 2024-01-24: 121475.35 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 2024-01-24: 51480.08 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 2024-01-25: 124952.5 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 2024-01-25: 24341.12 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 2024-01-28: 113413.1 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 2024-01-31: 717864.25 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 2024-02-02: 660969.7 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 2024-02-04: 2109215.99 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\nAlso 2024-01-19 sale 590628.7 is Unpaid and Account Receviable.\n\nChecking for spelling \"Account Receviable\" or \"Account Receivable\" consistently is shown as \"Account Receviable\" (typo) in dataset.\n\nIncluding all such sales:\n\nSumming these amounts:\n\nSum unpaid sales on account receivable:\n\n33111.75  \n+289119.85  \n+124688.16  \n+1151336.63  \n+24676.98  \n+317862.15  \n+69482.82  \n+1076054.24  \n+121475.35  \n+51480.08  \n+124952.5  \n+24341.12  \n+113413.1  \n+717864.25  \n+660969.7  \n+2109215.99  \n+590628.7\n\nCalculate the sum:\n\n33111.75 + 289119.85 = 322231.6  \n322231.6 + 124688.16 = 446919.76  \n446919.76 + 1151336.63 = 1598256.39  \n1598256.39 + 24676.98 = 1622933.37  \n1622933.37 + 317862.15 = 1940795.52  \n1940795.52 + 69482.82 = 2010278.34  \n2010278.34 + 1076054.24 = 3086332.58  \n3086332.58 + 121475.35 = 3207807.93  \n3207807.93 + 51480.08 = 3259288.01  \n3259288.01 + 124952.5 = 3384240.51  \n3384240.51 + 24341.12 = 3408581.63  \n3408581.63 + 113413.1 = 3521994.73  \n3521994.73 + 717864.25 = 4239858.98  \n4239858.98 + 660969.7 = 4900828.68  \n4900828.68 + 2109215.99 = 7010044.67  \n7010044.67 + 590628.7 = 7600673.37\n\n**Total accounts receivable generated during period = approx 7,600,673.37**\n\n**Step 3: Sum accounts receivable collections (paid sales on account).**\n\nSales with payment/receipt_status \"Paid\" and receive_method empty or \"Cash\" do not count as accounts receivable collected (they were paid immediately).\n\nHowever, some sales have payment/receipt_status \"Paid\" but still have a customer_id and may or may not be on account receivable.\n\nWe should exclude fully cash sales.\n\nLet's confirm if any paid sales are on account receivable.\n\nFrom the data, paid sales generally have receive_method \"Cash\", so these do not affect accounts receivable changes.\n\nTherefore, assume all accounts receivable collected amount comes from sales that were previously recorded as accounts receivable and now paid.\n\nBut the dataset does not explicitly say which receivables were collected.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate initial accounts receivable balance at period start.**\n\nNo data provided, assume zero.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate ending accounts receivable balance.**\n\nThe ending accounts receivable balance equals the sum of the unpaid sales amounts on account receivable.\n\nFollowing the list above, totaling approx 7,600,673.37, this is the ending accounts receivable balance.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the net change in accounts receivable.**\n\nAssuming starting balance: 0  \nEnding balance: 7,600,673.37\n\nIncrease in accounts receivable = Ending - Starting = +7,600,673.37\n\n**Step 7: Present result for cash flow statement.**\n\nIncrease in accounts receivable represents a use of cash, therefore in cash flow statement it is reported as negative.\n\nHence:\n\n`(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable = -7,600,673.37`\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-7600673.37\"}}\n```}",
