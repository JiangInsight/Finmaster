                        "content": "To calculate the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities, we need to:\n\n1. Sum cash inflows from operating activities (mainly cash received from sales).\n2. Subtract cash outflows related to operating activities (mainly payments for purchases, expenses, financial expenses).\n3. Adjust for non-cash items such as depreciation.\n4. Do not include investing and financing cash flows (e.g., fixed assets purchase, bank deposit/transfer).\n5. Interest receivables are typically investing activities or financing, not operating cash flows, so exclude them.\n6. Only consider payments with \"Paid\" status for cash flows (unpaid means no cash outflow yet).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify sales (cash inflows)\n\n- Sales with \"Paid\" status, and payment_method in cash (to count as cash received).\n\nLooking at sales entries (type = Sale), we identify all with payment/receipt_status = Paid and payment_method = Cash (or unspecified cash).\n\nFrom the data, e.g.,\n\n- Sale20240106004: amount 748,087.14, Paid, Cash  \n- Sale20240108006: 2,146,535.22, Paid, Cash  \n- Sale20240130031: 1,492,870.6, Paid, Cash  \n\nand so forth.\n\nWe sum all sales with \"Paid\" status (payment_method here is left blank or cash). From data, payment_method is often blank under sale, but sometimes shows specifics. Since unclear, assume all Paid sales are cash inflows from operating (since sales payment_method is mostly blank). But when \"Cash\" is explicitly stated we include them, for safety.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify cash payments for:\n\n- Purchases with payment_status == Paid (reduce cash flow).\n- Expenses (Sales, Administrative, Financial) with payment_status == Paid.\n- Interest Receivables are Unpaid and considered non-cash operating flow. Ignore cash effect.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Depreciation is non-cash expense, add back to net income or subtract as it reduces profit but not cash:\n- We subtract depreciation when calculating cash flow indirect method, to add back non-cash expenses that reduce profit but not cash.\n- So depreciation amount will be added back.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Exclude investing and financing cash flow items:\n\n- Initial balances (cash deposit, bank deposit) are not operating.\n- Fixed Assets purchase is investing.\n- Transfers between cash and bank are financing or managing cash.\n- Interest Receivables are non-cash or investing financing.\n\n---\n\n### Calculation - Detailed\n\n**Sum of cash inflows (Sales with Paid status):**\n\nSum all Sale records with \"Paid\" status:\n\nFrom data (excerpt for sales Paid):\n\n| ID           | Amount       | payment/receipt_status | payment_method |\n|--------------|--------------|-----------------------|----------------|\n| Sale20240106004 |
