(Original profit is 160,969.7)\n  \n- **Reasoning**:\n  - Invoice and other fields indicate a sale of one unit at 660,969.7 with tax 33,048.49, cost 500,000 and thus profit about 160,969.7.\n  - The recorded quantity of zero and paid status contradict the invoice and other details.\n  - Correct values are taken from invoice-related data and consistent fields.\n\n- **Corrections**:\n  - **recorded_quantity**: should be 1.0\n  - **recorded_payment/receipt_status**: should be \"Unpaid\"\n  - **recorded_amount**: should be 660,969.7\n  - **recorded_profit**: should be about 160,969.7 (from total amount - cost - tax)\n\nAll other fields appear consistent with invoice data and no other internal inconsistencies were detected.",
