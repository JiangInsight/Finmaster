But since invoice and amount is the most trusted, and they align, no errors found.\n\n- No errors on reviewed transactions; no other fields seem inconsistent based on the data and problem instructions.\n\nHence, no errors were found that required adjustment; the response clarifies the given information is consistent.\n\nIf there is expected to list only inconsistencies/errors, then none found in this dataset based on provided fields and reliable invoice information.",
