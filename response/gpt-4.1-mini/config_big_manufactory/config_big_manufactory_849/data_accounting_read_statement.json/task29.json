So, the total income is 16,388,736.33.\n\nStep 2: Identify the sub-items that make up this total income.  \nFrom the income statement, the only listed component income item under total revenue is \"Main Business Revenue\" with the same value of 16,388,736.33.\n\nStep 3: For the sub-items, output their initial and final values.  \nSince only one sub-item is listed (Main Business Revenue), and values do not change (no initial and final date/value pairs provided), we consider the single value as both initial and final.\n\nStep 4: Format the solution as requested.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"16388736.33\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"16388736.33\"}}\n```",
