The negative sign indicates an increase in accounts receivable (since the line includes Increase/Decrease and negative usually means increase in asset).\n\nHowever, the prompt says \"decrease in amounts owed to the entity.\" We need to extract the value of the decrease. Here, the value is negative, meaning accounts receivable increased (amount owed to entity increased), so there is no decrease.\n\nBut the task is to \"Based on the cash flow statement, identify and extract the specific line items and value of decrease in amounts owed to the entity...\"\n\nSo, the \"Decrease in amounts owed to the entity\" would be the related line \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable,\" but in this case, the value is negative, meaning it's actually an increase, not a decrease.\n\nShould we still return the value? The example input returned the value as is regardless of sign.\n\nGiven the example, the solution returned the value as-is, negative, for \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\". So we do the same here.\n\nTherefore,\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-6408987.07'} }\n```\n\nThis is consistent with the example.",
