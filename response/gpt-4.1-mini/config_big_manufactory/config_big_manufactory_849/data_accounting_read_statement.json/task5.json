Assets held for sale, in production for sale, or being manufactured typically appear under **Inventory** on the balance sheet.\n\n2. From the provided table, the line item \"Inventory\" has the following values:\n   - Initial amount: 0.00 (2023-12-31)\n   - End amount: 5600000.00 (2024-02-05)\n\n3. No other line items explicitly indicate assets held for sale or in production/manufacturing.\n\nTherefore, the values for assets held for sale or in production are reflected in the \"Inventory\" amounts.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"5600000.00\"}}\n```",
