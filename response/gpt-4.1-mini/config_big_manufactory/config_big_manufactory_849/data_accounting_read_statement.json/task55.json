From the income statement, the line item indicating the total tax expense payable by the entity is:\n   - \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of 819436.82.\n\n2. From the balance sheet, the related liability that shows the tax amount expected to be paid or recovered is:\n   - \"Taxes Payable\" with an end amount of 819436.82.\n\nBoth numbers are consistent, implying the total tax to be paid by the entity during the reporting period is 819436.82.\n\nHence, the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay in this period is 819436.82.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '819436.82'} }\n```",
