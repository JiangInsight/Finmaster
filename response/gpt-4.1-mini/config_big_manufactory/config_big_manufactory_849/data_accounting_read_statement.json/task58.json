Cash and cash equivalents usually include \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" on the balance sheet.\n3. From the provided balance sheet, the \"Initial_amount\" values at the \"Initial_date\" 2023-12-31 are:\n   - Cash on Hand: 5,000,000.00\n   - Bank Deposits: 15,000,000.00\n4. Usually, cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period would sum these amounts.\n5. Adding these amounts: 5,000,000.00 + 15,000,000.00 = 20,000,000.00\n6. This aligns with the \"Beginning Balance\" under cash flow for cash and cash equivalents: 20,000,000.00 on 2024-02-05, confirming the total cash and cash equivalents at the start.\n\nTherefore, the value for cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period is \"20000000.00\"\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"20000000.00\"}}\n```",
