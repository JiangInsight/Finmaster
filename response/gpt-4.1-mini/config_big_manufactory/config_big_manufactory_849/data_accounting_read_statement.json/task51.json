The task is to identify and extract the line item related to interest accrued but not yet received, including its initial and final value.\n\n2. From the balance sheet, the relevant line item is \"Interest Receivable\":\n   - Initial amount: 0.00 (2023-12-31)\n   - End amount: 23583.67 (2024-02-05)\n\n3. This is confirmed by the cash flow statement showing a change in Interest Receivable of -23583.67, and the income statement lists Interest Income also as 23583.67, which aligns with the accrued interest.\n\nTherefore, the initial value is 0.00 and the end value is 23583.67.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"23583.67\"} }\n```",
