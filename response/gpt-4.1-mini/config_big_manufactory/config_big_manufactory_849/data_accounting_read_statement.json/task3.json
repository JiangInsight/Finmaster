This typically corresponds to \"Accounts Receivable\" in a balance sheet.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n- Look for line items representing amounts owed to the entity (usually Accounts Receivable).\n- Identify the initial amount (Initial_amount) and initial date (Initial_date).\n- Identify the end amount (End_amount) and end date (End_date).\n- From the given problem, the line item \"Accounts Receivable\" shows:\n  - Initial_amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n  - End_amount: 6408987.07 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\nThus, the amounts owed to the entity on credit are represented by Accounts Receivable.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"6408987.07\"}}\n```",
