                        "content": "To solve the task, let's identify the three specific line items from the financial statements as requested:\n\n1. Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense → This corresponds to the \"Profit Before Tax\" from the Income Statement.\n\n2. Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period → This corresponds to the increase in \"Accounts Payable\" from the Balance Sheet (the amount owed to suppliers, etc.).\n\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares → This corresponds to \"Paid-in Capital\" from the Balance Sheet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Balance Sheet\n\n- Paid-in Capital (Capital contributed by shareholders):  \n  End_amount = 28000000.00\n\n- Accounts Payable (Addition in amount owed):  \n  End_amount = 3500000.00\n\n### Step 2: Income Statement\n\n- Profit Before Tax:  \n  Amount = 2110271.98\n\n---\n\nSummarizing in order:\n\n- Balance Sheet:  \n  1. Paid-in Capital = 28000000.00  \n  2. Accounts Payable = 3500000.00\n\n- Income Statement:  \n  3. Profit Before Tax = 2110271.98\n\nNo values are requested from Cash Flow Statement per se, so we skip that here.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"3500000.00\", \"value2\": \"2110271.98\", \"value3\": \"28000000.00\"}}\n```\n\nNote:  \nAccording to the task's instruction:  \n- Group by financial statement order: 1. Balance Sheet 2. Income Statement 3. Cash Flow Statement  \n- Maintain original line item order as shown in input.  \n\nThe three line items are:\n\n- From Balance Sheet: Accounts Payable (addition) → value1  \n- From Income Statement: Profit Before Tax → value2  \n- From Balance Sheet: Paid-in Capital → value3  \n\nHowever, instructions specify grouping by financial statement: Balance Sheet first (so probably list all balance sheet items first, then income), and within balance sheet maintain line order.\n\nLine order in balance sheet is (Accounts Payable first, then Paid-in Capital later). So order is:\n\n- value1: Accounts Payable = 3500000.00  \n- value2: Profit Before Tax = 2110271.98  \n- value3: Paid-in Capital = 28000000.00\n\nThis matches the example output's pattern (where Paid-in Capital is first balance sheet item, then profit before tax, then accounts payable), but given the problem statement that says \"For multiple outputs, group them by financial statement in the following order: 1.Balance Sheet 2.Income Statement 3.Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement.\"\n\nGiven the three items come from balance sheet (two of them) and income statement:\n\n- Balance Sheet items: Accounts Payable (line 11), Paid-in Capital (line 14)  \n- Income Statement items: Profit Before Tax (line 12 in income statement)\n\nHence,\n\nOutput order:  \nFrom Balance Sheet in input order: Accounts Payable (3500000.00), Paid-in Capital (28000000.00)  \nFrom Income Statement: Profit Before Tax (2110271.98)  \n\nSince the task wants three values only, the problem example solution only used three values corresponding to:\n\n- Balance Sheet → value1 (Paid-in Capital)  \n- Income Statement → value2 (Profit Before Tax)  \n- Balance Sheet → value3 (Accounts Payable)\n\nSo apparently the expected order is:\n\n- value1: Paid-in Capital (capital contributed by shareholders)\n\n- value2: Profit Before Tax\n\n- value3: Accounts Payable (addition in amount owed)\n\nSince the instruction is grouping by financial statement order first (balance sheet first), within balance sheet maintain original line order, but in example the three outputs are Paid-in Capital first, then Profit Before Tax, then Accounts Payable last.\n\nHence to follow example, final answer is:\n\n- value1: Paid-in Capital = 28000000.00 (from balance sheet)\n\n- value2: Profit Before Tax = 2110271.98 (income statement)\n\n- value3: Accounts Payable = 3500000.00 (balance sheet)\n\n---\n\n### Final answer in required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"28000000.00\", \"value2\": \"2110271.98\", \"value3\": \"3500000.00\"}}\n```",
