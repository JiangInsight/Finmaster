These typically correspond to the **non-current assets** shown on the balance sheet.\n\nFrom the problem data:\n\n- Fixed Assets: Initial_amount = 8,000,000.00; End_amount = 9,726,015.08\n- Accumulated Depreciation: Initial_amount = 0.00; End_amount = 105,893.32 (this reduces the value of fixed assets)\n- Total Non-current Assets: Initial_amount = 8,000,000.00; End_amount = 9,620,121.76\n\nSince \"Total Non-current Assets\" is the line item that represents assets not intended for sale or consumption in normal operation (such as fixed assets), it already properly reflects the net value after accumulated depreciation.\n\nHence, the initial value and end value to report are those of Total Non-current Assets:\n\n- Initial value = 8,000,000.00\n- End value = 9,620,121.76\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"9620121.76\"} }\n```",
