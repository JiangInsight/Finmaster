                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the following three specific values:\n\n1. The amounts of taxes accrued but not yet paid → from the Balance Sheet: line item \"Taxes Payable\"  \n2. Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities → from the Income Statement: typically \"Main Business Revenue\"  \n3. Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the principal revenue-producing activities of the entity and other activities that are not investing or financing activities → from the Cash Flow Statement: \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\"  \n\nLet's locate these values step-by-step:\n\n### 1. Taxes accrued but not yet paid (Balance Sheet)\n\nFrom Balance Sheet table, find \"Taxes Payable\" end amount:\n\n| Account       | End_amount |  \n|---------------|------------|  \n| Taxes Payable | 819436.82  |  \n\nSo, value1 = '819436.82'\n\n---\n\n### 2. Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities (Income Statement)\n\nFrom Income Statement, the main revenue line is \"Main Business Revenue\":\n\n| Account              | Amount      |  \n|----------------------|-------------|  \n| Main Business Revenue | 16388736.33 |  \n\nSo, value2 = '16388736.33'\n\n---\n\n### 3. Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities (Cash Flow Statement)\n\nFrom Cash Flow Statement, find \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\":\n\n| Account                           | Amount       |  \n|----------------------------------|--------------|  \n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities | -6316405.44 |  \n\nSo, value3 = '-6316405.44'\n\n---\n\n### Final solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"819436.82\", \"value2\": \"16388736.33\", \"value3\": \"-6316405.44\"}}\n```",
