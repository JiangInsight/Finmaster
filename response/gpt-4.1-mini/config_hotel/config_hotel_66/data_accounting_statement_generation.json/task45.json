                        "content": "To calculate the final net cash flows from investing activities, we need to:\n\n1. Identify transactions related to investing activities. Typical investing activities include:\n   - Purchase of fixed assets (cash outflow)\n   - Sale or disposal of fixed assets (cash inflow)\n   - Purchase or sale of investments (if any)\n   \n2. From the problem data, look for entries related to fixed assets or any capital asset investing.\n\nLooking at the problem data:\n\n- The initial fixed assets amount is 8,000,000, but this is an initial balance, not a cash flow.\n- Purchase transactions related to Fixed Assets or capital assets should be considered. Here:\n\n| id                | type                 | date       | amount    | payment_method  | other details    |\n|-------------------|----------------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets          | 2023-12-31 | 8000000.0 |                 | initial balance  |\n\nNo explicit sales or disposals of fixed assets are shown in this dataset.\n\n- Purchases are mostly of products, food sets, rooms, banquet sets, etc., related to operations, so not investing activities.\n\n- No lines that indicate fixed asset purchases or sales explicitly except the initial fixed asset balance.\n\nIn the example, the relevant investing cash flow was:\n\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 305354.43 | Paid | Bank Transfer | S010 | Supplier 10 | Storage Facilities\n\nThat inflow/outflow was used as investing cash flow (-305354.43).\n\nIn the current problem data, we do NOT have any similar \"FixedAsset\" or \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" type transactions or explicit investment purchases/sales.\n\nTherefore, for the problem data:\n\n- No purchase of fixed assets (except initial balance which is not cash flow for current period)\n\n- No sale or disposal of fixed assets\n\nHence, the net cash flow from investing activities = 0.\n\n# Final answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0\"} }\n````",
