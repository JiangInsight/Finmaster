Here we can see purchases of products with product IDs starting with \"F\" or \"R\" (likely furniture and real estate) and large amounts. However, safer is to pick Purchase transactions and correlate.\n\nGiven that purchases of assets have the following product IDs related to fixed assets:  \n- F004 (Banquet Set)  \n- R003 (Luxury Suite)  \n- R002 (Business Room)  \n- R001 (Standard Room)  \n- F003 (Deluxe Meal Set)  \n- F002 (Business Meal Set)  \n- F001 (Quick Meal Set)  \n\nEach purchase amount is present, so all these purchases add value to fixed assets.\n\nSum all \"Purchase\" amounts:\n\nPurchases amounts:  \n- 371,520.0  \n- 829,440.0  \n- 35,000.0  \n- 1,250,000.0  \n- 246,000.0  \n- 582,000.0  \n- 140,800.0  \n- 254,320.0  \n- 240,240.0  \n- 177,000.0  \n- 59850.0  \n- 820,800.0  \n- 80,500.0  \n- 328,000.0  \n- 140,800.0 < repeated?
