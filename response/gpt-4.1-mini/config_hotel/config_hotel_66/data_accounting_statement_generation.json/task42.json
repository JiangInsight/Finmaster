                        "content": "To calculate the final tax payable item (Increase or Decrease in Tax Payable) in the cash flow statement, we analyze the tax amounts related to sales and purchases. Tax payable typically increases due to taxes related to sales (output VAT) and decreases due to taxes related to purchases (input VAT). Hence:\n\n**Step 1: Sum of Tax Amounts from Sales (Output Tax)**  \n- Sum all the `tax_amount` from records of type **Sale**.\n\n**Step 2: Sum of Tax Amounts from Purchases (Input Tax)**  \n- Sum all the `tax_amount` from records of type **Purchase**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable**  \n- Tax Payable = Total Sales Tax - Total Purchase Tax\n\n---\n\n### Extract and Calculate (rounded two decimals):\n\nFrom the problem data (filtered to relevant transaction types):\n\n- **Sales Tax Amounts (tax_amount) from Sale records:**  \n  940.95 + 866.46 + 983.22 + 639.49 + 92.81 + 336.75 + 128.3 + 1441.8 + 758.26 + 830.64 + 704.22 + 539.17 + 399.83 + 195.75 + 514.92 + 1025.05 + 618.01 + 217.16 + 1020.16 + 848.41 + 543.69 + 701.6 + 500.05 + 199.58 + 144.93 + 195.75 + 514.92 + 1025.05 + 838.89 + 199.58 + 758.26 + 830.64 + 701.6 + 358.75 + ...
