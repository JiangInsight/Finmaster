Identify if there is any initial \"Accounts Payable\" balance on the initial date (2023-12-31).\n2. Sum all purchase amounts (transaction type Purchase) that are marked **Unpaid**. These represent payables incurred during the period.\n3. Subtract any purchases that are **Paid** (these do not increase Accounts Payable).\n4. There is no explicit previous initial Accounts Payable given in the initial balances. So initial Accounts Payable = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Accounts Payable\n\nThere is no explicit \"Accounts Payable\" initial entry listed on 2023-12-31 in the initial balances.\n\n- Initial Accounts Payable = 0.00\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate total unpaid purchases (Accounts Payable increase)\n\nFrom the transactions, sum purchase amounts where:\n\n- `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\"\n- `payment_method` is \"Account Payable\"\n\nLet's identify all such purchases and sum amounts.\n\nListed purchases with 'Unpaid' and payment_method 'Account Payable':\n\n| id              | amount    | payment_status | payment_method   |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------------|------------------|\n| Purchase20231231002 | 829,440.0   | Unpaid         | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231004 | 1,250,000.0 | Unpaid         | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231005 | 246,000.0   | Unpaid         | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231007 | 140,800.0   | Unpaid         | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231009 | 58,500.0    | Unpaid         | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231014 | 755,000.0   | Unpaid         | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231018 | 585,000.0   | Unpaid         | Account Payable  |\n\nNote: Purchase IDs shown above with these conditions, from dataset (some entries from the example problem above included).\n\nChecking from the problem data:\n\n- Purchase20231231002: 829,440.0, Unpaid, Account Payable\n- Purchase20231231004: 1,250,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable\n- Purchase20231231005: 246,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable\n- Purchase20231231007: 140,800.0, Unpaid, Account Payable\n- Purchase20231231009: 58,500.0, Unpaid, Account Payable\n- Purchase20231231014: 755,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable\n- Purchase20231231018: 585,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable\n- Purchase20231231023: 358,500.0, Unpaid, Account Payable (found later in data)\n- Purchase20231231019: 32,850.0, Unpaid, Account Payable\n- Purchase20231231020: 36,050.0, Paid, Bank Transfer (exclude)\n- Purchase20231231021: 35,850.0, Paid, Cash (exclude)\n- Purchase20231231022: 19,050.0, Unpaid, Account Payable\n- Purchase20231231013: 585,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable\n- Purchase20231231011: 540,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable\n- Purchase20231231016: 820,800.0, Paid, Bank Transfer (exclude)\n- Purchase20231231015: 59,850.0, Unpaid, Account Payable\n- Purchase20231231024: 402,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable\n\nLet's sum all unpaid purchases with Account Payable method:\n\nSum amounts (only Unpaid + Account Payable):\n\n- 829,440.00 (P20231231002)\n- 1,250,000.00 (P20231231004)\n- 246,000.00 (P20231231005)\n- 140,800.00 (P20231231007)\n- 58,500.00 (P20231231009)\n- 755,000.00 (P20231231014)\n- 585,000.00 (P20231231013)\n- 585,000.00 (P20231231018)\n- 358,500.00 (P20231231023)\n- 32,850.00 (P20231231019)\n- 19,050.00 (P20231231022)\n- 540,000.00 (P20231231011)\n- 59,850.00 (P20231231015)\n- 402,000.00 (P20231231024)\n\nLet's compute accurately:\n\n829,440.00  \n+ 1,250,000.00 = 2,079,440.00  \n+ 246,000.00 = 2,325,440.00  \n+ 140,800.00 = 2,466,240.00  \n+ 58,500.00 = 2,524,740.00  \n+ 755,000.00 = 3,279,740.00  \n+ 585,000.00 = 3,864,740.00  \n+ 585,000.00 = 4,449,740.00  \n+ 358,500.00 = 4,808,240.00  \n+ 32,850.00 = 4,841,090.00  \n+ 19,050.00 = 4,860,140.00  \n+ 540,000.00 = 5,400,140.00  \n+ 59,850.00 = 5,459,990.00  \n+ 402,000.00 = 5,861,990.00\n\nTotal unpaid purchases (AP) = 5,861,990.00\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Subtract paid purchases that reduce AP\n\nPaid purchases are not added to accounts payable.
