In the provided data, the initial amounts are:\n   - Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0 (asset)  \n   - Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0 (asset)  \n   - Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.0 (asset)  \n   None of these initial values are liabilities.\n\n   So, **Total Liabilities Initial Value = 0.00**\n\n2. **Identify liabilities from transactions**:\n   We focus on purchases with payment status **Unpaid** and their payment method or status suggests liabilities, specifically those linked to \"Account Payable.\"\n\n   From the data:\n\n   Purchases with payment/receipt_status = Unpaid and/or payment_method = Account Payable:\n\n   - Purchase20231231002: Amount = 829,440.0, Unpaid, Account Payable  \n   - Purchase20231231004: Amount = 1,250,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable  \n   - Purchase20231231005: Amount = 246,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable  \n   - Purchase20231231007: Amount = 140,800.0, Unpaid, Account Payable  \n   - Purchase20231231009: Amount = 59,850.0, Unpaid, Account Payable  \n   - Purchase20231231013: Amount = 585,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable  \n   - Purchase20231231014: Amount = 755,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable  \n   - Purchase20231231015: Amount = 59,850.0, Unpaid, Account Payable (note this is the same as above, actually line 15: 59,850 repeated? It's ok, included both.)  \n   - Purchase20231231018: Amount = 402,000.0, Unpaid, Account Payable  \n   - Purchase20231231022: Amount = 19,050.0, Unpaid, Account Payable  \n\n   Also including:\n\n   - Purchase20231231019: Amount = 32,850.0, Unpaid, Account Payable  \n\n   These unpaid purchases represent liabilities.\n\n3. **Sum all unpaid amounts (liaibilities):**\n\n   Adding:\n\n   829,440.0  \n + 1,250,000.0  \n + 246,000.0  \n + 140,800.0  \n + 59,850.0  \n + 585,000.0  \n + 755,000.0  \n + 59,850.0  \n + 402,000.0  \n + 19,050.0  \n + 32,850.0  \n\nCalculate:\n\n- 829,440 + 1,250,000 = 2,079,440  \n- 2,079,440 + 246,000 = 2,325,440  \n- 2,325,440 + 140,800 = 2,466,240  \n- 2,466,240 + 59,850 = 2,526,090  \n- 2,526,090 + 585,000 = 3,111,090  \n- 3,111,090 + 755,000 = 3,866,090  \n- 3,866,090 + 59,850 = 3,925,940  \n- 3,925,940 + 402,000 = 4,327,940  \n- 4,327,940 + 19,050 = 4,346,990  \n- 4,346,990 + 32,850 = 4,379,840  \n\nTherefore, total liabilities from unpaid purchase amounts at the end: **4,379,840.0**\n\n4. **Check if any other liability-related entries**:  \nThere are no other explicit liabilities items (like loans or debts) shown in the data, and initial liabilities were zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final result:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"4379840.00\"}}\n```",
