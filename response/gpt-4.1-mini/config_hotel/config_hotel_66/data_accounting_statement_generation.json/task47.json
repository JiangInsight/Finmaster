                        "content": "To calculate the final ending cash and cash equivalents balance, we will:\n\n1. Identify initial cash and bank deposits as the starting cash balance.\n2. Add cash inflows (cash sales received, receipts in cash).\n3. Subtract cash outflows (expenses paid in cash, purchases paid in cash, transfers out from cash).\n4. Transfers from cash to bank reduce cash but are internal moves to bank accounts, so these reduce cash but not total cash and equivalents. Since bank deposits are included in initial amount and no info about bank transactions, only cash-side transfers impact cash.\n\nWe will carefully accumulate all cash items.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Initial cash and bank deposits**\n\n| type           | payment_method | amount      |\n|----------------|----------------|-------------|\n| Cash deposit   | (none)         | 3,000,000.0 |\n| Bank deposit   | (none)         | 5,000,000.0 |\n\nInitial cash = 3,000,000.0 (cash)\n\nInitial bank = 5,000,000.0 (bank)\n\nNote: Initial Fixed Assets 8,000,000 are not cash equivalents.\n\nWe'll track two components separately and finally sum.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Cash inflows (cash payments received, i.e. sales with Payment/Receipt_Status = Paid and Payment Method = Cash or default to Cash)**\n\n- From sales with \"Paid\" and \"payment_method\" either \"Cash\" or blank (treat blank as non-cash? But in examples, cash sales explicitly mention \"Cash\"; to be conservative, use only those with payment_method = \"Cash\", or \"Cash\" in receive_method for inflow.)\n\nLook at sales rows:\n\n- Sale20240102001: Paid, payment method = \"\" (empty here is ambiguous), but \"receive_method\" = \"Cash\" => Cash inflow of 18,819.04\n- Sale20240102002: Paid, no payment method, receive_method = Cash => 17,329.28\n\nSimilarly identify all such sales:\n\nNow from the problem data (note payment_method in column):\n\nCheck for sales with payment/receipt_status=Paid and payment_method=Cash or receive_method=Cash:\n\nFrom sample data (simplify by payment_method = Cash or receive_method = Cash and status=Paid):\n\nSales Paid with receive_method = Cash:\n\n- Sale20240102001: 18,819.04\n- Sale20240102002: 17,329.28\n- Sale20240103003: 19,664.3\n- Sale20240103004: 12,789.78\n- Sale20240103005: 1,856.24\n- Sale20240104006: 6,734.92\n- Sale20240105008: 28,836.04\n- Sale20240106013: 10,783.4\n- Sale20240106014: 7,996.52\n- Sale20240107017: 1,214.62\n- Sale20240108019: 12,360.2\n- Sale20240108020: 4,343.1\n- Sale20240108021: 20,403.2\n- Sale20240109023: 10,873.75\n- Sale20240109024: 14,031.95\n- Sale20240110026: 10,001.01\n- Sale20240111029: 3,914.92\n- Sale20240111030: 10,298.38\n- Sale20240111031: 20,500.95\n- Sale20240113033: 2,779.58\n- Sale20240113035: 3,096.61\n- Sale20240114036: 1,387.02\n- Sale20240114037: 13,615.08\n- Sale20240114038: 7,087.35\n- Sale20240115041: 13,821.96\n- Sale20240116046: 44,676.85\n- Sale20240117050: 3,853.44\n- Sale20240117051: 13,910.85\n- Sale20240117052: 8,012.08\n- Sale20240118054: 1,420.8\n- Sale20240118055: 3,439.5\n- Sale20240118056: 2,780.94\n- Sale20240119057: 12,763.44\n- Sale20240119058: 17,426.9 (Unpaid -
