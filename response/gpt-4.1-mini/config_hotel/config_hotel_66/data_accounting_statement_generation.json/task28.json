                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify all transactions with the type \"Sales Expenses\" and sum their amounts.\n\nStep-by-step:\n\n1. Inspect the dataset rows.\n2. Extract all rows where `type` is \"Sales Expenses\".\n3. Sum the `amount` values of those rows.\n\nLet's identify the \"Sales Expenses\" rows and sum their amounts:\n\nFrom the problem data extract (filter by type == \"Sales Expenses\") the amounts are:\n\n- 420.21  \n- 207.85  \n- 618.18  \n- 517.59  \n- 420.21 (no repetition, only once above listed)  \n- 207.85 (also no repetition)  \n- 618.18  \n- 517.59  \n- 420.21  \n- 207.85  \n- 618.18  \n- 517.59  \n\nWait, to be precise let's list all \"Sales Expenses\" amounts carefully from the dataset (some of these are repeating in my quick check so need definitive unique picks):\n\nScanning the dataset, the exact entries with \"Sales Expenses\" type and their amounts are:\n\n- Expense20240106001 | Sales Expenses | 420.21  \n- Expense20240106001 | Sales Expenses | 207.85  \n- Expense20240107001 | Sales Expenses | 618.18  \n- Expense20240109001 | Sales Expenses | 517.59  \n- Expense20240114001 | Sales Expenses | 754.0  \n- Expense20240115001 | Sales Expenses | 955.46  \n- Expense20240116001 | Sales Expenses | 208.78  \n- Expense20240117001 | Sales Expenses | 955.46 (appeared twice? No, in 15001 only)  \n- Expense20240117001 | Sales Expenses | 955.46 (only once at 17001)  \n- Expense20240118001 | Sales Expenses | 254.17  \n- Expense20240119001 | Sales Expenses | 517.59 (could be repeated, verify)  \n- Expense20240121001 | Sales Expenses | 620.81  \n- Expense20240122001 | Sales Expenses | 322.6  \n- Expense20240124001 | Sales Expenses | 119.55  \n- Expense20240124001 | Sales Expenses | 442.56  \n- Expense20240125001 | Sales Expenses | 856.79  \n- Expense20240126001 | Sales Expenses | 420.21 (double check if this exists; actually no, this number is from 06001)  \n- Expense20240126001 | Sales Expenses | 17257.26 (Does not appear, this number is not shown as Sales Expense)  \n- Expense20240125001 | Sales Expenses | 32264.01 (this is in example data, not the problem)  \n- Expense20240131001 | Sales Expenses | 354.57  \n\nAfter careful parsing, the amounts for \"Sales Expenses\" in the problem data are:\n\n- 420.21  \n- 207.85  \n- 618.18  \n- 517.59  \n- 754.0  \n- 955.46  \n- 208.78  \n- 254.17  \n- 517.59 (duplicate? It's the same date 2024-01-09, only once present)  \n- 620.81  \n- 322.6  \n- 119.55  \n- 442.56  \n- 856.79  \n- 354.57  \n- 187.66  \n- 141.49  \n\nWait, some sales expenses are from the example data, let's ignore those and focus only on problem data.\n\nRe-extract \"Sales Expenses\" entries from problem data by filtering type=\"Sales Expenses\":\n\nPer problem data, these rows and amounts:\n\n- Expense20240106001 | Sales Expenses | 420.21  \n- Expense20240106001 | Sales Expenses | 207.85  \n- Expense20240107001 | Sales Expenses | 618.18  \n- Expense20240109001 | Sales Expenses | 517.59  \n- Expense20240114001 | Sales Expenses | 754.0  \n- Expense20240115001 | Sales Expenses | 955.46  \n- Expense20240116001 | Sales Expenses | 208.78  \n- Expense20240118001 | Sales Expenses | 254.17  \n- Expense20240121001 | Sales Expenses | 620.81  \n- Expense20240122001 | Sales Expenses | 322.6  \n- Expense20240124001 | Sales Expenses | 119.55  \n- Expense20240124001 | Sales Expenses | 442.56  \n- Expense20240125001 | Sales Expenses | 856.79  \n- Expense20240131001 | Sales Expenses | 354.57  \n- Expense20240112001 | Sales Expenses | 187.66  \n- Expense20240127001 | Sales Expenses | 141.49\n\nThese seem to be all the \"Sales Expenses\" entries.\n\nNow compute the sum:\n\n420.21  \n+ 207.85 = 628.06  \n+ 618.18 = 1246.24  \n+ 517.59 = 1763.83  \n+ 754.00 = 2517.83  \n+ 955.46 = 3473.29  \n+ 208.78 = 3682.07  \n+ 254.17 = 3936.24  \n+ 620.81 = 4557.05  \n+ 322.60 = 4879.65  \n+ 119.55 = 4999.20  \n+ 442.56 = 5441.76  \n+ 856.79 = 6298.55  \n+ 354.57 = 6653.12  \n+ 187.66 = 6840.78  \n+ 141.49 = 6982.27  \n\nTotal sales expenses amount to 6982.27.\n\nTherefore,\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Selling Expenses\": \"6982.27\"}}\n```\n\n# Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Selling Expenses\": \"6982.27\"}}\n```",
