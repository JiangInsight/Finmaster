We look at purchase records or fixed asset purchase records that likely add to non-current assets.\n\nLook for purchases related to assets (usually with product_id starting with \"F\" or \"R\" but especially refer to Fixed Asset purchases):\n\n- Purchases on 2023-12-31 with product_id starting \"F\" (e.g., F004 Banquet Set, F002 Business Meal Set, F003 Deluxe Meal Set) and \"R\" (rooms, likely fixed assets):\n  - Purchase20231231001 | 371,520.0 (F004 Banquet Set)\n  - Purchase20231231002 | 829,440.0 (F004 Banquet Set)\n  - Purchase20231231004 | 1,250,000.0 (R003 Luxury Suite)\n  - Purchase20231231005 | 246,000.0 (R002 Business Room)\n  - Purchase20231231006 | 582,000.0 (R002 Business Room)\n  - Purchase20231231007 | 140,800.0 (F003 Deluxe Meal Set)\n  - Purchase20231231008 | 254,320.0 (F003 Deluxe Meal Set)\n  - Purchase20231231009 | 240,240.0 (F003 Deluxe Meal Set)\n  - Purchase20231231010 | 216,000.0 (R001 Standard Room)\n  - Purchase20231231011 | 540,000.0 (R003 Luxury Suite)\n  - Purchase20231231014 | 755,000.0 (R003 Luxury Suite)\n  - Purchase20231231015 | 59,850.0 (F002 Business Meal Set)\n  - Purchase20231231016 | 820,800.0 (F004 Banquet Set)\n  - Purchase20231231017 | 80,500.0 (F002 Business Meal Set)\n  - Purchase20231231018 | 328,000.0 (R002 Business Room)\n  - Purchase20231231019 | 32,850.0 (F001 Quick Meal Set)\n  - Purchase20231231020 | 36,050.0 (F002 Business Meal Set)\n  - Purchase20231231021 | 35,850.0 (F001 Quick Meal Set)\n  - Purchase20231231022 | 19,050.0 (F001 Quick Meal Set)\n  - Purchase20231231023 | 358,500.0 (R001 Standard Room)\n  - Purchase20231231024 | 402,000.0 (R001 Standard Room)\n\nAdd all these purchase amounts as additions to fixed assets (assuming they are capital expenditures):\n\nSum of all above purchase amounts:\n\n371,520 + 829,440 + 1,250,000 + 246,000 + 582,000 + 140,800 + 254,320 + 240,240 + 216,000 + 540,000 + 755,000 + 59,850 + 820,800 + 80,500 + 328,000 + 32,850 + 36,050 + 35,850 + 19,050 + 358,500 + 402,000\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n371,520  \n+ 829,440 = 1,200,960  \n+ 1,250,000 = 2,450,960  \n+ 246,000 = 2,696,960  \n+ 582,000 = 3,278,960  \n+ 140,800 = 3,419,760  \n+ 254,320 = 3,674,080  \n+ 240,240 = 3,914,320  \n+ 216,000 = 4,130,320  \n+ 540,000 = 4,670,320  \n+ 755,000 = 5,425,320  \n+ 59,850 = 5,485,170  \n+ 820,800 = 6,305,970  \n+ 80,500 = 6,386,470  \n+ 328,000 = 6,714,470  \n+ 32,850 = 6,747,320  \n+ 36,050 = 6,783,370  \n+ 35,850 = 6,819,220  \n+ 19,050 = 6,838,270  \n+ 358,500 = 7,196,770  \n+ 402,000 = 7,598,770\n\nSo total additions from purchases = 7,598,770.00\n\n**Step 3: Calculate accumulated depreciation**\n\nWe have depreciation entries on:\n\n- Depreciation20240101001 | 45,754.08\n- Depreciation20240201002 | 45,755.86\n\nTotal depreciation = 45,754.08 + 45,755.86 = 91,509.94\n\nAssuming no disposals or impairments, depreciation reduces the carrying value of fixed assets.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate ending value of non-current assets**\n\nEnding value = Initial fixed assets + additions - depreciation  \n= 8,000,000 + 7,598,770 - 91,509.94  \n= 15,598,770 - 91,509.94  \n= 15,507,260.06\n\n**Step 5: Format the results to 2 decimal places**\n\n- Total Non-current Assets Initial Value = 8,000,000.00  \n- Total Non-current Assets End Value = 15,507,260.06\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"15507260.06\"}}\n```\n\n# Explanation Summary:\n- Initial fixed assets from initial records = 8 million\n- Add all capitalized purchases (assumed fixed asset purchases) = ~7.6 million\n- Subtract accumulated depreciation = ~91.5k  \n- Resulting in ending net book value of ~15.5 million.",
