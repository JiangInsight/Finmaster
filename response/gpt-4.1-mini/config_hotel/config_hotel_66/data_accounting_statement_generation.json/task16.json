The cash and bank deposit totals (assets) are 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000.\n\nGiven we have only these initial transactions relevant to capital, and no explicit \"Paid-in Capital\" or equity-type entry, the problem example sums all initial \"Initial\" amounts (including Fixed Assets) as paid-in capital.\n\nThus:\n\n- Total Initial Paid-in Capital = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 16,000,000.00\n\n### Step 2: Check subsequent transactions for changes to Paid-in Capital\n\nWe look for any transactions that increase or decrease equity/capital after 2023-12-31:\n\n- No entries specifying new capital injections or owner withdrawals appear in the data.\n\n- All purchases, sales, expenses, interest, and depreciation have either asset, expense, or revenue impact, but none impacting paid-in capital directly.\n\nTherefore, the ending paid-in capital remains unchanged.\n\n### Final Result:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\", \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"16000000.00\"}}\n````",
