Identify the initial fixed assets value from the initial records.\n2. Add any fixed assets purchases.\n3. Subtract any depreciation charges.\n4. Consider no disposals or other adjustments mentioned in the data.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Fixed Assets Value\n\n- From the initial record (type: Fixed Assets) at date 2023-12-31:\n  - Initial Fixed Assets = 8,000,000.0\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Fixed Assets Purchases\n\n- Look for purchase transactions related to fixed assets.\n- The problem data does not explicitly have a separate \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" type as in the example,\n  but we can observe purchase transactions with product_id like F004 (Banquet Set), R003 (Luxury Suite), etc.\n- However, these are banquet sets, business rooms, luxury suites etc., which likely are fixed assets.\n  \n- We consider any purchase entries that seem like fixed assets. Usually, fixed assets purchases are capitalized and should add to fixed assets.\n- From the data, the purchases related to fixed assets are those with the product_id starting with \"F\" (furniture) or \"R\" (rooms, suites) that are likely fixed assets.\n\n- Let's sum all \"Purchase\" amounts with product_id starting with F or R:\n  \nPurchases from data:\n\n| Purchase ID      | Amount    | Product ID | Product Name       |\n|------------------|-----------|------------|--------------------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | 371,520   | F004       | Banquet Set        |\n| Purchase20231231002 | 829,440   | F004       | Banquet Set        |\n| Purchase20231231003 | 35,000    | F002       | Business Meal Set  |\n| Purchase20231231004 | 1,250,000 | R003       | Luxury Suite       |\n| Purchase20231231005 | 246,000   | R002       | Business Room      |\n| Purchase20231231006 | 582,000   | R002       | Business Room      |\n| Purchase20231231007 | 140,800   | F003       | Deluxe Meal Set    |\n| Purchase20231231008 | 254,320   | F003       | Deluxe Meal Set    |\n| Purchase20231231009 | 240,240   | F003       | Deluxe Meal Set    |\n| Purchase20231231010 | 216,000   | R001       | Standard Room      |\n| Purchase20231231014 | 755,000   | R003       | Luxury Suite       |\n| Purchase20231231015 | 59,850    | F002       | Business Meal Set  |\n| Purchase20231231016 | 820,800   | F004       | Banquet Set        |\n| Purchase20231231017 | 80,500    | F002       | Business Meal Set  |\n| Purchase20231231018 | 328,000   | R002       | Business Room      |\n| Purchase20231231019 | 32,850    | F001       | Quick Meal Set     |\n| Purchase20231231020 | 36,050    | F002       | Business Meal Set  |\n| Purchase20231231021 | 35,850    | F001       | Quick Meal Set     |\n| Purchase20231231022 | 19,050    | F001       | Quick Meal Set     |\n| Purchase20231231023 | 358,500   | R001       | Standard Room      |\n| Purchase20231231024 | 402,000   | R001       | Standard Room      |\n\nThere is also Purchase20231231011 (540,000) and Purchase20231231013 (585,000) and others in initial data with similar pattern:\n\n| Purchase20231231011 | 540,000 | R003       | Luxury Suite       |\n| Purchase20231231013 | 585,000 | R003       | Luxury Suite       |\n\nCheck \"Unpaid\" or \"Paid\", but for fixed assets purchases, both paid and unpaid can be capitalized.\n\nSum all purchase amounts above:\n\nCalculate sum:\n\n371,520 + 829,440 + 35,000 + 1,250,000 + 246,000 + 582,000 + 140,800 + 254,320 + 240,240 + 216,000 + 755,000 + 59,850 + 820,800 + 80,500 + 328,000 + 32,850 + 36,050 + 35,850 + 19,050 + 358,500 + 402,000 + 540,000 + 585,000\n\nLet's add stepwise:\n\n- 371,520 + 829,440 = 1,200,960\n- 1,200,960 + 35,000 = 1,235,960\n- 1,235,960 + 1,250,000 = 2,485,960\n- 2,485,960 + 246,000 = 2,731,960\n- 2,731,960 + 582,000 = 3,313,960\n- 3,313,960 + 140,800 = 3,454,760\n- 3,454,760 + 254,320 = 3,709,080\n- 3,709,080 + 240,240 = 3,949,320\n- 3,949,320 + 216,000 = 4,165,320\n- 4,165,320 + 755,000 = 4,920,320\n- 4,920,320 + 59,850 = 4,980,170\n- 4,980,170 + 820,800 = 5,800,970\n- 5,800,970 + 80,500 = 5,881,470\n- 5,881,470 + 328,000 = 6,209,470\n- 6,209,470 + 32,850 = 6,242,320\n- 6,242,320 + 36,050 = 6,278,370\n- 6,278,370 + 35,850 = 6,314,220\n- 6,314,220 + 19,050 = 6,333,270\n- 6,333,270 + 358,500 = 6,691,770\n- 6,691,770 + 402,000 = 7,093,770\n- 7,093,770 + 540,000 = 7,633,770\n- 7,633,770 + 585,000 = 8,218,770\n\nTotal fixed asset purchases = 8,218,770\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Depreciation\n\n- Sum of depreciation amounts:\n\nThere are two depreciation entries in data:\n\n- Depreciation20240101001: 45,754.08\n- Depreciation20240201002: 45,755.86\n\nSum depreciation:\n\n45,754.08 + 45,755.86 = 91,509.94\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Fixed Assets Value Calculation\n\nFinal Fixed Assets = Initial Fixed Assets + Purchases - Depreciation\n\n= 8,000,000 + 8,218,770 - 91,509.94  \n= 16,218,770 - 91,509.94  \n= 16,127,260.06\n\n(Note: The big jump in purchases is based on all purchase transactions noted; this assumes all are capitalized fixed assets)\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"16127260.06\"\n  }\n}\n````",
