Most likely the correct value is $5,000,000. This seems a data entry error.\n\n2. **Sale20240114038:**  \n   - Recorded unit price is 2130.74. Given recorded_amount of 7087.35 with 3 units sold, the unit price should be 7087.35 / 3 = 2362.45 as stated in the invoice text. Recorded unit price is an error.\n\n3. **Sale20240125044:**  \n   - Recorded unit price is 24944.5 but invoice states it should be 24990.5.\n\n4. **Sale20240131099:**  \n   - Although profit is not explicitly flagged as wrong, checked calculations found it consistent. No inconsistency flagged here; included to confirm correctness.\n\nNo other discrepancies were detected in the given dataset among the sampled entries.\n\nNote: Some transactions have very consistent fields matching invoice totals; discrepancies are mostly in unit prices where total amounts and quantities do not match the unit price, or in amounts significantly different from related records.",
