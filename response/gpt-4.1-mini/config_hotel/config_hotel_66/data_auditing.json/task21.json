The invoice should be the more reliable source.\n\n- The first sale matches the invoice more closely with unit price * quantity = 4704.76 * 4 = 18819.04, which matches recorded_amount.\n\n- The second entry's unit price * quantity = 4332.32 * 4 = 17329.28 matches its recorded_amount, but it's inconsistent with the invoice and with Sale20240102001 (which totals 18819.04 for 4 units).\n\n- Therefore the Sale20240102002's recorded_unit_price, recorded_amount, recorded_tax_amount, and recorded_profit fields are inconsistent.\n\n- Best estimate of correct values (based on invoice and matching sales data) are from Sale20240102001's data (unit price 4704.76, amount 18819.04, tax 940.95, profit 7299.04).\n\n- Recorded preparer and approver \"Director\" are consistent and no changes suggested.\n\n- Hence, the \"Recorded price\", \"Recorded amount\", \"Recorded tax\", and \"Recorded profit\" should be corrected to the original estimated values.\n\nNote: Other transactions appear consistent from the data given; no other clear inconsistencies found.
