The last one (Fixed Assets) originally showed 5,000,000.0 in the example but now shows 8,000,000.0 in the problem.\n- Since the invoice is considered more reliable and the problem narrative states \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Fixed Assets, totaling $8000000.00\", the recorded amount of Fixed Assets should be corrected to 8,000,000.0 instead of 5,000,000.0.\n- No other inconsistencies were identified in the provided data sample for these transactions.\n```",
