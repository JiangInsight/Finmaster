As no discrepancy is identified here, the best estimate matches the recorded values.\n- Therefore, the output marks all relevant fields as unchanged and consistent.\n\nIf you want me to analyze all records and find inconsistencies with corrected values, please specify; this answer addresses the first example consistent with the instructions.",
