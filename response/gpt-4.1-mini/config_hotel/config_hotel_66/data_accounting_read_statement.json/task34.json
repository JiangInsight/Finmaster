Both have the same amount 863371.65.  \n- Usually \"Total Revenue\" is the total income from ordinary activities, so we take \"Total Revenue\": 863371.65.\n\nStep 2: Identify the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.  \n- Typically corresponds to \"Cost of Goods Sold\" or similar. Here \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is 562950.00.\n\nStep 3: Identify costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole.  \n- Typically refers to \"Administrative Expenses\". Here \"Administrative Expenses\" is 16809.11.\n\nSo the answer is:  \n- value1: '863371.65'  (Total Revenue)  \n- value2: '562950.00'  (Cost of Goods Sold)  \n- value3: '16809.11'   (Administrative Expenses)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '863371.65', 'value2': '562950.00', 'value3': '16809.11'}}\n```",
