                        "content": "Let's identify the required values step by step:\n\n1. From the **Balance Sheet**, we need the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares.  \n   - This corresponds to **Paid-in Capital**.  \n   - Value: **16000000.00**\n\n2. From the **Income Statement**, we need the end value of profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense.  \n   - This corresponds to **Profit Before Tax**.  \n   - Value: **189296.19**\n\n3. From the **Balance Sheet**, we need the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.  \n   - This corresponds to the increase in **Accounts Payable** (liability the company owes for credit purchases).  \n   - Initial was 0.00, end amount is 5472810.00, so increase = 5472810.00.  \n   - Value: **5472810.00**\n\nThe question asks to group by financial statement order:  \n1. Balance Sheet: Paid-in Capital and Accounts Payable (but only one value is required from balance sheet and that is capital contributed by shareholders), and the addition in amount owed is also from Balance Sheet: specifically \"addition in the amount owed by the entity\" → accounts payable increase is the target value. The problem states for multiple outputs, group them by financial statement in order: 1. Balance Sheet 2. Income Statement 3. Cash Flow Statement. However, there's no requirement to include cash flow statement data in this problem (the addition in accounts payable comes from balance sheet). So according to the example and prompt:\n\n- value1: Capital contributed by shareholders (Balance Sheet) → Paid-in Capital  \n- value2: Profit or loss before tax (Income Statement) → Profit Before Tax  \n- value3: Addition in amount owed (Balance Sheet → Accounts Payable increase)\n\nLooking again at the example, the \"value3\" corresponded to accounts payable change from balance sheet data (ending amount since initial is 0). So we proceed similarly.\n\nTherefore,\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16000000.00', 'value2': '189296.19', 'value3': '5472810.00'}}\n```\n\n# Final answer:  \n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16000000.00', 'value2': '189296.19', 'value3': '5472810.00'}}\n```",
