                        "content": "To identify costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services to customers, typically these costs are reflected in:\n\n- Selling Expenses: related to marketing, selling, and distribution.\n- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): directly related to producing and delivering goods/services.\n\nAdministrative Expenses are usually not directly related to securing or delivering customer orders.\n\nGiven the problem data:\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 562,950.00 (cost to produce/deliver goods)\n- Selling Expenses = 7,553.67 (costs to secure customer orders and sell/deliver)\n  \nSince the task is to identify and extract line items and their values that correspond to costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services, these two lines cover both aspects:\n\n- Selling Expenses (securing orders and selling)\n- Cost of Goods Sold (delivering goods/services)\n\nHowever, the example solution only picks one value (like Selling Expenses in the example). The instructions say \"identify and extract specific line items and value of costs incurred,\" so it's best to mention both.\n\nBut the question example answer gives one value (493854.67 for Selling Expenses) only. Hence, it may be better to output the Selling Expenses line as the \"costs to secure customer orders\" and Cost of Goods Sold as \"costs to deliver goods and services.\"\n\nTherefore, output the sum of both or both separately?\n\nThe problem asks for \"specific line items and value of costs incurred\" => So best to provide the sum or at least clarify.\n\nGiven the example only gave one line's value, here is a conservative approach:\n\n- Since Selling Expenses are explicitly related to securing orders and delivery efforts (distribution), we focus on Selling Expenses.\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold is the actual cost of producing/delivering goods.\n\nSo combining both reflects complete costs incurred to secure and deliver.\n\nSum = 562,950.00 + 7,553.67 = 570,503.67\n\nAlternatively, we could provide an answer with both line items separately.\n\nBut the instruction format is just a value and the example provides one value only.\n\nTherefore, I will provide the combined value.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"570503.67\"}}\n```\n\n# Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"570503.67\"}}\n```",
