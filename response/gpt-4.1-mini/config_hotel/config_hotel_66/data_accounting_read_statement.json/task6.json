The task is to identify tangible items held for use in production, supply of goods or services, rental to others, or for administrative purposes.\n2. Typically, this refers to \"Fixed Assets\" or Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) in the balance sheet.\n3. From the provided balance sheet:\n   - Fixed Assets have an initial amount of 8,000,000.00 on 2023-12-31.\n   - Fixed Assets have an end amount of 8,000,000.00 on 2024-02-01.\n4. Accumulated Depreciation is 0 initially and 91,509.94 at the end, which would reduce the net book value of fixed assets, but since the question asks for initial and final values of tangible items, the gross value (Fixed Assets) is used here.\n5. Therefore, the initial and end values of tangible items are the \"Fixed Assets\" amounts.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"8000000.00\"}}\n```",
