Core operating activities income typically comes from the revenue generated by the main business operations.\n2. From the given income statement, the \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\" show the income from operating activities.\n3. Here, \"Main Business Revenue\" is 863371.65, which aligns with \"Total Revenue.\"\n4. Other items like \"Interest Income\" and \"Profit Before Tax\" include non-operating and comprehensive income metrics, not purely from core operations.\n5. Therefore, the value related to income arising from core operating activities is 863371.65.\n\nThe solution is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"863371.65\"} }\n```",
