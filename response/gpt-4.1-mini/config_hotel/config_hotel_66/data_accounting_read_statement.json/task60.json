The value of funds deposited into a bank.\n2. The income earned by the entity from financial assets.\n\nWe need to extract these values from the financial statements given, and if there are multiple outputs, group them by financial statement in this order:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nWithin each group, maintain the original line item order.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Identify the line item related to funds deposited into a bank**\n\n- From the **Balance Sheet**, the line \"Bank Deposits\" clearly represents funds deposited into a bank.\n- Its end value is: **2698390.00**\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify the line item related to income earned from financial assets**\n\n- Typically, \"Interest Income\" or \"Interest Receivable\" represents income earned from financial assets.\n- From the **Income Statement**, there is \"Interest Income\" with the value: **9066.78**\n- From the **Balance Sheet**, \"Interest Receivable\" is 9066.78 (same as income statement).\n- Since the instruction says to group outputs by financial statement and keep the line item order, we should output these as:\n\n  - From Balance Sheet: Bank Deposits and Interest Receivable\n  - From Income Statement: Interest Income\n\nBut the instruction says to extract two specific line items and the end value of funds deposited and income earned by the entity from financial assets. The income earned is found in Income Statement as \"Interest Income\" and in Balance Sheet as \"Interest Receivable\". Both values are the same (9066.78). The prompt example showed extracting \"Bank Deposits\" from Balance Sheet and \"Interest Income\" from Income Statement.\n\nThus, to follow the sample, we choose:\n\n- \"Bank Deposits\" (Balance Sheet) → 2698390.00\n- \"Interest Income\" (Income Statement) → 9066.78\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Form the solution**\n\nAccording to the prompt's sample output, only the values are listed in `'value1'` and `'value2'`, without the line item names. The extraction is:\n\n- value1: Bank Deposits end value = \"2698390.00\"\n- value2: Interest Income amount = \"9066.78\"\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"2698390.00\", \"value2\": \"9066.78\"}}\n```",
