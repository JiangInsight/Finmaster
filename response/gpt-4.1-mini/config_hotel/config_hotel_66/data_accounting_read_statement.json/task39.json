Here the value is negative, meaning inventory increased rather than decreased, so there is no reduction shown.\n\nStep 5: However, the problem is to extract the value of reduction — if there is no positive value, then the reduction value is zero or not applicable.\n\nStep 6: But since the line precisely named \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" represents the net change in assets held for sale or in production for sale (inventory), we must output the value as is, as the reduction in assets held for sale is negative (actually an increase).\n\nStep 7: The question wording: \"reduction in the amount of assets...\" means a decrease in inventory, which would be a positive value here—there is none.\n\nStep 8: The example given handles a negative value, so it seems we can directly take the inventory value.\n\nHence, the solution is the value on \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" line:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-7832820.00\"}}\n```\n\n# Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-7832820.00\"}}\n```",
