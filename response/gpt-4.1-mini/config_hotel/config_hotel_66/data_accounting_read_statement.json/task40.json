The task is to identify the specific line item and value that represents the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.\n\n2. This typically corresponds to the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" in a cash flow statement, because accounts payable represents amounts owed to suppliers or vendors.\n\n3. In the problem's cash flow, the relevant line is:  \n   | Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 5472810.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n\n4. The positive number indicates an increase in accounts payable, meaning the entity owes more for the goods/services purchased on credit.\n\nHence, the value to extract is \"5472810.00\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"5472810.00\"}}\n```",
