Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers:\n   - These are typically found in the income statement under expenses related to selling or administrative activities.\n   - From the income statement, the relevant line items are \"Selling Expenses\" and \"Administrative Expenses\".\n   - Of those two, \"Selling Expenses\" best represents costs to secure and deliver to customers.\n\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets:\n   - Represented by the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" or similar line items in the Cash Flow Statement under investing activities.\n   - Here, in the cash flow statement, the relevant line is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n\n---\n\nStep by step:\n\n- From the income statement:\n  - Selling Expenses = 7553.67 (costs to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services)\n  \n- From the cash flow statement:\n  - Purchase of Fixed Assets = 0.00 (cash payments to acquire property, plant, equipment, and other long-term assets)\n\nNo relevant line item in Balance Sheet fits these criteria directly.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"7553.67\", \"value2\": \"0.00\"}}\n```\n",
