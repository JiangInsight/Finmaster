                        "content": "To identify the value of decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit, we look for the line item related to \"Accounts Receivable\" in the cash flow statement.\n\nFrom the given data:\n- The relevant line is: \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\"\n- The amount is: -330748.44\n\nSince this is a negative number, it indicates an increase in accounts receivable, meaning amounts owed to the entity have increased, not decreased. However, the task asks for the \"decrease\" in such amounts. If there was a decrease, the number would be positive.\n\nBut the description says to \"identify and extract the specific line items and value of decrease in amounts owed to the entity.\" The line item is already the one that tracks changes in receivables (amounts owed) – the negative number here represents a decrease in cash (or increase in owed amounts), so it's a negative cash flow.\n\nSince the line item is the correct one, and the amount is given directly, despite being negative, this is the correct extraction of the value \"decrease in amounts owed.\"\n\nThe problem states to extract the value of decrease in amounts owed – the line is already named \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable,\" and negative amount means an increase in accounts receivable (more owed), positive means decrease.\n\nHence:\n\nAmount owed to the entity decreased if the value in this row is positive.\n\nGiven it is negative (-330748.44), amounts owed increased, so strictly the decrease in amounts owed is zero or none.\n\nTherefore, since this is an amount owed to the entity on credit, the decrease is zero or none.\n\nBut the task is to extract the specific line item and value. Since the only relevant line item is this one, the decrease amount is 0 or no decrease.\n\nAlternatively, task may want the line item and the amount given as is.\n\nBut in the example, they gave the negative value '-2429482.13' as the value in solution.\n\nSo following the example's logic, we just output the value as is.\n\nTherefore,\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-330748.44\"}}\n```\n\n# Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-330748.44\"}}\n```",
