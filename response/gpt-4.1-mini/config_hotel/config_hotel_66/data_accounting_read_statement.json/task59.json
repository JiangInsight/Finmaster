The amount of \"interest accrued but not yet received\" - typically found in the Balance Sheet or Income Statement by items like \"Interest Receivable\" or \"Interest Income\".\n2. The net addition (net increase or net change) in \"cash and cash equivalents\" during the period - usually found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Net Increase\" or \"Net Change\" in Cash and Cash Equivalents.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Locate the \"interest accrued but not yet received\"\n\n- From the **Balance Sheet**, the line item \"Interest Receivable\" shows the end amount as **9066.78**.\n- From the **Income Statement**, \"Interest Income\" is **9066.78** as well.\n- From the **Cash Flow Statement**, \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" is **-9066.78** (which represents a cash outflow related to interest receivable increase).\n\nThe best representation of \"interest accrued but not yet received\" is the **Interest Receivable** value from the Balance Sheet end amount, which is **9066.78**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Locate the \"net addition in cash and cash equivalents\"\n\n- From the **Cash Flow Statement** under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section:\n\n  - Beginning Balance = 8,000,000.00\n  - Ending Balance = 5,580,980.91\n  - Net Increase = -2,419,019.09\n\nThe \"Net Increase\" indicates a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the period of **-2,419,019.09**.\n\n---\n\n### Final extracted values:\n\n- Value 1 (interest accrued but not yet received): **9066.78**\n- Value 2 (net addition in cash and cash equivalents): **-2419019.09**\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"9066.78\", \"value2\": \"-2419019.09\"}}\n```",
