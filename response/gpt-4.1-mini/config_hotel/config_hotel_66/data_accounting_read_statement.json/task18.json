In the example solution given, only \"Cash on Hand\" was selected for cash (the first line item).\n\n- Tangible items held for use in production or administrative purposes: this is usually \"Fixed Assets\".\n\n- Amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid: this is \"Taxes Payable\".\n\nStep 2: Extract their initial and end values from the given balance sheet:\n\n- Cash on Hand: Initial_amount = 3000000.00, End_amount = 2882590.91\n\n- Fixed Assets: Initial_amount = 8000000.00, End_amount = 8000000.00\n\n- Taxes Payable: Initial_amount = 0.00, End_amount = 43168.61\n\nStep 3: Present in the requested JSON format, maintaining line item order as shown in problem:\n\nThe line item order is Cash on Hand, Fixed Assets, Taxes Payable.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '3000000.00', 'end valu1': '2882590.91', 'initial value2': '8000000.00', 'end valu2': '8000000.00', 'initial value3': '0.00', 'end valu3': '43168.61'}}\n```\n\nFinal answer below.",
