From the balance sheet provided, the relevant line items include:\n- Cash on Hand\n- Bank Deposits\n- Interest Receivable\n- Accounts Receivable\n- Inventory\n\nHowever, the line \"Total Current Assets\" already summarizes these amounts.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Initial total current assets (expected to be realized/consumed during the normal operating cycle): 8,000,000.00\n2. End total current assets as of 2024-02-01: 13,753,616.13\n\nTherefore, the total assets expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption include the \"Total Current Assets\" line item with the above values.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"13753616.13\"} }\n```",
