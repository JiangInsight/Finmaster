Costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services to customers are typically recorded under \"Selling Expenses.\"  \n   - From the problem: Selling Expenses = 7553.67\n\n2. The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life is \"Depreciation.\"  \n   - From the problem: Depreciation = 91509.94\n\n3. Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation are \"Financial Expenses.\"  \n   - From the problem: Financial Expenses = 4319.52\n\n4. The total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period is \"Tax Expense.\"  \n   - From the problem: Tax Expense = 43168.61\n\nMaintaining the original order from the statement for multiple outputs, the four values correspond to:\n\n- Selling Expenses (value1)\n- Depreciation (value2)\n- Financial Expenses (value3)\n- Tax Expense (value4)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '7553.67', 'value2': '91509.94', 'value3': '4319.52', 'value4': '43168.61'} }\n```",
