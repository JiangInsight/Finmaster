But this is less than 1, yet generally Quick Ratio includes Accounts Receivable and excludes Inventory. Let's check again carefully:\n\nQuick Assets:  \n- Cash on Hand: 2,105,753.37  \n- Bank Deposits: 559,055.66  \n- Interest Receivable: 6,494.02  \n- Accounts Receivable: 335,639.38  \nSum: 2,105,753.37 + 559,055.66 + 6,494.02 + 335,639.38 = 3,007,942.43  \n\nCurrent Liabilities: 5,637,910.70  \nQuick Ratio = 3,007,942.43 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ 0.5339  \n\nThis is below 1 which suggests weak liquidity. The previous value of 1.23 must have come from including Inventory by mistake.\n\nRe-examining the problem, in your data:\n\n- Total Current Assets: 10,453,882.43  \n- Inventory: 7,446,940.00  \nQuick Assets = Total Current Assets - Inventory = 10,453,882.43 - 7,446,940.00 = 3,006,942.43 (close to our manual calculation)  \nSo Quick Ratio = 3,006,942.43 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ 0.5339 (round 0.53)\n\nCorrect value is 0.53, not 1.23.\n\n---\n\n5. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**  \n= Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities  \n= -1,919,526.63 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ -0.34 (same as Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio)\n\n---\n\n6. **Return on Equity (ROE)**  \n= Net Profit / Average Owner's Equity  \nBeginning Equity = 16,000,000.00 (Initial_amount)  \nEnding Equity = 16,099,532.29 (End_amount)  \nAverage Equity = (16,000,000 + 16,099,532.29)/2 = 16,049,766.15  \nNet Profit = 99,532.29  \nROE = 99,532.29 / 16,049,766.15 ≈ 0.0062 = 0.62%\n\n---\n\n7. **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio**  \n= Net Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \nBeginning AR = 0.00   \nEnding AR = 335,639.38  \nAverage AR = (0 + 335,639.38) / 2 = 167,819.69  \nNet Revenue = 836,813.79  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover = 836,813.79 / 167,819.69 ≈ 4.99\n\nCheck the example, they used the ending AR only (or average AR) depends on data availability. Here average AR is preferable.\n\n---\n\n**Final corrections:**\n\n- Quick Ratio: 0.53 (not 1.23)  \n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: 4.99 (not 2.49)\n\n---\n\n**Updated final answers:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.34\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.35\",\n  \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.04\",\n  \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.53\",\n  \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.34\",\n  \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"0.62%\",\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"4.99\"\n}}\n```",
