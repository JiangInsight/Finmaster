The negative or odd interest receivable amounts are not flagged here because they likely signify special financial events (such as adjustments) rather than data errors.  \n\nDate discrepancies or duplicate entries with different dates given in the problem are also not part of this specific input problem to report.\n\nHence only the Fixed Asset amount discrepancy is flagged here for this input.",
