                        "content": "Let's identify the three requested values step-by-step from the provided financial statements:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet - Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares\n\n- This is typically **\"Paid-in Capital\"**.\n- From the Balance Sheet table:\n\n| Account | End_amount |\n| --- | --- |\n| Paid-in Capital | 16000000.00 |\n\nSo, **value1 = \"16000000.00\"**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Income Statement - End value of profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense\n\n- This is **\"Profit Before Tax\"**.\n- From the Income Statement table:\n\n| Account | Amount |\n| --- | --- |\n| Profit Before Tax | 141372.99 |\n\nSo, **value2 = \"141372.99\"**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Balance Sheet - Addition in amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period\n\n- This corresponds to the increase in **\"Accounts Payable\"**.\n- From the Balance Sheet table:\n\n| Account | End_amount |\n| --- | --- |\n| Accounts Payable | 5596070.00 |\n\nThe initial amount was 0.00, ending at 5596070.00, so the addition is 5596070.00.\n\nSo, **value3 = \"5596070.00\"**\n\n---\n\n### Final organized answer by requested order:\n\n1. Balance Sheet:\n   - Paid-in Capital = 16000000.00\n   - Accounts Payable = 5596070.00\n\n2. Income Statement:\n   - Profit Before Tax = 141372.99\n\nBut the problem asks to group outputs by financial statement in this order: 1) Balance Sheet 2) Income Statement 3) Cash Flow Statement.\n\nFor the \"addition in amount owed\" it is from Balance Sheet (Accounts Payable), so it belongs to Balance Sheet group.\n\nHence the values will be:\n\n- value1: Capital contributed by shareholders (Balance Sheet - Paid-in Capital) = 16000000.00\n- value2: Profit Before Tax (Income Statement) = 141372.99\n- value3: Addition in amount owed (Balance Sheet - Accounts Payable) = 5596070.00\n\n---\n\n### Note on cash flow statement\n\nThe addition in amount owed (Accounts Payable) is on balance sheet but could also appear as an increase in cash flow from operating activities in cash flow statement (Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable). But the problem clearly asks to extract from all statements and group by statement.\n\nSo since Accounts Payable is on Balance sheet, we provide it from there.\n\n---\n\n### Final JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"16000000.00\", \"value2\": \"141372.99\", \"value3\": \"5596070.00\"}}\n```\n",
