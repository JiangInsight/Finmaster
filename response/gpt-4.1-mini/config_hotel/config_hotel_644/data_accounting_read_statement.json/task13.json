This typically refers to **non-current assets** (such as fixed assets, property, plant, equipment), since current assets are expected to be realized or consumed within the operating cycle.\n\nFrom the problem data, the relevant accounts are:\n\n- Total Current Assets (expected to be realized or consumed in normal course)\n- Total Non-current Assets (not expected to be realized in normal operating cycle)\n- Total Assets\n\nGiven that, the line items not expected to be realized or intended for sale/consumption are within **Total Non-current Assets**.\n\nAccordingly:\n\n- Initial value (at 2023-12-31) of Total Non-current Assets: 8000000.00\n- End value (at 2024-02-01) of Total Non-current Assets: 11283560.56\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"11283560.56\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"11283560.56\"}}\n```",
