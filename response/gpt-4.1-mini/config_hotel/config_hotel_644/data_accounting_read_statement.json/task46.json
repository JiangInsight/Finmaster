The task is to identify and extract the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities related to:\n   - Acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments NOT included in cash equivalents.\n   - The receipt of interest and dividends.\n\n2. From the problem's cash flow statement, the closest relevant section is \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" which typically includes acquisition and disposal of long-term assets.\n\n3. The line items under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" are:\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 3,415,664.34 (positive number, meaning cash outflow)\n   - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -3,415,664.34 (negative number, indicating net outflow)\n\n4. There is no explicit line item for receipt of interest and dividends in the provided statement. So the only relevant sub-item available is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\n5. The net cash flow from investing activities is negative (-3,415,664.34), meaning a cash outflow related to acquisition of long-term assets.\n\nHence:\n\n- The total net value is -3,415,664.34\n- The single sub-item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = 3,415,664.34 (itâ€™s the amount paid, outflow)\n\nSince we need the net amount of cash generated (which is typically signed), we keep the negative sign for net total.\n\nAlso, instructions ask to decompose the item into 1 component sub-items all from the input statement, output its final value.\n\nFormatting the answer according to instructions:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-3415664.34\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"3415664.34\"}}\n```\n\n# Final answer follows.",
