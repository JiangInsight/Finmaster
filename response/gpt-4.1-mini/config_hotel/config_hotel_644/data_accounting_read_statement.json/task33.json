The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- The core operating income is typically reflected by the main revenue related to the main business activities, labeled here as \"Main Business Revenue\".\n- The carrying amount of inventories sold corresponds to \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n\nFrom the problem data:\n\n| Account             | Amount   |\n|---------------------|----------|\n| Main Business Revenue| 836813.79|\n| Cost of Goods Sold   | 544970.00|\n\nTherefore:\n\n- value1 (income arising in course of core operating activities) = 836813.79\n- value2 (carrying amount of inventories sold) = 544970.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '836813.79', 'value2': '544970.00'} }\n```",
