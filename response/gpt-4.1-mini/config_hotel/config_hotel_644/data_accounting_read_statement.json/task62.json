Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit.\n2. Financing costs incurred to raise funds for production and operation.\n3. Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\nWe need to group them by financial statement order:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify amounts owed to the entity (Accounts receivable or similar) - Balance Sheet\n\n- **Balance Sheet**: The line item representing amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold/provided on credit is typically **\"Accounts Receivable\"** or similar.\n\nFrom the balance sheet section:\n\n| Account | End_amount |  \n| --- | --- |  \n| Accounts Receivable | 335639.38 |\n\nSo `value1` is '335639.38'.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify financing costs - Income Statement\n\n- Financing costs are interest or other costs incurred to raise funds - often labeled as **\"Financial Expenses\"** or **\"Interest Expense\"**.\n\nFrom the income statement section:\n\n| Account | Amount |  \n| --- | --- |  \n| Financial Expenses | 2675.27 |\n\nSo `value2` is '2675.27'.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Identify cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment or long-term assets - Cash Flow Statement\n\n- Cash payments to acquire property or long-term assets are often listed under investing activities as **\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\"** or similar.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement section:\n\n| Account | Amount |  \n| --- | --- |  \n| Purchase of Fixed Assets | 3415664.34 |\n\nSo `value3` is '3415664.34'.\n\n---\n\n### Final output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"335639.38\", \"value2\": \"2675.27\", \"value3\": \"3415664.34\"} }\n```",
