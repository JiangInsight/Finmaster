This typically corresponds to the change in Accounts Receivable.\n\nIn the provided data, the relevant line is:  \n\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -335639.38 | 2024-02-01\"\n\nThis line shows a negative amount, which means an increase in accounts receivable (more amounts owed to the entity), so there is no decrease in accounts receivable here. However, the task asks specifically for the \"value of decrease in amounts owed to the entity,\" so we take this line item as the relevant one to extract value from.\n\nTherefore, the solution value is the amount in \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" line:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-335639.38'}}\n```",
