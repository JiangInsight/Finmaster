The end value of funds deposited into a bank (typically \"Bank Deposits\")  \n2. The income earned by the entity from financial assets (specifically, \"Interest Income\")\n\nWe proceed by looking at each financial statement in order of preference:  \n1. Balance Sheet  \n2. Income Statement  \n3. Cash Flow Statement (if necessary)\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Balance Sheet\n\nLook for line related to funds deposited into a bank:  \n- \"Bank Deposits\" line exists, with End_amount = 559055.66 (as of 2024-02-01)\n\nThis is the first required value.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Income Statement\n\nLook for line representing income earned from financial assets:  \n- \"Interest Income\" line exists, Amount = 6494.02 (as of 2024-02-01)\n\nThis is the second required value.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"559055.66\", \"value2\": \"6494.02\"}}\n```",
