The costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services to customers.  \n   - These costs are usually reflected in operating expenses, often under \"Selling Expenses\" or similar accounts in the Income Statement.\n   - From the income statement, relevant line items are:\n     - Administrative Expenses: 13300.90\n     - Selling Expenses: 8884.87  \n   - The costs to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services are more typically included in \"Selling Expenses.\"  \n   - So, **value1** is \"Selling Expenses\": 8884.87.\n\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.  \n   - This is given in the Cash Flow Statement under investing activities as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n   - From cash flow:\n     - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 3415664.34  \n   - So, **value2** is: 3415664.34.\n\nNo relevant line items in the balance sheet directly reflect these two specific costs.\n\nHence the extraction grouped as per instructions is:\n\n- Income Statement: Selling Expenses = 8884.87  \n- Cash Flow Statement: Purchase of Fixed Assets = 3415664.34  \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"8884.87\", \"value2\": \"3415664.34\"}}\n```",
