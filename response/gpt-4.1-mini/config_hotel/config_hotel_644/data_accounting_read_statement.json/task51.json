Typically, this corresponds to \"Interest Receivable\" in financial statements.\n\nStep 2: From the balance sheet:\n- Interest Receivable at initial date (2023-12-31) = 0.00\n- Interest Receivable at end date (2024-02-01) = 6494.02\n\nStep 3: This value is consistent with the \"Interest Income\" shown in the income statement (6494.02) and the \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" in cash flow (-6494.02), confirming that the accrued interest amount increased to 6494.02.\n\nHence:\n- initial value is 0.00\n- end value is 6494.02\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '6494.02'} }\n```\n",
