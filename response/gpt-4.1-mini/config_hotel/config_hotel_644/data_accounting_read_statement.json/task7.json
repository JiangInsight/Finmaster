However, the relevant changes influencing \"Retained Earnings\" typically reflect net income or loss after expenses are accounted for.\n\nStep 3: Among the given items, \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is an expense-related account showing the total depreciation charged over time, which impacts profit or loss.\n\nStep 4: From the data:\n- Initial value of Accumulated Depreciation: 0.00 (2023-12-31)\n- End value of Accumulated Depreciation: 132103.78 (2024-02-01)\n\nStep 5: This represents an expense accumulated (depreciation expense) over the period, directly related to the profit or loss statement.\n\nHence:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '132103.78'}}\n```",
