So we treat opening balance as zero unless specified otherwise.\n\n- But we see purchases dated \"2023-12-31\" with \"Unpaid\" status that represent accounts payable amounts.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Find the total accounts payable at the ending date**\n\n- \"Unpaid\" purchases represent amounts owed, so total accounts payable balance at end is the sum of all unpaid purchase amounts.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Sum all purchase entries with Unpaid status**\n\nLooking through the data for purchase entries (type = Purchase) with payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\":\n\n- Purchase20231231001 | Unpaid | 809,280.0\n\n- Purchase20231231002 | Unpaid | 19,650.0\n\n- Purchase20231231005 | Unpaid | 44,850.0\n\n- Purchase20231231006 | Unpaid | 605,000.0\n\n- Purchase20231231007 | Unpaid | 75,250.0\n\n- Purchase20231231013 | Unpaid | 596,000.0\n\n- Purchase20231231015 | Unpaid | 1,470,000.0\n\n- Purchase20231231016 | Unpaid | 700,000.0\n\n- Purchase20231231017 | Unpaid | 218,240.0\n\n- Purchase20231231018 | Unpaid | 399,000.0\n\n- Purchase20231231020 | Unpaid | 558,000.0\n\n- Purchase20231231012 | Unpaid | 100,800.0\n\nSum these unpaid purchase amounts:\n\n809,280.0\n\n+ 19,650.0\n\n+ 44,850.0\n\n+ 605,000.0\n\n+ 75,250.0\n\n+ 596,000.0\n\n+ 1,470,000.0\n\n+ 700,000.0\n\n+ 218,240.0\n\n+ 399,000.0\n\n+ 558,000.0\n\n+ 100,800.0\n\nCalculate sum stepwise:\n\n- 809,280 + 19,650 = 828,930\n\n- 828,930 + 44,850 = 873,780\n\n- 873,780 + 605,000 = 1,478,780\n\n- 1,478,780 + 75,250 = 1,554,030\n\n- 1,554,030 + 596,000 = 2,150,030\n\n- 2,150,030 + 1,470,000 = 3,620,030\n\n- 3,620,030 + 700,000 = 4,320,030\n\n- 4,320,030 + 218,240 = 4,538,270\n\n- 4,538,270 + 399,000 = 4,937,270\n\n- 4,937,270 + 558,000 = 5,495,270\n\n- 5,495,270 + 100,800 = 5,596,070\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Sum all purchase entries with Paid status as payments reducing accounts payable**\n\nPaid purchases decrease accounts payable because the company settled them.\n\nPaid purchase amounts:\n\n- Purchase20231231003 | Paid | 19,050.0\n\n- Purchase20231231004 | Paid | 639,360.0\n\n- Purchase20231231008 | Paid | 460,800.0\n\n- Purchase20231231009 | Paid | 181,280.0\n\n- Purchase20231231010 | Paid | 448,000.0\n\n- Purchase20231231011 | Paid | 88,550.0\n\n- Purchase20231231014 | Paid | 396,000.0\n\n- Purchase20231231019 | Paid | 162,800.0\n\n- Purchase20231231021 (if any) â€” none listed.\n\nSum:\n\n19,050 + 639,360 + 460,800 + 181,280 + 448,000 + 88,550 + 396,000 + 162,800\n\nCalculate stepwise:\n\n- 19,050 + 639,360 = 658,410\n\n- 658,410 + 460,800 = 1,119,210\n\n- 1,119,210 + 181,280 = 1,300,490\n\n- 1,300,490 + 448,000 = 1,748,490\n\n- 1,748,490 + 88,550 = 1,837,040\n\n- 1,837,040 + 396,000 = 2,233,040\n\n- 2,233,040 + 162,800 = 2,395,840\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Compute the increase (decrease) in accounts payable**\n\nAs no opening accounts payable balance is given, we consider that unpaid purchases represent the ending accounts payable balance.\n\nHowever, these unpaid purchases are the total unpaid purchases that are still owed.\n\nBut the paid purchases are settled liabilities that reduce accounts payable.\n\nTo find the net increase in accounts payable during the period:\n\nAccounts Payable Increase = Sum of unpaid purchases - Sum of paid purchases\n\n= 5,596,070.0 - 2,395,840.0\n\n= 3,200,230.0\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Final result**\n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Accounts Payable = 3,200,230.00\n\nExpressed with two decimals.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"3200230.00\"}}\n```",
