In the data, expenses are separated as:\n\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Sales Expenses\n- Financial Expenses\n- Depreciation (usually included in expenses)\n- Other expense types if any (not applicable here except depreciation and interest receivables, but interest receivables is income or asset, not expense)\n\nIgnore:\n- Purchase amounts (these affect cost of goods sold, not expenses line item directly here)\n- Fixed Assets (capitalized costs)\n- Interest Receivables (are income or assets, not expenses)\n- Transfer or deposit entries (assets or cash movements)\n\nLet's identify and sum amounts under the following types denoting expenses:\n\n- \"Administrative Expenses\"\n- \"Sales Expenses\"\n- \"Financial Expenses\"\n- \"Depreciation\"\n\nStep-by-step:\n\n1.
