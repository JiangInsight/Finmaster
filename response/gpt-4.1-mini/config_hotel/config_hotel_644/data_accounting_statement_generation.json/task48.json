cash outflows\n\nBut initial cash is the starting cash, so the **net increase** is:\n\nNet Increase = cash inflows - cash outflows = 451,438.06 - 4,155,671.75 = -3,704,233.69\n\nThis means cash and equivalents decreased by 3,704,233.69.\n\n**Note:** The initial cash and bank deposit values are initial balances, not cash flows during the period; net increase is the net of inflows and outflows in the period.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"-3704233.69\"}}\n```\n\n# Explanation:\n\n- Only cash inflows and outflows matter for net increase in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n- Outflows include cash purchases, expenses paid in cash, and purchases of fixed assets paid by bank transfer (cash equivalents).\n\n- Inflows include cash paid sales only.\n\n- Transfers between cash and bank accounts don't affect total cash and cash equivalents, so excluded from net increase calculation.",
