Calculate all changes to the bank deposits over the period (inflows and outflows).\n3. Determine the final bank deposit amount after all transactions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Bank Deposit Amount\nFrom the initial balances:\n- Bank deposit initial amount = 5,000,000.00\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze transactions affecting bank deposits\n\n- Consider transactions affecting bank deposits.\n\nLook for:\n\n- Purchases paid by \"Bank Transfer\" → outflow (reduce bank deposits)\n- Fixed Assets purchased paid by \"Bank Transfer\" → outflow (reduce bank deposits)\n- Transfers labeled \"Cash to bank transfer\" → inflow to bank deposits (increase bank deposits)\n- Other transactions paid from bank deposits (payment_method = \"Bank Transfer\") → reduce bank deposits\n- Sales received by bank (not explicit, but sales are mostly \"Cash\" or \"Account Receviable\")\n- Note: Expenses paid are mostly by \"Cash\", so they do not affect bank deposit balances.\n  \n---\n\n### Step 3: Sum the changes\n\n#### Purchases paid by Bank Transfer (reduce bank deposit):\n|Amount|Payment method|\n|-|-|\n|19650.0 | Account Payable (unpaid) → no cash outflow yet|\n|19050.0 | Cash (not bank, so no bank impact)|\n|455144.64 | Fixed Asset Purchase | Bank Transfer\n|639360.0 | Cash (no bank impact)\n|44850.0 | Account Payable (unpaid) no cash outflow|\n|605000.0 | Account Payable (unpaid) no cash outflow|\n|88550.0 | Cash no bank impact|\n|181280.0 | Bank Transfer (purchase) → reduce bank deposit\n|448000.0 | Bank Transfer (purchase) → reduce bank deposit\n|374964.45 | Fixed Asset Purchase | Bank Transfer\n|1495645.8 | Fixed Asset Purchase | Bank Transfer\n|396000.0 | Bank Transfer (purchase) → reduce bank deposit\n|639360.0 | Cash no bank impact\n|460800.0 | Cash no bank impact\n|455144.64 | Bank Transfer Fixed asset already counted\n|625338.59 | Fixed Asset Purchase | Bank Transfer\n|464570.86 | Fixed Asset Purchase | Bank Transfer\n|218240.0 | Account Payable no cash outflow yet\n|399000.0 | Account Payable unpaid no cash outflow\n|74750.0 | unlisted in data\n|88550.0 | Cash no bank impact\n|1495645.8 | Bank Transfer Fixed asset purchase counted\n|181280.0 | Purchase Bank Transfer counted\n|448000.0 | Purchased Bank Transfer counted\n|396000.0 | Bank Transfer purchase counted\n| 'Purchase20231231011' | purchase 88550.0 Cash → no bank effect |\n\nWe summarize the bank transfer purchases and fixed assets that are paid on \"Bank Transfer\". \n\nLook for all transactions with payment_method == \"Bank Transfer\":\n\nFrom the data snippet:\n\n- Fixed Assets Purchase by Bank Transfer:\n  -
