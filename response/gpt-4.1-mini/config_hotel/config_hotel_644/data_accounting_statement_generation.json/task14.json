Sum their amounts.\n\nFrom the data (filter by Purchase and Unpaid):\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 809,280.0 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231002: 19,650.0 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231005: 44,850.0 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231006: 605,000.0 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231007: 75,250.0 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231012: 100,800.0 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231015: 1,470,000.0 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231016: 700,000.0 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231017: 218,240.0 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231018: 399,000.0 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231020: 558,000.0 (Unpaid)\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Sum unpaid purchases amounts\n\nSum = 809,280 + 19,650 + 44,850 + 605,000 + 75,250 + 100,800 + 1,470,000 + 700,000 + 218,240 + 399,000 + 558,000\n\nCalculating:\n\n- 809,280 + 19,650 = 828,930\n- 828,930 + 44,850 = 873,780\n- 873,780 + 605,000 = 1,478,780\n- 1,478,780 + 75,250 = 1,554,030\n- 1,554,030 + 100,800 = 1,654,830\n- 1,654,830 + 1,470,000 = 3,124,830\n- 3,124,830 + 700,000 = 3,824,830\n- 3,824,830 + 218,240 = 4,043,070\n- 4,043,070 + 399,000 = 4,442,070\n- 4,442,070 + 558,000 = 5,000,070\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Check if any other current liabilities appear\n\nNo clear indication of other current liabilities such as short-term loans, accrued expenses.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Verify possible payments that decrease liabilities\n\nSome purchases are \"Paid\", which will reduce liabilities, but since those are not unpaid, they do not increase current liabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Final current liabilities\n\nSince initial value is presumably 0 (no initial current liabilities given explicitly), final value is the total unpaid purchases amount.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Total Current Liabilities Initial Value: 0.00\n- Total Current Liabilities End Value: 5,000,070.00\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"5000070.00\"}}\n```",
