Identify the initial inventory value at the start date (given by Initial entries of inventory items).\n2. Sum all inventory purchases during the period.\n3. Sum all inventory sales (cost amounts or cost of inventory sold) during the period.\n4. Compute the net change in inventory:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{(Increase) Decrease in Inventory} = \\text{Initial Inventory} + \\text{Purchases} - \\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}\n   \\]  \n   The value reflects the amount invested in inventory (purchase minus what has been sold) and the increase or decrease in inventory.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify initial inventory value\n\nFrom the data, \"Initial\" entries with inventory products are usually those with product_id/product_name and quantities.\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- The only initial entry for inventory-related line is:\n\n  - Initial20231231001 with type \"Initial\" for Fixed Assets 8000000.0 (this is a fixed asset, not inventory, so exclude)\n\n- Other \"Initial\" entries are for Cash, Bank, Fixed Assets only, no direct inventory initial balances are given explicitly.\n\nSo initial inventory is implicitly zero or not given separately.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Sum up all purchases (inventory acquisitions)\n\nPurchases are entries where type is \"Purchase\" with product_id and product_name referring to inventory items, with quantity and cost_per_unit.\n\nCalculate total purchase cost = sum of all purchase \"amount\" for inventory products.\n\nLook for entries with:\n\n- type = \"Purchase\"\n- product_id and product_name present (inventory items)\n- amount field is cost of purchase = cost_per_unit Ã— quantity (given for verification)\n\nWe add these amounts.\n\nLet's list all purchase lines and their amounts for inventory products:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: Banquet Set, amount=809280.0  \n- Purchase20231231002: Quick Meal Set, amount=19650.0  \n- Purchase20231231003: Quick Meal Set, amount=19050.0  \n- Purchase20231231004: Banquet Set, amount=639360.0  \n- Purchase20231231005: Quick Meal Set, amount=44850.0  \n- Purchase20231231006: Luxury Suite, amount=605000.0  \n- Purchase20231231007: Business Meal Set, amount=75250.0  \n- Purchase20231231008: Banquet Set, amount=460800.0  \n- Purchase20231231009: Deluxe Meal Set, amount=181280.0  \n- Purchase20231231010: Business Room, amount=448000.0  \n- Purchase20231231011: Business Meal Set, amount=88550.0  \n- Purchase20231231012: Business Meal Set, amount=100800.0  \n- Purchase20231231013: Business Room, amount=596000.0  \n- Purchase20231231014: Standard Room, amount=396000.0  \n- Purchase20231231015: Luxury Suite, amount=1470000.0  \n- Purchase20231231016: Luxury Suite, amount=700000.0  \n- Purchase20231231017: Deluxe Meal Set, amount=218240.0  \n- Purchase20231231018: Standard Room, amount=399000.0  \n- Purchase20231231019: Deluxe Meal Set, amount=162800.0  \n- Purchase20231231020: Business Room, amount=558000.0  \n\nSum those purchase amounts:  \n809280 + 19650 + 19050 + 639360 + 44850 + 605000 + 75250 + 460800 + 181280 + 448000 + 88550 + 100800 + 596000 + 396000 + 1470000 + 700000 + 218240 + 399000 + 162800 + 558000\n\nCalculations:\n\n- 809280  \n- +19650 = 828930  \n- +19050 = 847980  \n- +639360 = 1,487,340  \n- +44850 = 1,532,190  \n- +605000 = 2,137,190  \n- +75,250 = 2,212,440  \n- +460,800 = 2,673,240  \n- +181,280 = 2,854,520  \n- +448,000 = 3,302,520  \n- +88,550 = 3,391,070  \n- +100,800 = 3,491,870  \n- +596,000 = 4,087,870  \n- +396,000 = 4,483,870  \n- +1,470,000 = 5,953,870 (This seems off: should be 1,470,000 or 1,470,0000? Actually in data, 1,470,000 (Purchase20231231015), correct.) So 4,483,870 + 1,470,000 = 5,953,870  \n- +700,000 = 6,653,870  \n- +218,240 = 6,872,110  \n- +399,000 = 7,271,110  \n- +162,800 = 7,433,910  \n- +558,000 = 7,991,910  \n\nSo total purchases = 7,991,910.00\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\n\nCOGS = Sum of cost_amount from all sale transactions for inventory items.\n\nLook for entries with type \"Sale\", with product_id/product_name inventory, and cost_amount indicating cost of inventory sold.\n\nSum the cost_amount fields for all those sales.\n\nLet's list sale lines with their cost_amount:\n\nFrom data
