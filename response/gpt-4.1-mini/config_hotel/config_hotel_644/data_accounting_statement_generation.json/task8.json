Identify any initial accumulated depreciation value â€” typically this is the recorded amount at the start of the period.\n2. Sum depreciation entries (type contains \"Depreciation\") during the period to find the total accumulated depreciation added.\n3. Determine the final accumulated depreciation value by adding the total depreciation expense to the initial accumulated depreciation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial accumulated depreciation\n\n- Look for any initial accumulated depreciation value at the start (typically at date 2023-12-31 or earlier).\n- The problem data includes an **Initial fixed assets amount of 8,000,000**, but no explicit initial accumulated depreciation entry visible.\n- There is **no entry of type 'Accumulated Depreciation' or similar on date 2023-12-31** or the initial setup, so we assume:\n\n**Initial Accumulated Depreciation = 0.00**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Sum depreciation expenses during the period\n\n- There are two depreciation entries recorded in the transactions:\n\n  - On 2024-01-01: Amount = 45751.5  \n  - On 2024-02-01: Amount = 86352.28\n\n- Sum these depreciation amounts:  \n  45751.5 + 86352.28 = 132,103.78\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Final accumulated depreciation\n\n- Initial (0) + total depreciation during period (132,103.78) = 132,103.78  \n- So final accumulated depreciation is 132,103.78\n\n---\n\n### Final answer output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"132103.78\"}}\n```",
