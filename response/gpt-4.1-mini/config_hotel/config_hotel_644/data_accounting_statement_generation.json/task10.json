                        "content": "To calculate the property, plant and non-current assets (Fixed Assets) item in the balance sheet, including the initial and final amounts, we proceed as follows:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify Initial Value of Fixed Assets\n\nFrom the problem data:\n\n- Initial Fixed Assets entry at 2023-12-31:\n  - Type: \"Fixed Assets\"\n  - Amount = 8,000,000.00\n\nSo the **initial fixed assets value** = 8,000,000.00\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate additions to Fixed Assets after initial date (purchases)\n\nLook for all **Fixed Assets Purchases** entries (type starting with \"FixedAsset\" or asset_type related to fixed assets) with recorded_date > 2023-12-31 and sum their amounts:\n\nFrom the data, multiple entries labeled \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" at \"2023-12-31\" (which is initial date â€“ already included in initial), but also some very important fixed assets purchases on or just after initial date to add:\n\n- FixedAsset20231231001 (date 2023-12-31) amounts and asset_names - counted in initial because date same as initial.\n- Any other \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" with date after initial date. In this data, no later dates beyond 2023-12-31 are provided for Fixed Assets Purchase explicitly with other date than 2023-12-31.\n\nFrom given records:\n\nFixed Assets Purchase lines at 2023-12-31:\n\n- 455,144.64 (Elevator System4)\n- 374,964.45 (Kitchen Equipment5)\n- 1,495,645.80 (Renovation Project6)\n- 625,338.59 (Elevator System7)\n- 464,570.86 (Kitchen Equipment8)\n\nAll these dates are 2023-12-31, same as initial date, so we treat these as part of initial value?\n\nHowever, initial fixed assets given is 8,000,000.0, likely already includes these additions since initial entry date is 2023-12-31.\n\nHence, these purchases are included in initial value.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Consider Fixed Asset Purchases post-initial date\n\nNo fixed asset purchase entries after 2023-12-31 are shown.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Depreciation during period (reduce asset value)\n\nDepreciation entries (type \"Depreciation\") reduce fixed assets value:\n\n- Depreciation on 2024-01-01: 45,751.5\n- Depreciation on 2024-02-01: 86,352.28\n\nSum depreciation total = 45,751.5 + 86,352.28 = 132,103.78\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Fixed Assets closing value:\n\nFixed Assets End Value = Initial Fixed Assets + additions - depreciation\n\nAdditions = 0 (no new fixed assets purchases after 2023-12-31)\n\nDepreciation = 132,103.78\n\nThus,\n\nFixed Assets End Value = 8,000,000.00 - 132,103.78 = 7,867,896.22\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"7867896.22\"}}\n```",
