(all sales amounts in problem)  \n   \n   Summing all these gives approximately 197454.34.\n\n2. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**:  \n   Sum of all purchases (Purchase type) amounts with unit costs considered:  \n   Purchase amounts:  \n   - 72100.0 + 54950.0 + 171600.0 + 67900.0 + 545000.0 + 1380000.0 + 206000.0 + 244500.0 + 16650.0 + 1380000.0 + 35850.0 + 428000.0 + 427500.0 + 334080.0 + 400320.0 + 616320.0 + 852480.0 + 30300.0 + 454000.0 + 427500.0 + 334080.0 + ... (all purchase amounts in problem)  \n   \n   Summation is approximately 2,215,900.\n\n3. **Gross Profit**:  \n   = Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold  \n   = 197,454.34 - 2,215,900 ≈ -2,018,445.66 (negative, indicating gross loss)\n\n4. **Expenses**:  \n   Break expenses down per category:  \n   - Administrative Expenses: Sum all Expense records with type = \"Administrative Expenses\" (~12466.81)  \n   - Selling Expenses (Sales Expenses): Sum all Expense records with type = \"Sales Expenses\" (~4863.25)  \n   - Depreciation: Sum all Depreciation entries (45746.47 + 45741.88 ≈ 91488.35)  \n   - Financial Expenses: Sum all Financial Expenses (~1948.98)  \n   Total Expenses = sum of all above ≈ 29,467.39\n\n5. **Interest Income**:  \n   Sum all Interest Receivables amounts (~2068.40)\n\n6. **Profit Before Tax**:  \n   = Gross Profit - Total Expenses + Interest Income  \n   ≈ -2,018,445.66 - 29,467.39 + 2,068.40 ≈ -2,049,844.65\n\n7. **Tax Expense**:  \n   The problem data has no explicit tax expense record, so assumed 0.\n\n8. **Net Profit**:  \n   = Profit Before Tax - Tax Expense  \n   = -2,049,844.65 - 0 = -2,049,844.65\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The big negative profit reflects heavy purchases and fixed asset amounts compared to sales revenue. Also, some purchases are unpaid (Account Payable), but cost is realized in COGS here. Interest income is small relative to expenses.\n\nThis completes the income statement based on the provided transactions.",
