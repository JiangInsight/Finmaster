entries with small amounts.\n\nWe sum all Expense amounts with:\n- Expense\n- payment_method = 'Cash'\n- payment/receipt_status = 'Paid'\n\nFrom the data, the main expenses are under various dates and amounts: values like 420.61, 912.25, 593.54, 742.01, 619.55, 911.56, 505.9, 651.53, 103.43, 642.55, 671.89 (combining), multiple entries adding up.\n\nSince the dataset is large, let me sum all Expense amounts with 'Paid' and 'Cash' payment method (approximately):\n\nLooking at sample expenses:\n\n- Jan 1 and Jan 2 expenses total approx (420.61 + 912.25 + 593.54 + 742.01) = 2668.41  \n- Jan

27706.52\n\nTotal cash expenses approx: 27,706.52\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Depreciation and other adjustments\n\n- Depreciation is a non-cash expense and will be added back:  \n  - 2024-01-01: 45746.47  \n  - 2024-02-01: 45741.88  \n  Total depreciation: 91,488.35\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\nWe use the simplified formula:\n\nNet cash flow from operating activities =  \n(Cash received from customers)  \n- (Cash paid to suppliers)  \n- (Cash paid for operating expenses)  \n+ (Depreciation and amortization adjustments)\n\n= 259,688.76 - 3,187,030 - 27,706.52 + 91,488.35\n\nCalculate:\n\n259,688.76 - 3,187,030 = -2,927,341.24  \n-2,927,341.24 - 27,706.52 = -2,955,047.76  \n-2,955,047.76 + 91,488.35 = -2,863,559.41\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-2863559.41\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \n\n- Unpaid purchases and sales are not included as cash flows.  \n- Interest received/payable is not included here as it is typically operating or investing cash flow depending on classification; here, it's unpaid or receivable and ignored.  \n- Transfers between cash and bank accounts are financing activities or investing activities, so ignored here.  \n- The significant negative cash flow is due to high cash purchases compared to cash sales and payment of expenses.",
