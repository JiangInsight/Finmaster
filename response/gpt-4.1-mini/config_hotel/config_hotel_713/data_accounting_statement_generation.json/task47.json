Start with the initial cash and bank deposit amounts (cash and bank are cash equivalents).\n2. Add any cash inflows (receipts) marked as \"Paid\" and using \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" as payment_method.\n3. Subtract any cash outflows (payments) marked as \"Paid\" and paid by \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\".\n4. Transfers between cash and bank accounts do not affect the combined balance (just move money internally).\n5. Ignore unpaid transactions since they have not affected cash yet.\n6. Ignore depreciation (non-cash) and interest receivables (unpaid interest income).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Balances\n\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n\n**Initial cash and equivalents total = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000.0**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Cash/Banks Inflows (from \"Sale\" or others) and Outflows (from \"Expense\" or \"Purchase\")\n\nWe consider only transactions affecting cash or bank:\n\n- For inflows: Payment/receipt status = \"Paid\" and payment_method = \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" or similar.\n\n- For outflows: Payment/receipt status = \"Paid\" and payment_method = \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\".\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Sum Cash inflows (Cash receipts from sales and others)\n\nSales Paid with Cash (payment_method = Cash):\n\nFrom the

62137.46+224239.55=286377.01  \nTotal all expenses = 974547.6 + 286377.01 = 1,260,924.61\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Handle Transfers Between Cash and Bank\n\nTransfers move cash from one to the other, no net effect on combined cash/equivalents.\n\nFrom the data, multiple \"Transfer\" entries with \"Cash to bank transfer\" and amount 100,000, etc. So ignore for ending balance.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation\n\n**Initial cash and equivalents:** 8,000,000.00  \n**Add cash inflows (Sales Paid in Cash):** +221,254.82  \n**Subtract cash outflows (Purchases paid + Expenses paid in cash):** - (3,187,030.00 + 1,260,924.61) = -4,447,954.61  \n\n**Ending cash and cash equivalents = 8,000,000 + 221,254.82 - 4,447,954.61 =**\n\nCalculate:\n\n8,000,000 + 221,254.82 = 8,221,254.82  \n8,221,254.82 - 4,447,954.61 = 3,773,300.21\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Verify no missed cash inflows/outflows\n\n- Ignore unpaid purchases/expenses.\n\n- Ignore unpaid sales (no cash inflows yet).\n\n- Ignore depreciation and interest receivables (non-cash).\n\n- Bank deposits and payments are included as bank transfer payment method.\n\n- Confirmed cash and bank transfer payments are included.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer\n\nThe final ending cash and cash equivalents balance is **3,773,300.21**\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"3773300.21\"}}\n```\n",
