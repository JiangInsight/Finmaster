Identify the initial accumulated depreciation value.\n2. Find the total depreciation amounts recorded during the period.\n3. Calculate the final accumulated depreciation by adding the depreciation expenses to the initial accumulated depreciation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial accumulated depreciation\n\n- The initial accumulated depreciation value is not explicitly stated in the initial records.\n- Usually, at the initial balance sheet date (2023-12-31), the accumulated depreciation is recorded as zero unless specified otherwise.\n- In the provided data, there is no explicit \"Accumulated Depreciation\" initial line or amount before 2024-01-01, so initial value is **0.00**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Depreciation amounts during the period\n\n- Look for all entries with the type or description indicating depreciation.\n- Found:\n  - 2024-01-01 | Depreciation | 45746.47\n  - 2024-02-01 | Depreciation | 45741.88\n\n- Total depreciation for the period is cumulative; the balance sheet at the end should reflect the accumulated amount including these.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Final accumulated depreciation\n\n- Assume depreciation is cumulative and that the second depreciation entry (45741.88) is the latest total accumulated amount as of 2024-02-01.\n- Since no other depreciation transactions or accumulated depreciation initial value are indicated, the end accumulated depreciation is the latest depreciation recorded: **45741.88**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accumulated Depreciation End Value': '45741.88'}}\n```",
