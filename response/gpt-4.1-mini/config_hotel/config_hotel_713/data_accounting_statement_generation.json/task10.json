                        "content": "To calculate the property, plant and non-current assets item in the balance sheet, including both the initial and final amounts, we need to:\n\n1. Identify the initial fixed assets amount at the beginning.\n2. Add purchases related to non-current assets during the period.\n3. Subtract depreciation expenses during the period.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Non-current Assets\n\nFrom the problem data:\n\n- Initial Fixed Assets on 2023-12-31: 8,000,000.0\n\nSo:\n**Initial Non-current Assets = 8,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Add Purchases of Fixed Assets\n\nLook for purchases related to non-current assets (usually large amounts related to property, plant, equipment, buildings, or assets labeled as such).\n\nChecking the \"Purchase\" entries with large amounts and product names or codes related to assets:\n\n- Purchase20231231005: 545,000.0 for product_id R003 (Luxury Suite, likely non-current asset)\n- Purchase20231231006: 1,380,000.0 for product_id R003 (Luxury Suite) — paid/unpaid status is Unpaid\n- Purchase20231231010: 1,380,000.0 for product_id R003 (Luxury Suite) — paid\n- Purchase20231231007: 206,000.0 for purchase of R002 (Business Room)\n- Purchase20231231008: 244,500.0 for R001 (Standard Room)\n- Purchase20231231012: 427,500.0 for R001 (Standard Room)\n- Purchase20231231017: 428,000.0 for R002 (Business Room)\n- Purchase20231231013: 454,000.0 for R002 (Business Room)\n- Purchase20231231022: 852,480.0 for F004 (Banquet Set) — unlikely non-current asset; F means probably furniture but not confirmed.\n- Purchase20231231020: 616,320.0 for F004 - Banquet Set - same as above, might be furniture but generally furniture is a non-current asset.\n- Purchase20231231019: 400,320.0 for F004 (Banquet Set).\n\nThe problem does not explicitly say F004 is non-current asset or not. Usually banquet sets and furniture would be non-current assets.\n\nGiven the typical accounting, fixed assets include property, plant and equipment, furniture, fixtures, and equipment.\n\nThus, likely F004 (Banquet Set) is part of non-current assets.\n\nSo, for purchases related to non-current assets, sum:\n\n- R003 Luxury Suite:  \n  - 545,000.0 (paid)  \n  - 1,380,000.0 (unpaid)  \n  - 1,380,000.0 (paid)  \n- R002 Business Room:  \n  - 206,000.0 (paid)  \n  - 428,000.0 (unpaid)  \n  - 454,000.0 (unpaid)  \n- R001 Standard Room:  \n  - 244,500.0 (unpaid)  \n  - 427,500.0 (paid)  \n- F004 Banquet Set:  \n  - 852,480.0 (unpaid)  \n  - 616,320.0 (unpaid)  \n  - 400,320.0 (unpaid)  \n\nSum these amounts (regardless of paid/unpaid for asset value calculation):\n\nAdd R003 values:\n545,000 + 1,380,000 + 1,380,000 = 3,305,000.0  \nAdd R002 values:  \n206,000 + 428,000 + 454,000 = 1,088,000.0  \nAdd R001 values:  \n244,500 + 427,500 = 672,000.0  \nAdd F004 values:  \n852,480 + 616,320 + 400,320 = 1,869,120.0  \n\nTotal purchases (add all above):  \n3,305,000 + 1,088,000 + 672,000 + 1,869,120 = 6,934,120.0  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Subtract Depreciation\n\nCheck depreciation amounts during the period:\n\n- Depreciation20240101001: 45,746.47  \n- Depreciation20240201002: 45,741.88\n\nSum depreciation: 45,746.47 + 45,741.88 = 91,488.35\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculate final non-current assets:\n\nInitial + purchases - depreciation = Final non-current assets\n\n8,000,000 + 6,934,120 - 91,488.35 = 14,842,631.65\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"14842631.65\"}}\n```",
