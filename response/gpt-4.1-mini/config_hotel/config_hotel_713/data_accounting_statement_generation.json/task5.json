Here last transaction date is 2024-02-05 for interest receivables.\n\nWe should sum all Interest Receivable amounts with payment/receipt_status as \"Unpaid\" over the entire data set.\n\nSumming all interest receivables amounts (unpaid):  \nFrom the data extract: interest receivable entries have amounts mostly approx 262.74135, counted many times.\n\nCounting how many interest receivable entries (unpaid):\n\nFrom the data extract, counting interest receivable entries (and their amounts):\n\n- 2024-01-01: 440.10945  \n- 2024-01-02: 385.56135  \n- 2024-01-03: 385.56135  \n- 2024-01-04: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-05: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-06: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-07: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-08: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-09: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-10: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-11: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-12: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-13: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-14: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-15: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-16: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-17: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-18: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-19: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-20: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-21: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-22: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-23: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-24: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-25: 262.74135  \n- 2024-01-26: 262.74135  \n- 2024-02-01: 262.74135  \n- 2024-02-02: 262.74135  \n- 2024-02-03: 262.74135  \n- 2024-02-04: 262.74135  \n- 2024-02-05: 262.74135  \n\nCounting unique days:  \n- From 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-26: 26 days  \n- Plus 2024-02-01 to 2024-02-05: 5 days\n\nTotal 31 days of entries with unpaid interest receivable values.\n\nSum:\n\n- Jan 1: 440.10945  \n- Jan 2-3: 2 * 385.56135 = 771.1227  \n- Jan 4-26: 23 * 262.74135 = 6043.05205  \n- Feb 1-5: 5 * 262.74135 = 1313.70675\n\nTotal sum:  \n= 440.10945 + 771.1227 + 6043.05205 + 1313.70675  \n= approx 8567.99\n\nThis seems high based on the problem example result. But in the example, interest receivable amounts were smaller.\n\nGiven that, and since the problem instructions and examples show the answer is simply the summation of all interest receivable amounts in \"Unpaid\" status, and initial is zero (no initial record).\n\nTherefore final Interest Receivable = sum of all Interest Receivables amounts with \"Unpaid\" up to the final data date.\n\nWe sum (to two decimals):\n\nSum amounts column filtered by type = 'Interest Receivables'\n\nAmounts are (from problem data extract):\n\n- 440.11  \n- 385.56  \n- 385.56  \n- 262.74 * 26 times approx  \nNote: Also in the problem data some interest receivable amounts are negative or lower values (some minor variations like -54.77, 16.43, 5.75, etc.). But in this specific problem dataset, those are not visible or minimal.\n\nWait, in the given problem data, the interest receivables amounts are mostly 262.74135 and 385.56135, 440.10945.\n\nSo total Interest Receivable End Value = sum of all these interest receivable unpaid amounts.\n\nHence:\n\nCalculating precisely sum all \"amount\" where type == \"Interest Receivables\":\n\nFrom the problem statement, given the length of data, the value is approximately:\n\n- Initial value: 0.00  \n- Final value: sum of all interest receivable amounts with \"Unpaid\" status is approximately 8567.99 (based on per day counts).\n\n---\n\n**Final answer**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"8567.99\"}}\n```\n\n# Explanation:  \nSince no initial Interest Receivable is given, it's zero. The end value is the sum of all Interest Receivable entries with \"Unpaid\" status in the data.",
