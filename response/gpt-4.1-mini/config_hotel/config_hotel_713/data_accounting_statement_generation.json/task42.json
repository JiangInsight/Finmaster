presumably purchase tax = cost_per_unit × quantity × tax rate?\n\nNo tax_amount columns for purchases are shown.\n\nAssuming tax_amount is not listed directly for purchases, and problem example does not give tax amount for purchases.\n\nSo likely the tax payable change is from sales tax amount - purchase tax amount (input tax on purchases).\n\n----\n\n#### Sales and their tax amounts:\n\nFrom the sales entries, tax_amount field is given:\n\nSum all tax_amount in sales (both paid and unpaid):\n\nWe will calculate total output tax:\n\nFrom sales (tax_amount):\n\n- 69.87  \n- 120.4  \n- 346.14  \n- 762.49  \n- 284.27  \n- 313.53  \n- 413.09  \n- 66.69  \n- 23.17  \n- 285.66  \n- 85.87  \n- 226.99  \n- 229.96  \n- 110.35  \n- 133.88  \n- 11.03  \n- 440.98  \n- 52.98  \n- 26.82  \n- 1201.77  \n- 390.67  \n- 184.18  \n- 52.92  \n- 297.6  \n- 152.99  \n- 325.15  \n- 85.87 (already above counted)  \n- 38.43  \n- 348.67  \n- 384.56  \n- 47.16  \n- 217.96  \n- 439.14  \n- 142.41  \n- 703.09  \n- 129.66  \n- 197.92  \n- 62.23  \n- 196.43  \n- 127.12  \n- 49.88  \n- 310.37  \n- 53.31  \n- 213.25  \n- 341.56  \n- 1640.34  \n- 307.67  \n- 429.48  \n- 315.17  \n- 289.61  \n- 59.45  \n- 532.18  \n- 184.67  \n- 23.17  \n- 451.03  \n- 149.86  \n- 262.74 (interest receivable, ignore, these are not tax)  \n- 237.87  \n- 654.35  \n- 52.92  \n- 1317.26  \n- 292.52  \n- 316.78  \n- 99.37  \n- 304.1  \n- 222.98  \n- 53.31  \n- 213.25  \n- 262.74 (interest receivables, ignore)  \n- 262.74 (interest)  \n- 1640.34\n\nWe should only sum the tax amount related to sales, excluding interest receivables.\n\nSo we only sum tax_amount column on sales entries only.\n\nSumming them:\n\nWe'll sum just the known sales tax_amounts (exclude interest entries):\n\nCalculating sum of tax_amount for sales only:\n\nUsing the sales with tax_amount fields:\n\n- 69.87\n- 120.4\n- 346.14\n- 762.49\n- 284.27\n- 313.53\n- 413.09\n- 66.69\n- 23.17\n- 285.66\n- 85.87\n- 226.99\n- 229.96\n- 110.35\n- 133.88\n- 11.03\n- 440.98\n- 52.98\n- 26.82\n- 1201.77\n- 390.67\n- 184.18\n- 52.92\n- 297.6\n- 152.99\n-325.15\n- 38.43\n- 348.67\n- 384.56\n- 47.16\n- 217.96\n- 439.14\n- 142.41\n- 703.09\n- 129.66\n-197.92\n- 62.23\n- 196.43\n- 127.12\n- 49.88\n- 310.37\n- 53.31\n- 213.25\n- 1640.34\n- 307.67\n- 429.48\n- 315.17\n- 289.61\n- 59.45\n- 532.18\n- 178.47\n- 23.17\n- 451.03\n- 149.86\n- 237.87\n- 654.35\n- 1317.26\n- 292.52\n- 316.78\n- 99.37\n- 304.1\n- 222.98\n\nSumming these values:\n\nAdd them stepwise:\n\n(69.87 + 120.4) = 190.27  \n190.27 + 346.14 = 536.41  \n536.41 + 762.49 = 1298.9  \n1298.9 + 284.27 = 1583.17  \n1583.17 + 313.53 = 1896.7  \n1896.7 + 413.09 = 2309.79  \n2309.79 + 66.69 = 2376.48  \n2376.48 + 23.17 = 2399.65  \n2399.65 + 285.66 = 2685.31  \n2685.31 + 85.87 = 2771.18  \n2771.18 + 226.99 = 2998.17  \n2998.17 + 229.96 = 3228.13  \n3228.13 + 110.35 = 3338.48  \n3338.48 + 133.88 = 3472.36  \n3472.36 + 11.03 = 3483.39  \n3483.39 + 440.98 = 3924.37  \n3924.37 + 52.98 = 3977.35  \n3977.35 + 26.82 = 4004.17  \n4004.17 + 1201.77 = 5205.94  \n5205.94 + 390.67 = 5596.61  \n5596.61 + 184.18 = 5780.79  \n5780.79 + 52.92 = 5833.71  \n5833.71 + 297.6 = 6131.31  \n6131.31 + 152.99 = 6284.3  \n6284.3 + 325.15 = 6609.45  \n6609.45 + 38.43 = 6647.88  \n6647.88 + 348.67 = 6996.55  \n6996.55 + 384.56 = 7381.11  \n7381.11 + 47.16 = 7428.27  \n7428.27 + 217.96 = 7646.23  \n7646.23 + 439.14 = 8085.37  \n8085.37 + 142.41 = 8227.78  \n8227.78 + 703.09 = 8930.87  \n8930.87 + 129.66 = 9060.53  \n9060.53 + 197.92 = 9258.45  \n9258.45 + 62.23 = 9320.68  \n9320.68 + 196.43 = 9517.11  \n9517.11 + 127.12 = 9644.23  \n9644.23 + 49.88 = 9694.11  \n9694.11 + 310.37 = 10004.48  \n10004.48 + 53.31 = 10057.79  \n10057.79 + 213.25 = 10271.04  \n10271.04 + 1640.34 = 11911.38  \n11911.38 + 307.67 = 12219.05  \n12219.05 + 429.48 = 12648.53  \n12648.53 + 315.17 = 12963.7  \n12963.7 + 289.61 = 13253.31  \n13253.31 + 59.45 = 13312.76  \n13312.76 + 532.18 = 13844.94  \n13844.94 + 178.47 = 14023.41  \n14023.41 + 23.17 = 14046.58  \n14046.58 + 451.03 = 14497.61  \n14497.61 + 149.86 = 14647.47  \n14647.47 + 237.87 = 14885.34  \n14885.34 + 654.35 = 15539.69  \n15539.69 + 1317.26 = 16856.95  \n16856.95 + 292.52 = 17149.47  \n17149.47 + 316.78 = 17466.25  \n17466.25 + 99.37 = 17565.62  \n17565.62 + 304.1 = 17869.72  \n17869.72 + 222.98 = 18092.7  \n\n**Total Output Tax (Sales Tax) ≈ 18092.7**\n\n---\n\n#### Input Tax from Purchases:\n\nFor purchases, tax amount is not directly given, but cost_per_unit is same as tax rate in this data.
