                        "content": "To calculate the Accounts Payable item in the balance sheet, we need to:\n\n1. Identify the **initial Accounts Payable** amount from the initial dataâ€”transactions that are \"Initial\" and represent Accounts Payable or related entries as of the start date.\n2. Calculate the **increase in Accounts Payable** from new purchases recorded as **Unpaid** during the period.\n3. Deduct any payments made for previously unpaid purchases to get the **final Accounts Payable balance**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Accounts Payable Amount\n\nCheck if there are initial balances marked as Accounts Payable.\n\n- The initial entries given are:\n  - Cash deposit: 3,000,000 (not Accounts Payable)\n  - Bank deposit: 5,000,000 (not Accounts Payable)\n  - Fixed Assets: 8,000,000 (not Accounts Payable)\n  \nNo initial Accounts Payable amount explicitly given, so starting Accounts Payable is **0.00**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Sum of Unpaid Purchases (Accounts Payable) during the period\n\nLook for purchase entries with:\n- `payment/receipt_status` = 'Unpaid'\n- `payment_method` = 'Account Payable'\n  \nFrom the problem data, purchases with unpaid status and Account Payable as payment method are:\n\n| id              | amount    | payment_method   |\n|-----------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | 72,100    | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231006 | 1,380,000 | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231008 | 244,500   | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231009 | 16,650    | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231011 | 35,850    | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231014 | 208,560   | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231015 | 121,440   | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231016 | 154,500   | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231019 | 400,320   | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231022 | 852,480   | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231013 | 454,000   | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231018 | 30,300    | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231017 | 428,000   | Account Payable  |\n\nNow sum these unpaid \"Account Payable\" purchases:\n\nSum = 72,100 + 1,380,000 + 244,500 + 16,650 + 35,850 + 208,560 + 121,440 + 154,500 + 400,320 + 852,480 + 454,000 + 30,300 + 428,000\n\nLet's compute:\n\n- 72,100\n- + 1,380,000 = 1,452,100\n- + 244,500 = 1,696,600\n- + 16,650 = 1,713,250\n- + 35,850 = 1,749,100\n- + 208,560 = 1,957,660\n- + 121,440 = 2,079,100\n- + 154,500 = 2,233,600\n- + 400,320 = 2,633,920\n- + 852,480 = 3,486,400\n- + 454,000= 3,940,400\n- + 30,300 =3,970,700\n- + 428,000= 4,398,700\n\nSo, total unpaid purchases (Account Payable) = **4,398,700**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Sum of Paid purchases with Account Payable (if any)\n\nNot needed to subtract because paid purchases are paid off, so they don't count as payables.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Accounts Payable Balance\n\nSince initial is 0, all unpaid purchases sum directly to final Accounts Payable.\n\n**Accounts Payable Initial Value:** 0.00  \n**Accounts Payable End Value:** 4,398,700.00\n\n---\n\n### Final answer format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"4398700.00\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\n- No initial accounts payable.\n- Sum all unpaid purchases with \"Account Payable\" payment method.\n- No deductions necessary for payments since we're only considering outstanding unpaid Bills.\n- Result is the sum of unpaid purchase amounts with Account Payable as payment method.\n\n---\n\n# Final output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"4398700.00\"}}\n```",
