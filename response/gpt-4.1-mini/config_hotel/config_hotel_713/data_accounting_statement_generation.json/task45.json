Initial fixed asset balance:\n   - Initial fixed assets = 8,000,000 (no cash flow here, it's a starting balance)\n   \n2. Look for transactions related to Fixed Assets or purchases of long-term assets:\n   - No explicit Fixed Asset sale transactions shown (no sales or disposals of fixed assets).\n\n3. Look for purchase of fixed assets or other investing cash outflows (capital expenditures):\n   - No transactions directly named as Fixed Asset Purchase or similar except the initial fixed assets.\n   \n4. Purchase transactions mostly relate to supplies, meals, rooms, products etc., which are operating activities or inventory purchases, not investing activities.\n\n5. Depreciation and Interest Receivable, expenses are operating activities, so ignore.\n\n6. No explicit proceeds from sale of fixed assets or investments shown.\n\n7. No cash inflows or outflows related to investments or asset purchases other than initial fixed asset balance which is opening balance, no cash flow.\n\n**Therefore, no cash flows from investing activities except the initial fixed asset amount which is balance, not a cash flow during the period.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIf no investing cash inflows or outflows occurred during the period (no asset purchases or asset sales), the net cash flow from investing activities = 0.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0\"}}\n```",
