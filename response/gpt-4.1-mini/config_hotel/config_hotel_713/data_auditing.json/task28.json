Also the Initial lines for Cash deposit and Bank deposit sum to $8,000,000 together. Given the example at start, the Fixed Assets was $5,000,000. So $8,000,000 is inconsistent. Corrected amount is $5,000,000.\n\n- For \"Purchase20231231001\":\n\n  - The product_id is recorded as \"F002\" (Business Meal Set), but unit price is 350 and quantity is 206, total $72,100 which matches 350*206.\n\n  - The original example shows this id's product_id as \"P001\" for Chemical Product A for similar values, but here product name is \"Business Meal Set\" - so likely product_id is \"F002\" is consistent with product_name.\n\n  - So no direct inconsistency, except the preparer is recorded as \"Supervisor\" whereas in example it was often \"Staff\".\n\n  Given instructions, preparer \"Supervisor\" vs \"Staff\" may not be a critical inconsistency.\n\n- Other records are consistent.\n\nNote: Only obvious inconsistencies in amount, date, price, quantity, or identifers are corrected. Preparer differences are not considered errors unless otherwise stated.\n\nIf more entries with noticeable issues found, would have been included likewise.\n\n```",
