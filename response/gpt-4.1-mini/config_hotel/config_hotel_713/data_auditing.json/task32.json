Since we have no quantity or unit price for this line and the invoice and recorded amount both say 8000000.0, this is likely the correct amount.\n- Other fields for this transaction have no explicit inconsistency noted.\n- Other transactions' values appear consistent based on their recorded quantities, unit prices, and amounts as stated.\n- Hence, only the Fixed Assets transaction for `Initial20231231001` shows a discrepancy in the problem statement (between example and problem input), so correction is provided accordingly.\n```",
