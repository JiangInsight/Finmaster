Fixed Assets transaction shows a recorded amount (8000000.0) inconsistent with standard expected and described invoice total (likely 5000000.0).\n- \"Sale20240118065\" has a discrepancy in recorded unit price (3113.77) vs what the invoice suggests (2604.73), leading to wrong tax and totals.\n- \"Sale20240125044\" has a recorded unit price lower than the invoice stated price (24944.50 vs 24990.50).\n- Interest receivable transactions on 2024-01-10 and 2024-01-11 have negative recorded amounts, which is inconsistent with normal positive interest receivable amounts.\n\nNote: Minor typographical discrepancy \"Interest receviable\" vs \"Interest receivable\" accepted for receive_method. The correction focuses on numeric and financial inconsistencies primarily.",
