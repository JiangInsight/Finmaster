                        "content": "First, let's identify all the key values from the provided data to plug into the ratios formulas.\n\n---\n\n### Given data (End amounts mostly, at 2024-02-05):\n\n- **Operating Cash Flow (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities):**  \n  -2,868,695.86\n\n- **Current Liabilities (Total Current Liabilities):**  \n  5,042,389.63\n\n- **Total Liabilities:**  \n  Total Liabilities = Total Assets - Total Owner's Equity  \n  = 21,098,887.48 - 16,056,497.85  \n  = 5,042,389.63 (which matches current liabilities, so all liabilities are current?)\n\n- **Owner's Equity:**  \n  16,056,497.85\n\n- **Total Assets:**  \n  21,098,887.48\n\n- **Accounts Receivable (End):**  \n  200,359.99\n\n- **Revenue (Total Revenue / Main Business Revenue):**  \n  547,392.30\n\n- **Net Profit:**  \n  56,497.85\n\n- **Inventory:**  \n  7,848,830.00\n\n- **Interest Receivable:**  \n  9,881.70\n\n- **Cash and Cash Equivalents:**  \n  Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits = 2,179,154.14 + 2,952,150.00 = 5,131,304.14\n\n- **Quick Assets:**  \n  Cash and Cash Equivalents + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable  \n  = 5,131,304.14 + 200,359.99 + 9,881.70 = 5,341,545.83\n\n- **Accounts Payable:**  \n  5,015,020.00\n\n- **Taxes Payable:**  \n  27,369.63\n\n- **Total Current Liabilities:**  \n  5,042,389.63 (given, matches sum of accounts payable + taxes payable)\n\n---\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \n= Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n= -2,868,695.86 / 5,042,389.63  \n= approx -0.569 or -0.57 (rounded 2 decimal places)\n\n---\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio  \nDebt = Total Liabilities (here, current liabilities as no long-term liabilities stated) = 5,042,389.63  \nEquity = 16,056,497.85  \n\nDebt to Equity = Debt / Equity  \n= 5,042,389.63 / 16,056,497.85  \n= approx 0.314 (rounded 3 decimals)\n\n---\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n= Total Revenue / Total Assets  \n= 547,392.30 / 21,098,887.48  \n= approx 0.0259 or 0.03 (rounded 2 decimals)\n\n---\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio  \nQuick Assets / Current Liabilities  \n= 5,341,545.83 / 5,042,389.63  \n= approx 1.059 or 1.06 (rounded 2 decimals)\n\n---\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities (same as Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio here)  \n= -2,868,695.86 / 5,042,389.63  \n= approx -0.57\n\n---\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)  \n= Net Profit / Owner's Equity  \n= 56,497.85 / 16,056,497.85  \n= approx 0.00352 or 0.35% (rounded 2 decimals)\n\nExpressed as percentage: 0.35%\n\n---\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \nFormula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable.\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales as no cash sales data.  \n- Net Credit Sales = 547,392.30\n\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR)/2  \nGiven beginning AR = 0.00, ending AR = 200,359.99  \nAverage AR = (0 + 200,359.99)/2 = 100,179.995\n\nTherefore,  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover = 547,392.30 / 100,179.995  \n= approx 5.46\n\n---\n\n### Final answers:\n\n- operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio = -0.57  \n- Debt to Equity Ratio = 0.31  \n- Total Asset Turnover Ratio = 0.03  \n- Quick Ratio = 1.06  \n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -0.57  \n- Return on Equity (ROE) = 0.35%  \n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 5.46\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.57\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.31\", \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.03\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.06\", \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.57\", \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"0.35%\", \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"5.46\"}}\n```\n",
