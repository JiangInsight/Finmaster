The question specifically asks for the \"value of decrease in amounts owed to the entity\", which corresponds to a positive value on this line if accounts receivable decreased.\n\nStep 4: Since the amount is -200359.99, which is negative, this indicates an increase in amounts owed to the entity, not a decrease.\n\nTherefore, there is no decrease in amounts owed to the entity during this period â€” the value provided is negative, indicating an increase.\n\nStep 5: The problem requests to \"identify and extract the specific line items and value of decrease\". Since no decrease occurred, the value is simply the line item and its respective amount from the statement.\n\nGiven the example, we should return the value field from \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\", regardless of sign, as it represents the change in amounts owed to the entity.\n\nHence, the answer is the absolute value from the line item, i.e., the number as is: -200359.99.\n\nBut, as the question specifically says \"decrease in amounts owed\", and the value is negative, indicating an increase and not a decrease, the decrease is zero or none.\n\nThus for clarity and per the example, since the line exists, extract the value as is.\n\nAnswer: \"-200359.99\"\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-200359.99\"}}\n```\n\n# Note:  \nIf the task wants just decreases (positive changes meaning account decreased), and if the value is negative there is no decrease, the answer might be \"0.00\" or no value. But following the example, extracting the value as is.",
