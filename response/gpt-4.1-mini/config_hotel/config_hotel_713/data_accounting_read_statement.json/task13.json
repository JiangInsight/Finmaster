                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to identify the value of total assets that are not expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle. This typically corresponds to \"Non-current Assets\" or \"Fixed Assets,\" as these are long-term assets held for use, not for sale or consumption.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. From the balance sheet, the relevant line item is \"Total Non-current Assets\" or the related \"Fixed Assets\" net of accumulated depreciation.\n2. The initial value given for \"Total Non-current Assets\" is 8,000,000.00 at 2023-12-31.\n3. The end value given for \"Total Non-current Assets\" is 7,908,511.65 at 2024-02-05.\n4. These represent the assets not intended for sale or consumption in the normal operating cycle.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"7908511.65\"} }\n```",
