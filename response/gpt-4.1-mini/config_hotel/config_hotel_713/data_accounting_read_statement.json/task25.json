                        "content": "To identify costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services, we look at line items that relate to sales effort and direct delivery costs.\n\n- \"Selling Expenses\" usually involve costs related to securing customer orders (advertising, sales force expenses, commissions).\n- \"Cost of Goods Sold\" covers the direct cost of producing/delivering goods and services to customers.\n\nAdministrative expenses are typically overhead, not directly tied to securing/delivering sales. Depreciation and financial expenses are not relevant here.\n\nHence, the relevant costs from the statement are:\n\n- Selling Expenses: 14714.68\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 353220.00\n\nThe problem asks for \"specific line items and value of costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services\" — so both should be included.\n\nBut according to the examples and instructions, usually only the value for \"Selling Expenses\" is extracted as costs to secure orders.\n\nHowever \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is to deliver goods.\n\nTherefore, combining these two would represent full cost to secure and deliver.\n\nYet the example only picks \"Selling Expenses\" value.\n\nGiven that, likely the expected answer is Selling Expenses value, because it says \"costs incurred to secure customer orders\" → Selling Expenses;\n\nand \"to deliver the goods and services\" → Cost of Goods Sold.\n\nSo possibly both together.\n\nBut since the example extracted only Selling Expenses showing cost to secure orders, and the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" line is also given, it is better to combine these costs.\n\nSince the problem wants to identify and extract \"the specific line items and value\", I will output them both.\n\nBut the output format based on example shows only one value.\n\nIf only one value, \"Selling Expenses\" matches the example.\n\nIf we include both, possibly it should be the sum.\n\nHence, safer to provide the sum of both:\n\n353220.00 + 14714.68 = 368934.68\n\nBut to match the example format, only one value is allowed.\n\nHence, the answer could be:\n\n{\"solution\": {'value': '368934.68'} }\n\nOr output the two values separately:\n\n{\"solution\": {'value': '353220.00 (Cost of Goods Sold), 14714.68 (Selling Expenses)'} }\n\nGiven the example only shows one numeric value in string, let's provide the sum.\n\n# Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"368934.68\"}}\n```",
