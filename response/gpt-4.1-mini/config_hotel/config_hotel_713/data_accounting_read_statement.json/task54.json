The costs related to securing customer orders and delivering goods/services are typically captured under \"Selling Expenses\" or sometimes included in \"Cost of Goods Sold\" depending on the accounting treatment, but primarily, it's \"Selling Expenses.\"\n\n2. From the income statement:\n   - Cost of Goods Sold: 353,220.00 (cost related to production/delivery of goods)\n   - Selling Expenses: 14,714.68 (expenses related to selling, i.e., securing orders and delivery costs)\n\n3. \"Selling Expenses\" is a more direct line item explicitly referring to costs incurred to secure orders and deliver goods/services to customers.\n\nTherefore, the value we should extract is the \"Selling Expenses\" amount of 14,714.68.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"14714.68\"} }\n```",
