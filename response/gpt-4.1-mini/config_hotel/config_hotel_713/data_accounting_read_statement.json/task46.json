The task is to identify and extract the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities related to:\n   - Acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents.\n   - Receipt of interest and dividends.\n   \n2. From the cash flow statement given, these activities usually are found in the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section.\n\n3. Reviewing the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section:\n   - \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = 0.00\n   - \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" = -0.00\n\n4. Since there is zero purchase or disposal recorded (\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is 0.00) and the net cash flow from investing activities is -0.00, it implies no cash generated or used from those activities.\n\n5. No other line items are present for receipt of interest or dividends explicitly.\n\n6. Therefore:\n   - The net amount of cash and equivalents generated from acquisition/disposal and interest/dividends = 0.00\n   - One sub-item that comes from the input is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = 0.00\n\nHence the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"0.00\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"0.00\"}}\n```\n\n(Note: The format requested is key 'sub_items_sub_item value', so following that strictly.)\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"0.00\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
