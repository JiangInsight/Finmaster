From the provided data, the relevant line item is \"Interest Receivable\" as it represents the interest accrued but not yet received.\n\n3. Checking the balance sheet:\n   - Initial amount of \"Interest Receivable\" is 0.00 on 2023-12-31\n   - End amount of \"Interest Receivable\" is 9881.70 on 2024-02-05\n\n4. This matches also with the cash flow statement showing \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" at -9881.70, and the income statement showing \"Interest Income\" of 9881.70, consistent with the accrued interest.\n\nTherefore,\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"9881.70\"}}\n```",
