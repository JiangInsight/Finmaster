The first required line item is \"the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life,\" which corresponds to **Depreciation**.\n   - From the data: Depreciation = 115511.91\n\n2. The second required line item is \"reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period.\"\n   - This is usually reflected as changes in inventory or similar line items.\n   - Here the suitable line item is **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**, which is -8466430.00\n\n3. The third required line item is \"net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends.\" \n   - This corresponds to **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**.\n   - From the data: Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -1213417.20\n\n4. The fourth required line item is \"net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period.\"\n   - This corresponds to **Net Increase** in cash and cash equivalents.\n   - From the data: Net Increase = -2180564.22\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"115511.91\", \"value2\": \"-8466430.00\", \"value3\": \"-1213417.20\", \"value4\": \"-2180564.22\"}}\n```",
