Typically, in an income statement, the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) represents the cost of the inventory that was sold during the period.\n3. From the given problem data, the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" has an amount of 496220.00.\n4. Therefore, the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is 496220.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"496220.00\"} }\n```",
