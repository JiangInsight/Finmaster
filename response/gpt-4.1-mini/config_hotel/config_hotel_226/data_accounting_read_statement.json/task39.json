But since the line is labeled \"(Increase) Decrease\", the amount itself represents the net amount of this change.\n- Therefore, the reduction amount in the assets held for sale in the ordinary course is represented by this line item.\n  \nHence, we take the value from \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": -8466430.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-8466430.00\"} }\n```",
