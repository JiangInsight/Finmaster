                        "content": "To identify the costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services, we should look at:\n\n- **Selling Expenses**: These typically include costs related to sales activities, marketing, and distribution which are directly related to securing customer orders.\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: This represents the direct costs of producing the goods or services sold, including materials and labor, which are related to delivering the goods or services.\n\nFrom the income statement:\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 496220.00\n- Selling Expenses: 10967.95\n\nAdministrative Expenses, Depreciation, Financial Expenses are typically not directly related to securing orders or delivering goods to customers.\n\nTherefore, the specific line items and values related to the costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services are:\n\n- Selling Expenses: 10,967.95\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 496,220.00\n\n**However**, in the example provided, only the Selling Expenses were extracted as the solution because the example explicitly took only the \"Selling Expenses\" as the cost incurred to secure customer orders and deliver the goods/services to customers.\n\nBut since the task says \"Based on the income statement, identify and extract the specific line items and value of costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers\", we can consider both Selling Expenses (to secure customer orders) and Cost of Goods Sold (to deliver goods/services).\n\nIf a combined total is requested, sum both:\n\n496220.00 + 10967.95 = 507187.95\n\nSince the problem does not explicitly specify what to return (line items separately or combined), but based on the example that returns only Selling Expenses (which relates to securing orders and delivery costs), the safe answer is to output only the \"Selling Expenses\".\n\nHence, the solution based on the example format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '10967.95'} }\n```\n\n# Final answer: \n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"10967.95\"}}\n```",
