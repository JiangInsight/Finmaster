                        "content": "Let's carefully identify and extract the required values:\n\nWe need three specific line items and final values:\n\n1. Value before deducting tax expense (Profit Before Tax) from the Income Statement.\n2. The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period - this refers to the increase (addition) in Accounts Payable from the Balance Sheet or Cash Flow Statement.\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares - typically \"Paid-in Capital\" from the Balance Sheet.\n\nOrder and grouping are:\n\n1. Balance Sheet items\n2. Income Statement items\n3. Cash Flow Statement items\n\nBut the problem instructs to group outputs by financial statement in the order:\n\n1. Balance Sheet  \n2. Income Statement  \n3. Cash Flow Statement  \n\nAnd maintain the original line item order.\n\nFrom the problem, the required items:\n\n- 1) Line item with the end value of profit or loss before deducting tax: \"Profit Before Tax\" from the Income Statement: 151155.01\n- 2) The addition in amount owed for goods or services purchased on credit: increase in Accounts Payable from Balance Sheet (end amount): 7,566,370.00 or from Cash Flow Statement \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" 7,566,370.00. The problem says addition in amount owed - so the increase in Accounts Payable is the relevant figure. The Balance Sheet shows the \"End_amount\" for Accounts Payable as 7,566,370.00 while Initial_amount was 0.00, so addition = 7,566,370.00.\n  \n- 3) Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares: \"Paid-in Capital\" from Balance Sheet at end date: 16,000,000.00.\n\nSo the three values extracted are:\n\nFrom Balance Sheet:\n- Capital contributed by shareholders: Paid-in Capital = 16000000.00\n- Amount owed (Accounts Payable) = 7566370.00 (But the problem says group by financial statement; since we have to include the addition in amount owed, which is the increase in Accounts Payable, and driver says specifically \"addition in amount owed\", that corresponds to Accounts Payable line)\n\nFrom Income Statement:\n- Profit Before Tax = 151155.01\n\nBut the instruction says order of outputs: 1. Balance Sheet, 2. Income Statement, 3. Cash Flow Statement.\n\nAnd per the example, the \"addition in the amount owed\" is from the Balance Sheet.\n\nThe example solution shows:\n\n{'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '-1373590.51', 'value3': '1590000.00'}\n\nvalue1 - Paid-in Capital (Balance Sheet)  \nvalue2 - Profit Before Tax (Income Statement)  \nvalue3 - Addition in Accounts Payable (Cash Flow Statement \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\")\n\nSo per the example, the addition (increase) in Accounts Payable is taken from Cash Flow Statement line \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n\nTherefore, the correct extraction is:\n\n- Value1 (from Balance Sheet, Paid-in Capital): 16000000.00  \n- Value2 (from Income Statement, Profit Before Tax): 151155.01  \n- Value3 (from Cash Flow Statement, Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable): 7566370.00\n\nThis matches the example so let's put it in that format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16000000.00', 'value2': '151155.01', 'value3': '7566370.00'}}\n```\n\n# Final answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16000000.00', 'value2': '151155.01', 'value3': '7566370.00'}}\n```",
