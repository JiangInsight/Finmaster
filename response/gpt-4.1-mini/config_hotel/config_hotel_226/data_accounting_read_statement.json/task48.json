The task asks for two specific line items from the cash flow statement that represent the profit retained after all expenses:\n   - The first is the line item showing the amount of profit after all expenses such as operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization have been deducted. This is typically shown as \"Net Profit\".\n   - The second is the cash payments to acquire property, plant, equipment, and other long-term assets, which is usually represented as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n\n2. From the problem:\n   - \"Net Profit\" is 112375.10\n   - \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is 1213417.20\n\n3. These are in the order they appear in the cash flow statement.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"112375.10\", \"value2\": \"1213417.20\"}}\n```",
