We need to identify two values as per the task:\n   - Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services to customers. This usually corresponds to \"Selling Expenses\" or similar expense line items on the **Income Statement**.\n   - Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets. This will be the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" or similar on the **Cash Flow Statement** under investing activities.\n\n2. From the **Income Statement**, relevant line items include:\n   - Selling Expenses: 10967.95 (likely representing costs to secure orders and deliver goods/services)\n   - Other expense related to administrative costs and depreciation, but selling expenses directly correspond to delivery and securing customers.\n\n3. From the **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 1213417.20 (representing cash payments for fixed assets)\n\n4. The **Balance Sheet** does not have a specific line item about costs for orders or deliveries or purchase payments but only total asset and liability values.\n\n5. So, grouping as per instruction:\n   - Income Statement: Selling Expenses = 10967.95\n   - Cash Flow Statement: Purchase of Fixed Assets = 1213417.20\n\n6. The task expects output as:\n   - value1 = costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver (selling expenses)\n   - value2 = cash payments to acquire fixed assets (purchase of fixed assets)\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"10967.95\", \"value2\": \"1213417.20\"}}\n```",
