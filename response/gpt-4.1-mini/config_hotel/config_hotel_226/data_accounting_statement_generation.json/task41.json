Identify all the purchase transactions marked as **Unpaid** (Account Payable) to find the total accounts payable balance.\n2. These unpaid purchases represent the accounts payable outstanding at the end of the period.\n3. Identify any initial accounts payable at the beginning of the period. In this data, initial records are provided on 2023-12-31.\n4. The change in accounts payable = Ending accounts payable balance - Beginning accounts payable balance.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Identify Initial Accounts Payable (as of 2023-12-31)**\n\n- From the data, check purchases with \"Unpaid\" status on the start date (2023-12-31).\n- Initial unpaid purchases on 2023-12-31 (Accounts Payable):\n\n| Purchase ID          | Amount    |\n|---------------------|-----------|\n| Purchase20231231002  | 696,960.0 |\n| Purchase20231231003  | 394,560.0 |\n| Purchase20231231004  | 286,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231009  | 43,400.0  |\n| Purchase20231231015  | 800,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231016  | 685,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231019  |1,075,000.0|\n| Purchase20231231020  | 236,720.0 |\n| Purchase20231231023  | 235,500.0 |\n| Purchase20231231013  | 466,560.0 |\n| Purchase20231231021  |1,115,000.0|\n| Purchase20231231025  | 570,240.0 |\n| Purchase20231231008  | 544,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231017  | 78,400.0  |\n| Purchase20231231022  | 88,880.0  |\n\nLet's sum these for the initial outstanding accounts payable:\n\nSum initial unpaid purchases =  \n696,960 + 394,560 + 286,000 + 43,400 + 800,000 + 685,000 + 1,075,000 + 236,720 + 235,500 + 466,560 + 1,115,000 + 570,240 + 544,000 + 78,400 + 88,880\n\nCalculate stepwise:\n\n- 696,960 + 394,560 = 1,091,520  \n- +286,000 = 1,377,520  \n- +43,400 = 1,420,920  \n- +800,000 = 2,220,920  \n- +685,000 = 2,905,920  \n- +1,075,000 = 3,980,920  \n- +236,720 = 4,217,640  \n- +235,500 = 4,453,140  \n- +466,560 = 4,919,700  \n- +1,115,000 = 6,034,700  \n- +570,240 = 6,604,940  \n- +544,000 = 7,148,940  \n- +78,400 = 7,227,340  \n- +88,880 = 7,316,220  \n\n**Initial Accounts Payable balance = 7,316,220.00**\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify Ending Accounts Payable**\n\n- Ending date is 2024-02-02 (last date in the data).\n- Accounts Payable at the end will be all purchases still unpaid at the last recorded date. \n- Check purchases with \"Unpaid\" status for accounts payable in entire dataset (since all unpaid entries are cumulative).\n- Since all purchases with \"Unpaid\" status have dates mostly at 2023-12-31 with no payments reducing them explicitly, we consider only those purchases units marked as unpaid.\n\nActually, initial purchases on 2023-12-31 with unpaid status represent the starting balance (since the table indicates initial date for unpaid). There are no later purchase transactions in 2024 identified as unpaid in the given data, so the accounts payable at the period end is the same set unless any of those purchases have payments clearing them.\n\n**Now check any purchases marked as \"Paid\" (means payment made), reducing accounts payable.**\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- Some purchases on 2023-12-31 or later are marked as \"Paid\" and will reduce accounts payable.\n- These are *paid* purchases and thus reduce accounts payable.\n\nCalculate total *paid* purchases (those with \"Paid\" status and purchase type):\n\nFrom the dataset:\n\n| Purchase ID          | Amount    | Payment status |\n|----------------------|-----------|----------------|\n| Purchase20231231001   | 35,400.0  | Paid           |\n| Purchase20231231005   | 421,500.0 | Paid           |\n| Purchase20231231006   | 64,400.0  | Paid           |\n| Purchase20231231007   | 470,000.0 | Paid           |\n| Purchase20231231024   | 259,600.0 | Paid           |\n| Purchase20231231014   | 34,500.0  | Paid           |\n| Purchase20231231011   | 163,500.0 | Unpaid (skip)  |\n| Purchase20231231010   | 21,900.0  | Unpaid (skip)  |\n| Purchase20231231022   | 88,880.0  | Unpaid (counted in initial) |\n| Purchase20231231017   | 78,400.0  | Unpaid (initial)|\n| Purchase20231231008   | 544,000.0 | Unpaid (initial)|\n| Purchase20231231013   | 466,560.0 | Unpaid (initial)|\n| Purchase20231231021   |1,115,000.0| Unpaid (initial)|\n| Purchase20231231015   | 800,000.0 | Unpaid (initial)|\n| Purchase20231231020   | 236,720.0 | Unpaid (initial)|\n| Purchase20231231023   | 235,500.0 | Unpaid (initial)|\n\nSum of paid purchases:\n35,400 + 421,500 + 64,400 + 470,000 + 259,600 + 34,500\n\nCalculate:\n- 35,400 + 421,500 = 456,900  \n- +64,400 = 521,300  \n- +470,000 = 991,300  \n- +259,600 = 1,250,900  \n- +34,500 = 1,285,400  \n\nTotal paid purchases = 1,285,400.00\n\nThese paid purchases are not part of accounts payable anymore.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Ending Accounts Payable**\n\n- Total initial unpaid purchases = 7,316,220  \n- Less purchases paid = 1,285,400  \n- Ending accounts payable = 7,316,220 - 1,285,400 = 6,030,820.00  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Increase (Decrease) in accounts payable**\n\n- Initial accounts payable (start) = 7,316,220  \n- Ending accounts payable (end) = 6,030,820  \n- Change = Ending - Initial = 6,030,820 - 7,316,220 = -1,285,400  \n\nThis is a *decrease* in accounts payable by 1,285,400.\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"-1285400.00\"}}\n```",
