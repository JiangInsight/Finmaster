The relevant entries are those with:\n\n- type indicating fixed asset purchase (such as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\")\n- asset_name and asset_type fields populated indicating investing assets\n- payment_method indicating actual payment (e.g., \"Bank Transfer\" or \"Cash\")\n- paid status, indicating actual cash outflow\n\nNo sale of fixed assets is listed here, so cash inflow from sale of fixed assets is zero.\n\n**Step 1: Identify fixed asset purchases with cash/bank payment**\n\nFrom the data:\n\n1) FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | amount: 830405.75 | Paid | Bank Transfer | S003  \n   - asset_name: Central AC4 | asset_type: Central AC\n\n2) FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | amount: 383011.45 | Paid | Bank Transfer | S007  \n   - asset_name: Kitchen Equipment5 | asset_type: Kitchen Equipment\n\nAll other fixed asset-related entries either do not have payment or are not purchases.\n\n**Step 2: Sum these amounts**\n\n830,405.75 + 383,011.45 = 1,213,417.20\n\n**Step 3: Consider if there are fixed asset sales with cash inflow**\n\nNo fixed asset sales found in the data.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate net cash flow from investing activities**\n\nNet cash flow from investing activities = Cash inflows from asset sales - Cash outflows for asset purchases  \n= 0 - 1,213,417.20  \n= -1,213,417.20\n\nThis means net cash outflow from investing activities is 1,213,417.20.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-1213417.20\"}}\n```",
