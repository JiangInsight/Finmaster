Actually recorded quantity is 2? No, recorded quantity is 2? Actually the row has quantity 2? No, recorded quantity is 2? Let me check:  \nActually in the original problem, recorded_quantity is 2.0 or 2? For Sale20240110016: recorded_quantity=2?  \nNo, recorded_quantity=2? The problem data says 2.0 units at unit price $62344.08, total $124688.16.  \nRecorded amount is 138369.24, which is inconsistent.  \nHence original amount should be 124688.16.\n  \nOutput for this inconsistency:\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Original date\": \"2024-01-10\",\n    \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-10\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n    \"Original payment_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n    \"Original quantity\": \"2.0\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"2.0\",\n    \"Original price\": \"62344.08\",\n    \"Recorded price\": \"62344.08\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n    \"Original amount\": \"124688.16\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"138369.24\",\n    \"Original tax\": \"6234.41\",\n    \"Recorded tax\": \"6234.41\",\n    \"Original profit\": \"24688.16\",\n    \"Recorded profit\": \"24688.16\",\n    \"Original Preparer\": null,\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n    \"Original Approver\": null,\n    \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240110016\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3) Interest Receivables negative amounts spotted: Interest20240110010 (-54.77), Interest20240111011 (-19.17), Interest20240128028 (-56.55), Interest20240127027 (-92.15)  \nGenerally, interest receivables should not be negative.
