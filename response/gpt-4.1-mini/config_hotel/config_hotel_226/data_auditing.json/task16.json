Hence the recorded amount is inconsistent with quantity and unit price.\n\n  - Recorded payment/receipt_status is \"Unpaid\" but \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued... The payment_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\" suggests original status should be \"Paid\".\n\nThe rest of the fields match the details given.",
