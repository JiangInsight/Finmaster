However, since the invoice narrative states 8,000,000.0 and invoice is reliable, the original amount should be considered 8,000,000.0 as shown in the problem.\n- Other entries for the same ID correspond to different types, so each is separate.\n- No inconsistencies were found for this record since the invoice states 8,000,000.0 and recorded amount matches the invoice.\n- Other fields are empty or consistent.\n\nNote: If the problem intended to highlight the difference as error, this corrected value conforms to invoice stated amount (8 million) instead of 5 million previously recorded amount.",
