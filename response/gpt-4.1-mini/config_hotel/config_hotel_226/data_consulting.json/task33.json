                        "content": "To solve the problem, let's first identify and collect the necessary values from the financial statements to calculate each ratio:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio (Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities)\n\n- Operating Cash Flow (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities): -967147.02\n- Current Liabilities (at period end): 7,605,149.91\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n= -967147.02 / 7,605,149.91 ≈ -0.1271\n\n---\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio (Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt)\n\n- Operating Cash Flow: -967147.02\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities + Non-current Liabilities  \nFrom the balance sheet, only Current Liabilities are given, no other liabilities specified, so Total Debt = Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91\n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt  \n= -967147.02 / 7,605,149.91 ≈ -0.1271\n\n---\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio (Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory)\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): 496,220.00\n- Inventory at beginning: 0.00 (from initial balance sheet)\n- Inventory at end: 8,466,430.00  \nAverage Inventory = (0 + 8,466,430.00) / 2 = 4,233,215.00\n\nInventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory = 496,220 / 4,233,215 ≈ 0.1172\n\n---\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio (Total Debt / Total Equity)\n\n- Total Debt = Current Liabilities (no other liabilities): 7,605,149.91\n- Total Owner's Equity: 16,112,375.10\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Equity = 7,605,149.91 / 16,112,375.10 ≈ 0.472\n\n---\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio ((Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities)\n\n- Current Assets: 14,619,619.72\n- Inventory: 8,466,430.00\n- Current Liabilities: 7,605,149.91\n\nQuick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 14,619,619.72 - 8,466,430 = 6,153,189.72\n\nQuick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities = 6,153,189.72 / 7,605,149.91 ≈ 0.809\n\n---\n\n### 6. Current Ratio (Current Assets / Current Liabilities)\n\nCurrent Ratio = 14,619,619.72 / 7,605,149.91 ≈ 1.922\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Ratio                    | Value    |\n|--------------------------|----------|\n| Operating Cash Flow Ratio | -0.13    |\n| Cash Flow to Debt Ratio   | -0.13    |\n| Inventory Turnover Ratio  | 0.12     |\n| Debt to Equity Ratio      | 0.47     |\n| Quick Ratio              | 0.81     |\n| Current Ratio             | 1.92     |\n\n---\n\n### Final JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.13\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.13\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"0.12\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.47\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.81\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"1.92\"\n  }\n}\n```",
