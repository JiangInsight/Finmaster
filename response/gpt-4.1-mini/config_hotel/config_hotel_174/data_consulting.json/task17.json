In this case, only Current Liabilities are given (Total Current Liabilities). There is no explicit mention of long-term liabilities so we will consider total debt as just the total current liabilities.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,504,752.68\n\n### Step 2: Identify Total Debt\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,389,719.66\n- No other liabilities given, so Total Debt = 3,389,719.66\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-4,504,752.68}{3,389,719.66} \\approx -1.33\n\\]\n\n### Interpretation:\nThe ratio is negative indicating that cash flow from operating activities is negative relative to debt, which might signal liquidity or operational issues.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-1.33\"}}\n```",
