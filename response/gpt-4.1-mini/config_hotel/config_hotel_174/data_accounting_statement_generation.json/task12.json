                        "content": "To find the accounts payable item in the balance sheet, including both the initial and final amounts, we need to:\n\n1. Identify the initial accounts payable balance from the initial records on 2023-12-31.\n2. Calculate the net change in accounts payable from purchase transactions that are marked as \"Unpaid\" or related payment status.\n3. The ending accounts payable will be the initial plus increases from unpaid purchases minus decreases from paid purchases.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Accounts Payable\n\nLook if there are any initial accounts payable values recorded at 2023-12-31.\n\n- The initial entries with type \"Initial20231231001\" do not specify accounts payable—only Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets.\n- So from initial data, the initial accounts payable is **0.00**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate all Purchase transactions with payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\" or related to Account Payable\n\nWe consider only **Purchases with payment_method \"Account Payable\" and payment/receipt_status \"Unpaid\"** to add to accounts payable.\n\nFrom the data, purchases with \"Account Payable\" payment method and \"Unpaid\" status are:\n\n- Purchase20231231002: 80500.0 (Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231003: 342000.0 (Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231006: 406000.0 (Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231007: 137280.0 (Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231012: 288000.0 (Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231013: 103600.0 (Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231016: 665280.0 (Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231018: 316500.0 (Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231019: (this one was \"Paid\" by cash, so skip)\n- Purchase20231231020: 299520.0 (Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231021: 348000.0 (Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231015: 132880.0 (Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231017: 230560.0 (Account Payable)\n\nSum these unpaid purchases:\n\n80500 + 342000 + 406000 + 137280 + 288000 + 103600 + 665280 + 316500 + 299520 + 348000 + 132880 + 230560 + 288000 (Note: 288000 considered only once from 12 and last is 230560)\n\nWait, verify entries carefully:\n\n- Purchase20231231012: 288000.0 (Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231020: 299520.0\n- Purchase20231231021: 348000.0\n- Purchase20231231017: 230560.0\n\nListing all unpaid purchase amounts explicitly and adding:\n\n80500  \n+ 342000  \n+ 406000  \n+ 137280  \n+ 288000  \n+ 103600  \n+ 665280  \n+ 316500  \n+ 299520  \n+ 348000  \n+ 132880  \n+ 230560  \n\nNow adding stepwise:\n\n- 80500 + 342000 = 422500  \n- 422500 + 406000 = 828500  \n- 828500 + 137280 = 965780  \n- 965780 + 288000 = 1,253,780  \n- 1,253,780 + 103,600 = 1,357,380  \n- 1,357,380 + 665,280 = 2,022,660  \n- 2,022,660 + 316,500 = 2,339,160  \n- 2,339,160 + 299,520 = 2,638,680  \n- 2,638,680 + 348,000 = 2,986,680  \n- 2,986,680 + 132,880 = 3,119,560  \n- 3,119,560 + 230,560 = 3,350,120\n\nTotal unpaid purchases = 3,350,120\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate all Purchases with payment_method \"Account Payable\" and payment/receipt_status = \"Paid\"\n\nWe subtract these from accounts payable as they have been settled.\n\nFrom the data, purchases with \"Account Payable\" payment method and status \"Paid\":\n\n- Purchase20231231004: 43350.0 (Paid by Cash - not Account Payable, skip)\n- Purchase20231231007: 1310000.0 (Paid by Cash, skip)\n- Purchase20231231009: 763200.0 (Paid by Bank Transfer, skip)\n- Purchase20231231010: 315000.0 (Paid by Cash, skip)\n- Purchase20231231011: 36450.0 (Paid by Cash, skip)\n- Purchase20231231014: 339000.0 (Paid by Bank Transfer, skip)\n- Purchase20231231008: 1310000.0 (Paid by cash, skip)\n- Purchase20231231005: 1480000.0 (Paid by Bank Transfer, skip)\n- Purchase20231231018: 316500.0 – this is unpaid above.\n- No other purchase shows \"Account Payable\" and \"Paid\" status.\n\nFrom this we conclude no \"Account Payable\" purchases are marked as paid explicitly in this data, so no subtractions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Step - Initial Value + New Unpaid Purchases - Paid Account Payables\n\n- Initial Accounts Payable = 0.00\n- Total unpaid purchases = 3,350,120.00\n- Total payments on account payable = 0.00\n\nTherefore,  \n**Accounts Payable End Value = 3,350,120.00**\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"3350120.00\"}}\n```",
