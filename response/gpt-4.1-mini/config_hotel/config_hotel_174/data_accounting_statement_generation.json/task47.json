5,000,000.0\n   - Total initial cash and cash equivalents = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000.0\n\n2. **Add Cash Receipts (Cash inflows):**\n   - Include only transactions where payment_method is \"Cash\" or receipts received in \"Cash\".\n   - Sales income with \"Cash\" receive_method or payment_method \"Cash\" and Payment/Receipt status \"Paid\".\n   - Also consider any cash-inflow not restricted to other payment methods.\n\n3. **Subtract Cash Payments (Cash outflows):**\n   - Include only transactions with payment_method \"Cash\" and payment_status \"Paid\".\n   - Expenses paid by \"Cash\".\n   - Purchases paid by \"Cash\".\n   - Transfers from Cash to Bank reduce cash.\n\n4. **Ignore non-cash transactions:**\n   - Unpaid transactions do not affect cash balance.\n   - Account Payable or Account Receivable payments will not affect cash until paid in cash.\n   - Bank transfers just move between cash and bank deposits; in cash calculation, the bank deposit transfers are not part of cash but cash to bank transfers will reduce cash.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial cash and bank deposits\n\n- Starting cash: 3,000,000.0\n- Starting bank: 5,000,000.0 --> This is bank deposit, not cash and equivalents, but bank deposits count as cash equivalents.\n- Total starting cash and cash equivalents = 8,000,000.0\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze cash inflows (Cash receipts):\n\nGo through all sales with payment/receipt_status \"Paid\" and payment_method or receive_method indicating Cash.\n\nFrom the dataset (only relevant entries):\n\n- Sale20240102003: 516.72 paid in Cash\n-

Transfer20240125001 on 2024-01-25: three entries of 50,000 each = 150,000\n- Transfer20240125001 on 2024-01-25: another three entries 50,000 each, but these seem duplicates in the raw data? (Only given three times)\n- No other cash transfers seen except these.\n\nSum all distinct Cash to Bank transfers in full view: From the data:\n\n- Several transfers with 50,000 or 100,000 amounts but mostly with no payment_method or not cash outflows directly: But note transfers reduce cash balance.\n\nReview the transfers that reduce cash:\n\n- Transfer on 2024-01-25: three times 50,000, total 150,000 cash outflow\n- No other cash transfers out clearly visible (other transfers are labeled \"Cash to bank transfer\" meaning cash decreases)\n\nAlso, there are some purchases paid by Bank Transfer which don't affect cash.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final cash and cash equivalents calculation:\n\nStarting cash and cash equivalents:  \n8,000,000.0\n\nAdd: Cash sales received (paid status):  \n+366,818.92\n\nSubtract: Cash Purchases paid:  \n-2,127,550.0\n\nSubtract: Cash Expenses paid:  \n-18,651.51\n\nSubtract: Cash to Bank transfers:  \n-150,000.0\n\nNet cash and cash equivalents = 8,000,000 + 366,818.92 - 2,127,550 - 18,651.51 - 150,000  \n= 8,000,000 + 366,818.92 - 2,296,201.51  \n= 8,366,818.92 - 2,296,201.51  \n= 6,070,617.41\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Double-check for any other cash inflows/outflows\n\n- Interest income is unpaid, so no cash impact.\n- Sales unpaid do not affect cash.\n- Purchases unpaid do not affect cash.\n- Depreciation is non-cash.\n- Fixed asset purchases are \"Paid\" by Bank Transfer, so no effect on cash.\n- Cash deposit initial is included.\n- Bank deposit initial included as cash equivalents.\n\nHence, the calculated amount is approximately **6,070,617.41**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"6070617.41\"}}\n```",
