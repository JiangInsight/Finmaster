                        "content": "To calculate the property, plant and non-current assets item in the balance sheet (initial and final amounts), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial value of non-current assets at the starting date (2023-12-31).\n2. Add any purchases of fixed assets/non-current assets during the period.\n3. Subtract depreciation during the period.\n4. The result will be the ending balance of non-current assets.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Non-current Assets\n\nFrom the initial entries at 2023-12-31:\n\n- Initial Fixed Assets = 8,000,000.0\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Additions of non-current assets during the period\n\nLook for entries related to fixed asset purchases:\n\nEntries with type or asset_name indicating fixed assets or non-current assets:\n\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 928,991.43 (Central AC)\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 1,567,146.49 (Renovation Project)\n\nNote: These two entries are on 2023-12-31 (initial) but not part of the initial fixed asset total? According to the initial fixed assets recorded at 8,000,000.0, these could be additions right on the date or included. Since the initial fixed assets are from the line with id=Initial20231231001, 8,000,000.0 might represent prior fixed assets before adding these purchases.\n\nHowever, both these FixedAsset20231231001 purchase entries have date and recorded_date = 2023-12-31, so they should be part of the initial fixed assets total. Since initial fixed assets are given as a lump sum 8,000,000.0, presumably these purchases are included or adjustments on that date. To be conservative, assume the initial fixed assets are 8,000,000.0 including these purchases since they're initial date.\n\nNo other fixed asset purchases with date after 2023-12-31 in this data snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Depreciation during period\n\nSum up depreciation amounts from depreciation records after 2023-12-31:\n\n- Depreciation20240101001: 45,740.94\n- Depreciation20240201002: 71,799.68\n\nTotal depreciation = 45,740.94 + 71,799.68 = 117,540.62\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculate ending value of non-current assets\n\nInitial fixed assets: 8,000,000.00  \nAdd fixed asset purchases after 2023-12-31: None found.\n\nSubtract depreciation: 117,540.62\n\nEnding value = 8,000,000.00 - 117,540.62 = 7,882,459.38\n\n---\n\n### Final result:\n\n- Total Non-current Assets Initial Value: 8,000,000.00\n- Total Non-current Assets End Value: 7,882,459.38\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"7882459.38\"}}\n```",
