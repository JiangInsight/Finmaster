                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to identify two specific line items and their values from the financial statements:\n\n1. Costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services.\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\nWe must extract these from the statements and group them by financial statement in the following order:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services\n\nThe typical accounts related to costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services include selling expenses and administrative expenses (sometimes combined under operating expenses). These show up mainly in the Income Statement.\n\nFrom the **Income Statement** table:\n- Administrative Expenses: 10,432.67\n- Selling Expenses: 9,828.84\n\nThese represent expenses to deliver goods and services and secure orders. Usually, Selling Expenses are more closely related to costs for securing orders and delivering goods/services.\n\nGiven the previous example used \"Selling Expenses\" as value1 (493,854.67), we will follow the same logic here.\n\nSo value1 = Selling Expenses = 9,828.84\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets\n\nThis is found in the **Cash Flow Statement** under cash flow from investing activities, usually labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" or \"Capital Expenditures\".\n\nFrom the **Cash Flow Statement**:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 2,496,137.92\n\nSo value2 = Purchase of Fixed Assets = 2,496,137.92\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Values from the statements in the required order\n\n- Balance Sheet: No relevant line items specified for these two values.\n- Income Statement: Selling Expenses (cost to secure and deliver) = 9,828.84\n- Cash Flow Statement: Purchase of Fixed Assets (cash payment for long-term assets) = 2,496,137.92\n\n---\n\n### Final answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"9828.84\", \"value2\": \"2496137.92\"}}\n```",
