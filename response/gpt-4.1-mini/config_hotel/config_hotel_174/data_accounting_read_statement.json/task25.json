But the example solution only provided the value of selling expenses.\n\nIn this context, the best match is the \"Selling Expenses\" since it's the cost incurred to secure customer orders, which is the focus in the example.\n\nThus the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"9828.84\"}}\n```\n\n# Final answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"9828.84\"}}\n```",
