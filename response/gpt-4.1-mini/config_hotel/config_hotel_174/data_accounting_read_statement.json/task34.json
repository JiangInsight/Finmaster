Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities  \n   - This would be \"Total Revenue\" (or equivalent total income line).\n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period  \n   - This matches \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole  \n   - This matches \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n\nFrom the given problem input:\n\n| Account                 | Amount    | Date       |\n|-------------------------|-----------|------------|\n| Main Business Revenue   | 791992.51 | 2024-02-03 |\n| Total Revenue           | 791992.51 | 2024-02-03 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold      | 504930.00 | 2024-02-03 |\n| Total Cost              | 504930.00 | 2024-02-03 |\n| Gross Profit            | 287062.51 | 2024-02-03 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 10432.67  | 2024-02-03 |\n| Selling Expenses        | 9828.84   | 2024-02-03 |\n| Depreciation            | 117540.62 | 2024-02-03 |\n| Financial Expenses      | 3193.59   | 2024-02-03 |\n| Total Expenses          | 140995.72 | 2024-02-03 |\n| Interest Income         | 5264.70   | 2024-02-03 |\n| Profit Before Tax       | 151331.49 | 2024-02-03 |\n| Tax Expense             | 39599.66  | 2024-02-03 |\n| Net Profit              | 111731.83 | 2024-02-03 |\n\nFollowing the original line item order in the problem statement:\n\n- Total income from ordinary activities = \"Total Revenue\" = 791992.51  \n- Carrying amount of inventories sold = \"Cost of Goods Sold\" = 504930.00  \n- Costs of general management and administration = \"Administrative Expenses\" = 10432.67  \n\nHence,\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"791992.51\", \"value2\": \"504930.00\", \"value3\": \"10432.67\"}}\n```\n",
