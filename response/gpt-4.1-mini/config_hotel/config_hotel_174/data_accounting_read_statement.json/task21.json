The core operating activities usually generate what is called \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Operating Revenue\".\n2. In the provided income statement, the line item relevant to this is:\n   - \"Main Business Revenue\" with the amount 791992.51.\n3. \"Total Revenue\" also equals 791992.51, which confirms that the main business revenue is the core operational income.\n\nTherefore, the value arising from core operating activities is **791992.51**.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"791992.51\"} }\n```",
