This amount reflects the cost of inventory that was sold during the period.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Inventory values are given in the balance sheet but they represent ending inventory amounts.\n2. Cost of Goods Sold in the income statement usually represents the carrying amount of inventory sold.\n3. In this problem, the income statement shows:\n   - Cost of Goods Sold = 504,930.00\n\nHence, the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is 504,930.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"504930.00\"} }\n```",
