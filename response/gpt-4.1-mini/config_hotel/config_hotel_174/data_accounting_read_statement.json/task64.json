This is typically represented by **\"Paid-in Capital\"**. The end amount is **16000000.00**.\n\n2. From the **Income Statement**, we need the profit or loss for the period before deducting tax expense. This is **\"Profit Before Tax\"**. The amount is **151331.49**.\n\n3. From the **Cash Flow Statement**, we need the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period. This typically corresponds to the increase in **\"Accounts Payable\"** in the cash flow from operating activities. The amount is given as **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: **3350120.00**.\n\nHence,\n\n- value1 (Paid-in Capital) = \"16000000.00\"\n- value2 (Profit Before Tax) = \"151331.49\"\n- value3 (Increase in Accounts Payable) = \"3350120.00\"\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"16000000.00\", \"value2\": \"151331.49\", \"value3\": \"3350120.00\"}}\n```",
