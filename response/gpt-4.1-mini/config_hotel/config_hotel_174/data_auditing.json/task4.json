In the full problem text, it is recorded as 8,000,000 which is consistent with invoice text, so no error there.\n- Hence, no correction needed.\n\nTherefore, no inconsistency actually exists in the provided problem entry, hence no fields to correct.\n\nAs task requires to identify inconsistencies, and none are found in the given problem, the output reflects no inconsistencies.\n\n# Summary\n\nNo inconsistencies or errors found for the problem entry given.",
