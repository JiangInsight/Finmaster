The relevant line items for liabilities settled within the operating cycle are usually \"Current Liabilities,\" which here are detailed as \"Total Current Liabilities.\"\n\n2. From the table:\n   - Initial value of Total Current Liabilities (at 2023-12-31) = 0.00\n   - End value of Total Current Liabilities (at 2024-02-04) = 3,376,304.04\n\n3. These values represent the total liabilities expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle at the two given dates.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3376304.04'}}\n```",
