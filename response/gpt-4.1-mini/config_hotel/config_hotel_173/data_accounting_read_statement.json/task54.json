The income statement lists:\n   - Cost of Goods Sold: 543,370.00\n   - Selling Expenses: 12,001.12\n   - Administrative Expenses: 16,566.53\n   - Depreciation: 96,479.34\n   - Financial Expenses: 4,532.17\n\n2. The costs to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services generally correspond to \"Selling Expenses\" because these expenses include advertising, sales commissions, distribution, and delivery costs.\n\n3. The value under \"Selling Expenses\" is 12,001.12.\n\nHence, the cost incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services to customers is 12,001.12.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '12001.12'}}\n```",
