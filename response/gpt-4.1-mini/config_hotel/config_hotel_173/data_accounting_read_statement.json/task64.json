                        "content": "Step 1: Identify the three required values:\n\n- The first is from the Balance Sheet: capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares → this corresponds to \"Paid-in Capital\".\n- The second is from the Income Statement: profit or loss for period before deducting tax expense → this corresponds to \"Profit Before Tax\".\n- The third is from the Balance Sheet (or Cash Flow Statement) the addition in amount owed for goods or services on credit → corresponds to \"Accounts Payable\" increase.\n\nStep 2: Extract these values from the problem data:\n\n- Balance Sheet → Paid-in Capital (capital contributed by shareholders):\n  - End_amount: 16000000.00\n\n- Income Statement → Profit Before Tax:\n  - Amount: 186506.07\n\n- Balance Sheet → Accounts Payable (addition in amount owed for goods purchased on credit):\n  - End_amount: 3333720.00\n\nThese are the values requested in the specified order grouped by financial statements:\n\n1. Balance Sheet:\n   - Paid-in Capital: 16000000.00\n   - Accounts Payable: 3333720.00\n\n2. Income Statement:\n   - Profit Before Tax: 186506.07\n\nBut per instructions, the order should be:\n\n- Balance Sheet: first \"capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares\" (Paid-in Capital), then the addition in amount owed for goods/services i.e. Accounts Payable.\n- Income Statement: profit or loss before tax → Profit Before Tax\n- Cash Flow Statement: The addition in amount owed is accounted in Balance Sheet here, so no value extracted from cash flow for this.\n\nThe question request:\n\n- Three line items and end value of profit before tax, addition in amount owed by the entity for goods/services on credit, and capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares.\n\n- Grouped by financial statement:\n\n  1. Balance Sheet (two values): capital contributed by shareholders (Paid-in Capital), addition in amount owed (Accounts Payable)\n  2. Income Statement (profit before tax)\n  3. Cash Flow Statement (none here as per problem data)\n\nBut the original example only lists one value per group:\n\nGiven the example shows:\n\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '-1373590.51', 'value3': '1590000.00'}}\n\nWhere:\n\n- value1 from Balance Sheet → Paid-in Capital\n- value2 from Income Statement → Profit Before Tax\n- value3 from Balance Sheet → Accounts Payable\n\nBecause the example referred:\n\n- value3 corresponds to addition in \"Accounts Payable\"\n\nHence order in the example corresponds to:\n\n1. Balance Sheet → capital contributed by shareholders → Paid-in Capital\n\n2. Income Statement → profit before tax\n\n3. Balance Sheet → addition in amount owed → Accounts Payable\n\nNo mention of Cash Flow Statement value.\n\nTherefore, our mapping is:\n\n- value1 = Paid-in Capital = 16000000.00\n\n- value2 = Profit Before Tax = 186506.07\n\n- value3 = Accounts Payable = 3333720.00\n\nFinal formatted answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"16000000.00\", \"value2\": \"186506.07\", \"value3\": \"3333720.00\"}}\n```",
