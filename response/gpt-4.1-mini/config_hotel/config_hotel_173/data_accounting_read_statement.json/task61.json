The cost incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services to customers.\n2. The cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\nWe have three financial statements: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify the cost related to securing customer orders and delivering goods/services.\n\nThis cost generally appears in the **Income Statement** under either **Selling Expenses** or **Administrative Expenses** (depending on company classification), but usually selling expenses relate to costs of securing orders and delivering goods.\n\nFrom the **Income Statement** provided:\n\n- Administrative Expenses: 16566.53\n- Selling Expenses: 12001.12\n\nBetween these two, \"Selling Expenses\" typically corresponds to costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods/services.\n\nThus, line item 1: **Selling Expenses = 12001.12**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify cash payments to acquire property, plant, equipment (PPE) and other long-term assets.\n\nThis value is typically found in the **Cash Flow Statement** under **Cash Flow from Investing Activities** as **Purchase of Fixed Assets** or similar.\n\nFrom the **Cash Flow Statement**, we see:\n\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 251793.02\n\nThus, line item 2: **Purchase of Fixed Assets = 251793.02**\n\n---\n\n### Final Step: Arrange them by financial statement order as requested:\n\n1. Balance Sheet: No relevant line items for these two particular costs.\n\n2. Income Statement: Selling Expenses = 12001.12\n\n3. Cash Flow Statement: Purchase of Fixed Assets = 251793.02\n\n---\n\n### Final JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"12001.12\", \"value2\": \"251793.02\"}}\n```",
