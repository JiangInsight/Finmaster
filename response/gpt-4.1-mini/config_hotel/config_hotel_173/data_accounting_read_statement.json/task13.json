Identify line items and values of total assets that are **not expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle**.\n\n2. Typically, these are **Non-current Assets** (e.g., Fixed Assets). Current Assets (like Cash, Bank Deposits, Receivables, Inventory) are expected to be realized or consumed in the ordinary operating cycle, so they are excluded.\n\n3. From the balance sheet provided:\n   - Total Non-current Assets:\n     - Initial: 8,000,000.00\n     - End: 8,155,313.68\n\n4. Therefore, the answer is the total non-current assets value initially and at the end.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"8155313.68\"}}\n```",
