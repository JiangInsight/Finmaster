We need to identify the \"income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities.\"  \n   - This is typically represented by revenue related to the main operations.\n   - The relevant line item here is \"Main Business Revenue,\" which equals 851679.79.\n\n2. We need to identify the \"carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\"  \n   - This is typically the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n   - The relevant line item here is \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" which equals 543370.00.\n\n3. Maintaining the original line item order, the first value is Main Business Revenue and the second value is Cost of Goods Sold.\n\nHence, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '851679.79', 'value2': '543370.00'} }\n```",
