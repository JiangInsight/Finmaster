This typically corresponds to the **Cash Flow from Investing Activities** section.\n\nIn the provided data:\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets** = 251,793.02 (positive amount, meaning cash outflow for acquisition)\n- **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities** = -251,793.02 (net cash outflow from investing activities)\n\nThere is only one direct line item related to acquisition/disposal of long-term assets:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets\n\nThere is no separate mention of interest or dividends received in investing activities in the input data.\n\nHence:\n- The total value = Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -251,793.02\n- The one sub-item is Purchase of Fixed Assets = 251,793.02\n\nNote: The sub-item value is positive as it represents a cash outflow (cash spent), but the net cash flow includes the direction (outflow shown negative).\n\n### Final JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-251793.02\", \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"251793.02\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-251793.02\", \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"251793.02\"}}\n```",
