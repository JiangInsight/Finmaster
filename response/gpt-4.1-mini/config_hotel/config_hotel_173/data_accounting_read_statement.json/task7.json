Accumulated Depreciation represents the total depreciation expense charged over time. Since the initial value is 0.00 and it increased to 96479.34, this suggests that depreciation expense for the period is 96479.34.\n\n- Retained Earnings started at 0.00 and increased to 143922.03. Retained Earnings after a period reflect net income minus dividends (expenses and revenues are closed into this account). However, Retained Earnings alone is insufficient to specify the expense amount.\n\nGiven the task is to identify an expense line item and value, the best specific expense figure visible is the increase in Accumulated Depreciation.\n\nSo:\n\n- Initial value: 0.00 (Accumulated Depreciation)\n\n- End value: 96479.34 (Accumulated Depreciation)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"96479.34\"}}\n```",
