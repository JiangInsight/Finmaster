The example solution only extracted the \"Selling Expenses\" value.\n\nGiven the example and instructions, and since the example solution returned only \"Selling Expenses\", I will follow the same pattern.\n\nTherefore, the \"value\" to extract is the Selling Expenses: 12001.12\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"12001.12\"}}\n```",
