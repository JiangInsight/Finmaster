However, the task requests the value of decrease, i.e., line item reflecting reduction in amounts owed.\n\nSince the line is \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with a negative value, this means there was an increase in accounts receivable balances, implying that the entity collected less than the credit sales or extended more credit.\n\nTherefore, the decrease in amounts owed to the entity is not reflected here (it would be represented by a positive number). However, the task is to identify and extract the specific line item and its value reflecting any decrease. The only relevant line is this one.\n\nHence, the value to extract is the line \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with the value -335967.05.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-335967.05'} }\n```",
