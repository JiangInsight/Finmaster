                        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate two values from the provided transactions data:\n\n1. **Interest Receivable Initial Value** — This is the amount of interest receivable recorded as of the initial balance date (i.e., 2023-12-31).\n2. **Interest Receivable End Value** — This is the cumulative amount of interest receivables recorded (unpaid) up to the end of the reporting period, including the initial balance plus all subsequent interest receivable transactions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify Interest Receivable Initial Value\n\nCheck for any transaction on or before 2023-12-31 (initial balance date) with type containing \"Interest Receivables\".  \n- In the given data, no interest receivable transaction occurs exactly on 2023-12-31 or before. The earliest Interest Receivables entry is dated 2024-01-01 (Interest20240101001).\n\nSince no interest receivable exists at initial balance (2023-12-31),  \n**Interest Receivable Initial Value = 0.00**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Interest Receivable End Value\n\nSum all the interest receivables listed in the data with type \"Interest Receivables.\" Only include interest transactions with unpaid status or that represent receivable amounts.\n\nLooking at the transactions:\n\n- All \"Interest Receivables\" transactions appear with various positive and some negative numbers.\n- The task example solution sums all interest receivable amounts from the data in a similar problem to get the end value.\n- We will sum all the \"amount\" (or recorded_amount) values of all transactions with type \"Interest Receivables\" for the current data.\n\nWe extract all \"Interest Receivables\" records and sum their amounts:\n\nInterest amounts (rounded to 8 decimals for accuracy) are:\n\n- 374.69  \n- 328.36728  \n- 328.36728  \n- 314.61678  \n- 314.61678  \n- 304.2109  \n- 304.2109  \n- 243.35332122  \n- 243.35332122  \n- 243.35332122  \n- 243.35332122  \n- 243.35332122  \n- 243.35332122  \n- 243.35332122  \n- 243.35332122  \n- 183.67882122  \n- 183.67882122  \n- 183.67882122  \n- 183.67882122  \n- 183.67882122  \n- 183.67882122  \n- 183.67882122  \n- 183.67882122  \n- 183.67882122  \n- 183.67882122  \n- 183.67882122  \n- 183.67882122  \n- 183.67882122  \n- 183.67882122  \n- 183.67882122  \n- 183.67882122  \n- 183.67882122  \n- 183.67882122  \n- 176.45202122  \n- 176.45202122  \n\nThese are all positive values only (no negative values visible in the problem data).\n\nLet's sum them:\n\nCount the occurrences:\n\n- 374.69 : 1  \n- 328.36728 : 2  \n- 314.61678 : 2  \n- 304.2109 : 2  \n- 243.35332122 : 8  \n- 183.67882122 : 16  \n- 176.45202122 : 2  \n\nCalculate sum step-wise:\n\n- 374.69  \n- + (328.36728 * 2) = 656.73456 → total = 1031.42456  \n- + (314.61678 * 2) = 629.23356 → total = 1660.65812  \n- + (304.2109 * 2) = 608.4218 → total = 2270.97992  \n- + (243.35332122 * 8) = 1946.82657 → total = 4217.80649  \n- + (183.67882122 * 16) = 2938.86114 → total = 7156.66763  \n- + (176.45202122 * 2) = 352.90404 → total = 7509.57167\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Consider possible double counting or date filter\n\nThe sum of ~7509.57 seems large for interest receivable amount - but the problem context suggests to consider only the periods as per the initial example (Jan 1 to some date)\n\nIn the interest example in the prompt, the \"Interest Receivable End Value\" was about 2672.87 for multiple entries with values ~300 and ~16, but fewer entries.\n\nHere the problem data extends until 2024-02-04.\n\nBecause we are asked for the balance sheet value, we consider all unpaid interest receivables recorded till end of the data period (latest date 2024-02-04).\n\nHence, the total interest receivables accumulated:\n\n**Interest Receivable End Value ≈ 7509.57**\n\n---\n\n### Final output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"7509.57\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\n- Initial interest receivable: none as per initial date -> 0.00  \n- Sum all interest receivable amounts for unpaid status (all seem unpaid) → ~7509.57\n\nThis satisfies the requirement of including both initial and final amounts.",
