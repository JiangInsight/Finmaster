Typically:\n\n- Cash outflows: Cash paid for purchase of fixed assets (capital expenditures).\n- Cash inflows: Cash received from sale of fixed assets or investments.\n\nFrom the data provided, we look specifically at transactions related to fixed assets purchase and sale.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Fixed Assets related transactions with payment status \"Paid\" and relevant payment methods (cash or bank transfer):\n\n- There is one clear fixed asset purchase record:\n\n| id                  | type                  | date       | amount    | payment/receipt_status | payment_method | asset_name        | asset_type       |\n|---------------------|-----------------------|------------|-----------|------------------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| FixedAsset20231231001| Fixed Assets Purchase  | 2023-12-31 | 251,793.02| Paid                   | Bank Transfer  | Kitchen Equipment4 | Kitchen Equipment |\n\nNo fixed asset sale transactions are given in data.\n\n### Step 2: Sum cash paid for investing activities (primarily fixed assets purchases paid)\n\n- Total cash outflow = 251,793.02\n- No cash inflow from sales of fixed assets is noted.\n\n### Step 3: Compute Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n\nNet cash flow = Cash inflows from investing activities - Cash outflows from investing activities\n\n= 0 - 251,793.02\n\n= -251,793.02\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-251793.02\"}}\n```\n",
