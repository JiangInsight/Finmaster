These are typically \"non-current assets\", such as fixed assets (property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, etc.), net of accumulated depreciation.\n\nFrom the provided balance sheet:\n\nNon-current assets:\n- Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.00 (Initial), 8,000,000.00 (End)\n- Accumulated Depreciation: 0.00 (Initial), 91,488.35 (End)\n- Therefore, Net Fixed Assets = Fixed Assets - Accumulated Depreciation\n  - Initial: 8,000,000.00 - 0.00 = 8,000,000.00\n  - End: 8,000,000.00 - 91,488.35 = 7,908,511.65\n\nAlso notice in the balance sheet, \"Total Non-current Assets\" is already calculated:\n- Total Non-current Assets: 8,000,000.00 (Initial), 7,908,511.65 (End)\n\nSo, THESE are the asset values that are not expected to be realised or intended for sale/consumption in the normal operating cycle.\n\nFinal answer in required format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '7908511.65'} }\n```",
