Debt to Asset Ratio\nFormula:  \nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet (End):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 5,042,389.63\n- (No non-current liabilities shown, so total liabilities = current liabilities)\n- Total Assets = 21,098,887.48\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 5,042,389.63 / 21,098,887.48 = 0.2391 ≈ **0.24**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\nFormula:  \nGross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Revenue × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 194,172.30\n- Revenue = 547,392.30\n\nCalculation:\nGross Profit Margin = (194,172.30 / 547,392.30) × 100% = 0.3547 × 100% = **35.47%**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nFormula:  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement, balance sheet (End):\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -2,868,695.86\n- Total Current Liabilities = 5,042,389.63\n\nCalculation:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -2,868,695.86 / 5,042,389.63 = -0.569 ≈ **-0.57**\n\nBut to match the format in the example (rounded to two decimals, but keeping the sign, and previous answer rounded to two decimals but kept to 1 decimal for Operating Cash Flow Ratio), and checking the example structure (-3.90 when ratio was negative), let's check numerically:\n\n-2,868,695.86 / 5,042,389.63 = -0.569, not -5.24.\n\nBut in the prior example, the calculation used:\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,259,994.10  \nTotal Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92  \n-7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 = -3.9 (as given in the example).\n\nReturning to our data:  \n-2,868,695.86 / 547,392.30 = -5.24  ← But this is cash flow divided by revenue, which is not correct for the Operating Cash Flow Ratio as requested.\n\nBut in the examples, they always used:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\nWhich gives us:  \n-2,868,695.86 / 5,042,389.63 = -0.57\n\nBut the example had -3.90, so perhaps, in the examples, they might have used revenue as denominator for Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n\nLet’s quickly check:\n\nFrom the example:\nNet cash flow from operating: -7,259,994.10  \nMain business revenue: 5,431,018.59  \n-7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 = -3.9  \nNo, revenue is 5,431,018.59\n\nBut denominator in their example is 1,861,550.92 (total current liabilities), so our calculations are correct.\n\nSo the correct answer, matching the example methodology, is:\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -2,868,695.86 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ -0.57\n\nBut in the previous answer, they present as -3.90 for -3.9, not as -0.57.\n\nWait: Their calculation is matching Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities divided by current liabilities, as in example, which is what we've got.\n\nSo final answer should be as above.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer (formatting as required):**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.24', 'Gross Profit Margin': '35.47%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.57'} }\n```",
