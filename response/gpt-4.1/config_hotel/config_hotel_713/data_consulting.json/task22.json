Quick Ratio\n\nQuick Ratio = (Cash and Equivalents + Short-term Investments + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities  \nNote: Do NOT include Inventories.\n\nBased on the balance sheet (2024-02-05):\n\n- Cash on Hand: 2,179,154.14\n- Bank Deposits: 2,952,150.00\n- Interest Receivable: 9,881.70\n- Accounts Receivable: 200,359.99\n- Inventories: 7,848,830.00 (excluded)\n- Total Current Liabilities: 5,042,389.63\n\n**Quick Assets:**\n- Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits = 2,179,154.14 + 2,952,150.00 = 5,131,304.14\n- Interest Receivable = 9,881.70\n- Accounts Receivable = 200,359.99\n\nSum Quick Assets = 5,131,304.14 + 9,881.70 + 200,359.99 = 5,341,545.83\n\nQuick Ratio = 5,341,545.83 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ 1.06\n\nBut, typically, interest receivable is considered if it's very liquid; some conventions only use (Cash + Bank + Accounts Receivable). Even so:\n\nIf we do (Cash + Bank + Accounts Receivable):\n- 2,179,154.14 + 2,952,150.00 + 200,359.99 = 5,331,664.13\n\n5,331,664.13 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ 1.06\n\nBut let's cross-compare with your prior example: there, only cash, bank, interest receivable and AR were included for a quick ratio.\n\n**So the correct Quick Ratio = (Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities  \n= (2,179,154.14 + 2,952,150.00 + 9,881.70 + 200,359.99) / 5,042,389.63  \n= 5,341,545.83 / 5,042,389.63 = 1.06**\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\nNet Profit Margin = Net Profit / Total Revenue × 100%\n\nNet Profit: 56,497.85  \nTotal Revenue: 547,392.30  \nNet Profit Margin = 56,497.85 / 547,392.30 × 100% ≈ 10.32%\n\n---\n\n### Final JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Quick Ratio\": \"1.06\", \"Net Profit Margin\": \"10.32%\"}}\n```",
