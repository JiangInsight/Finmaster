                        "content": "```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.24\",\n  \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-0.57\",\n  \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.57\",\n  \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.31\"\n}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio**\n\nFormula:  \n**ART = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable**\n\n- Net Credit Sales = Main Business Revenue = 547,392.30\n- Accounts Receivable at Beg = 0.00  \n- Accounts Receivable at End = 200,359.99  \n- Average = (0.00 + 200,359.99) / 2 = 100,179.995\n\n**ART = 547,392.30 / 100,179.995 ≈ 5.47**\n\n**However**, as in your example, you used Ending AR for the first period when Beginning was 0. To keep analysis consistent:\n\n**ART = Net Sales / Ending AR = 547,392.30 / 200,359.99 ≈ 2.73**\n\nBut, typically, we use the average. Rounding to two decimals:\n\n**ART = 5.47**\n\nBut for consistency with your sample solution (which used average between 0 and period end):\n\nSo, **ART = 547,392.30 / 100,179.995 ≈ 5.47**\n\nBut in your example, with AR End = 2,429,482.13, Main Business Revenue = 5,431,018.59, ART ≈ 2.24. But you gave 4.47, matching Revenue/Average AR. So, let's follow the exact calculation:\n\nSample:  \nRevenue = 5,431,018.59  \nAvg AR = (0+2,429,482.13)/2 = 1,214,741.07  \n5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.07 = 4.47 (matches your solution).\n\nSo, for our case:  \nAR Avg = (0+200,359.99)/2 = 100,179.995  \nART = 547,392.30 / 100,179.995 = **5.47**\n\nBut you wrote 3.24 in the \"final\" answer - let's double check:\nIf we use (begin AR + end AR)/2 = (0+200,359.99)/2 = 100,180  \nNet sales/avg AR: 547,392.30 / 100,180 = **5.47**\n\nSo, matching your method, answer is **5.47**\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**\n\nFormula:  \n**Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities**\n\n- Operating Cash Flow = -2,868,695.86  \n- Current Liabilities = 5,042,389.63  \n\n**-2,868,695.86 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ -0.57**\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio**\n\nThis is the same as above (sometimes written both ways).\n\n**Answer: -0.57**\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Total Asset Turnover Ratio**\n\nFormula:  \n**Total Asset Turnover = Net Sales / Average Total Assets**\n\n- Net Sales = Main Business Revenue = 547,392.30  \n- Average Total Assets = (16,000,000.00 + 21,098,887.48) / 2  \n= 18,549,443.74\n\n**547,392.30 / 18,549,443.74 ≈ 0.03**\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Debt to Equity Ratio**\n\nFormula:  \n**Debt to Equity = Total Liabilities / Total Equity**\n\nAs of end period:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 5,042,389.63  \n  (No long-term liabilities given, just current)\n- Total Equity = 16,056,497.85\n\n**5,042,389.63 / 16,056,497.85 ≈ 0.314**\n\nRounded to two decimals: **0.31**\n\n---\n\n### Final Solution\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"5.47\",\n  \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-0.57\",\n  \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.57\",\n  \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.31\"\n}}\n```",
