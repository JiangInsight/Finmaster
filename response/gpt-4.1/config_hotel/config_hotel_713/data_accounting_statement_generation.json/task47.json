                        "content": "Let's break down the transactions step by step, focusing only on those that affect cash and cash equivalents. We'll sum up cash inflows and outflows to get the ending balance.\n\n### 1. **Initial Balances**\n- Initial cash deposit: **3,000,000.00**\n- Initial bank deposit: **5,000,000.00**\n\n**Total initial cash & cash equivalents:**  \n= 3,000,000 + 5,000,000  \n= **8,000,000.00**\n\n### 2. **Cash Outflows**\nLook for transactions with **Paid** status and **payment_method** as \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\". Purchases and expenses with \"Paid\" status involve outflow. Ignore those with \"Unpaid\" and account payables/receivables.\n\n#### **Purchases - Paid, Cash**\n- Purchase20231231003: Cash, 171,600.00\n- Purchase20231231007: Cash, 206,000.00\n- Purchase20231231012: Cash, 427,500.00\n- Purchase20231231021: Cash, 334,080.00\n  - Subtotal: 171,600 + 206,000 + 427,500 + 334,080 = **1,139,180.00**\n\n#### **Purchases - Paid, Bank Transfer**\n- Purchase20231231002: Bank Transfer, 54,950.00\n- Purchase20231231004: Bank Transfer, 67,900.00\n- Purchase20231231005: Bank Transfer, 545,000.00\n- Purchase20231231010: Bank Transfer, 1,380,000.00\n  - Subtotal: 54,950 + 67,900 + 545,000 + 1,380,000 = **2,047,850.00**\n\n#### **Other Paid Purchases**\n- Purchase20231231006: Not Paid (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231008: Not Paid\n- Purchase20231231009: Not Paid\n- Purchase20231231011: Not Paid\n- Purchase20231231013: Not Paid\n- Purchase20231231014: Not Paid\n- Purchase20231231015: Not Paid\n- Purchase20231231016: Not Paid\n- Purchase20231231017: Not Paid\n- Purchase20231231018: Not Paid\n- Purchase20231231019: Not Paid\n- Purchase20231231020: Not Paid\n- Purchase20231231022: Not Paid\n  - So we only add cash outflows above.\n\n#### **Expenses (All with Paid and Cash)**\nSum all \"Expense\" transactions with \"Paid\" status (all used Cash as method by reviewing the data).\n\n##### Administrative Expenses (Cash)\nAdd all as per data. Let's summarize:\n\n- Expense20240101001: 420.61\n- Expense20240115001: 771.36\n- Expense20240120001: 750.83\n- Expense20240112001: 631.59\n- Expense20240113001: 846.84\n- Expense20240106001:

Expense20240129001: 228.46\n- Expense20240130001: 123.24\n- Expense20240201001: 231.23\n- Expense20240202001: 857.74\n\nSubtotal (adding up all admin expenses):\n\n= 420.61 + 771.36 + 750.83 + 631.59 + 846.84 + 579.58 + 151.61 + 320.56 + 987.99 + 405.22 + 228.46 + 123.24 + 231.23 + 405.22 + 846.84 + 857.74  \nBut note that some costs above repeat because we do not have all in order, so in this step-by-step, I'll sum each group separately.\n\nLet's instead use a more systematic approach:\n\n#### All Expenses (Cash Outflows)\n**Step 1: Collect all expense amounts with Paid & Cash**\n\nFrom the table, these are:\n- Expense20240101001 | Administrative Expenses | 420.61 | Paid | Cash\n- Expense20240101001 | Sales Expenses | 912.25 | Paid | Cash\n- Expense20240102001 | Sales Expenses |

467.46 = 5927.84  \n10) 5927.84 + 579.58 = 6507.42\n\n+816.38 = 7323.80  \n+832.1 = 8155.90  \n+100.6 = 8256.50  \n+531.58 = 8788.08  \n+400.21 = 9188.29  \n+631.59 = 9819.88  \n+846.84 = 10666.72  \n+609.3 = 11276.02  \n+771.36 = 12047.38  \n+252.96 = 12300.34  \n+589.17 = 12889.51  \n+495.8 = 13385.31  \n+273.94 = 13659.25  \n+472.82 = 14132.07  \n+156.67 = 14288.74  \n+750.83 = 15039.57  \n+151.61 = 15191.18  \n+320.56 = 15511.74  \n+397.63 = 15909.37  \n+128.65 = 16038.02  \n+987.99 = 17026.01  \n+405.22 = 17431.23  \n+463.68 = 17894.91  \n+790.94 = 18685.85  \n+438.39 = 19124.24  \n+971.17 = 20095.41  \n+593.98 = 20689.39  \n+228.46 = 20917.85  \n+212.96 = 21130.81  \n+123.24 = 21254.05  \n+864.48 = 22118.53  \n+231.23 = 22349.76  \n+531.77 = 22881.53  \n+857.74 = 23739.27  \n+578.63 = 24317.90  \n+641.78 = 24959.68  \n+703.14 = 25662.82  \n+991.65 = 26654.47\n\nSo, the total for expenses (Paid, Cash) is **26,654.47**\n\nBut this appears too small, so let's double-check if the numbers are correct, perhaps there are missing zeros (from the context, sales, purchases run thousands and hundreds of thousands).\n\n**Wait: Reviewing the data, most expenses are in the hundreds, purchases in thousands or hundred thousands!**\n\nSo perhaps we need to re-calculate the major cash outflows *purchases*.\n\n#### **Total Bank Cash Purchases (Paid)**\n| Paid, Cash |\n- Purchase20231231003: 171600.00\n- Purchase20231231007: 206000.00\n- Purchase20231231012: 427500.00\n- Purchase20231231021: 334080.00\n\nAdd:\n\n171600 + 206000 = 377600  \n+ 427500 = 805100  \n+ 334080 = 1,139,180\n\n| Paid, Bank Transfer |\n- Purchase20231231002: 54950.00\n- Purchase20231231004: 67900.00\n- Purchase20231231005: 545000.00\n- Purchase20231231010: 1,380,000.00\n\n54,950 + 67,900 = 122,850  \n+ 545,000 = 667,850  \n+ 1,380,000 = 2,047,850\n\nTotal purchases (cash + bank transfer) = 1,139,180 + 2,047,850 = **3,187,030**\n\n#### **Expenses total so far** (from earlier result): 26,654.47  \nThat remains low. But on review, all expense amounts are in hundreds, and they might really sum to about 27,000.\n\n### 3. **Cash Inflows**\nAll **sales** with \"Paid\" and method Cash.
