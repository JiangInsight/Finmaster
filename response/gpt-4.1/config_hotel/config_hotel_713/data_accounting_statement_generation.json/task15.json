Understanding “Total Liabilities” in the Given Transaction Data\n\n- **Total Liabilities** = Sum of all company debts and obligations to outside parties as of the balance sheet date.\n- In this data, the only liabilities are **accounts payable** and other clear unpaid payables (e.g., \"Unpaid\" status on purchases, which generally means they are still owed, i.e., outstanding accounts payable).\n- **Interest Receivables** and **Account Receivables** are ASSETS, not liabilities, so they must NOT be included.\n- **Paid** purchases have been paid (no liability), while **Unpaid** purchases create \"accounts payable\" and so are counted as liabilities.\n- **Initial Liabilities:** Are there any? Check initial lines.\n- **End Liabilities:** Sum all unpaid purchases (accounts payable) as of the last date in the data set.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Extract Initial Liabilities\n\nLooking at the initial balances:\n\n| id                   | type           | amount    |\n|----------------------|----------------|-----------|\n| Initial20231231001   | Cash deposit   | 3,000,000 |\n| Initial20231231001   | Bank deposit   | 5,000,000 |\n| Initial20231231001   | Fixed Assets   | 8,000,000 |\n\n- No \"initial\" payable or loan accounts. \n**So, initial total liabilities = 0.00**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Extract All Outstanding Liabilities at the End\n\nGo through all **Purchase** lines (plus any others that have \"Unpaid\" & are actually liabilities):\n\nOnly include records with payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\".\nIgnore \"Interest Receivables\" and \"Account Receivables\" (they are assets).\n\n### Extract all \"Unpaid\" Purchases’ (i.e., accounts payable) amounts:\n\n| id                  | type      | amount    | payment/receipt_status | Comments         |\n|---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------|------------------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | Purchase  | 72,100    | Unpaid                | Ok               |\n| Purchase20231231006 | Purchase  | 1,380,000 | Unpaid                | Ok               |\n| Purchase20231231008 | Purchase  | 244,500   | Unpaid                | Ok               |\n| Purchase20231231009 | Purchase  | 16,650    | Unpaid                | Ok               |\n| Purchase20231231011 | Purchase  | 35,850    | Unpaid                | Ok               |\n| Purchase20231231013 | Purchase  | 454,000   | Unpaid                | Ok               |\n| Purchase20231231014 | Purchase  | 208,560   | Unpaid                | Ok               |\n| Purchase20231231015 | Purchase  | 121,440   | Unpaid                | Ok               |\n| Purchase20231231016 | Purchase  | 154,500   | Unpaid                | Ok               |\n| Purchase20231231018 | Purchase  | 30,300    | Unpaid                | Ok               |\n| Purchase20231231019 | Purchase  | 400,320   | Unpaid                | Ok               |\n| Purchase20231231020 | Purchase  | 616,320   | Unpaid                | Ok               |\n| Purchase20231231022 | Purchase  | 852,480   | Unpaid                | Ok               |\n\n#### Subtotal the above:\n\nNow, let's sum all \"Unpaid\" purchase amounts:\n\n- 72,100\n- 1,380,000\n- 244,500\n- 16,650\n- 35,850\n- 454,000\n- 208,560\n- 121,440\n- 154,500\n- 30,300\n- 400,320\n- 616,320\n- 852,480\n\nLet's calculate (add one at a time for accuracy):\n\n1. 72,100 + 1,380,000 = 1,452,100\n2. + 244,500 = 1,696,600\n3. + 16,650 = 1,713,250\n4. + 35,850 = 1,749,100\n5. + 454,000 = 2,203,100\n6. + 208,560 = 2,411,660\n7. + 121,440 = 2,533,100\n8. + 154,500 = 2,687,600\n9. + 30,300 = 2,717,900\n10. + 400,320 = 3,118,220\n11. + 616,320 = 3,734,540\n12. + 852,480 = 4,587,020\n\n**Total = 4,587,020**\n\n---\n\n## 4. Are there other liability transactions? (Unpaid Expense? Loans?
