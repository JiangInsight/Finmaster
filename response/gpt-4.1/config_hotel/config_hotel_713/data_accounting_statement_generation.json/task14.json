What are Current Liabilities?\n- **Current Liabilities** in the balance sheet typically include short-term borrowings, accounts payable (unpaid purchase amounts from suppliers), salaries payable, taxes payable, accrued expenses, etc.\n- In this dataset, \"Unpaid\" Purchases (*payment/receipt_status = Unpaid* and *payment_method* = \"Account Payable\") are Accounts Payable, which are the main current liabilities here.\n- The **Initial Balance Sheet** only contains cash, bank, and fixed assets - all asset side, no liabilities.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Stepwise Calculation\n\n#### **A. Initial Current Liabilities (at 2023-12-31):**\n- Scan \"Initial...\" entries. **None** mention liabilities, so initial current liabilities are **0.00**.\n\n#### **B. Current Liabilities at End**\n\nGo through all rows, sum up the *amount* for all **Unpaid Purchases** (*type=Purchase*, *payment/receipt_status=Unpaid*, and *payment_method=Account Payable*).\n\n- **(i) List all Purchases with Unpaid/Account Payable:**\n\n| id                 | amount    | payment/receipt_status | payment_method     |\n|---------------------|-----------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | 72100.0   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231006 | 1380000.0 | Unpaid                 | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231008 | 244500.0  | Unpaid                 | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231009 | 16650.0   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231011 | 35850.0   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231013 | 454000.0  | Unpaid                 | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231014 | 208560.0  | Unpaid                 | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231015 | 121440.0  | Unpaid                 | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231016 | 154500.0  | Unpaid                 | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231017 | 428000.0  | Unpaid                 | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231018 | 30300.0   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231019 | 400320.0  | Unpaid                 | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231020 | 616320.0  | Unpaid                 | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231022 | 852480.0  | Unpaid                 | Account Payable    |\n\n- **(ii) Sum up all unpaid purchases:**\n\nLet's add step by step:\n\n- 72100.0   (Purchase20231231001)\n-+1380000.0 (Purchase20231231006) = 1452100.0\n-+244500.0  (Purchase20231231008) = 1696600.0\n-+16650.0   (Purchase20231231009) = 1713250.0\n-+35850.0   (Purchase20231231011) = 1749100.0\n-+454000.0  (Purchase20231231013) = 2203100.0\n-+208560.0  (Purchase20231231014) = 2411660.0\n-+121440.0  (Purchase20231231015) = 2533100.0\n-+154500.0  (Purchase20231231016) = 2687600.0\n-+428000.0  (Purchase20231231017) = 3115600.0\n-+30300.0   (Purchase20231231018) = 3145900.0\n-+400320.0  (Purchase20231231019) = 3546220.0\n-+616320.0  (Purchase20231231020) = 4162540.0\n-+852480.0  (Purchase20231231022) = 5015020.0\n\nNow, did we miss any? Let's check all purchases above and ensure:\n- Purchase20231231004,  Purchase20231231005, Purchase20231231007, Purchase20231231010, Purchase20231231012, Purchase20231231021 all have Paid status, not Unpaid, or payment method is not Account Payable.\n\n**No missing entries.**\n\nNext, there’s also this entry:\n- Purchase20231231006 (ID exists) for 1,380,000.0 is already included.\n\nSo, the total sum so far adds up as follows:\n- 72100.0\n-+1380000.0 = 1452100.0\n-+244500.0 = 1696600.0\n-+16650.0 = 1713250.0\n-+35850.0 = 1749100.0\n-+454000.0 = 2203100.0\n-+208560.0 = 2411660.0\n-+121440.0 = 2533100.0\n-+154500.0 = 2687600.0\n-+428000.0 = 3115600.0\n-+30300.0 = 3145900.0\n-+400320.0 = 3546220.0\n-+616320.0 = 4162540.0\n-+852480.0 = 5015020.0\n\n- **Final Sum = 5,015,020.0**\n\n### But wait! There is **also** Purchase20231231006 for 1,380,000.0 (Unpaid/Account Payable); did I double-count?\n\nLet’s check:\n- Purchase20231231006 – Yes, it’s on the list. But is there a duplicate Purchase20231231006? No, only one.\n\n**No duplicates.**\n\n- Check the problem prompt against the sample answer in the example: The example only uses \"Unpaid\" purchases with \"Account Payable\" as current liabilities.\n---\n### **Accounts Payable at End (as of the latest date): 5,015,020.00**\n\n#### 3. Any other current liabilities?\n- \"Interest Receivables\" are assets, not liabilities.\n- Unpaid expense (accrued expenses)? All expenses are \"Paid.\"\n- No mention of short-term loans, taxes payable, etc.\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"5015020.00\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Recap:**  \n**Current liabilities at period start:** 0.00  \n**Current liabilities at period end:** 5,015,020.00 (sum of Unpaid purchases with Account Payable)  \n*Other entries in the table (assets, paid items, or receivables) do not affect current liabilities for this scenario.*",
