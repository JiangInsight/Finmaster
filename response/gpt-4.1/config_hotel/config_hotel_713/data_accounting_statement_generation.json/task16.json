                        "content": "Let's proceed step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Paid-in Capital\n\n**Paid-in capital** (also known as capital stock, owner's capital, contributed capital) is the total amount of funds provided by owners/shareholders in exchange for ownership interest (shares) in a company.\n- In most company accounting, this is usually indicated by initial cash, bank, and asset contributions made by the owners for shares at the companyâ€™s founding.\n- Unless more capital is contributed, or capital is withdrawn (which isn't shown in this data), the paid-in capital does not change with day-to-day business activities like sales, purchases, expenses, depreciation, or interest receivables.\n\n### Step 2: Locate Owned/Shareholder Contributions\n\nLook for \"Initial\" transactions, with the type being \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", or \"Fixed Assets\" (these directly show owner's injection of capital).\n\nFrom Problem Table:\n\n| id                | type          | date         | amount     |\n|-------------------|---------------|--------------|------------|\n| Initial20231231001| Cash deposit  | 2023-12-31   | 3,000,000  |\n| Initial20231231001| Bank deposit  | 2023-12-31   | 5,000,000  |\n| Initial20231231001| Fixed Assets  | 2023-12-31   | 8,000,000  |\n\nNo other \"Initial\" (owner equity) entries are present.\n\n### Step 3: Sum Initial Paid-in Capital\n\n- Cash:        3,000,000\n- Bank:        5,000,000\n- Fixed Assets:8,000,000\n\n**Total Paid-in Capital Initial Value = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 16,000,000**\n\n### Step 4: Check for Changes in Paid-in Capital\n\n- No additional \"Initial\" entries later.\n- No \"Capital withdrawals\" or \"Dividends paid\" or \"Return of capital\" items are shown.  \n- All other transactions are purchases, expenses, depreciation, sales, interest, etc. that affect profits and cash, but NOT the paid-in capital balance.\n\nThus, **Paid-in Capital End Value = 16,000,000**\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\", \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"16000000.00\"} }\n```\n",
