3000000.0 | 3000000.0 | ...\n  - This is the initial Cash on Hand.\n\n**Initial Cash on Hand = 3,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Find all cash inflows and outflows**\n#### **Cash Inflows to Cash on Hand**\n- Sales with \"receive_method\" or \"payment_method\" = \"Cash\" (i.e., customer pays cash)\n- Only the **amount actually received in Cash** is relevant; sometimes item shows total sale but also specifies units, but here if \"receive_method\" is Cash, then all amount is to cash, unless \"Paid\" and value per line.\n- Ignore other \"payment_method\" types (Bank Transfer, Account Payable etc).\n\n#### **Outflows from Cash on Hand**\n- Purchases/Expenses/Payments with \"payment_method\" = \"Cash\" reduce cash.\n- Bank Transfer: Only consider if cash leaves directly (i.e., \"payment_method\" = Cash, not \"Bank Transfer\").\n- Ignore Unpaid items (these don’t affect cash yet).\n\n---\n\n#### **Step A: Sum up all cash INCREASES (Entries with \"Cash\" received)**\n\nFind positive adjustments:\n- All \"Sale\" with receive_method = \"Cash\", sum \"amount\"\n- All \"Sale\" with payment_method=\"Cash\", sum \"amount\"\n- If both, just count once\n\nEntries for sales with cash:\n- | Sale | ... | receive_method = Cash | ... | amount = ... |\n- | Sale | ... | payment_method = Cash | ... | amount = ... |\n\n#### **Step B: Sum up all cash DECREASES (Outflows with \"Cash\" paid)**\n- All \"Expense\", \"Purchase\" with payment_method = \"Cash\" and Paid\n- Outflows: \"Expense\", \"Purchase\" lines with payment_method=\"Cash\" and \"Paid\"\n- Watch for possible double entries (unlikely here).\n\n---\n\n### 3. **List inflows (\"Cash In\")**\n\n#### **Sales (look for lines with `receive_method=Cash` or `payment_method=Cash`)**  \n\nGo through each sale from

\n+472.82 = 15724.77  \n+156.67 = 15881.44  \n+750.83 = 16632.27  \n+151.61 = 16783.88  \n\n**Batch 4:**  \n320.56 = 17104.44  \n+397.63 = 17502.07  \n+128.65 = 17630.72  \n+987.99 = 18618.71  \n+405.22 = 19023.93  \n+463.68 = 19487.61  \n+790.94 = 20278.55  \n+438.39 = 20716.94  \n+971.17 = 21688.11  \n+593.98 = 22282.09  \n\n**Batch 5:**  \n228.46 = 22510.55  \n+212.96 = 22723.51  \n+123.24 = 22846.75  \n+864.48 = 23711.23  \n+231.23 = 23942.46  \n+531.77 = 24474.23  \n+857.74 = 25331.97  \n+578.63 = 25910.60  \n+641.78 = 26552.38  \n+703.14 = 27255.52  \n\n**Batch 6:**  \n991.65 = 28247.17  \n\n**Sum of batches:**  \nFirst batch: 5927.84  \nSecond batch: 12259.42-5927.84 = **6331.58**  \nThird batch: 16783.88-12259.42 = **4524.46**  \nFourth batch: 22282.09-16783.88 = **5498.21**  \nFifth batch: 27255.52-22282.09 = **4973.43**  \nSixth batch: 28247.17-27255.52 = **991.65**  \n\nSo, sum:\n5927.84 + 6331.58 + 4524.46 + 5498.21 + 4973.43 + 991.65 =\n\nFirst three: 5927.84+6331.58=12259.42  \n+4524.46=16783.88  \n+5498.21=22282.09  \n+4973.43=27255.52  \n+991.65=28247.17  \n\nSo, sum as already calculated: 28247.17\n\n**Total Expenses Paid by Cash = 28,247.17**\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Total Cash Outflow**\n\nSum Expenses + Purchases\n\n**Purchases Total (as above):** 1,139,180.0  \n**Expenses Total:** 28,247.17  \n\nSo, **Total Outflow** = 1,139,180.0 + 28,247.17 = **1,167,427.17**\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Calculate ending cash balance**\n\n**Formula:**\nEnd Cash on Hand = Initial Cash + Total Inflows - Total Outflows\n\nSo,\nInitial Cash: 3,000,000.00\n+ Inflows: 347,032.31\n- Outflows: 1,167,427.17\n\nCalculate:\n\n3,000,000.00 + 347,032.31 = 3,347,032.31\n\n3,347,032.31 - 1,167,427.17 = **2,179,605.14**\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Final check: Did we miss any bank transfer, or is there any 'Cash to Bank Transfer'?**\n\nBank transfers out (i.e., cash removed from 'cash on hand' to bank):\nNo lines specifically state a cash to bank transfer!\n(If any, would appear as something like \"Cash to Bank Transfer\", and reduce cash.)\n\nNone are found in this problem. So the above covers all \"cash movement\".\n\n---\n\n### **Final Result**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\", \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"2179605.14\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nIf \"Purchase20231231007\" is 2023-12-31 Paid (should it be included if it's initial period?) -- Yes, since it's \"Paid\" (post-initial).  \nAll other calculations strictly followed the cash in/out rules per your provided data.\n\n---\n\n## **Answer**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\", \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"2179605.14\"} }\n```",
