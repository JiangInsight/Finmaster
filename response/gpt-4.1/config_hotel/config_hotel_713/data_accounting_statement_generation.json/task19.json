Find the **initial value** for \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\"\n\nFrom the data, the opening balances (\"Initial\") are as follows:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.00\n\nSum:\n```\n= 3,000,000.00\n+ 5,000,000.00\n+ 8,000,000.00\n= 16,000,000.00\n```\n**So, Initial Value: 16,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n## 2.

We'll do this by:\n\nA. **Calculate final assets**  \nB. **Calculate final liabilities**  \nC. **Owner's equity is balancing figure**  \nBut since the question specifically asks for \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\", it is actually just the total assets' value at period end (since that's always equal).\n\n### A.

Instead, let's suggest a more systemic approach since the question asks for total liabilities plus owner equity (which equals closing assets), and for assets, the only things that change are from sales, costs, purchases, expenses, receivables/payables and the like.\n\nBut since we see a large number of purchases were left unpaid (big accounts payable), and a growing amount of receivables, it's likely the closing total is:\n\n**Initial value + profits/loss in the period = Closing value**\n\nSo let's instead total the period profit (all sales profit - all expenses):\n\n#### Calculate Net Profit for Period:\n\nSum of all profit columns (from each sale).\n- For each sale row, sum the value in the \"profit\" column.\n\nLet's go through every sale row and sum the profit:\n\nWe'll extract all \"profit\" values from each Sale row (the ones with \"Paid\" or \"Unpaid\"); sum both.\n\n(In the example, Sale rows always have the column \"profit\" at the end).\n\n#### Let's Sum the \"profit\"

Expenses:\n\nSubtract all expenses (we previously summed):\n- Paid Expenses: 22,992.57\n\nBut the data contains only \"Paid\" expenses (all administrative, sales, financial) -- so we've already summed all expenses.\n\nSo, **Net Profit = 194,172.30 - 22,992.57 = 171,179.73**\n\nHowever, in accounting, profit is (Revenue - COGS - Other Expenses/Fee - Depreciation), but in the data, the \"profit\" column already accounts for cost_amount per sale (profit = revenue - cost per that sale, per \"profit\" column), so it's extra to subtract the COGS again. Depreciation is counted separately (increases expenses), and financial/admin/sales expenses are typically separate from COGS.\n\nAdditionally, we accounted for depreciation in the net book value of Fixed Assets.\n\nBut check: Are Expenses already subtracted in the profit column? Let's clarify:\n\nEach sale's \"profit\" is: Sale Amount minus Cost Amount per row.\nAll other \"Expenses\", are not part of \"profit\" per sale, so must be subtracted.\n\nAnd depreciation is already subtracted from Asset (not from profit), but in accounting, it's double-counted if we both subtract from asset and from profit -- so our approach is correct: profit as per \"profit\" column, subtract admin/sales/fin expenses, asset decreases due to depreciation, so closing assets = opening + net profit (above) - depreciation.\n\nBut our net profit is profit column sum - total expenses.\n\nBut, let's check if we accounted for depreciation expense twice. From the steps:\n- Fixed assets net book value is after depreciation.\n- Profit per sale is gross profit (revenue minus COGS only).\n- Expenses (admin/fin/sales) are not part of sale profit column, so need to be subtracted.\n\nTherefore, for closing assets:\n- Fixed assets: net after depreciation\n- Cash, Receivables, Inventory change based on transactions\n- Profit is gross profit per sales rows, less general/admin/other expenses (excluding depreciation, which is direct deduction from asset's value and not a cash outflow).\n\nSo, in fact, net profit is **sum of profit per sale - sum of all expenses (excl. depreciation)**\n\n---\n\n### **Calculate Total Assets at Closing**\n\nInstead, since balance sheet must balance, and the question seeks **Total Liabilities + Owner Equity (i.e. total resources)**, closing figure is:\n\n= Initial Value + Net profit for the period  \n= 16,000,000.00 + 171,179.73  \n= 16,171,179.73 (But must reduce by depreciation too, since assets drop)\n\nAlso, *since fixed assets are only reduced by depreciation, not by expense line*, and depreciation is not included in net profit above, we need to subtract depreciation once.\n\n- Depreciation (total): 45,746.47 + 45,741.88 = 91,488.35\n\nSo, closing assets = opening assets + net profit - depreciation  \n= 16,000,000.00 + 171,179.73 - 91,488.35  \n= 16,079,691.38\n\nBut this appears inconsistent with the examples which don't do this step, as depreciation is generally not an expenses line, and assets reduced by amount. Since the balance sheet always balances, let's accept:\n\n> Closing Total Liabilities and Owner Equity = net assets at period end, as computed\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\", \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"16079691.38\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n#### **Final statement**:\n- **Initial Value**: 16,000,000.00\n- **End Value**: 16,079,691.38\n\nIf you need a breakdown, just ask!",
