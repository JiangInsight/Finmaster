F002: 122,850\n\n  (No other paid purchases found, rest are Unpaid, thus increase Accounts Payable.)\n\n**Inventory Decreases** (COGS): Sum up all cost_amount from each sale.\n- Sum up all sales cost_amount column.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Cash and Bank Calculations**\n- **Outflows**:\n  - Purchases (any with payment method 'Cash' or 'Bank Transfer' and Paid)\n  - Expenses (Administrative, Sales, Financial) all Paid by Cash\n- **Inflows**:\n  - Cash sales\n- **Net Transfers**: None (bank/cash split totals unchanged overall)\n- Calculate as per cash outflow minus inflow.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Interest Receivable**\nSum of all Interest Receivable increases (from each interest line): For each line, sum up amount.\n(Total = sum of all positive \"Interest Receivables\" from Jan 1 to Feb 5.)\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Accounts Receivable**\nSum of all sale transactions marked as Unpaid (receipt_status = Unpaid, receive_method = Account Receivable)\n- Add all \"after_tax_amount\" for these sales.\n- Subtract any money received if customer pays later (none shown within data), otherwise just sum unpaid sales.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Accounts Payable**\nSum of all purchase transactions marked as Unpaid (payment_status = Unpaid, payment_method = Account Payable)\n- Add up all \"amount\" for all Unpaid Purchases.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Accumulated Depreciation**\nSum of all Depreciation lines for the period.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Retained Earnings**\n= Initial Retained Earnings\n+ Net Profit for the period\n\n**Net Profit** = Total Profit from all sales\n- All Expenses for the period\n- Depreciation\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Taxes Payable**\n= Sum of all tax_amounts from sales -
