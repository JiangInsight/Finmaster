For `Initial20231231001`, there are three entries: Cash deposit (3,000,000), Bank deposit (5,000,000) and Fixed Assets (8,000,000).  \n   - According to the invoice for `Initial20231231001`, on December 31, 2023, a Cash deposit was $3,000,000, a Bank deposit $5,000,000, and a Fixed Assets transaction. The invoice mentions \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Fixed Assets, totaling $5,000,000.00.\"  \n   - The \"Fixed Assets\" entry for `Initial20231231001` records amount as $8,000,000, while the invoice says $5,000,000.\n   - Therefore, there is an internal inconsistency: recorded_amount for Fixed Assets is $8,000,000.00, but per invoice should be $5,000,000.00.\n\n2. For `Sale20240110039`:\n   - The type is \"Sales Expenses\", but the invoice text says \"On January 10, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $554.42, totaling $554.42.\"\n   - Also, the \"recorded_unit_price\" is $654.39, whereas the invoice says $554.42.\n   - Therefore, two internal inconsistencies:\n     - The category/type should be \"Sale\", not \"Sales Expenses\".\n     - The recorded unit price is $654.39, but the invoice gives $554.42.\n\n**For all other rows:**  \n- The other entries are consistent between all relevant amount/unit price/quantity fields and invoice description, and their main fields (type, category, amounts, natures) match their invoice records or do not show a clear internal discrepancy needing correction.\n\n**Formatting:**\n- All unneeded fields left as blank (omitted) for clarity; unmentioned fields had no inconsistency.",
