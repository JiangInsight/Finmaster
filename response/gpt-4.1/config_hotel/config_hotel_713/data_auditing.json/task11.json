Initial20231231001 (Fixed Assets Amount Inconsistency)\nThere are three entries for ID `Initial20231231001`:\n- One for Cash deposit, amount $3,000,000.00\n- One for Bank deposit, amount $5,000,000.00\n- One for Fixed Assets, amount $8,000,000.00\n\nHowever, in the narrative (invoice) for the initial funds establishment, the typical logic is that cash deposit + bank deposit = total initial funding, which should match the Fixed Assets entry. But:\n- $3,000,000 (Cash) + $5,000,000 (Bank) = $8,000,000\n- Fixed Assets entry is also $8,000,000\n\nHowever, in THIS data, the Fixed Assets line is $8,000,000, which is not the 'increment' but rather the sum, and in the previous example set (see the sample), it is supposed to be $5,000,000, which matches one of the items.\n\n**But** in THIS record (contrast to the sample), both Cash and Bank add to the Fixed Assets number. So, should Fixed Assets be the sum or just one? The invoice for Fixed Assets states $8,000,000. So, the error is:  \nIn the Recorded amount for Fixed Assets, it is $8,000,000 but the sample has $5,000,000, and multiple records for the same ID with different amounts/types is itself an error.\n\nThus, **the issue is multiple records for the same ID with inconsistent categories/amounts**.\n\n#### Solution entry:\n- id: Initial20231231001\n- Original category: Fixed Assets\n- Recorded category: Fixed Assets\n- Original amount: 5000000.0 (as in the sample)\n- Recorded amount: 8000000.0\n\n---\n\n### 2. Expense20240118001 (Preparer Missing)\nThere are two entries for ID `Expense20240118001` on 2024-01-18:\n- 495.8, category: Sales Expenses, Preparer: [missing]\n- 273.94, category: Administrative Expenses, Preparer: Supervisor\n\nThe invoice for 495.8 says \"This transaction was prepared by Supervisor\", so Preparer should be Supervisor, not blank.\n\n#### Solution entry:\n- id: Expense20240118001\n- Original Preparer: Supervisor\n- Recorded Preparer: [empty string]\n\n---\n\n## Other entries review:\n\n- All other entries’ fields (quantity, price, amount, receipt/payment status, payment method, tax, profit, dates, categories, etc.) match their respective invoices/narrative or calculated totals.\n\n- No evidence of mis-categorization or mismatched status elsewhere; all units × price = total amount, cost, tax, and after-tax are consistent; the preparer/approver is present or matches across all other records.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \n- If only the above two inconsistencies were present (one with initial amount/category, one with missing preparer), the rest are consistent as per the provided data and cross-comparison with narratives/invoice descriptions.\n```",
