Initial20231231001 (Fixed Assets row)\n- There are three rows for Initial20231231001 with \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\". The sum of \"Cash deposit\" and \"Bank deposit\" is 8,000,000.00, which equals the amount on the \"Fixed Assets\" row.\n- According to the invoice: on December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Fixed Assets, totaling $8000000.00.\n- However, standard practice is that initial capital introduction is split into cash, bank, and fixed asset investment (these sum to the total initial capital). Here, \"Fixed Assets\" should more likely be categorized as \"Initial capital\" or \"Capital introduction\", not as an asset purchase.\n- Thus, there is a possible mis-categorization: the Fixed Assets row should be \"Initial capital\" or similar; \"Fixed Assets\" is misleading as a transaction type here.\n\n### 2. Purchase20231231007\n- According to the invoice: a purchase of 103 units at 2000 each, totaling 206,000.00.\n- Recorded: 113 units at 2000 each = 226,000.00.\n- The invoice type (\"Purchase\") is correct, but the recorded category is \"Sales Expenses\", which is inconsistent.\n- So recorded quantity and category are wrong.\n- The rest matches.\n---\n\nNo further internal inconsistencies were found in the other rows (quantities, prices, amounts, types, and statuses all agree between invoice and record). If you have more in this set, please clarify. If requesting any missing or additional corrections, clarify the specific row.",
