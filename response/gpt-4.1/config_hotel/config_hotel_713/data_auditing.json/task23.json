For `Initial20231231001`, there is an internal inconsistency in the total reported for \"Fixed Assets\" â€“ using the recorded \"Cash deposit\" (3,000,000) and \"Bank deposit\" (5,000,000), the correct \"Fixed Assets\" total (per invoice) should be 8,000,000.00, matching \"Recorded amount,\" so there is actually no error except possibly a formatting one.\n2. For `Sale20240106023`, according to the invoice, the transaction should have a date of \"2024-01-06\" and an amount of 8,819.56, but the record says \"2024-02-04\" and \"9,350.16\". This is an inconsistency.\n3. All other records in the sample data appear consistent when checked against the invoice narrative and math (unit price times quantity equals total amount; prep, payment method, status, and product name all match invoice description).\n\n**Note:**  \n- Where there is no discrepancy between invoice and record values, those fields are left as `null`.  \n- For records without an error, no output is provided (per the task instruction to only output for each inconsistency).\n- The first record is only highlighted if you wish to stress the form of the data and type consistency (though in this case there is no substantive error; the example only produces a formatting difference).\n",
