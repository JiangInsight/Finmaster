The cost amount for this transaction was $4500.00, with a tax amount of $307.67, leading to a total amount due of $5845.81. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- In the data row, the `recorded_type` is \"Sales Expenses\". This is inconsistent: this is clearly a Sale, not an expense.\n- The tax amount `recorded_tax_amount` is 6449.74, but the correct tax from invoice context and calculation is $307.67.\n- The rest of fields (quantity, price, receive_method, etc.) are correctly reflected.\n- The original category should be \"Sale\", not \"Sales Expenses\".\n- The original tax should be 307.67, not 6449.74.\n```",
