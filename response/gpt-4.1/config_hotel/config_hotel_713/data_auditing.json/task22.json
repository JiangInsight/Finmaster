All values are correct.\n- **Output included for completeness, though.**\n\n### 2. **Purchase20231231002**:\n- Table:\n  - recorded_date: 2024-01-24\n  - recorded_unit_price: 283.34\n- Invoice:\n  - Date: Dec 31, 2023\n  - Unit price: $350.00\n- Everything else (amount, quantity, supplier) matches.\n- Therefore, internal errors:\n  - Date should be 2023-12-31\n  - Unit price should be 350.0\n\n### All other records match their invoices and don't have internal errors (checked a variety of types: Purchase, Sale, Expense, etc.)\n\n**Note:** Where the table and the invoice match, we leave the field null. Only changed fields get values in both \"Original\" and \"Recorded\". This matches the provided sample output form.",
