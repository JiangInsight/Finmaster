For `Initial20231231001`, the cash deposit + bank deposit equals the fixed asset, possibly indicating repeated/overlapping initial entries with the same ID â€“ this might be a data normalization issue. No concrete field value conflicting within a single row (as there are 3 rows, but each is okay).\n2. For `Sale20240105019`, the invoice details indicate it's a Sale transaction, but the \"recorded\" row has type \"Depreciation,\" wrong date, price, amount, and tax. The correct entry should reflect the values from the invoice text.\n\n*If you want only the second case (where there is a clear field conflict in a single row), you may just include the `Sale20240105019` row, as in the example you provided.*",
