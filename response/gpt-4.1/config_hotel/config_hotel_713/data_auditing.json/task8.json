For each transaction, compare the calculated/expected values from invoice (deemed most reliable) to the recorded fields.\n2. For the transaction with id `Initial20231231001` and type `Fixed Assets`, the invoice states \"Fixed Assets, totaling $5,000,000.00\", but the recorded amount is $8,000,000.00. The invoice and the context (other initial capital rows for this id) show the correct Fixed Assets value should be $5,000,000.00. **Inconsistency found: recorded_amount is overstated.**\n3. For `Sale20240124080`, the invoice says: \"a Sale, consisting of 5.0 units at a unit price of $262.00, totaling $1,310.00\", but the recorded_amount is $1,559.41. Calculation: 5 * 262 = 1,310.00. So the invoice is correct, and the recorded_amount is overstated. **Inconsistency found: recorded_amount is wrong.**\n4. For all other rows, the values from invoice and recorded are matching or have no inconsistencies detectable based on the invoice as the source of truth.\n\n**Thus, only the above two entries have clear internal inconsistencies or errors, as computed per the task specification. All other rows have no discrepancies based on the \"invoice\" text and the recorded fields.**",
