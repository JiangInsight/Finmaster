The invoice for 'Fixed Assets' should match the sum of the inputs, but 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000, yet the separate Fixed Assets row records 8,000,000 also, causing double counting. The correct splitting should be: Cash deposit: 3,000,000; Bank deposit: 5,000,000; Fixed Assets: 8,000,000 (not an additional, but representing the total). Best estimate: keep Cash deposit = 3,000,000, Bank deposit = 5,000,000, Fixed Assets = 8,000,000 (total, as per invoice); or eliminate the extra 8,000,000 if double-counting is not intended.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240110038\",\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"4.0\",\n    \"Original quantity\": \"5.0\",\n    \"Recorded profit\": \"601.06\",\n    \"Original profit\": \"778.6\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Invoice says '5.0 units at a unit price of $505.72 (totaling $2,528.60) and paid by cash', but the row records 4.0 units, amount $2,022.88, and 'Unpaid'. So based on invoice, should be: quantity=5.0, amount=2,528.60, status=Paid, profit=778.60.\"\n  }\n]}\n```\nExplanations:  \n- The first item finds an ambiguity in how the initial capital and asset entries are splitâ€”either the 8,000,000 is intended as the sum or gets double-counted with the Cash/Bank split; the invoice suggests summing, so the current values may double-count the asset addition.  \n- The second item directly follows the example: invoice gives a quantity and payment status different from the table, so provides the correct fields from the reliable invoice details.\n\nNote: There are no other direct inconsistencies that can be proven from the given sample, unless more duplications or similar calculation errors are found (e.g., profit mismatches not covered in these entries above). For the rest of the rows, amounts and descriptions align.",
