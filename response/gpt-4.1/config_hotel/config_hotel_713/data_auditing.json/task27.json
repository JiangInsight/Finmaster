However, typically, the sum of Cash and Bank deposits should equal Fixed Assets if opening balances are used to introduce equity as assets; unless the business really started with 16,000,000 in total. If that's the case, this is not an inconsistency. If not, then the split is inconsistent. However, without more invoice narrative, we cannot be certain. (Not counted as a definite error but flagged.)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\",\n    \"Original amount\": \"1066.15\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"1256.91\",\n    \"Original price\": \"213.23\",\n    \"Recorded price\": \"203.03\",\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240127087\"\n  }\n]}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- There is only one definite internal inconsistency that matches the pattern given in your second example:  \n  - **Sale20240127087**: According to the invoice, this record is for a Sale (not \"Sales Expenses\") of 5 units at an original price of 213.23 (should total 1066.15), but the table records it as \"Sales Expenses\", with a recorded price of 203.03 and amount of 1256.91. All three fields are incorrect versus the reliable/invoice fields.\n\n- The first three rows for opening balances may seem inconsistent (adds up to 16M, not 8M), but this depends on the accounting context; sometimes opening equity = sum of cash + assets, sometimes not. There is not enough certainty to call this a robust error without further context.\n\n- All other records in the sample have consistent categories, amounts, unit prices, etc., with their invoice narratives.\n\n- Tax discrepancy and profit omissions are not present. The only needed correction is for the entry flagged above. \n\nIf you spot other similar invoice/category/amount/unit price mismatches, they should be reported the same way. Here, only \"Sale20240127087\" is a demonstrable error.",
