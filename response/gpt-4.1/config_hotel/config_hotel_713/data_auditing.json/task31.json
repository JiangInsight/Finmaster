Initial20231231001 (Fixed Assets)\n- Three lines have the same `id` (\"Initial20231231001\") with different types and amounts: \n  - Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n  - Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n  - Fixed Assets: **8,000,000.00 (recorded)**, but the **sum of cash+bank** is 8,000,000.00\n- **However, the invoice for \"Fixed Assets\" matches 5,000,000.00** (\"totaling $5,000,000.00\") and **not 8,000,000.00**. (Check the invoice sentence: \"an invoice was issued for a Fixed Assets, totaling $5,000,000.00.\") **Correction: The correct value for Fixed Assets should be 5,000,000.00, not 8,000,000.00.**\n- So, recorded value: 8,000,000.00, estimated correct value: 5,000,000.00\n\n### 2. Sale20240201103\n- Invoice: \"an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $463.40, totaling $463.40\"\n- But data table: \n  - recorded_quantity: 0.0 (should be 1.0)\n  - recorded_unit_price: 452.5 (should be 463.4)\n  - recorded_amount: 540.71 (should be 463.40)\n  - recorded_tax: 514.01 (should be 23.17)\n- Clear inconsistencies between standard invoice and recorded fields.\n\n### No other internal inconsistencies are detected in this sampled excerpt. If more are needed, please specify additional ambiguous records.\n```",
