The receive_method ... was cash, and this transaction was paid.\" This directly describes a SALE, not a depreciation.\n- The recorded_type in the table for `Sale20240124080` is wrongly set as \"Depreciation\" instead of \"Sale\".\n- The receive method is also inconsistent: invoice says \"Cash\", table says \"Account Receivable\".\n- All amounts and calculated fields (unit price, quantity, amount, tax, profit, etc.) match between invoice and fields.\n- Invoice is considered the original reliable source per instruction.\n- All other fields either match or are not available.\n- Therefore, original category: Sale, recorded category: Depreciation; original receive_method: Cash, recorded receive_method: Account Receivable.\n```",
