Initial20231231001 triple set (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets):\n\n- *Issue:* The \"Fixed Assets\" row amount does not match Cash+Bank.\n- Invoice text for \"Fixed Assets\" is for 8,000,000, but \"Cash deposit\" 3,000,000 + \"Bank deposit\" 5,000,000 = 8,000,000.\n- In your table, you list \"Fixed Assets\" as 8,000,000, but based on the pattern from your examples, the most reliable is the invoice/cash+bank relationship, which originally records 5,000,000; the error is that the recorded amount for Fixed Assets should be 8,000,000 (matching cash+bank/total), yet perhaps the other records show 5,000,000.\n- But in your table, \"Fixed Assets\" says 8,000,000, but the example had said the same id with 5,000,000 for Fixed Assets, which is why it is inconsistent. So the correct value from the invoice context is 8,000,000.\n\n### 2. Sale20240109032 (quantity/amount mismatch):\n\n- *Issue:* Invoice says: \"consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $2976.04, totaling $5952.08. ... The cost amount ... $4000.00, with a tax amount of $297.60, leading to a total amount due of $5654.48.\"\n- Yet in your problem, your table says \"recorded_quantity\": 1, \"recorded_amount\": 2976.04.\n- True value should be quantity=2.0, amount=5952.08 as per invoice.\n- This matches the error found in your sample risk_issues field and matches your prior solution structure.\n\n**There are other rows in your data with potential issue types (eg. none detected by invoice description), but these are actual, cross-row/cross-field mismatches found following the process and your sample logic.**\n\nIf you need further error checks, like against cost/unit price mismatches in other rows, let me know! Otherwise, these are the inconsistencies present per the supplied data.",
