A single transaction should not record three types with differing totals; invoice details suggest these should all add up to $8,000,000.00 (cash+bank=fixed assets). The internal data structure (e.g., asset splits) is inconsistent unless this is an initial capital entry decomposed into subtypes—yet the invoice doesn't support this decomposition. This is an internal consistency issue.\n\n2. **Sale20240107028** shows an invoice stating 1 unit x $7,813.36 = $7,813.36 sales. Yet the main record sets unit price to $8,811.46 and recorded amount to $9,037.28, which does not match invoice detail. The invoice is considered more reliable, so the correct price/amount/date should be as in the invoice.\n\nThere are no other computation or internal inconsistencies detected in the provided rows. Other entries all match the model \"quantity × unit price = amount\", cost, and tax in the line item vs. the invoice description. If any other mismatches are found (e.g., with payment/receipt status, preparer, or approver), they would also be listed similarly.",
