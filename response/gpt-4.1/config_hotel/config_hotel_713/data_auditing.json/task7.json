No output for this line except confirming.**\n\n2. **Inconsistency on Sale20240102004: receive_method**  \n   - According to the reliable field 'invoice' (\"The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"), the 'recorded_receive_method' should be \"Cash\".  \n   - However, in the data, 'recorded_receive_method' is \"Interest receivable\".  \n   - **Error found:** The receive method should be \"Cash\".  \n   - All other values match invoice.\n\n3. **All other entries match between record fields and the invoice description, including quantities (quantity * unit price = amount), payment status, payment method, product/service details, etc.**\n\n_Note: In the first block, there isn't actually a data inconsistency (it's standard for initial capital to be split into cash, bank, and fixed assets), so I've included it to show the reasoning step, but only the Sale20240102004 is an actual entry with a field error confirming the example schema that should be output. If you want only strict field errors, just report the Sale20240102004 entry, as below:_\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": [\n  {\n    \"Original category\": null,\n    \"Recorded category\": null,\n    \"Original date\": null,\n    \"Recorded date\": null,\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Original payment_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n    \"Original quantity\": null,\n    \"Recorded quantity\": null,\n    \"Original price\": null,\n    \"Recorded price\": null,\n    \"Original receive_method\": \"Cash\",\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Interest receivable\",\n    \"Original amount\": null,\n    \"Recorded amount\": null,\n    \"Original tax\": null,\n    \"Recorded tax\": null,\n    \"Original profit\": null,\n    \"Recorded profit\": null,\n    \"Original Preparer\": null,\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n    \"Original Approver\": null,\n    \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240102004\"\n  }\n]}\n```\nIf you want all systematic deviations, including the spelling difference between \"Account Receviable\" (as in many rows) versus \"Account Receivable\", you could enumerate all of those, but as per your example, only the receive_method inconsistency in Sale20240102004 is strictly present.",
