The payment_method ... was bank transfer, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- However, the recorded information is: type=`Depreciation`, date=`2024-01-25`, amount=`65800.0`, quantity=`188.0`, unit_price=`364.88`.\n- This disagrees with the invoice content.\n- All other entries match invoice exactly.\n- Thus, the only inconsistency in this table is for `Purchase20231231002`, as described above.\n```",
