Initial20231231001 (Inconsistency in Fixed Assets amount)\n- There are three lines for id=Initial20231231001, with Cash deposit (3,000,000), Bank deposit (5,000,000), and Fixed Assets (8,000,000). According to typical accounting entries for capital injection:\n    - Total capital injected should be split between cash, bank, and fixed asset, and their sum should match.\n    - The invoice says \"totaling $8,000,000.00\" for Fixed Assets, which matches the recorded_amount (8000000.0). However, without the sum of cash and bank deposits appearing as assets, this may be an inconsistency, but with only one line to record Fixed Assets as a single item, we note the absence of a \"recorded_amount\" in this row, even though the invoice has $8,000,000.\n    - Outputting as a potential field where \"Recorded amount\" is missing for clarity.\n\n#### 2. Sale20240105018 (Multiple field inconsistenciesâ€”a classic \"row mismatch\" per standardized invoice)\n- Invoice: \"On January 05, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 3.0 units at a unit price of $1513.25, totaling $4539.75. The cost amount for this transaction was $2640.00, with a tax amount of $226.99, leading to a total amount due of $4312.76. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- Table: recorded_type=Depreciation (instead of Sale), date=\"2024-01-09\" (should be 2024-01-05), quantity=2 (should be 3), unit_price=1306.91 (should be 1513.25), tax=4271.6 (should be 226.99).\n- This is a clear internal inconsistency. Record all relevant fields.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No other rows display clear internal conflicts between the invoice and the recorded fields; most other entries align (the purchases/sales/expenses/interest all match the invoice, after recalculating total = qty x price and checking status, method, etc.).\n\nIf you identify additional such inconsistencies, they're to be added following the above logic and JSON schema.
