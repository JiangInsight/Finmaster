So original status should be \"Paid\".\n   - **Recorded payment_method**: Not given, but received cash, so original is \"Cash\".\n   - **Original amount**: \"3569.46\"\n   - **Recorded amount**: \"4349.09\"\n   - **Original payment/receipt_status**: \"Paid\"\n   - **Recorded payment/receipt_status**: \"Unpaid\"\n   - **Original payment_method**: \"Cash\"\n   - **Recorded payment_method**: \"\"\n   - **Original receive_method**: \"Cash\"\n   - **Recorded receive_method**: \"\"\n   - **id**: \"Sale20240201102\"\n\n*All other transactions reviewed either match exactly, or the invoice agrees with row fields, so no further inconsistencies could be identified.*\n\n---\n\n**If more rows with similar discrepancies were listed, they would be included above in the same format.**",
