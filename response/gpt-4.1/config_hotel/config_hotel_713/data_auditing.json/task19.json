However, the sum of \"Cash deposit\" and \"Bank deposit\" equals $8,000,000.00 (3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0). This strongly suggests the \"Fixed Assets\" amount should be $5,000,000.0 **(from the provided example data pattern)**, not $8,000,000.0, which appears to be the sum of both cash and bank deposits rather than a third, independent entry.\n- In the provided example, the correct Fixed Assets value is 5,000,000.0. So the entry showing 8,000,000.0 is an error.\n- All other fields are consistent or non-applicable.\n- Therefore, the only inconsistency is in the \"Recorded amount\".",
