This implies the correct value is $8,000,000.00 according to the invoice, indicating the recorded field should match the invoice.\n\n2. **Sale20240118065**\n   - **Inconsistency**: The recorded unit price is shown as 3,113.77, but based on the invoice (\"consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $2604.73, totaling $2604.73\"), the unit price should be $2,604.73. The total recorded amount and the invoice both match ($2,604.73), meaning the recorded unit price is incorrectly entered as $3,113.77.\n   - **Correct Value**: The correct unit price is $2,604.73.\n\n**If only one answer is required as per the instruction, use either of the above in the field. For completeness, I've included both major inconsistencies found in your batch.**",
