The invoice states \"On January 08, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $233.96, totaling $467.92. The cost amount for this transaction was $300.00, with a tax amount of $23.40, leading to a total amount due of $444.52. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n2. The recorded entry has:\n   - recorded_type: \"Purchase\" (**should be \"Sale\"**)\n   - recorded_date: \"2024-01-31\" (**should be \"2024-01-08\"**)\n   - recorded_quantity: \"1.0\" (**should be \"2.0\"**)\n   - recorded_unit_price: \"268.99\" (**should be \"233.96\"**)\n   - recorded_amount: \"233.96\" (**should be \"467.92\"**)\n   - recorded_tax_amount: \"497.48\" (**should be \"23.40\"**)\n   - Other fields like payment/receipt_status, payment_method, and receive_method agree with the invoice and so remain as \"Paid\" and \"Cash\".\n3. The cost amount and profit are correct as per invoice calculation, so no inconsistency here.\n4. The rest of the fields are either empty or match between record/invoice.\n\nHence, all major numeric (quantity, unit price, tax) and categorical (category/type, date) fields are incorrectly recorded, likely due to data entry or mapping errors. The correct values are deduced from the standardized invoice statement, which per the prompt is more reliable.",
