For id `Initial20231231001`, there are three records for Cash deposit, Bank deposit, and Fixed Assets on the same date and id. Their amounts are $3,000,000, $5,000,000, and $8,000,000. According to the invoices (which are most reliable), each type should have a matching amount with the narrative.\n    - \"Fixed Assets\" entry: The invoice says \"Fixed Assets, totaling $8000000.00\"\n    - The `recorded_amount` is `8000000.0`, which matches the invoice.\n    - There is no explicit internal error in this row between fields.\n\nHowever, in the surrounding context, the initial investments (Cash, Bank, Fixed Assets) for the same id should sum up correctly, and the invoice texts explicitly state $3,000,000+$5,000,000 = $8,000,000, which matches the Fixed Asset entry, and is fine.\n\nBut there are _no internal field inconsistencies within the individual transaction rows_ given the invoice, cost, quantity, etc. All the Purchase and Sale rows match their narratives (quantity Ã— unit_price = amount, cost and payment_status, etc.).\n\nTherefore the only error in the given rows is:\n\n- **No actual internal inconsistencies** in the fields for any row in the provided table. All calculated amounts, unit prices, quantities, payment status, and cash/account receivable match with the corresponding invoice description.\n\n**Therefore, there are no field errors to report based on the information given.**\n\n_If you require investigation of duplicated composite keys (`Initial20231231001` occurs three times) or other cross-row logic, please specify._ \n\nIf you found otherwise, please specify which row you suspect contains an internal data inconsistency.",
