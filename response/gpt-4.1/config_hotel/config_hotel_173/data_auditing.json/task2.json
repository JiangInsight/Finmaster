However, per invoice, the 'Fixed Assets' entry **should** be 8,000,000, matching the invoice, not any other amount. There are double entries for deposit amounts for the same id, which may imply an overall internal accounting structure/coding issue, but the invoice supports the 8,000,000 value being correct for 'Fixed Assets'.\n\n2. **Interest20240113013 Date Mismatch**\n   - Invoice text: \"...On January 13, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Interest Receivables, totaling $243.35...\"\n   - Recorded `recorded_date`: 2024-01-18 (this matches the risk_issues entry flagging a difference)\n   - Correct (invoice) date: 2024-01-13 as per the invoice field.\n   - Thus, inconsistency in date.\n\n**Both are inconsistencies based on the more reliable 'invoice' field; the solution lists Original=invoice, Recorded=table cell for each field as per instructions.** If more are required or only the errors need reporting (not the whole table as above), the latter can be trimmed to only the confirmed error rows (like Interest20240113013). Let me know if you wish a stricter filter.\n\n--- \n\n**If only errors are needed, then the only clear error in these rows is Interest20240113013, which matches the initial example.** The first 'Fixed Assets' row may be included if you wish to highlight grouping/repetition/coding issues, but its values are consistent with its invoice.",
