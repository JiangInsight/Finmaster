However, typically the total initial investment should match the total of cash+bank+fixed assets, not have the fixed assets as an additional $8M. But in the records, the invoice and recorded amount show the full $8,000,000 as Fixed Assets, which matches the sum of cash + bank (3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = $8,000,000). The original intention may be to record the proper split for assets and deposits, not three separate entries of the full amount, so the original \"asset category\" should probably have been something like 'Initial Investment' with proper breakdown. Since these three are split, strictly speaking it's a category inconsistency, but the amounts align in total.\n\n2. **Expense20240106001**: This entry is for 'Financial Expenses', prepared and approved correctly, amount matches, but the payment method is recorded as 'Account Payable', while the invoice clearly says payment_method was 'cash'. All other similar expense entries of this type use 'cash' as payment method; thus, this is likely misrecorded and should be 'Cash'.\n\nNo other critical internal inconsistencies (such as quantities, prices, amounts, or major payment status errors) were observed in the provided rows. All the purchases and sales tie out as per the invoice descriptions and the transaction columns. If you need more detailed transaction-by-transaction checking, more anomalies such as various manual journal mis-classifications may appear, but from the above, these are the main clear errors present.",
