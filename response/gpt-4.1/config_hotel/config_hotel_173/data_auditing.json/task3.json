Initial20231231001 (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets)\n- There are three entries with the same id “Initial20231231001”, but different types and amounts ($3,000,000, $5,000,000, $8,000,000). However:\n  - $3,000,000 (Cash deposit) + $5,000,000 (Bank deposit) = $8,000,000 (Fixed Assets) (matches).\n  - But the “Fixed Assets” row shows $8,000,000 as the asset, which matches the sum, so the amount is consistent.\n  - No risk issue and the narration/invoice supports this combination: \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Fixed Assets, totaling $8000000.00.\" and similar for other lines.\n  - **There is no inconsistency in the amounts, but this is a split entry. No correction required.**\n\n### 2. Sale20240124068\n- Invoice says: \"The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- But “recorded_payment/receipt_status” is **Unpaid**.\n- **Correction:** Based on the invoice and other similar entries, payment status should be “Paid”, payment method should be “Cash”.\n- So the recorded_payment/receipt_status is incorrect.\n\n### 3. Interest20240121021\n- Invoice says: \"...The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n- But recorded_payment/receipt_status is **Paid**.\n- **Correction:** Based on the invoice, should be \"Unpaid\".\n\n---\n\nAll other entries are self-consistent or do not have enough evidence of an internal contradiction according to the invoice. \n\nThus, the answer includes only these cases.\n\n**Note:**  \n- The output is wrapped as a list. If the intention is to report one by one, adjust accordingly.  \n- If only the lines with actual error are requested, then ONLY entries 2 and 3 (Sale20240124068 and Interest20240121021) would appear, not the initial asset split rows, as those are not inconsistent but a correct split.\n```",
