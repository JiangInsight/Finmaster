But typically, initial cash/bank/fixed asset entries should not record the same large amount three times each in separate entries under the same id. This may indicate double-counting/duplication of initial entries. However, without further supporting fields, this may be a process/bookkeeping approach rather than an internal field-level inconsistency.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Depreciation\",\n    \"Original date\": \"2024-01-09\",\n    \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-28\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n    \"Original payment_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n    \"Original quantity\": \"5.0\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"5.0\",\n    \"Original price\": \"3088.33\",\n    \"Recorded price\": \"3088.33\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n    \"Original amount\": \"15441.65\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"15441.65\",\n    \"Original tax\": \"772.08\",\n    \"Recorded tax\": \"772.08\",\n    \"Original profit\": \"5441.65\",\n    \"Recorded profit\": \"5441.65\",\n    \"Original Preparer\": null,\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n    \"Original Approver\": null,\n    \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240109020\"\n  }\n]}\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n- For `Initial20231231001`, there are three entries (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) with the same date and id, summing up to the Fixed Assets total, but this is likely initial capital setup and not strictly an internal error field by field in this context. (If needed, you may document the potential overrepresentation; here, I noted the business context.)\n- For `Sale20240109020`, according to the invoice and the risk_issues field, the category (should be 'Sale' but is 'Depreciation') and the date (should be '2024-01-09' but is '2024-01-28') are inconsistent. The invoice is considered the ground truth for 'Original' values.\n- No other field-level inconsistencies were evident (amount = quantity x unit price, cost = cost/unit x quantity, etc.) for the remaining records in your \"problem\" excerpt. \n\nIf desired, the output can be limited to only the explicit, clear field mismatches as shown above (i.e., as in the provided examples and as in the second entry).",
