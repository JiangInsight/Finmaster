Reviewing the Example and Task\n\n   - Your example shows that only *inconsistent* rows, i.e., those with mismatches between recorded fields and more reliable sources such as the invoice, are output with corrections. Others are left blank (`null`).\n   - The task is to **analyze each transaction** and for each inconsistency, output the transaction id, fields with errors, current value, and best estimate (from the \"invoice\" text etc).\n\n2. Looking for actual errors/inconsistencies\n\n   - Nearly all transactions are consistent: the numerical breakdown and key descriptive fields (quantity * price = amount, payment method, etc) match what is described in the invoice column.\n   - However, for `Sale20240125071`, we see a mismatch:\n     - invoice: \"3.0 units at a unit price of $195.67, totaling $587.01.\"\n     - recorded_unit_price: 231.68, recorded_amount: 634.47\n     - Thus, the correct values from the reliable invoice are price=195.67 and amount=587.01, but the recorded values are 231.68, 634.47 -- inconsistent.\n\n3. Approach to output\n\n   - For *consistent* rows, output nulls; for errors, report the fields with values as shown above.\n   - Only the record `Sale20240125071` (and none other in this sample) shows a clear field-level error between the reliable \"invoice\" record and the individual field values -- so only that record is output with actual data.\n\n## Note\n\n- Other rows with perfect matches (recorded unit price=invoice price and amount, etc) are not included except as `null`.\n- If you want *only* the error rows and not the `null` entries, you can filter to output only records with any non-null correction.\n- The actual \"solution\" field above shows both (for full reasoning and traceability).\n```",
