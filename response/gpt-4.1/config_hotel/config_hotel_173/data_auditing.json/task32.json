Initial20231231001 (Initial Balances: Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets):\n\n- There are three entries with the same ID but different types: \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\".  \n- Each row's recorded_amount (3000000.00, 5000000.00, 8000000.00) disagrees with the sum/logic needed for opening balances:\n  - The \"Fixed Assets\" opening should be the sum of the cash and bank deposit, based on initial equity balancing (since no other sources shown or equity imbalance would result).\n- **Original/Correct value based on the invoice logic:** Fixed Assets amount should be the sum of cash and bank deposited (8000000.00 matches this sum), while the others match their components.  \n- **Error:** The decomposition is correct but there is an implicit consistency required between these rows: \"Fixed Assets\" = \"Cash deposit\" + \"Bank deposit\".\n- **Solution:** Highlight this as an internal consistency check across the entries.\n\n### 2. Sale20240110021\n\n- **Invoice:** \"On January 10, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $8771.97, totaling $8771.97.\"\n- **Recorded:**\n  - recorded_date: 2024-01-30 (invoice says 2024-01-10)\n  - recorded_quantity: 0.0 (invoice says 1.0)\n  - recorded_unit_price: 9274.77 (invoice says 8771.97)\n  - recorded_amount: 0.0 (invoice says 8771.97)\n- The tax, profit, etc. appear consistent with the (original) invoice.\n- **Errors:** Date, quantity, price, and amount are all inconsistent with the invoice.\n- **Solution:** List all the mismatches with invoice values as the correct ones.\n\n---\n\nNote: The rest of the records do not show inconsistencies based on internal calculation and the invoice content, other than the two highlighted above (unless more are explicitly asked for or their risk_issues/outlying content suggest otherwise). If more lines similar to the above example occur, the same structured format and attention to calculation/cross-row consistency should be used.",
