In this problem, the Fixed Assets row is for $8,000,000, not the $5m as previously.\n- Invoice says $8m, but usual pattern is $5m for fixed assets and the sum total is $8m. So **the $8m may be double-counting the \"cash\" and \"bank\" deposits** as well or an error.\n- The most reliable field is the invoice, so likely the amount should be $8,000,000, however, cross-checking previous patterns suggests it should be $5,000,000.\n- *This records the likely inconsistency.*\n\n2. **Expense20240108001 missing preparer:**  \n- There are two rows for `Expense20240108001`. One has \"Senior Staff\" as preparer, one is blank (`\"\"`) but invoice text says it was “prepared by Senior Staff.”\n- The correct preparer should be “Senior Staff”.\n\n*No other obvious errors are present in the sample data provided.*  \n*If you found more entries in the actual data set with e.g. mismatching calculated amounts from quantity × unit price, or mismatching payment status, those would also be detected—none else are immediately apparent in the above chunk.*\n\nIf you need this for specific other rows, or want me to itemize further, let me know!",
