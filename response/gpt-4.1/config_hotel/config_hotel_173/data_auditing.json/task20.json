The sum in the Fixed Assets row is $8,000,000.00, while the standardized, more reliable 'invoice' for Fixed Assets says $5,000,000.00 (\"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Fixed Assets, totaling $5000000.00.\"). Thus, the Fixed Assets value should be $5,000,000.00. This is an internal inconsistency in the 'recorded_amount' field for that row.\n\n2. **Sale20240202096**\n   - The 'recorded_type' is \"Administrative Expenses\" but the invoice and all fields indicate this is a Sale (\"On February 02, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 5.0 units at a unit price of $6648.64, totaling $33243.20.\"). Thus 'recorded_type' is incorrect. Also, the recorded unit price is $6694.41, but invoice (and total/quantity) confirm the correct should be $6648.64 ($33243.20/5 = $6648.64). Two errors: category and unit price.\n\nNo other internal field mismatches found where invoice and data row fields disagree on these standardized or calculable fields.",
