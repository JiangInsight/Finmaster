One line (Fixed Assets) says 8,000,000, but the sum of Cash deposit (3,000,000) and Bank deposit (5,000,000) is 8,000,000, which implies that Fixed Assets are the sum of the deposits, but each is listed separately.\n- More importantly, the invoice text is for each as a standalone line, not a summary.\n- Usually, initialization/investment/funding is split into asset categories, NOT into \"Sale\" nor a mixture of \"Initial\", \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\"; initial capital should not be recorded as \"Sale\".\n- Given regulatory and accounting standards and the standardized invoice, the original category for each of the above should be something like \"Initial Capital\" (for an initial capital injection), and more granular breakdown among \"Cash\", \"Bank\", \"Fixed Assets\" as asset classes. However, there is an internal inconsistency, as all lines share the same `id` and date, with the same invoice context, but the field `recorded_type` differs, but the actual event is a capital injection into the company, i.e., the initial funding entry.\n- The fields for \"category\" should be harmonized for these entries and not split across asset categories in this way. Likely, there is a misrecording of type, possibly some should be \"Initial Funding\" or \"Initial Investment\", not \"Sale\".\n- However, as per the invoice record, no purchase/sale event occurred here, just capital categorization.\n\n**Key discrepancies:**\n- These should likely all be recorded as an \"Initial Capital\" or \"Initial Funding\" category, not as asset type (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) as type. The field \"category\" and \"type\" is incorrect.\n- All three rows have the same id, which is suspicious—ideally, such fundamentally distinct entries would get unique IDs.\n\n**Estimated corrections (as per the invoice statement and best practice):**\n- Category/type should be \"Initial Capital\" or \"Initial Funding\", not as three separate asset classes as the primary recorded_type.\n- The split into Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets should be under asset classification, not transaction type.\n- All three entries should be summarized or at least have harmonized types.\n\n**Therefore, the key error is in the recorded_type (category), which should be \"Initial Funding\" for all three entries, not \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", and \"Fixed Assets\".** The recorded amounts are consistent with the totals from the invoice. There are no other significant field errors visible.\n\nIf you require only one field to focus on:\n- **Recorded field incorrect:** `recorded_type`\n- **Best estimate:** \"Initial Funding\" or \"Initial Capital\" for all three\n- **Also, shared id may be an error; should likely have unique entries.**\n\n**Note:** For completeness, all three rows are included, as they all share the same ID and should be corrected together.\n\n---\n\nIf you would like the output formatted only for the most egregious single-row issue, please specify which row you’d like focused, but as the entire ID block is inconsistent, the above is the comprehensive answer.",
