The correct value should be $5,000,000.00.\n\n2. **Depreciation20240101001:**\n   - The invoice amount is $45,751.41, but the recorded entry is $45,741.99. This is a minor difference but an inconsistency.\n\n3. **Sale20240108018:**\n   - The invoice clearly describes a Sale (not a Depreciation) for $7,126.65 on Jan 8, 2024, but the record lists category 'Depreciation', date '2024-02-04', and amount $7,533.49. The correct category, date, and amount should match the invoice details.\n\n**No inconsistencies were found in other entries upon item-by-item cross-check.**",
