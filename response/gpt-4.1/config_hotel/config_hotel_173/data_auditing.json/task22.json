For id = **Initial20231231001**:\n   - There are three entries for this id: \"Cash deposit\" ($3,000,000), \"Bank deposit\" ($5,000,000), \"Fixed Assets\" ($8,000,000).\n   - The invoice says: \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Fixed Assets, totaling $8,000,000.00.\"\n   - The other two \"deposit\" types (cash and bank) are not referenced in the invoice, and the total in the \"Fixed Assets\" row matches the invoice. Thus, the only correct record for Initial20231231001, based on the invoice, is for Fixed Assets at $8,000,000. The other entries should be excluded for accuracy.\n\n2. For id = **Sale20240127079**:\n   - The \"Recorded date\" is 2024-02-05, while the invoice says \"On January 27, 2024...\".\n   - The unit price in the record (\"2130.44\") is different from the unit price in invoice description (\"2046.52\"). The invoice is more trustworthy here.\n   - The original/preferred values are drawn from the invoice text, and the recorded values are listed as found in the table.\n   - All other row values match (quantity, sums, etc.), except for these two inconsistencies.\n",
