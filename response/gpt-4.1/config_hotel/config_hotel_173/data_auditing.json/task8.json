While this is nonstandard structurally, it's not a value inconsistency.\n- **ID: Interest20240117017:** The recorded_amount is 215.24 but the invoice explicitly states $183.68; the invoice is more reliable. The correct value is $183.68.\n\nNo other line in the given problem has an internal inconsistency between invoice and fields for date, payment/receipt status, payment method, quantity, unit price, receive_method, amount, tax, profit, preparer, or approver.\n\n**If you need explicit JSON format for just the detected inconsistency, only the second block is correct.**",
