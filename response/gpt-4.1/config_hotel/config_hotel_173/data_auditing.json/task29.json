However, in the data above, cash deposit ($3,000,000) + bank deposit ($5,000,000) = $8,000,000, which matches fixed assets ($8,000,000) amount, indicating records are in balance, and not really an inconsistencyâ€”just a different line for each type of asset. Thus, there is no internal inconsistency, and all fields are either omitted or correct per the invoice, so NO error.\n\nHowever, in the ORIGINAL PROBLEM description, the actual example inconsistency is for \"Sale20240131090\". So let's examine that record for **actual inconsistency**:\n\n| id             | recorded_type | recorded_date | recorded_amount | ... | invoice                                                                                                                                                                                         | risk_issues |\n\n| Sale20240131090| Sale          | 2024-03-01    | 738.89          | ... | ...On January 31, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $594.97, totaling $594.97. ...tax amount of $29.75... | [ ... ]     |\n\nThe invoice says:\n- Date: Jan 31, 2024 (but recorded_date is Mar 1, 2024)\n- Amount: $594.97 (but recorded_amount is $738.89)\n- Unit price: $594.97 (but recorded_unit_price is $537.14)\n- Tax: $29.75 (but recorded_tax_amount is $657.46)\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Original category\": null,\n  \"Recorded category\": null,\n  \"Original date\": \"2024-01-31\",\n  \"Recorded date\": \"2024-03-01\",\n  \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null,\n  \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null,\n  \"Original payment_method\": null,\n  \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n  \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\",\n  \"Recorded quantity\": \"1.0\",\n  \"Original price\": \"594.97\",\n  \"Recorded price\": \"537.14\",\n  \"Original receive_method\": null,\n  \"Recorded receive_method\": null,\n  \"Original amount\": \"594.97\",\n  \"Recorded amount\": \"738.89\",\n  \"Original tax\": \"29.75\",\n  \"Recorded tax\": \"657.46\",\n  \"Original profit\": null,\n  \"Recorded profit\": null,\n  \"Original Preparer\": null,\n  \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n  \"Original Approver\": null,\n  \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n  \"id\": \"Sale20240131090\"\n}}\n```\n\n**Summary:**  \nYou only need to report entries where the invoice indicates the value is different from the recorded value, as in the example for \"Sale20240131090\" (not the Initial... lines which are in balance but not inconsistent). So the above \"solution\" is the correct JSON output for your user query.",
