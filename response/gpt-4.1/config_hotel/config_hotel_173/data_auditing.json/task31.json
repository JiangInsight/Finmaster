Usually, initial cash, initial bank, and initial fixed assets should have separate transaction IDs for clarity/auditing. Having multiple fundamentally different types and amounts with the same ID is a *structural data error*.\n   - However, the risk_issue/invoice texts, recorded_type, date, and amount itself for each row match, indicating the field values inside each row are not internally mismatched for that single entry.\n   - **However, the most likely error is multiple transaction types recorded under same ID.**\n\n5. **According to the task, for each internal inconsistency or error in the recorded information in the *row*, report the incorrect field(s), their recorded and correct values.**\n\n6. **In this case, no single row has internal mis-recorded values.**  \n   - The only possible issue is across rows: using the same transaction ID for three different types of initial capital injections. By field, there is no mis-entry in single row.\n   - For the Fixed Assets row: The invoice, type and amount match, but exploring further for consistency:\n     - bank deposit row is for 5,000,000 (invoice text and value match)\n     - cash deposit row is for 3,000,000 (invoice text and value match)\n     - fixed asset row is for 8,000,000 (invoice text and value match)\n     - If the intention was to represent capitalization, there should be three different transaction IDs or a composite breakdown in one.\n\n7. **Therefore, in each row, there is no field-level inconsistency (i.e., the invoice text matches the type and amount for that row), but the data model and assignment of transaction IDs is incorrect (structural problem).**  \n   - THIS IS NOT WHAT THE FIELD-LEVEL ERROR FORMAT ASKS FOR.\n\n8. **Return blank rows for all except the next error found (e.g. in the Sale20240119053 entry, if prompted), or acknowledge no field-level inconsistency in this row.**\n\n---\n\nBut if you are requiring a true field-level mismatch, the answer is: **No internal field mismatches for any row for 'Initial20231231001', only a transaction grouping/id structure issue.**\n\n**If you want the first with a _field-level_ error, see the 'Sale20240119053' example, where**\n- Recorded quantity: 1 vs original quantity: 2\n- Recorded amount: 1117.97 vs correct 1040.92, etc.\n\n---\n\n**But for your requested 'problem' data above, none of the single row entries show field-level mismatches, so the correct output is:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Original category\": null,\n  \"Recorded category\": null,\n  \"Original date\": null,\n  \"Recorded date\": null,\n  \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null,\n  \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null,\n  \"Original payment_method\": null,\n  \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n  \"Original quantity\": null,\n  \"Recorded quantity\": null,\n  \"Original price\": null,\n  \"Recorded price\": null,\n  \"Original receive_method\": null,\n  \"Recorded receive_method\": null,\n  \"Original amount\": null,\n  \"Recorded amount\": null,\n  \"Original tax\": null,\n  \"Recorded tax\": null,\n  \"Original profit\": null,\n  \"Recorded profit\": null,\n  \"Original Preparer\": null,\n  \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n  \"Original Approver\": null,\n  \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n  \"id\": null\n}}\n```\n\n**OR** (if you want the detail for the first true error in the list):\n\nFor `Sale20240119053`:\n- Invoice says: 2.0 Ã— 520.46 = 1040.92, tax 52.05.\n- Recorded: quantity=1, amount=1117.97, tax=1155.14, unit price=496.58.\n\nSo:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n  \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\",\n  \"Original date\": \"2024-01-19\",\n  \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-19\",\n  \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n  \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n  \"Original payment_method\": null,\n  \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n  \"Original quantity\": \"2.0\",\n  \"Recorded quantity\": \"1\",\n  \"Original price\": \"520.46\",\n  \"Recorded price\": \"496.58\",\n  \"Original receive_method\": \"Cash\",\n  \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\",\n  \"Original amount\": \"1040.92\",\n  \"Recorded amount\": \"1117.97\",\n  \"Original tax\": \"52.05\",\n  \"Recorded tax\": \"1155.14\",\n  \"Original profit\": \"340.92\",\n  \"Recorded profit\": \"340.92\",\n  \"Original Preparer\": null,\n  \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n  \"Original Approver\": null,\n  \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n  \"id\": \"Sale20240119053\"\n}}\n```\n\nBecause that's the first **field-level** error found in the table above per your instructions and format.",
