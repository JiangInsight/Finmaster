The sum of 'Cash deposit' (3000000.0) and 'Bank deposit' (5000000.0) is 8000000.0, which matches the amount for 'Fixed Assets'. This indicates they are likely the sources/funding for Fixed Assets rather than three distinct events. However, no clear error in recorded fields, as all are cross-referenced and internally consistent.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Administrative Expenses\",\n    \"Original quantity\": \"3.0\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"2.0\",\n    \"Original amount\": \"8138.91\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"5425.94\",\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240106013\",\n    \"Issue\": \"The invoice and detailed narration say this is a Sale with 3.0 units (total 8138.91), while the row records 2.0 units (5425.94) and category as 'Administrative Expenses'.

The amounts reconcile.\n- The key error is on `Sale20240106013`, where the recorded category, quantity, and amount diverge from the (much more reliable) invoice text. Category should be 'Sale' not 'Administrative Expenses', quantity 3.0 not 2.0, and amount 8138.91 not 5425.94.\n- All other entries are internally consistent with invoice—fields line up and calculated totals/checks (unit price × quantity = amount, cost = quantity × cost per, etc.) match.\n- No tax or profit inconsistency found given the fields provided and the invoice line items.\n- The solution lists both the critical errors with the fields 'as recorded' and the best estimate of the 'original'/correct value per invoice, matching the example format.\n",
