So, the correct calculation (5 × 3088.33 = 15441.65) matches the \"Original amount\" in the solution.\n- The recorded_tax_amount of 16760.64 is much too high; from invoice (and normal VAT/tax logic), the correct \"tax\" would be about 15441.65 × (some reasonable VAT percent). But the invoice says the tax is 772.08 for this transaction.\n- The recorded unit price is 3536.61, while invoice shows 3088.33, so the recorded value is incorrect.\n- Also, \"recorded_type\" is incorrectly listed as \"Financial Expenses\" instead of \"Sale\".\n\nTherefore, the solution above fills in the mismatched fields according to the reliable invoice description. All other fields (date, payment status, payment method, receive method, profit, Preparer, Approver) are not explicitly contradicted by the invoice, so set as null to indicate \"not applicable\" for correction.",
