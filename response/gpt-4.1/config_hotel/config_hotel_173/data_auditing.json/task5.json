The cost amount for this transaction was $6,000.00, ...\".\n    - In the data row: `recorded_quantity` is 2.0, `recorded_amount` is 7,056.08 (which is 2 Ã— 3528.04).\n    - Thus, inconsistency between `invoice` and recorded fields: \n        - \"Original quantity\" (per invoice) is 3.0, \"Recorded quantity\" 2.0. \n        - \"Original amount\" should be 10,584.12, \"Recorded\" is 7,056.08.\n    - The correct values (from the reliable invoice) are: quantity 3.0, amount 10,584.12, profit 4,584.12 (matching 10,584.12 - 6,000).\n\n(If you want all the cases, let me know; above are the two clear inconsistencies following the risk example given. Most rows match their invoice exactly, except for these discrepancies involving `quantity`/`amount` and (historically) capital flow grouping for \"Initial...\").",
