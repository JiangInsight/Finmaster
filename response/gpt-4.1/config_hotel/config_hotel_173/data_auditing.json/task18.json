This suggests a prior error, but in your data, all three amounts are separate. However, standard accounting and the sample both indicate the segregated deposits are for the initial capital injection in different asset accounts (cash, bank, fixed assets) and the Fixed Asset should match the sum.\n   - In the given row, the invoice/narrative says: \"an invoice was issued for a Fixed Assets, totaling $8,000,000.00\", but in context, the \"Fixed Assets\" entry should reflect the sum of the previous lines. But in your record, it's already 8,000,000, which means most likely the error is that, in typical bookkeeping, the sum of cash + bank = fixed assets assigned. (But in your sample, they're shown as three separate lines, but all tied to the same id.) This is ambiguous.\n   - Given the ambiguity but following the sample, \"Original amount\" should be 5,000,000.\n\n2. **Sale20240202096:**\n   - The invoice in the risk_issues field/narrative says:  \n     \"On February 02, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 5.0 units at a unit price of $6648.64, totaling $33243.20. The cost amount for this transaction was $25000.00, with a tax amount of $1662.16, leading to a total amount due of $31581.04. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n   - But in the row, recorded_quantity = 4.0, recorded_unit_price = 6648.64, recorded_amount = 26594.56 (=4×the unit price), recorded_payment/receipt_status = Paid, recorded_receive_method = Cash, recorded_after_tax_amount = 31581.04\n   - However, “The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.” Thus, payment/receipt_status, receive_method, quantity, and amount diverge from invoice (which is more reliable).\n   - Thus, correction should match the invoice:\n     - payment/receipt_status: Unpaid\n     - receive_method: Account Receivable\n     - quantity: 5.00\n     - amount: 33243.20\n     - profit is based on amount - cost_amount = 33243.20 - 25000 = 8243.2 (not 8548.35).\n     - payment_method could be blank, as per the invoice info.\n\n**Other fields are left blank if not specifically addressed or visible as inconsistent.**\n\nIf you need check for other types or more cases, please clarify.",
