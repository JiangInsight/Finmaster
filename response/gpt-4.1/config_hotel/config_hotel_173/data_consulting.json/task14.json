Let's align with the format used in the example:\n\n- In the example, when opening AR = 0 and ending AR >0, the average was simply (0 + ending)/2.\n- Calculation as above stands: (0 + 335,967.05)/2 = 167,983.53\n\nSo our calculation is correct with above number.  \n851,679.79 ÷ 167,983.53 ≈ **5.07**\n\n**Correction:** My initial calculation above is correct and matches the method in your example.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"5.07\"} }\n```",
