The first entry for Interest Receivable is on 2024-01-01.\n  - 2024-01-01: Interest Receivables = 374.69\n\nAlthough this is a transaction, in cash flow computation, unless there is an explicit opening balance elsewhere, we often take the total of all prior periods and treat the first entry as the opening. Here, as this is the first transaction for 'Interest Receivables', we consider it as the opening balance.\n\n- Closing date: 2024-02-04 (last entry for Interest Receivables in the range).\n  - 2024-02-04: Interest Receivables = 176.45202121999998\n\nBut we need to sum up all the Interest Receivable \"Unpaid\" amounts to compute closing and opening balances correctly.\n\n**2. Sum up all 'Interest Receivables' (Unpaid) amounts**\nWe need to track the running balance - assume each day adds more receivable, unless some are paid (but no 'Paid' entries for Interest Receivable appear).\n\nLet's add up entries for 'Interest Receivables':\n\n| Date         | Description         | Amount           | Comments |\n|--------------|--------------------|------------------|----------|\n| 2024-01-01   | Interest Receivable |   374.69         | Start    |\n| 2024-01-02   | Interest Receivable |   328.36728      |          |\n| 2024-01-03   | Interest Receivable |   328.36728      |          |\n| 2024-01-04   | Interest Receivable |   314.61678      |          |\n| 2024-01-05   | Interest Receivable |   314.61678      |          |\n| 2024-01-06   | Interest Receivable |   304.2109       |          |\n| 2024-01-07   | Interest Receivable |   304.2109       |          |\n| 2024-01-08   | Interest Receivable |   243.35332122   |          |\n| 2024-01-09   | Interest Receivable |   243.35332122   |          |\n| 2024-01-10   | Interest Receivable |   243.35332122   |          |\n| 2024-01-11   | Interest Receivable |   243.35332122   |          |\n| 2024-01-12   | Interest Receivable |   243.35332122   |          |\n| 2024-01-13   | Interest Receivable |   243.35332122   |          |\n| 2024-01-14   | Interest Receivable |   203.43682121999998 |       |\n| 2024-01-15   | Interest Receivable |   183.67882121999997 |       |\n| 2024-01-16   | Interest Receivable |   183.67882121999997 |       |\n| 2024-01-17   | Interest Receivable |   183.67882121999997 |       |\n| 2024-01-18   | Interest Receivable |   183.67882121999997 |       |\n| 2024-01-19   | Interest Receivable |   183.67882121999997 |       |\n| 2024-01-20   | Interest Receivable |   183.67882121999997 |       |\n| 2024-01-21   | Interest Receivable |   183.67882121999997 |       |\n| 2024-01-22   | Interest Receivable |   183.67882121999997 |       |\n| 2024-01-23   | Interest Receivable |   183.67882121999997 |       |\n| 2024-01-24   | Interest Receivable |   183.67882121999997 |       |\n| 2024-01-25   | Interest Receivable |   183.67882121999997 |       |\n| 2024-01-26   | Interest Receivable |   183.67882121999997 |       |\n| 2024-01-27   | Interest Receivable |   183.67882121999997 |       |\n| 2024-01-28   | Interest Receivable |   183.67882121999997 |       |\n| 2024-01-29   | Interest Receivable |   183.67882121999997 |       |\n| 2024-01-30   | Interest Receivable |   183.67882121999997 |       |\n| 2024-01-31   | Interest Receivable |   183.67882121999997 |       |\n| 2024-02-01   | Interest Receivable |   183.67882121999997 |       |\n| 2024-02-02   | Interest Receivable |   183.67882121999997 |       |\n| 2024-02-03   | Interest Receivable |   176.45202121999998 |       |\n| 2024-02-04   | Interest Receivable |   176.45202121999998 | End    |\n\n**Note:** Up to 2024-02-02 the value is the same (183.67882121999997) for many days, then slightly less for the last two days.\n\n**3. Find Opening Balance (2023-12-31) and Closing Balance (2024-02-04)**\n - Since first interest receivable on 2024-01-01 is 374.69, we take this as opening balance.\n - The closing balance is the cumulative sum of all \"Interest Receivable\" entries, i.e., by adding all the \"amount\" fields for entries up to and including 2024-02-04.\n\nHowever, the cash flow line \"Increase/Decrease in Interest Receivable\" is generally:\n> (Opening Balance of Interest Receivable) - (Closing Balance of Interest Receivable)\n\nBut in cash flow statements, we interpret as:  \nIf Interest Receivable increased during the period (more is owed to us), this represents a \"use\" of cash (a negative contribution to cash flows).  \nIf Interest Receivable decreased (less owed to us), this is \"source\" of cash (positive contribution).\n\nSo let's calculate:\n\n- **Opening Balance (2024-01-01):** 374.69\n- **Closing Balance (2024-02-04):** To compute it, we sum all entries, as there are no \"received/paid\" (cleared) entries for Interest Receivable.\n\nBut actually, in most systems, the Interest Receivable account would be *cumulative*, with each day adding up. However, in this data, each daily transaction is separate and likely the receivable is fully accumulated from the start to the last balance.\n\nBut for the sake of the cash flow and in line with accounting principle and the instruction/example, we follow this approach:\n\n- Opening balance: the receivable as at the start of the period (here, after first transaction)\n- Closing balance: the receivable at the end of the period (after last transaction)\n\nBut since each day's Interest Receivable is just another cumulative *addition* (rather than showing balance), we sum up all Interest Receivable \"amount\" fields from 2024-01-01 to 2024-02-04.\n\n**Sum all Interest Receivable transactions**:\n\nCalculate total Interest Receivable added during the period:\n```\nSum all \"amount\" fields of type 'Interest Receivables'\n```\n\nLet's sum them:\n\n- 2024-01-01: 374.69\n- 2024-01-02: 328.36728\n- 2024-01-03: 328.36728\n- 2024-01-04: 314.61678\n- 2024-01-05: 314.61678\n- 2024-01-06: 304.2109\n- 2024-01-07: 304.2109\n- 2024-01-08: 243.35332122\n- 2024-01-09: 243.35332122\n- 2024-01-10: 243.35332122\n- 2024-01-11: 243.35332122\n- 2024-01-12: 243.35332122\n- 2024-01-13: 243.35332122\n- 2024-01-14: 203.43682121999998\n- 2024-01-15: 183.67882121999997\n- 2024-01-16: 183.67882121999997\n- 2024-01-17: 183.67882121999997\n- 2024-01-18: 183.67882121999997\n- 2024-01-19: 183.67882121999997\n- 2024-01-20: 183.67882121999997\n- 2024-01-21: 183.67882121999997\n- 2024-01-22: 183.67882121999997\n- 2024-01-23: 183.67882121999997\n- 2024-01-24: 183.67882121999997\n- 2024-01-25: 183.67882121999997\n- 2024-01-26: 183.67882121999997\n- 2024-01-27: 183.67882121999997\n- 2024-01-28: 183.67882121999997\n- 2024-01-29: 183.67882121999997\n- 2024-01-30: 183.67882121999997\n- 2024-01-31: 183.67882121999997\n- 2024-02-01: 183.67882121999997\n- 2024-02-02: 183.67882121999997\n- 2024-02-03: 176.45202121999998\n- 2024-02-04: 176.45202121999998\n\nLet's add all of these together.\n\nFirst, partial sum up to 2024-01-13:\n\n- 2024-01-01: 374.69\n- 2024-01-02: 328.36728\n- 2024-01-03: 328.36728\n- 2024-01-04: 314.61678\n- 2024-01-05: 314.61678\n- 2024-01-06: 304.2109\n- 2024-01-07: 304.2109\n- 2024-01-08: 243.35332122\n- 2024-01-09: 243.35332122\n- 2024-01-10: 243.35332122\n- 2024-01-11: 243.35332122\n- 2024-01-12: 243.35332122\n- 2024-01-13: 243.35332122\n\nFirst subtotal:\n374.69 + 328.36728 + 328.36728 + 314.61678 + 314.61678 + 304.2109 + 304.2109 + 243.35332122 + 243.35332122 + 243.35332122 + 243.35332122 + 243.35332122 + 243.35332122\nLet's step through:\n\n- 374.69  (running sum: 374.69)\n- +328.36728   → 703.05728\n- +328.36728   → 1031.42456\n- +314.61678   → 1346.04134\n- +314.61678   → 1660.65812\n- +304.2109    → 1964.86902\n- +304.2109    → 2269.07992\n- +243.35332122→ 2512.43324122\n- +243.35332122→ 2755.78656244\n- +243.35332122→ 2999.13988366\n- +243.35332122→ 3242.49320488\n- +243.35332122→ 3485.8465261\n- +243.35332122→ 3729.19984732\n\nSubtotal up to 2024-01-13: **3729.19984732**\n\nNow add 2024-01-14:\n+ 203.43682121999998 → 3932.63666854\n\nFrom 2024-01-15 to 2024-02-02 mostly 183.67882121999997 per day.\n\nNumber of days from 2024-01-15 to 2024-02-02 inclusive:\n\nFrom Jan 15 to Feb 2 (inclusive):\n- Jan 15, 16, ..., 31: (31 - 15 + 1) = 17 days (Jan 15 to Jan 31)\n- Plus Feb 1 and Feb 2: 2 days\nTotal: 17 + 2 = 19 days\n\nCheck list:\n2024-01-15\n2024-01-16\n2024-01-17\n2024-01-18\n2024-01-19\n2024-01-20\n2024-01-21\n2024-01-22\n2024-01-23\n2024-01-24\n2024-01-25\n2024-01-26\n2024-01-27\n2024-01-28\n2024-01-29\n2024-01-30\n2024-01-31\n2024-02-01\n2024-02-02\n→ That's 19 days.\n\nNow sum for those days:\n19 × 183.67882121999997 =\n\nLet's compute 19 × 183.67882121999997:\n- 10 × 183.67882121999997 = 1,836.7882121999997\n- 9 × 183.67882121999997 = 1,653.1093909799997\n- Total: 3,489.897603179999\n\nAdd to previous subtotal:\n3932.63666854 + 3,489.897603179999 = 7422.534271719999\n\nNext, add 2024-02-03: 176.45202121999998\n7422.534271719999 + 176.45202121999998 = 7598.986292939999\n\nThen 2024-02-04: 176.45202121999998\n7598.986292939999 + 176.45202121999998 = 7775.438314159998\n\n**So, total Interest Receivable entries from 2024-01-01 through 2024-02-04 sum to:**  \n**7775.438314159998**\n\nBut the cash flow line is about the change in balance, not the sum of increased transaction entries.\n\n**But what is the \"closing balance\" of Interest Receivable on 2024-02-04?**\n\nSince every entry is \"unpaid\" and there's no 'Paid' entry, and each one is a receivable, if none were collected, the closing balance is the sum of all posted interest since 2024-01-01. The opening balance is the amount as of the start of the period (374.69, 2024-01-01).\n\nBut in the example you gave, the model only considered the sum of \"amount\" fields for the period as the *increase* in receivable (that is, if none is collected). The cash flow line is:\n\n(Increase)/Decrease in Interest Receivable = Opening balance - Closing balance\n\nIf closing is higher, the number is negative (increase in receivables “uses” cash).\n\nSo:\n- **Opening Balance (Start of 2024-01-01):** 0 (assuming zero or not provided from prior year)\n- **Closing Balance (as of 2024-02-04):** Sum of all the above\n    - If Opening as of 2024-01-01 is 0, then Change = 0 - [sum above] = negative sum above.\n\nBut typically, you’d take opening as of 2023-12-31 (but there is no opening balance entry). So let's follow your example and take opening = 0.\n\n**Therefore:**\n(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable = 0 - 7775.44 = **-7775.44**\n\nAlternatively, taking the period 2024-01-01 to 2024-02-04, the total increase in receivable is 7775.44, that is, the interest that has been accrued but not received.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-7775.44\"} }\n```\n\n(Rounded to two decimal places as in the example)",
