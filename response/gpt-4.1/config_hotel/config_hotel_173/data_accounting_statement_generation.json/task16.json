In this dataset, there are **NO such transactions**. Only sales, purchases, expenses, interest, and depreciationâ€”none of these affect paid-in capital.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:  \n   - The **paid-in capital remains unchanged** from beginning to end of the report period.\n\n**Therefore:**\n- **Paid-in Capital Initial Value**: 16,000,000.00\n- **Paid-in Capital End Value**: 16,000,000.00",
