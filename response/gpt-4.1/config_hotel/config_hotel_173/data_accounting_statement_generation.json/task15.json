No new unpaid purchases after 2023-12-31.\n\n## Step 4: Any Other Liabilities?\n\nSome might ask about other obligations, e.g., \"Interest Receivables\"—those are *assets*, not liabilities.\n\nSo, **Total Liabilities = Total Unpaid Purchases (Account Payable) still outstanding**.\n\n## Step 5: Final Formatting\n\n### Initial Liabilities: **3,333,720.00**\n### End Liabilities: **3,333,720.00**\n\n(Both values the same, since no new or paid purchases.)\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"3333720.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"3333720.00\"} }\n```",
