What are we looking for?\nWe need to calculate \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" for the cash flow statement, based on the provided transactions data.\n\n## 2. How to identify \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\"?\n\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" refers to the cash outflow for fixed (non-current) assets.  \nWe should look for transactions with `type` = **\"Fixed Assets Purchase\"** or similar and also consider if any other lines in the initial/opening balances suggest a cash outflow for fixed assets (but such opening entries are usually only for accumulated positions, not for the period's cash outflow).\n\n## 3. Go through the list, filter out ONLY direct purchases of fixed assets (not inventory):\n\nFrom the data provided, these specific lines are relevant:\n\n- | FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 251793.02 | 251793.02 |  |  | Paid | Bank Transfer |  | S009 | Supplier 9 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Kitchen Equipment4 | Kitchen Equipment |\n\nOther lines with \"Purchase\" type, but for items like \"Luxury Suite\", \"Banquet Set\", \"Business Meal Set\" etc are inventory for the hotel/restaurant.\nOpening balance for \"Fixed Assets\" is NOT a cash flow for the period, just balance sheet.\n\n## 4. Confirm: Are there any other cash outflow entries relating to purchase of fixed assets during the period?\nCheck for:\n- Any additional \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" type row? **NO** (Only one)\n- Any purchase for asset types (Kitchen Equipment, Storage Facilities, Leasehold Improvements etc)? **NOT FOUND** except above.\n\n## 5. Conclusion:\n**Purchase of Fixed Assets** = **251793.02**\n\n## 6. Present in required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"251793.02\"} }\n```",
