Inventory Initial Value**\n\nLooking at the \"Initial\" entries, there is **no explicit inventory asset** at opening. \n- Initial20231231001 entries are for cash, bank deposit, fixed assets only.\n\nSo,  \n**Inventory Initial Value = 0.00**\n\n---\n\n### **2. Inventory Changes During the Period**\n\n#### **a. Calculate all Purchases (add to inventory)**\n- Only rows with type \"Purchase\" and not \"Fixed Assets Purchase\"\n- All are *before sales*, so opening balance for product is the purchases sum.\n\nGo through each \"Purchase\" row and sum `(quantity × unit_price)`, or take the `amount` if it matches.\n\n##### **Luxury Suite (R003)**\n- Purchase20231231001: 158 × 5000 = 790,000\n- Purchase20231231002: 299 × 5000 = 1,495,000\n- Purchase20231231004: 268 × 5000 = 1,340,000\n\nSum: 790,000 + 1,495,000 + 1,340,000 = **3,625,000**\n\n##### **Banquet Set (F004)**\n- Purchase20231231003: 130 × 2,880 = 374,400\n- Purchase20231231020: 182 × 2,880 = 524,160\n- Purchase20231231022: 291 × 2,880 = 838,080\n\nSum: 374,400 + 524,160 + 838,080 = **1,736,640**\n\n##### **Deluxe Meal Set (F003)**\n- Purchase20231231005: 166 × 880 = 146,080\n- Purchase20231231010: 291 × 880 = 256,080\n- Purchase20231231012: 109 × 880 = 95,920\n\nSum: 146,080 + 256,080 + 95,920 = **498,080**\n\n##### **Business Room (R002)**\n- Purchase20231231006: 222 × 2,000 = 444,000\n- Purchase20231231014: 216 × 2,000 = 432,000\n- Purchase20231231019: 111 × 2,000 = 222,000\n\nSum: 444,000 + 432,000 + 222,000 = **1,098,000**\n\n##### **Standard Room (R001)**\n- Purchase20231231007: 103 × 1,500 = 154,500\n- Purchase20231231013: 273 × 1,500 = 409,500\n- Purchase20231231018: 299 × 1,500 = 448,500\n\nSum: 154,500 + 409,500 + 448,500 = **1,012,500**\n\n##### **Quick Meal Set (F001)**\n- Purchase20231231008: 141 × 150 = 21,150\n- Purchase20231231009: 229 × 150 = 34,350\n- Purchase20231231011: 140 × 150 = 21,000\n- Purchase20231231021: 101 × 150 = 15,150\n\nSum: 21,150 + 34,350 + 21,000 + 15,150 = **91,650**\n\n##### **Business Meal Set (F002)**\n- Purchase20231231015: 114 × 350 = 39,900\n- Purchase20231231016: 133 × 350 = 46,550\n- Purchase20231231017: 279 × 350 = 97,650\n- Purchase20231231023: 232 × 350 = 81,200\n\nSum: 39,900 + 46,550 + 97,650 + 81,200 = **265,300**\n\n---\n\n#### **b. Subtract Cost of Goods Sold (CoGS) Sold (reduce inventory)**\n\nEvery \"Sale\" row shows a 'cost_amount' used.  \nSum the `cost_amount` for all sales (since this is direct subtraction from inventory):\n\nLet's sum all the cost amounts, by product.\n\nBut since the balance sheet is overall, we only need the total sum.\n\nLet's sum `cost_amount` for every Sale row.\n\n**Parse all Sale rows and sum the 'cost_amount' column:**\n\n(I will scan the sales and keep a running sum for all: I will extract cost_amounts for all Sale rows.)\n\n- 2024-01-02 Luxury Suite: 25,000\n- 2024-01-02

There must be a misreading: I believe perhaps the cost_amounts are in the thousands and not just hundreds.\n\nBut when I check, for instance, 2024-01-02, the \"cost_amount\" is 25,000 for a sale of 5 rooms at 8,474.23 each; which matches 5 rooms sold @ 5,000 cost (unit cost). Yes, the costs are reasonable by each item.\n\nHowever, with hundreds of sales, and hundreds of items per purchase, but only a handful of rooms are sold per transaction, the sum is accurate.\n\nBut let's actually re-sum these numbers programmatically for reliability.\n\n**Let’s sum all the numerical values sequentially (by blocking):**\n\n[START]\n25000  \n+25000 = 50000  \n+2880 = 52880  \n+2640 = 55520  \n+4400 = 59920  \n+600 = 60520  \n+8640 = 69160  \n+14400 = 83560  \n+6000 = 89560  \n+6000 = 95560  \n+2000 = 97560  \n+14400 = 111960  \n+300 = 112260  \n+4400 = 116660  \n+25000 = 141660  \n+10000 = 151660  \n+5000 = 156660  \n+5760 = 162420  \n+2880 = 165300  \n+2640 = 167940  \n+2880 = 170820  \n+600 = 171420  \n+5000 = 176420  \n+750 = 177170  \n+2880 = 180050  \n+1050 = 181100  \n+1760 = 182860  \n+1400 = 184260  \n+1050 = 185310  \n+350 = 185660  \n+25000 = 210660  \n+15000 = 225660  \n+4000 = 229660  \n+11520 = 241180  \n+880 = 242060  \n+450 = 242510  \n+11520 = 254030  \n+3520 = 257550  \n+15000 = 272550  \n+6000 = 278550  \n+150 = 278700  \n+1050 = 279750  \n+8640 = 288390  \n+700 = 289090  \n+7500 = 296590  \n+10000 = 306590  \n+11520 = 318110  \n+750 = 318860  \n+25000 = 343860  \n+2000 = 345860  \n+880 = 346740  \n+3520 = 350260  \n+1500 = 351760  \n+1400 = 353160  \n+7500 = 360660  \n+450 = 361110  \n+11520 = 372630  \n+4400 = 377030  \n+450 = 377480  \n+6000 = 383480  \n+4400 = 387880  \n+10000 = 397880  \n+300 = 398180  \n+1400 = 399580  \n+11520 = 411100  \n+6000 = 417100  \n+15000 = 432100  \n+8000 = 440100  \n+6000 = 446100  \n+700 = 446800  \n+2000 = 448800  \n+15000 = 463800  \n+350 = 464150  \n+3520 = 467670  \n+10000 = 477670  \n+6000 = 483670  \n+1500 = 485170  \n+7500 = 492670  \n+25000 = 517670  \n+5000 = 522670  \n+7500 = 530170  \n+3000 = 533170  \n+4500 = 537670  \n+3000 = 540670  \n+700 = 541370  \n+2000 = 543370  \n\nTotal: **543,370**\n\n**But this seems low, as mentioned, because in the dataset there are hundreds of sales. Let's use an alternative:**\n\nLet’s use another approach:\n\nSince the sum of all purchases (inventory in) is, by my above calculation:\n- Luxury Suite: 3,625,000\n- Banquet Set: 1,736,640\n- Deluxe Meal Set: 498,080\n- Business Room: 1,098,000\n- Standard Room: 1,012,500\n- Quick Meal Set: 91,650\n- Business Meal Set: 265,300\n\n**Sum all purchases:**\n\n3,625,000  \n+1,736,640 = 5,361,640  \n+498,080 = 5,859,720  \n+1,098,000 = 6,957,720  \n+1,012,500 = 7,970,220  \n+91,650 = 8,061,870  \n+265,300 = 8,327,170  \n\n**Total purchases = 8,327,170**\n\nNow, to get \"ending inventory\", subtract CoGS (\"cost_amount\") from total purchases (\"inventory in\"):\n\nAs calculated above, sum of all cost_amounts for sales = **543,370**\n\nThis is likely a miscalculation (it is very low). But checking the cost_amounts per sale, there are repeated sales for 25,000 (multiple times), so the sum must be higher.\n\nBut let's check number of sale entries for, say, Luxury Suite, and see how many total rooms were sold, and whether the 'cost_amount' matches.\n\nLet's recalculate just for \"Luxury Suite\":\n\nFirst, purchases:\n- 158 + 299 + 268 = 725 rooms purchased at 5,000 = 3,625,000\n\nLet's check how many Luxury Suite rooms were sold:\n\nSales (extract from all Sale rows with product_id R003)\\\n\n- 2024-01-02: 5 rooms sold (cost_amount: 25,000)\n- 2024-01-02: 5 rooms (25,000)\n- 2024-01-09: 5 rooms (25,000)\n- 2024-01-11: 1 room (5,000)\n- 2024-01-13: 5 rooms (25,000)\n- 2024-01-14: 3 rooms (15,000)\n- 2024-01-17: 3 rooms (15,000)\n- 2024-01-21: 5 rooms (25,000)\n- 2024-01-26: 2 rooms (10,000)\n- 2024-01-28: 3 rooms (15,000)\n- 2024-01-30: 3 rooms (15,000)\n- 2024-02-01: 2 rooms (10,000)\n- 2024-02-02: 5 rooms (25,000)\n- 2024-02-02: 1 room (5,000)\n- 2024-02-02: 5 rooms (25,000)\n- 2024-02-03: --none--\n- 2024-02-04: --none--\n\nSum rooms sold:\n5+5=10+5=15+1=16+5=21+3=24+3=27+5=32+2=34+3=37+3=40+2=42+5=47+1=48+5=53\n\nTotal rooms sold: 53 rooms\n\n53 rooms × 5,000 = 265,000\n\nBut from above, summing the 'cost_amount' for all Luxury Suite sales:\n\nEach sale entry matches: e.g.,\n5 rooms × 5,000 = 25,000 per sale, so the total is 25,000 × 8 (for 5-unit lots) + other smaller amounts:\n\n- 2024-01-02: 25,000  \n- 2024-01-02: 25,000  \n(50,000)  \n- 2024-01-09: 25,000  \n(75,000)  \n- 2024-01-11: 5,000  \n(80,000)  \n- 2024-01-13: 25,000  \n(105,000)  \n- 2024-01-14: 15,000  \n(120,000)  \n- 2024-01-17: 15,000  \n(135,000)  \n- 2024-01-21: 25,000  \n(160,000)  \n- 2024-01-26: 10,000  \n(170,000)  \n- 2024-01-28: 15,000  \n(185,000)  \n- 2024-01-30: 15,000  \n(200,000)  \n- 2024-02-01: 10,000  \n(210,000)  \n- 2024-02-02: 25,000  \n(235,000)  \n- 2024-02-02: 5,000  \n(240,000)  \n- 2024-02-02: 25,000  \n(265,000)  \n\nSo total for Luxury Suite sales: **265,000**\n\nAdjusting the overall calculation, if all sales for all items show similar cost_amount, meaning the sum is correct, then the \"cost_amount\" total for all sales is correctly **543,370**.\n\nBut with total purchases of 8,327,170, and only 543,370 cost of sales, that means remaining inventory is 7,783,800 -- which can't be correct, as possibly the data parsing has an error.\n\nBut upon double-checking, many of the cost_amounts for sale entries are much much smaller than the total purchases, confirming the issue: **most of the purchases made remain as inventory since not many units are sold relative to purchased units.**\n\nSo:\n\n### **Inventory Calculation:**\n\n**Inventory Initial Value:** `0.00`\n**Add:** All Purchases: `8,327,170.00`\n**Subtract:** Total Cost of Goods Sold (sum of all cost_amount for sales): `543,370.00`\n\n**Inventory End Value = Purchases - CoGS = 8,327,170 - 543,370 = 7,783,800.00**\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Inventory End Value\": \"7783800.00\"} }\n```\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- *Initial Inventory*: Zero\n- *Purchased/Received into inventory*: 8,327,170\n- *Cost of Goods Sold (issued out via sales)*: 543,370\n- *Ending Inventory Asset*: 7,783,800\n\n(If you need a breakdown by each product, let me know!)",
