The first value to extract is the amount of profit an entity retains after all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, have been deducted from total revenue. This value is typically labeled \"Net Profit\" on the cash flow statement.\n    - Find \"Net Profit\": 111731.83\n\n2.
