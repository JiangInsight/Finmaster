But for new business, can use ending balance only.  \n   If we use ending: 791,992.51 / 248,540.09 ≈ 3.19 (let's use this method for consistency given the sample).*\n\n**Final Numbers Formatted as Above:**  \n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: \"-1.33\"\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: \"0.21\"\n- Total Asset Turnover Ratio: \"0.04\"\n- Quick Ratio: \"0.37\"\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: \"-1.33\"\n- Return on Equity (ROE): \"0.69%\"\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: \"3.19\"\n```",
