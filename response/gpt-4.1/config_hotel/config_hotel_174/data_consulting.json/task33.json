Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities (end)\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,504,752.68 \n- Total Current Liabilities (end) = 3,389,719.66\n\nCalculation:  \n= -4,504,752.68 / 3,389,719.66  \n≈ -1.33\n\n---\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio  \n(Assuming \"Debt\" = Total Current Liabilities, as no long-term liabilities provided)  \n**Formula:**  \nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\n= -4,504,752.68 / 3,389,719.66  \n≈ -1.33\n\n---\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio  \n**Formula:**  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 504,930.00\n- Inventory: Jan 1 (begin) = 0; Feb 3 (end) = 7,869,940.00\n- Average Inventory = (0 + 7,869,940.00) / 2 = 3,934,970.00\n\nCalculation:  \n= 504,930.00 / 3,934,970.00  \n≈ 0.128\n\nBut in the example, when begin inventory is 0, average was just (0+end)/2. We'll keep as above.\n\nRounded to 3 decimals:  \n≈ 0.128\n\nBut in the reference example, only end inventory is considered when beginning is zero, so  \n= 504,930.00 / 7,869,940.00  \n≈ 0.064\n\n**Therefore, Inventory Turnover Ratio: 0.064**\n\n---\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities (end) = 3,389,719.66\n- Total Owner's Equity (end) = 16,111,731.83\n\n= 3,389,719.66 / 16,111,731.83  \n≈ 0.21\n\n---\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio  \n**Formula:**  \nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\n- Current Assets (end) = 9,122,854.19\n- Inventory (end) = 7,869,940.00\n- Current Liabilities (end) = 3,389,719.66\n\n= (9,122,854.19 - 7,869,940.00) / 3,389,719.66  \n= 1,252,914.19 / 3,389,719.66  \n≈ 0.37\n\nBut in the example, only cash + bank + receivables + interest receivable are included for quick assets:\n- Cash on Hand = 927,447.32\n- Bank Deposits = 71,662.08\n- Interest Receivable = 5,264.70\n- Accounts Receivable = 248,540.09\nTotal Quick Assets = 927,447.32 + 71,662.08 + 5,264.70 + 248,540.09 = 1,252,914.19\n\nQuick Ratio = 1,252,914.19 / 3,389,719.66 ≈ 0.37\n\nHowever, in your previous example, you got 1.54 for a similar calculation, but with lower liabilities proportionally. So 0.37 is the reasonable answer.\n\nBut for reference, if you use only (cash+bank+receivables+interest receivable) for quick assets, as per your example, that's what we have.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Current Ratio  \n**Formula:**  \nCurrent Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\n- Total Current Assets (end) = 9,122,854.19\n- Total Current Liabilities (end) = 3,389,719.66\n\n= 9,122,854.19 / 3,389,719.66  \n≈ 2.69\n\n---\n\n**Final Answers:**  \n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -1.33\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: -1.33\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio: 0.064\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.21\n- Quick Ratio: 0.37\n- Current Ratio: 2.69\n\n**[Note: In the solution, Quick Ratio rounded to 0.15 was likely a typographical error, but by formula and example, the correct value is 0.37.]**",
