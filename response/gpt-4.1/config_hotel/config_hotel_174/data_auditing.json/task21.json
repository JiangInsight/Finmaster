Thus, the original (correct) category should be \"Interest Receivables\" and the amount should be 132.5.\n- The \"recorded_type\" in the table for this row is \"Sales Expenses\" and the recorded amount is 147.5, both of which do not match the invoice.\n- All other fields are either missing or not clearly available in both sources, so we default those to None.\n- Thus, the fields with inconsistency are `recorded_type` (category) and `recorded_amount` (amount). The best estimate for the original value is derived from the reliable and regulated \"invoice\" field as per the instructions.",
