\"Initial Capital\" (the invoice is a single initial entry likely splitting into asset and bank/cash, not three distinct line items of full value).\n- For `Sale20240128083`, the invoice and all details indicate a \"Sale\", but the recorded_type says \"Purchase\".\n- For `Sale20240114022`, the invoice text and the fields are for a \"Sale\" yet the recorded_type is \"Administrative Expenses\", *and* the recorded tax amount is far too high given the transaction amountâ€”the correct tax per the invoice and numeric fields is $1233.85, not $20330.7.\n\nAll other transactions in your data appear internally consistent based on the fields and the invoice. The above represent all internal inconsistencies identified.",
