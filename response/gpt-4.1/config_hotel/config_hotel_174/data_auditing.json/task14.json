However, according to the \"invoice,\" the Fixed Assets should be the sum of the cash and bank deposit, i.e., 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000. This matches, so while three lines refer to the same id, there is no *internal* inconsistency here in the given extract, but just multiple representations of the same transaction. No correction needed (no explicit error).\n\n2. **Sale20240117028** and **Sale20240129086**: According to the risk_issues, the recorded quantity and payment/receipt_status are inconsistent with the reliable \"invoice\" text. Similarly, the total amount and tax correspond to a quantity of 2, but the line says 1.\n\n   For **Sale20240129086:**\n   - Invoice: “consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $1417.10, totaling $2834.20. … tax $141.71, total amount due $2692.49 … this transaction was unpaid.”\n   - Row: recorded_quantity = 1.0, recorded_amount = 1417.10, recorded_payment/receipt_status = Paid\n   - Correction: Should be quantity = 2.0, amount = 2834.20, payment/receipt_status = Unpaid.\n\n**For all other transactions in your sample, based on comparison between row fields and the reliably structured invoice text, there are no clear internal inconsistencies. Minor rounding errors or duplicate cash-to-bank transfer entries may exist, but they are not internal *field* inconsistencies requiring value correction.**",
