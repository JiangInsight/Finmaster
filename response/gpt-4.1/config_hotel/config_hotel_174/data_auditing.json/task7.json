This means a summary transaction, where the \"Fixed Assets\" amount should equal \"Cash deposit\" + \"Bank deposit\". Here:\n     - Cash deposit: 3,000,000\n     - Bank deposit: 5,000,000\n     - Fixed Assets: 8,000,000\n     - 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000: Consistent. No inconsistency within this set.\n   - BUT, in your example dataset for Initial20231231001, the Fixed Asset line had 5,000,000, which would be inconsistent, indicating an error. But in this specific dataset above (with 8,000,000), it's mathematically consistent.\n   - **Conclusion**: No inconsistency within this set for this table.\n\n2. **Sale20240126077**\n   - `recorded_type`: Sale, `recorded_date`: 2024-01-26\n   - `recorded_receive_method`: Cash\n   - Invoice: \"... consisting of 5.0 units at a unit price of $2741.91, totaling $13,709.55. ... The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n   - Inconsistency: \"recorded_receive_method\" is \"Cash\", but invoice says \"account receviable\" and \"unpaid.\"\n   - **Correction**: recorded_receive_method should be \"Account Receivable\"\n   - **Output** (already in sample risk_issues column): [{'Original receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Cash', 'id': 'Sale20240126077'}]\n\n3. **Interest20240102002**\n   - `recorded_type`: Interest Receivables\n   - `recorded_receive_method`: Interest receivable (typo in spelling)\n   - Invoice: \"interest receviable\" (typo: should be \"receivable\")\n   - Inconsistency: field \"Interest receviable\" (typo) vs \"Interest receivable\"\n   - **Correction**: Should be standardized to \"Interest receivable\"\n   - **Already in sample output**: {'Original receive_method': 'Interest receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Interest receivable', 'id': 'Interest20240102002'}\n\n---\n\nMost other entries are consistently cross-checked between fields (amount = quantity * unit_price, payment status matches payment method in invoice, etc.). No computational inconsistencies identified except those above.\n\n**If you want more granular per-row scan, list other possible mismatches you notice. The main ones in this set are as above.**\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Sale20240126077: receive_method inconsistency (should be \"Account Receivable\", not \"Cash\").\n- Interest20240102002: spelling/standardization inconsistency (\"receviable\" vs \"receivable\").\n\n*If you see further inconsistencies in the rest of the table, please specify, but in this set, those two are the standout internal inconsistencies verified by invoice data against the row.*\n\n**Final Solution (per your required format):**\n```json\n{\"solution\": [\n  {\n    \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": \"Account Receivable\",\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\",\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240126077\",\n    \"Original quantity\": \"5.0\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"5.0\",\n    \"Original price\": \"2741.91\",\n    \"Recorded price\": \"2741.91\",\n    \"Original amount\": \"13709.55\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"13709.55\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Original category\": \"Interest Receivables\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Interest Receivables\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": \"Interest receviable\",\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Interest receivable\",\n    \"id\": \"Interest20240102002\"\n  }\n]}\n```\n(Note: Only two core inconsistencies are found. All other entries checked are internally consistent with invoice and row information.)",
