Initial20231231001 (Fixed Assets)\n- There are three \"Initial\" entries. However, the \"Fixed Assets\" value here is $8,000,000.00 (recorded_amount) but the sum of \"Cash deposit\" ($3,000,000) and \"Bank deposit\" ($5,000,000) is also $8,000,000, suggesting the Fixed Assets row is correct. No internal inconsistency based on row fields, so this row is not actually inconsistent *internally* but may cause consistency issues across all rows with same id. Since per invoice, it says $8,000,000.00, this is not a row error.\n\n#### 2. Sale20240130057\n- Product: Chemical Product B (should have 2.0 units * $25021.15 = $50042.30) but recorded_amount is $49533.50.\n- \"invoice\" says: 3.0 units at $24766.75, totaling $74300.25, tax = $3715.01, cost = $60000, after_tax = $70585.24.\n- Fields: recorded_quantity is 2.0, recorded_unit_price 25021.15, recorded_amount 49533.50, tax 81724.53, after_tax 70585.24 (matches invoice), so these three fields are inconsistent.\n- Best estimate is the invoice is correct (as per prompt), so quantity should be 3.0, price 24766.75, amount 74300.25, tax 3715.01.\n- Output as above.\n\n#### 3. Sale20240202101\n- Product: Business Meal Set. \"invoice\" says 2.0 units at 577.39, totaling 1154.78, tax 57.74, after_tax 1097.04.\n- Fields: recorded_quantity is 1.0, price 668.95, amount 577.39, tax 970.7, after_tax 1097.04 (matches invoice).\n- Fields inconsistent with invoice and with each other.\n- Correct = invoice: quantity 2.0, price 577.39, amount 1154.78, tax 57.74.\n- Output as above.\n\n---\n\nIf more inconsistencies like the ones above exist, include them as additional dictionaries in the list.  \nIn this dataset, these are the internal inconsistencies readily found as per cross-checking invoice field versus numeric fields.",
