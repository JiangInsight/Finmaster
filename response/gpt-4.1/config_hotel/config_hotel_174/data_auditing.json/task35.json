Initial20231231001\n- This transaction appears three times with the same ID but different \"recorded_type\": \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\". \n- **Problem:** The sum of \"Cash deposit\" (3,000,000.00) and \"Bank deposit\" (5,000,000.00) is 8,000,000.00, which matches the \"Fixed Assets\" amount. But according to invoice text, three separate invoices of 3,000,000.00, 5,000,000.00 and 8,000,000.00 were issued, but only one row here mismatches row with 8,000,000.00 amount.\n- **Correction:** According to the invoice (and also the pattern of earlier data), this looks like a duplicate data entry problem -- likely, Fixed Assets was assigned the sum of the two deposits instead of their parallel, singular lines. However, since each invoice does appear in narration, and all amounts add correctly, this is probably intended, but would need adjustment in actual bookkeeping, aligning with the sum nature (needs flagging in audit).\n- **Inconsistent field(s):** \"recorded_amount\"\n- **Estimate:** Based on invoice text, \"Fixed Assets\" should have amount 5,000,000.00 (to agree with the other entries; sum of deposits), but the presented data puts 8,000,000.00.\n\nBut, since the invoice says \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Fixed Assets, totaling $8,000,000.00.\", it's plausible as one invoice.\n\n### 2. Sale20240107022\n- \"recorded_type\" is \"Financial Expenses\", but invoice says \"On January 07, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $1264.83, totaling $1264.83.\"\n- \"recorded_date\" is 2024-01-30, narration says 2024-01-07, \"recorded_amount\" is 0.0, narration and invoice say amount is 1264.83.\n- \"recorded_quantity\" is 0, narration says 1.\n- \"recorded_unit_price\" is 1177.28, narration says 1264.83.\n- \"recorded_type\" should be \"Sale\", not \"Financial Expenses\".\n- Multiple fields do not align with invoice text.\n- \"recorded_amount\" is 1507.34, invoice says 1264.83.\n\nThis is a clear case of mis-entry. This row is probably the result of a data corruption or misassignment.\n\n---\n\nAll other rows are consistent (amount = quantity Ã— unit price, type matches narration, etc.), or are consistent with invoice narrative, or have no conflicting evidence. If you want ALL inconsistencies, only these two are flagged as major, per your example format and logic.",
