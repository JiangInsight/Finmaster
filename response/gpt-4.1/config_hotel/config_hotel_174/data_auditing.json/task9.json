For the \"Initial20231231001\" entries, the sum referenced for \"Fixed Assets\" on the invoice (fixed asset part) is $8000000.00, which matches the \"recorded_amount\". However, cross-reference to \"Cash deposit\" ($3000000) and \"Bank deposit\" ($5000000) for the same id implies the fixed assets are $8000000, which matches. There is no inconsistency in \"recorded_amount\". No internal error was found here for \"Fixed Assets\" line, but these three lines seem to sum together, and all are listed with corresponding amounts, so no correction.\n\n2. For Sale20240126076, the invoice states a tax amount of $1296.88, but the recorded tax is $23298.73. This is an internal error: the tax is far too large, likely a typo (the tax should be the amount × (1-tax rate), and all analogous invoices/totals in this data match). Other calculated fields (here: 25937.58 - 3.0 * 8645.86 = 0) confirm sales price and recorded amount agree; the invoice tax value of $1296.88 matches the pattern across similar sales and is thus more reliable. All other fields match.\n\nThus, the detected internal error for id \"Sale20240126076\" is:\n\n- Tax: Recorded=23298.73, Correct=1296.88 (per invoice context and arithmetic).\n\n**Notes:**\n- All other entries either match or, where the invoice amount matches the computed value from the other fields, no error is present. If errors are specifically required for all three \"Initial20231231001\" lines (Cash deposit/Bank deposit/Fixed Assets), report only if the total doesn't add up or an amount mismatch happens, but in this case, they are correct by the invoice.\n- For completeness, one could add the \"Sale20240108014\" example as well, but it does not occur in this dataset (provided “risk_issues” on that row).\n- If you require only the mismatched rows (not rows where there’s no error), Sale20240126076 is the only error in this data. \n\n**Short version:**  \nOnly Sale20240126076 (tax error) is inconsistent in this dataset and needs correction; the rest, including the \"Initial\" opening balances, are internally consistent per invoices. \n\nIf you need strictly only affected rows:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n  \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\",\n  \"Original date\": \"2024-01-26\",\n  \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-26\",\n  \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n  \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n  \"Original payment_method\": null,\n  \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n  \"Original quantity\": \"3.0\",\n  \"Recorded quantity\": \"3.0\",\n  \"Original price\": \"8645.86\",\n  \"Recorded price\": \"8645.86\",\n  \"Original receive_method\": null,\n  \"Recorded receive_method\": null,\n  \"Original amount\": \"25937.58\",\n  \"Recorded amount\": \"25937.58\",\n  \"Original tax\": \"1296.88\",\n  \"Recorded tax\": \"23298.73\",\n  \"Original profit\": null,\n  \"Recorded profit\": null,\n  \"Original Preparer\": null,\n  \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n  \"Original Approver\": null,\n  \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n  \"id\": \"Sale20240126076\"\n}}\n```\nIf reporting all rows with an error—here, it's just that row.",
