But in the **examples** (see above), typically the *Fixed Assets* line is supposed to be $5,000,000, while the sum of cash + bank should equal fixed asset value entry.\n   - Since \"invoice\" is most reliable, and in this data it matches 8,000,000.00, the error (if any) is in *other* tables, not this one. **Hence, skip this entry.**\n\n   Correction: There is NO error if all invoice fields and amounts match. So skip.\n\n2. **For transaction id = Sale20240202099**:\n   - The entry: 3.0 units * 551.33 = 1,653.99 recorded_amount; but the invoice says \"On February 02, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 4.0 units at a unit price of $551.33, totaling $2,205.32. The cost amount...tax ... amount due $2,095.05...\"\n   - Therefore, the recorded_quantity is 3.0, but the invoice/standardized record says 4.0, and the recorded_amount is too low (should be $2,205.32).\n   - As in the example solution, this is marked as an inconsistency.\n\nThus, the only relevant inconsistency here is for the sale on 2024-02-02 with id Sale20240202099.\n\n3. **Checking for any other field mismatches**:\n   - Scanned all entries for similar mismatches between invoice and recorded fields.\n   - All purchase/sale 'amount', 'quantity', etc., entries match their 'invoice' description except for Sale20240202099.\n\n**Therefore, the only answer needed is for Sale20240202099, matching the sample solution style.**\n\nAlso, per your example, if you want to capture the mismatch for an \"Original\" (invoice) vs \"Recorded\" (table) for every quantity/amount field, you can report both \"Original quantity\" (4.0) and \"Recorded quantity\" (3.0), same for \"amount\" \"$2,205.32\" and \"$1,653.99\". For the other fields, if not mismatched, leave as null.\n\n**Note:** The 'id' \"Initial20231231001\" actually does not display an inconsistency in this data since the amounts for entry and invoice match for each row.\n\n*If you want to strictly follow the format of your example (for quantity error), the above is the only issue in this dataset.*",
