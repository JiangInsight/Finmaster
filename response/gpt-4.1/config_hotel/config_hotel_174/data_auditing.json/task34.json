The cost amount for this transaction was $3000.00, with a tax amount of $262.13, leading to a total amount due of $4980.51. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- But the DATA for `Sale20240125073` shows: \n    - category/type is \"Financial Expenses\" instead of Sale.\n    - date is \"2024-02-06\" instead of 2024-01-25.\n    - quantity is \"1\" instead of \"2.0\".\n    - unit price is \"3117.14\" instead of \"2621.32\".\n    - total amount is \"2621.32\" instead of \"5242.64\".\n    - tax amount is \"4531.39\" instead of \"262.13\".\n    - payment/receipt_status is Paid in both.\n    - payment method/Cash, receive_method/Cash, profit $2242.64 in both (though may be accidental).\n    - Preparer and Approver info missing in both.\n    \n- Invoices are more reliable and detailed. Therefore, the correct values should match the invoice text.\n- This answer maps each field's correct (Original) and incorrectly recorded values as required.",
