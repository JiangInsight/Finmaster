For id `Initial20231231001`, there are three entries for the same id and date:\n   - Cash deposit: 3000000.0\n   - Bank deposit: 5000000.0\n   - Fixed Assets: 8000000.0 (should be cash+bank, matches)\n   - All agree given the totals, so **no actual internal inconsistency** for the Fixed Assets entry. (But the amount is not the sum of the two above. However, often the sum of initial assets is Fixed Assets, not the sum, so this is not a classic contradiction.)\n\n2. For id `Sale20240106019`:\n   - recorded_type: Depreciation\n   - but the invoice and all other data describe a \"Sale\" (invoice: \"On January 06, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale ...\")\n   - recorded_category should be \"Sale\".\n   - recorded_product_name: Business Room; recorded_quantity: 3.0; recorded_unit_price: 2683.13; but in invoice the unit price is 2709.19, and the amount is 8127.57 not 9378.07 (recorded)\n   - So, category, amount, and unit price are inconsistent with the invoice (which, as per instructions, is more reliable).\n   - Payment and receive methods are \"Paid\" and \"Cash\" in all, so that's not an error.\n   - The correct category should be \"Sale\", correct unit price 2709.19, amount 8127.57.\n\n*No other classic internal error is present in the given batch, except these two relevant ones, as nearly all other entries match with their invoices and descriptions.*\n\nThus, the list contains only the two issues above clearly. If the Fixed Assets' entry is not an error under your rules, remove -- otherwise, keep if considered an internal error. Most likely, only the Sale20240106019 is a clear-cut data error, matching the previous example. But since the prompt requests to check for errors, listing the initial asset composition if you wish to focus only on strict errors, only submit the Sale20240106019 one. Otherwise, include both as above.",
