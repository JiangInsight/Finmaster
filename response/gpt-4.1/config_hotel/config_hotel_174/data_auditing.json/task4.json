Should be three separate transactions or only Fixed Assets OR the Fixed Asset line should not have amount = 8,000,000.0, but 0 if just a classification. However, since the invoice says 'an invoice was issued for a Fixed Assets, totaling $8000000.00.' the correct value for these three lines should be one entry for 8,000,000.0, not three. Best estimate: Only one transaction with type 'Fixed Assets', amount 8,000,000.0. The 'Cash deposit' and 'Bank deposit' lines are suspect.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Original category\": \"Administrative Expenses\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Administrative Expenses\",\n    \"Original date\": \"2024-01-13\",\n    \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-13\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n    \"Original payment_method\": \"Cash\",\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Account Payable\",\n    \"Original quantity\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"\",\n    \"Original price\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded price\": \"\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"\",\n    \"Original amount\": \"524.06\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"524.06\",\n    \"Original tax\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded tax\": \"\",\n    \"Original profit\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded profit\": \"\",\n    \"Original Preparer\": \"Supervisor\",\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": \"Supervisor\",\n    \"Original Approver\": \"Director\",\n    \"Recorded Approver\": \"Director\",\n    \"id\": \"Expense20240113001\"\n  }\n]}\n```\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Initial20231231001**\n    - Three lines share this transaction id and date, with different types: \"Cash deposit\" ($3,000,000), \"Bank deposit\" ($5,000,000), and \"Fixed Assets\" ($8,000,000).\n    - Invoices state: \"an invoice was issued for a Cash deposit...$3,000,000.00\", \"Bank deposit...$5,000,000.00\", \"Fixed Assets...$8,000,000.00.\"\n    - Can't have three full amounts for the same transaction ID; likely, the intended bookkeeping is *either* two asset/liab. flows (cash+bank) summing to fixed assets OR one transaction for the Fixed Asset total.\n    - Presume, because $3M + $5M = $8M, that only the Fixed Asset total is correct per the invoice, and the other two should not be separate entries.\n    - Internal inconsistency: three different categories and amounts for the same id.\n\n2. **Expense20240113001**\n    - Two lines share this id, both for \"Administrative Expenses,\" same date, similar fields. \n    - The first line (Staff=Supervisor, Approver=Director, Paid, Payment Method=Account Payable).\n    - Invoice says \"The payment_method...cash, and this transaction was paid.\", but recorded_payment_method='Account Payable'.\n    - This mismatch is also noted in the example for how to report. Correct value should be “Cash”; recorded was “Account Payable”.\n\n**Note on format:** \n- Only true numeric/data field mismatches are returned; other lines/transactions appear internally consistent by field with their supporting invoice. \n- If you want only line-per-error, you may split the initial $8M issue into its three lines (listing each as an error). Here it's summarized for conciseness.\n\nIf you prefer the output as a flat dict for each mismatch, let me know and I can rewrite as an array of JSON objects, each with only the error case.",
