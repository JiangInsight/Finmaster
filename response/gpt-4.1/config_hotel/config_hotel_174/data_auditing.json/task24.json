Initial20231231001 (\"Fixed Assets\", 2023-12-31, 8000000.0)\n- There are three \"Initial20231231001\" entries (Cash deposit 3,000,000.00; Bank deposit 5,000,000.00; Fixed Assets 8,000,000.00), all on the same date and with different amounts.\n- The sum of \"Cash deposit\" and \"Bank deposit\" is 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000. \n- The \"Fixed Assets\" should represent the total of cash+bank (used to purchase fixed assets), which is 8,000,000. \n- All amounts are arithmetically consistent and agree with the invoices. No discrepancy.\n- So, no real error here — just unusual to have three entries with the same id but makes sense in context (opening balances). Thus, I include for completeness.\n\n### 2. Sale20240120060 (\"Sale\", 2024-01-20, 2801.09)\n- Product: Business Meal Set F002, 4 units, unit price 450.89, recorded_amount 2801.09, but the invoice says: \"... consisting of 4.0 units at a unit price of $561.02, totaling $2244.08.\"\n- The correct calculation should be 4 * 561.02 = 2244.08 (matches invoice, reliable).\n- The database lists unit price of 450.89 and an amount of 2801.09, which is 450.89 * 4 = 1803.56 so the recorded_amount does not match either. Invoice indicates the correct values. \n- Therefore:\n    - recorded_unit_price should be 561.02, not 450.89\n    - recorded_amount should be 2244.08, not 2801.09\n\n**Other rows**:  \n- All other transactions match — for each sale/purchase the quantity * unit price = amount, and invoice values agree with those calculated amounts.  \n- The only clear instance of a mismatch is Sale20240120060.  \n- Many entries have nulls/missing data for payment_method, receive_method, approver/preparer etc., but invoices confirm their absence (i.e., are not necessarily errors).\n- There are repeated \"Cash to bank transfer\" ids (Transfer...), but they're consistent (just batch postings).\n\nSo the main internal inconsistency is in Sale20240120060 (and, potentially, the triple initial entry is worth noting as non-error). \n\n**Final answer is as above.**",
