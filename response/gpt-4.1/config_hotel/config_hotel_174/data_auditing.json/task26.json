However, since \"amount\" matches the sum, there's no mathematical inconsistency. But if comparing patterns to other examples, sometimes these three entries are used to cross-validate, so this is included for completeness.\n\n2. **Sale20240104009:**\n   - Invoice text says: \"On January 04, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 5.0 units at a unit price of $7562.06, totaling $37810.30...\"\n   - The table in \"recorded_amount\" is $41206.34, which does not match the invoice total, nor does it match the product of 5 x 7562.06 = $37810.30.\n   - Also, \"recorded_type\" is \"Financial Expenses\" instead of the invoice's \"Sale\", and the \"recorded_date\" is 2024-02-02 instead of the 2024-01-04 shown in the invoice.\n   - This is an apparent data entry error, so we output the full set of mismatches for all fields that don't match invoice.\n\nNo other clear internal inconsistencies are present in this snippet (as the rest either reconcile or do not show conflicting/overwritten fields).\n\n**If you need full list of errors for every inconsistency throughout the table, please clarify. These are the uniquely detectable mismatches from the snippet provided following the example style.**",
