Initial20231231001 (Fixed Assets Row)\n- There is a potential inconsistency: the sum of Cash deposit (3,000,000) and Bank deposit (5,000,000) matches the third row's Fixed Assets amount (8,000,000), but this reflects the underlying transaction structure, not an error within this row itself.\n- **Conclusion:** No internal row inconsistency; just underlying accounting logic.\n\n### 2. Sale20240114043\n- **Invoice says:** On January 14, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, 3 units @ $1192.01, total $3576.03, tax $178.8, after-tax $3397.23, cost $2640.0.\n- **Recorded data:**  \n  - recorded_type: Financial Expenses **(should be Sale)**\n  - recorded_date: 2024-01-23 **(should be 2024-01-14)**\n  - recorded_unit_price: 1362.98 **(should be 1192.01)**\n  - recorded_amount: 4447.69 **(should be 3576.03)**\n  - recorded_tax_amount: 3322.94 **(should be 178.8)**\n  - recorded_after_tax_amount: 3397.23 **(matches invoice)**\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  - Category, date, price, amount, and tax are inconsistent with the invoice (which is more reliable).\n  - All other fields match or are neutral.\n\n### Other Rows\n- **No further internal inconsistencies found** in the sample supplied. Most other rows that could appear duplicated or odd (such as the triple Initial20231231001 entries) are consistent within each row; they may reflect underlying accounting double entries rather than row-entry errors.\n\n**Summary Output:**  \n- Only two entries have inconsistencies that can be clearly corroborated with the invoice as the ground truth:  \n  1. Sale20240114043 (multiple key mismatches)\n  2. The Fixed Assets row in the opening balance (Initial20231231001) is not actually inconsistent on the row level per instructions.\n\n**If you want only rows with clear data entry mismatches (per sample),** the answer would actually be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": [\n  {\n    \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Financial Expenses\",\n    \"Original date\": \"2024-01-14\",\n    \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-23\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n    \"Original payment_method\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": \"\",\n    \"Original quantity\": \"3.0\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"3.0\",\n    \"Original price\": \"1192.01\",\n    \"Recorded price\": \"1362.98\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n    \"Original amount\": \"3576.03\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"4447.69\",\n    \"Original tax\": \"178.8\",\n    \"Recorded tax\": \"3322.94\",\n    \"Original profit\": \"936.03\",\n    \"Recorded profit\": \"936.03\",\n    \"Original Preparer\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": \"\",\n    \"Original Approver\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded Approver\": \"\",\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240114043\"\n  }\n]}\n```",
