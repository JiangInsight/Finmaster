For Initial20231231001:\n    - There are three entries for the same transaction ID with different recorded_type: \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\".\n    - The invoices for the amounts $3,000,000.00 (Cash deposit) and $5,000,000.00 (Bank deposit) show that these are assets received, but the sum ($8,000,000) is the total \"Fixed Assets\" amount.\n    - Judging by the invoice wording, the main category should be \"Fixed Assets\", and the \"Cash deposit\" and \"Bank deposit\" are components of this initial fixed asset capitalization (likely a split between bank and cash, together summed as 8,000,000).\n    - Therefore, the entries for \"Cash deposit\" and \"Bank deposit\" should have \"Fixed Assets\" as the original category, not just \"Cash deposit\" or \"Bank deposit\", to align with the invoice's standardized nature.\n\n2. For Sale20240127079:\n    - The row has \"Financial Expenses\" as the category, but the invoice summary and fields reflect a Sale transaction of a \"Quick Meal Set\".\n    - In the table, the recorded quantity is 2, but the invoice summary says \"3.0 units\", and the total amount should be 781.17 (3 × 260.39), but \"recorded_amount\" is 520.78 (2 × 260.39).\n    - Therefore, the correct original category should be \"Sale\", quantity \"3.0\", and amount \"781.17\".\n\n**Key points:**\n- \"invoice\" field is the standard of truth.\n- Duplicate/alternative asset entries for initial capital: All should match the category on the invoice line (\"Fixed Assets\").\n- For the sale/expense mismatch: If the invoice says \"Sale\" and the record says \"Financial Expenses\", plus quantity mismatch, that's an internal inconsistency.\n- Other fields without discrepancy (date, payment/receipt_status, etc.) are left as-is unless otherwise noted.\n\nIf more specific fields need to be included for each case, let me know!",
