Initial20231231001 Inconsistency (Fixed Assets Row)\n- There are three entries with the same ID (`Initial20231231001`) but with different types and amounts: Cash deposit (3M), Bank deposit (5M), Fixed Assets (here, 8M).\n- According to the INVOICE: \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Fixed Assets, totaling $8000000.00.\"\n- The \"recorded_amount\" and the invoice amount match, but it is inconsistent for one transaction ID to have three forms/categories with different amounts. Normally, initial capital entries must reconcile.\n- Here, the bank deposit + cash deposit = fixed assets (3+5=8M). This is correct, so there is actually *no error* in amount; it's a redundant initial entry pattern, allowed in some setups.\n- **No correction required, but note that the initial entries must be cross-referenced; all amounts add up.**\n\n### 2. Sale20240109027 Date Discrepancy\n- Recorded date is \"2024-01-10\", but invoice says \"On January 09, 2024, an invoice was issued...\"\n- So, recorded_date â‰  invoice_date.\n- All other fields match the invoice.\n- Correction: The correct date should be \"2024-01-09\" per the invoice.\n- **Field**: recorded_date\n- **Original**: 2024-01-09\n- **Recorded**: 2024-01-10\n\n### 3. Expense20240129001 Date Discrepancy\n- Similar to above: recorded_date is \"2024-02-14\", but invoice refers to \"On January 29, 2024...\"\n- The correct date is \"2024-01-29\" by invoice.\n- **Field**: recorded_date\n- **Original**: 2024-01-29\n- **Recorded**: 2024-02-14\n\n---\n\n**Only two genuine inconsistencies present in the given data (besides multi-row initial capital which is pattern-level rather than a strict error):**\n- Sale20240109027 (recorded_date mismatch)\n- Expense20240129001 (recorded_date mismatch)\n\nAll other entries match between their fields and the invoice descriptions. For completeness, we have included the Fixed Assets as a pattern confirmation; if you want only strict inconsistencies, only #2 and #3 above would be returned in your template.
