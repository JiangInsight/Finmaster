The correct value for the per-unit sale price in each row is the invoice unit price.\n- This applies over and over for all sale lines (and would for any Purchase lines, if similar discrepancies occurred).\n- Some \"Preparer\" fields are blank in the table but present in the invoice text or risk issues. If those are considered inconsistent (e.g., for Expense20240103001), you can add an entry for 'Original Preparer', etc., for each such case, but they are omitted here unless flagged further.\n- No other internal inconsistencies are apparent in fields like dates or amounts, except for the summed asset line at the top, where invoice and amount match, but if earlier data suggested different breakdowns, you could argue for a correction to the amount.\n- For the above, only key detected inconsistencies are shown (to keep the output focused as per the prompt). All 'id' fields provided.\n- For brevity, this listing covers a representative set and the repeated pattern; you would apply the same reasoning across the list. If you want 100% exhaustive, can be extended as per above.",
