The sum of Cash + Bank = $8,000,000, matching Fixed Assets. No actual inconsistency; amounts correspond (double-check shows correct total). **No changes needed – output shown for completeness.**\n\n2. **Sale20240126078:**\n   - According to the invoice: \"On January 26, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 4.0 units at a unit price of $8888.32, totaling $35553.28. The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $1777.66, leading to a total amount due of $33775.62. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n   - But in the data: recorded_amount = 43269.13 (should be 4 × 8888.32 = 35553.28), payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\" (invoice says paid), receive_method = \"Account Receivable\" (invoice says cash), profit = 15553.28 (should be 35553.28 - 20000 = 15553.28, so this is fine).\n   - So, correct values should be: payment/receipt_status = \"Paid\", receive_method = \"Cash\", recorded_amount = \"35553.28\".\n\n**Note:** Only output rows with a clear discrepancy; the rest are omitted for brevity. If you want to see more, e.g. about the \"Initial\" entry, adjust accordingly, but usually you'd only report actual errors.",
