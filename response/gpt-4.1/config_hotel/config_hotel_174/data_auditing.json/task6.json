The other two are inconsistent for the same transaction ID. But since you asked for entry-level inconsistency, the actual inconsistency is that the transaction ID is reused for three fundamentally different entries, which in a well-kept system should not happen.\n   - However, based on the invoice, the correct amount for Fixed Assets under this ID is $8,000,000.\n\n2. **Sale20240128084 (Sale)**\n   - This row: amount = 4 Ã— 6629.8 = 26519.2 (but total shows 27645.72), in the risk_issues footnote: \"Original price: 6911.43, Recorded price: 6629.8\".\n   - The invoice in the notes also lists: \"... consisting of 4.0 units at a unit price of $6911.43, totaling $27645.72.\"\n   - **Correction:** The correct unit price according to the invoice should be $6911.43, not $6629.8. The total amount is correct as per invoice, but the \"recorded_unit_price\" is inconsistent with invoice and the computed value.\n\n---\n\n**Other rows checked for internal inconsistencies:**\n- **Sale20240125044** has an issue: Original price $24990.50, Recorded price $24944.5, as per \"risk_issues\" field, but that inconsistency and solution is already illustrated in your example, so it's not included again.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The above two case entries show detected internal inconsistencies based on the reliable invoice evidence for those transactions. Other rows were verified or did not present similar explicit, provable discrepancies with \"best estimate\" corrections possible from the other fields in the row and the invoice.",
