                        "content": "Let's solve step by step.\n\n## 1. What are \"Total Liabilities\" on the Balance Sheet?\n\n**Liabilities** are debts/obligations. From the transactions, typical business current liabilities include:\n- **Accounts Payable:** Supplier invoices not yet paid (usually: Purchases with \"Unpaid\" and payment method \"Account Payable\")\n- **Interest Payables, Other Payables, Short-term/Long-term Loans, etc.:** Not obviously present here\n- **(Exclude):** Paid purchases, all expenses, depreciation, etc.—already paid, not liabilities.\n- **(EXCLUDE)** Account/Interest Receivables: these are **ASSETS**, not liabilities.\n\n## 2. What are the Initial Liabilities?\n\nLook for lines with id starting with \"Initial...\", check if any represent liabilities (rare, mostly asset balances like bank/cash/fixed assets).\n\n**In the data:**\n| id                 | type         | ... | amount    |\n|--------------------|--------------|-----|-----------|\n| Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | ... | 3,000,000 |\n| Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | ... | 5,000,000 |\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | ... | 8,000,000 |\n=> **These are all assets. No initial liabilities recorded.**\n\n## 3. Find \"Unpaid\" Purchases (Account Payable)\n\nWe need to sum all **Purchases** where\n- \"payment/receipt_status\" = \"Unpaid\"\n- \"payment_method\" = \"Account Payable\"\n\nLet's go through all such purchases:\n\n### Purchases with Unpaid & Account Payable\n\nLet's extract and sum:\n\n| id              | amount    | payment/receipt_status | payment_method    |\n|-----------------|-----------|-----------------------|-------------------|\n| Purchase20231231002 | 80,500    | Unpaid                | Account Payable   |\n| Purchase20231231003 | 342,000   | Unpaid                | Account Payable   |\n| Purchase20231231006 | 406,000   | Unpaid                | Account Payable   |\n| Purchase20231231007 | 137,280   | Unpaid                | Account Payable   |\n| Purchase20231231012 | 288,000   | Unpaid                | Account Payable   |\n| Purchase20231231013 | 103,600   | Unpaid                | Account Payable   |\n| Purchase20231231015 | 132,880   | Unpaid                | Account Payable   |\n| Purchase20231231016 | 665,280   | Unpaid                | Account Payable   |\n| Purchase20231231017 | 230,560   | Unpaid                | Account Payable   |\n| Purchase20231231018 | 316,500   | Unpaid                | Account Payable   |\n| Purchase20231231020 | 299,520   | Unpaid                | Account Payable   |\n| Purchase20231231021 | 348,000   | Unpaid                | Account Payable   |\n\nTotal = sum of all above\n\nLet's do the sum:\n\n- 80,500\n- 342,000\n- 406,000\n- 137,280\n- 288,000\n- 103,600\n- 132,880\n- 665,280\n- 230,560\n- 316,500\n- 299,520\n- 348,000\n\nLet's add:\n\n1. 80,500 + 342,000 = 422,500\n2. + 406,000 = 828,500\n3. + 137,280 = 965,780\n4. + 288,000 = 1,253,780\n5. + 103,600 = 1,357,380\n6. + 132,880 = 1,490,260\n7. + 665,280 = 2,155,540\n8. + 230,560 = 2,386,100\n9. + 316,500 = 2,702,600\n10. + 299,520 = 3,002,120\n11. + 348,000 = 3,350,120\n\n**Sum: 3,350,120**\n\n## 4. Are there any other unpaid amounts?\n\n- Purchases \"Unpaid\" with another payment method, e.g., \"Bank Transfer\": Not a liability unless noted as unpaid (but the bank transfer method is paired with \"Paid\" in the data, so safe to skip).\n\n## 5. Are unpaid expenses/other transactions present?\n\nScan for any \"Expense\" lines with \"Unpaid\" status—none shown; all are \"Paid\".\n\n## 6. Are any principal/interest loan payables in the data? (NO)\n\nAll \"Interest Receivables\" are marked as \"Unpaid\" but these are **assets** (the company expects to receive, not pay).\n\n## 7. So, what is the end balance of Total Liabilities?\n\nTotal Liabilities End Value = 3,350,120.00\n\n## 8. Initial value: As above, **there is no initial liability**, so\n\nTotal Liabilities Initial Value = 0.00\n\n---\n\n**Final output per instruction:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', 'Total Liabilities End Value': '3350120.00'} }\n```",
