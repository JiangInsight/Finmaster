What is required?\nWe are to compute the **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable** for the cash flow statement based on the provided transaction list.\n\nThis is calculated as:\n> **(Accounts Payable at period end) - (Accounts Payable at period start)**\n\nWhere:\n- Accounts Payable at period start: The sum of accounts payable on the initial balance sheet (“unpaid” purchases, via “Account Payable”).\n- Accounts Payable at period end: The same, as of end of period.\n\nSince this is only the January 2024 entries above, let’s see:\n\n## 2. Find Account Payable at Start of Period\n\n### Find all UNPAID purchases with \"Account Payable\" or similar at/before 2023-12-31\n\nLet's look for purchases with:\n- payment/receipt_status == \"Unpaid\"\n- payment_method == \"Account Payable\"\n- date/recorded_date BEFORE or ON 2023-12-31\n\n#### Extract all such purchases:\n\n| id                  | date         | payment/receipt_status | payment_method    | amount    |\n|---------------------|--------------|------------------------|-------------------|-----------|\n| Purchase20231231002 | 2023-12-31   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable   | 80,500    |\n| Purchase20231231003 | 2023-12-31   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable   | 342,000   |\n| Purchase20231231006 | 2023-12-31   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable   | 406,000   |\n| Purchase20231231007 | 2023-12-31   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable   | 137,280   |\n| Purchase20231231012 | 2023-12-31   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable   | 288,000   |\n| Purchase20231231013 | 2023-12-31   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable   | 103,600   |\n| Purchase20231231015 | 2023-12-31   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable   | 132,880   |\n| Purchase20231231016 | 2023-12-31   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable   | 665,280   |\n| Purchase20231231017 | 2023-12-31   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable   | 230,560   |\n| Purchase20231231018 | 2023-12-31   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable   | 316,500   |\n| Purchase20231231020 | 2023-12-31   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable   | 299,520   |\n| Purchase20231231021 | 2023-12-31   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable   | 348,000   |\n\n- First purchase (Purchase20231231001: 680,000 paid, not unpaid) – skip.\n- Others (“Paid” OR payment_method is not Account Payable) – skip.\n\nNow let’s sum these up:\n\n**80,500**  \n+ **342,000**  \n+ **406,000**  \n+ **137,280**  \n+ **288,000**  \n+ **103,600**  \n+ **132,880**  \n+ **665,280**  \n+ **230,560**  \n+ **316,500**  \n+ **299,520**  \n+ **348,000**  \n= **3,350,120**\n\nSo, starting Accounts Payable at period start (2023-12-31): **3,350,120**\n\n## 3. Accounts Payable at End of Period\n\nNow, at 2024-01-31 (end). Are there new purchases on AP? Are any of the above paid during January? Let's check:\n\n**First, check for additional 2024-01 \"Unpaid\"/AP purchases:**  \nLooking at all purchases, ALL “2023-12-31” (the original 12) still as above.\n\nI see NO “Purchase” transactions with payment/receipt_status == \"Unpaid\" AND payment_method == \"Account Payable\" in January 2024.  \n(There are “Expense” lines, but no *purchases* that would add to AP.) Similarly, “Fixed Asset” entries are all “Paid”; ignore.\n\nSo, No new purchases on AP during January.\n\n**Now, were any of these APs paid during January?**\n\nCheck if any of the previously unpaid purchases (above) were paid during January.  \nIn the list, for a given supplier and amount, if a transaction with “Paid” “Account Payable” or “Bank Transfer” matches the same supplier and amount, that purchase would be considered paid and thus should decrease AP.\n\nLet’s cross-check:\n\nI found **NO** “Purchase” transactions with “Paid” and matching exact dates/amounts/supplier in January – nearly all purchases are dated 2023-12-31 and have their payment_status as originally “Unpaid” or “Paid”.\n\nAssuming no explicit “payment of AP” transactions in January (sometimes there might be entries like “Payment to Supplier X, via Account Payable” – but not shown).\n\nReview “Expense” or other outflows for “Account Payable” as method:\n\n- All “Expense” records use “Cash.”\n- All “Transfer” and “Fixed Asset” use bank.\n- Purchases with “Paid” in Jan are for “Cash” or “Bank Transfer,” and are dated only “2023-12-31” (i.e., as above).  \n- It's possible that AP payment isn’t entered as a separate transaction, but as a direct “Paid” on purchases; But in this dataset, ALL “Unpaid” purchases remain “Unpaid.”\n\n**Bottom line: No AP was paid down; all existing AP still remains.**\n\n## 4. Calculation\n\nSo:\n- **Accounts Payable at start:** 3,350,120\n- **Accounts Payable at end:** 3,350,120\n\nThus,\n\n**Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable = 3,350,120 - 3,350,120 = 0**\n\n## 5. Format the Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"0.00\"} }\n```\n",
