Are these all at end of Jan 2024? Let's check if any of these were paid off or specifically an \"unpaid\" (open as of Jan 31, 2024).\n\nReviewing the rest of the data:\n\n- All these \"Purchase\" transactions with \"Unpaid | Account Payable\" are at 2023-12-31.\n- No evidence of payment (no offsetting payment transactions shown) through Jan 31.\n- Therefore, these should be outstanding at Jan 31, 2024.\n\nSo, all these unpaid purchases (above) are included.\n\n**Total Current Liabilities (End Value):**\n\nLet's sum accurately:\n\n| Purchase20231231002 | 80500.00 |\n| Purchase20231231003 | 342000.00 |\n| Purchase20231231006 | 406000.00 |\n| Purchase20231231007 | 137280.00 |\n| Purchase20231231012 | 288000.00 |\n| Purchase20231231013 | 103600.00 |\n| Purchase20231231015 | 132880.00 |\n| Purchase20231231016 | 665280.00 |\n| Purchase20231231017 | 230560.00 |\n| Purchase20231231018 | 316500.00 |\n| Purchase20231231020 | 299520.00 |\n| Purchase20231231021 | 348000.00 |\n\nLet's add stepwise:\n\n1. 80500.00\n2. +342000.00 = 422500.00\n3. +406000.00 = 828500.00\n4. +137280.00 = 965780.00\n5. +288000.00 = 1,253,780.00\n6. +103600.00 = 1,357,380.00\n7. +132880.00 = 1,490,260.00\n8. +665280.00 = 2,155,540.00\n9. +230560.00 = 2,386,100.00\n10. +316500.00 = 2,702,600.00\n11. +299520.00 = 3,002,120.00\n12. +348000.00 = 3,350,120.00\n\n**Total: 3,350,120.00**\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"3350120.00\"} }\n```\n\n**(Explanation:** Initial is zero as no opening liability reported; ending is sum of all \"Unpaid | Account Payable\" purchases still outstanding.)**",
