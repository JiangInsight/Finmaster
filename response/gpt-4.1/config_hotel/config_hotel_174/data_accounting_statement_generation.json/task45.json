                        "content": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n## 1. What are Investing Activities?\nInvesting Activities typically include:\n- Purchases or sales of property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) — e.g., fixed assets\n- Purchases or redemption of long-term investments\n- Loans made to or received from other entities (not operating loans)\n\nPurchase of inventory and expenses are NOT investing activities—they are operating.\nSales are operating as well (unless sale of a fixed asset/investment, which isn't indicated here).\n\n## 2. Find All Investing Activity Transactions\n\nWe need to look for transactions related to:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets or similar large non-current assets (e.g. \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar types)\n- *Exclude* purchases labeled as \"Purchase\" for normal business inventory (rooms, meals, etc.)\n\nLet's scan the data for such records:\n\n### a. Initial Fixed Asset\n- **Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | ... | amount: 8,000,000.0**  \n  Initial opening entry, NOT a cash flow of THIS PERIOD.  \n  (Usually, opening balances are not included in CFS for the period, as they're beginning balances.)\n\n### b. FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | ... | amount: 928,991.43 | Paid | Bank Transfer | S009 | Supplier 9 | ... | Central AC4 | Central AC |\n= Paid for Central AC, so investing outflow: **928,991.43**\n\n### c. FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | ... | amount: 1,567,146.49 | Paid | Bank Transfer | S004 | Supplier 4 | ... | Renovation Project5 | Renovation Project |\n= Paid for Renovation, so investing outflow: **1,567,146.49**\n\n### d. Any Other?\nScan for other \"Fixed Assets Purchase\", \"Fixed Asset\", \"Renovation\", or similar types.\nAll other \"Purchase\" transactions refer to rooms, meals, etc. — these are operating inventory, **NOT investing activities**.\n\n## 3. Sum Up Investing Cash Flows\n\n- Outflow (Central AC) : 928,991.43\n- Outflow (Renovation Project) : 1,567,146.49\n\n#### Total Outflow:\n928,991.43 + 1,567,146.49 = **2,496,137.92**\n\n## 4. Any Investing Inflows?\nNo sales of fixed assets or other investing inflows are mentioned.\n\n## 5. Final Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n\nIt is **outflow**, so it's negative.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-2496137.92\"} }\n```",
