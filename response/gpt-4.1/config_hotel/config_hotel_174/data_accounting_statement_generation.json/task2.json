In this data, it's only these 3 records.\n\n- **Total Inflow = 150,000.00**\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Calculate Final Bank Deposit Balance**\n\n**Bank Deposits End Value = Initial + Inflows - Outflows**\n\n- Initial      =   5,000,000.00\n- Inflows      =    +150,000.00\n- Outflows     =  −5,211,218.92\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n```\nEnd Value = 5,000,000.00 + 150,000.00 - 5,211,218.92\n          = 5,150,000.00 - 5,211,218.92\n          =  -61,218.92\n```\n\nThis would indicate an overdrawn bank account, which, with the current data, may be possible or may mean something is missed.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Sanity Check:**\nAre there any sales/receipts that credit the bank directly (rather than cash/account receivable)?  \nCheck all entries with \"Paid\"/\"Bank Transfer\" as receive_method for sales.  \nIn this dataset, all sales with \"Paid\" have `receive_method = Cash`. There are NO sales directly credited to Bank.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Final Answer Formatting**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"-61218.92\"} }\n```\n\n## 6. **Summary of Reasoning**\n\n- Started with 5,000,000.00 initial bank deposit\n- Paid (outflow) via bank for purchases & FA: 5,211,218.92\n- Inflow from cash to bank transfer: 150,000.00\n- No sales directly credited to bank\n- **End value is negative: -61,218.92**\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"-61218.92\"} }\n```",
