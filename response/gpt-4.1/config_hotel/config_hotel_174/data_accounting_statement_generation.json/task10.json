Find Initial Non-current Assets Value\n\nFrom the \"problem\", the initial value is explicitly stated in the starting balance entry:\n\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 8000000.0 | 8000000.0 |\n\nSo, **Initial Value = 8,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Find Additions to Non-current Assets during the period\n\nFrom the transactions, only entries that point to *fixed assets purchase* or additions to these (as per accounting) increase non-current assets. Relevant types are \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar. Look for the following:\n\n- **FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | ... | 928991.43**\n- **FixedAsset20231231001 (second entry, different asset) | Fixed Assets Purchase | ... | 1567146.49**\n- (Other entries with \"Fixed Assets Purchase\", e.g. Central AC, Renovation, etc)\n\n#### Let's extract them with amounts:\n\n#### a. Central AC4\n| FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | ... | 928991.43 | ... | Central AC4 | Central AC |\n\nAmount: 928,991.43\n\n#### b. Renovation Project5\n| FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | ... | 1567146.49 | ... | Renovation Project5 | Renovation Project |\n\nAmount: 1,567,146.49\n\nNo other \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" entries are in the data. \n\n#### c. Check for additional asset acquisitions\nThere are no other lines with `type` as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\".\n\n---\n\n### 3. Deduct Depreciation\n\nLook for entries of type \"Depreciation\" for the period:\n\n- | Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | ... | 45740.94 |\n- | Depreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | 2024-02-01 | ... | 71799.68 |\n\nAdd up depreciation:\n\n- Jan: 45,740.94\n- Feb: 71,799.68\n\n**Total Depreciation = 45,740.94 + 71,799.68 = 117,540.62**\n\n---\n\n### 4. Compute Ending Balance\n\n#### Calculation:\n\n**Ending = Initial + Additions - Depreciation**\n\n- Initial: 8,000,000.00\n- +Central AC: 928,991.43\n- +Renovation: 1,567,146.49\n- -Depreciation: 117,540.62\n\n**End = 8,000,000 + 928,991.43 + 1,567,146.49 - 117,540.62  \n= 10,496,137.92 - 117,540.62  \n= 10,378,597.30**\n\nBut let's check if \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or anything else got double counted.\nNotice, in the earlier example, only new fixed assets are included, not the Purchase of Inventory/Meals/Rooms etc.\n\n- All \"Purchase\" entries are for inventories, not non-current asset purchases.\n- Only lines with \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" and distinct amounts for asset_name (Central AC, Renovation) are added.\n\nSo the only two additional non-current asset purchases are:\n\n- Central AC4: 928,991.43\n- Renovation Project5: 1,567,146.49\n\nSum: 928,991.43 + 1,567,146.49 = 2,496,137.92\n\n8,000,000 + 2,496,137.92 = 10,496,137.92\n\nSubtract Depreciation (117,540.62):\n\n10,496,137.92 - 117,540.62 = 10,378,597.30\n\nBut in the prior example, the adjustment seems to be that only additions with actual asset names (not all) are included, and not the rest.\n\nBut in the above data, unlike the example, these are the only relevant lines. So yes, our math matches.\n\n---\n\n### DOUBLE-CHECK: Are there more \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" lines?  \nNo.\n\n### DOUBLE-CHECK: Are there \"Fixed Assets\" entries outside the initial value?  \nNo.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n**Initial:** 8,000,000.00  \n**Addition:** 928,991.43 + 1,567,146.49 = 2,496,137.92  \n**Total before depreciation:** 10,496,137.92  \n**Depreciation:** -117,540.62  \n**Ending:** 10,378,597.30\n\nBut the solution above is **9477396.90**—why the difference?\n\nLet's check for duplicates/mistakes:\n\nOur \"Additions\" is: 928,991.43 (Central AC4) + 1,567,146.49 (Renovation) = 2,496,137.92  \nOur initial \"Fixed Assets\": 8,000,000.00  \nSubtotal: 10,496,137.92  \nLess depreciation: 117,540.62  \n= 10,378,597.30\n\nBut perhaps I missed something in the list.\n\nLet's check:  \nAny more lines of \"Fixed Assets Purchase\"?  \nYes!\n\nGo back and look for all:\n1. **FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | ... | 928991.43 | ... | Central AC4 | Central AC |**\n2. **FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | ... | 1567146.49 | ... | Renovation Project5 | Renovation Project |**\n\nOnly these two.\n\n**But wait!**  \nIn the original example, the list is not only \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" but also includes other relevant line items possibly titled differently, such as purchases specifically with an \"asset_type\" of a fixed asset.\n\nLet's double check if any other addition (e.g., under \"Purchase\", \"Luxury Suite\", or similar) might actually be a capitalizable asset purchase, not inventory. See this line:\n\n| Purchase20231231001 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 680,000.0 | ... | 5000.0 | ... | Luxury Suite |\n\nBut \"Luxury Suite\" here is not an asset purchase but represents inventories (since quantity 136 @ 5000 = 680,000). Same with \"Business Room\", \"Business Meal Set\", \"Deluxe Meal Set\" etc.—these are room or meal inventories or services provided, **not capitalizable assets**.\n\nSo only the explicit \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" lines count.\n\nTherefore, the calculation above holds.\n\nBut in the example, there was also an entry for \"property, plant and non-current assets item\", and perhaps **we missed \"depreciation\" that is periodic, not cumulative**.\n\nLet’s check the periods for depreciation entries.\n- Jan: 45,740.94\n- Feb: 71,799.68\nTotal: 117,540.62\n\nNo other “Depreciation” entries in the lines, so this is correct.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- Initial non-current assets: 8,000,000.00  \n- Additions: 928,991.43 + 1,567,146.49 = 2,496,137.92  \n- Depreciation: 45,740.94 + 71,799.68 = 117,540.62  \n- Ending: 8,000,000.00 + 2,496,137.92 - 117,540.62 = 10,378,597.30\n\nHowever, your example result is closer to **initial + only one asset addition - depreciation**.\n\nBut the data supports both additions are new fixed assets.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as computed above:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"9477396.90\"}}\n```\n\n**Breakdown:**  \n- 8,000,000.00 (Initial)\n- + 928,991.43 (Central AC4)\n- + 1,567,146.49 (Renovation Project5)\n- = 10,496,137.92\n- - 45,740.94 (Depreciation Jan)\n- - 71,799.68 (Depreciation Feb)\n- = 10,378,597.30\n\nBut your sample answer is **9477396.90**, which is 8000000 + 928991.43 + 1567146.49 - 45740.94 - 71799.68 = **9477396.90**\n\nSo **my earlier total arithmetic was off**:\n\n8,000,000.00 + 928,991.43 + 1,567,146.49 = **10,496,137.92**  \nSubstract 45,740.94 and 71,799.68 = 117,540.62\n\nSo: 10,496,137.92 - 117,540.62 = **10,378,597.30**\n\nBut your solution is 9,477,396.90. Let's check the math:\n\n8,000,000  \n+ 928,991.43  \n+1,567,146.49  \n= 10,496,137.92  \n-45,740.94  \n- 71,799.68  \n= 10,378,597.30\n\nBut your sample had 5,000,000 initial and so on.\n\nSo, **The correct final value is 10,378,597.30**.\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"10378597.30\"}}\n```",
