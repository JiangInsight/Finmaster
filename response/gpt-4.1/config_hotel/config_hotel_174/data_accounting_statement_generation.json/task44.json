We need to compute the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" to be disclosed as outflow in the cash flow statement.\n2. From your transaction list, we are only interested in actual _cash purchases_ of fixed assets in the period.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Fixed Asset Purchases\n\nLook through all transactions to identify cash outflows for Fixed Asset acquisition. \nThere are two relevant entries labeled as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" (ignore regular \"Purchase\" of inventories for cash flow fixed asset section):\n\n- | FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 928991.43 | 928991.43 |  |  |  | Paid | Bank Transfer | S009 | Supplier 9 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Central AC4 | Central AC |\n- | FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 1567146.49 | 1567146.49 |  |  |  | Paid | Bank Transfer | S004 | Supplier 4 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Renovation Project5 | Renovation Project |\n\nBoth are Paid and by Bank Transfer (which is a cash equivalent).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total\n\n- 928991.43 + 1567146.49 = 2,496,137.92\n\n### Step 3: Confirm for any other cash paid for fixed assets\nLook through other \"Purchase\" entries: while many are \"Paid\", they are for meal sets, rooms, suites, banquet sets, etc., which are inventory for a hotel/restaurant business, not fixed assets.\n\n**No other \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar transaction with paid/cash/bank transfer status exists.**\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nThe cash outflow for purchase of fixed assets is **2,496,137.92**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"2496137.92\"} }\n```",
