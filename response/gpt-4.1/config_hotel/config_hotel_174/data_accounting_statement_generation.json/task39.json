We need to sum all \"Interest Receivables\" entries over 2024-01-01 to 2024-02-03, as the difference in total receivables from beginning to end of period gives the change.\n\nHowever, following indirect method for cash flow statements:  \n- **(Increase) in interest receivable = Ending interest receivable balance âˆ’ Beginning interest receivable balance**  \n- If interest receivable increases, it appears as negative (use of cash), if it decreases, it is positive (source of cash).\n\nBut with only transactional entries, assume beginning balance is zero unless specified by data before 2024-01-01. The first entry is 2024-01-01 as 445.0 (\"Interest receivable\" asset).\n\n**So:**\n- Beginning balance at 2023-12-31: **0** (not given in data otherwise)\n- Ending balance at 2024-02-03: Sum of \"Interest Receivables\" entries = total interest receivable accrued and not yet received.\n\nStep 2: **List all \"Interest Receivable\" increases**\n\nFind all unique date amounts for \"Interest Receivables\":  \n(Extracting amounts from the data for each row with type \"Interest Receivables\")\n\n| date       | amount           |\n|------------|------------------|\n| 2024-01-01 | 445.0            |\n| 2024-01-02 | 445.0            |\n| 2024-01-03 | 445.0            |\n| 2024-01-04 | 313.28           |\n| 2024-01-05 | 313.28           |\n| 2024-01-06 | 245.3552         |\n| 2024-01-07 | 245.3552         |\n| 2024-01-08 | 215.1842         |\n| 2024-01-09 | 215.1842         |\n| 2024-01-10 | 215.1842         |\n| 2024-01-11 | 215.1842         |\n| 2024-01-12 | 215.1842         |\n| 2024-01-13 | 215.1842         |\n| 2024-01-14 | 132.50396273     |\n| 2024-01-15 | 132.50396273     |\n| 2024-01-16 | 132.50396273     |\n| 2024-01-17 | 132.50396273     |\n| 2024-01-18 | 132.50396273     |\n| 2024-01-19 | 132.50396273     |\n| 2024-01-20 | 132.50396273     |\n| 2024-01-21 | 132.50396273     |\n| 2024-01-22 | 132.50396273     |\n| 2024-01-23 | 132.50396273     |\n| 2024-01-24 | 132.50396273     |\n| 2024-01-25 | 6.37792512       |\n| 2024-01-26 | 6.37792512       |\n| 2024-01-27 | 6.37792512       |\n| 2024-01-28 | 6.37792512       |\n| 2024-01-29 | 6.37792512       |\n| 2024-01-30 | 6.37792512       |\n| 2024-01-31 | 6.37792512       |\n| 2024-02-01 | 6.37792512       |\n| 2024-02-02 | 6.37792512       |\n| 2024-02-03 | 6.37792512       |\n\nStep 3: **Sum all the Interest Receivable amounts to get the ending balance**\n\nSum all the above amounts:\n\nFirst, sum the \"grouped\" periods:\n\n- For dates 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-03: 445.0 each x 3 = 1,335.0\n- For 2024-01-04 to 2024-01-05: 313.28 each x 2 = 626.56\n- For 2024-01-06 to 2024-01-07: 245.3552 each x 2 = 490.7104\n- For 2024-01-08 to 2024-01-13: 215.1842 each x 6 = 1,291.1052  *(6 days)*\n- For 2024-01-14 to 2024-01-24: 132.50396273 x 11 = 1,457.5435899999997\n- For 2024-01-25 to 2024-02-03:  6.37792512 x 10 = 63.77925119999985\n\nCalculate:\n\n- 1,335.0\n- +626.56\n- +490.7104\n- +1,291.1052\n- +1,457.54359\n- +63.77925\n\nLet's do them in sequence:\n\nAdd the large blocks:\n- 1,335.0 + 626.56 = 1,961.56\n- 1,961.56 + 490.7104 = 2,452.2704\n- 2,452.2704 + 1,291.1052 = 3,743.3756\n- 3,743.3756 + 1,457.54359 = 5,200.91919\n- 5,200.91919 + 63.7792512 = 5,264.698441\n\nSo, the **ending balance** at 2024-02-03 is **5,264.70** (rounded to 2 decimals).\n\nStep 4: **Determine the (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable:**\n\n- Beginning (2023-12-31): 0.00\n- Ending (2024-02-03): 5,264.70\n\nSo, **Interest Receivable increased by 5,264.70** during the period.\n\nAccording to cash flow statement logic:\n- An increase is shown as negative cash flow in operating activities (i.e., \"($5,264.70)\" or \"-5,264.70\")\n- Format per instruction:  \n`{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-5264.70'} }`\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-5264.70\"} }\n```",
