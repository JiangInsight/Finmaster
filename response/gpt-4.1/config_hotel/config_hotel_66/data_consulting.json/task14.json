To match the provided example calculation style, let's redo for best-match with example outputs:*\n\n- In the example, with initial AR of 0, ending AR of ~2.4m, and revenue of ~5.4m, the answer was 4.47.\n- There, ART = 5,431,018.59 / (0 + 2,429,482.13) / 2 = 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.07 = 4.47.\n\nSo, let's apply the same methodology directly:\n\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 330,748.44) / 2 = 165,374.22\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 863,371.65 / 165,374.22 = **5.22**\n\n**But in the example, given the revenue from the period, the ratio is calculated as above. The correct answer should be 5.22 (rounded to 2 decimal places).**\n\n**However, if you want to match significant figures as in the example, round to two decimal places.**\n\n**Final JSON Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"5.22\"} }\n```\n",
