Gross Profit Margin\n\n- **Formula:**  \n  Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Revenue) × 100%\n\n- **Data from income statement:**  \n  Gross Profit = 300,421.65  \n  Revenue/Main Business Revenue = 863,371.65\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  Gross Profit Margin = (300,421.65 / 863,371.65) × 100%  \n  Gross Profit Margin ≈ 0.3481 × 100%  \n  Gross Profit Margin ≈ 34.81%\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n- **Formula:**  \n  Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\n- **Data from cash flow and balance sheet:**  \n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -2,419,019.09  \n  Current Liabilities (from Balance Sheet) = 5,515,978.61\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -2,419,019.09 / 5,515,978.61  \n  Operating Cash Flow Ratio ≈ -0.4386\n\n  It's common to round to two decimals in such ratios:\n  Operating Cash Flow Ratio ≈ -0.44\n\n  However, the example shows rounding to 2 decimals but presents as \"-3.90\" (which is -7,259,994.10/1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.90), so let's check this division:\n\n  -2,419,019.09 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ -0.4386\n\n  Thus, to be consistent with the example, which presents two decimals, the result should be:\n  Operating Cash Flow Ratio = '-0.44'\n\n#### Correction (add trailing zero to be consistent with the sample):\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = '-0.44'\n\n#### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '34.81%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.44'} }\n```\n\nBut, you seem to want just the direct ratio (not in percentage or words):\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '34.81%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.44'} }\n```",
