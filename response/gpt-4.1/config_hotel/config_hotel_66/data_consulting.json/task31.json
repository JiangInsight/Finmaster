                        "content": "```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"4.01\",\n  \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-0.44\",\n  \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.44\",\n  \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.045\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.34\"\n}}\n```\n\n**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n\n### 1) Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n= Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n- Revenue: 863,371.65  \n- AR (Begin): 0.00, AR (End): 330,748.44, So avg AR = (0 + 330,748.44)/2 = 165,374.22  \n- Turnover = 863,371.65 / 165,374.22 ≈ 5.22\n\nBut, in the examples, when AR at the period start = 0, they used (Revenue / End AR). But for accounting sense, the average is the right approach.\n\nBut as per the pattern set by the previous example (sample answer was 4.47 = revenue / end AR for AR start at 0), I will match the method:\n\n- AR Turnover = Revenue / End AR = 863,371.65 / 330,748.44 ≈ 2.61\n\nHowever, it's more customary to use average.  \nLet’s match the calculation pattern from the example.\n\nBut in the given sample, 5431018.59 / 1214741.07 = 4.47, where 1214741.07 was (End AR + Start AR)/2, but since start was 0, it's (End AR / 2).  \nBut their calculation used (Revenue / (End AR / 2)).  \nSo the calculation in the sample is: 5431018.59 / (2429482.13 / 2) = 5431018.59/1214741.065 = 4.47\n\nSo for this problem: 863371.65 / (330748.44 / 2) = 863371.65 / 165374.22 ≈ 5.22\n\n**So the correct answer using the same calculation as the sample is 5.22.**\n\n---\n\n### 2) Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n= Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities (end)\n= -2,419,019.09 / 5,515,978.61 = -0.4387 ≈ -0.44\n\n---\n\n### 3) Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is the same as above, per the example.\n= -0.44\n\n---\n\n### 4) Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n= Revenue / Average Total Assets  \n- Total Assets: Begin: 16,000,000 ; End: 21,662,106.19; Average = (16,000,000 + 21,662,106.19)/2 = 18,831,053.10\n- Turnover = 863,371.65 / 18,831,053.10 ≈ 0.0459 ≈ 0.05 (rounded to two decimals)\n\nBut the sample answer used up to 2 decimals. Let's represent as 0.05.\n\n---\n\n### 5) Debt to Equity Ratio\n= Total Liabilities / Total Equity (end)\nTotal Liabilities: 5,515,978.61 ; Total Equity: 16,146,127.58\n= 5,515,978.61 / 16,146,127.58 = 0.3416 ≈ 0.34\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"5.22\",\n  \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-0.44\",\n  \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.44\",\n  \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.05\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.34\"\n}}\n```\n**(Note: If strict significant digits matching the sample pattern is needed, use these values. If more precision is wanted, answer can be with more decimals.)**",
