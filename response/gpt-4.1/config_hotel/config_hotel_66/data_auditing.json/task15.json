The sum of cash and bank is 8,000,000, matching Fixed Assets.  \n   - No problem in logic if it's an opening entry, with total initial assets split between bank/cash and fixed.\n   - But if representing the same event three times, the amounts are inconsistent as per accounting logic: the sum of cash+bank must equal fixed assets, but invoice records three totals separately, which may indicate a duplication.\n\n   - Since the invoice for Fixed Assets is for **8,000,000.00** but the recorded field also matches, and the others are entries with the same id and different labels and amounts, likely only the Fixed Assets row is correct for the total initial, so the others (Cash/Bank) are possibly duplicates. However, since the sample expects only internal inconsistencies per row, in this case, record for documentation.\n\n2. **Sale20240116046**:\n   - Invoice says: \"Sale\", 5.0 units at 8,935.37, total 44,676.85. \n   - But recorded_type: Depreciation; recorded_quantity: 4.0; recorded_unit_price: 8,935.37; recorded_amount: 35741.48.\n   - Internal inconsistency: category is Depreciation, but invoice/category should be Sale. The quantity should be 5.0 (matches invoice), but recorded as 4.0. The amount is 4 × 8,935.37 = 35,741.48, but should be 44,676.85.\n   - So, Original category: \"Sale\", Recorded: \"Depreciation\"; Original quantity: 5.0, Recorded: 4.0; Original amount: 44,676.85, Recorded: 35,741.48.\n\n*No other internal calculation mismatches found in the provided table within the described pattern—other fields match the invoice summary or are in correct logical alignment.*",
