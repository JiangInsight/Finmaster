That is, there is an internal inconsistency between the fixed asset's \"recorded amount\" and the invoice value.\n- The most reliable evidence is the invoice, which usually sums to $5,000,000.00 for Fixed Assets. The recorded value of $8,000,000.00 is likely a data entry/reporting error.\n\n**Other fields in this particular row are not detailed (such as preparer, approver, payment, etc).**\n\n**Thus, the main inconsistency is:**\n- id: Initial20231231001\n- incorrect field: recorded_amount (Fixed Assets row)\n- recorded value: 8,000,000.00\n- best estimate (from invoice and other rows): 5,000,000.00\n\n**Only this row is incorrect. The rest, such as the multiple \"Cash to bank transfer\" and \"Interest Receivables\" amounts being constant, appear internally consistent given the invoices.**\n\n**If more mismatches were present, they'd be listed; but in this table, this is the only clear numerical/internal error matching the invoice.**\n",
