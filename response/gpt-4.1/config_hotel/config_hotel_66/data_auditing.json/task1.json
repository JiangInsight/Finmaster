For id `Initial20231231001`:\n- There are 3 entries with id Initial20231231001 (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets).\n- Invoice for \"Fixed Assets\" is $8,000,000, \"Cash deposit\" is $3,000,000, and \"Bank deposit\" is $5,000,000.\n- The sum of Cash deposit ($3,000,000) and Bank deposit ($5,000,000) equals the Fixed Asset ($8,000,000), which matches the invoice explanation, i.e., the initial capital introduced as $8M is split between Cash/Bank/Fixed Assets.\n- But if all 3 are recorded as separate, it's error-prone (possible double-counting of funds and net assets). The \"Fixed Assets\" value should not be additive with Cash/Bank in totals.\n- This is an internal consistency concern. Thus, the \"type breakdown\" is listed as a discrepancy for the same id.\n\n#### 2. For id `Expense20240109001`:\n- There are two entries with the same id: one with Administrative Expenses ($634.23) and one with Sales Expenses ($517.59).\n- The invoice for the $517.59 entry states \"Sales Expenses\", but the recorded_type is \"Administrative Expenses\". This is a misclassification.\n- The correct (Original) category per invoice is \"Sales Expenses\", but it was recorded as \"Administrative Expenses\", so that's the error.\n\n#### 3. For id `Expense20240124001`:\n- There are two entries: one with Financial Expenses ($119.55), another with Sales Expenses ($442.56).\n- The invoice for $119.55 states \"Sales Expenses\", but the recorded_type field states \"Financial Expenses\".\n- So, original (invoice) expense is \"Sales Expenses\", but recorded as \"Financial Expenses\".\n\n_Note: The rest of the transactions either have matching types with their invoices or are consistent multiple expense splits (common in expense systems), and thus don't constitute an \"inconsistency or error\" given the task description._\n\n**If future inconsistencies in payment status, payment method, quantity or price were spotted, they would be added similarly by mapping 'Original' (invoice) vs 'Recorded' (table) for the same entry id.**",
