This suggests Fixed Assets should be recorded as an account affected, not a separate line with 8,000,000. Invoice indicates Cash deposit of $3,000,000, Bank deposit of $5,000,000, and Fixed Assets should be credited for their sum $8,000,000 (not $8,000,000 additional). So the third row's amount should be negative or only appear once in the correct mapping; in the context, should be 8,000,000 as total, matching others, but with proper double-entry. So, the issue is in journal structure/respect to double entry, not in the individual fields as isolated single-rows, but together form inconsistency.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": \"Sale20240123071\",\n        \"incorrect field(s)\": [\"recorded_profit\"],\n        \"recorded values\": {\"recorded_profit\": 4778.65},\n        \"best estimate of correct values\": {\"recorded_profit\": 6475.05},\n        \"explanation\": \"From invoice: Sale consists of 5x3295.01 = 16,475.05, cost = 10,000.00. Profit should be 16,475.05 - 10,000.00 = 6,475.05, but recorded profit is 4,778.65, which matches after-tax ('after tax amount') not gross profit. So correct profit is 6,475.05.\"\n    }\n]}\n```\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. For `Initial20231231001`, there are three rows with the same ID, but the sum of cash and bank deposit equals the fixed assets, suggesting these lines represent a single transaction (capital injection or asset mapping, typical for an opening balance or capital formation). So the \"Fixed Assets\" shouldn't be an additional line of 8 million, but rather the sum of Cash + Bank = Fixed Asset, thus only credited once. In a journal, these should be recorded as debit cash 3M, debit bank 5M, credit capital or fixed asset 8M, or similar. Alone, each row mirrors the invoice, but together introduce internal double-entry inconsistency. \n\n2. For `Sale20240123071`, the profit calculation by invoice suggests:\n   - Amount: 5 × 3295.01 = 16,475.05.\n   - Cost: 10,000.00.\n   - Profit should be 16,475.05 - 10,000.00 = 6,475.05.\n   - Recorded profit is 4,778.65—matching after-tax/something else, not real profit. Correct profit should be 6,475.05.\n   \nAll other fields in the sample provided appear internally consistent with invoice and double-checked calculations.\n\n**Note:** The template incorporates only the errors directly evidenced in the provided rows.
