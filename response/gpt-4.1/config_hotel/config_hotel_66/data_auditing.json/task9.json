It should be $192.67.\n\n#### No other internal calculation/self-consistency errors noticed in the provided partial table.\n- All sales/purchase line totals (unit price × quantity) match amount\n- Cash/account methods match the context in the invoice text\n- Costs and profits make sense per the rows provided\n\n---\n\n- If more inconsistencies are present, expand, but in this data these are the two main ones per the patterns in your problem and example. If you spot another value, repeat this pattern for further issues.\n",
