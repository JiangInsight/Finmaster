However, if there was a mismatch (say, Fixed Assets recorded as 7000000.00), that would be the field in error. Here, they align.\n- For \"Sale20240108021\", the invoice says: \"consisting of 4.0 units at a unit price of $5100.80, totaling $20403.20...\" but the recorded fields show unit price 5592.21 and total 23453.26 instead of 5100.80 and 20403.20. Also, the recorded date is 2024-02-01, but the invoice date is 2024-01-08. So, the incorrect fields are recorded_date, recorded_unit_price, and recorded_amount. They should be corrected to the invoice values.\n",
