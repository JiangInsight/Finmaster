Initial20231231001** (initial capitalization):\n- There are three records for this transaction id:\n    - Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00 (matches invoice)\n    - Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00 (matches invoice)\n    - Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.00 (but invoice says: \"On December 31, 2023, ... totaling $5000000.00.\" per the sample, the fixed asset should sum cash+bank = 8,000,000 in total only if fully capitalized, but prior examples (from Question's start) showed Fixed Assets amount as 5,000,000.00, thus most likely the correct amount per the more reliable invoice is 5,000,000 rather than 8,000,000).\n- **Detected**: Recorded amount for Fixed Assets should be $5,000,000, not $8,000,000.\n\n**2. Purchase20231231001**:\n- There are two records:\n    - 129 × 2,880 = 371,520 (recorded as Paid/Bank Transfer, Preparer: Executive Director)\n    - 288 × 2,880 = 829,440 (recorded as Unpaid/Account Payable, Preparer: Director)\n- From invoice: The two quantities and amounts correspond.\n- But in the data row for id Purchase20231231001 (129×2880), supplier is S009, but the paid/unpaid/payment_method/preparer are swapped with Purchase20231231002.\n- **Detected**: The \"Paid\"/\"Unpaid\" and \"Bank Transfer\"/\"Account Payable\" and \"Executive Director\"/\"Director\" are mismatched between these two entries. By the pattern, the unpaid/account payable/Director should go with the 288 units, and the paid/bank transfer/Executive Director with the 129 units. Thus, the payment/receipt_status, payment_method, and preparer should be swapped for these two entries.\n\n**3. Purchase20231231020**:\n- Preparer is missing but all others show Preparer as \"Executive Director\". Invoice also says \"This transaction was prepared by Executive Director\". Thus Preparer should be \"Executive Director\", but is currently blank.\n- **Detected**: Preparer missing.\n\n**No other internal inconsistencies or errors detected in the sample provided** (all other amounts, quantities, and descriptive invoice statements match the fields). \n\n---\n\nIf more than the three above, please provide specific indices/IDs!",
