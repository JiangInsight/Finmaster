Initial20231231001 (Fixed Assets):**\n- There are three \"Initial20231231001\" entries for \"Cash deposit\" (3,000,000.0), \"Bank deposit\" (5,000,000.0), and \"Fixed Assets\" (should sum to 8,000,000.0), but the recorded amount for \"Fixed Assets\" is 8,000,000.0. However, per the invoice, the \"Fixed Assets\" entry should only be 5,000,000.0, matching the others (Cash deposit + Bank deposit = 8,000,000.0? But each deposit should also individually match their amounts and the assets should match with recorded funding). The inconsistency is that the Fixed Assets should likely be 5,000,000.0, not 8,000,000.0 (since usually assets = sources). The entries are likely duplicated or mis-totaled.\n\n**2. Sale20240123071:**\n- The invoice for Sale20240123071 says \"consisting of 5.0 units at a unit price of $3295.01, totaling $16475.05. ... The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- The recorded row shows a quantity of 4.0 (should be 5.0), amount 13180.04 (should be 16475.05 for 5 @ 3295.01), and status \"Unpaid\" (should be Paid). \n- So the invoice data is most reliable, thus these fields are inconsistent and we provide the correction.\n\n**No other clear row-wise inconsistencies:**\n- Other sales and purchases have recorded fields (quantity, unit price, amount) matching invoice details, or are consistent.\n- No tax, preparer, or approver inconsistencies are present in this snippet otherwise. Negative tax/interest/amounts, if any, should be handled as needed elsewhere.\n```",
