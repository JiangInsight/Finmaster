Normally, the sum of initial cash and bank deposits should equal the fixed asset allocation. The amounts are consistent (3000000.0 + 5000000.0 = 8000000.0), but listing Fixed Assets as a separate transaction with the total may duplicate the sum. The original amounts should be clarified as: cash deposit: 3000000.0, bank deposit: 5000000.0, not a direct fixed assets item.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240128089\",\n    \"Original amount\": \"218.96\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"0.0\",\n    \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"0.0\",\n    \"Original price\": \"218.96\",\n    \"Recorded price\": \"256.89\",\n    \"Original tax\": \"10.95\",\n    \"Recorded tax\": \"191.51\",\n    \"risk_note\": \"Invoice states 'consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $218.96, totaling $218.96... tax $10.95', but fields are incoherent: amount=0, quantity=0, price=256.89, tax=191.51. The correct values per the invoice are: amount=218.96, quantity=1.0, price=218.96, tax=10.95.\"\n  }\n]}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \n1. **Initial20231231001**  \n   - There are three entries with the same id: cash deposit (3,000,000), bank deposit (5,000,000), and fixed assets (8,000,000). The invoice \"amount\" field for the Fixed Asset is 8,000,000, which appears to be the sum of the two. This could cause confusion and double-counting if not properly treated as a split, as the breakdown is not clear from the record. Clarifying breakdown and that initial cash and bank deposit are assets to be assigned accordingly is needed.  \n   - No other inconsistent fields detected, but the split design is internally inconsistent from an accounting perspective for a single transaction ID.\n\n2. **Sale20240128089**  \n   - The invoice text: 'consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $218.96, totaling $218.96. The cost amount for this transaction was $150.00, with a tax amount of $10.95, leading to a total amount due of $208.01...'  \n   - Recorded fields: amount=0.0, quantity=0.0, price=256.89, tax=191.51.  \n   - Clearly the fields are wrong; the correct should be: amount=218.96, quantity=1.0, price=218.96, tax=10.95 according to the invoice.\n\n**If you have additional cases, continue this pattern. For all other records, no internal inconsistencies were found.**",
