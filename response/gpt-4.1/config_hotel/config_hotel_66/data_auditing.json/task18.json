The sum of Cash and Bank deposit matches the original fixed asset value ($3,000,000 + $5,000,000 = $8,000,000), but the invoice for 'Fixed Assets' states $5,000,000. The 'recorded_amount' for 'Fixed Assets' should be $5,000,000 to align with the reliable invoice data, not $8,000,000.

Others match their invoices.  \n- For Initial20231231001, the most plausible error is that the 'Fixed Assets' amount should be $5,000,000 as per the invoice, not $8,000,000 (likely a mis-merge).\n- For Sale20240125078, the recorded fields are all mismatched versus the invoice.\n- All other entries either match their invoice or have no substantive field error.\n\nIf you need all detected inconsistencies for the entire dataset, please specify.",
