The more reliable/accountant-sourced figure from the invoice is $5,000,000.  \n**=> So likely error: Fixed Assets should be $5,000,000, not $8,000,000 (the actual amount shown on the invoice).**\n\n---\n\n**(2) Sale20240129092 (Financial Expenses)**\n- The invoice says: \"On January 29, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 3.0 units at a unit price of $593.26, totaling $1,779.78. The cost amount for this transaction was $1,050.00, with a tax amount of $88.99, leading to a total amount due of $1,690.79. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- The record instead lists:\n  - recorded_type: Financial Expenses (not Sale)  \n  - recorded_unit_price: 502.42 (should be 593.26 per invoice)  \n  - Other fields match the invoice.\n- So, the recorded 'category/type' and 'unit price' don't match the more reliable invoice narrative.\n**=> Original category: Sale; Recorded category: Financial Expenses. Original unit price: 593.26; Recorded price: 502.42.**\n\n---\n\n**For clarity:**  \n- If 'none' for a field, not shown above.  \n- I list only material inconsistencies with evidence in the invoice that clearly contradicts the recorded value.\n```",
