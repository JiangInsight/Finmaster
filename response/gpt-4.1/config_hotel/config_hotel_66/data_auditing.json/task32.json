There is no inconsistency in value, but in the initial example from the question, the Fixed Assets line had 5,000,000 which was wrong, but in your input, the value is 8,000,000 so it matches the sum and is now consistent.\n- **Sale20240106012**: The invoice line describes: \"on January 06, 2024... for a Sale, consisting of 3.0 units at a unit price of $4694.82, totaling $14084.46...\", but the recorded row states 2 units at 5592.03 each, totaling 9389.64. Therefore, there are inconsistencies in the recorded date (should be 2024-01-06, not 2024-01-23), quantity (should be 3, not 2), price (should be 4694.82, not 5592.03), and amount (should be 14084.46, not 9389.64).\n\n*Other entries in your sample do not appear to have internal inconsistencies between the row data and the invoice text description, based on the provided sample.*\n\nIf you want a flat dictionary (not a list), please specify for future outputs!",
