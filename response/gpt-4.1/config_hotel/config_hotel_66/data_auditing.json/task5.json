Initial20231231001**  \n- The problem table shows three entries for Initial20231231001: Cash deposit ($3,000,000), Bank deposit ($5,000,000), and Fixed Assets ($8,000,000).  \n- All invoices (considered most reliable) show the *Fixed Assets* as $8,000,000, not $5,000,000 as in example data.  \n- Correct amount should be $8,000,000 not a lower previously encountered value.\n\n**2. Sale20240126081**  \n- The invoice describes a Sale of **3 units** at unit price $2,034.10, totaling $6,102.30 (3 × 2,034.10 = 6,102.30).\n- But in the table, 'recorded_quantity' is 2.0 and 'recorded_amount' is 4,068.20 (2 × 2,034.10).  \n- 'recorded_profit' and 'cost' also based on this, but invoice is for 3 units/6,102.30.\n- From reliable invoice: quantity should be 3.0; amount $6,102.30.\n\n**No other internal inconsistencies are seen**:\n- All purchase/sale/expense rows line up with their respective invoice stated quantities, unit prices, and amounts.  \n- Invoices for other interest, depreciation, expenses, show no mismatch to their corresponding rows.\n- Any differences in preparer/approver are as in invoice.\n\n**(If you encountered only one instance of Initial20231231001, select the most \"complete\" / latest value as correct: here $8,000,000, Fixed Assets.)**\n\nHence, the only inconsistencies in this dataset, confirmed by cross-check against the reliable invoice field, are as above.
