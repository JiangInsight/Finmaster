However, typically a combined \"Fixed Assets\" increase should match the sum of Bank and Cash deposit. Given the invoice is for $8,000,000 on \"Fixed Assets\", but other entries with same id say $3,000,000 and $5,000,000, those $3m and $5m can be considered sources, not the invoice category. Thus, other two rows don't fit the invoice (no invoice for $3m Cash, no invoice for $5m Bank), meaning either these rows are misrecorded or represent internal postings not corresponding to an actual invoice.  \nSo, we only include the $8m Fixed Assets for the id.  \n**So, the $8,000,000 is correct; others are not considered errors since no invoice for those values. But since only the $8,000,000 \"Fixed Assets\" entry is strictly supported by the reliable invoice, that is what will be filled.**\n\n2. **Sale20240105008**:  \n- Recorded_payment/receipt_status: **Unpaid**  \n- Invoice says **\"The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"**  \nSo, the payment status is incorrect. It should be \"Paid\".  \n**Everything else matches.**\n\n3. **All other entries**:  \n- Other Payment/receipt_statuses, payment methods, and amounts for each id match the invoice details provided (e.g., all fields, especially where invoice gives itemized quantity/unit price/amount, the line matches).  \n- No inconsistencies found in other rows with respect to the invoice.\n\nThus, only these two issues are found.",
