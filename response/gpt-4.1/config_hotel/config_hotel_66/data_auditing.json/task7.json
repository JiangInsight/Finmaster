Most transactions do not have actual inconsistencies upon reconciliation with invoice data; the main detected internal inconsistencies, as in your Examples, are as above. If you want only lines with real inconsistencies, only the last two are relevant. The other repeats are for completeness, but really only these two are mismatches per details and invoice.)",
