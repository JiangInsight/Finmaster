The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $1609.59, leading to a total amount due of $30582.29.\"\n- But in the table, the `recorded_type` is \"Purchase\", and the tax is recorded as 27827.45.\n- By matching to the highly reliable invoice field, the correct transaction type (category) is \"Sale\", and the correct tax should be 1609.59.\n- The rest of the information (date, quantity, price, payment method/status, etc.) is consistent and doesn't have explicit recorded values in this row needing correction, or already matches invoice.\n\nThus, the above JSON solution correctly identifies the internal inconsistencies.\n",
