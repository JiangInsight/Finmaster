Initial20231231001:\n- There are three entries for the same id (`Initial20231231001`): \"Cash deposit\" ($3,000,000), \"Bank deposit\" ($5,000,000), and \"Fixed Assets\" ($8,000,000).\n- Both the \"Cash deposit\" and \"Bank deposit\" reference the same id and date and together sum to $8,000,000, which equals the \"Fixed Assets\" value.\n- The error is not in amounts (they reconcile), but there is an internal inconsistency: the \"Fixed Assets\" row should show $8,000,000 in accordance with the invoice (the invoice says Fixed Assets for that amount).\n- Therefore, the \"Fixed Assets\" row is correct for the total; the split between \"Cash deposit\" and \"Bank deposit\" is not reported in the invoice. All amounts reconcile, but the mapping in internal categories may not match the actual cash/bank movement.\n- Given priority to the invoice, this is a field-use mismatch, but amounts themselves are not inconsistent with the evidence.\n\n#### 2. Interest20240104004:\n- The invoice says: On January 04, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Interest Receivables, totaling $357.02.\n- Entry has: id = Interest20240104004, recorded_date = 2024-01-19, recorded_amount = 411.32.\n- Discrepancy between `recorded_date` and invoice date, and recorded amount and invoice amount.\n- Correct date is `2024-01-04`, correct amount is `357.02`.\n\n---\n\nNo other material internal inconsistencies are evident based on the given invoices and table data. Each of the rest (for Sample) matches the calculations and the invoice wordings, especially on amounts and the attributes described as \"standardized and regulated\".\n\n**Note**: Other entries, such as entries for interest receivable amounts, show small varying values which match invoice text and thus are not discrepancies. No duplicated or mismatched internal fields except those flagged above are present. If you wish for quantity/price calculation errors or other cross-checks, please specify.\n\nIf more inconsistencies are desired (for every minor discrepancy), let me know!",
