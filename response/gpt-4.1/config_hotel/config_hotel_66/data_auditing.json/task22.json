Fixed Assets:\n- There are three 'Initial20231231001' entries: \"Cash deposit\" (3,000,000.0), \"Bank deposit\" (5,000,000.0), \"Fixed Assets\" (should sum the first two).\n- The \"Fixed Assets\" row's amount is **8,000,000.0**, and the invoice matches (it's the sum of cash + bank), so actually, this row is **correct**. No inconsistency for this entry.\n- Therefore, **no error**, this is a check, not an error.\n\n#### 2. Sale20240122069:\n- Invoice says: 2 units at $2,588.14 = $5,176.28 (so unit price per invoice: 2,588.14).\n- Recorded unit price: 2,469.21 (error).\n- Date: Recorded date is 2024-01-23, but invoice says January 22, 2024. Discrepancy found.\n- So both unit price and date are incorrect per invoice.\n- All other fields are supported by the invoice text.\n\n#### 3. All other Sale and Purchase lines:\n- I examined all sales and purchases with both per-unit math and date cross-checks with the invoice. For all, the 'recorded_unit_price', 'recorded_amount', and 'invoice' text match except for Sale20240122069.\n- No other row has an internal inconsistency between invoice and fields.\n\n#### 4. Expenses/Interest/Depreciation:\n- These are single-amount rows, and their 'recorded_amount' always matches the invoice total. No fields for quantity or unit price. No discrepancies found.\n\n#### 5. Summing up:\n- Only **Sale20240122069** has internal inconsistencies in unit price and date.\n- No other entries in the provided data have such inconsistencies.\n\n**If you expect more errors, or if there are other fields to review, feel free to clarify!**",
