Cash deposit is for $3,000,000, Bank deposit for $5,000,000, Fixed Assets for $8,000,000.\n   - In the invoice field (trusted), it's stated that an invoice was issued for a Fixed Assets, totaling $8,000,000, but there are also separate entries and invoice statements for $3,000,000 (Cash deposit) and $5,000,000 (Bank deposit).\n   - Based on standard accounting, Initial balances should balance (Assets = Cash + Bank + Fixed Assets), but the Fixed Assets amount should be equal to the sum of cash and bank, or at least consistent.\n   - Here, $3,000,000 (Cash) + $5,000,000 (Bank) = $8,000,000 (Fixed Assets), suggesting perhaps these were all part of the opening balance. However, in the given tabular entry, each is recorded with a separate invoice and dollar value, which may be a presentation/duplication error. For this record, there is no unmatched field but the presentation of all three lines for the same id with different types is suspect, but not conclusively an internal inconsistency unless more info is given.\n\n2. **Expense20240119001:**\n   - Risk_issues field explicitly flags Payment Method: invoice says \"cash\", but recorded_payment_method is \"Bank Transfer\".\n   - So, the correct value is \"Cash\" as per invoice.\n   - Other details match.\n\nOthers:\n- For all other entries, based on the trusted invoice, the amounts, payment_method, and other details all match the recorded fields. There are no mismatches detected on review (factory check of payment method, status, amount, product details, etc. with the invoice).\n- No other risk_issues fields are flagged.\n- All Sale/Purchase records, their quantities and unit prices, match the total in the invoice.\n- All Expense and Depreciation have the same amounts in both fields.\n\nThus, these two inconsistencies exist in your dataset.\n\n*Note: The first one, “Fixed Assets”, is subtle—the possible issue is the summarization/opening-balance style entry where the same id is used for three entries, each with different types and amounts, but the invoices and table line up per entry: it’s improper structure but not a data-field-value inconsistency. If more guidance wants only data-field inconsistencies, then only the Expense20240119001 entry is strictly an error; please adjust accordingly.*",
