Otherwise, it starts at zero.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find Initial AR Value\n\nLooking at the \"Initial20231231001\" rows. There are only:\n- Cash deposit\n- Bank deposit\n- Fixed Assets\n\n**No initial Accounts Receivable!**\n\nSo,\n\n```\nAccounts Receivable Initial Value = 0.00\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate AR Transactions (Jan 1, 2024 onward)\n\nWe add the value of AR created by sales on credit, and subtract any AR receipts (when customers pay their debts; in the data, all customer payments are either \"Paid\"/Cash).\n\nBut by the structure, payments don't decrease AR directly here, unless there were specific \"AR collected\" transactions, but our data doesn't specify such lines (i.e., there's no receipt of AR shown--once it's unpaid, it just accumulates).\n\nWe'll therefore **sum all sales that create AR**.\n\nOnly transactions with:\n- type = \"Sale\"\n- AND payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\"\n- AND/OR receive_method = \"Account Receviable\" (sometimes typos, but always same meaning)\n- (If both columns missing, unlikely - but not seen in the sample)\n\nSale type, \"Unpaid\" (credit), in \"payment/receipt_status\"  \nSumming \"amount\"\n\n---\n\n#### Let's Extract all Sale Transactions that create AR\n\nFrom the provided data, let's go day-by-day and collect:\n\n---\n\n#### January 4:\n- Sale20240104007: amount=2565.95 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### January 5:\n- Sale20240105009: 15165.24 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240105010: 35700.75 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### January 6:\n- Sale20240106011: 16612.72 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240106012: 14084.46 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### January 9:\n- Sale20240109022: 16968.12 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### January 10:\n- Sale20240110027: 3991.62 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240110028: 2898.6 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### January 13:\n- Sale20240113034: 6602.81 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### January 14:\n- Sale20240114039: 2465.32 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### January 15:\n- Sale20240115042: 7483.8 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240115043: 13449.92 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240115044: 32191.88 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### January 16:\n- Sale20240116045: 2181.0 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240116047: 1498.88 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### January 19:\n- Sale20240119058: 17426.9 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240119059: 2673.06 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240119060: 31728.28 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### January 21:\n- Sale20240121065: 1066.25 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### January 22:\n- Sale20240122068: 10155.39 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240122069: 5176.28 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### January 24:\n- Sale20240124073: 5978.94 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### January 25:\n- Sale20240125077: 17006.35 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240125078: 215.02 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240125079: 5165.46 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### January 28:\n- Sale20240128088: 23080.35 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### January 29:\n- Sale20240129091: 16030.2 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### January 30:\n- Sale20240130094: 220.75 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240130095: 826.28 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240130096: 215.04 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### January 31:\n- Sale20240131097: 10896.0 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- Sale20240131098: 9026.82 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Sum All AR Transactions\n\nLet's total all the amounts:\n\nNow, sum up:\n\n```\n2565.95\n15165.24\n35700.75\n16612.72\n14084.46\n16968.12\n3991.62\n2898.6\n6602.81\n2465.32\n7483.8\n13449.92\n32191.88\n2181.0\n1498.88\n17426.9\n2673.06\n31728.28\n1066.25\n10155.39\n5176.28\n5978.94\n17006.35\n215.02\n5165.46\n23080.35\n16030.2\n220.75\n826.28\n215.04\n10896.0\n9026.82\n```\n\nLet's add them line by line.
