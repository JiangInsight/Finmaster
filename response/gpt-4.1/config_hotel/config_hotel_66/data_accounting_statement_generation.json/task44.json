This excludes purchases on credit/unpaid and only includes outflows for tangible fixed assets, not inventory/resale goods.\n\n2. **Dataset Review:**  \n   - Review all lines for indications of fixed asset purchases.\n   - Common keywords: \"type\" and \"product_name\"/\"asset_name\" indicating fixed assets, e.g., \"Fixed Assets Purchase\", \"Equipment\", \"Vehicle\", etc.\n\n3. **Spot fixed asset purchases:**  \n   - In your provided data, all **purchases** under \"type\" with a corresponding \"product_name\" relate to items like \"Banquet Set,\" \"Business Meal Set,\" \"Luxury Suite,\" etc.\n   - These names indicate inventory/operating assets for *resale/use in operations* (hospitality/meals/rooms), **not fixed assets**.\n   - There isn't a single transaction with \"Fixed Asset\" or similar permanent asset label in \"type\" or \"product_name.\"\n   - Initial balance: \"Initial20231231001\" includes \"Fixed Assets\" of 8,000,000.0 (as an opening balance, not a purchase in the current period).\n\n4. **Cash outflow check:**  \n   - All purchases paid by “Bank Transfer” or “Cash” are for consumable/operating assets, not company fixed assets.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**  \n   - **No cash paid for new fixed asset acquisitions in the period.**\n   - All purchases are for items meant for sale (inventory), NOT capitalized fixed assets.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"0\"}}\n```",
