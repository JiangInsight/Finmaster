What is \"Accounts Payable\" for Balance Sheet?\n\n**Accounts Payable** is the amount the company owes to suppliers for goods or services received but not paid for yet.  \n- On the balance sheet, only unpaid purchases (\"Unpaid\", \"Account Payable\" payment method) should be included.\n\n### 2. Find Initial Accounts Payable\n\nLook for any initial value (i.e., opening balance at 2023-12-31) related to Accounts Payable.\n\nLooking at the initial entries:\n\n- | Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | ... | \n- | Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | ...\n- | Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | ...\n\nNone of these is Accounts Payable.  \n> **So, Accounts Payable Initial Value = 0.00**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Find All Unpaid Purchases as of 2024-01-31 (End Date)\n\nFind all lines of type \"Purchase\" with \"Unpaid\" status, regardless of payment method, or payment_method \"Account Payable\".\n\nFilter:  \n- type = \"Purchase\"\n- payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\"  \nor  \n- payment_method = \"Account Payable\"\n\nLet's list them:\n\n#### Purchases with Unpaid Status:\n\n1. | Purchase20231231002 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 829440.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n2. | Purchase20231231004 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 1,250,000.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n3. | Purchase20231231005 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 246,000.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n4. | Purchase20231231007 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 140,800.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n5. | Purchase20231231008 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 254,320.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n6. | Purchase20231231011 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 540,000.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n7. | Purchase20231231013 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 585,000.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n8. | Purchase20231231014 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 755,000.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n9. | Purchase20231231015 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 59,850.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n10. | Purchase20231231019 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 32,850.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n11. | Purchase20231231022 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 19,050.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n12. | Purchase20231231023 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 358,500.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n13. | Purchase20231231024 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 402,000.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n\nAlso, check others just in case:\n\n1. | Purchase20231231001 | Purchase | ... | Paid | ...\n2. | Purchase20231231003 | Purchase | ... | Paid | ...\n3. | Purchase20231231006 | Purchase | ... | Paid | ...\n4. | Purchase20231231009 | Purchase | ... | Paid | ...\n5. | Purchase20231231010 | Purchase | ... | Paid | ...\n6. | Purchase20231231012 | Purchase | ... | Paid | ...\n7. | Purchase20231231016 | Purchase | ... | Paid | ...\n8. | Purchase20231231017 | Purchase | ... | Paid | ...\n9. | Purchase20231231018 | Purchase | ... | Paid | ...\n10. | Purchase20231231020 | Purchase | ... | Paid | ...\n11. | Purchase20231231021 | Purchase | ... | Paid | ...\nAll others are \"Paid\".\n\n#### Also check for any not caught above (possible out-of-sequence or typo):\n\nNone spotted; all unpaid purchases are listed above.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Sum All Unpaid Purchases (Account Payable)\n\nSum the \"amount\" field for all \"Unpaid\" Purchases:\n\nLet's sum step by step:\n\n1. 829,440.0  \n2. 1,250,000.0  \n3. 246,000.0  \n4. 140,800.0  \n5. 254,320.0  \n6. 540,000.0  \n7. 585,000.0  \n8. 755,000.0  \n9. 59,850.0  \n10. 32,850.0  \n11. 19,050.0  \n12. 358,500.0  \n13. 402,000.0  \n\nNow summing:\n\n- 829,440.0  \n+ 1,250,000.0 = 2,079,440.0  \n+ 246,000.0  = 2,325,440.0  \n+ 140,800.0  = 2,466,240.0  \n+ 254,320.0  = 2,720,560.0  \n+ 540,000.0  = 3,260,560.0  \n+ 585,000.0  = 3,845,560.0  \n+ 755,000.0  = 4,600,560.0  \n+ 59,850.0   = 4,660,410.0  \n+ 32,850.0   = 4,693,260.0  \n+ 19,050.0   = 4,712,310.0  \n+ 358,500.0  = 5,070,810.0  \n+ 402,000.0  = 5,472,810.0  \n\n**Total Accounts Payable at End = 5,472,810.00**\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Check for Payments or Settlements \n\nAre there any purchase payment transactions against these unpaid purchases?  \nAll \"Paid\" purchases already have payment status, but the \"Unpaid\" ones above do not show any payments in later periods.  \nNo entries indicating later payment or settlement.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"5472810.00\"} }\n```\n",
