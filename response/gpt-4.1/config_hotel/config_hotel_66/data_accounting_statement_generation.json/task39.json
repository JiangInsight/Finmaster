(from 2024-01-17 to 2024-02-01, inclusive: 16 entries)\n\nBut before that, 2024-01-14~16 have 243.36516 (3 entries).\n\nLet's sum these:\n\n- 243.36516 x 3 = 730.09548\n\nNow sum of 240.15671 x 16:\n- 240.15671 x 16 = 3842.50736\n\nNow, total sum (whole period):\n\n- First 13 = 4494.17248\n- Next 3  = 730.09548\n- Next 16 = 3842.50736\n\nGrand total:\n- 4494.17248 + 730.09548 + 3842.50736 = **9066.77532**\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Ending Interest Receivable\n\nBut actually, in accruals, for the **cash flow adjustment**, what we want is **change from opening to closing balance** for balance sheet item \"Interest Receivable\".\n\n- We started with 0 at 2023-12-31 (from opening balances - no line for Interest Receivable).\n- Each day, an interest receivable is added as \"unpaid\".\n- The **ending balance** of interest receivable at 2024-02-01 would be the sum of all receivables for which cash has NOT yet been received (i.e. total accrued interest not yet collected).\n\nBut in the system, unless some are cleared off/paid, with only \"Interest Receivable\" entries and no \"paid\" status or \"Interest Income: Cash\" lines, we can assume all remain outstanding.\n\nThus, ending Interest Receivable balance at 2024-02-01 is **240.15671** (the last entry).\n\nBut **typically**, since each day a new receivable is added, and unless cash is received to clear some, the ending should be cumulative sum of all daily interest receivable items. But, in practice, often the latest amount is the total **uncollected** Interest Receivable.\n\nLet me confirm if the Interest Receivable is cumulative or not in the cash flow context.\n\n##### Looking at the Example\n\nIn the example you gave, all interest receivable entries were summed, and the (increase) in interest receivable was the negative of that.\n\nIn the example, sum of all \"Interest Receivable\" entries:\n    - 445\n    - 311.5 (x4)\n    - 270.56 (x4)\n    - 141.03345573\n    - -54.76654427\n    - -19.16654427\n    - 16.433455729999984 (x6)\n    - 13.763455729999984\n    - 10.203455729999984 (x2)\n    - -92.14654427\n    - -56.54654427000001\n    - 5.753455729999985\n    - 14.653455729999985\n\nIn the Example, final answer: -2672.87 (which is the negative sum above)\n\nTherefore, for this problem, the cash flow statement shows the (Increase)/Decrease in Interest Receivables as the **sum of all (unpaid, accrued) Interest Receivable entries during the period**.\n\n# Step 4: Final Formula\n\nSo:\n\n> (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable = – (sum of all \"Interest Receivable\" entries in the period)\n\nThus, answer = **–9066.78** (rounded to two decimals)\n\n# Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-9066.78\"} }\n```",
