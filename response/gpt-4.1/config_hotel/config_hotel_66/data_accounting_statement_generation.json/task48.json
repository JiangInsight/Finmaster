Ignore non-cash and accrual items (like unpaid sales, interest receivables, depreciation, etc).\n\n**Include:**\n- Initial cash/bank balances\n- Cash/bank received from PAID sales (i.e., with payment status \"Paid\")\n- Cash/bank spent for PAID purchases (i.e., with payment method \"Cash\", \"Bank Transfer\", or similar, payment status \"Paid\")\n- Cash/bank paid for expenses or any outflow with status \"Paid\" and relevant payment method\n- Do **not** double-count initial balances.\n- Ignore transactions recorded as \"Unpaid\", \"Account Receivable\", \"Account Payable\", and all \"Depreciation\", \"Interest Receivables\" (unless received in cash).\n\n## Step 2: Initial Cash/Bank\n\nFrom data:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.00 (Not cash, not inflow; this is probably an investment of that cash.)\n  - But if this is true, the 8M fixed asset could just be an asset and not an inflow. Usually, capital injection is recorded as equity, so the correct initial balance is the *sum of cash and bank deposits*, i.e., **3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000** as starting balance.\n\nALL OTHER CASH MOVEMENTS to/from this balance (operating, investing, financing cash flows) make up the net increase.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Cash Inflows (Receipts)\n\n**From PAID Sales and other Cash Receipts:**\n\nScan sales marked \"Paid\". For each such sale, the amount is received in cash/bank according to payment method.\n\nLet's process all sales line with \"Paid\" and add their \"amount\" (since sales are mostly cash per description), and sum \"Paid\" expenses and purchases for cash out.\n\nAlternatively, let’s sum up:\n- All \"Paid\" sales (amount)\n- All \"Paid\" purchases (amount) and \"Paid\" expenses (amount) [as outflows]\n\n### Go through Sales (\"Paid\"):\n\nLet's list the \"Paid\" sales (will also ignore those with payment method \"Account Receivable\" or similar):\n\n#### January Sales (\"Paid\")\n\n| id

total for paid \"Expense\": **28,582.30**\n\n### \"Depreciation\" rows\nDEPRECIATION is a non-cash expense - ignore in cash flow.\n\n## Step 5: NET CALCULATION\n\nNow, the cash/bank starting balance is 8,000,000. After all purchases/payments and sales receipts, what's the final net increase?\n\nBut the cash flow statement's \"Net Increase in Cash & Cash Equivalents\" is:  \n(final cash and cash equivalents) – (beginning cash and cash equivalents)\n\nUsually, it's total cash inflows – total cash outflows (during current period), NOT counting the initial capital injection (or, if initial amount is counted as both opening and injected cash, the net zeroes out).\n\nIn this case, let's check if investments (Cash deposit and Bank deposit) should be included. Since they are both \"initial\" on Dec 31, and the fixed asset is not excluded from cash, let's consider only CURRENT PERIOD (Jan onwards, ignoring initial opening).\n\nSo,\n\n- **Beginning cash and cash equivalents = 8,000,000** (from Cash and Bank deposit lines)\n- **Receipts:** 532,721.21\n- **Payments:** Paid purchases: 2,922,960.0 + paid expenses: 28,582.30 = 2,951,542.3\n\nSo,\n\nReceipts minus payments = 532,721.21 - 2,951,542.3 = **-2,418,821.09**\n\nIf you want the net increase (i.e., ending cash minus beginning cash), this is **(ending period cash balance) - (beginning cash balance)**.\n\nBut since there's no capital injection during the period, and only receipts/payments, the above is correct.\n\n## Step 6: Consideration for Initial Cash Impact\n\n**If “Net Increase” is defined from initial cash position, and all the purchases, expenses, and receipts happen after that, then…  \nNet increase = all receipts during the period – all outflows during the period.**\n\n## Step 7: ANSWER\n\n**Net Increase = Receipts – Payments = 532,721.21 – 2,951,542.30 = -2,418,821.09**\n\nExpressed properly:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"-2418821.09\"} }\n```",
