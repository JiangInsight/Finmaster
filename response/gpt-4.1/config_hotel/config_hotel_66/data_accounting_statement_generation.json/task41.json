These DO NOT increase A/P, as their payment has already been made.\n\n**Step 3: Add Up All Credit Purchases**\n\nSum all the \"Unpaid\" purchases:\n\n- 829,440.0\n- 1,250,000.0\n- 246,000.0\n- 140,800.0\n- 254,320.0\n- 540,000.0\n- 585,000.0\n- 755,000.0\n- 59,850.0\n- 32,850.0\n- 19,050.0\n- 358,500.0\n- 402,000.0\n\nSubtotal:\n\nCalculate stepwise:\n\n829,440.0  \n+1,250,000.0 = 2,079,440.0  \n+246,000.0 = 2,325,440.0  \n+140,800.0 = 2,466,240.0  \n+254,320.0 = 2,720,560.0  \n+540,000.0 = 3,260,560.0  \n+585,000.0 = 3,845,560.0  \n+755,000.0 = 4,600,560.0  \n+59,850.0 = 4,660,410.0  \n+32,850.0 = 4,693,260.0  \n+19,050.0 = 4,712,310.0  \n+358,500.0 = 5,070,810.0  \n+402,000.0 = **5,472,810.0**\n\n**Step 4: Did Any Accounts Payable Get Paid Down?**\n\nAre there any \"Payment\" transactions that reduce A/P?  \nLook for any \"Purchase\" with \"Paid\" and \"Account Payable\" (i.e., paying off previously incurred A/P) -- in this dataset, purchases that are paid have payment methods as \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\", not \"Account Payable\" (i.e., no payment on A/P from previous periods or within this period). So without explicit \"A/P paid\" transactions, the entire sum above is the increase (unless otherwise noted).\n\n**Step 5: Initial Balance?**\n\nCheck if A/P had an opening balance. The opening balances (\"Initial\") in the data are only for cash, bank, and fixed assets. NO opening A/P.\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\n\nAll A/P at the end of the period = total purchases on credit = **5,472,810.0**\n\n**Step 7: Solution in Required Format**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"5472810.00\"} }\n```\n",
