What Are Current Liabilities?\nOn a balance sheet, **current liabilities** generally include:  \n- **Accounts Payable** (amounts owed to suppliers/vendors for products/services received, unpaid)\n- **Short-term borrowings or notes payable** (none apparent in data)\n- **Other short-term obligations (tax, wages, etc.)** (not relevant here unless evident)\n- **Interest Payable / Interest Receivable** (only if interest \"payable\" -- here, \"Interest Receivables\" is an asset, not a liability)\n\nIn your dataset, the **main current liabilities are \"Accounts Payable\"** recorded as \"Unpaid\" purchases.  \n\n## 2. Initial Value of Current Liabilities (as of 2023-12-31)\nLook for any explicit liabilities at initial balance sheet date (2023-12-31):\n\n- Entries with Initial20231231001: Only lists **Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets**.  \n- No payable/unpaid or liability at initial point.\n\n**â†’ Therefore, Initial Value = 0.00**\n\n---\n\n## 3. End Value of Current Liabilities (as of 2024-01-31 / 2024-02-01)\nSum the value of all **currently unpaid purchases** (Accounts Payable).\n\n### Criteria:\n- Type: Purchase\n- Payment/receipt_status: Unpaid (i.e. not 'Paid')\n- Account Payable (usually under Payment_Method or Cost_per_unit)\n- The purchase must still be outstanding (there's no evidence in this journal it was subsequently settled/paid within this period)\n\nLet's sum all relevant entries:\n\n### List of All Unpaid Purchases (from above table):\n**(I'll list by Purchase ID, Amount, Short explain)**\n\n#### (2023-12-31 Purchases with 'Unpaid')\n| Purchase20231231002 | Purchase | ... | 829440.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n| Purchase20231231004 | Purchase | ... | 1250000.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n| Purchase20231231005 | Purchase | ... | 246000.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n| Purchase20231231007 | Purchase | ... | 140800.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n| Purchase20231231008 | Purchase | ... | 254320.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n| Purchase20231231011 | Purchase | ... | 540000.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n| Purchase20231231013 | Purchase | ... | 585000.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n| Purchase20231231014 | Purchase | ... | 755000.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n| Purchase20231231015 | Purchase | ... | 59850.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n| Purchase20231231019 | Purchase | ... | 32850.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n| Purchase20231231022 | Purchase | ... | 19050.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n| Purchase20231231023 | Purchase | ... | 358500.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n| Purchase20231231024 | Purchase | ... | 402000.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n\n#### Total:  \nLet's sum these:\n\n- 829,440.00\n- 1,250,000.00\n- 246,000.00\n- 140,800.00\n- 254,320.00\n- 540,000.00\n- 585,000.00\n- 755,000.00\n- 59,850.00\n- 32,850.00\n- 19,050.00\n- 358,500.00\n- 402,000.00\n\nAdd them step-by-step:\n\n| Step         | Amount      | Running Total   |\n|--------------|-------------|----------------|\n| 1            | 829,440.00  |   829,440.00   |\n| 2            | 1,250,000.00| 2,079,440.00   |\n| 3            |   246,000.00| 2,325,440.00   |\n| 4            |   140,800.00| 2,466,240.00   |\n| 5            |   254,320.00| 2,720,560.00   |\n| 6            |   540,000.00| 3,260,560.00   |\n| 7            |   585,000.00| 3,845,560.00   |\n| 8            |   755,000.00| 4,600,560.00   |\n| 9            |    59,850.00| 4,660,410.00   |\n|10            |    32,850.00| 4,693,260.00   |\n|11            |    19,050.00| 4,712,310.00   |\n|12            |   358,500.00| 5,070,810.00   |\n|13            |   402,000.00| 5,472,810.00   |\n\n**Total Current Liabilities (End Value) = 5,472,810.00**\n\n---\n\n## 4. Any Reductions?   \nAre there any **payments for previously owed/unpaid purchases?**  \nLooking through cash (i.e. \"Purchase\" with \"Paid\") vs. those above, there is NO journal showing a payment of any of the above \"unpaid\" (Account Payable) items after initial purchase.  \n- All 'Paid' purchases are separate, and the above \"Unpaid\" remain unpaid through this period.\n\nThus, the above total holds.\n\n## 5. Other Adjustments?  \nNothing else (no evident short-term loans, nor current tax/wages payable, nor other current liabilities in provided records).  \nInterest Receivables: is an asset, not a liability.  \nNo \"Advances from customers\" or \"Short-term loans\" listed.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Final Formatting  \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"5472810.00\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"5472810.00\"} }\n```",
