Definition:\n**Paid-in Capital** (Contributed Capital) is the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares. It usually originates with the company's incorporation and is generally unaffected by subsequent operating transactions unless there are additional capital injections (new shares issued or direct capital increases), or returns of capital. It is not affected by ordinary business transactions (sales, purchases, expenses, depreciation, etc).\n\n### 2. Identify Initial Paid-in Capital:\nLook for transactions at or near the end of the previous period (2023-12-31) with \"Initial\" in the id/type or which clearly make up initial capital.\n\n#### From data:\n- `Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit         | 2023-12-31 | 3,000,000.0`\n- `Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit         | 2023-12-31 | 5,000,000.0`\n- `Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets         | 2023-12-31 | 8,000,000.0`\n\nSum = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 8,000,000 = **16,000,000.00**\n\n>This represents total initial shareholder-equity investment (\"Paid-in Capital\"). The combination of assets (cash, deposits, fixed assets) at incorporation is a common way to record initial paid-in capital.\n\n### 3. Check for changes to Paid-in Capital:\n- Look for any subsequent transactions that clearly indicate additional paid-in capital: e.g., \"Capital Increase\", \"Share Subscription\", \"Share Issue\", \"Paid-in Capital\", \"Owner Investment\", etc.\n- **None** are found in the transaction list. All later items involve regular operations (purchases, sales, expenses, depreciation, interest, etc.) which do NOT change Paid-in Capital.\n\n### 4. Confirm End Value:\n- Since there are NO further injections/withdrawals of capital in the transaction list, the end value remains the same.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Paid-in Capital Initial Value:** 16,000,000.00  \n**Paid-in Capital End Value:** 16,000,000.00\n\nNo change. \n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\", \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"16000000.00\"}}\n```",
