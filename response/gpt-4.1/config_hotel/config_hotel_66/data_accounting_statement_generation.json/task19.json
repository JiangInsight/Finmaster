Net Calculation\n\nBy the accounting equation:\n\n**Closing Total Liabilities & Owners' Equity =**\n\n= Initial Assets  \n+ Purchases  \n+ Sales (since goods are transferred, asset is replaced: inventory decreases, cash or AR increases)  \n+ Interest Receivable (asset)  \n- Paid Expenses  \n- Depreciation (asset decrease)  \n\nBut assets also decrease when purchases are paid for, but since we also increase with purchases, and we use 'Inventory' as the asset, we'll need to consider paid/unpaid accounts.\n\nBut for total as per the equation, the sum of all asset accounts gets us the value.\n\n#### SALES\nSales increase asset only if cash or AR increases; it's already accounted in the cash flows. Since we're summing the asset cash flow, sales are proceeds to cash or AR, but inventory is reduced (cost amount).\n\nHence, for net worth, *profits from sales* accumulate into retained earnings (owners equity increases by profit, cash/AR increases by full amount, inventory decreases by cost).\n\nTherefore, for net change, the only additions to ownersâ€™ equity via operations are 'Profit' columns in the sales rows.\n\n#### Step 3: Plug the Final Equity\n\n**A more robust shortcut:**\n- Initial sum: 16,000,000.00\n- Purchases: All increase inventory (or asset).\n- Expenses: Decrease cash/bank, but also reduce ownerâ€™s equity.\n- Depreciation: Reduces fixed assets, reduces ownerâ€™s equity.\n- Profits (from sales): Increase ownerâ€™s equity.\n\nSo, to get final value, the fastest, most reliable method is:\n**Initial value\n+ sum of all profits from sales (from all 'Sale' rows' 'profit')\n- sum of all expenses (of any kind, from all 'Expense' rows)\n- sum of all depreciation entries\n= Closing total liabilities and owners equity**\n\nLetâ€™s collect:\n#### a. Sum of all profits (from all sales)\n\nSum the 'profit' field for all 'Sale' rows.\n\nLooking at a sample (adding a few at a time):\n\n| profit         |\n|----------------|\n| 7,299.04       |\n| 5,809.28       |\n| 5,264.30       |\n| 4,149.78       |\n| 456.24         |\n| 1,734.92       |\n| 815.95         |\n| 8,836.04       |\n| 6,525.24       |\n| 10,700.75      |\n| 5,092.72       |\n| 5,444.46       |\n| 2,783.40       |\n| 2,236.52       |\n| 514.62         |\n| 4,360.20       |\n| 1,703.10       |\n| 8,883.20       |\n| 3,373.75       |\n| 4,031.95       |\n| 4,001.01       |\n| 991.62         |\n| 1,148.60       |\n| 1,034.92       |\n| 4,538.38       |\n| 5,500.95       |\n| 1,019.58       |\n| 1,602.81       |\n| 1,096.61       |\n| 337.02         |\n| 5,615.08       |\n| 2,587.35       |\n| 1,065.32       |\n| 3,083.80       |\n| 3,449.92       |\n| 12,191.88      |\n| 781.00         |\n| 19,676.85      |\n| 618.88         |\n| 2,749.42       |\n| 1,213.44       |\n| 3,910.85       |\n| 2,252.08       |\n| 249.20         |\n| 2,016.54       |\n| 246.76         |\n| 1,439.50       |\n| 780.94         |\n| 4,763.44       |\n| 7,426.90       |\n| 913.06         |\n| 11,728.28      |\n| 2,565.22       |\n| 246.76         |\n| 6,475.05       |\n| 925.83         |\n| 1,978.94       |\n| 1,409.79       |\n| 1,602.30       |\n| 1,944.90       |\n| 3,393.83       |\n| 520.57         |\n| 253.23         |\n\nLet's add some:\nFirst, sum 10 sales:\n\n7,299.04 + 5,809.28 = 13,108.32  \n+ 5,264.30 = 18,372.62  \n+ 4,149.78 = 22,522.40  \n+ 456.24 = 22,978.64  \n+ 1,734.92 = 24,713.56  \n+ 815.95 = 25,529.51  \n+ 8,836.04 = 34,365.55  \n+ 6,525.24 = 40,890.79  \n+ 10,700.75 = 51,591.54  \nNext 10:\n+ 5,092.72 = 56,684.26  \n+ 5,444.46 = 62,128.72  \n+ 2,783.40 = 64,912.12  \n+ 2,236.52 = 67,148.64  \n+ 514.62 = 67,663.26  \n+ 4,360.20 = 72,023.46  \n+ 1,703.10 = 73,726.56  \n+ 8,883.20 = 82,609.76  \n+ 3,373.75 = 85,983.51  \n+ 4,031.95 = 90,015.46  \nNext group:\n\n+ 4,001.01 = 94,016.47  \n+ 991.62 = 95,008.09  \n+ 1,148.60 = 96,156.69  \n+ 1,034.92 = 97,191.61  \n+ 4,538.38 = 101,729.99  \n+ 5,500.95 = 107,230.94  \n+ 1,019.58 = 108,250.52  \n+ 1,602.81 = 109,853.33  \n+ 1,096.61 = 110,949.94  \n+ 337.02 = 111,286.96  \n\nAdd next:\n\n+ 5,615.08 = 116,902.04  \n+ 2,587.35 = 119,489.39  \n+ 1,065.32 = 120,554.71  \n+ 3,083.80 = 123,638.51  \n+ 3,449.92 = 127,088.43  \n+12,191.88 = 139,280.31  \n+ 781.00 = 140,061.31  \n+19,676.85 = 159,738.16  \n+ 618.88 = 160,357.04  \n+ 2,749.42 = 163,106.46  \n\nContinue:\n\n+ 1,213.44 = 164,319.90  \n+ 3,910.85 = 168,230.75  \n+ 2,252.08 = 170,482.83  \n+ 249.20 = 170,732.03  \n+ 2,016.54 = 172,748.57  \n+ 246.76 = 172,995.33  \n+ 1,439.50 = 174,434.83  \n+ 780.94  = 175,215.77  \n+ 4,763.44 = 179,979.21  \n+ 7,426.90 = 187,406.11  \n\nNow finish off:\n\n+ 913.06 = 188,319.17  \n+11,728.28 = 200,047.45  \n+ 2,565.22 = 202,612.67  \n+ 246.76 = 202,859.43  \n+ 6,475.05 = 209,334.48  \n+ 925.83 = 210,260.31  \n+ 1,978.94 = 212,239.25  \n+ 1,409.79 = 213,649.04  \n+ 1,602.30 = 215,251.34  \n+ 1,944.90 = 217,196.24  \n+ 3,393.83 = 220,590.07  \n+ 520.57 = 221,110.64  \n+ 253.23 = 221,363.87\n\n**Total Profit from Sales: 221,363.87**\n\n#### d. Sum of all Expenses (already calculated above): 27,415.50\n\n#### e. Total Depreciation: 91,509.94\n\n#### f. Interest: Not part of profit, but increases AR asset; it doesn't affect owners equity, but does affect closing assets and so total Liabilities & Owners Equity\n\nWe already summed interest: 8,586.46\n\n#### Final Value\n\n**Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value =**  \nInitial: 16,000,000.00  \n+ Profits: 221,363.87  \n- Expenses: 27,415.50  \n- Depreciation: 91,509.94\n\nBut as per the accounting equation (since profits are not double-counted in assets), the net addition to Equity is net profits (Total Sales Profits - Expenses - Depreciation). Interest Receivable total (8,586.46) is already included as an asset.\n\nSo, let's do the calculations step by step:\n\n1. Add all purchases:  \n(The purchases are asset exchanges: cash/bank out, asset/inventory in, sum unchanged.)\n2. Add all sales:  \n(Cash/AR increases, inventory decreases by cost, profit is added to equity.)\n3. Interest: increases AR (asset).\n4. Expenses: cash/bank out, decreases both asset and equity.\n5. Depreciation: fixed asset down, equity down.\n\nActually, the quick accounting equation for the balance sheet is:\n- Closing assets = starting assets + purchases + sales (cash or AR) + interest receivable (AR) - expenses paid - depreciation.\n- Closing total liabilities & equity matches closing assets.\n\nBut since owner equity increases only by net profit (sum of profits - expenses - depreciation), and purchases are just inter-asset transfers, the shortcut is:\n\n**END = Initial + Net Profit - Depreciation**\n\nWhere net profit = Total Sales Profits - Expenses.\n\nSo:\nNet profit before depreciation = 221,363.87 - 27,415.50 = 193,948.37\n\nAfter depreciation: 193,948.37 - 91,509.94 = 102,438.43\n\nTotal liabilities & owners equity at end: 16,000,000.00 + 102,438.43 = **16,102,438.43**\n\nBut, *Interest Receivable* increases AR (asset) by 8,586.46, so the final assets and thus liabilities/equity must also include this:\n\nSo, **final total = 16,102,438.43 + 8,586.46 = 16,111,024.89**\n\n(Rounding to 2 decimals)\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Final JSON Solution\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\", \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"16111024.89\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Explanation of Approach\n- Initial value: as per initial balance sheet (\"Initial\" type rows).\n- Changes: only profits from business and increase in AR via interest add net value; purchases/sales are asset swaps and expenses/depreciation reduce equity.\n- Used all profit values from sales, added up all expenses, all depreciation, all interest receivables (as they stay on balance sheet).\n- Final value = all increases/decreases as per accounting equation.\n\n**If any negative 'Interest Receivables' are present, subtract their sum (there are none shown in this problem).**\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\", \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"16111024.89\"} }\n```",
