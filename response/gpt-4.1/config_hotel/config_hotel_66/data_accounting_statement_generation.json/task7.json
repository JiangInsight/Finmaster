Find the Initial Fixed Asset Balance\n\nLook for the row:\n\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | ... | 8000000.0 ...|\n\nSo,\n- **Initial Balance = 8,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Identify Additions (Purchases) to Fixed Assets\n\nSearch for purchases (type = Purchase) that are of long-term nature (not consumables). In this problem, the names and units (per set, per room) like Banquet Set, Business Meal Set, Quick Meal Set, Business Room, etc., suggest they're likely to be fixed assets for a hotel/catering business.\n\nWe sum all purchases with relevant categories BEFORE the end period (assuming all purchases are considered capitalized unless specified otherwise).\n\nLet's extract all such purchases after the initial value's date (but here, initial is for 2023-12-31), so purchases on the same date are considered additions.\n\n\n#### All \"Purchase\" transactions (from the data):\n\n| id                | amount   | product_name      |\n|-------------------|----------|-------------------|\n| Purchase...001    | 371,520  | Banquet Set       |\n| Purchase...002    | 829,440  | Banquet Set       |\n| Purchase...003    | 35,000   | Business Meal Set |\n| Purchase...004    |1,250,000 | Luxury Suite      |\n| Purchase...005    | 246,000  | Business Room     |\n| Purchase...006    | 582,000  | Business Room     |\n| Purchase...007    | 140,800  | Deluxe Meal Set   |\n| Purchase...008    | 254,320  | Deluxe Meal Set   |\n| Purchase...009    | 240,240  | Deluxe Meal Set   |\n| Purchase...010    | 216,000  | Standard Room     |\n| Purchase...011    | 540,000  | Luxury Suite      |\n| Purchase...013    | 585,000  | Luxury Suite      |\n| Purchase...014    | 755,000  | Luxury Suite      |\n| Purchase...015    | 59,850   | Business Meal Set |\n| Purchase...016    | 820,800  | Banquet Set       |\n| Purchase...017    | 80,500   | Business Meal Set |\n| Purchase...018    | 328,000  | Business Room     |\n| Purchase...019    | 32,850   | Quick Meal Set    |\n| Purchase...020    | 36,050   | Business Meal Set |\n| Purchase...021    | 35,850   | Quick Meal Set    |\n| Purchase...022    | 19,050   | Quick Meal Set    |\n| Purchase...023    | 358,500  | Standard Room     |\n| Purchase...024    | 402,000  | Standard Room     |\n\nNow, sum up all these purchase amounts:\n\n371,520  \n+ 829,440  \n+ 35,000\n+ 1,250,000\n+ 246,000\n+ 582,000\n+ 140,800\n+ 254,320\n+ 240,240\n+ 216,000\n+ 540,000\n+ 585,000\n+ 755,000\n+ 59,850\n+ 820,800\n+ 80,500\n+ 328,000\n+ 32,850\n+ 36,050\n+ 35,850\n+ 19,050\n+ 358,500\n+ 402,000\n\nLet's compute this step-by-step:\n\n371,520  \n+ 829,440  = 1,200,960  \n+ 35,000   = 1,235,960  \n+1,250,000 = 2,485,960  \n+ 246,000  = 2,731,960  \n+ 582,000  = 3,313,960  \n+ 140,800  = 3,454,760  \n+ 254,320  = 3,709,080  \n+ 240,240  = 3,949,320  \n+ 216,000  = 4,165,320  \n+ 540,000  = 4,705,320  \n+ 585,000  = 5,290,320  \n+ 755,000  = 6,045,320  \n+ 59,850   = 6,105,170  \n+ 820,800  = 6,925,970  \n+ 80,500   = 7,006,470  \n+ 328,000  = 7,334,470  \n+ 32,850   = 7,367,320  \n+ 36,050   = 7,403,370  \n+ 35,850   = 7,439,220  \n+ 19,050   = 7,458,270  \n+ 358,500  = 7,816,770  \n+ 402,000  = 8,218,770  \n\nSo, **Total Purchases = 8,218,770.00**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Less: Depreciation\n\nLocate Depreciation transactions:\n\n- Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | ... | 45,754.08\n- Depreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | ... | 45,755.86\n\nSum: 45,754.08 + 45,755.86 = **91,509.94**\n\n---\n\n### 4. Compute the Final Fixed Asset Value\n\n#### Formula:\nFinal value = Initial Value  \n+ Additions (Purchases)  \n– Depreciation\n\nInsert the numbers:\n\nFinal value = 8,000,000.00  \n+ 8,218,770.00  \n–   91,509.94  \n\n\n\nLet's do the math:\n\n8,000,000.00  \n+8,218,770.00 = 16,218,770.00  \n-   91,509.94 = 16,127,260.06\n\n---\n\n## Final Output\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"16127260.06\"} }\n```",
