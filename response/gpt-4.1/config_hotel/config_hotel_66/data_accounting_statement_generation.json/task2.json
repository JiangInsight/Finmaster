Purchases paid via Bank Transfer**\n\n| id                  | type     | amount     | paid? |\n|---------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | Purchase | 371,520.0  | Paid (Bank Transfer)     |\n| Purchase20231231003 | Purchase | 35,000.0   | Paid (Bank Transfer)     |\n| Purchase20231231006 | Purchase | 582,000.0  | Paid (Bank Transfer)     |\n| Purchase20231231009 | Purchase | 240,240.0  | Paid (Bank Transfer)     |\n| Purchase20231231010 | Purchase | 216,000.0  | Paid (Bank Transfer)     |\n| Purchase20231231016 | Purchase | 820,800.0  | Paid (Bank Transfer)     |\n| Purchase20231231020 | Purchase | 36,050.0   | Paid (Bank Transfer)     |\n\n**Total Bank Transfer Out:**\n\nWe sum them:\n\n- 371,520.00\n- 35,000.00\n- 582,000.00\n- 240,240.00\n- 216,000.00\n- 820,800.00\n- 36,050.00\n\n**Sum:**\n\nLet's add stepwise:\n\n371,520.00  \n+ 35,000.00 = 406,520.00  \n+ 582,000.00 = 988,520.00  \n+ 240,240.00 = 1,228,760.00  \n+ 216,000.00 = 1,444,760.00  \n+ 820,800.00 = 2,265,560.00  \n+ 36,050.00 = 2,301,610.00  \n\n**Total Bank Out: 2,301,610.00**\n\n\n---\n\n### **B. Any Bank Inflows (Besides Initial)?**\n\n- Sales are mostly Cash (i.e. not directly into bank), some are \"unpaid\" (accounts receivable), NOT bank.\n- No item seems like bank interest or transfer-in.\n- None of the \"Interest Receivables\" lines are actual cash receipts to bank yet (they are receivable only).\n\n**So, NO inflows to bank except initial deposit.**\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Final Calculation**\n\n**Bank Deposit at End = Initial Bank Deposit - Paid Purchases via Bank Transfer**\n\n= **5,000,000.00 - 2,301,610.00**\n\n= **2,698,390.00**\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Double Check For Other Outflows**\n\n- Purchases paid via CASH are not from bank.\n- Purchases paid via Account Payable are not paid yet.\n- Expenses: All paid via CASH, no operation via BANK.\n\n**No other outflows from bank. Confirmed.**\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Answer in Required Format**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"2698390.00\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"2698390.00\"} }\n```",
