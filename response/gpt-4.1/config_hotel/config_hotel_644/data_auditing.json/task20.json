It is an opening balance entry, not a fixed asset purchase, and likely the recorded category and description are inconsistent with the standardized (invoice) source. The correct category should be \"Initial Investment\" (or similar).\n- The row for `Purchase20231231013` is marked as \"Financial Expenses\" but the invoice clearly describes a purchase and gives quantity, unit price, and total matching a purchase record, not a financial expense. The correct category is \"Purchase\". Also, the unit price in the invoice is 2000.0, while the recorded unit price (recorded_unit_price field) is 2180.79. The recorded value is incorrect and should match the invoice value of 2000.0.\n",
