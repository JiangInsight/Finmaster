This matches, so no inconsistency here, but all 3 entries with same id and different categories and amounts suggest a possible data recording issue — perhaps the original intention was to have one Initial entry or properly split among asset types.)\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": \"Sale20240109023\",\n        \"Incorrect field(s)\": [\n            \"recorded_quantity\",\n            \"recorded_payment/receipt_status\",\n            \"recorded_profit\"\n        ],\n        \"Recorded quantity\": \"1.0\",\n        \"Original quantity\": \"2.0\",\n        \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n        \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n        \"Recorded profit\": \"358.46\",\n        \"Original profit\": \"290.36\",\n        \"Estimated correct value\": {\n            \"recorded_quantity\": \"2.0\",\n            \"recorded_payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n            \"recorded_profit\": \"290.36\"\n        }\n    }\n]}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- For Initial20231231001, the three different entries with same id but different asset types, each with distinct amounts, could be a recording method (asset allocation of initial funds), but more likely indicates a data structure or input issue. However, total amounts sum up as per \"fixed assets\" line and the invoice descriptions, so technically there's no calculation inconsistency—just a structural/categorization redundancy possible.\n\n- For Sale20240109023, the invoice (which is prioritized as reliable) describes *2 units* at 495.18 each totaling *990.36* (matches description), but the recorded_quantity field is \"1.0\", and the payment/receipt_status is marked as \"Paid\" when the invoice says \"Unpaid\". The recorded_profit is 358.46, but by calculation with two units it should be 290.36 as per the invoice narrative. Thus, the original/correct values are as per the invoice, and the recorded fields need correction.\n\n*Other entries checked do not feature internal inconsistency within a single row between the structured fields and the invoice narrative.*",
