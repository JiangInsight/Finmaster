Cash deposit, amount 3,000,000\n  2. Bank deposit, amount 5,000,000\n  3. Fixed Assets, amount **8,000,000** (in \"Recorded amount\") â€” but the line \"an invoice was issued for a Fixed Assets, totaling $5,000,000.00.\"\n- The sum of Cash deposit and Bank deposit equals 8,000,000, which might have been mistakenly entered in the Fixed Assets row as the transaction amount.\n- The invoice (often most reliable) states Fixed Assets is 5,000,000.\n- Therefore, in the third row, \"Fixed Assets\" line, the correct ('Original') amount should be 5,000,000, not 8,000,000.\n- All other fields seem internally consistent for all three lines.\n\n### Output:\n\n- id: Initial20231231001\n- Incorrect field: recorded_amount\n- Recorded value: 8,000,000.0\n- Best estimate of correct value: 5,000,000.0 (from invoice and pattern)\n- All other fields: null, as no inconsistency detected.",
