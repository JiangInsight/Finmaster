Each line's amount should match its respective invoice description. For Fixed Assets, the invoice clearly says $5000000.00, but the recorded amount for 'Fixed Assets' row is $8000000.0.

If you require unused fields to be explicitly filled (as in your example), I can do so as well.  \n\nLet me know if you'd like all possible inconsistency fields filled (even those not in the example).",
