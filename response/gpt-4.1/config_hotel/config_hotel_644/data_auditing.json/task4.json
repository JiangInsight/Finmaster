Type: Cash deposit, amount: 3,000,000.00\n    2. Type: Bank deposit, amount: 5,000,000.00\n    3. Type: Fixed Assets, amount: 8,000,000.00\n\n- For the first two, amounts are consistent with the invoice description.\n- For the third row (`Fixed Assets`), the amount recorded as `8,000,000.0` does not match the sum of the prior two deposits (3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000). This suggests all funds went to Fixed Assets, which could be correct.\n\n- However, the **main inconsistency** is that:\n    - For the `Fixed Assets` row, the field `recorded_payment_method` is blank (not populated). Normally, there would be a method of payment (e.g., Cash, Bank Transfer) associated with capitalizing a fixed asset acquisition of this magnitude, especially since the other two entries with the same id do not specify that these amounts are actually asset acquisitions, but only \"deposits\".\n    - The invoice field and the aggregate logic suggest this was an *asset capitalization*, yet the field is missing.\n\n- No numeric discrepancies, but there is a key field missing likely due to data entry oversight (i.e., dropped field).\n\nTherefore, the most probable correct value for `recorded_payment_method` should be \"Fixed Assets\" (or perhaps \"Cash & Bank\" if split). Since for the \"type\" we have \"Fixed Assets\", and no method, it's most likely the payment method was omitted, and it could be assumed to be the aggregate of the prior two: \"Cash & Bank\".\n\n**Summary row (for the most significant error above):**\n- id: Initial20231231001\n- Incorrect field: recorded_payment_method\n- Recorded value: (blank)\n- Best estimate/correction: \"Cash & Bank\" (or detail as \"Cash\" and \"Bank\" each for the respective amounts, in reference to the other two lines in the set, if keeping split is required.)\n\n---\n\n**If you are looking for only strictly numeric errors:**  \nThere is **no numeric mismatch** for amounts in these three entries.\n\n**If you are looking for missing field errors with likely values:**  \nAs above, the payment method is omitted for the Fixed Assets entry but should reflect the source of funds - in this context, \"Cash & Bank deposit\".\n\n---\n\n**Final output (filling in fields as per required format, only for the main detected inconsistency):**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": \"Cash & Bank\", \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"8000000.0\", \"Recorded amount\": \"8000000.0\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Initial20231231001\"} }\n```\n**(If you expect only strictly detected errors - only the payment_method missing for the asset capitalization row is a certain inconsistency.)**",
