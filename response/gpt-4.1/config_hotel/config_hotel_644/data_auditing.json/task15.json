In reality, initial investment is split as cash + bank = total initial asset injection, which should match fixed assets.\n   - The inconsistency is the same id used for what are logically the dual entries of one initial capital injection (should be 8,000,000 total).\n   - Best estimate: keep Cash and Bank deposit as is, ensure Fixed Assets equals sum (which it does).\n\n2. **For Sale20240105011:**  \n   - Recorded as type 'Depreciation', amount 448.78, quantity 2.0.\n   - Invoice clearly states it is a Sale, 3 units at 224.39 = 673.17.\n   - This suggests someone recorded the transaction as depreciation and only for 2 units (value matches 224.39*2).\n   - Best estimate: use 'Sale', 3.0 units, amount 673.17 (per invoice, which is more reliable).\n\n**Other inconsistencies were not found, as all other entries sampled and checked (unit x price = amount, cost matches units and product, etc) aligned with their invoice narrative or fields. Only type/quantity mismatches as above are observed.**\n\nIf you need all error fields filled out in the original sample's long style, let me know!",
