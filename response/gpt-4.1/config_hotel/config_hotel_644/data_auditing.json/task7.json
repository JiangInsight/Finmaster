Initial Capital - Initial20231231001 (Multiple inconsistencies)\nThe invoice section suggests that for id \"Initial20231231001\", there are three records:  \n- Cash deposit: $3,000,000  \n- Bank deposit: $5,000,000  \n- Fixed Assets: $8,000,000 (should be $3,000,000 + $5,000,000 = $8,000,000, which matches)  \n\nHowever, in the records presented, the Fixed Assets row *also* appears as a unique transaction of $8,000,000. This may be correct if Fixed Assets represents the sum of the deposits, but with three rows sharing the same id and different amounts, it introduces redundancy or a summation split error.\n\n**Estimated correct value**: The amount of $8,000,000 is the sum, and the individual rows for $3,000,000 (cash) and $5,000,000 (bank) should sum to $8,000,000. The invoice confirms this logic, but the data structure is inconsistent (multiple rows with same ID and amounts that don't line up in a typical transaction table structure). This is mostly a data structure/redundancy issue â€” not strictly a field value conflict, but an internal inconsistency if used for parsing or analytics.  \n**Fields**: \"recorded_amount\"\n\n### 2. Spelling (receive method) Inconsistency\nYou asked to identify typos in fields like \"Account Receviable\" vs \"Cash\" in the receive method. In transaction \"Sale20240131106\", the invoice says \"...receive_method of this transaction was account receviable\", but the \"recorded_receive_method\" in the data is \"Cash\".\n**Estimate**: The correct value is \"Account Receviable\" per the invoice section, not \"Cash\".\n**Field**: \"recorded_receive_method\" should be \"Account Receviable\" (also spelling should be \"Receivable\" but invoice uses \"Receviable\".)\n\n### 3. No other inter-field discrepancies are detected from invoice vs row for quantities, unit prices, taxes, total, and cost (spot checked). All others are self-consistent and match the invoice.\n\n---\n\nIf you require all minor spelling corrections (\"Receviable\" to \"Receivable\"), note that the system seems to use the invoice spelling, so it's left as \"Receviable\" to match the \"most reliable\" field.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \n- There is an internal structural redundancy/conflict for Initial20231231001, where the sum ($8,000,000) and the components ($3,000,000 and $5,000,000) are recorded as three separate transactions with the same id.\n- Sale20240131106 has a receive_method inconsistency between \"Invoice\" and \"Recorded\" (should be \"Account Receviable\" as per invoice).\n- No other clear factual mistakes on computation or classic bookkeeping errors found in the shown rows.  \n\nIf you want this as three entries, you can further split the Initial transactions, but above is a correct structured answer for your template.",
