Thus, this is consistent, even if unusual structurally.\n   - **Resolution:** There is *no* error in the amount for the Fixed Assets line as per the invoice. \n   - But: The three lines record the same id and date, and are all referenced in the same invoice context (\"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a ...\"), yet have different amounts and types. In classical bookkeeping, initial capital would sum to one entry for each distinct asset type, but it's possible Cash and Bank entries are being split and their total funds the fixed assets. This groupingâ€™s structure is not internally erroneous per the rules of the task (\"per row\").\n\n2. **Sale20240201109:**  \n   - The invoice reads: \"an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 3.0 units at a unit price of $1311.03, totaling $3933.09. The cost amount for this transaction was $2640.00, with a tax amount of $196.65, leading to a total amount due of $3736.44.\"\n   - However, in the table:\n     - recorded_quantity = 2.0, recorded_unit_price = 1311.03, recorded_amount = 2622.06\n   - This conflicts: the invoice says 3.0 units, but the data row says 2.0 units, and the amount is also less than the invoice.\n   - **Best estimate of correct value(s):**\n     - recorded_quantity should be 3.0\n     - recorded_amount should be 3933.09\n   - All other fields match the invoice and calculation.\n   - **This matches the example risk_issues in your raw dataset.**\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Only Sale20240201109 has a clear intra-row inconsistency, where the quantity and amount do not match the invoice, which is considered more reliable.\n- The triple-entry for 'Initial20231231001' is a highly unusual (but not data-error) split for start-of-period entries, but no row-by-row error appears by the inner-row rules established by the invoice being matched.\n\nIf you want only the Sale20240201109 record (as in your sample), reply only with that one. Otherwise, this answer includes both and confirms no other internal mismatches are evident by the rules of the task.",
