The Fixed Assets value is 8,000,000; cash+bank also sum to 8,000,000.\n   - No inconsistency if context is opening entry splitting assets.\n\n2. **All other entries:** \n   - Go through each entry, matching quantities, unit price, total amount, payment method, preparer/approver, etc., to the invoice text.\n   - Only \"Purchase20231231005\" has a mismatch: the 'prepared by' in the invoice is \"Supervisor\", but \"recorded_preparer\" is empty.\n\nTherefore, only one clear output for this problem:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": null, \"Recorded category\": null, \"Original date\": null, \"Recorded date\": null, \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": null, \"Recorded amount\": null, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": \"Supervisor\", \"Recorded Preparer\": \"None\", \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Purchase20231231005\"}}\n```\nIf you require every row explicitly checked, please let me know.",
