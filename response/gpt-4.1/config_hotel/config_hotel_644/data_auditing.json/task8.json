According to the standard accounting treatment, Initial capital introduction is usually the sum of the cash and bank deposits, which is then used to purchase fixed assets (not added together).\n- However, from the invoice, it shows \"an invoice was issued for a Fixed Assets, totaling $5000000.00\", but the recorded_amount is 8000000.0 for the Fixed Assets.\n- Thus, the invoice amount (considered more authoritative) for Fixed Assets is $5,000,000.00, but the recorded value was $8,000,000.00.\n- The other lines for Cash deposit and Bank deposit match their invoice, so are not in error.\n- Therefore, the error is in the `recorded_amount` for \"Fixed Assets\", which should be 5,000,000.00. All other fields match.\n- Only one field is inconsistent in one row.\n\n**If you want other discrepancies in this data set identified, please provide which specific row(s) to investigate.**",
