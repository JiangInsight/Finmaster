Cash deposit, 3,000,000.00\n  2. Bank deposit, 5,000,000.00\n  3. Fixed Assets, **8,000,000.00** (recorded), but invoice: \"an invoice was issued for a Fixed Assets, totaling $5,000,000.00.\"\n- The Fixed Assets row has a mismatch between recorded_amount (8,000,000.00) and the invoice total (5,000,000.00).\n- Given invoices are more reliable, the correct value should be 5,000,000.00.\n- All other fields in the sample are matching for their respective rows.\n- There are no other internal inconsistencies in this portion provided.\n\n**If a full list is expected:**\nYou may apply this template, as shown in the previous Examples, for any other row where the invoice (which is the most reliable) and the recorded fields do not match. In this data, only the above row within the provided sample is inconsistent.",
