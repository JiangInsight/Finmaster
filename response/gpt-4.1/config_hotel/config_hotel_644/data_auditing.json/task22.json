However, it highlights a potential issueâ€”may need to adjust based on actual assets/cash per supporting docs.\n\n2. **ID: Sale20240112035**\n    - Recorded date is \"2024-02-02\", but invoice text says \"On January 12, 2024...\"; also, the corresponding 'recorded_unit_price' is 2365.85, but the correct amount is 2821.83 (matches recorded_amount and invoice text for 1 unit).\n    - Thus, both the date and unit price are inconsistent with the reliable fields (amount, invoice).\n\n**If you need more such entries beyond the ones previously flagged, let me know!**",
