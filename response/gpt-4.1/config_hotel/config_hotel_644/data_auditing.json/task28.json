Initial20231231001 (Fixed Assets row)\n- Three rows have the same id \"Initial20231231001\" with types: \"Cash deposit\" ($3,000,000), \"Bank deposit\" ($5,000,000), and \"Fixed Assets\" ($8,000,000).\n- Invoice for \"Fixed Assets\" instructs \"totaling $8,000,000\".\n- However, the sum of \"Cash deposit\" and \"Bank deposit\" is EXACTLY $8,000,000 ($3,000,000 + $5,000,000).\n- In typical accounting entries, the sum of deposits matches the increase in Fixed Assets.\n- The likely correct Fixed Asset value is $5,000,000 (based on the \"Bank deposit\") or (less reasonably) $8,000,000 as the correct aggregate.\n- But according to the reliable field \"invoice\", which says \"totaling $5,000,000.00\" (see the second row), it should match with $5,000,000, not $8,000,000.\n- Thus, the \"Fixed Assets\" row's amount should be $5,000,000, but is recorded as $8,000,000.\n\n### 2. Sale20240115045\n- ID: Sale20240115045\n- Invoice: \"On January 15, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 3.0 units at a unit price of $2,376.07, totaling $7,128.21.\"\n- Recorded: Date 2024-01-20, Amount 8,635.33, Quantity 3.0, Unit price 2,586.22, all of which contradict the invoice (which, as per instructions, is the reliable field).\n- Correct should be: Date 2024-01-15 (from invoice), Unit price 2,376.07, Amount 7,128.21.\n- All other fields (customer, tax, etc.) align.\n\n### Format\n- Each inconsistency is reported separately (as in the example).\n- For brevity, if only price/amount/date are wrong, other fields are left as null.\n\n**Therefore, only these two concrete inconsistencies are found in the provided data according to the reliable \"invoice\" fields.**",
