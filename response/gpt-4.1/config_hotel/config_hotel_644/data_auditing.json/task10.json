Initial20231231001 (Fixed Assets, amount inconsistency)\n\n- There are 3 entries for id `Initial20231231001`: Cash deposit ($3,000,000.00), Bank deposit ($5,000,000.00), Fixed Assets ($8,000,000.00).\n- The invoice for Fixed Assets on this date is $5,000,000.00 in the risk_issues column in the example, but in the provided record, Fixed Assets has $8,000,000.00.\n- This is an internal inconsistency, as the Fixed Assets value does not equal the sum of cash and bank, nor does it fit earlier example's $5,000,000.00 Fixed Assets value for this id.\n- Correct value should be $5,000,000.00 (as per risk_issues from the standard solution/example).\n\n### 2. Sale20240109025 (profit inconsistency)\n\n- The invoice text says: ... consisting of 3.0 units at a unit price of $569.84, totaling $1709.52. The cost amount ... $1050.00 ... profit should be $1709.52 - $1050.00 = $659.52 ...\n- However, in the row, `recorded_profit` is 684.7. That's: $1709.52 - $1024.82 = $684.7, so cost might be mismatched internally (but `recorded_cost_amount` is $1050.00).\n- Therefore, it appears that the profit should be $659.52 (as calculated from amount minus cost), but the system recorded $684.7.\n- Thus, the error is in the `recorded_profit` field.\n\n---\n\nIf you require more detected inconsistencies, let me know!",
