For a consistent record per id, the original (correct) \"category\" (recorded_type) should be \"Fixed Assets\".\n\nNote: If more specific field values are desired, they can be set, but given the lack of more context per the sample, only \"category\" was sufficiently clear as inconsistent. If more (e.g., amounts) are desired, add three separate solutions, one for each partial line, or merge as above. This solution focuses on the third row, the aggregate, as the correct one under the id.",
