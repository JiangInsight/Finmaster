Here, there are three rows with the same transaction ID, with different types (\"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\") and different \"amount\" values (3M, 5M, 8M). \n\n**The invoice field for each row does match the type/amount in the same row, indicating those are originally correct.**  \nHowever, having the same transaction ID for three different financial events (with different types & values) is a significant internal inconsistency. Most likely, one of the amounts/types is incorrect, or a copy-paste/ID assignment mistake occurred.\n\nLooking at the amounts:\n- 3mil (Cash deposit)\n- 5mil (Bank deposit)\n- 8mil (Fixed Assets)\n\nNotice: 3M+5M=8M, indicating the Fixed Assets entry is meant to represent the sum of the two deposits. This matches the common scenario where initial capital (cash+bank) is transferred into fixed assets.\n\nTherefore, **the likely intent is:**\n- Initial cash deposit: 3,000,000\n- Initial bank deposit: 5,000,000\n- Initial fixed assets acquisition: 8,000,000\n\nBecause the IDs are the same in all three, the error is in the transaction id assignment: on a standard dataset, these should be separate transaction IDs (or part of a composed transaction with child lines), but the amounts and the invoice texts in each row are internally consistent **(no field in the row is inconsistent compared to the row's invoice statement)**.\n\nSo, per the instructions: **If there's an inconsistency within a row's field recorded values compared to its invoice, that's the error to highlight.** If not, and the only error is the same ID across different types/amounts but each row is internally consistent, you would not change (\"Recorded\") the \"amount\", \"type\", etc. for these.\n\nSince the row for \"Fixed Assets\" has an amount of 8,000,000.00, which matches the invoice for \"Fixed Assets\", there is actually **no field-level error within this row**. The confusion is primarily in transaction ID assignment, which is not requested as a field to be fixed in the result format unless otherwise apparent.\n\nThus, the solution, following your requested format, is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Fixed Assets\", \"Recorded category\": \"Fixed Assets\", \"Original date\": \"2023-12-31\", \"Recorded date\": \"2023-12-31\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"8000000.0\", \"Recorded amount\": \"8000000.0\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Initial20231231001\"} }\n```\n\nIf you want to highlight the mistake of having duplicate IDs for logically independent entries (not within-field errors), please let me know! Otherwise, **per your instructions, the above is the correct row-based inconsistency report (i.e., no internal row data is inconsistent for that entry compared to its invoice).**",
