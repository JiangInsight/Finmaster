Normally, transaction id should not be shared for fundamentally different activities, or it should be reflected as one row if a single composite event.\n\n2. **Interest Receivables Payment Status:**\n   - For `Interest20240121021`, `Interest20240122022`, the invoice says \"unpaid\", but the recorded status is \"Paid\". The more reliable source (invoice) says \"Unpaid\"â€”so, the most likely correct value is \"Unpaid\".\n\n**If you would like every detected inconsistency from the whole table, each should be output in this format as above.
