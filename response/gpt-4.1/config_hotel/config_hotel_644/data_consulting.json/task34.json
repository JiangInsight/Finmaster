Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n= Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities  \n= -1,919,526.63 / 5,637,910.70  \n= **-0.34**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n= Total Liabilities / Total Equity  \nTotal Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (as no long-term liabilities are reported) = 5,637,910.70  \nTotal Owner's Equity = 16,099,532.29  \n= 5,637,910.70 / 16,099,532.29  \n= **0.35**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n= Total Revenue / Average Total Assets  \nTotal Revenue = 836,813.79  \nAverage Total Assets = (16,000,000 + 21,737,442.99) / 2 = 18,868,721.495  \n= 836,813.79 / 18,868,721.495  \n≈ **0.04**\n\n---\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\n= (Cash + Bank Deposits + Receivables) / Current Liabilities  \n= (2,105,753.37 + 559,055.66 + 6,494.02 + 335,639.38) / 5,637,910.70  \n= (2,105,753.37 + 559,055.66 + 6,494.02 + 335,639.38) = 3,006,942.43  \n= 3,006,942.43 / 5,637,910.70  \n≈ **0.53**\n\nHowever, in the examples, only cash, bank, and receivables (excluding interest receivable) may be used:\n\n= (2,105,753.37 + 559,055.66 + 335,639.38) / 5,637,910.70  \n= 3,000,448.41 / 5,637,910.70  \n≈ **0.53**\n\nBut the previous answer used a slightly more conservative approach (usually interest receivable is not considered for quick).\n\n**Let's stick with 0.53 for Quick Ratio.**\n\n---\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis is the same as \"Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\".\n\n= **-0.34**\n\n---\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n= Net Profit / Average Equity  \n= 99,532.29 / ((16,000,000 + 16,099,532.29) / 2)  \n= 99,532.29 / 16,049,766.145  \n= 0.0062 = **0.62%**\n\n---\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n= Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n\nAccounts Receivable at 2023-12-31 = 0  \nAccounts Receivable at 2024-02-01 = 335,639.38  \nAverage = (0 + 335,639.38) / 2 = 167,819.69  \nTurnover = 836,813.79 / 167,819.69 ≈ **4.99**\n\n---\n\n**Correction:**  \nThe previously provided answer used 2.49 and in the last example, it summed up AR change over the period, but usually, it's calculated as Revenue / Average AR.\n\nSo **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 4.99**\n\n---\n\n### Final JSON\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.34\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.35\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.04\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.53\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.34\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"0.62%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"4.99\"\n}}\n```\n**Note:** If you want only two decimals for the ratios, you may round accordingly.",
