Debt to Asset Ratio\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\n- From the balance sheet at the end date (2024-02-01):\n  - Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70  (no non-current liabilities given)\n  - Total Assets = 21,737,442.99\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 5,637,910.70 / 21,737,442.99 ≈ 0.2593 → Rounded to 0.26\n\n#### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,919,526.63 \n- Net Profit = 99,532.29\n\nRatio = (-1,919,526.63) / 99,532.29 ≈ -19.29\n\nBut the ratio is typically presented as an absolute value or if negative, potentially kept as is (as in prior examples, negative values may be valid and seen as a warning sign).\n\n#### 3. Formatting\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: \"0.26\"\n- Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: \"19.29\" (magnitude, per prior pattern, not showing negative sign)\n",
