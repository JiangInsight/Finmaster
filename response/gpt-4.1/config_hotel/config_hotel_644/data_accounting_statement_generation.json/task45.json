                        "content": "Let's work step by step.\n\n## 1. Cash Flow from Investing Activities: Definition\nCash flows from investing activities usually include:\n- Outflows for purchase of long-term assets (like fixed assets/equipment/renovation/etc.)\n- Inflows from sale of long-term assets (not present here)\n- Acquisitions of other entities (not present here)\n- Loans made or repayments collected (not present here; \"interest receivable\" is operating/finance, not investing inflow)\n\n**Here, focusing on purchases of fixed/long-term assets:**\n\n## 2. Identify Fixed Asset Purchases in the Data\n\nLet's parse and sum all lines of type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or initial Fixed Assets, as in the example.\n\n### (a) Initial Fixed Assets\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | ... | 8000000.0 | ... \n- But in cash flow, \"initial balance\" is not a cash transaction in the period; it's an opening balance, not an investing activity in the reporting period.\n**We IGNORE initial balances (\"Initial20231231001\")** for the cash flow statement, as in your example.\n\n### (b) FixedAsset20231231001\n1. | FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 455144.64 | ...\n2. | FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 374964.45 | ...\n3. | FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 1495645.8 | ...\n4. | FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 625338.59 | ...\n5. | FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 464570.86 | ...\n\n*Note: Each row has a different amount and asset name. These are separate purchases, not duplicates.*\n\n- 455,144.64 (Elevator System4)\n- 374,964.45 (Kitchen Equipment5)\n- 1,495,645.80 (Renovation Project6)\n- 625,338.59 (Elevator System7)\n- 464,570.86 (Kitchen Equipment8)\n\n### (c) Are there any inflows?\nNo sales/disposals of long-term assets appear. All are outflows.\n\n## 3. Summing Up\nSum all \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" lines (correspond to outflows; values are positive in data but are cash outflows, so the net is negative).\n\n- 455,144.64\n- 374,964.45\n- 1,495,645.80\n- 625,338.59\n- 464,570.86\n\nLet's calculate the total:\n\n#### Manual calculation:\n455,144.64  \n+ 374,964.45 → 830,109.09  \n+ 1,495,645.80 → 2,325,754.89  \n+ 625,338.59 → 2,951,093.48  \n+ 464,570.86 → **3,415,664.34**\n\n## 4. Direction\n\nCash paid to acquire fixed assets is an outflow, so we report it as negative.\n\n## 5. Formatting (as in your examples)\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-3415664.34\"} }\n```\n\n## 6. Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-3415664.34\"} }\n```",
