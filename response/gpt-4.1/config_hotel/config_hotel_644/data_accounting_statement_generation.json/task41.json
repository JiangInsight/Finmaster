There is NO opening balance for payables in explicit data, so we take opening AP as 0 or check initial entries for any payables (none).\n- All purchases marked as \"Unpaid\" and with \"Account Payable\" or similar method on 2023-12-31 are considered end-of-period AP.\n- Ending AP will be the sum of all \"Unpaid\" purchases and purchases marked as \"Account Payable\" as of 2023-12-31.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Purchases on Credit (i.e., on Account Payable)**\n\nLetâ€™s pick all \"Purchase\" entries with \"Unpaid\" and also payment_method \"Account Payable\". Some may be pre-marked with \"Unpaid\" only.\nLet's add up all these \"Unpaid\" purchase entries as of 2023-12-31:\n\nFrom the data:\n\n| id                 | type      | amount   | payment/receipt_status | payment_method     | supplier  | product      |\n|--------------------|-----------|----------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------|------------|\n| Purchase20231231001| Purchase  | 809280.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable    | S002      | Banquet Set |\n| Purchase20231231002| Purchase  | 19650.0  | Unpaid                | Account Payable    | S010      | Quick Meal  |\n| Purchase20231231005| Purchase  | 44850.0  | Unpaid                | Account Payable    | S004      | Quick Meal  |\n| Purchase20231231006| Purchase  | 605000.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable    | S002      | Luxury Suite|\n| Purchase20231231007| Purchase  | 75250.0  | Unpaid                | Account Payable    | S002      | Business M. |\n| Purchase20231231012| Purchase  | 100800.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable    | S002      | Business M. |\n| Purchase20231231013| Purchase  | 596000.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable    | S002      | BusinessRoom|\n| Purchase20231231015| Purchase  | 1470000.0| Unpaid                | Account Payable    | S002      | Luxury Suite|\n| Purchase20231231016| Purchase  | 700000.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable    | S009      | Luxury Suite|\n| Purchase20231231017| Purchase  | 218240.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable    | S005      | Deluxe Meal |\n| Purchase20231231018| Purchase  | 399000.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable    | S009      | Standard Rm |\n| Purchase20231231020| Purchase  | 558000.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable    | S004      | BusinessRm  |\n\nAdd these all up:\n\n- 809,280.00\n- 19,650.00\n- 44,850.00\n- 605,000.00\n- 75,250.00\n- 100,800.00\n- 596,000.00\n- 1,470,000.00\n- 700,000.00\n- 218,240.00\n- 399,000.00\n- 558,000.00\n\nNow sum:\n\n809,280\n+ 19,650\n+ 44,850\n+ 605,000\n+ 75,250\n+ 100,800\n+ 596,000\n+ 1,470,000\n+ 700,000\n+ 218,240\n+ 399,000\n+ 558,000 =\n= 5,595,070.00\n\n**Step 3: Opening AP is Zero (since there are no previous year AP, only initial assets/cash/bank/fixed asset entries).**\n  - So Increase in Accounts Payable = Closing AP - Opening AP = 5,595,070.00 - 0 = **5,595,070.00**\n\n**Step 4: Present in Required JSON Format**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"5595070.00\"} }\n```\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"5595070.00\"} }\n```",
