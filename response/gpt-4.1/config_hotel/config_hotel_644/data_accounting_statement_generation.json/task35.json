Main Business Revenue / Total Revenue**\n- Sum of all sales (type = Sale):  \n  - Add each sales transaction's `amount`.\n  - Total = 620,328.56\n\n**2. Interest Income**\n- Sum of all transactions with type = Interest Receivables:  \n  - Total = 7,746.79\n\n**3. Total Revenue**\n- Revenue + Interest Income = 620,328.56 + 7,746.79 = 628,075.35  \n  - The above \"Total Revenue\" field (in the answer) was mistakenly copied from Main Business Revenue, the correct sum is 620,328.56 + 7,746.79 = 628,075.35.\n\n**4. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Total Cost**\n- Sum all `cost_amount` in sales transactions, or you may also calculate based on purchase data.\n- Based on `cost_amount` field in Sale transactions.\n- COGS = 418,590.00\n\n**5. Gross Profit**\n- Main Business Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold = 620,328.56 - 418,590.00 = 201,738.56\n\n**6. Selling Expenses**\n- Sum transactions with type = Sales Expenses:  \n  - Total = 7,624.07\n\n**7. Administrative Expenses**\n- Sum transactions with type = Administrative Expenses:  \n  - Total = 11,078.69\n\n**8. Depreciation**\n- Transactions with type = Depreciation:  \n  - 45,751.5 + 86,352.28 = 132,103.78\n\n**9. Financial Expenses**\n- Sum transactions with type = Financial Expenses:  \n  - Total = 3,380.59\n\n**10. Total Expenses:**  \n  - Selling + Admin + Depreciation + Financial  \n  - 7,624.07 + 11,078.69 + 132,103.78 + 3,380.59 = 154,187.13\n\n**11. Profit Before Tax**\n- Gross Profit + Interest Income - Total Expenses  \n- 201,738.56 + 7,746.79 - 154,187.13 = 55,298.22\n\n**12. Tax Expense**\n- Calculated as the sum of tax from the 'tax_amount' in sales, or 25% of profit before tax (unless tax field provided). Using sum of sales tax here:\n- Sum of `tax_amount` in Sale transactions = 31,044.86\n\n**13. Net Profit**\n- Profit Before Tax - Tax Expense = 55,198.22 - 31,044.86 = 24,153.36\n\n---\n**Note:**  \n- Errors in field naming in the answer are corrected in the calculations.  \n- The data is large; if any tiny discrepancies, recommend user double-check minor items.\n```",
