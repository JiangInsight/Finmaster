                        "content": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n## Step 1: What is Paid-in Capital?\n- Paid-in capital is the amount invested by shareholders/owners into the company (usually in the form of cash, bank deposits, fixed assets, etc.) at the time of company establishment or additional contributions. It does NOT change by daily operational activities (purchasing, sales, expenses, etc.).\n\n## Step 2: Identify Paid-in Capital in Data\n- Locate deposit-type records at company setup (marked with `Initial...`)\n- Only the records that contribute directly to owner equity at company setup are included: \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", and \"Fixed Assets\" under the `Initial...` id.\n\n### In the Table:\n| id                  | type          | date         | amount      |\n|---------------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Initial20231231001  | Cash deposit  | 2023-12-31   | 3,000,000.0 |\n| Initial20231231001  | Bank deposit  | 2023-12-31   | 5,000,000.0 |\n| Initial20231231001  | Fixed Assets  | 2023-12-31   | 8,000,000.0 |\n\n#### Add these amounts:\n- Cash deposit:      3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit:      5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets:      8,000,000.00\n\n**Total Paid-in Capital (initial):**  \n3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 8,000,000.00 = **16,000,000.00**\n\n## Step 3: Has Paid-in Capital Changed?\n- Review data for capital additions or withdrawals (none present in the sample, only business activity).\n- No evidence of capital increase/decrease, so the end value is the same as the initial value.\n\n## Step 4: Output in Required Format\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\", \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"16000000.00\"} }\n```\n",
