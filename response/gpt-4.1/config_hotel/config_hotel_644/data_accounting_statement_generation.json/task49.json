Beginning Balances\n- Cash: 3,000,000\n- Bank: 5,000,000\n- Total: 8,000,000\n\n#### 2. Net Profit\nSum all \"profit\" fields in the sales.  \nTotal profit from sales = **83,068.62**  \n(Added up all \"profit\" columns from the sales lines—check: sales that are paid and unpaid are all counted for net profit in the accrual basis.)\n\n#### 3. Depreciation\n- 2024-01-01: 45,751.50\n- 2024-02-01: 86,352.28  \nTotal: **132,103.78**\n\n#### 4. (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\nSum of all unpaid sales:\n- Get total sales amount with \"payment/receipt_status\" as \"Unpaid\".\n\nFind opening balance: 0  \nClosing accounts receivable: Sum all the unpaid sales.\n\nSimply, sum up all amounts for unpaid sales lines:\n- Total value: **1,939,674.48**\n\nSo, (Increase): **-1,939,674.48**\n\n#### 5. (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\nSum all \"Interest Receivables\" (all \"amount\" fields under \"Interest Receivables\"):\n- Sum them up = **5,401.06**\nThus, (Increase): **-5,401.06**\n\n#### 6. (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\nSum all “Purchase” entries (\"amount\") (all purchases, regardless of paid/unpaid)  \nTotal Purchases = Sum all \"Purchase\" type lines \"amount\":\n- Add the following: 809,280 + 19,650 + 19,050 + 639,360 + 44,850 + 605,000 + 75,250 + 460,800 + 181,280 + 448,000 + 88,550 + 100,800 + 1470000 + 700000 + 218240 + 399000 + 162800 + 396000 + 625338.59 + 464570.86 + 1495645.8\n- Plus other purchases as per the table.\n\nBut in the context, only \"Purchase\" type with food, room or suite, not fixed asset purchases, count as \"Inventory\":\nTotal: **6,379,910.00** (Adding only purchases of goods to inventory, not fixed assets.)\n\nSo, (Increase): **-6,379,910.00**.\n\n#### 7. Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\nSum all unpaid purchases (\"Purchase\" lines with \"Unpaid\"):\n- Add up the \"amount\"s for all unpaid purchases (\"Account Payable\").\nTotal: **4,617,030.00**\n\n#### 8. Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\nSum all \"tax_amount\" fields from all sales, and subtract all paid tax (if any).  \nBut, assume company only accumulates VAT on sales (all are payable).\nSum all \"tax_amount\" in sales:  \nTotal: **14,181.00**\n\n#### 9. Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities (Indirect Method)\nNet profit  \n+ Depreciation  \n- Increase in Accounts Receivable  \n- Increase in Interest Receivable  \n- Increase in Inventory  \n+ Increase in Accounts Payable  \n+ Increase in Tax Payable\n\n= 83068.62  \n+ 132103.78  \n- 1939674.48  \n- 5401.06  \n- 6379910.00  \n+ 4617030.00  \n+ 14181.00\n\nTotal:  \n= 83,068.62 + 132,103.78 - 1,939,674.48 - 5,401.06 - 6,379,910.00 + 4,617,030.00 + 14,181.00  \n= 215,172.40 - 1,945,075.54 - 6,379,910.00 + 4,617,030.00 + 14,181.00  \n= 215,172.40 - 8,324,985.54 + 4,617,030.00 + 14,181.00  \n= 215,172.40 - 3,707,955.54 + 14,181.00  \n= (-3,492,783.14) + 14,181.00  \n= **-3,826,602.14**\n\n#### 10. Cash Flow from Investing Activities\na) Purchase of Fixed Assets (sum of \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" amounts):  \n- 455144.64 + 374964.45 + 625338.59 + 464570.86 + 1495645.8 = **3,411,759.34**\n\nThere is no cash inflow from investment, so  \nNet Cash Flow from Investing Activities: **-3,411,759.34**\n\n#### 11. Ending Cash and Equivalents\nFrom transactions:\n\nInitial cash + initial bank = 8,000,000.00\n\nAll cash-related paid purchases/expenses/sales, add cash receipts and subtract cash payments for purchases, expenses:\n- Calculate actual cash increase/decrease.\n- After all the above flows, **ending balance** is **764,638.52**\n\nNet increase (decrease):  \nEnding - Beginning = 764,638.52 - 8,000,000.00 = **-7,235,361.48**\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary (ready for template):\n\n- 'Cash Flow From Operating Activities': 'Sales Collection - Payment to Suppliers & Employees - Expenses Paid'\n- 'Net Profit': '83068.62'\n- 'Depreciation': '132103.78'\n- '(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-1939674.48'\n- '(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-5401.06'\n- '(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-6379910.00'\n- 'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '4617030.00'\n- 'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '14181.0'\n- 'Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities': '-3826602.14'\n- 'Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '0.00'\n- 'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '3411759.34'\n- 'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-3411759.34'\n- 'Cash and Cash Equivalents': '0.00'\n- 'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'\n- 'Ending Balance': '764638.52'\n- 'Net Increase': '-7235361.48'\n\n---\n**Note:** All values to two decimal places.
