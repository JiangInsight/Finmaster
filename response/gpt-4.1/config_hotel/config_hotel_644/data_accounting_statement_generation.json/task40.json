(Increase) Decrease in Inventory (for Cash Flow Statement)\n\nCash Flow Statement reflects the change as:  \n(Current Inventory - Prior Inventory)\n- If inventory INCREASED: (negative impact on cash)\n- If inventory DECREASED: (positive)\n\nSo:  \n7,454,550 (Closing) - 7,992,910 (Opening) = **-538,360**\n\n- Negative result = Increase in inventory (*but here*, since our inventory decreased, the amount is negative, which for the cash flow is correctly shown as a decrease).\n\nBut, per financial statement, \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" — since inventory decreased, this is a positive cash flow:\n\nSo, present as:\n\n{'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '538,360.00'}\n\n### 5. Final Solution\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"538360.00\"} }\n```\n\nThis means that inventory **decreased by 538,360**, so the amount positively contributed to operating cash flows.",
