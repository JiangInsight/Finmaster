Initial Balances:**\n\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00 (Cash or Equivalent)\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.00 -- but that's not cash, unless it's a purchase paid for by cash/bank. But this line is just initial asset balances, not a cash flow.\n\nSo, the starting cash AND bank is:  \n**Initial cash and cash equivalents: 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### **B. Cash Inflows**\n- **Sales marked Paid AND receive_method is 'Cash' (or presumably cash equivalents):**\n\nFind all sales matching:\n- payment/receipt_status: 'Paid'\n\nFrom pattern:  \nLet’s identify all sales (type == Sale) with 'Paid' and receive_method is 'Cash'.\n\nLet's extract all such transactions and sum the receipts.\n\n#### **B.1.
