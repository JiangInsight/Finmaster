Definition\n\n**Accumulated Depreciation** is a contra-asset account on the balance sheet representing the total depreciation expense that has been recorded against fixed assets since those assets were acquired.\n\n## 2. Determining Initial Value\n\nLook for all lines with type \"Initial...\" or reflection of opening balances for Accumulated Depreciation.  \nFrom the data:\n\n- | Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit ... |\n- | Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit ... |\n- | Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets ... | â†’ 8,000,000.00\n\nBut **no Accumulated Depreciation** initial value is recorded; initial depreciation is typically zero unless specified otherwise.\n\n**So:**  \nAccumulated Depreciation Initial Value = 0.00\n\n## 3. Find Depreciation Transactions\n\nLook for all lines with type \"Depreciation\".\n\nFrom data:\n- | Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | ... | 45751.5 | ... |\n- | Depreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | 2024-02-01 | ... | 86352.28 | ... |\n\nSo for January:\n- On 2024-01-01: +45,751.50\n- On 2024-02-01: +86,352.28\n\nJanuary closing means, up to Jan 31, only the **first** depreciation has been recorded for January. The Feb depreciation is not part of January close, so we don't count it.\n\n## 4. Summing for End Value\n\nTo get Accumulated Depreciation at the end of January (post Jan 31, 2024), sum up all depreciation entries posted on/before Jan 31.\n\n- Only **one** depreciation for Jan = **45,751.50**\n- The next depreciation is on Feb 1st and does **not** belong to January.\n\n## 5. Format Solution\n\nAll values should be in two-decimal format.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"45751.50\"} }\n```",
