                        "content": "Let's break down the steps to calculate the **Net Cash Flows from Investing Activities** for the given data.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Investing Activities\n\nAccording to cash flow statement classifications, investing activities typically include:\n- **Cash paid to acquire fixed assets, intangible assets, and other long-term assets**\n- **Cash received from the disposal of fixed assets, intangible assets, and other long-term assets**\n\nIn practical terms:  \n**Outflow:** Purchases of fixed assets (e.g., machinery, equipment, buildings)  \n**Inflow:** Sales/disposal of fixed assets\n\n**Purchases of inventory or goods (for sale)**, operating expenses, etc., are operating activities and do not count here.\n\n### Step 2: Find Transactions Related to Investing Activities\n\nWe need to look for transactions identifiable as fixed asset acquisitions/disposals. In the provided data, look for:\n- `type` or `id` like \"Fixed Assets\", \"Fixed Asset Purchase\", or description mentioning `(asset_type)`\n\n#### On Inspection\n\nLet's look in detail:\n\n- **Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | amount 8,000,000.0**\n    - This is part of the opening balance / initial set up, NOT a cash flow activity of this period.\n- **FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | amount 830,405.75 | Paid | Bank Transfer**\n    - Actual cash outflow in the period, for fixed assets!\n    - *Asset_name*: Central AC4\n- **FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | amount 383,011.45 | Paid | Bank Transfer**\n    - For asset Kitchen Equipment5\n\nAll other purchases are inventory or for trading, which are **not** investing activities.\n\n#### There are NO fixed asset disposals or other inflows from investing activities.\n\n### Step 3: Add Up the Outflows\n\nInvesting activity cash flows = **Sum of cash paid for purchasing fixed assets in the period**\n\n- Central AC4:      830,405.75\n- Kitchen Equipment5: 383,011.45\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n\nNet = Total inflows (0) - Outflows (830,405.75 + 383,011.45)\n\nNet Cash Flow = **– 1,213,417.20**\n\n### Step 5: Present in Required JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-1213417.20\"} }\n```\n\n**Summary reasoning:**  \nOnly cash paid for fixed asset (long-term asset) acquisitions is counted. Two such actual, paid transactions appear in the period—a purchase of central AC and kitchen equipment, totaling 1,213,417.20 outflow. No inflow from asset sales. Opening balances do not affect cash flow for the period.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-1213417.20\"} }\n```",
