(In this case, there is no explicit transfer in.)\n\n#### **Bank Decreases (Payments from bank deposit):**\n\nFind all \"Paid\" purchases/assets with \"Bank Transfer\" as payment method:\n\n1. **2023-12-31: Purchase (Purchase20231231014)**\n   - Amount: 34,500.0\n\n2. **2023-12-31: Fixed Assets Purchase (FixedAsset20231231001)**\n   - Central AC4: 830,405.75\n\n3. **2023-12-31: Fixed Assets Purchase (FixedAsset20231231001)**\n   - Kitchen Equipment5: 383,011.45\n\n**Total Bank Decreases:**  \n34,500.0 + 830,405.75 + 383,011.45 = **1,247,917.20**\n\n#### **Bank Increases**\n\nThere are no cash to bank transfer (\"Cash to bank transfer\") records in this problem, nor any other explicit income to the bank account.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Final Bank Deposit**\n\nInitial Bank Deposit: 5,000,000.00  \nMinus total payments from bank: 1,247,917.20  \nBank Deposits End Value = 5,000,000.00 - 1,247,917.20 = **3,752,082.80**\n\nHowever, let's double-check if any bank receipts (money into the bank deposit) could be hidden in \"Sale\" or other transaction types.\n\n- All sales list payment method as \"Cash\" or are \"Unpaid\". None indicate direct bank deposit.\n- No explicit other receipts to bank.\n\n### Step 3: Confirm No Overlooked Bank-In or Bank-Out\n\n- Only purchases, asset purchases with \"Paid | Bank Transfer\", and the initial value affect the bank deposit.\n- No \"Bank Transfer\" incoming (unless a transfer from another account is specified, which is not present).\n- All other expense payments are via \"Cash\".\n\n### Step 4: Final Tally\n\n- **Bank Deposits Initial Value:** 5,000,000.00\n- **Minus:** Fixed Asset purchases and purchases paid by Bank Transfer: 1,247,917.20\n- **Bank Deposits End Value:** 3,752,082.80\n\n**But let's check again if there might be any more purchases on 2023-12-31 paid by \"Bank Transfer\":**\nRe-examining data...\n\n- Purchase20231231014 | 34,500.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | 830,405.75 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | 383,011.45 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n\nThese are the only ones with \"Paid\" and \"Bank Transfer\".\n\n**No other \"Paid\" purchases indicate Bank Transfer.**\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"3752082.80\"}}\n```",
