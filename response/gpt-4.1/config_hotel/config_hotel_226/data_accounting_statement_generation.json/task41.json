Find Purchases Paid (Decrease in Accounts Payable)\n\nInclude only **Purchase** entries with **Paid** *and* payment method **Account Payable** or similar (i.e., a reduction in AP).  \nBut from the data above, all Paid purchases are paid with Cash or Bank Transfer -- not via using down Account Payable balances (i.e., not settling previous AP).  \nSo, **No purchases with \"Paid\" and payment via \"Account Payable\" are found.**\n\nSometimes, a company can pay an old AP but the transactions here don't show AP settlements; all paid purchases are paid at the time of purchase (on the spot).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Beginning and Ending Accounts Payable\n\nIs there an *opening* AP balance at 2023-12-31?\nNo Accounts Payable balance is provided under \"Initial\", so assumed zero opening AP.\n\n**Ending accounts payable at period end** is the sum of all unpaid purchases as of end of the period.\n\n- All these unpaid \"Account Payable\" purchases are dated 2023-12-31 (beginning of Jan), meaning this is the *beginning* AP balance for January 2024.\n- If any purchases were made in January or later and left unpaid, they would increase ending AP. However, all other purchases in January are paid upon purchase.\n\nSo:\n- **Opening AP (2023-12-31): 7,566,370.0**  \n- **No changes in payables during January since all Jan purchases are paid.**  \n- **No payments settling old payables are shown.**\n- *Therefore*, **Ending AP remains 7,566,370.0.**\n\nThus, the **increase in AP over the period is 7,566,370.0 - 0 = 7,566,370.0**.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Final Output\n\nThe increase (decrease) in Accounts Payable during the period is **7,566,370.00**.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"7,566,370.00\"} }\n```",
