Only actual direct purchases (not depreciation or opening balances) are included.\n\n2. **Identify Fixed Asset Purchase rows:**\n   - Search for transaction(s) directly describing fixed assets acquisitions.\n   - In this data, look for type = **Fixed Assets Purchase** or similar, or an obvious purchase of a fixed asset with a clear asset name/asset_type.\n\n3. **Relevant Row(s) (scanning table):**\n   - | FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 830405.75 | 830405.75 | ... | Paid | Bank Transfer | ... | Kitchen Equipment5 | Kitchen Equipment |\n   - | FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 383011.45 | 383011.45 | ... | Paid | Bank Transfer | ... | Kitchen Equipment5 | Kitchen Equipment |\n   \n   (There are two entries with the same ID \"FixedAsset20231231001\" but with different amounts. Possibly these are two separate assets, or the data structure is duplicated but with distinct amounts/assets listed.)\n\n4. **Sum direct fixed asset purchases:**\n   - 830,405.75 (Central AC4)\n   - 383,011.45 (Kitchen Equipment5)\n\n   Total: **830,405.75 + 383,011.45 = 1,213,417.20**\n\n5. **Double-check for other fixed asset purchases:**\n   - No other \"type\" matches \"Fixed Assets Purchase\". All \"Purchase\" types refer to inventory or consumable items (like Banquet Set, Quick Meal Set, etc.), identified by their product names/types.\n   - \"Initial\" type with Fixed Assets is just the opening balance/start of period -- *not* a cash flow.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Only the above two items are considered outflows for \"purchase of fixed assets\" in the cash flow statement.\n\n**Final answer:**  \nTotal cash flow for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = **1,213,417.20**",
