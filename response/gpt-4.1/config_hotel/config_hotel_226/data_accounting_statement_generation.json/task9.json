The purchases labeled 2023-12-31 are likely included in the 8,000,000.00.\n\n   - Q: Are there any *new* fixed asset acquisitions after the initial period?  \n     - None after 2023-12-31.\n\n3. **Deduct Depreciation:**  \n   Identify all depreciation entries:\n   - Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | ... | 45745.8 | ...\n   - Depreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | 2024-02-01 | ... | 69766.11 | ...\n\n   So, **Total Depreciation = 45745.80 + 69766.11 = 115511.91**\n\n4. **Calculate Closing (End) Fixed Assets Net:**\n\n   Let:\n   - **Start**: 8,000,000.00  \n   - **Add**: (Any new fixed asset purchases after 2023-12-31, in this case none) = 0.00  \n   - **Subtract**: Depreciation 115,511.91\n\n   Preliminary **End Value**:  \n   8,000,000.00 - 115,511.91 = 7,884,488.09\n\n   However, note:  \n   The asset purchases for 830,405.75 and 383,011.45, both on 2023-12-31, may not be included in the 8,000,000.00 (depends on whether initial figure includes them or not). Let's double-check.\n\n   - It's *likely* the 8,000,000.00 is a PRELIMINARY opening, and additional purchases on the last day are *not* yet included.  \n   - Sum the total of these:\n     - 830,405.75 (Central AC4)\n     - 383,011.45 (Kitchen Equipment5)\n     - **Total New Purchases to ADD:** 1,213,417.20\n\n   **New End Value Calculation:**\n\n   - Start: 8,000,000.00  \n   - Add: 1,213,417.20  \n   - Subtract: 115,511.91\n\n   **End Value:**  \n   8,000,000.00 + 1,213,417.20 - 115,511.91 = **9,097,905.29**\n\n   But in the **example** provided in your sample, all asset purchases dated 2023-12-31 are INCLUDED in the initial value already.\n\n   - So, asset purchases dated 2023-12-31 are already in opening balance (8,000,000.00).\n   - Thus, only depreciation needs to be deducted.\n\n   **Final Calculation:**\n   - **Initial Value:** 8,000,000.00\n   - **Less Depreciation:** 115,511.91\n   - **End Value:** 7,884,488.09\n\n   But none of the lines after 2023-12-31 with type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\". So, only the depreciation affects the end value.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"fixed assets net Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"fixed assets net End Value\": \"7884488.09\"}}\n```",
