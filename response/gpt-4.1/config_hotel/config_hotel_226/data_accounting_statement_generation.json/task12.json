What is \"Accounts Payable\"?\nAccounts payable is a liability account representing amounts owed to suppliers for purchases made on credit, i.e., purchases where the payment is not yet made at period end.\n\n## 2. Initial Value (\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\")\nLook at all the \"Initial...\" rows for a starting value. In this table:\n\n| id                  | type           | amount     |\n|---------------------|----------------|------------|\n| Initial20231231001  | Cash deposit   | 3,000,000  |\n| Initial20231231001  | Bank deposit   | 5,000,000  |\n| Initial20231231001  | Fixed Assets   | 8,000,000  |\n\nNone mention \"Accounts Payable\".\nSo Accounts Payable Initial Value is **0.00**.\n\n## 3. Purchases On Credit (Unpaid, Account Payable)\nSum any \"Purchase\" with **Unpaid** status and **Account Payable** payment method at/before period end.\n\nList the relevant entries:\n\n| id                  | type      | date        | amount   | payment/receipt_status | payment_method     |\n|---------------------|-----------|-------------|----------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n| Purchase20231231002 | Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 696,960  | Unpaid                | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231003 | Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 394,560  | Unpaid                | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231004 | Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 286,000  | Unpaid                | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231008 | Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 544,000  | Unpaid                | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231009 | Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 43,400   | Unpaid                | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231011 | Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 163,500  | Unpaid                | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231012 | Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 235,500  | Unpaid                | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231013 | Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 466,560  | Unpaid                | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231015 | Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 800,000  | Unpaid                | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231016 | Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 685,000  | Unpaid                | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231017 | Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 78,400   | Unpaid                | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231018 | Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 64,750   | Unpaid                | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231019 | Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 1,075,000| Unpaid                | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231020 | Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 236,720  | Unpaid                | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231021 | Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 1,115,000| Unpaid                | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231022 | Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 88,880   | Unpaid                | Account Payable    |\n| Purchase20231231025 | Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 570,240  | Unpaid                | Account Payable    |\n\n### Add up:\n\n- 696,960\n- 394,560\n- 286,000\n- 544,000\n- 43,400\n- 163,500\n- 235,500\n- 466,560\n- 800,000\n- 685,000\n- 78,400\n- 64,750\n- 1,075,000\n- 236,720\n- 1,115,000\n- 88,880\n- 570,240\n\nLet's total:\n\n- 696,960 + 394,560 = 1,091,520\n- + 286,000 = 1,377,520\n- + 544,000 = 1,921,520\n- + 43,400 = 1,964,920\n- + 163,500 = 2,128,420\n- + 235,500 = 2,363,920\n- + 466,560 = 2,830,480\n- + 800,000 = 3,630,480\n- + 685,000 = 4,315,480\n- + 78,400 = 4,393,880\n- + 64,750 = 4,458,630\n- + 1,075,000 = 5,533,630\n- + 236,720 = 5,770,350\n- + 1,115,000 = 6,885,350\n- + 88,880 = 6,974,230\n- + 570,240 = **7,544,470**\n\nThe **sum of all unpaid purchases = 7,544,470**.\n\n## 4. Paid Purchases\nPurchases marked as Paid do not contribute to accounts payable.\n\n## 5. Any payments against AP in the period?\nReview the table for any \"Payment\" against suppliers that would decrease AP. But all purchases marked \"Unpaid\" above remain unpaid; there is no explicit payment against AP (no actual \"payment of AP\" transactions in the sample as in, e.g., a 'Purchase Payment' or similar transaction). All \"Paid\" purchases are paid at time of purchase; \"Unpaid\" are not subsequently paid.\n\n## 6. End Value (\"Accounts Payable End Value\")\nIt is the sum of all unpaid purchases at period end, since no payments occurred.\n\n## 7. Present Solution As Required\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"7544470.00\"} }\n```\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"7544470.00\"} }\n```",
