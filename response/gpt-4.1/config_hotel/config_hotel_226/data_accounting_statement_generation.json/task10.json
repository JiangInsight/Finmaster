Checking the data:\n     - The initial value is as of 2023-12-31.\n     - The fixed asset purchases are also dated 2023-12-31, **but** they are in addition to the initial - implying that after 2023-12-31 opening balances are stated, there were asset purchases (just like in the example prompt).\n     - Therefore, we add them.\n\n---\n\n4. **Final Calculation (Double-check):**\n\n   - Opening:                8,000,000.00\n   - + Central AC:             830,405.75\n   - + Kitchen Equipment:      383,011.45\n   - - Depreciation Jan:       45,745.8\n   - - Depreciation Feb:       69,766.11\n\n   - Calculation:\n     - 8,000,000.00 + 830,405.75 + 383,011.45 = 9,213,417.20\n     - 9,213,417.20 - 45,745.8 - 69,766.11 = **9,097,905.29**\n   \n---\n\n**Result**:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"9097905.29\"}}\n```\n(Note: if you want to adapt the end-of-month cutoff, say for end of January only, only the first depreciation is deducted.) \n\nBut according to data, up to 2024-02-01, the above is correct.",
