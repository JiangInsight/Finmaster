Receipts from customers (**cash sales**)\n- **Operating Outflows:** Cash paid to suppliers (**inventory purchases, for goods sold**), and **cash paid for operating expenses** (Sales, Administrative, Financial)\n- **Exclude:** Depreciation (non-cash), Fixed assets purchases (Investing outflows), interest receivables (only include if received in cash).\n\n**Step 2: Extract Cash Sales (Operating Cash Inflows)**\nFind all Sale records with `payment/receipt_status` as `Paid` and sum their amounts.\n\n**Step 3: Extract Cash Purchases (Operating Outflows)**\nFind Purchases with `payment/receipt_status` as Paid and sum their amounts.\n\n**Step 4: Cash Paid for Operating Expenses**\nInclude all \"Expense\" records with Paid status and sum for Administrative, Sales, Financial

from paid operating expenses: 25,449.81  \n\nNet result: significant negative cash flow from operating activities (more spent on purchases than received on sales and expenses).  \n*(Note: If you have any different interpretations or see paid status discrepancies in the data, adjust accordingly, but the calculation approach stands.)*",
