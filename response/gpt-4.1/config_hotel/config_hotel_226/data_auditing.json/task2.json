The recorded_amount is inconsistent with the standardized invoice field, which is generally more reliable.\n- Therefore, the \"Recorded amount\" is $8,000,000.00, but the best estimate for \"Original amount\" based on the invoice is $5,000,000.00. All other fields in this row are null or consistent.\n- The other duplicate IDs (`Initial20231231001` for Cash deposit and Bank deposit) match the invoice amount, so they are not flagged.\n- No other inconsistencies are found within the sample provided beyond the above.\n\nIf you wish to scan for all other rows and multiple fields in a full massive dataset, please say so!",
