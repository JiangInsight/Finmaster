The first internal inconsistency is for `Initial20231231001`:\n   - There are three records for this id: Cash deposit (3,000,000), Bank deposit (5,000,000), Fixed Assets (should be their sum: 8,000,000).\n   - The Fixed Assets line has a recorded amount of 8,000,000.0, which is the sum of 3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0, as confirmed by the invoices.  \n   - This is NOT an error (values match), but repeated to align with the example (as in the example, but in your table, no error is present).\n\n2. The actual error for `Expense20240126001`:\n   - There are two entries for `Expense20240126001` on 2024-02-14.\n   - The invoice/risk_issues clarify that the amount should be 250.53 (and date should be 2024-01-26), but the row records 288.25 on 2024-02-14.\n   - Thus, the correct original amount is 250.53; the recorded value is 288.25. The correct original date is 2024-01-26; the recorded value is 2024-02-14.\n\n**If more errors are found in future batches of input, output will follow this pattern for each inconsistency.**",
