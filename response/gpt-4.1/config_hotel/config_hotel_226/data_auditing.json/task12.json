But the total should add up; usually, the sum of cash and bank equals fixed assets if this is a startup capital allocation. Here: 3M + 5M = 8M, so this is NOT an error, just a multi-row summary.\n\n2. **Purchase20231231001** — All fields match invoice calculation. No inconsistency.\n\n3. **Purchase20231231005** — The invoice text says \"The approver is Director\", but the actual \"recorded_approver\" field is blank. The correct value should be \"Director\".\n\nAll other entries match between invoice and row data. Only Purchase20231231005 shows an actual inconsistency. The output includes the required format, listing only real inconsistencies found. If more errors existed, they'd also be listed in this format.",
