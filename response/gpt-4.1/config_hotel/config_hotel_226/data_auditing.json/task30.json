Initial20231231001 multi-line entries (Initial deposit inconsistency)\n\n- There are 3 entries for `Initial20231231001`: \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\".\n- The amounts are 3000000 (cash), 5000000 (bank), and 8000000 (fixed assets).\n- The total of cash+bank = 8,000,000. This matches normal double-entry accounting: initial investment deposited to cash and bank, offset by credit to fixed assets (capital).\n- However, the **Fixed Assets** line should record 8,000,000 to match the invoice/description. \n- Looking at the current listing, the \"recorded amount\" for \"Fixed Assets\" is 8000000.\n- The “example” set had this as 5,000,000 (which created a discrepancy), but in the data shown here, it is correctly entered as 8,000,000.\n- However, perhaps a historical or copy-paste error in the entries that carried over the previous value.\n- But **since the description and line all say 8,000,000** now, this is not actually an error in the data as pasted above. If the recorded amount **was 5,000,000** in your system, it would be a discrepancy; in this data, it is 8,000,000. So let's skip this.\n\n#### 2. Sale20240124074 – Administrative Expenses recorded as Sale\n\n- Entry:\n  - `id: Sale20240124074`\n  - `recorded_type: Administrative Expenses`\n  - `recorded_amount: 7762.79`\n  - `product_id: F003` (`Deluxe Meal Set`)\n  - `recorded_quantity: 4.0`\n  - `recorded_unit_price: 1800.1`\n  - `recorded_cost_per_unit: 880.0`\n  - Tax: 6933.29 (!)\n  - Description in invoice: \"... an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 4.0 units at a unit price of $1579.35, totaling $6317.40. The cost amount was $3520.00, tax $315.87, after-tax $6001.53...\"\n\n- Discrepancies:\n  - Category: recorded as “Administrative Expenses”, should be “Sale” (per invoice and all other lines, as well as ID pattern).\n  - Amount: should be 4 * 1579.35 = 6317.40 (per invoice), but recorded is 7762.79.\n  - Unit price: should be 1579.35, but recorded is 1800.1.\n  - Tax: should be 315.87, but recorded is 6933.29 (!! Massive error here).\n  - After-tax amount: should be 6001.53 (invoice), currently missing or mismatched.\n\n#### 3. Other systematic review\n\n- No other entries with mismatches in type/amount/unit price/tax/after-tax are found in the sample presented (though a full automation would scan all rows).\n- \"Preparer\" and \"Approver\" are sometimes listed as \"Supervisor\" or \"Staff\" interchangeably, but if the invoice matches, it's not an internal error.\n\n### Final Output Structure (summarizing all above):\n\n- For Sale20240124074 (Administrative Expenses wrongly entered for Sale, amount/unit/tax error)\n- For Initial20231231001, no error as the amount currently matches the invoice in your data.\n\n**If you want the former example error about Initial20231231001 included, simply replace the \"Fixed Assets\" amount with 5000000 for the error. In this data, it's now correct.**\n\n---\n\n#### If you want a flat single error result instead of a list, use just the Sale20240124074 error, but best practice gives you all issues found as an array/list.",
