All other information matches and/or is not reliably overwritten by the invoice.\n- All other fields (category, status, payment/receipt, methods, preparer, approver, etc.) appear in alignment with description/invoice or don't have evidence of mismatch. \n\n**For maximal clarity, only the fields with concrete mismatches (as revealed by invoice vs. row) are populated above; other fields are left null as per example format.**",
