The invoice describes an invoice for a Fixed Assets, totaling $8,000,000.00.\n   - The sum of \"Cash deposit\" (3,000,000) + \"Bank deposit\" (5,000,000) == \"Fixed Assets\" (8,000,000), matching the invoice's total.\n   - This suggests the correct single invoice at id Initial20231231001 is for Fixed Assets, $8,000,000. The individual cash/bank deposit entries are not represented in the invoice's description for this row.\n   - **Inconsistency**: The amount for \"Fixed Assets\" was incorrectly separated (possibly duplication as part of the initial capital outlay), but the invoice shows $8,000,000—this is the authoritative amount for this id.\n\n2. **ID: Sale20240108027**\n   - Recorded date: 2024-01-14 | Invoice says issued on Jan 8, 2024.\n   - Recorded unit price: 498.47 | Invoice says 464.58.\n   - The invoice, considered reliable, states 5 units × $464.58 = $2,322.90 is the correct calculation for the amount (matches 5×464.58), not 5×498.47.\n   - **Inconsistencies**: unit price and date.\n\n---\n\nFor all other rows in the presented data, the invoice content matches the sum or details of amount, date, and unit price with the row fields. There are some systematically repeated rows (for, e.g., Interest Receivables) with amounts matching invoice description, so no error unless recorded values contradict invoice.\n\nIf you meant for *all* rows with accidental mismatches to be listed, only the above two explicit inconsistencies are found in the snapshot provided.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \n- In the first case, it's mainly about reconciling the proper \"Fixed Assets\" entry at $8,000,000; the other \"split out\" entries are not reflected in the invoice and are potentially erroneous.\n- In the second case (Sale20240108027), both the recorded date and unit price contradict the invoice.\n\nIf you expected every \"null\" field to be flagged as an error, that is not appropriate per your directions. The task is to highlight inconsistencies where the invoice (as reliable) explicitly disagrees with the recorded fields.  \nIf you meant to list every row, clarify with more examples—based on existing instructions, this is the correct solution.",
