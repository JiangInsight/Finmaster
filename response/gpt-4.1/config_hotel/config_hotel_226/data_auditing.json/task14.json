The Fixed Assets row should total $8,000,000 (sum of cash and bank deposits). This row matches the total in the invoice, so it's correct. However, in your input, the earlier code solution would flag this, but since they’re only inconsistent as multiple rows sharing the same id with different types and amounts, and all three rows are given (and the sum matches), there’s not an actual within-row error. Therefore, we acknowledge it but no inconsistent value to correct per row.\n\n- In row `Purchase20231231018`, the **invoice** says \"Purchase, 185 units at $350 = $64,750\", but the row records 177 units and $61,950.00, marked as \"Paid\", but the invoice details state payment_method was \"account payable\", and the transaction was \"unpaid\". Therefore, the recorded quantity and amount should be 185 and $64,750.00, payment_method should be \"Account Payable\", and payment/receipt_status should be \"Unpaid\".\n\n_Note: If only one row per id is to be checked, remove the first one, but CleanLab format is per row, not per id. In this example, the task specifically asked for within each row. No other inconsistencies are present (unit price x quantity == total, and payment statuses match invoice) in the remaining provided rows._\n```",
