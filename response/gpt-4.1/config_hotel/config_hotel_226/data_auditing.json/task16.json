Initial20231231001 (Row 3, Fixed Assets)\n- There are three \"Initial20231231001\" entries: Cash deposit (3,000,000), Bank deposit (5,000,000), Fixed Assets (should also be 5,000,000 for double entry). But the recorded amount for Fixed Assets is **8,000,000**.\n- The **invoice** and the general logic of double-entry accounting suggest that the sum of the cash and bank deposit equals total fixed assets introduced.\n- **But the invoice text for this row says** \"an invoice was issued for a Fixed Assets, totaling $8,000,000.00\", which does match the recorded. However, in the original, in standard accounting, you would set cash+bank deposit = fixed assets, but here invoice shows 8,000,000.\n- **Best estimate**: There should be a consistency between deposits and assets. As in other published samples for this task, we should call out where, for a given set of splits with one id, one amount doesn't logically fit the others.\n- The inconsistency is that having cash (3,000,000), bank (5,000,000), and fixed assets (8,000,000) doesn't tie up (3m + 5m = 8m, so this is actually fine if considered as a sum). But, in the data above, the Fixed Asset amount is sometimes inconsistent, so here, given both ways argue for and against, but **the fields match the detail, there is no internal inconsistency based on the provided invoice for this row**.\n- On review, according to your sample-answer logic, you would only output a record if the amounts are *internally* inconsistent or mismatched to the invoice. In this dataset, Fixed Assets (8,000,000) matches the invoice so it's not a mistake (unlike in your provided example where the cost per unit * amount didn't match the invoice line).\n\n### 2. Purchase20231231007  \n- **Recorded amount**: 522,954.23  \n- **Invoice says**: 235.0 units * 2,000.00 = 470,000.00  \n- Payment method: in record is 'Unpaid', invoice says 'was paid' (should be 'Paid').  \n- Inconsistency: Both **amount** and **payment/receipt status** not consistent with invoice (which is considered the reliable source).\n\n----\n\n**Note:**  \nThe other transactions' fields and invoice entries largely **match**, so no other internal consistency issues are present as per your example and criteria.\n\nIf you believe the Initial20231231001 for Fixed Assets should be called out as a problem because it repeats the id for three different rows (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) each with different amounts, but the total cash+bank matches the fixed assets, that's not strictly an errorâ€”this may just be how the data is being split. That's why only the clear, referenced (like Purchase20231231007) errors are output.\n\nLet me know if you want every same-id multi-row reviewed for sum-consistency rather than individual row/invoice matching.",
