But:  \n    - Cash deposit $3,000,000  \n    - Bank deposit $5,000,000  \n    - Fixed Assets $**8,000,000** (problem input)  \n- But in the *example* section in the prompt, for the same scenario, \"Fixed Assets\" is actually recorded as **$5,000,000**, not $8,000,000, aligning with the sum of the prior deposits.  \n- Here, \"Fixed Assets\" is written as $8,000,000, but the sum of \"Cash deposit\" and \"Bank deposit\" is $8,000,000, yet the invoice in the rest of the data is handled as $5,000,000.  \n- Given the pattern (Cash + Bank = Fixed Assets) and consistency with examples, the correct value for \"Fixed Assets\" should be **$8,000,000**, matching the sum of the two deposits. In the problem table, it's already $8,000,000, so no inconsistency here.\n- However, in the *example* the same id has \"Fixed Assets\" at $5,000,000, suggesting a historic inconsistency—but not a current error in THIS RECORD.\n\n**No internal field inconsistencies for this row in the provided table: The deposit rows and Fixed Asset are additive and consistent as per the description.**\n\nIf you want to check other potential issues (as in the given *example*), none of the numbers on this row misalign with their invoice line. All purchase, sale, and expense transaction rows in this table match their invoice totals (quantity × unit price = amount, etc.), and there is no clear mistake between the numbers and descriptions.\n\n**For the rest of the data, the only notable internal inconsistency (clearly shown in example) appears in:**\n- `Sale20240117052`\n    - Invoice: \"consisting of 5.0 units at a unit price of $3174.45, totaling $15872.25. The cost amount ... $10000.00... profit: ???\"\n    - Cost: $10000.00, Amount: $15872.25 -- thus profit = $15872.25 - $10000.00 = $5872.25.\n    - Recorded profit = **$7276.20** (`recorded_profit` field)\n    - So, inconsistency arises here.\n\n**Therefore, output should capture this inconsistency:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"Original category\": null,\n    \"Recorded category\": null,\n    \"Original date\": null,\n    \"Recorded date\": null,\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Original payment_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n    \"Original quantity\": null,\n    \"Recorded quantity\": null,\n    \"Original price\": null,\n    \"Recorded price\": null,\n    \"Original receive_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": null,\n    \"Original amount\": null,\n    \"Recorded amount\": null,\n    \"Original tax\": null,\n    \"Recorded tax\": null,\n    \"Original profit\": \"5872.25\",\n    \"Recorded profit\": \"7276.2\",\n    \"Original Preparer\": null,\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n    \"Original Approver\": null,\n    \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240117052\"\n}}\n```\n\n**Explanation**:  \n- The profit should be amount minus cost (`15872.25 - 10000.00 = 5872.25`), but the `recorded_profit` is `7276.2`, so there is an error in the profit calculation field. All other values are correct as per the reliable invoice description.\n\n**Final output (as per requested format, only for the entry with an inconsistency):**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"Original category\": null,\n    \"Recorded category\": null,\n    \"Original date\": null,\n    \"Recorded date\": null,\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Original payment_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n    \"Original quantity\": null,\n    \"Recorded quantity\": null,\n    \"Original price\": null,\n    \"Recorded price\": null,\n    \"Original receive_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": null,\n    \"Original amount\": null,\n    \"Recorded amount\": null,\n    \"Original tax\": null,\n    \"Recorded tax\": null,\n    \"Original profit\": \"5872.25\",\n    \"Recorded profit\": \"7276.2\",\n    \"Original Preparer\": null,\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n    \"Original Approver\": null,\n    \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240117052\"\n}}\n```\nThis is the primary and only clear inconsistency in the provided transaction entries.",
