All are internally consistent.\n\n**If more details needed about Initial20231231001â€™s redundancy** (e.g., multiple lines for initial capital in different components) or strict 1:1 ID matching, clarify further.\n\n**No further inconsistencies or errors found** in all other entries regarding amount, quantities, units, payment status, payment methods or responsible persons.",
