The only error in your *example data* was that \"Fixed Assets\" was $5,000,000 instead of the sum ($8,000,000), but in the *problem* they are all correct and match. Thus, no inconsistency to report.\n- For Expense20240120001, invoice says status \"Paid\", record shows \"Unpaid\". This is a discrepancy.\n- For Interest20240121021, invoice says \"Unpaid\", record shows \"Paid\". Discrepancy.\n\nFor the rest, scanning for formula mismatches or text mismatches (amount, payment status, payment method, etc.)â€”no inconsistencies stand out with the fields shown or cross-calculated. All expense, sale, purchase etc. entries have amounts matching what their quantity * unit price would yield, and payment statuses match their invoice notes unless otherwise noted above.\n\n**If you require only mismatches (discrepancies), only report for \"Expense20240120001\" and \"Interest20240121021\" (as shown above).**  \nIf you want all rows listed, please clarify (but there will be lots of unnecessary repetition for consistent entries).",
