All other fields for this row, and all other rows, agree with the invoice text or are not contradictory (where invoice is silent or the field is not relevant).\n\n**Note:** All other fields (\"payment/receipt_status\", \"payment_method\", etc) match the invoice descriptions in their respective rows. If you believe another inconsistency is present, please specify the row(s) for deeper checking.",
