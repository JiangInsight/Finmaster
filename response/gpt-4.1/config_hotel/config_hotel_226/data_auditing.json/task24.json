There are other entries with the same id for \"Cash deposit\" and \"Bank deposit,\" but since the invoice description clearly says the Fixed Assets is 8000000, not 5000000, the correct value is the one from the invoice (8000000.00). The recorded and invoice values match, so it's consistent.  \n  *No change required.*\n\n- **Row 7 (id: Purchase20231231002):**  \n  The invoice states: \"242.0 units at a unit price of $2880.00, totaling $696960.00.\"  \n  The recorded data, however, says:\n    - recorded_quantity: 242.0\n    - recorded_unit_price: 3447.36 (SHOULD BE 2880.00)\n    - recorded_amount: 838311.78 (SHOULD BE 696960.00)\n  So both the price and amount are incorrect.\n  \n  *Both 'unit_price' and 'amount' are overwritten with the correct invoice values.*\n\n---\n\n**Summary/explanation**:  \n- For \"Sale\", \"Purchase\", etc., the invoice narrative gives the \"Original\" (reliable) values for amount, price, and so forth. If the recorded fields differ from what is stated in the invoice, list that as the inconsistency.\n- Repeat this process for each row; here only two rows had discrepancies (one fixed asset, one purchase).  \n- If a row is included in the output, it is because there is a discrepancy; if not included, it was consistent.\n\nLet me know if you want more inconsistencies checked!\n```",
