Initial20231231001 (Fixed Assets)\n- There are three distinct transactions under the same ID, but the invoice for \"Fixed Assets\" says $8,000,000.00, while recorded_amount is $8000000.0, which matches. This may not be a true inconsistency unless you count the fact that the sum of \"Cash deposit\" ($3M), \"Bank deposit\" ($5M), and \"Fixed Assets\" ($8M) exceeds what's possible if those are debits from the same transaction (unless one is a reclassification), but given only row-by-row context, no concrete internal error can be computed.\n\n- **However, if you consider possible double-counting or single-item discrepancy, the invoice for the fixed assets should match the cash + bank amounts (if they're all the same event), but as per the invoice, each is its own entry.**\n  - Strictly, from the invoice for \"Fixed Assets\", $8,000,000.00 is shown as correct.\n\n- So, no field-level internal error in the actual row, but the ID is linked to three invoices for different types with inconsistent overall logic. For this task, nothing to correct in the field values.\n\n### 2. Sale20240107019\n- Invoice: \"On January 07, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of **4.0 units at a unit price of $490.01, totaling $1960.04**...\"\n- Row: recorded_quantity: 3.0; recorded_amount: 1470.03; recorded_profit: 524.04; recorded_payment/receipt_status: Paid.\n- Invoice implies recorded_quantity should be 4.0, recorded_amount 1960.04, and payment/receipt_status should be Unpaid (matching other \"Account Receivable\" sales).\n- So,\n  - recorded_quantity incorrect (should be 4.0)\n  - recorded_amount incorrect (should be 1960.04)\n  - recorded_profit incorrect (should be 560.04, as per invoice: 1960.04 (amt) - 1400 (3x 350 cost) = 560.04, though profit calc could be different if invoice is strictly followed).\n  - recorded_payment/receipt_status should be \"Unpaid\"\n- All these are mismatches.\n  \n### 3. All other rows\n- All other purchase, sales, expense, and interest lines match between the key columns and their reliable invoice string, with no internal computation errors (multiplies correctly for amount, payment status, method, quantity, etc)\n\n### Final Output\n- The relevant rows with inconsistencies are the above.\n- The output JSON sums up the differences for the identified rows.\n",
