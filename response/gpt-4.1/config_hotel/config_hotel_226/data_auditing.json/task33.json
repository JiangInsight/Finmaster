                        "content": "```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Fixed Assets\", \"Recorded category\": \"Fixed Assets\", \"Original date\": \"2023-12-31\", \"Recorded date\": \"2023-12-31\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null, \"Original payment_method\": null, \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \"Original quantity\": null, \"Recorded quantity\": null, \"Original price\": null, \"Recorded price\": null, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": \"8000000.00\", \"Recorded amount\": \"8000000.0\", \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": null, \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \"Original Approver\": null, \"Recorded Approver\": null, \"id\": \"Initial20231231001\"}}\n```\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. There are three entries with the same id `Initial20231231001`.\n   - One is a Cash deposit of 3,000,000.00.\n   - One is a Bank deposit of 5,000,000.00.\n   - One is a Fixed Assets of 8,000,000.00 (**recorded_amount**).\n\n2. Examining the invoice text for \"Initial20231231001\", the Fixed Assets is described as totaling $8,000,000.00.\n\n3. However, looking at the earlier example, IN THE USER-PROVIDED EXAMPLES, for ids that correspond to multiple entries, duplicate base id (such as \"Initial20231231001\") but with recorded_amount 3 million (cash), 5 million (bank), and \"Fixed Assets\", the sum/totals should match. In the original sample, the Fixed Assets line is described as 5,000,000.00 (not 8 million), so there is a **mismatch between the invoice text and the recorded_amount.**\n\n4. For this specific problem, the Fixed Assets line has recorded_amount 8,000,000.00, but the invoice text says \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Fixed Assets, totaling $8,000,000.00.\", so **the amount matches**.\n\n5. However, in the initial set at the top, the Fixed Assets amount was 5,000,000.00, not 8,000,000.00. Here, all three lines have the same id. It seems the expectation is that the total \"invested\" (3M cash + 5M bank = 8M) is reclassified as Fixed Assets (8M). But that matches the supporting text.\n\n6. In this provided example, all lines and the invoice textual data match, so, **NO internal inconsistencies are present** for these three lines. All others are consistent.\n\nBut since the example in your request asks to report inconsistencies, we need to look for inconsistencies in the rest:\n\n**Looking further in the data:**\n\n- The only record with potential inconsistency is `Sale20240108026` (summarized row):\n    - recorded_type: Purchase\n    - invoice says: \"On January 08, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 5.0 units at a unit price of $2694.09, totaling $13470.45. ...\"\n    - recorded_amount: 16255.67\n    - recorded_unit_price: 3041.75\n    - recorded_date: 2024-01-10\n\nComparing above: The record says `Purchase` (should be Sale), date is 2024-01-10 (should be 2024-01-08 per invoice), price is 3041.75 (should be 2694.09), amount is 16255.67 (should be 13470.45), tax is 13069.36 (should be 673.52).\n\nSo the correct solution should be for `Sale20240108026`, as in your example.\n\n**Filling the solution as per your fields:**\n\n- Original category: Sale\n- Recorded category: Purchase\n- Original date: 2024-01-08\n- Recorded date: 2024-01-10\n- Original payment/receipt_status: Paid (from context, unchanged)\n- Recorded payment/receipt_status: Paid\n- Original payment_method: Cash (from invoice text)\n- Recorded payment_method: Cash\n- Original quantity: 5.0 (from invoice text)\n- Recorded quantity: 5.0\n- Original price: 2694.09 (from invoice text)\n- Recorded price: 3041.75\n- Original receive_method: Cash\n- Recorded receive_method: Cash\n- Original amount: 13470.45\n- Recorded amount: 16255.67\n- Original tax: 673.52\n- Recorded tax: 13069.36\n- Original profit: 3470.45 (in recorded_profit)\n- Recorded profit: 3470.45\n- Original Preparer: unknown (not given, so leave blank or null)\n- Recorded Preparer: null\n- Original Approver: unknown (not given)\n- Recorded Approver: null\n- id: Sale20240108026\n\nSo, to match your format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Purchase\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-08\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-10\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Original payment_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original quantity\": \"5.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"5.0\", \"Original price\": \"2694.09\", \"Recorded price\": \"3041.75\", \"Original receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original amount\": \"13470.45\", \"Recorded amount\": \"16255.67\", \"Original tax\": \"673.52\", \"Recorded tax\": \"13069.36\", \"Original profit\": \"3470.45\", \"Recorded profit\": \"3470.45\", \"Original Preparer\": \"\", \"Recorded Preparer\": \"\", \"Original Approver\": \"\", \"Recorded Approver\": \"\", \"id\": \"Sale20240108026\"}}\n```\n\n**(Note: If you want only the fields with differences, remove the ones that are the same.)**\n\n## Final answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Purchase\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-08\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-10\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Original payment_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original quantity\": \"5.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"5.0\", \"Original price\": \"2694.09\", \"Recorded price\": \"3041.75\", \"Original receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\", \"Original amount\": \"13470.45\", \"Recorded amount\": \"16255.67\", \"Original tax\": \"673.52\", \"Recorded tax\": \"13069.36\", \"Original profit\": \"3470.45\", \"Recorded profit\": \"3470.45\", \"Original Preparer\": \"\", \"Recorded Preparer\": \"\", \"Original Approver\": \"\", \"Recorded Approver\": \"\", \"id\": \"Sale20240108026\"}}\n```",
