For `Initial20231231001`, thereâ€™s an internal inconsistency in the `recorded_amount` among the three entries for the same transaction ID (`Cash deposit: 3,000,000`, `Bank deposit: 5,000,000`, and `Fixed Assets: 8,000,000`). When an invoice is issued and states a total of $8,000,000 for \"Fixed Assets,\" but other entries for the transaction ID show smaller differing totals and types (cash/bank), one of these must be wrong. Since \"invoice\" is more reliable and total investment should generally match the sum of cash outlay and deposits, it's likely the recorded \"Fixed Assets\" value ($8,000,000) is based on combining both deposits; the entries for \"Cash deposit\" ($3M) and \"Bank deposit\" ($5M) may just be part entries, not an inconsistency, but if all share the same id, they should aggregate to match the fixed assets. Since the current row reflects the invoice, its value is kept as baseline, so technically this is a warning for internal consistency but not a concrete necessary correction unless the split was misallocated.\n2. For `Purchase20231231002`, the recorded category says \"Financial Expenses,\" but the invoice and all transaction detail fields indicate this is a \"Purchase.\" Therefore, the `recorded_category` should be \"Purchase.\"\n",
