The sum of cash deposit (3,000,000) and bank deposit (5,000,000) is 8,000,000, matching the fixed assets line. However, normally, in properly maintained records, this would be split with unique IDs or more fields (could be an aggregate in the 'Fixed Assets' field and sub-entries in the others). There is an internal inconsistency (multiple amounts for same ID and unclear categorization) but all values sum up; so I present possible needed splits.\n\n- Case 3: \"Expense20240106001\" (Administrative Expenses, 2024-01-06): The invoice text says the transaction was prepared by Staff, but \"recorded_preparer\" is blank. The correct value should be \"Staff\".\n\nOther records in your sample have no inconsistencies between their recorded values and invoice narrative based on the provided data. If there are more inconsistencies you'd like caught, please clarify or provide their details.",
