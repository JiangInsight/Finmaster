it does, but if not, this would raise a red flag.\n\n   > **No actual inconsistency in calculations or fields according to the invoice narrative and recorded data.**\n\n2. **Sale20240114044: Recorded Quantity**  \n   - The invoice states: \"On January 14, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $577.85, totaling $577.85.\"  \n   - In the row, recorded_quantity is **0.0**; but invoice and all price fields (unit/amount/cost/tax/profit) are for 1 unit; cost amount, tax amount, and after-tax amount match a single unit sale.  \n   - **This is an error**: the quantity should be 1.0, not 0.0.\n\n3. **All other sample entries seem in line (e.g., purchases, sales in the 236@150 purchase, amounts and units all match). Other risk_issues are not flagged unless a standardization/narrative/record discrepancy is shown.**\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \n- The only data row with a clear, direct internal inconsistency disclosed by the invoice/narrative is for `Sale20240114044`, with `recorded_quantity` wrongly listed as `0` (it should be `1`).  \n- Other entries in this block are consistent within themselves, or the match between the invoice and the book fields is exact.\n- All entries for the initial balance are included to show reconciliation, even though no inconsistency exists.\n\nIf you want only transactions with *actual field inconsistencies* to be listed (i.e., only `Sale20240114044`), just let me know!",
