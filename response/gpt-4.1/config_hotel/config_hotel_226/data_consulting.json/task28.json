Therefore, the correct result is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.32\", \n  \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"36.03%\", \n  \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.13\"\n} }\n```\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.32\", \n  \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"36.03%\", \n  \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.13\"\n} }\n```",
