Thus, the profit should be 11935.53.\n   - CONSISTENCY ERRORS: 'recorded_receive_method' should be \"Account Receviable\"; 'recorded_profit' should be 11935.53.\n\n3. **Other entries in the provided sample do not display internal inconsistencies in their primary monetary fields when compared to the invoice description.**\n\n**Note:** All other fields are either consistent or not possible to verify due to lack of explicit invoice statement about, for example, who prepared/approved. The corrections focus on:\n- Ensure the receive_method and profit, where the invoice gives evidence, match.\n",
