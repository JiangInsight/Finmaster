All three records at the top have the same `id` (Initial20231231001) but different `recorded_type` (\"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\") and different amounts. According to reliable invoice text:\n    - \"Cash deposit, totaling $3,000,000.00\",\n    - \"Bank deposit, totaling $5,000,000.00\",\n    - \"Fixed Assets, totaling $5,000,000.00\".\n2. However, in the actual tabular data, *all three records* share the same `id`, which should not be the case for different transaction types with different amounts by standard bookkeeping practice.\n3. The `recorded_amount` does not match the amount mentioned in the other invoice narratives (which would be authoritative).\n4. Therefore, for the record where recorded_type is \"Cash deposit\" and amount 3,000,000 (matches its invoice text), its assignment is correct, but the other two lines with the same ID are mismatched in both category and amount—they should be separate transactions.\n5. The correction is to split these three records into three separate transactions, each with a unique id. \n6. Since we can't infer what the *intended* id was for the Bank deposit and Fixed Assets, we are reporting the category, amount, and id as inconsistent with the invoice's description. The \"original\" value is what should have been recorded according to the invoice (treated as authoritative), the \"recorded\" is what got recorded for the id.\n\n**Other rows (after careful review):**\n- The rest of the rows are internally consistent—the category matches invoice and line values, the amounts line up with invoice. The only other error present in the example was the payment/receipt_status mismatch (and that risk_issue is shown as caught already and matches the example).\n- Thus, only the \"Initial20231231001\" needs reporting for this specific data.\n\n**Formatting each output record as per specification**.",
