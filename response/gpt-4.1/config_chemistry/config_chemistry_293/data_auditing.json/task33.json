The cost amount for this transaction was $30,000.00, with a tax amount of $1,983.17, leading to a total amount due of $37,680.13. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n- But the recorded entry (ID Sale20240126059) states:\n  - recorded_type: Depreciation (**should be Sale**)\n  - recorded_date: 2024-01-31 (**should be 2024-01-26**)\n  - recorded_amount: 47350.21 (**should be 39663.30**)\n  - recorded_quantity: 3.0 (**correct**)\n  - recorded_unit_price: 10858.57 (**should be 13221.10**)\n  - recorded_tax_amount: 45044.82 (**should be 1983.17**)\n  - receive_method: Account Receviable (**correct**)\n- Therefore, the output above lists all fields where an inconsistency exists and provides the (original=correct, recorded=what's in the table) values. All other fields are included for completeness and marked as null or left as is if there is \"no discrepancy.\"",
