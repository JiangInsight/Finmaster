The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"), the amount should be 375.58, status Unpaid.\n- In the table, the amount was recorded as 438.32 and the status as Paid, both incorrect.\n- All other fields for this record are either blank or match.\n- No other entry in the sample has a conflicting value against its own invoice text for core fields (amount, payment/receipt status, etc), so only this transaction is reported.",
