The receive_method for this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n  - Also, the \"risk_issues\" column points out mismatches: `{'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'id': 'Sale20240105007'}, {'Original quantity': 4.0, 'Recorded quantity': 3, 'id': 'Sale20240105007'}`\n\n- In the record:\n  - `recorded_type` = \"Sales Expenses\" (should be \"Sale\")\n  - `recorded_quantity` = 3.0 (should be 4.0)\n  - `recorded_amount` = 72578.16 (should be 96770.88 (= 4 * 24192.72))\n  - `recorded_receive_method` is \"Cash\", which is correct.\n  - The other details (tax, profit, payment status) appear consistent.\n  - `recorded_payment_method` is blank/missing (should be \"Cash\" per the invoice).\n\nThus, the solution lists the mismatched fields along with the correct value from invoice/best estimate based on row data.",
