The cost amount for this transaction was $80,000.00, with a tax amount of $4,484.37, leading to a total amount due of $85,203.03. The receive_method of this transaction was account receivable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n- However, the data row for `Sale20240118039` records:\n  - recorded_date: 2024-02-07 (should be 2024-01-18)\n  - recorded_quantity: 2.00 (should be 4.00)\n  - recorded_unit_price: 25778.19 (should be 22421.85)\n  - recorded_amount: 44843.70 (should be 89687.40)\n\nOther fields like tax, profit, Preparer, and Approver are not clearly mismatched (or not present in both sources), but the main inconsistencies are clearly:\n- date, quantity, price, amount. \n\nThe rest are consistent or not specified.\n\n**Explanation:**\n- \"Original\" values taken from the invoice text (considered reliable).\n- \"Recorded\" values are those in the table row.\n- The double of the \"recorded_amount\" matches the \"original_amount\" (i.e. 2 x 44,843.70 â‰ˆ 89,687.40), so looks like a data entry halved all the core numbers and mistakenly set the wrong date.",
