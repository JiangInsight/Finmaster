For `Sale20240106009`, the invoice (reliable source) indicates \"3.0\" units sold at $22,602.25 per unit, total $67,806.75, and marked as \"Paid\". But the recorded data has only 2 units, amount $45,204.50, status \"Unpaid\", profit does not match.\n    - The correct values (from invoice) should be: quantity 3, amount 67806.75, payment status \"Paid\", profit 7806.75.\n\n2. For `Sale20240103006`, the invoice (reliable) specifies \"3.0\" units at $11,037.25, total $33,111.75, \"Unpaid\", \"Account Receivable\", profit $3111.75. But the record has only 2 units, total $22,074.50, status \"Paid\", profit $3939.65.\n    - The correct values (from invoice) should be: quantity 3, amount 33111.75, payment status \"Unpaid\", profit 3111.75.\n\n3. All other sampled entries did not show an internal inconsistency between the invoice (trusted source) and the recorded fields, as all key numbers (category, quantities, amount, method, etc.) aligned in the context provided.\n\n**Note**: The rest of the records either lacked enough numeric detail in the invoice to cross-check (such as those for administrative expenses, transfers, interests which all matched their header), or matched perfectly. If more inconsistencies exist, please specify a row reference or request a further subset check.",
