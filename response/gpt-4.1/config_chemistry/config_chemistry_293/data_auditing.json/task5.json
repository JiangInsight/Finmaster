Therefore, an internal inconsistency is present â€“ the number shown in the invoice is almost always more reliable, so the correct values should likely be 5.0 and $64374.65.\n\n- For the other listed transactions, there are no internal inconsistencies between the invoice and the recorded fields for purchase/sale/expense. All totals, categories, statuses, and quantities match.\n\n- Only include inconsistencies; for records where there is no internal inconsistency, they are not listed here.\n\nNotice: Most entries match precisely; only one transaction has a clear field mismatch.",
