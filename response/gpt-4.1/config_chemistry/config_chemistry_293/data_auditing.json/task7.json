The invoice (considered most reliable) states receive method = **Cash**, but the recorded field is \"Interest receivable\".  \nAll other fields match the invoice.\n\n**No other inconsistencies detected** in the sample given above; other fields for all entries align with the invoice narrative, typical data cross-referencing, and expected calculations based on quantities, unit prices, cost/unit, etc. \n\nIf you want exhaustive step-by-step reasoning for each field/row, let me know!",
