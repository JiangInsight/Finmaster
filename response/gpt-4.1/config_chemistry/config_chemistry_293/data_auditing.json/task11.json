The only field truly in error is \"Preparer\"; all other fields match or are consistent. Both are also mis-categorized in the record compared to the detailed invoice for that specific transaction.\n\n**If you wish to limit the answer to records where only the Preparer is inconsistent (as in the sample answer), you may omit 'Original category' and 'Recorded category' for these and restrict to:**\n```json\n{\n    \"solution\": [\n        {\n            \"Original Preparer\": \"Staff\",\n            \"Recorded Preparer\": \"None\",\n            \"id\": \"Expense20240125001\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"Original Preparer\": \"Staff\",\n            \"Recorded Preparer\": \"None\",\n            \"id\": \"Expense20240115001\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**No other internal inconsistencies were detected among the given sample records using the guidance about invoice text as the reference.**",
