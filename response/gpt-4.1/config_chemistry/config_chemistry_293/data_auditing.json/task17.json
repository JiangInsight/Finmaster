The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n   - recorded_receive_method = Cash\n\n2. **Check what the invoice says vs. the recorded fields:**\n   - Invoice clearly says this is an \"Interest Receivables\", not a Sale.\n   - Invoice says receive_method was \"interest receviable\", but recorded_receive_method is \"Cash\".\n   - The rest is not specified in the problem, so we use null for fields not deducible.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The inconsistency is that the transaction is recorded as category \"Sale\" and receive_method \"Cash\", when it should be \"Interest Receivables\" and \"Interest receviable\".\n\n4. **Output:**\n   - Fill in the json format with observed and corrected values (the rest as null where not inferable).",
