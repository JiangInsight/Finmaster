The payment_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid. [...]\n\nBut in the structured data, `recorded_payment_method` is `Account Payable`.  \nAll other expense transactions (All other Sales Expenses/Administrative Expenses/Financial Expenses on that date and generally in the table) use payment method `Cash` for expenses, as also confirmed in the invoice narrative.\n\nTherefore, the payment method should be `Cash`, not `Account Payable`.\n\nNo other field inconsistency is found in this record.",
