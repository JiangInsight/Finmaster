This typically appears as the sum of the initial subscriptions to capital (can include cash, bank deposits, and in-kind contributions like fixed assets).\n\n2. **Find Initial Paid-in Capital**:\n   - Look for entries with type or id “Initial...” as these usually represent capital subscriptions/contributions.\n   - In the data provided, we see these entries:\n     - | Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | ... | amount: 3000000.0\n     - | Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | ... | amount: 5000000.0\n     - | Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | ... | amount: 5000000.0\n   - Total Paid-in Capital Initial Value = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = **13,000,000.00**\n\n3. **Check for Capital Increases/Decreases**:\n   - Review all transactions for additional “Paid-in capital” or capital increase, or decrease/return of capital entries.\n   - The rest of the data consists of Purchases, Sales, Expenses, Interest Receivables, Transfers, and Depreciation.\n   - No entries indicate additional paid-in capital being contributed, nor any capital reductions.\n   - Transfers and ordinary expenses do not affect Paid-in Capital, but rather affect asset/liability or profit/loss accounts.\n\n4. **Result**:\n   - Since there are no further entries changing the owner’s equity, **the Paid-in Capital End Value remains 13,000,000.00.**\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nPaid-in Capital does not change unless there are new capital injections or reductions. Only the initial contributions count for this item on the balance sheet.",
