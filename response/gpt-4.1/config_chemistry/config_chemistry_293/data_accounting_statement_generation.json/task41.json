Identify Purchases on Account (Account Payable)\n\nWe look for purchases with \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Payable\" in `payment/receipt_status` or `payment_method`. \n\nFrom the table, these are:\n\n1. | Purchase20231231009 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 800000.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n2. | Purchase20231231012 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 1300000.0 | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n\nCheck further for any other purchases:\n- All other purchases are Paid (Bank Transfer/Cash).\n\n## 2. Initial Balance of Accounts Payable\n\nCheck if there is any beginning balance for AP:\n- No initial account payable noted in the data (`Initial...` entries are for cash, bank, and fixed assets).\n\nSo, **beginning balance = 0**.\n\n## 3. Purchases on Credit (Increase AP)\n\n- Purchase20231231009: 800,000.00\n- Purchase20231231012: 1,300,000.00\n\n**Total purchases on account during the period = 800,000.00 + 1,300,000.00 = 2,100,000.00**\n\n## 4. Payments to Suppliers (Decrease AP)\n\nDid the company pay any portion of outstanding payables? In the table, \"Paid\" purchases are all either \"Bank Transfer\" or \"Cash\". All unpaid purchase entries above are at 2023-12-31 and not shown as settled by 2024-01-30.\n\n**Therefore, no decrease in AP is observed from these particular entries.**\n\n## 5. Ending Balance of Accounts Payable\n\n- Beginning AP Balance: 0\n- Plus: Purchases on Account: 2,100,000.00\n- Less: Payments made against AP: 0\n\n**Ending AP Balance = 2,100,000.00**\n\n## 6. Change in Account Payable for Cash Flow Statement\n\n**Increase in Accounts Payable = Ending Balance - Beginning Balance = 2,100,000.00 - 0 = 2,100,000.00**\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"2100000.00\"} }\n```",
