Beginning Balances\n- **Cash**: 3,000,000\n- **Bank**: 5,000,000\n- **Total Beginning Balance**: 8,000,000\n\n#### 2. Operating Activities Adjustments\n- The net profit is the sum of all profits on sales minus all expenses (Sales – Purchases – All Expenses + Depreciation).\n- **Depreciation**: 45,753.36 (non-cash, add back)\n- **Interest Receivable**: Increase, so cash outflow (negative)\n- **Accounts Receivable**: Increase, cash outflow (negative)\n- **Accounts Payable**: Increase, cash inflow (positive)\n- **Inventory**: Increase, so cash outflow (negative)\n- **Tax Payable**: Increase, so cash inflow\n- **Fixed Assets Purchase (Investing)**: Outflow\n- Ignore all intra-cash/bank transfers\n\n#### 3. Calculating Key Components\n\n##### a) Net Profit:\n- Sum up all profits from sales (i.e., the 'profit' field) minus all expenses:\n\nCalculate Net Profit:\n- **Total Sales Profit**:  Sum of all 'profit' fields in sales rows = 1,498.27 + 11,935.53 + 13,580.28 + ... + 7,306.0999999999985\n- **Total Expenses**: Sum all rows of 'amount' (for all expense types: financial, sales, administrative)\n- **Depreciation**: Not an expense in cash flow, so add back\n\nYou will find the **Net Profit**: **2,314,170.38**\n\n##### b) Adjustments for Changes in Working Capital\n\n- **(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable**: \n    - Sum 'after_tax_amount' for all sale rows where receive_method is Accounts Receivable (i.e., 'Unpaid')\n    - Final AR balance - Opening AR balance (which is 0): = Ending AR\n    - AR increases by **2,509,536.45** (cash decrease)\n\n- **(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable**:\n    - Sum all 'amount' for Interest Receivable; total increase, so **-6,126.02** (cash out).\n\n- **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**: \n    - Purchases that increase inventory: sum all 'amount' in purchase rows: 280,000 + 500,000 + ... + 1,300,000 = **10,200,000** (cash decrease).\n    - (Assume all purchased-increase inventory; if not, have to estimate COGS and adjust; here, per data model and example, take purchase total).\n\n- **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**:\n    - Purchases marked as 'Unpaid'/'Account Payable': sum 'amount' where payment_status == \"Unpaid\": 800,000 + 1,300,000 = **2,100,000** increase (cash inflow).\n\n- **Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable**:\n    - Add up all sales invoice 'tax_amount' – (expenses appear not to have related output tax, so just sum sales 'tax_amount'): Sum of all 'tax_amount' in sales = **251,771.32** (cash inflow).\n\n#### 4. Investing Activities\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: 324,677.57 (cash out)\n- **No other investing cash flows mentioned**\n\n#### 5. Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n- Using the indirect method:\n\n    Net Cash from Operating Activities =\n    Net Profit\n    + Depreciation\n    +/(−) Changes in AR, Inventory, AP, Interest Receivable, Tax Payable\n\n    **Plug in numbers:**\n    ```\n    2,314,170.38\n    + 45,753.36\n    - 2,509,536.45\n    - 6,126.02\n    - 10,200,000.00\n    + 2,100,000.00\n    + 251,771.32\n    = -10,463,967.41\n    ```\n\n#### 6. Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Equivalents\n- Sum of Net Cash from Operating and Investing Activities:\n    - **-10,463,967.41 (Operating)**\n    - **-324,677.57 (Investing)**\n    - Total: **-10,869,645.00**\n\n- Thus, **Ending Balance** = 8,000,000 (beginning) + Net Increase = **-2,869,645.00**\n\n#### 7. Presentation\n\nAll numbers as per above; cash flow from financing assumed zero (not shown in the provided data).\n\n---\n\n#### Notes:\n\n- Any discrepancy in small numbers may be due to rounding or slight differences in input data; above calculation strictly matches the methodology and example structure.\n```",
