Let's look for \"Fixed Assets\" (type or asset_name), or other keywords.\n\nUpon review, this is the **only explicit fixed asset purchase** row in the provided problem data.\n\n## 3. **Scan for Fixed Asset Sales**\nNo rows like \"Fixed Asset Sale\" or inflow from PPE sale exist.\n\n## 4. **Sum All (Net Cash Flows from Investing Activities)**\n- Outflows: **Fixed Asset Purchase**: -324,677.57\n\nNo inflows.\n\n## 5. **Check for Edge Cases**\n- None of the \"Purchase\" rows are for inventory/raw materials only.\n- Ignore opening balance (initial Fixed Assets), as it's not a period transaction.\n\n## 6. **Conclusion**\n\nTherefore, **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities** = **-324,677.57**\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-324677.57\"} }\n```",
