Identify the Opening and Closing Balances of Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\n#### Initial Cash and equivalents:\n- Cash deposit (Initial): **3,000,000.00**\n- Bank deposit (Initial): **5,000,000.00**\n\n**Opening Cash & Equivalents = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Cash Inflows\n\n- **Sales:**\n  - Only include sales where \"receipt_status\" is \"Paid\" and \"receive_method\" is \"Cash\" (and perhaps Bank, if any, but here seems all cash goes to \"Cash\").\n  - All sales with \"Paid\" are cash inflow.\n\nLet's sum up all *Paid* Sales CASH receipts (amount):\n\n#### Extract all lines with `| Sale | ... | Paid | ... | Cash | ...` and sum their `amount`.  \n(We'll ignore any with 'Account Receivable' or if they're 'Unpaid'.)\nSimilarly, any \"Bank to cash\" transfer is internal, keep track of both internal transfers.\n\n#### **Sales Cash Receipts**\n\nLet's do it methodically by date and list only the matching lines as per above:\n\n#### List of Paid Sales (CASH):\n\n- Sale20240102002 | 11,498.27\n- Sale20240103004 | 93,580.28\n- Sale20240106009 | 67,806.75\n- Sale20240106010 | 116,898.14\n- Sale20240107011 | 659,298.95\n- Sale20240109015 |  (None)\n- Sale20240110015 | 35,930.91\n- Sale20240111017 | 67,132.14\n- Sale20240111018 | 134,717.66\n- Sale20240112020 | 644,182.5\n- Sale20240113024 | 25,216.28\n- Sale20240114027 | 620,407.25\n- Sale20240116031 | 59,166.45\n- Sale20240116032 | 231,037.8\n- Sale20240117034 | 75,890.52\n- Sale20240119041 | 117,441.68\n- Sale20240121047 | 552,114.2\n- Sale20240121051 | (none)\n- Sale20240122050 | 411,855.06\n- Sale20240122051 | 265,712.0\n- Sale20240123052 | 47,800.68\n- Sale20240124053 | 82,693.5\n- Sale20240124054 | 128,615.27\n- Sale20240126060 | 135,563.82\n- Sale20240127062 | 575,061.65\n- Sale20240129067 | 206,035.5\n- Sale20240130068 | 50,289.32\n- Sale20240130069 | 57,306.1\n\nLet's sum up these, but let's check if there were any multi-line items with the same Sale IDs to avoid duplicates (they look unique).
