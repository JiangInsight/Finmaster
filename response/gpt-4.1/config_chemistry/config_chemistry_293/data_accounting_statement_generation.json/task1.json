Only \"Cash to bank transfer\" are outflow.\n\nCheck all \"Transfer\" lines with id like \"Cash to bank transfer\" (i.e., \"Cash to bank transfer\" in description):\n\nLooking for lines like:\n- Transfer20240110001\n- Transfer20240111001\n- Transfer20240112001\n- Transfer20240124001\n- Transfer20240125001\n- Transfer20240127001\n- Transfer20240128001\n- Transfer20240129001\n\nEach appears multiple times, let's count occurrence per date:\n- Transfer20240110001: 6 times × 100,000 = 600,000.0\n- Transfer20240111001: 5 times × 100,000 = 500,000.0\n- Transfer20240112001: 6 times × 100,000 = 600,000.0\n- Transfer20240124001: 1 × 100,000 = 100,000.0\n- Transfer20240125001: 2 × 100,000 = 200,000.0\n- Transfer20240127001: 4 × 100,000 = 400,000.0\n- Transfer20240128001: 6 × 100,000 = 600,000.0\n- Transfer20240129001: 7 × 100,000 = 700,000.0\n\nSum:\n600,000\n+500,000=1,100,000\n+600,000=1,700,000\n+100,000=1,800,000\n+200,000=2,000,000\n+400,000=2,400,000\n+600,000=3,000,000\n+700,000=3,700,000\n\n**Total Cash to Bank Transfer = 3,700,000.0**\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Cash End Value Calculation**\nNow, use the formula:\n```\nCash End = Initial + Cash Inflows - Cash Outflows\n```\n\n### Cash Inflows\n- Sales cash receipts:            5,519,928.55\n- Bank to cash transfers:         1,600,000.00\n- Subtotal Cash Inflow:           7,119,928.55\n\n### Cash Outflows\n- Cash Usage for Purchases:       6,530,000.00\n- All Expenses paid by cash:      2,506,095.59\n- Cash to bank transfer:          3,700,000.00\n\nTotal Outflows: 6,530,000.00 + 2,506,095.59 + 3,700,000.00 = **12,736,095.59**\n\n#### That doesn't add up; let's check: \nBut recall that purchases (and expenses) paid by cash are both outflows, and cash to bank is a transfer out. There is one potential issue: Outflow to purchases/expenses AND cash to bank cannot exceed the available cash (starting plus inflows).\n\nLet’s assure we don't double-count expenditure (just sum as direct cash paid). In the example, \"Cash to bank\" transfer is an outflow, just as purchases/expenses are.\n\n**So, the calculation will be:**\n- Initial cash:                   3,000,000.00\n- Plus inflows:                   7,119,928.55\n- Minus cash outflows (purchases, expenses, cash to bank transfers):  \n    - Purchases:     6,530,000.00\n    - Expenses:      2,506,095.59\n    - Cash transfers:3,700,000.00\n\nTotal outflows: 12,736,095.59\n\nThus:\n\n`Cash End = 3,000,000.00 + 7,119,928.55 - 12,736,095.59`\n`Cash End = 10,119,928.55 - 12,736,095.59`\n`Cash End = -2,616,167.04`\n\n**But negative cash is not possible given the transaction flows. What's wrong here? Let's review:**\n\n#### Check for double-counting:\n\nIf some bank to cash transfer is being matched by a corresponding cash to bank transfer, perhaps we're not matching intra-account flows. Maybe bank->cash and cash->bank are both present, so only net bank transfers should be accounted for. In practice, cash to bank transfers are payments OUT of cash, bank to cash transfer is cash IN. Their net is what changes cash.\n\nSo instead of simply adding inflows/purchase/expense/transfer, perhaps we should:\n\n- Initial Cash\n- + All sales received in cash\n- + All \"Bank to cash\" transfer (actual inflow)\n- - All purchases paid by cash (actual outflow)\n- - All expenses paid by cash (actual outflow)\n- - All \"Cash to bank\" transfer (outflow)\n\nLet's simply sum all.\nBut in the example provided for reference, the final cash on hand was **270,005.90** for a similar set of heavy transaction flows. Our above calculation is not matching that pattern.\n\nLet us re-evaluate the calculation to ensure NOT to double count purchases: perhaps payments for purchases and expenses were **already paid out of the cash account** and bank to cash transfer/cash to bank transfer is only transfer between bank/cash—not additional movement.\n\n**Maybe we need to treat the bank/cash transfer as between accounts and only count:**\n\n- Initial Cash\n- Sales cash received\n- MINUS Purchases paid by cash\n- MINUS Expenses paid by cash\n\nEXCLUDING the bank/cash transfer since they don't change total cash+bank on hand.\n\nBut in the example, cash to bank transfer IS deducted. So we do:  \n- Start with initial cash\n- Plus cash sales\n- Plus bank to cash transfer\n- MINUS cash purchases, cash expenses, cash to bank transfer\n\nTry again:\n\nInitial: 3,000,000.00  \n+All cash sales: 5,519,928.55  \n+Bank to cash transfer: 1,600,000.00  \n- All purchases paid by cash: 6,530,000.00  \n- All expenses paid by cash: 2,506,095.59  \n- All cash to bank transfer: 3,700,000.00  \n\nSum:\n\nStart: 3,000,000.00  \n+5,519,928.55=8,519,928.55  \n+1,600,000.00=10,119,928.55  \n\nTotal inflow:10,119,928.55\n\nTotal outflow:\n6,530,000.00  \n+2,506,095.59=9,036,095.59  \n+3,700,000.00=12,736,095.59\n\n`Cash End = 10,119,928.55 - 12,736,095.59`\n`= -2,616,167.04`\n\n**Impossible; must be over-counting bank to cash/cash to bank transfers.**\nLet’s try to only take NET bank/cash movement:\n\nTotal \"Bank to cash transfer\": **1,600,000.00** (see above)  \nTotal \"Cash to bank transfer\": **3,700,000.00** (see above)  \nNet transfer = 1,600,000.00 - 3,700,000.00 = **-2,100,000.00**  \nWhich is a net outflow from cash to bank.\n\nSo, perhaps the calculation should be:\n\nInitial cash: 3,000,000.00\n+ cash sales: 5,519,928.55\n+ net bank/cash transfer: -2,100,000.00\n- cash purchases: 6,530,000.00\n- cash expenses: 2,506,095.59\n\nCompute:\n\nStart: 3,000,000.00  \n+5,519,928.55=8,519,928.55  \n-2,100,000.00=6,419,928.55  \n\nSubtract:\n-6,530,000.00= (6,419,928.55 - 6,530,000.00) = -110,071.45  \n-2,506,095.59= -2,616,167.04\n\nNow, negative again. But in the example, the cash on hand *does* drop below initial (from 3M to 270K), indicating massive outflows.\n\nWait: could the problem be that we're including both cash to bank and bank to cash, but shouldn't be since almost every transfer is paired (i.e., for every bank to cash, there will be a cash to bank).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the provided example, the solution only included:\n- Initial Cash\n- + cash sales (i.e., *only* sales received as cash)\n- - cash payments (purchases, expenses paid in cash)\n- - cash sent to bank\n\nBut, cash received from bank should absolutely be added.\n\nLooking closer at the example, let's relate our calculation to theirs. In the example (see first message above), the initial cash is 3,000,000, and after a comparable number of transactions, final cash is about 270,000.\n\nThus, let's try to recompute using ONLY inflows (cash sales + bank to cash), minus outflows (cash purchases + cash expenses + cash to bank transfer).\n\nHere is an error: earlier, in my outflows, on the purchases paid by cash, I included 2,900,000.0 (Purchase20231231004), but let's confirm from the data if purchases ever are paid by both cash and bank transfer, and only pick actual cash.\n\n- Purchase20231231003: Amount: 300,000 | Paid | Cash\n- Purchase20231231004: 2,900,000 | Paid | Cash |\n- Purchase20231231005: 1,050,000 | Paid | Cash |\n- Purchase20231231006: 220,000 | Paid | Cash |\n- Purchase20231231008: 1,800,000 | Paid | Cash |\n- Purchase20231231009: 260,000 | Paid | Cash |\n- Purchase20231231011: 260,000 | Paid | Cash |\n\nWait: I missed Purchase20231231011 above, but upon review, it's 260,000.\n\nBut in the data, Purchase20231231011 is 260,000? Checking:  \n| Purchase20231231011 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 260,000.0 | 260,000.0 | Director | Senior Staff | Paid | Cash | 10,000.0 | S010 | Supplier 10 | P001 | Chemical Product A | 26.0 | 10,000.0 |\n\nSo total purchases in cash:\n300,000.00  \n2,900,000.00 =3,200,000.00  \n1,050,000.00=4,250,000.00  \n220,000.00=4,470,000.00  \n1,800,000.00=6,270,000.00  \n260,000.00=6,530,000.00  \n260,000.00=6,790,000.00\n\nIt seems 260,000 is double, check the ids:\n- Purchase20231231009| Paid | Cash | 260,000.0\n- Purchase20231231011| Paid | Cash | 260,000.0\n\nBoth are different purchases.\n\nSo, correct total is 6,790,000.00 in purchases paid by cash.\n\nNow, let's check total:\n\n#### All inflows:\n- Initial cash: 3,000,000.00\n- Cash sales: 5,519,928.55\n- Bank to cash: 1,600,000.00\n\n**Total cash in: 10,119,928.55**\n\n#### All outflows:\n- Cash purchases: 6,790,000.00\n- Cash expenses: 2,506,095.59\n- Cash to bank transfers: 3,700,000.00\n\n**Total out: 13,006,095.59**\n\nSo,\n\n`10,119,928.55 - 13,006,095.59 = -2,886,167.04`\n\nNegative, but in the reference example, numbers fell to less than initial (i.e., to 270,000), but not negative!\n\nIs the error in my transfers? Let's revisit the transfer counts, because it's likely that *some* transfer rows are double in the data (the example shows that each transfer row is listed more than once for the same transfer). Let's check the raw data per transfer date.\n\ne.g., Transfer20240110001 (2024-01-10): occurs 6 times × 100,000 = 600,000 — that's 6 cash-to-bank transfers in one day, is that possible? Or is it just 1?\n\nOn examining the original data example, it's evident that for each \"Transfer\", the transfer is often listed multiple times (possibly for both debit and credit in the journal). To avoid double-counting, only sum each unique Transfer ID ONCE per date.\n\nLet's redo the transfer outflow:\n\nList all transfer transactions with \"Cash to bank transfer\" in the description, and sum only ONCE per unique id.\n\nLooking back:\n- Transfer20240110001 | Cash to bank transfer | 2024-01-10: appears 6 times with amount 100,000.0\n- Transfer20240111001 | Cash to bank transfer | 2024-01-11: appears 5 times with 100,000\n- Transfer20240112001 | Cash to bank transfer | 2024-01-12: appears 6 times with 100,000\n- Transfer20240124001 | Cash to bank transfer | appears 1 time with 100,000.0\n- Transfer20240125001 | Cash to bank transfer | appears 2 times with 100,000.0\n- Transfer20240127001 | Cash to bank transfer | appears 4 times with 100,000.0\n- Transfer20240128001 | Cash to bank transfer | appears 6 times with 100,000.0\n- Transfer20240129001 | Cash to bank transfer | appears 7 times with 100,000.0\n\nTherefore, the actual cash to bank transfers are:\n- 2024-01-10: 100,000.0\n- 2024-01-11: 100,000.0\n- 2024-01-12: 100,000.0\n- 2024-01-24: 100,000.0\n- 2024-01-25: 100,000.0\n- 2024-01-27: 100,000.0\n- 2024-01-28: 100,000.0\n- 2024-01-29: 100,000.0\n\nSum: 100,000 × 8 = **800,000.0**\n\nNow, do the same for \"Bank to cash transfer\" (inflows):\n\n- Transfer20240104001 (2024-01-04): appears 4 times. Only count once: 100,000.0  \n- Transfer20240105001 (2024-01-05): 1 time: 100,000.0  \n- Transfer20240106001 (2024-01-06): 1 time: 100,000.0  \n- Transfer20240115001 (2024-01-15): 1 time: 100,000.0  \n\nTotal: 100,000 × 4 = **400,000.0** inflow from bank-to-cash\n\nSo, the correct net bank/cash transfer is:\nBank to cash: 400,000.0  \nCash to bank: 800,000.0  \nNet transfer: 400,000.0 - 800,000.0 = **-400,000.0**  \n\nNow, recalculate with these adjustments.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Final Calculation**\n- Initial cash: 3,000,000.00\n- + ALL cash sales: 5,519,928.55\n- + net bank-cash transfer: -400,000.0 (i.e., 400,000 more left cash than entered)\n- - purchases paid in cash: 6,790,000.0\n- - expenses paid in cash: 2,506,095.59\n\nSum up:\n\nStart: 3,000,000.00\n+ 5,519,928.55 = 8,519,928.55\n- 400,000.00 = 8,119,928.55\n\nSubtract purchases: - 6,790,000.00 = 1,329,928.55\n\nSubtract expenses: - 2,506,095.59 = **-1,176,167.04** (still negative; must double check reasoning.)\n\nBut in the example, they matched cash in- and out-flows with initial cash, cash sales, cash paid for expenses and purchases, and one count for each transfer.\n\nThus, to summarize:\n\n### 6. **Check Calculation Against The Example Provided**\nIn your example, the cash end was 270,005.90, with similar transactions.\n\nIf the total number of cash to bank or bank to cash transfer is 100,000 per unique id (regardless of repeats), then only the first occurrence per id should be counted.\n\nSo, counting each unique ID for cash to bank and bank to cash transfer:\n\nCheck your data for:\n- Unique \"Bank to cash transfer\" ids (Transfer2024010...), total inflow: list all unique, sum once per id.\n- Unique \"Cash to bank transfer\" ids, same.\n\n### a. List Unique Bank to Cash Transfers:\n- Transfer20240104001\n- Transfer20240105001\n- Transfer20240106001\n- Transfer20240115001\n\n= 4 × 100,000 = 400,000.0\n\n### b. List Unique Cash to Bank Transfers:\n- Transfer20240110001\n- Transfer20240111001\n- Transfer20240112001\n- Transfer20240124001\n- Transfer20240125001\n- Transfer20240127001\n- Transfer20240128001\n- Transfer20240129001\n- Transfer20240130001\n\n= 9 × 100,000 = 900,000.0\n\nNet: 400,000 - 900,000 = -500,000\n\nSo, net 500,000.0 moved from cash to bank during the period.\n\nNow, let's try one more time.\n\n---\n\n**Final Tally:**\n\nStart: 3,000,000.00  \n+ cash sales: 5,519,928.55  \n+ net transfer: -500,000.0 (total bank to cash less cash to bank transfers — only one per unique id)  \n- purchases paid in cash: 6,790,000.0  \n- expenses paid in cash: 2,506,095.59  \n\nStep by step: \n\nStart: 3,000,000.00  \n+5,519,928.55=8,519,928.55  \n-500,000.0=8,019,928.55  \n-6,790,000.0=1,229,928.55  \n-2,506,095.59 =**-1,276,167.04** (again, negative)\n\nBut the total outflow exceeds cash in, yet the example ended with a positive value, indicating a possible error in the purchase or sales sums.\n\nLet’s ensure the purchases paid in cash are not being double-counted or are correct.\n\nCheck the purchases:\n\n| ID | Amount |  \n| -- | ------ |  \n| Purchase20231231003 | 300,000.00 |  \n| Purchase20231231004 | 2,900,000.00 |  \n| Purchase20231231005 | 1,050,000.00 |  \n| Purchase20231231006 | 220,000.00 |  \n| Purchase20231231008 | 1,800,000.00 |  \n| Purchase20231231009 | 260,000.00 |  \n| Purchase20231231011 | 260,000.00 |  \n\nSum:  \n300,000  \n+2,900,000  \n=3,200,000  \n+1,050,000=4,250,000  \n+220,000=4,470,000  \n+1,800,000=6,270,000  \n+260,000=6,530,000  \n+260,000=6,790,000  \n\nIf the purchases paid in cash total 6,790,000, that's correct.\n\nIn the example, similar cash purchases were present and the end value was around 270,000, not negative.\n\nAlso, it's possible that not all purchases tagged as \"Paid | Cash\" are truly cash out; perhaps some also counted in expense lines.\n\n**But with the given instructions, and using only the initial cash, cash receipts, cash purchases, cash expenses, and net cash transfer, the formula aligns with accounting standards.**\n\n---\n\n## **Summary and Final Solution**\n**Cash on Hand Initial Value:** 3,000,000.00  \n**Cash on Hand End Value:** -1,276,167.04\n\nBut since a negative cash balance is not realistic (unless overdraft), we may have undercounted cash receipts, or failed to include other incoming cash flows (such as interest received in cash). However, all the \"Interest Receivable\" seem to be unpaid.\n\n**Thus, given the data, using only the transactions explicitly labeled,**  \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\",\n  \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"-1276167.04\"\n}}\n```\n\nHowever, since a negative ending balance is not practical, it suggests in reality that either:\n- Some inflow is missing/not labeled as \"Cash\"\n- Some payments assumed as cash were actually from bank or were not paid\n- Or double-counting occurs somewhere.\n\nFor the purpose of this task, following the instructions, that is the technical result. If a positive balance is expected (as in the sample, similar in scale), then some purchases labeled paid by cash should instead not be included, or cash-to-bank should be included only once per real-world transfer.\n\n**If you provide more clarification on transfers, or want only one occurrence per transfer id, then the calculation above is correct.**\n\n## **Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\", \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"-1276167.04\"}}\n```",
