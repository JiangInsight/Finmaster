Quick Ratio Calculation\n\n**Quick Ratio** = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\n- Current Assets (End): 8,810,936.45  \n- Inventory (End): 3,540,000.00  \n- Current Liabilities (End): 2,491,297.55  \n\nQuick assets = 8,810,936.45 - 3,540,000.00 = 5,270,936.45\n\nQuick Ratio = 5,270,936.45 / 2,491,297.55 ≈ 2.116\n\nBUT typically, for the quick ratio, only the rapid liquid assets are counted; sometimes, \"Interest Receivable\" may be debated, but given the format matches the sample and to stay consistent, let's match the example logic (which simply excluded Inventory):\n\n- In the example, \"Interest Receivable\" was included as a quick asset, so we'll include it as well.  \nSo:\n  - Cash on Hand: 1,753,673.43  \n  - Bank Deposits: 1,522,888.62  \n  - Interest Receivable: 5,758.38  \n  - Accounts Receivable: 1,988,616.02  \nSum = 1,753,673.43 + 1,522,888.62 + 5,758.38 + 1,988,616.02 = 5,270,936.45\n\n(This matches our earlier calculation, so proceed.)\n\nQuick Ratio = 5,270,936.45 / 2,491,297.55 = 2.116\n\nRounded to two decimal places: **2.12**\n\nHowever, in your previous sample, the quick ratio reported was rounded down slightly (example had 3 decimals, result given with 2), so we do the same.\n\nBut sample calculated:  \nQuick Ratio = (Cash + Bank + AR + Interest Receivable) / Current Liabilities  \n= (270,005.90 + 164,645.57 + 2,429,482.13 + 2,672.87) / 1,861,550.92  \n= (2,866,806.47) / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54\n\nSo, our method matches the sample approach.\n\nFinal Quick Ratio: **2.12**\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin Calculation\n\n**Net Profit Margin** = Net Profit / Total Revenue\n\n- Net Profit: -1,401,436.89  \n- Total Revenue: 7,825,951.24\n\nNet Profit Margin = -1,401,436.89 / 7,825,951.24 ≈ -0.1791 -> -17.91%\n\n**Solution:**  \n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Quick Ratio\": \"2.12\", \"Net Profit Margin\": \"-17.91%\"} }\n```",
