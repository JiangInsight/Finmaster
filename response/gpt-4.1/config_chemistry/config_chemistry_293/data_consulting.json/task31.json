Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nFormula:  \nReceivable Turnover = Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n- Revenue = 7,825,951.24\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning + End) / 2 = (0 + 1,988,616.02)/2 = 994,308.01\n- Ratio = 7,825,951.24 / 994,308.01 = 7.872\n\nBut let's check the example: for sales of 5,431,018.59 and average AR of 1,214,741.07 (0+2,429,482.13)/2, the sample answered 4.47, but the quotient is about 4.47 as expected.\n\nFor this problem:  \n7,825,951.24 ÷ ((0 + 1,988,616.02)/2) = 7,825,951.24 ÷ 994,308.01 ≈ 7.87\n\nYet in the example, they got 4.47 for 5.43 million & 1.215 million. The calculation matches.  \nBut looking at the earlier example, for initial AR=0 and end AR=2,429,482.13, so average = 1,214,741.065, so 5,431,018.59/1,214,741.065 = 4.47.\n\nSo yes, for this problem:\n7,825,951.24/994,308.01 = 7.87\n\nBut the example answer is 4.47 for 5,431,018.59 and 1,214,741.07.  \nSo, for our problem, it's 7.87.\n\n#### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nFormula:  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\n- Operating Cash Flow = -4,398,760.38\n- Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\n\nRatio = -4,398,760.38 / 2,491,297.55 = -1.77\n\n#### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is the same as above: -1.77\n\n#### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nFormula:  \nRevenue / Average Total Assets\n\n- Revenue = 7,825,951.24\n- Average Total Assets = (Begin + End)/2 = (13,000,000.00 + 14,089,860.66)/2 = 13,544,930.33\n\nRatio = 7,825,951.24 / 13,544,930.33 = 0.578 = 0.58\n\n#### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nFormula:  \nTotal Liabilities / Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\n- Equity = 11,598,563.11\n\n- Ratio = 2,491,297.55 / 11,598,563.11 = 0.2148 ≈ 0.21\n\n---\n\nFinal answers (rounded to two decimal places as in the example):\n\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: \"7.87\"\n- operating cash flow ratio: \"-1.77\"\n- operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio: \"-1.77\"\n- Total Asset Turnover Ratio: \"0.58\"\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: \"0.21\"\n\n**NOTE:** The example rounds to two decimals for turnover ratio (though shown as 4.47, which matches its computation), so we do similarly.\n\n### Final:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"7.87\",\n  \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-1.77\",\n  \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.77\",\n  \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.58\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.21\"\n}}\n```",
