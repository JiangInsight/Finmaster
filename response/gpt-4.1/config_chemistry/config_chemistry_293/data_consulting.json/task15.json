To be consistent and a bit more precise, let's round to two decimals:**\n\n   - 0.93\n\n**If we round to two decimals:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.93\"} }\n```\n\n**If further accuracy in the context is required, keeping two decimal places is standard as in the example. So the answer is 0.93.**",
