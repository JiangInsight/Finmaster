Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\nFormula:  \nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = |Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities| / |Net Profit|\n\nNumbers:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -4,398,760.38\n- Net Profit: -1,401,436.89\n\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{4,398,760.38}{1,401,436.89} = 3.14\n$$\n\n#### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\nFormula:  \nCurrent Assets Turnover = Total Revenue / Average Current Assets\n\nNumbers:\n- Total Revenue: 7,825,951.24\n- Current Assets at Start: 8,000,000.00\n- Current Assets at End: 8,810,936.45\n- Average Current Assets = (8,000,000.00 + 8,810,936.45) / 2 = 8,405,468.22\n\n$$\n\\text{Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{7,825,951.24}{8,405,468.22} = 0.93\n$$\n\nBut typically, income statement items are compared to average, so:\n- Current Assets Turnover Ratio = 0.93 (rounded to 2 decimals: 0.93)\n\nHowever, based on the example provided, only end period value was used, not average. So let's check:\n- Using end-of-period: 7,825,951.24 / 8,810,936.45 = 0.89\n\n> **Following the example, the answer should be 0.89**\n\n#### 3. Quick Ratio\nFormula:  \nQuick Ratio = (Cash + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n\nNumbers at 2024-01-30:\n- Cash: 1,753,673.43\n- Bank Deposits: 1,522,888.62\n- Accounts Receivable: 1,988,616.02\n- Interest Receivable: 5,758.38\n- Current Liabilities: 2,491,297.55\n\nSum:\n1,753,673.43 + 1,522,888.62 + 1,988,616.02 + 5,758.38 = 5,270,936.45\n\nQuick Ratio = 5,270,936.45 / 2,491,297.55 = 2.12\n\nBut, per strict definition, inventory is excluded but all other current assets that can be converted quickly are included, so calculation above is correct.\n\nHowever, in the example, Cash + Bank + Receivables was used (Interest Receivable included). In the example, quick ratio was 1.54 from (270,005.90 + 164,645.57 + 2,429,482.13 + 2,672.87) / 1,861,550.92 = 2,866,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 = 1.54\n\nSo our result:\n5,270,936.45 / 2,491,297.55 = 2.12\n\nBut the example likely excluded Interest Receivable? Noâ€”they included it.\n\nAlternatively, if only Cash, Bank, Accounts Receivable (without Interest Receivable):\n1,753,673.43 + 1,522,888.62 + 1,988,616.02 = 5,265,178.07\n5,265,178.07 / 2,491,297.55 = 2.11\n\nThe difference is minor due to Interest Receivable size.\n\n**However, the example likely did not exclude prepayment, which is missing here.**\n\nBut, for your case, the most consistent answer (using all non-inventory current assets):\n\n**Quick Ratio = (Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable) / Current Liabilities = 5,270,936.45 / 2,491,297.55 = 2.12**\n\nBut in the example, they didn't use the calculated result exactly, possibly rounding down for margin of safety. Nevertheless, the correct answer as per calculation is 2.12, but rounded to 2 decimal places. If the \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\" is 0.89 as in the example style (using only end-of-period), that's the answer.\n\nSo, the final answers:\n- Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: 3.14\n- Current Assets Turnover Ratio: 0.89\n- Quick Ratio: 2.12\n\nBut since the example reported to 2 decimal places and used slightly different (more conservative) numbers, if you prefer rounding down as done in your example, you might use 1.50, but per calculation, it is 2.12.\n\nGiven all the above and for consistency with the apparent calculation style in the example, let's use:\n\nQuick Ratio = (1,753,673.43 + 1,522,888.62 + 1,988,616.02 + 5,758.38) / 2,491,297.55 = 2.12\n\nThus,\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '3.14', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.89', 'Quick Ratio': '2.12'} }\n```",
