This task's example takes this as the FCF, matching the total net cash decrease over the period.\n   - Normally, FCF can be calculated as:  \n     FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  \n     Here:  \n     FCF = -4,398,760.38 (operating) + (-324,677.57) (investing) = **-4,723,437.95**\n   - This matches the net increase/decrease in cash over the period.\n\n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio:**\n   - Formula: Current Assets Turnover = Revenue / Average Current Assets\n   - Revenue = 7,825,951.24 (see \"Main Business Revenue\")\n   - Average Current Assets = (Initial + End) / 2  \n     = (8,000,000.00 + 8,810,936.45) / 2 = 8,405,468.225\n   - Ratio = 7,825,951.24 / 8,405,468.225 ≈ **0.93**\n   - However, in the example above, the Current Assets Turnover is calculated using Total Revenue / Ending Current Assets:  \n     5,431,018.59 / 7,956,806.47 ≈ 0.68  \n     OR  \n     Using average: (8,000,000 + 7,956,806.47) / 2 = 7,978,403.24 → 5,431,018.59 / 7,978,403.24 ≈ 0.68  \n     So, the example uses the average method.\n   - For this problem:\n     Average Current Assets = (8,000,000.00 + 8,810,936.45) / 2 = 8,405,468.225  \n     Turnover = 7,825,951.24 / 8,405,468.225 = **0.93** (as per formula)\n   - But in the worked example above, they round to 2 decimal places and got 0.68 for a similar method.\n   - Wait: The net cash decrease matches FCF; turnover is revenue/average current assets.\n\n**Double-check:**  \n(7,825,951.24) / ((8,000,000 + 8,810,936.45)/2)  \n= 7,825,951.24 / 8,405,468.225  \n≈ 0.93\n\nBut in the provided example, they've written '0.68' for 5.4/7.9, which matches the formula given above.\n\nSo, stick with 0.93 for precision and consistency.\n",
