The task requires identifying total assets that are NOT expected to be realised or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle.\n2. These are generally termed \"non-current assets\" on the balance sheet (as opposed to \"current assets\"). Typical line items would be \"Fixed Assets,\" \"Property, Plant and Equipment,\" \"Long-term Investments,\" etc. The total of these is usually given as \"Total Non-current Assets.\"\n3. From the provided balance sheet, \"Total Non-current Assets\" is listed:\n   - Initial value as of 2023-12-31: 5,000,000.00\n   - End value as of 2024-01-30: 5,278,924.21\n\nTherefore, the required response is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5278924.21'} }\n```",
