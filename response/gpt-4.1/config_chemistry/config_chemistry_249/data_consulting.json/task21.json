Free Cash Flow (FCF):\n\nIn your example, the FCF is matched directly to the \"Net Increase\" in Cash and Cash Equivalents from the cash flow statement (i.e., Ending Balance - Beginning Balance), or often calculated as:\n\nFCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -6,856,840.58\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -666,078.18\n\nSum:  \n-6,856,840.58 + (-666,078.18) = -7,522,918.76\n\nThis matches the \"Net Increase\" line in the cash flow.\n\nSo,  \n**FCF = -7,522,918.76**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\nFormula:  \nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Average Current Assets\n\n- Revenue = \"Main Business Revenue\" = 6,836,701.10\n\nAverage Current Assets = (Beginning Current Assets + Ending Current Assets) / 2  \n= (8,000,000.00 + 7,000,260.27) / 2  \n= 15,000,260.27 / 2  \n= 7,500,130.135\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = 6,836,701.10 / 7,500,130.135 ≈ 0.91\n\nHowever, from your example, you are using the formula:  \nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Average Current Assets  \nSo let's check the calculation one more time:\n\nCalculation:  \n6,836,701.10 ÷ 7,500,130.135 = **0.91** (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nHowever, in the example, they rounded to two decimal places as 0.68 (which matches 5431018.59 / (8000000 + 7956806.47)/2 ).  \nWith the above numbers, **0.91** is the correct value.\n\nBut let's check if the ending figure might be used instead (some definitions use ending current assets):\n\nIf using ending current assets:  \nCurrent Assets Turnover = Revenue / Ending Current Assets  \n= 6,836,701.10 / 7,000,260.27 ≈ 0.98\n\nYour example used the average:  \nMain Business Revenue: 5,431,018.59  \nAvg. Current Assets: (8,000,000.00 + 7,956,806.47)/2 = 7,978,403.235  \nResult: 5,431,018.59 / 7,978,403.235 = **0.68**\n\nThus, the method uses average. The numbers above correspond with my previous sum.\n\nBut let's check the math again:\n\nAverage Current Assets:  \n= (8,000,000.00 + 7,000,260.27) / 2  \n= 7,500,130.135\n\n6,836,701.10 / 7,500,130.135 = 0.911\n\nRounded to two decimal places: 0.91\n\nBut if the example output is as per example, perhaps you want one decimal after the dot? Example input: 0.68, which is two decimals.\n\nSo, **final answers**:\n- FCF: -7,522,918.76\n- Current Assets Turnover Ratio: 0.91\n\nBut if you prefer ending amount (which sometimes is used), the ratio would be 0.98.\n\nBased purely on the approach in your example (using average), the answer is:\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-7522918.76\", \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.91\"} }\n```\n\nIf you are matching the ending balance approach:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-7522918.76\", \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.98\"} }\n```\n\n**But the standard method is average, so the first answer is preferred.**",
