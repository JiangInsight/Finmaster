Current Ratio\n- **Formula:**  \n  Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\n- **Data from Balance Sheet (2024-02-01):**  \n  - Total Current Assets = 7,000,260.27  \n  - Total Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n    7,000,260.27 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ 4.37\n\n### 2. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n- **Formula:**  \n  Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\n- **Data:**\n  - Cost of Goods Sold = 5,700,000.00 (Income Statement)\n  - Inventory at Beginning (2023-12-31) = 0.00\n  - Inventory at End (2024-02-01) = 3,420,000.00\n\n- **Average Inventory:**  \n    (0.00 + 3,420,000.00) / 2 = 1,710,000.00\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n    5,700,000.00 / 1,710,000.00 ≈ 3.33\n\nBut, to be consistent with the example, where Beginning Inventory was zero, the calculation was:\n- (\"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": Cost of Goods Sold / Ending Inventory)\n\nIn the example:\n4410000 / 5090000 = 0.87, but the result given was 1.73, which is Cost of Goods Sold / (Ending Inventory/2), i.e.  \n4410000 / (5090000/2) = 4410000 / 2545000 ≈ 1.73\n\nSo:\nFor this problem:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 5,700,000.00\n- Ending Inventory = 3,420,000.00\n\nSo, divide by half the Ending Inventory as per the template:\n5,700,000.00 / (3,420,000.00 / 2) = 5,700,000.00 / 1,710,000.00 ≈ 3.33\n\nBut the example and formula suggest the answer should be:\nInventory Turnover Ratio = COGS / (Ending Inventory / 2)\n\nTherefore, answer should be **3.33**.\n\nHowever, in the example, they reported 1.73 (with COGS 4,410,000 and Ending Inventory 5,090,000).  \n4,410,000 / (5,090,000 / 2) = 1.73, so the formula is correct.\n\nThus, for this task:\n5,700,000 / (3,420,000 / 2) = 5,700,000 / 1,710,000 = **3.33**\n\n**But the AI earlier wrote Inventory Turnover as 1.90. Let's double-check:**\nIf we use average inventory (i.e., (0 + 3,420,000)/2 = 1,710,000), the ratio is 3.33.\n\nBut **if we use only Ending Inventory**, as sometimes it is used in certain situations with zero beginning inventory, then:\n5,700,000 / 3,420,000 = 1.67.\n\n**But the template clearly divided by HALF the ending inventory**, so the previous answer of 1.90 was probably just a typo in a different scenario.\n\n### **Final Answers:**\n\n- **Current Ratio:** 4.37\n- **Inventory Turnover Ratio:** 3.33\n\n**Summing up:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Current Ratio\": \"4.37\", \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"3.33\"}}\n```",
