Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n= Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n- Revenue = 6,836,701.10  \n- Beginning AR = 0.00  \n- Ending AR = 3,098,023.69  \n- Average AR = (0 + 3,098,023.69) / 2 = 1,549,011.85  \n- Ratio = 6,836,701.10 / 1,549,011.85 ≈ **4.41**\n\nBut the business started with no AR (so all sales are credit sales, and it may make sense to use only ending AR), but by previous example, average is used.\n\nHowever, last time they used:  \nRevenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n- In your precedent, for revenue 5,431,018.59 and average AR (0 + 2,429,482.13)/2 = 1,214,741.07 → Ratio: 5,431,018.59/1,214,741.07 = 4.47.  \nHere:  \n6,836,701.10 / 1,549,011.85 = **4.41**\n\nBut you put 2.46? That looks inconsistent.\n\nWait, in the structure, perhaps they're using Ending AR?  \nUsing ending only: 6,836,701.10 / 3,098,023.69 = **2.21**\n\nBut in the example, 5,431,018.59/2,429,482.13 = 2.24.\n\nBut the value reported in the example is 4.47, which is with average AR.\n\nTherefore, I will use:  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Average AR  \n= 6,836,701.10 / 1,549,011.85 ≈ **4.41**\n\nBut you put 2.46 in your solution reasoning; that's probably a mistake. Let's adhere to the template and rules from the example.\n\n#### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio / Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n= Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n- OCF = -6,856,840.58  \n- Current Liabilities (End) = 1,601,835.08  \nRatio = -6,856,840.58 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ **-4.28**\n\n#### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n= Revenue / Average Total Assets  \n- Revenue = 6,836,701.10  \n- Average Total Assets: (13,000,000.00 + 12,566,098.56)/2 = 12,783,049.28  \nRatio = 6,836,701.10 / 12,783,049.28 ≈ **0.54**\n\n#### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n= Total Liabilities / Owner's Equity  \n- Total Liabilities = Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08  \n- Total Equity = 10,964,263.48  \nRatio = 1,601,835.08 / 10,964,263.48 ≈ **0.146 ≈ 0.15**\n\nFilling in (with corrected AR turnover):\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"4.41\",\n  \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-4.28\",\n  \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-4.28\",\n  \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.54\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.15\"\n}}\n```\n**This is the accurate result with explicit calculation steps.**",
