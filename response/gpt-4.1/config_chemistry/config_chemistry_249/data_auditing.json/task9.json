I searched for any internal discrepancies in the numeric calculations (e.g., amount ≠ unit price × quantity), status/payment method/receive method misalignments, or mis-categorizations.\n\nI found **no critical inconsistencies** across the fields when comparing the recorded values to what the invoice states, **except those already highlighted in the risk_issues column**, which you have already noted, such as:\n\n- For `Sale20240108014`, there is an inconsistency in the tax_amount value (recorded: 246948.27, actual per invoice/unit price × quantity × standard tax seems to be 12565.31). \n- For `Sale20240130054`, the recorded tax_amount is 134717.5, but the correct should be 6113.34 as per the calculation and invoice.\n\nAll other rows appear properly reconciled between their recorded fields and their invoice description for quantity, unit price, amount, payment status, methods, etc.\n\nThus, **no new inconsistencies** were present beyond those already documented, and the solution reflects this by marking all fields as null and id as null.\n\nIf you want me to output the previously highlighted problems (those under risk_issues), for completeness, here they are (as you asked for per problem):\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Original category\": null,\n  \"Recorded category\": null,\n  \"Original date\": null,\n  \"Recorded date\": null,\n  \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null,\n  \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null,\n  \"Original payment_method\": null,\n  \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n  \"Original quantity\": null,\n  \"Recorded quantity\": null,\n  \"Original price\": null,\n  \"Recorded price\": null,\n  \"Original receive_method\": null,\n  \"Recorded receive_method\": null,\n  \"Original amount\": null,\n  \"Recorded amount\": null,\n  \"Original tax\": \"12565.31\",\n  \"Recorded tax\": \"246948.27\",\n  \"Original profit\": null,\n  \"Recorded profit\": null,\n  \"Original Preparer\": null,\n  \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n  \"Original Approver\": null,\n  \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n  \"id\": \"Sale20240108014\"\n}}\n```\nand\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Original category\": null,\n  \"Recorded category\": null,\n  \"Original date\": null,\n  \"Recorded date\": null,\n  \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null,\n  \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null,\n  \"Original payment_method\": null,\n  \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n  \"Original quantity\": null,\n  \"Recorded quantity\": null,\n  \"Original price\": null,\n  \"Recorded price\": null,\n  \"Original receive_method\": null,\n  \"Recorded receive_method\": null,\n  \"Original amount\": null,\n  \"Recorded amount\": null,\n  \"Original tax\": \"6113.34\",\n  \"Recorded tax\": \"134717.5\",\n  \"Original profit\": null,\n  \"Recorded profit\": null,\n  \"Original Preparer\": null,\n  \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n  \"Original Approver\": null,\n  \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n  \"id\": \"Sale20240130054\"\n}}\n```\n\n**Summary:** Except for the already highlighted tax field inconsistencies in the two sales rows mentioned, there are no further errors or inconsistencies.
