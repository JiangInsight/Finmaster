Sale20240110014:\n- From the invoice: \"On January 10, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $112853.06, totaling $225,706.12. The cost amount...tax...\"\n- **Recorded date** is 2024-01-11 (should be 2024-01-10 per invoice).\n- **Recorded amount** is 241310.10 (should be 225706.12 according to calculation: 2.0 Ã— 112,853.06 = 225,706.12).\n- All else (category/type, payment/receipt status, method, quantity, price, etc.) are consistent.\n\n### 2. Interest20240114014:\n- Invoice: \"On January 14, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Interest Receivables, totaling $16.43. The receive_method... and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n- **Recorded amount** is 157.22, but invoice says 16.43.\n- **date** is correctly recorded as 2024-01-14.\n- All else matches.\n\nIf you need further breakdown for more issues, let me know: these are the internal inconsistencies visible in the provided excerpt.",
