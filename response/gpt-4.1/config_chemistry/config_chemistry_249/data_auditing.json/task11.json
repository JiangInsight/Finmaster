Additional rows for \"Bank deposit\" and \"Fixed Assets\" for the same id with $5,000,000 are inconsistent. There should only be the original row.\n- **Rows with missing preparer**: For example, in `Expense20240105001` with $16,864.59 and in `Expense20240125001` with $19,122.72, the invoice confirms that the transaction was prepared by Staff, but the `recorded_preparer` field is blank/None. These should be corrected to \"Staff\".\n- **All other fields with calculated columns** (e.g., `recorded_amount` = `recorded_quantity` Ã— `recorded_unit_price`), and metadata fields (approver, payment method, status, etc.) match the description in the invoices and do not show inconsistent data beyond the above rows.\n\n**Note:** The output is provided as a list for clarity, but you can present each object individually as per your reporting needs. The task mainly required you to detect and present the field and value differences for each unique id/row where the invoice or deduction makes clear that the recorded data is wrong.",
