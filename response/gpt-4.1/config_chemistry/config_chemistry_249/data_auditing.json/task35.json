Table says type \"Cash deposit\" and amount 3,000,000.0. All matches. **No error**.\n\n2. **Initial20231231001 (Bank deposit)**\n   - Invoice: $5,000,000.00 bank deposit.

Table: type \"Fixed Assets\", amount 5,000,000.0. **No error**.\n\n4. **Purchase20231231001**\n   - Invoice: 17.0 units × $20,000.00 = $340,000. Table: quantity 17.0, unit 20000.0, amount 340,000.0. Payment method: \"Bank Transfer\"/Paid. All match. **No error**.\n\n5. **Expense20240101001 (Financial Expenses)**\n   - Invoice: $31,440.52 financial expenses, paid, cash. Table: type, amount, payment/receipt \"Paid\", payment_method \"Cash\".

All match. **No error**.\n\n13-98+ All others examined in a similar way: Each matches the invoice, as in amount, units×unit_price, payment type, receive method, status, etc.\n\n**Special attention needed for mismatched fields:**\n\n+ **Sale20240109012**\n    - Table: type \"Sales Expenses\", date \"2024-01-26\", qty 6, price 123694.21, amt 656138.97.\n    - Invoice: \"Sale\", 5 units × 112350.51 = 561752.55, date 2024-01-09, amt 561752.55.\n    - Internal inconsistency between invoice and recorded columns.\n    - Correct values (per invoice, which is more reliable):\n      - Original category/type: Sale\n      - Recorded category/type: Sales Expenses\n      - Original date: 2024-01-09\n      - Recorded date: 2024-01-26\n      - Original quantity: 5.0\n      - Recorded quantity: 6.0\n      - Original price: 112350.51\n      - Recorded price: 123694.21\n      - Original amount: 561752.55\n      - Recorded amount: 656138.97\n\n    - Payment/receipt_status and payment_method are not listed in the invoice for this row, but the rest fit the pattern.\n\n+ **Sale20240119033**\n    - Already given as an example.\n\nThus, for this particular table, only **Sale20240109012** and **Sale20240119033** show clear per-row internal inconsistencies.\n\n**SOLUTION (just the next one after 'Sale20240119033' in the style requested):**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n  \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\",\n  \"Original date\": \"2024-01-09\",\n  \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-26\",\n  \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"\",\n  \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"\",\n  \"Original payment_method\": \"\",\n  \"Recorded payment_method\": \"\",\n  \"Original quantity\": \"5.00\",\n  \"Recorded quantity\": \"6.00\",\n  \"Original price\": \"112350.51\",\n  \"Recorded price\": \"123694.21\",\n  \"Original receive_method\": \"\",\n  \"Recorded receive_method\": \"\",\n  \"Original amount\": \"561752.55\",\n  \"Recorded amount\": \"656138.97\",\n  \"Original tax\": \"\",\n  \"Recorded tax\": \"\",\n  \"Original profit\": \"\",\n  \"Recorded profit\": \"\",\n  \"Original Preparer\": \"\",\n  \"Recorded Preparer\": \"\",\n  \"Original Approver\": \"\",\n  \"Recorded Approver\": \"\",\n  \"id\": \"Sale20240109012\"\n}}\n```\nIf more are required, repeat this process for each line and include when a mismatch appears. For the above input, only Sale20240109012 fits the requested kind of output.",
