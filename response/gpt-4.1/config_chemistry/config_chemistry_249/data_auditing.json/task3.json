Each row is checked for mismatches.\n- The row for id `Sale20240126048` is a Sale, but according to the invoice:  \n  \"... The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"  \n  But in the table: \n  - `recorded_payment/receipt_status` is \"Paid\" (should be \"Unpaid\").\n  - All other relevant fields (amount, receive_method, etc.) match the invoice.\n- All other rows in the provided data either match or do not show contradictory information between the invoice text and the 'recorded_' fields (other than the previously solved Interest20240121021).\n- Only Sale20240126048 is a new internal inconsistency.\n\nIf you need all inconsistencies, including both previous and new, let me know; otherwise this JSON is the answer for the given table.",
