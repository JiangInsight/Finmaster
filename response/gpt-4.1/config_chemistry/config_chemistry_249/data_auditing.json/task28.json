According to the invoice text (\"invoice was issued for a Cash deposit, totaling $3,000,000.00\"), the 'Cash deposit' and $3,000,000.00 are correct. 'Bank deposit' and 'Fixed Assets' entries are erroneous duplications/mismatches.\n- All other fields either agree with the invoice or are empty, so only these are listed.\n\nIf you wish, I can continue to process and check for other errors in the remainder of the data. The above solution matches your requested template and reflects the inconsistencies present in your provided dataset.",
