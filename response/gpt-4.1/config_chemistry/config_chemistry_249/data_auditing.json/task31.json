According to the invoice summary, on Dec 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Cash deposit totaling $3000000, a Bank deposit totaling $5000000, and a Fixed Asset totaling $5000000, all with the same ID. In general, a single transaction ID should relate to a single economic event. Here, it seems the amounts and categories have been split across rows with the same transaction ID, which should not occur. Each should have a unique ID. The most reliable values are those stated in the invoice risk_issues field, so: for Cash deposit, Original amount: 3000000.0; for Bank deposit, Original amount: 5000000.0; for Fixed Assets, Original amount: 5000000.0. However, only one of these should correspond to ID Initial20231231001; the others should have different IDs. No way to assign which should keep the ID, but at least two are mismatched.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\":\"Initial20231231001\",\n    \"Original category\":\"Fixed Assets\",\n    \"Recorded category\":\"Bank deposit\",\n    \"Original amount\":\"5000000.0\",\n    \"Recorded amount\":\"5000000.0\",\n    \"Explanation\":\"Same as above.

According to the invoice description, this should be unpaid and via account payable. So, if in the provided table it's marked as paid or with bank transfer or cash, it should be corrected to unpaid and account payable.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\":\"Sale20240113021\",\n    \"Original quantity\":\"1.0\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\":\"0.0\",\n    \"Original amount\":\"115227.49\",\n    \"Recorded amount\":\"128075.32\",\n    \"Original tax\":\"5761.37\",\n    \"Recorded tax\":\"127700.27\",\n    \"Original price\":\"115227.49\",\n    \"Recorded price\":\"122464.64\",\n    \"Explanation\":\"The risk_issues field describes a sale for 1 unit at a unit price of 115227.49 (total 115227.49), not 0 units at 122464.64 (total 128075.32); tax should be 5761.37 not 127700.27.
