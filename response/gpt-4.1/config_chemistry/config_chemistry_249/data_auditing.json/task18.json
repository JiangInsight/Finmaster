Should be quantity 2.0, profit 25927.76, status Paid (cash transaction).\"\n  }\n]}\n```\n**Explanation**:\n- The Initial20231231001 id is used for three entries. The invoice always refers to a $5,000,000 Bank deposit, but the other entries record differing types (Cash deposit, Fixed Assets) and a $3,000,000 value. The only value and type consistent with the invoice is $5,000,000 Bank deposit.\n- For Sale20240116028, the quantity should match invoice (2.0), as should profit ($25,927.76), and status should be Paid (since invoice says cash received).\n- For Purchase20231231001, 'recorded_cost_per_unit' is superfluous since only 'recorded_unit_price' is used on the invoice.\n- Only the entries with invoices that clearly provide a different figure than the recorded value are corrected; entries where the invoice and transaction agree are not listed. If more such discrepancies are found in other entries, add them similarly.",
