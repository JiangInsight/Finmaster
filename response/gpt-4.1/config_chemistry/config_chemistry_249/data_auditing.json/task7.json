Initial20231231001\n- Three records for Initial20231231001, but invoice shows $3,000,000 for cash deposit, $5,000,000 for bank deposit, $5,000,000 for fixed assets.\n- Based on standard equity structure, these should be consistent (e.g., equity injection splits into cash/bank/fixed asset, totaling the same amount). The mismatched values show an internal inconsistency.\n- The invoice usually reflects the truth; multiple amounts for the same transaction id are a red flag unless there's documentation to support both.\n- Estimated correct values: All amounts should likely be $3,000,000 each or all $5,000,000 each, but since the cash deposit specifically matches the invoice, probably $3,000,000 is correct.\n\n#### 2. Purchase20231231001 (No internal inconsistency found)\n- All fields recorded in internal system match the invoice, so no error.\n\n#### 3. Interest20240102002\n- Receive_method is \"Interest receviable\" in the record, which matches the notification, so no error.\n\n#### 4. Sale20240113022\n- Internal system: receive_method = \"Interest receivable\"\n- Invoice: receive_method = \"Cash\"\n- Based on the reliable \"invoice\" field, the correct receive_method should be \"Cash\".\n- All other fields match.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The above solution only lists records where inconsistencies are found, in the manner shown in the example and as required in the instructions. If you want the full list of problem records across the entire table, please clarify! The reasoning for any other records not included is that, upon detailed checking, the invoice and internal records are consistent.",
