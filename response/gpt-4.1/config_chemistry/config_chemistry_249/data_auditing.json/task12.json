Duplicated/contradictory initial entry (Initial20231231001)\n- There are three entries with id `Initial20231231001`, with categories: \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", and \"Fixed Assets\", and amounts: 3,000,000.0, 5,000,000.0, 5,000,000.0 respectively.\n- \"Initial\" entries typically represent fund or asset injection; only one `InitialXXXX` per event is expected. These entries may be due to incorrect splitting/duplication or misunderstanding of structure.\n- According to the invoice, a deposit/funding action occurred on Dec 31, 2023.\n- **Inconsistency:** Multiple, not one, initial entries, with different categories and overlapping amounts, possibly inconsistent with the real initial capital event.\n- **Correction:** There needs to be only one \"Initial\" per event, with appropriate break-down for asset type rather than repeating the id with different \"categories\".\n\n#### 2. Purchase20231231005: Payment Status/Method Contradiction\n- For id `Purchase20231231005`, invoice says: \"payment_method was account payable\" and \"this transaction was unpaid\".\n- However, in the record:\n    - `recorded_payment/receipt_status` = \"Paid\"\n    - `recorded_payment_method` = \"Bank Transfer\"\n    - But the standard for `Account Payable` method would be \"Unpaid\", paid only when settled.\n    - The cost per unit and quantity is consistent with the amount (20000Ã—23=460000).\n    - **Correction:** The payment status should be Unpaid and payment_method should be Account Payable.\n\n#### 3. Expense20240111001: Approver Missing\n- For id `Expense20240111001`, in one line the recorded_approver field is empty (not \"Director\") whereas the others for similar transactions always have the approver as \"Director\".\n- The invoice always references \"Director\" as the approver.\n- **Correction:** Approver should be \"Director\".\n\n---\n\nFurther possible errors (from other entries) were not clear based only on the provided data. Most amounts, products, costs, etc., match their invoice descriptions. If there are others with clear contradictions (like negative expense/interest, or part-sums not matching), they were not clear in this sample.",
