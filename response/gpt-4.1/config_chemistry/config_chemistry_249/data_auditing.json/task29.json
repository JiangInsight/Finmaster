All numeric entries (\"amount\", \"unit price\", etc.) correspond between the main data and the invoice narrative. There are no conflicting or reversed values, and all meta fields like preparer/approver match or are blank as per category requirements.\n- Therefore, all the \"Original ___\" and \"Recorded ___\" values in the output are null, indicating no inconsistency found in any row of this subset.\n- If you are looking for a specific type of error or need a different row checked, please clarify or provide which ID appears wrong!\n```",
