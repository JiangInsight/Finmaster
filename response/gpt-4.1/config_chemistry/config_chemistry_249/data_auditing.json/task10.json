Calculated profit as amount - cost_amount, and checked if tax and after_tax_amount match.\n\n2. **Duplicated/Consistent Transactions**: Many rows are consistent (especially fixed asset or expense entries): the field matches the details given in invoice.\n\n3. **Errors/Discrepancies Found**:\n    - **Sale20240123042** and **Sale20240114023**: These have documented profit inaccuracies (cross-proven by included \"risk issues\" and by calculation).\n    - For purchases/sales, I checked whether paid status matches the payment method and invoice, but all other examined inconsistencies are not actual data errors, just completeness of entry.\n\n4. **No Obvious Calculation Mismatches Elsewhere**: Other checks (such as Purchase, Expense, and Transfer entries) matched the invoice. Where status/payment method seems odd (e.g., \"Unpaid\" with \"Account Payable\"), this is actually correct accounting logic (i.e., unpaid on account).\n\n5. **Noted for Fullness**: While I included a couple of 'correct' examples to show the method, only the two profit calculation errors are flagged as real inconsistencies.\n\n6. **Summary**: Only those two sales transactions had clearly internally inconsistent profit fields in the context of invoice/row data. All other sample entries are internally consistent or match invoice.\n\nIf you want only the actual errors, remove examples like Purchase20231231001 and Purchase20231231005 above. The \"risk issues\" column and invoice field are central for reconciling disputed numbers.",
