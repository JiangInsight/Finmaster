Correct should be '2024-01-10'.\n- For **Expense20240129001** (first entry), the \"invoice\" states the date as January 29, 2024, but the row has 2024-02-14: the correct date is 2024-01-29.\n- The rest of the fields (payment/receipt_status, amount, method, etc.) are all consistent per row according to the invoice narrative.\n- No further inconsistencies are apparent for this subset.\n\nIf more were required, e.g., for mismatches in amount, method, or category, those would be added similarly.",
