But the ID should either be different for each line, or the amounts and compositions should add up—here `5000000.0` (bank) and `5000000.0` (fixed assets) both for the same ID—while cash shows as `3000000.0`.\n- This means the entire structure is internally inconsistent: The same ID re-used for three distinctly described transactions and amounts. The invoice text further confirms it as three separate items, so each category should have a unique line/ID.\n- All other fields are empty, so no need to estimate other values.\n- Since we are to show the inconsistency for *each entry* (i.e. each line), the three result objects above are produced.\n\n**No issues detected for other records in this excerpt.**",
