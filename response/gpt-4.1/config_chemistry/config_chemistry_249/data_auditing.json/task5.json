It appears to have conflated three separate asset introductions into one ID.\",\n    \"Step-by-step\": \"The same id (Initial20231231001) is used for three types: Cash deposit ($3,000,000), Bank deposit ($5,000,000), and Fixed Assets ($5,000,000), each with identical dates but different amounts/types. Generally, initial capital is split into these categories, not merged.

Each should be distinct, or at a minimum, a 'split' entry for each asset. This is an internal consistency errorâ€”no single transaction ID should refer to multiple, separately described deposits/assets.\n- **Second error**: The sale record shows a quantity and amount of zero, but all other fields and the invoice sentence are consistent with a sale of 1 unit for $115,227.49. This is a clear data entry inconsistency.\n\nBoth inconsistencies are detected solely based on internal information, with priority to the more reliable, standardized invoice field.",
