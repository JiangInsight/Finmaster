Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit: \"Accounts Receivable\" (from Balance Sheet, End_amount column)\n- 2. Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation: \"Financial Expenses\" (from Income Statement, Amount column)\n- 3. Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" (from Cash Flow Statement, Amount column)\n\nExtract them:\n1. Balance Sheet: \"Accounts Receivable\" End_amount = 3098023.69\n2. Income Statement: \"Financial Expenses\" Amount = 657075.51\n3. Cash Flow Statement: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" Amount = 666078.18\n\nSo, the filled solution is above.",
