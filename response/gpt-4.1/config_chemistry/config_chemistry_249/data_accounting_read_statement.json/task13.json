The task is to identify and extract the value of total assets that are not expected to be realised or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle.\n2. Such assets are classified as non-current assets (for example, Fixed Assets, PPE, long-term investments, Intangible assetsâ€”though only \"Fixed Assets\" appears in this example).\n3. From the given problem table, \"Total Non-current Assets\" is the relevant figure because it sums up all assets not expected to be realized or sold/consumed in the operating cycle.\n4. Initial value of \"Total Non-current Assets\" is 5,000,000.00 on 2023-12-31.\n5. End value of \"Total Non-current Assets\" is 5,565,838.29 on 2024-02-01.\n\nThus, the required solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5565838.29'} }\n```",
