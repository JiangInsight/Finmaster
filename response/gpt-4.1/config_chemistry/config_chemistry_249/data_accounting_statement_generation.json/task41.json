Since there was neither new unpaid purchase nor AP repayments, the net change is **zero**.\n\n**Step 7: Solution Format**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"0.00\"} }\n```\n\n## Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"0.00\"} }\n```",
