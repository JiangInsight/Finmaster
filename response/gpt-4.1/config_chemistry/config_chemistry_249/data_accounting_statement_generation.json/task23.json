Find all PURCHASES of inventory (i.e., purchases of any \"Chemical Product\"), with their purchased quantity and cost.\n2. Find all SALES of inventory, product by product, and sum the quantities sold per product.\n3. Calculate, using FIFO (since cost is constant per batch here anyway), the cost for each sale: quantity sold x unit cost for the batch it came from, until that batch is exhausted, etc.\n4. Add up cost_amounts if explicitly given in the SALES lines (it appears nearly always as \"cost_amount\").\n5. Double-check that cost_amount is present for each sale and all sales are included.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Identify all SALES entries with cost_amount\n\nLet's look at ALL lines with type = Sale.\n\nWe'll sum the \"cost_amount\" fields for all SALE rows.\n\n#### Let's find all SALE lines (date and product, quantity, cost_amount):\n\nLet's process sample lines below; they usually look like this:\n\n|Sale...| Sale | .... | cost_amount | ... | ...|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| ... | Sale | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |  cost_amount  | ... | ... |\n\nNow, let's scan for all \"Sale\" lines and extract their cost_amount.\n\n#### Extracting cost_amount from SALE entries:\n\n(We'll go through each SALE line and sum the cost_amount.)\n\nLet's do that systematically.\n\n#### Go line by line for SALEs:\n\n1. 2024-01-03 | P003 | 3.0 | cost_amount: 150000.0\n2. 2024-01-04 | P003 | 5.0 | cost_amount: 250000.0\n3. 2024-01-05 | P002 | 2.0 | cost_amount: 40000.0\n4. 2024-01-06 | P003 | 4.0 | cost_amount: 200000.0\n5. 2024-01-06 | P004 | 5.0 | cost_amount: 500000.0\n6. 2024-01-07 | P003 | 4.0 | cost_amount: 200000.0\n7. 2024-01-08 | P003 | 5.0 | cost_amount: 250000.0\n8. 2024-01-08 | P003 | 2.0 | cost_amount: 100000.0\n9. 2024-01-09 | P004 | 5.0 | cost_amount: 500000.0\n10. 2024-01-10 | P001 | 1.0 | cost_amount: 10000.0\n11. 2024-01-10 | P004 | 2.0 | cost_amount: 200000.0\n12. 2024-01-11 | P001 | 2.0 | cost_amount: 20000.0\n13. 2024-01-12 | P002 | 1.0 | cost_amount: 20000.0\n14. 2024-01-12 | P004 | 2.0 | cost_amount: 200000.0\n15. 2024-01-13 | P004 | 1.0 | cost_amount: 100000.0\n16. 2024-01-13 | P001 | 1.0 | cost_amount: 10000.0\n17. 2024-01-14 | P003 | 5.0 | cost_amount: 250000.0\n18. 2024-01-14 | P001 | 1.0 | cost_amount: 10000.0\n19. 2024-01-15 | P003 | 4.0 | cost_amount: 200000.0\n20. 2024-01-15 | P002 | 1.0 | cost_amount: 20000.0\n21. 2024-01-16 | P003 | 2.0 | cost_amount: 100000.0\n22. 2024-01-17 | P003 | 4.0 | cost_amount: 200000.0\n23. 2024-01-17 | P002 | 2.0 | cost_amount: 40000.0\n24. 2024-01-18 | P002 | 1.0 | cost_amount: 20000.0\n25. 2024-01-19 | P001 | 3.0 | cost_amount: 30000.0\n26. 2024-01-19 | P003 | 2.0 | cost_amount: 100000.0\n27. 2024-01-20 | P004 | 5.0 | cost_amount: 500000.0\n28. 2024-01-21 | P002 | 4.0 | cost_amount: 80000.0\n29. 2024-01-22 | P003 | 5.0 | cost_amount: 250000.0\n30. 2024-01-22 | P002 | 2.0 | cost_amount: 40000.0\n31. 2024-01-23 | P003 | 4.0 | cost_amount: 200000.0\n32. 2024-01-23 | P001 | 2.0 | cost_amount: 20000.0\n33. 2024-01-24 | P001 | 1.0 | cost_amount: 10000.0\n34. 2024-01-24 | P004 | 2.0 | cost_amount: 200000.0\n35. 2024-01-25 | P004 | 2.0 | cost_amount: 200000.0\n36. 2024-01-26 | P002 | 1.0 | cost_amount: 20000.0\n37. 2024-01-29 | P004 | 2.0 | cost_amount: 200000.0\n38. 2024-01-29 | P001 | 4.0 | cost_amount: 40000.0\n39. 2024-01-30 | P003 | 2.0 | cost_amount: 100000.0\n40. 2024-01-30 | P002 | 1.0 | cost_amount: 20000.0\n41. 2024-01-31 | P003 | 2.0 | cost_amount: 100000.0\n\nLet's count up the cost_amounts.\n\n#### Add all cost_amounts:\n\nLet's write them in a list for summing:\n\n150000.0  \n250000.0  \n40000.0  \n200000.0  \n500000.0  \n200000.0  \n250000.0  \n100000.0  \n500000.0  \n10000.0  \n200000.0  \n20000.0  \n20000.0  \n200000.0  \n100000.0  \n10000.0  \n250000.0  \n10000.0  \n200000.0  \n20000.0  \n100000.0  \n200000.0  \n40000.0  \n20000.0  \n30000.0  \n100000.0  \n500000.0  \n80000.0  \n250000.0  \n40000.0  \n200000.0  \n20000.0  \n10000.0  \n200000.0  \n200000.0  \n20000.0  \n200000.0  \n40000.0  \n100000.0  \n20000.0  \n100000.0\n\nNow, let's sum these (some basic arithmetic):\n\nAdd by chunks for clarity.\n\nFirst 10:\n1.  150000   \n2.  250000   → 400,000  \n3.   40000   → 440,000  \n4.  200000   → 640,000  \n5.  500000   → 1,140,000  \n6.  200000   → 1,340,000  \n7.  250000   → 1,590,000  \n8.  100000   → 1,690,000  \n9.  500000   → 2,190,000  \n10.  10000   → 2,200,000  \n\nNext 10:  \n11.  200000   → 2,400,000  \n12.  20000    → 2,420,000  \n13.  20000    → 2,440,000  \n14.  200000   → 2,640,000  \n15.  100000   → 2,740,000  \n16.  10000    → 2,750,000  \n17.  250000   → 3,000,000  \n18.  10000    → 3,010,000  \n19.  200000   → 3,210,000  \n20.  20000    → 3,230,000  \n\nNext 10:  \n21.  100000   → 3,330,000  \n22.  200000   → 3,530,000  \n23.   40000   → 3,570,000  \n24.   20000   → 3,590,000  \n25.   30000   → 3,620,000  \n26.  100000   → 3,720,000  \n27.  500000   → 4,220,000  \n28.   80000   → 4,300,000  \n29.  250000   → 4,550,000  \n30.   40000   → 4,590,000\n\nNext 10:  \n31. 200000    → 4,790,000  \n32. 20000     → 4,810,000  \n33. 10000     → 4,820,000  \n34. 200000    → 5,020,000  \n35. 200000    → 5,220,000  \n36. 20000     → 5,240,000  \n37. 200000    → 5,440,000  \n38. 40000     → 5,480,000  \n39. 100000    → 5,580,000  \n40. 20000     → 5,600,000  \n\nLeft:  \n41. 100000    → 5,700,000\n\n---\n\n**Total Cost of Goods Sold:** **5,700,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### **Final JSON answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cost of Goods Sold\": \"5700000.00\"} }\n```\n---\n\n**Explanation:**  \nAll sales entries have a \"cost_amount\" value, which represents the cost for that sale.
