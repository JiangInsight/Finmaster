Identify Initial Value\n\nLooking for a row with type \"Bank deposit\":\n- Row:  \n  | Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0 | ...  \n  Thus, **Initial Value = 5,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify All Bank-Related Changes\n\nBank deposits change through:\n1. **Bank Transfers (Paid purchases with \"Bank Transfer\" as payment_method):** *decrease*\n2. **Bank to Cash transfers:** *decrease*\n3. **Cash to Bank transfers:** *increase*\n\nLet's tally each:\n\n---\n\n### 2.1. Purchases Paid by Bank Transfer\n\nFind rows:\n- Purchase20231231001 | Paid | Bank Transfer | ... | amount=340,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231003 | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount=600,000.0    \n- Purchase20231231007 | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount=850,000.0    \n- Purchase20231231011 | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount=1,100,000.0  \n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount=362,437.67  \n- Purchase20231231001 | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount=340,000.0 (This is repeat, just one row for each purchase)  \n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Paid | Bank Transfer ... | amount=362,437.67  \n- Purchase20231231003 | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount=600,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231007 | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount=850,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231011 | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount=1,100,000.0  \n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount=362,437.67  \n- Purchase20231231001 | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount=340,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231003 | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount=600,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231007 | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount=850,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231011 | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount=1,100,000.0  \n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount=362,437.67  \n- Purchase20231231001 | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount=340,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231003 | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount=600,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231007 | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount=850,000.0  \n- Purchase20231231011 | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount=1,100,000.0  \n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount=362,437.67  \n(NOTE: Actually, these appear only once each, not repeated.)\n\nLet’s total:\n- 340,000.00 (Purchase20231231001)\n- 600,000.00 (Purchase20231231003)\n- 850,000.00 (Purchase20231231007)\n- 1,100,000.00 (Purchase20231231011)\n- 362,437.67 (FixedAsset20231231001)\n- 303,640.51 (FixedAsset20231231001, Processing Equipment5—yes, distinct asset)\n\n#### Purchases by bank transfer:\n- 340,000 + 600,000 + 850,000 + 1,100,000 + 362,437.67 + 303,640.51 =  \n- (340,000 + 600,000) = 940,000  \n- (940,000 + 850,000) = 1,790,000  \n- (1,790,000 + 1,100,000) = 2,890,000  \n- (2,890,000 + 362,437.67) = 3,252,437.67  \n- (3,252,437.67 + 303,640.51) = **3,556,078.18**\n\n---\n\n### 2.2. Bank to Cash Transfers\n\nThese \"Transfer\" rows with \"Bank to cash\" in the type description:\n- Transfer20240109001 | Bank to cash transfer | amount=100,000.0\n- Transfer20240110001 | Bank to cash transfer | amount=100,000.0 (multiple, let’s see how many)  \n- Transfer20240110001 appears: five times on that date.\n- Transfer20240111001 | Bank to cash transfer | amount=100,000.0 (again, appears multiple times)  \n\nCount the number of times:\nJanuary 9: 1\nJanuary 10: 5\nJanuary 11: 5\nJanuary 12: 1\nJanuary 13: 1\nJanuary 14: 1\n\nBut let's be careful. For each transfer, both a debit and credit is shown, but are they the same transaction? If the purpose is to reflect the reduction of bank deposit (outflow), only one entry per transfer is counted.\n\nLooking at the **Examples** in prompt for very similar data, multiple transfer entries of \"Cash to bank\" are all counted *together* and just summed.\n\nFor 'Bank to cash transfer', each such row reduces bank deposits by amount.\n\n- Transfer20240109001 | Bank to cash transfer | 2024-01-09 | amount=100,000.0                 (1)\n- Transfer20240110001 | Bank to cash transfer | 2024-01-10 | amount=100,000.0 x5              (5)\n- Transfer20240111001 | Bank to cash transfer | 2024-01-11 | amount=100,000.0 x5              (5)\n- Transfer20240112001 | Bank to cash transfer | 2024-01-12 | amount=100,000.0                  (1)\n- Transfer20240113001 | Bank to cash transfer | 2024-01-13 | amount=100,000.0                  (1)\n- Transfer20240114001 | Bank to cash transfer | 2024-01-14 | amount=100,000.0                  (1)\n\nTotal \"Bank to cash\":  \n1 (Jan 9)  \n5 (Jan 10)  \n5 (Jan 11)  \n1 (Jan 12)  \n1 (Jan 13)  \n1 (Jan 14)  \nSum: 1+5+5+1+1+1 = 14\n\n14 transfers × 100,000 = **1,400,000.00** decrease\n\n---\n\n### 2.3. Cash to Bank Transfers\n\nAre there \"Cash to bank transfer\" entries?  \nAlthough most are 'Bank to cash', there is at least one:\n\n- Transfer20240128001 | Cash to bank transfer | 2024-01-28 | amount=100,000.0\n\nHow many? Scanning for \"Cash to bank\":\nOnly one entry:  \n- Transfer20240128001 | Cash to bank transfer | 2024-01-28 | amount=100,000.0\n\nSo **+100,000.00** (increase)\n\n---\n\n### 2.4. Sales Paid By Bank Transfer\n\nCheck whether any 'Sale' is \"Paid\" and has payment_method = Bank Transfer.  \nFrom data, seems all Sales 'Paid' are by cash, or payment_method blank; no bank payments.\n\nLikewise for 'Purchase', we've previously accounted for bank transfers via purchases.\n\n---\n\n### 2.5. Fixed Asset Purchases Paid by Bank Transfer\n\nAlready included above.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Sum Up All Changes\n\nStart Value: 5,000,000.00\n\nSubtract all paid by bank transfer (Purchases+Fixed Assets):  \n-3,556,078.18\n\nSubtract all 'Bank to cash' transfers:\n-1,400,000.00\n\nAdd all 'Cash to bank' transfers:\n+100,000.00\n\nSum:\n5,000,000.00  - 3,556,078.18  - 1,400,000.00  + 100,000.00  =\n\nStep 1: 5,000,000.00 - 3,556,078.18 = 1,443,921.82  \nStep 2: 1,443,921.82 - 1,400,000.00 = 43,921.82  \nStep 3: 43,921.82 + 100,000.00 = **143,921.82**\n\n---\n\n## 4. Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"143921.82\"}}\n```",
