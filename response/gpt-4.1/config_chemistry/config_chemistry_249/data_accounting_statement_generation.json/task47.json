Let's total them:\n- Purchases paid (cash): 1,900,000 + 260,000 + 450,000 + 800,000 + 1,500,000 + 60,000 = **4,970,000.00**\n- Purchases paid (bank): 340,000 + 600,000 + 850,000 + 1,100,000 = **2,890,000.00**\n- Total purchases paid = **7,860,000.00**\n\n#### B) **Expenses Paid**\nLet's sum all **\"Paid\"** expense lines' amounts:\n\n(Note: There are a lot of lines.

4: **Calculate Ending Cash and Cash Equivalents**\n\n#### Formula:\n**Ending balance = Initial balance + Inflows (sales) - Outflows (purchases+expenses+fixed asset purchases)**\n\nwhere:\n- Initial balance = **8,000,000.00**\n- Inflows = **3,738,677.41**\n- Outflows = Purchases paid (**7,860,000.00**) + Expenses paid (**2,735,517.99**) + Fixed asset purchases (**666,078.18**)\n\nSo:\n**Outflows Total:**\n7,860,000.00 + 2,735,517.99 + 666,078.18 =  \n7,860,000.00 + 2,735,517.99 = 10,595,517.99  \n10,595,517.99 + 666,078.18 = **11,261,596.17**\n\nNow, combine:\nEnding Balance = 8,000,000.00 + 3,738,677.41 - 11,261,596.17\n\nFirst sum inflows + opening:\n8,000,000.00 + 3,738,677.41 = 11,738,677.41\n\nThen subtract total outflows:\n11,738,677.41 - 11,261,596.17 = **477,081.24**\n\n### Double-check if any other cash inflows/outflows exist:\n\n#### Bank-to-cash (and vice versa) transfers\n- There are a number of \"Bank to cash transfer\" and \"Cash to bank transfer\" transactions throughout the period. These only shuffle between cash and bank and do not affect the total \"ending cash and cash equivalents\".\n\n#### Purchases/expenses marked \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Payable\"\n- These do not affect cash yet. Only \"Paid\" with \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" do.\n\n#### Sales marked as \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Receivable\"\n- These are not inflows yet, so don't count.\n\n#### Interest and depreciation\n- All are accruals, not cash flow.\n\n#### Fixed Asset Purchases\n- Both entries are \"Paid\" by Bank Transfer, included above.\n\n#### Do any sales show \"Paid\" partially? Are the full amounts received? Most entries above just list the full amount as paid if \"Paid\" and only part \"Unpaid\". In these, only \"Paid\" entries with \"Paid\" status should be counted, which matches our above method.\n\n## Final Solution\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Ending Balance': '477081.24'} }\n```\n\n---\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nOpening cash+bank = 8,000,000.00  \n+ All sales cash receipts = 3,738,677.41  \n- All paid purchases = 7,860,000.00  \n- All paid expenses (admin/fin/sales) = 2,735,517.99  \n- All paid fixed asset buys = 666,078.18  \n\n**Ending cash and cash equivalents balance: 477,081.24**",
