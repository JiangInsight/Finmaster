These almost always appear as the earliest \"Initial\" entries and typically consist of bank, cash, and perhaps asset forms of investment (e.g., fixed assets).\n   - In the data:\n     - Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n     - Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n     - Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.0\n   - Total initial paid-in capital = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = **13,000,000.00**\n\n3. **Check for Additional Capital Injections or Withdrawals**:\n   - Go through all transactions for any additional \"Initial\", \"Capital Increase\", \"Capital Decrease\", \"Owner's Withdrawal\", or similar entries that would impact paid-in capital.\n   - In this data, **there are no such entries** after the initial three.\n\n4. **Confirm Paid-in Capital at Period End**:\n   - Since there have been no new capital injections nor withdrawals, the end value remains unchanged from the initial value: **13,000,000.00**\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Paid-in Capital does not change unless there's new owner/shareholder capital injection or a withdrawal. All purchases, expenses, sales etc. occur within the context of operating transactions and do not touch paid-in capital.\n\n**Final Answer:** The Paid-in Capital is unchanged from initial to ending balance, both being 13,000,000.00.",
