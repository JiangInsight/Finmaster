The prompt **EXAMPLES** show \"Transfer20240110001\" for \"Cash to bank transfer\".\n- For cash out, maybe I should count all lines for **cash-to-bank** only.\n- Let's check more closely for these transfers.\n\nFrom the data, let's specifically look for **Transfer** rows relating to cash **in** and cash **out**.\n\n### a) **Bank to Cash Transfer (Cash In)**\n\nFrom the table, \"Transfer<date><num>\" with description:\n\nScan the description (can't see in 'type', but from prior example, these are specifically described as \"Bank to cash transfer\" or \"Cash to bank transfer\").\n\nBut in this table, many are \"Bank to cash transfer\", but from 2024-01-28 we start seeing \"Cash to bank transfer\":\n- Transfer20240128001 | Cash to bank transfer | 2024-01-28 | 100,000\n- Transfer20240128001 | Cash to bank transfer | 2024-01-28 | 100,000\n- Transfer20240128001 | Cash to bank transfer | 2024-01-28 | 100,000\n\n- Transfer20240129001 | Cash to bank transfer | (multiple times etc.)\n\nSo, in my earlier count, I might have accidentally included \"Cash to bank\" as cash in, instead of as cash out.\n\n**Let me REVISE:**\n\n- Only **Bank to cash transfer** increase cash on hand.\n- **Cash to bank transfer** decrease cash on hand.\n\nLet's list **all** transfer lines and their purpose:\n\n- Transfer20240109001 | Bank to cash transfer | +100,000\n- Transfer20240110001 | Bank to cash transfer | +100,000\n- Transfer20240110001 | Bank to cash transfer | +100,000\n- Transfer20240110001 | Bank to cash transfer | +100,000\n- Transfer20240110001 | Bank to cash transfer | +100,000\n- Transfer20240111001 | Bank to cash transfer | +100,000\n- Transfer20240111001 | Bank to cash transfer | +100,000\n- Transfer20240111001 | Bank to cash transfer | +100,000\n- Transfer20240111001 | Bank to cash transfer | +100,000\n- Transfer20240112001 | Bank to cash transfer | +100,000\n- Transfer20240113001 | Bank to cash transfer | +100,000\n- Transfer20240114001 | Bank to cash transfer | +100,000\n\nThen, starting 2024-01-28:\n\n- Transfer20240128001 | Cash to bank transfer | -100,000\n- Transfer20240128001 | Cash to bank transfer | -100,000\n- Transfer20240128001 | Cash to bank transfer | -100,000\n\n- Transfer20240129001 | Cash to bank transfer | -100,000 (multiple lines; let's count)\n\nChecking each \"Cash to bank transfer\":\n---  \nTransfer20240128001: appears 3 times on 2024-01-28.  \nTransfer20240129001: appears 7 times (2024-01-29).\n\nAlso:\n- Transfer20240130001 | Cash to bank transfer | -100,000 (2024-01-30)\n\nTotal \"Cash to bank transfer\" lines: 3 (28001) + 7 (29001) + 1 (30001) = 11\n\nSo, total \"Cash to bank transfer\": 11 × 100,000 = **1,100,000 OUT**\n\n\"Bank to cash transfer\" (earlier): as above, 12 × 100,000 = **1,200,000 IN**\n\n---\n\n### **Adjusted Transfers**\n\n- Add to inflows: +1,200,000 (\"Bank to cash transfer\")\n- Subtract from outflows: +1,100,000 (\"Cash to bank transfer\")\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Update Calculations**\n\nReview purchases by cash:  \nRecheck table — okay.\n\nExpenses paid by cash: as above.\n\nCash to bank transfer total: 1,100,000 (not 1,000,000 like before).\n\n## 8. **Add Up**\n\n#### **Inflows**\n\n- Initial: 3,000,000.00\n- Cash from sales: 3,447,464.41\n- Bank to cash transfer: 1,200,000.00\n\nTotal: 3,000,000.00 + 3,447,464.41 + 1,200,000.00 = **7,647,464.41**\n\n#### **Outflows**\n\n- Purchases via cash: 4,970,000.00\n- Expenses via cash: 2,735,518.02\n- Cash to bank transfers: 1,100,000.00\n\nTotal: 4,970,000.00 + 2,735,518.02 + 1,100,000.00 = **8,805,518.02**\n\n---\n\n## 9. **Final Ending Cash Calculation**\n\nEnding Cash = 7,647,464.41 - 8,805,518.02 = **-1,158,053.61**\n\nStill negative.\n\n---\n\n## 10. **Cross-check — Are There Any Overlaps or Double Counting?**\n\n**A key point:**  \n - Each transfer is two lines per move (one reduces cash, one increases bank, or vice versa, or occurs as a pair in the system).  \n   **Are both sides present in the transaction list?**  \n - E.g.: Transfer20240109001 | Bank to cash transfer | 2024-01-09 | 100,000  \n   There's only one row (the other side is in the bank, not here).\n\nBut in the prompt's **Example**, they got a final value ~270,000 out of an initial cash of 3,000,000 with similar overall volume. Our negative value suggests possible **over-counting cash payments**.\n\n**Possible issue — Purchases Paid by Cash**\n\nAre all the cash purchases immediate?  \nCheck `payment/receipt_status = Paid` and `payment_method = Cash` — OK.  \nAre some outflows perhaps not yet settled (double check payments marked \"Unpaid\" — those should not reduce cash).\n\nAlso, for expenses, only rows with \"Paid\" and \"payment_method\" Cash, so OK.\n\nBut **cash on hand should not go negative**. Let's try to follow the example and make sure treatments are aligned:\n\n#### COMPARE EXAMPLE:\n\n- **Initial Cash:** 3,000,000.00\n- Total cash sales inflows: 1,199,395.39 (difference: ours is larger)\n- Cash expenses similar\n\n**In our data, it seems there are just too many purchases/expenses paid by cash given the inflows.**\n\nBut following the logical methodology as above, it's correct.\n\n---\n\n## 11. **Present Solution**\n\nEven though the number is negative, if all transactions are captured, we must show the computation as per transactions.\n\nHence, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\",\n  \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"-1158053.61\"\n}}\n```\n\n**Note:** A negative ending cash on hand implies that, per your supplied data, cash outflows (particularly large cash purchases and expenses) exceeded all inflows and initial cash. This would not be possible in real-life accounting, but reflects the transaction totals in your supplied dataset.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Submission**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\", \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"-1158053.61\"} }\n```\n",
