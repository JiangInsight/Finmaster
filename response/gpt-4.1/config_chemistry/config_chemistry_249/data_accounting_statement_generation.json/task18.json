In this data, Fixed Asset purchases after 2023-12-31 would be purchases using business funds, so not owner equity injections.**\n\n#### **Net Profit Calculation:**\n- **Income:** Sales + Interest Receivable\n- **Expense/COGS:** Cost Amount on sales, all Expenses (Admin, Sales, Financial, Depreciation)\n\n##### **a) Sum All 'Profit' Column in Sales**\n\nLooking through the table, each Sale line has a 'profit' field, representing **gross profit** (Sales minus Cost for each transaction).\n\nLet’s sum those.\n\nLet’s extract all profit lines and sum:\n\n- 2024-01-03 (C003): 16,756.74\n- 2024-01-04 (C005): 99,296.60\n- 2024-01-05 (C005): 4,250.22\n- 2024-01-06 (C001): 32,967.60\n- 2024-01-06 (C010): 59,227.55\n- 2024-01-07 (C007): 27,163.12\n- 2024-01-08 (C004): 41,213.00\n- 2024-01-08 (C001): 34,712.58\n- 2024-01-09 (C004): 61,752.55\n- ...

Value\": \"11305875.86\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Reasoning Summary**\n- Initial equity is the sum of the initial cash, bank, and fixed assets: 13,000,000.00\n- All profits from sales and interest are added; all operating expenses and depreciations are subtracted.\n- No capital injection/withdrawals detected.\n- Some rounding may exist due to cumulative sum; actual answer should be very close.\n\n---\n\n**If you require calculations based strictly on 'profit' fields only, you can disregard detailed COGS and product costs in each sale, as the profit field is after those. Otherwise, for more detail, sum sales income and subtract all costs per unit, then subtract all expenses. My method follows the 'profit' column given.**\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Total Owners Equity End Value\": \"11305875.86\"} }\n```",
