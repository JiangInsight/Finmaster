ACCOUNT RECEIVABLE - CASH FLOW STATEMENT\n\nAccording to the indirect method of preparing the cash flow statement:\n- (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable = Opening A/R – Closing A/R\n\n### A. Find Opening and Closing Accounts Receivable\n\n- Opening (2023-12-31): Let's check if there's any initial/previous accounts receivable. There are none in the opening balances. (No \"Initial...\" row for A/R)\n- Opening A/R = 0\n\n- Closing (2024-01-31): Let's sum up all sales during Jan '24 marked as **Unpaid** or **Account Receivable** and subtract all receipts from customers for prior credit sales (but there do not appear to be any \"receipts\" on account; all payments are at sale).\n- As none of the entries are for receipt of past A/R (i.e., \"collection from receivable\"), the closing A/R is just the sum of all Jan '24 sales on credit (Unpaid or with Account Receivable as receive_method). \n\n#### Let's list all credit sales (\"Sale\" whose payment/receipt_status is \"Unpaid\" or receive_method is \"Account Receivable\") for Jan 2024:\n\n**Sum up the `amount` column for each such entry:**\n\n| Date        | ID             | Amount     | Notes                     |\n|-------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------|\n| 2024-01-04  | Sale20240104004| 349296.6   | Account Receivable        |\n| 2024-01-05  | Sale20240105005| 44250.22   | Account Receivable        |\n| 2024-01-07  | Sale20240107009| 227163.12  | Account Receivable        |\n| 2024-01-08  | Sale20240108011| 134712.58  | Account Receivable        |\n| 2024-01-09  | Sale20240109012| 561752.55  | Account Receivable        |\n| 2024-01-13  | Sale20240113021| 115227.49  | Account Receivable        |\n| 2024-01-14  | Sale20240114023| 304144.8   | Account Receivable        |\n| 2024-01-14  | Sale20240114024| 12908.24   | Account Receivable        |\n| 2024-01-15  | Sale20240115026| 23326.93   | Account Receivable        |\n| 2024-01-17  | Sale20240117030| 47872.6    | Account Receivable        |\n| 2024-01-18  | Sale20240118032| 0          | <== not present           |\n| 2024-01-19  | Sale20240119034| 41627.94   | Account Receivable        |\n| 2024-01-20  | Sale20240120036| 556562.3   | Account Receivable        |\n| 2024-01-22  | Sale20240122041| 48657.34   | Account Receivable        |\n| 2024-01-24  | Sale20240124044| 12903.89   | Account Receivable        |\n| 2024-01-26  | Sale20240126048| 25576.4    | Account Receivable        |\n| 2024-01-29  | Sale20240129052| 264497.76  | Account Receivable        |\n| 2024-01-29  | Sale20240129053| 51823.64   | Account Receivable        |\n| 2024-01-30  | Sale20240130054| 122266.78  | Account Receivable        |\n| 2024-01-30  | Sale20240130055| 25115.39   | Account Receivable        |\n| 2024-01-31  | Sale20240131057| 128337.12  | Account Receivable        |\n\nLet's carefully go through the sales and match up with \"Unpaid\" or \"receive_method: Account Receivable\" (i.e., credit sales):\n\nFrom the given table, for each sale with Unpaid or receive_method = 'Account Receivable':\n\n#### Summing Amounts\n\nLet's go through each relevant entry:\n- 2024-01-04 | Sale20240104004 | 349,296.60\n- 2024-01-05 | Sale20240105005 | 44,250.22\n- 2024-01-07 | Sale20240107009 | 227,163.12\n- 2024-01-08 | Sale20240108011 | 134,712.58\n- 2024-01-09 | Sale20240109012 | 561,752.55\n- 2024-01-13 | Sale20240113021 | 115,227.49\n- 2024-01-14 | Sale20240114023 | 304,144.80\n- 2024-01-14 | Sale20240114024 | 12,908.24\n- 2024-01-15 | Sale20240115026 | 23,326.93\n- 2024-01-17 | Sale20240117030 | 47,872.60\n- 2024-01-19 | Sale20240119034 | 41,627.94\n- 2024-01-20 | Sale20240120036 | 556,562.30\n- 2024-01-22 | Sale20240122041 | 48,657.34\n- 2024-01-24 | Sale20240124044 | 12,903.89\n- 2024-01-26 | Sale20240126048 | 25,576.40\n- 2024-01-29 | Sale20240129052 | 264,497.76\n- 2024-01-29 | Sale20240129053 | 51,823.64\n- 2024-01-30 | Sale20240130054 | 122,266.78\n- 2024-01-30 | Sale20240130055 | 25,115.39\n- 2024-01-31 | Sale20240131057 | 128,337.12\n\nLet's sum all these amounts:\n\n| Date        | Amount        |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| 2024-01-04  | 349,296.60   |\n| 2024-01-05  | 44,250.22    |\n| 2024-01-07  | 227,163.12   |\n| 2024-01-08  | 134,712.58   |\n| 2024-01-09  | 561,752.55   |\n| 2024-01-13  | 115,227.49   |\n| 2024-01-14  | 304,144.80   |\n| 2024-01-14  | 12,908.24    |\n| 2024-01-15  | 23,326.93    |\n| 2024-01-17  | 47,872.60    |\n| 2024-01-19  | 41,627.94    |\n| 2024-01-20  | 556,562.30   |\n| 2024-01-22  | 48,657.34    |\n| 2024-01-24  | 12,903.89    |\n| 2024-01-26  | 25,576.40    |\n| 2024-01-29  | 264,497.76   |\n| 2024-01-29  | 51,823.64    |\n| 2024-01-30  | 122,266.78   |\n| 2024-01-30  | 25,115.39    |\n| 2024-01-31  | 128,337.12   |\n\nAdd all these up:\n\nLet's do it step by step (use separator):\n\n- Start at 0\n- +349,296.60 = 349,296.60\n- +44,250.22 = 393,546.82\n- +227,163.12 = 620,709.94\n- +134,712.58 = 755,422.52\n- +561,752.55 = 1,317,175.07\n- +115,227.49 = 1,432,402.56\n- +304,144.80 = 1,736,547.36\n- +12,908.24 = 1,749,455.60\n- +23,326.93 = 1,772,782.53\n- +47,872.60 = 1,820,655.13\n- +41,627.94 = 1,862,283.07\n- +556,562.30 = 2,418,845.37\n- +48,657.34 = 2,467,502.71\n- +12,903.89 = 2,480,406.60\n- +25,576.40 = 2,505,983.00\n- +264,497.76 = 2,770,480.76\n- +51,823.64 = 2,822,304.40\n- +122,266.78 = 2,944,571.18\n- +25,115.39 = 2,969,686.57\n- +128,337.12 = 3,098,023.69\n\nTotal = **3,098,023.69**\n\n**Checked, the sum is correct.**\n\n### B. Account for collections / receipts\n\nAre there any *payments received* on *prior credit sales* that should reduce the closing A/R?  \nWe need to double-check if there are any \"receipt_status\" of \"Paid\" with receive_method: \"Account Receivable\" or similar.  \nBut, in all \"Sale\" entries above, \"Paid\" lines use \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" or \"Cash\", and \"Unpaid\" ones use \"Account Receivable\" (and are in the above total).\n\nAlso, there do not appear to be \"collection from A/R\" lines, so **all these amounts remain in A/R as of the end of January.**\n\n### C. Opening and Closing A/R\n\n- Opening A/R: 0\n- Closing A/R: 3,098,023.69\n\n### D. (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\n\n= Opening – Closing  \n= 0 – 3,098,023.69  \n= **–3,098,023.69**\n\n(Negative because A/R increased during the month, which is a cash outflow in the indirect cash flow statement.)\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-3098023.69\"} }\n```",
