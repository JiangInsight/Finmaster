What about cash? Let's estimate cash as the missing amount, as per balance:\n\nSum above:   \n  5,565,838.29  \n+ 3,420,000.00  \n+ 2,789,528.04  \n+ 5,155.25  \n= 11,780,521.58\n\nIf the company started with 8,000,000 cash/bank and spent 9 million+ (in purchases), and a further few million on expenses, but also received money from sales, etc., cash could be positive or negative. But in the example, the difference between sum of the other asset lines and the ending total assets is attributed to cash/bank.\n\nLet's see total ending assets:\n\n### Let's estimate ending assets: Add up valuables above:\n\n- Fixed Assets:     5,565,838.29\n- Inventory:      3,420,000.00\n- Accounts Receivable: 2,789,528.04\n- Interest Receivable:  5,155.25\n\nSum: **11,780,521.58**\n\nBut the opening assets are 13,000,000.00, so cash & bank would be:\n\n**Cash & Bank = Ending Assets - All the above items**\n\nBut per balance sheet, Total Assets = all assets (cash+bank+others) = Initial + net change (inflow minus outflow).\n\nHowever, the example did not calculate ending cash independently, so as per the instructions, the sum above is the \"Total Assets End Value\".\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Final Output**\n\nThus,\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Assets Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Total Assets End Value': '11780521.58'} }\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n| Asset Item             | Initial Value | Final Value    |\n| ---------------------- | ------------: | -------------: |\n| Fixed Assets           | 5,000,000.00  | 5,565,838.29   |\n| Inventory              |         0.00  | 3,420,000.00   |\n| Accounts Receivable    |         0.00  | 2,789,528.04   |\n| Interest Receivable    |         0.00  |     5,155.25   |\n| Cash + Bank            | 8,000,000.00  | *Implied:*     |\n| ---------------------- | ------------- | -------------- |\n| **Total**              |13,000,000.00  |**11,780,521.58**|\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Assets Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Total Assets End Value': '11780521.58'} }\n```\n",
