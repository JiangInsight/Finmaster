No asset sales or other investing inflows can be seen.\n\nAll other \"Purchase\" rows are inventory for resale / operations (P001, P002, etc.), not fixed assets.\n\n**Step 2: Add up the investing activities (outflows & inflows).**\n- Outflows (purchases of fixed assets):\n  - 362,437.67 (Processing Equipment)\n  - 303,640.51 (Processing Equipment)\n\n- No cash inflow from sale of fixed assets is shown.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**\nNet = (all inflows) - (all outflows) = 0 - (362,437.67 + 303,640.51) = -666,078.18\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-666078.18\"} }\n```\n",
