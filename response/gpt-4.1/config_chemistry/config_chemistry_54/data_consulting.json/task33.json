Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n= Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Ending Total Current Liabilities  \n= -5,714,107.45 / 2,736,025.72  \n≈ -2.09\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n= Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Ending Total Current Liabilities  \n(Assume only current liabilities as in the previous sample; no explicit long-term debt)  \n= -5,714,107.45 / 2,736,025.72  \n≈ -2.09\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n= Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  \nInventory (Begin) = 0, (End) = 3,900,000  \nAverage Inventory = (0 + 3,900,000) / 2 = 1,950,000  \n= 5,580,000 / 1,950,000  \n≈ 2.86\n\n*(However, in the EXAMPLES provided, the ratio calculation when beginning inventory is 0 used Ending Inventory, so per consistent methodology:)*  \n= COGS / Ending Inventory  \n= 5,580,000 / 3,900,000  \n≈ 1.43\n\n*But in the provided example with similar pattern, the answer was 1.73 (for 4,410,000/5,090,000), which is 4,410,000/5,090,000 = 0.866; this suggests they've used average inventory, so let's use the average:*\n\nNew calculation:  \nAverage Inventory = (0 + 3,900,000)/2 = 1,950,000  \nInventory Turnover = 5,580,000 / 1,950,000 = 2.86  \nBut in the provided sample, it appears they just use End Inventory:  \nSo, let's answer as per the convention in the example:  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = 5,580,000 / 3,900,000 = 1.43\n\nBut in the example, for (COGS = 4,410,000, End Inv = 5,090,000) they calculated 1.73 (not 0.87 as per 4,410,000/5,090,000). Checking this:  \n4,410,000 / ((0+5,090,000)/2) = 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 = 1.73\n\nSo let's use the same average inventory!  \nAverage Inventory = 1,950,000  \nInventory Turnover = 5,580,000 / 1,950,000 = 2.86\n\nWait, but 1.73 was returned for 4,410,000/(0+5,090,000)/2=4,410,000/2,545,000=1.73.  \nFor this, 5,580,000/(0+3,900,000)/2=5,580,000/1,950,000=2.86\n\n**So Inventory Turnover Ratio = 2.86**\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n= Total Liabilities / Total Equity  \nTotal Liabilities = 2,736,025.72  \nTotal Equity = 11,330,150.23  \n= 2,736,025.72 / 11,330,150.23  \n≈ 0.24\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio\n= (Cash + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities  \n= (735,892.55 + 103,027.27 + 2,923,459.19 + 2,566.71) / 2,736,025.72  \n= (735,892.55 + 103,027.27 + 2,923,459.19 + 2,566.71) = 3,764,945.72  \n= 3,764,945.72 / 2,736,025.72  \n≈ 1.38\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n= Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \n= 7,664,945.72 / 2,736,025.72  \n≈ 2.80\n\n---\n\n#### Final JSON (rounded to 2 decimal places as in the example):\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-2.09\",\n  \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-2.09\",\n  \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"2.86\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.24\",\n  \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.38\",\n  \"Current Ratio\": \"2.80\"\n}}\n```\n*If you want to match the Inventory Turnover Ratio formatting in the sample, use 1.57 (see calculation below):*\n\nBut in the EXAMPLE, they used:  \nCOGS = 4,410,000  \nEnd Inv = 5,090,000  \nAverage Inv = (0+5,090,000)/2 = 2,545,000  \nTurnover = 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 = 1.73\n\nSo, for this problem:  \nCOGS = 5,580,000  \nAverage Inventory = (0+3,900,000)/2 = 1,950,000  \nTurnover = 5,580,000/1,950,000 = 2.86\n\nBut in your user's provided calculation, the ratio is lower than 2.86, possibly they ignore part of the computation.\n\nBut if we use End Inventory,  \n5,580,000 / 3,900,000 = 1.43\n\n*Let us keep to the average inventory method as in their example and answer with 2 decimals:*\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-2.09\",\n  \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-2.09\",\n  \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"2.86\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.24\",\n  \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.38\",\n  \"Current Ratio\": \"2.80\"\n}}\n```",
