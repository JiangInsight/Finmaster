entries are transfers from cash to bank or vice versa, within total cash/bank equivalents, so net effect on total is **zero**.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Compute Ending Cash & Equivalents**\n\n### **Formula**\n\n**Ending Balance** = (Initial Cash + Initial Bank)  \n**+** Inflows (from Paid sales)  \n**-** Outflows (for purchases and paid expenses and paid fixed asset purchases)\n\n---\n\n### **Plug in Numbers**\n\n- **Start**:  \n  8,000,000.00\n\n- **Plus: Cash Inflows**:\n  3,958,422.43\n\n- **Minus**  \n  Purchases (from section 2B): 8,536,972.73  \n  Paid Expenses (from section 4): 2,621,162.15\n\n----\n\n**Compute**:\n\nStep 1: Sum inflows  \n8,000,000.00 + 3,958,422.43 = **11,958,422.43**\n\nStep 2: Sum outflows  \n8,536,972.73 + 2,621,162.15 = **11,158,134.88**\n\nStep 3: Net ending  \n11,958,422.43 - 11,158,134.88 = **800,287.55**\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Solution/Check**\n\nTo double-check for possible unlisted \"outflow\" or \"inflow\" items:\n- Purchases Paid/Bank + Purchases Paid/Cash + Fixed Asset Purchases Paid/Bank\n- All expenses paid cash\n\n**Tip**: If there are purchases specified as \"Paid\" but paid via account payable or similar, they are still NOT net cash outflows unless specified \"Paid\" AND (Bank/Cash), which is what we've filtered for.\n\n## 8. **Final Answer**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"800287.55\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nThe solution is rounded to 2 decimal places, as all numbers are listed in 2 decimals.  \nYou can present the answer as:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"800287.55\"} }\n```",
