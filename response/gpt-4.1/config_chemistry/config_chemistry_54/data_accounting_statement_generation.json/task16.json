                        "content": "Let's solve the problem step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding \"Paid-in Capital\" in the problem\n\nPaid-in Capital (Share Capital, Registered Capital) is the total amount of funds contributed by shareholders/investors at the time of company setup or through capital increases. It is reflected in the equity section of the balance sheet.\n\n- **For newly registered companies**, this comes from \"Initial\" entries.\n- **Transactions such as purchase, sale, expenses, depreciation, interest, transfers, etc.**, do not ordinarily affect Paid-in Capital, except if there is a capital increase or decreaseâ€”these would be specifically recorded as such (not present here).\n- **Paid-in Capital typically does not change** unless there is a capital injection/withdrawal.\n\n### Step 2: Identify relevant transactions\n\n#### The only relevant rows for paid-in capital are with IDs:\n- \"Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | ... | 3,000,000.0\"\n- \"Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | ... | 5,000,000.0\"\n- \"Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | ... | 5,000,000.0\"\n\n#### All other entries are: Ordinary purchases, sales, expenses, depreciations, transfer, interest, etc.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Initial Value\n\nPaid-in Capital is **normally the total of these initial investments**.  Adding up as shown:\n\n- Cash:                   3,000,000.00\n- Bank:                   5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets:           5,000,000.00\n\n**Total Paid-in Capital = 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 13,000,000.00**\n\n### Step 4: Check for end-of-period changes\n\n- There are **NO additional entries in the data** representing capital increases or decreases.\n- Thus, **Paid-in Capital remains unchanged at the end of the period**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final Solution\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'} }\n```\n\n**Explanation**:  \nThe Paid-in Capital is determined solely by the three initial investment deposits (cash, bank, and fixed assets). There are no subsequent capital increases or decreases, so the value remains the same at the period end.",
