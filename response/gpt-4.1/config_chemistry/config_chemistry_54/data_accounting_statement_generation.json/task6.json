(P001) + 2,300,000 (P004) = 2,390,000.00**\n\nNow look at Expenses (all are paid in cash):\n\nSum of all 'Expense' transactions (all types: Sales/Administrative/Financial), these all reduce Cash/Bank:\n\nTake all \"Expense...\" lines and sum their \"amount\":\n\nList (manually - skipping only those of type \"Depreciation\", \"InterestReceivables\", \"Sale\", \"Purchase\", \"FixedAsset\",

478,737.63\n- 351,585.3\n- 386,528.93\n\nSum:\n\n230,120.87 + 478,737.63 = 708,858.50\n+ 351,585.3 = 1,060,443.80\n+ 386,528.93 = 1,446,972.73\n\nThese are all paid out in Bank, so **minus 1,446,972.73**\n\n---\n\n#### **Now Calculate Ending**\n\nLet's use all the above:\n\n- Initial Cash+Bank:           8,000,000.00\n- MINUS: Paid purchases:    -7,090,000.00\n- MINUS: Expense payments: -2,263,217.03\n    (both purchases and expenses are paid from cash/bank)\n- MINUS: Fixed Assets Paid: -1,446,972.73\n- PLUS: Paid sales received:  +4,020,163.82\n\nCalculate:\n\nStart: 8,000,000.00\n-7,090,000.00 = 910,000.00\n-2,263,217.03 = -1,353,217.03\n-1,446,972.73 = -2,800,189.76\n+4,020,163.82 = 1,219,974.06\n\nSo, **Ending Cash+Bank = 1,219,974.06**\n\n---\n\n### **Check for Consistency**\n\nTotal current assets at end should be:  \n- Cash+Bank:                 1,219,974.06\n- Inventory:                 3,900,000.00\n- AR:                        2,912,070.92\n- Interest Receivable:            2,566.70\n\nSum:\n\n1,219,974.06  \n+3,900,000.00 = 5,119,974.06  \n+2,912,070.92 = 8,032,044.98  \n+2,566.70 = 8,034,611.68\n\nBut since initial assets were 8,000,000 type (excluding Inventory; but in your initial balance, inventory was not listed separately, only cash/bank), but if opening inventory is sum of purchases, the math matches.\n\nBut, in practice, initial cash/bank includes payment for purchases. Thus, perhaps opening inventory is only the unpaid portion: 90,000 + 2,300,000 = 2,390,000, and the rest paid for stock is already removed from opening cash.\n\nBut per the Example in your question, just use cash+bank at start, and do not treat purchases as additional.\n\nThus, the real calculation must match your example approach:\n\n**Current Assets Include:**  \n- Cash+Bank\n- Accounts Receivable (unpaid sales)\n- Interest Receivable (unpaid interest)\n- Inventory (purchases paid for, not yet sold; but since all purchases after initial are paid with cash and cash is deducted, only inventory bought on credit is a current asset as 'inventory').\n\n**But in standard practice, for simplicity with your dataset, use:**\n- Initial: Cash + Bank = 8,000,000.00\n- End:\n    - Cash+Bank as above\n    - AR as summed\n    - Interest Receivable as summed\n\nAssume 'Inventory' held is not a current asset (since it's paid via cash and cash is adjusted accordingly in all transactions).\n\nLet's match the **Example output in your question**, which **excludes inventory**.\n\nThus, **Ending = Cash+Bank + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable**\n\n= 1,219,974.06 (Cash+Bank)  \n+ 2,912,070.92 (AR)  \n+ 2,566.70 (Interest Rec)  \n= **4,134,611.68**\n\n---\n\n## **Final Output**\n\n### **JSON Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"4134611.68\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of Steps for Clarity**\n- Initial current assets: cash + bank = 8,000,000.00\n- Ending current assets: cash + bank (after all cash inflows/outflows), plus AR from unpaid sales, plus interest receivables (unpaid)\n- Inventory changes are already reflected in the cash balances\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"4134611.68\"} }\n```",
