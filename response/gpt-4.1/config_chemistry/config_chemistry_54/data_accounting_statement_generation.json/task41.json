We look for all **Purchase** (or similar) transactions with \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Payable\" in \"payment/receipt_status\" and \"payment_method\".\n\n### Find Purchases Recorded as Account Payable (Increase)\nLet's search for all transactions of type \"Purchase\" with \"Unpaid\"/\"Account Payable\" as payment_status or payment_method for the period.\n\n**Purchases marked Unpaid/Account Payable:**\n| id                  | type     | payment/receipt_status | payment_method     | amount     |\n|---------------------|----------|-----------------------|--------------------|------------|\n| Purchase20231231003 | Purchase | Unpaid                | Account Payable    | 90000.00   |\n| Purchase20231231008 | Purchase | Unpaid                | Account Payable    | 2,300,000.00|\n\nTotal Increase:\n- 90,000.00 + 2,300,000.00 = 2,390,000.00\n\n## Step 2: Find Payments Made to Settle Account Payables (Decrease)\n\n- Look for Purchases that are marked \"Paid\" but with payment_method \"Account Payable\" -- indicating settlements of prior payables.\n- Review other payment transactions to suppliers (not found here), unless marked \"Paid\" under \"Account Payable\".\n\nOn review, **all other purchases are shown as \"Paid\" with payment methods like \"Cash\"/\"Bank Transfer\"**, not marked as settlements of prior account payables. None are clearing outstanding \"Account Payable\" except perhaps the normal purchases paid at time, which do not decrease the AP for this calculation.\n\nSo, **there is no direct settlement of previous Accounts Payable in the period**, only increases.\n\n## Step 3: Compute Net Change\n\n**Net Change in Accounts Payable = Increases - Decreases**\n- Increases: 2,390,000.00\n- Decreases: 0\n\n## Step 4: Result Formatting\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"2390000.00\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"2390000.00\"} }\n```",
