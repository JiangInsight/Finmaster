Let's check each transaction:\n\n#### Find Unpaid Purchases (type: \"Purchase\" AND \"Unpaid\"/\"Account Payable\")\n\n- | Purchase20231231003 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 90000.0 | ... | ... | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n- | Purchase20231231008 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 2300000.0 | ... | ... | ... | Unpaid | Account Payable | ... |\n\n#### All other \"Purchase\" transactions are marked as **Paid** (either by Bank Transfer or Cash).\n\n#### Sum the unpaid purchases:\n- 90,000.00 (Purchase20231231003)\n- 2,300,000.00 (Purchase20231231008)\n\n#### **Total Accounts Payable at Year End (End Value):**\n- 90,000 + 2,300,000 = **2,390,000.00**\n\n---\n\n## Solution in Requested JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"2390000.00\"} }\n```\n---\n\n### Additional Notes (for clarity)\n\n- We only consider unpaid/vendor purchases, not fixed asset purchases or fully paid purchase transactions.\n- Initial value is 0 because the starting balances do not include any payable.\n- End value is sum of all *purchase* type transactions clearly marked unpaid/account payable.",
