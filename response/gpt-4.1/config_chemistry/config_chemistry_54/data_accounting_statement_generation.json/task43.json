Summing Up\n\nRemember:\n- Cash receipts from sales: **4,020,163.82**\n- Cash paid for purchases: **5,390,000.00**\n- Cash paid for operating expenses: **2,621,162.15**\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = **CASH RECEIPTS** - **CASH PAYMENTS**\n\n= 4,020,163.82  \n- (5,390,000.00 + 2,621,162.15)  \n= 4,020,163.82 - 8,011,162.15  \n= -3,990,998.33\n\nWait: This result is negative and seems reasonable given the high operating outflows.\n\n**Rechecking:**\n- Opening cash is not included as cash flow (it's the starting balance, not an inflow for operations).\n- Cash paid for purchases includes both cash and bank transfer, which is correct for direct operating outflows if company paid cash/bank right away.\n- Expenses covered: Admin, sales, financial.\n\n### 3.5. FINAL CHECK: Any Missed Transactions?\n\n- Fixed Asset Purchases: IGNORE (investing activity)\n- Unpaid purchases/sales: IGNORE\n- Interest receivables: Not received in cash, IGNORE\n- Depreciation: IGNORE\n- Cash to bank transfers: IGNORE (not an inflow/outflow overall)\n\n**Therefore, answer is:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-3,990,998.33\"} }\n```\n\n**Boxed for easy copy:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-3,990,998.33\"} }\n```",
