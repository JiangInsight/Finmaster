No other \"Depreciation\" transaction is present in the data.\n\n5. **End Value Calculation:**  \n   - Accumulated Depreciation at period end = Initial Value + Depreciation through the period\n   - = 0.00 + 45742.50\n   - = **45742.50**\n\n6. **Present in Required Format:**  \n   - As per the required JSON format.\n```",
