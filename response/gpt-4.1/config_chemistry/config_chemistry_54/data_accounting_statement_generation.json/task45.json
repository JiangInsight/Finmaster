                        "content": "Let's solve step by step:\n\n## 1. What Belongs in Investing Activities?\n\nCash flows from investing activities typically include:\n- Purchase and sale of fixed assets (e.g., \"Fixed Assets Purchase\", \"Fixed Assets\", \"Plant & Equipment\", etc.)\n- Cash paid to acquire those assets or cash received from their sale\n\n**Purchases of inventory, business expenses (operating), interest, and transfers do NOT belong in investing activities.**\n\n## 2. Identify Relevant Transactions\n\nLet's search for lines that represent changes in fixed assets or tangible long-term assets.\n\nFrom your table, these lines qualify:\n### A. Initial Fixed Assets\n```\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | ... \n```\n- This looks like an opening balance, not a current period cash flow. Ignore for investing section (this is not a cash activity).\n\n### B. Fixed Assets Purchases\n\n#### 1.\n```\n| FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 230120.87 | Paid | Bank Transfer | S002 | ... | Storage Facilities4 | Storage Facilities |\n```\n#### 2.\n```\n| FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 478737.63 | Paid | Bank Transfer | S001 | ... | Chemical Production Line5 | Chemical Production Line |\n```\n#### 3. \n```\n| FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 351585.3 | Paid | Bank Transfer | S010 | ... | Processing Equipment6 | Processing Equipment |\n```\n#### 4.\n```\n| FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 386528.93 | Paid | Bank Transfer | S008 | ... | Processing Equipment7 | Processing Equipment |\n```\n\n## 3. Add up all Fixed Asset Purchases (outflows)\n\nAll are outflows (purchases). Let's sum:\n\n- Fixed Assets Purchase (Storage Facilities4):    230120.87\n- Fixed Assets Purchase (Chemical Production Line5): 478737.63\n- Fixed Assets Purchase (Processing Equipment6):   351585.3\n- Fixed Assets Purchase (Processing Equipment7):   386528.93\n\nSum:\n230,120.87  \n+478,737.63  \n+351,585.30  \n+386,528.93  \n= **1,446,972.73**\n\n## 4. Fixed Asset Sales?  \nNo entries for sales/disposals. Only purchases.\n\n## 5. Answer\n\nSo, **Net Cash Flows from Investing Activities** = **-1,446,972.73** (all outflows)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Format as Requested\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-1446972.73\"} }\n```",
