Since these are opening balance entries, each should have its own unique ID (or at least unique category + ID combo). The rows are using the same ID but for different types and amounts; this is inconsistent and more than one category (category, amount) is off.\n4. The **\"Recorded category\"** in each row is found to be different from the \"Original category\" as per invoice.\n5. **\"Recorded amount\"** for the cash deposit should be $3,000,000; for the bank deposit and fixed asset should be $5,000,000 each.\n6. All other fields are empty as per the invoice and row.\n\n**No other internal inconsistencies were observed in the rest of the rows that are explicit from invoice versus table fields.**\nIf an entry included multiple contradictory versions, only the fields that directly conflict between columns and invoice description above are listed.\n\nIf you would like to check for other categories (like in Sale/Purchase lines for arithmetic errors), please specify!",
