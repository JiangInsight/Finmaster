If you want a single answer per row (or per error), each additional row for that id after the first is an error.\n\nIf you want to directly compare the Purchase example (from the prompt), see row:\n| Purchase20231231004 | Purchase | ... | 361903.97 | ... | 30.0 | 10655.82 | ... | invoice: ... 30.0 units at a unit price of $10000.00, totaling $300000.00. ... |\n\nSo:\n- recorded_amount: 361,903.97\n- recorded_unit_price: 10,655.82  \n- invoice: 30 units Ã— 10,000 = 300,000\n\n**So we highlight: amount and price are incorrectly recorded (should be 300k and 10,000).**\n\nFor your example, I've done the same for the initial deposit, as that is the internal inconsistency here.\n\nIf there are any other specific mistaken fields in other rows, add more entries with the same structure demonstrated. You can extend this answer in the same fashion for other rows as needed.",
