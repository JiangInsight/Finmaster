**Expense20240101001 (row mismatch):**\n   - There are two entries for this id that are both \"Sales Expenses\" but with different preparers and amounts. According to the more reliable invoice field and cross-checking other rows and patterns, the \"Sales Expenses\" should have 44699.56 & 49449.08 as amounts (prepared by Supervisor), and the \"Administrative Expenses\" should have 8009.30 (prepared by Senior Staff). The error is an accidental category switch and preparer mismatch between \"Administrative\" and \"Sales\" for 44699.56 and 8009.3.\n\n2. **Interest20240125025:**\n   - The invoice says it is 13.31 and Unpaid, but the transaction is recorded as 15.77 and Paid, so both amount and status are inconsistent.\n\n3. **Expense20240130001:**\n   - The invoice reads the amount is 32705.96 and status paid, but the record is 37712.10 and Unpaid. As per the example, both amount and paid/unpaid status are inconsistent.\n\n**No inconsistencies were found for the rest, as invoice and table values match.**",
