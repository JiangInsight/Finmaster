mapping (based on totals and common business logic), but fields are switched in the recorded fields.\n- For example, `Expense20240101001` has one row with \"Sales Expenses\" ($44699.56, prepared by Supervisor) and another row with \"Administrative Expenses\" ($8009.30, prepared by Senior Staff), but the invoice text suggests these should be swapped (matching amount and preparer to the correct category).\n- Similarly in `Expense20240102001`, mapping needs to be swapped for categories and amounts between \"Administrative Expenses\" and \"Sales Expenses\".\n- The sale example on `Sale20240113027` shows mismatched date, quantity, unit price, and amount compared to the invoice; the correct values are taken from the more reliable invoice field.\n- Entries without real mismatches, or simply where the only issue is a redundant row with same info, are not listed above.\n- Only actual mismatches are included; e.g. many \"Interest Receivables\" or \"Transfer\" entries with negative/strange values are not mismatches by the invoice, just possibly odd data.",
