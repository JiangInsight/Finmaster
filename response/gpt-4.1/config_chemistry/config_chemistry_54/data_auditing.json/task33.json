The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $1339.90, leading to a total amount due of $25458.08. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n- But the recorded values for this id are:\n  - category: \"Sales Expenses\" (should be \"Sale\")\n  - date: \"2024-02-06\" (should be \"2024-01-09\")\n  - amount: 33362.7 (should be 26797.98)\n  - price/unit: 10743.3 (should be 13398.99)\n  - tax: 24070.41 (should be 1339.9)\n- All other fields either match or are missing in both.\n- Therefore, the corrected solution reflects these mismatches and estimated correct values from the reliable invoice field.",
