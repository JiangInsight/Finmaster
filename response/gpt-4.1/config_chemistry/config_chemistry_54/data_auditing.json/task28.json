The sum of \"amounts\" is 3000000 + 5000000 + 5000000 = 13,000,000, while the actual capital introduced should be 8,000,000 (Cash 3M + Bank 5M, with purchases of Fixed Assets from this capital). The duplication and overlap in recorded category and amounts signals an internal inconsistency; the capital should only be entered once, then allocated to cash/bank and fixed assets, not duplicated.\n   - **Best estimate:** Amount allocated to Fixed Assets and the Cash deposit and Bank deposit are all sub-entries of a single capital-injection event, with 3m to cash and 5m to bank, and 5m used to purchase Fixed Assets.\n\n2. **Purchase20231231001** — This entry matches accurately; no internal inconsistency found.\n\n3. **Purchase20231231010** — The invoice says: \"consisting of 17.0 units at a unit price of $100000.00, totaling $1700000.00\", date \"2023-12-31\". The recorded row says amount=1976998.93 (which is 17 x 92592.21 ≈ 1574067.57, doesn't match), unit price = 92592.21, and date = \"2024-01-24\". These don't match the reliable values in the invoice.\n   - **Best estimate:** Use invoice date (2023-12-31), unit price (100000.0), and amount (1700000.0) per 17 x 100000.\n\n**Other entries** (Spot checks):\n- All Sales and Purchase transactions: quantities, unit prices, and amounts match the narration in their invoices.\n- All expense entries: categories, amounts, and payment methods match narrations.\n- All Interest Receivables: amounts and methods match narrations.\n- No other obvious mismatches in cost amounts, tax amounts, or dates were found.\n\nThus, only Initial20231231001 (multi-entry confusion) and Purchase20231231010 (amount, unit price, date mismatch) require correction per your instructions.",
