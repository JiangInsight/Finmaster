of data for the same ID with mismatched categories and amounts. According to the invoices (which are considered more reliable), there are records for \"Cash deposit\" with 3,000,000 and \"Bank deposit\"/\"Fixed Assets\" with 5,000,000. So, the table is internally inconsistent for both the `category` and `amount` fields.\n- For `Expense20240101001`, the category/preparer records for Sales/Administrative Expenses do not match up with the amounts shown in the invoiceâ€”likely the invoice is correct (see descriptions), so the tabular data is inconsistent.\n- For all repeated `id`s (same transaction), if any major fields (type/category/amount/payment/receipt_status, etc.) conflict between rows, they're likely due to copying or data entry errors.\n\n**Note:** \n- Where the tabular entry matches the more formal invoice field, no inconsistency is noted (\"OK\") as in some of the above.\n- Other transactions in your data are fine and have no specific inconsistency according to the provided invoice field.\n- If you want all individual conflicts exhaustively (for every entry with duplicated IDs and mismatched details) let me know.",
