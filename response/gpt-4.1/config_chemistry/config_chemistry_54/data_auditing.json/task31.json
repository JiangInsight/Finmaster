The cost amount for this transaction was $50000.00, with a tax amount of $3000.20, leading to a total amount due of $57003.90. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- However, in the transaction entry:\n  - recorded_quantity = 6.0 (should be 5.0)\n  - recorded_unit_price = 10324.50 (should be 12000.82)\n  - recorded_amount = 72038.67 (should be 60004.10)\n  - recorded_tax_amount = 57672.77 (should be 3000.20)\n- The most reliable field is the invoice, which matches the pattern of other sales, so the estimate comes from the invoice.\n- No evidence of a mis-categorization/date/status/approver/preparer/etc.\n- Summing up, several numerical fields are inconsistent and the solution matches the template provided.\n",
