For initialization/opening entries, each id should only refer to one transaction entry. This is an internal inconsistency.\n2. **Purchase20231231001**: Appears consistent—fields all match; included for completeness.\n3. **Sale20240102003**: In the table, payment_method shows empty, but the invoice text says \"cash\" (\"received as cash\"). \n4. **Expense20240117001**: The `payment_method` is recorded as \"Account Payable\", but the invoice and context elsewhere indicate it should be \"Cash\"—this matches the prior example and should be flagged as an error.\n\nIf you need all other inconsistencies found (or a deeper sweep for every single field discrepancy), let me know!",
