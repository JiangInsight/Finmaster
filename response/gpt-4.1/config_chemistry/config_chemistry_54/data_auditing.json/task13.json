This is an internal inconsistency.\n\n2. **Tax amount mismatch:**  \n   - The \"invoice\" field states a tax amount of 6742.10 (typical for this size of a sale).\n   - The recorded_tax_amount is 118464.73, which is __absurdly high and clearly a data entry error__ for a transaction of 134,841.90 total.\n   - The tax in the invoice field is much more plausible, so the correct tax is 6742.10.\n\n3. **Other fields:**  \n   - The other fields (date, payment status, etc.) are either matching, not present, or cannot be reliably verified against the invoice field (as invoice only discusses type, quantities, amounts, tax, and receive method, etc.), so only the \"category\" and \"tax\" are relevant for correction here.\n",
