Based on patterns, the correct receive method should be \"Cash\".\n- All other fields in this entry are consistent with the invoice.\n- No other internal inconsistencies or errors between recorded fields and the reliable invoice are detected in the rest of the entries provided in this extract. (If the task expects a list, render this as a JSON array. If only per-case, this one is the only error.)",
