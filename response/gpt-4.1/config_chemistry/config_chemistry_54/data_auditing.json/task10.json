The invoice supports both a cash and bank deposit on Dec 31, 2023. Most likely, 3000000.0 is the cash portion, 5000000.0 is the bank portion, but having 'Initial20231231001' as the same ID for all three, with differing values, is a recording error. Each distinct initial contribution should have a unique transaction ID. So the correct recorded_amount for 'Initial20231231001' depends on the sub-type; if split, IDs should be: 'Initial20231231001-Cash', 'Initial20231231001-Bank', etc., with values matching the sub-type as in the invoice.\"]\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240121044\",\n    \"Incorrect field(s)\": [\"recorded_profit\"],\n    \"Recorded value(s)\": [\"1631.28\"],\n    \"Best estimate of correct value(s)\": [\"1720.95\"]\n  }\n]}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n#### 1. **Initial20231231001**\n- The same transaction ID is used for three entries: Cash deposit ($3,000,000), Bank deposit ($5,000,000), and Fixed Assets ($5,000,000).\n- The invoice text matches each 'recorded_type' and 'recorded_amount', but using the SAME transaction ID for different types is an internal consistency error.\n- Each distinct initial type should use a unique transaction ID or a suffix to differentiate (e.g., Initial20231231001A, Initial20231231001B, etc.).\n- So, the error is in **recorded_amount** field for the ID 'Initial20231231001', because the same ID is used with mutually exclusive amounts.\n- Correct value should be unique to each type; or more accurately, the IDs should be split.\n\n#### 2. **Sale20240121044**\n- Invoice says: Sale of 1 unit at $11,720.95/unit = $11,720.95. Cost amount is $10,000.00.\n- Recorded profit: $1,631.28.\n    * Profit should be: $11,720.95 (sales) - $10,000.00 (cost) = $1,720.95.\n- Discrepancy: recorded $1,631.28 vs actual $1,720.95.\n- The correct profit is $1,720.95 according to the invoice (which is considered reliable).\n\n---\n\nOther transaction rows do NOT have internal inconsistencies or field-data errors that can be inferred from their own row and the supported invoice text. \n\n#### Extra note:\n- There are some interest receivable entries with negative values (e.g., -31.19, -92.15), but the invoice just repeats the value as issued. This is unusual but not strictly an inconsistency between fields in the row (it would be a point for broader audit review).\n\n---\n\n**Thus, only the above two issues are clear per the task instructions.**",
