In the income statement, the line \"Tax Expense\" has the value 287762.05. The same value can be found in \"Taxes Payable\" as the ending amount in the balance sheet and in the cash flow item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\". Consistent with accounting standards and the instructions, the \"Tax Expense\" in the income statement (287762.05) is the total amount of tax for the period.",
