This is measured by the increase in \"Accounts Payable.\"\n- From the balance sheet: Accounts Payable increased from 0.00 (2023-12-31) to 450,000.00 (2024-01-29).\n- This is also confirmed by the cash flow statement: \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is 450,000.00 for the period.\n- Therefore, the addition is 450,000.00.",
