Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n- Formula: **Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Owner’s Equity**\n- From the balance sheet (end amounts):\n  - Total Liabilities = 737,762.05\n  - Owner’s Equity = 11,647,620.37\n\nSo,\nDebt to Equity = 737,762.05 / 11,647,620.37 ≈ **0.06**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n- Formula: **Net Profit Margin = Net Profit / Revenue × 100%**\n- From the income statement:\n  - Net Profit = -1,352,379.63\n  - Revenue (Main Business Revenue) = 5,755,241.17\n\nNet Profit Margin = (-1,352,379.63 / 5,755,241.17) × 100% ≈ **-23.50%**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n\n- Formula: **ROA = Net Profit / Average Total Assets × 100%**\n- Net Profit = -1,352,379.63\n- Total Assets (start) = 13,000,000.00\n- Total Assets (end) = 12,385,382.42\n\nAverage Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 12,385,382.42) / 2 = 12,692,691.21\n\nROA = (-1,352,379.63 / 12,692,691.21) × 100% ≈ **-10.92%**\n\n---\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n- Formula: **AR Turnover = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable**\n- Usually, assume all sales on credit unless info given.\n- Net Sales = 5,755,241.17 (from Revenue)\n- Accounts Receivable (beginning) = 0.00\n- Accounts Receivable (end) = 1,604,015.21\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable = (0.00 + 1,604,015.21)/2 = 802,007.61\n\nAR Turnover = 5,755,241.17 / 802,007.61 ≈ **7.18**\n\nBut in the EXAMPLE, the similar calculation was done with a slightly different denominator (possibly using only end AR). For consistency with standard practice and the example: Let's use the average AR.\n\nBut look at the example (where Avg AR = 0 + 2,429,482.13 / 2 = 1,214,741.065; their calculation: 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 = 4.47). So our calculation above is correct.\n\nSo, **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio ≈ 7.18**\n\nBut the cash flow statement shows (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable of -1,604,015.21, which matches exactly with the ending AR on balance sheet (so beginning was 0). Thus, average AR is correct as above.\n\nBUT – In your provided example, the AR turnover was calculated as 4.47 for:  \nNet sales = 5,431,018.59  \nAvg AR = (0 + 2,429,482.13) / 2 = 1,214,741.065  \nSo 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 = 4.47\n\nFor this question:  \nNet sales = 5,755,241.17  \nAvg AR = (0 + 1,604,015.21) / 2 = 802,007.605  \n5,755,241.17 / 802,007.605 = 7.18\n\n**So the calculated AR Turnover Ratio is 7.18**\n\nHowever, you wrote \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: '4.21' \" in your first solution.\nActually, 5,755,241.17 / 1,604,015.21 = 3.59 (if using just period end AR), which is not matching.  \nDouble checking: Example used average AR, so the result above is valid.\n\nSo, the correct value is **7.18**\n\n---\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.06\",\n  \"Net Profit Margin\": \"-23.50%\",\n  \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"-10.92%\",\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"7.18\"\n}}\n```",
