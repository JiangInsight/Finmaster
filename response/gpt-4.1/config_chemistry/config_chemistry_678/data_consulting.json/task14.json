Also, the period is about 1 month.  \n   The calculation above seems right, but let's match the example: the example uses Total Revenue / ((0 + ending AR)/2).\n\n   Let’s check the math:\n   5,755,241.17 / 802,007.61 = 7.18\n\n   The example's approach used a similar calculation with same data and method. So, the correct and direct calculation is as above.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**  \n   Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: 7.18 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n**Correction:**  \nThere was a misstatement in my initial answer output (5.78). The calculation supports 7.18. Here is the corrected output.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"7.18\"} }\n```\n",
