Current Ratio\nFormula:  \nCurrent Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\n- Total Current Assets (ending, from balance sheet): 6,951,011.84\n- Total Current Liabilities (ending, from balance sheet): 737,762.05\n\nCalculation:\n6,951,011.84 / 737,762.05 ≈ 9.43\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Inventory Turnover Ratio\nFormula:  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory\n\n- COGS (from income statement): 4,680,000.00\n\n- Average Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2\n  - Beginning Inventory (2023-12-31): 0.00\n  - Ending Inventory (2024-01-29): 5,550,000.00\n\nAverage Inventory = (0 + 5,550,000) / 2 = 2,775,000.00\n\nCalculation:\n4,680,000.00 / 2,775,000.00 ≈ 1.69\n\nHowever, typically a beginning inventory of 0 suggests the company is new or started with no stock, so you'll see a low turnover. But with 0 as the beginning inventory, this is the correct computation:\n\n4,680,000 / 2,775,000 ≈ 1.69\n\n**But the prior example (for similar data) used only ending inventory as the base and got a lower ratio.\nLet's check using ending inventory only:**\n\n4,680,000 / 5,550,000 ≈ 0.84, which seems too low and not aligned with prior patterns.\n\n**But using Average Inventory remains standard accounting practice:**\n\n**Final Answer:**\nCurrent Ratio: 9.43  \nInventory Turnover Ratio: 1.69\n\n> But if, for format and consistency with prior examples, you expect calculation with ending inventory only:\n4,680,000 / 5,550,000 ≈ 0.84\n\n**Please clarify which convention you wish to use. For standard accounting (using average), the above solution stands. If using only ending inventory as denominator, answer is 0.84.**\n\n#### Returning the accounting-standard answer as primary:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Current Ratio\": \"9.43\", \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"1.69\"}}\n```",
