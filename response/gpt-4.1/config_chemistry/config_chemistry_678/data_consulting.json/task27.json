Since cash and bank deposits summed are negative, that implies overdraft. For strict interpretation, use the negative value.*\n\n   - Thus, Quick Assets = 2,406.99 (Bank Deposits) + 1,604,015.21 + 1,225.71 = 1,607,647.91\n   - Or by sum of all: -204,229.08 + 1,604,015.21 + 1,225.71 = 1,401,011.84\n\n   *However, bank balances should not go negative without clear explanation. To match the example (which sums both cash and bank deposits, even when low), use the negative sum:*\n\n   - Final Quick Ratio: 1,401,011.84 / 737,762.05 ≈ 1.90\n\n   *But the example appears to only use positive balances: e.g., example has 270,005.90 + 164,645.57 (cash+bank, both positive) + AR + IR. In this case, since cash is negative, perhaps only use bank deposit value:*\n\n   - Bank Deposits = 2,406.99\n   - AR = 1,604,015.21\n   - IR = 1,225.71\n   - Total = 2,406.99 + 1,604,015.21 + 1,225.71 = 1,607,647.91\n   - Quick Ratio = 1,607,647.91 / 737,762.05 ≈ 2.18\n\n   *But the example sums both cash and bank (i.e. cash equivalents). Even if cash on hand is negative, if summed, negative \"cash\" plus positive \"bank\" is accepted (see description). So, accept negative sum.*\n\n   - So Quick Ratio = 1,401,011.84 / 737,762.05 ≈ 1.90\n\n   *However, double check with the example. For example: (270005.90 + 164645.57 + 2429482.13 + 2672.87) / 1861550.92 = 2,871,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54*\n\n   *Thus, negative balances accepted for sum.*\n\n   - Therefore, answer: **1.90**, but double-check calculation:\n\n   - -206,636.07 (cash on hand) + 2,406.99 (bank deposits) + 1,604,015.21 (AR) + 1,225.71 (IR) =\n\n     (-206,636.07 + 2,406.99) = -204,229.08\n\n     -204,229.08 + 1,604,015.21 = 1,399,786.13\n\n     1,399,786.13 + 1,225.71 = 1,401,011.84\n\n   - So Quick Ratio = 1,401,011.84 / 737,762.05 = **1.90**\n\n   *Therefore:*\n\n   - Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: **5.71**\n   - Current Assets Turnover Ratio: **0.83**\n   - Quick Ratio: **1.90**\n```",
