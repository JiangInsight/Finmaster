If expected as a positive ratio, we can present it as zero, but the computation is clear.\n\n**Final Answer:** Since negative cash is unusual but can happen (e.g., overdraft), and the calculation for the ratio is typically made with whatever actual cash balance remains, including negative if that's the case.\n\n**So:**\n- **Calculated value:** -0.28\n- **But per conventions and your example formatting, if strictly positive or zero required:** 0.00 (since company has no actual positive cash to cover current debt).\n\nBut to be precise, the calculated number is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"-0.28\"} }\n```\n\nIf you prefer to cut off at zero:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"0.00\"} }\n```\n\n**Best answer following your format and the real data:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"-0.28\"} }\n```",
