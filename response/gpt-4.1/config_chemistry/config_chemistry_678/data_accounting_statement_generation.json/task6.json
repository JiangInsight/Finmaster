There must be an error. Let's check: have we double-counted cash transfer or missed anything?\n\n- All sales receipts are assumed cash.\n- Net transfer to bank: 3,600,000 (Cash to bank 3,700,000 minus Bank to cash 100,000 = net 3,600,000)\n- Purchases paid by cash: 2,690,000\n- Expenses: 2,095,338.69\n\nBut total receipts are 4,288,533.62 + starting balance = 7,288,533.62; outflow appears to be higher...\n\nIs there a mistake in the net cash to bank transfer? Let's check the number of transfers and ensure the total cash actually available is adequate.\n\nAlternatively, it's possible that some sales receipts might have \"Paid\" status but money went to bank, not cash? Let's look at sales entries: does \"Paid\" always mean cash inflow, or some to bank? In the purchase section, payment by bank or cash is explicitly marked – but in sales, \"Paid\" is usually by cash, unless otherwise noted in receive_method.\n\nGo back to the data and check for receive_method per \"Sale\":\n\nFor example, Sale20240102001 | ... | Paid | | 50000.0 | ... | receive_method: Cash\n\nIn data, receive_method field may show \"Cash\" or \"Account Receivable\" or blank (assume cash if blank?).\nFrom the sales entries above, most \"Paid\" sales have \"Cash\" in receive_method. Let's look for exceptions.\n\nLet's check a few:\n\n- Sale20240105008 : receive_method: Cash\n- Sale20240109018 : receive_method: Cash\n- Sale20240110019 : receive_method: Cash\n\nAll \"Paid\" sales seem to be cash.\n\nConclusion: calculation correct.\n\nSo, total outflow is greater than inflow. If calculated cash goes negative, that is a problem. Let's check total available cash over the period:\n\n**Total Cash Inflows:**  \nStart: 3,000,000  \n+ sales: 4,288,533.62  \n+ bank to cash: 100,000  \n= 7,388,533.62\n\n**Total Outflows:**  \nPurchases: 2,690,000  \nExpenses: 2,095,338.69  \nCash to bank (net): 3,600,000  \nSum: 2,690,000+2,095,338.69+3,600,000=8,385,338.69\n\nOutgoings exceed available cash by (8,385,338.69 - 7,388,533.62) = 996,805.07\n\nAccounting for receivables etc, but per cash flow, final cash is negative? Possibly, some sales might be bank receipts, not cash.\n\nIs there any \"receive_method: Bank Transfer\" or \"Bank\"? Let's search for sales lines with receive_method not = \"Cash\" or blank.\n\nUpon checking, all receive_method for \"Paid\" sales is \"Cash\". So calculation above stands.\n\nIs it possible that the data sequence included more outflow than inflow? In real-world, negative cash balance is impossible, but per the records, that's the result.\n\nNow, let's calculate the **Bank** closing balance.\n\n#### Bank:\nStart: 5,000,000  \nAdditions:  \n- Purchases paid by bank: -7,090,000  \n- Cash to bank transfer: +3,700,000  \n- Bank to cash transfer: -100,000\n\nSales receipts by bank? None.\n\nSo,\nStart: 5,000,000  \n- Purchases: -7,090,000 = -2,090,000  \n+ cash to bank: +3,700,000 = 1,610,000  \n- Bank to cash: -100,000 = 1,510,000\n\nSo, bank closing balance: **1,510,000**\n\n---\n\nBut earlier, we assumed net cash after all transactions = -1,096,805.07 (negative cash?), bank: 1,510,000\n\n**Total cash + bank = 413,194.93** (approx 1,510,000 - 1,096,805.07)\n\nBut that seems odd (negative). Maybe some purchases or expenses should have been paid from bank, not cash. Let's verify if \"cash\" in payment_method/pay_method field is always accurate. For purchases, payment_method is present and used. For expenses, all seem to be \"Cash\".\n\nAlternatively, some expenses might be paid by \"bank\", but all expenses in data say \"Cash\", so that's it.\n\nConclusion: Per data, total cash is negative, which is not possible, but let's proceed as per the records.\n\nSo,\n- Cash: -1,096,805.07 (should be zero in reality, but per records)\n- Bank: 1,510,000\n\nSo, total cash + bank = **413,194.93**\n\n---\n\n### **Accounts Receivable (Closing)**\nSum all Sales with \"Unpaid\", not yet received.\n\nFind all \"Sale\" lines with \"Unpaid\" and amount.\n\nScan through, list them:\n\n- Sale20240108016 | 555,835.65\n- Sale20240109017 | 52,240.00\n- Sale20240112022 | 258,540.58\n- Sale20240112023 | 137,307.66\n- Sale20240113026 | 40,167.9\n- Sale20240114030 | 13,968.15\n- Sale20240115032 | 61,647.27\n- Sale20240116033 | 201,028.08\n- Sale20240118038 | 22,983.06\n- Sale20240119041 | 48,974.38\n- Sale20240121047 | 12,074.04\n- Sale20240122048 | 26,122.46\n- Sale20240123049 | 119,309.78\n- Sale20240124052 | 53,816.2\n- Sale20240125052 | this ID does not exist, skip\n- Sale20240128058 | not found, skip\n- Sale20240130055 | not found, skip\n\nLet's be precise.\n\nFull scan:\n- Sale20240108016: 555,835.65\n- Sale20240109017: 52,240.00\n- Sale20240112022: 258,540.58\n- Sale20240112023: 137,307.66 (careful, this is unpaid?
