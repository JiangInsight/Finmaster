Purchases “Paid by Cash” Already Counted (in expenses)? No.  \nKeep cash purchases in their category.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Calculate Ending Cash and Bank\nLet’s build up two ledgers: \n### A. Cash ledger  \n**Starting:** 3,000,000\n\n**Inflows:**  \n+ Sales Inflows: **4,151,225.96**  \n+ Bank-to-cash transfer: **100,000**\n\n**Outflows:**  \n- Cash-purchases: **2,620,000**  \n- Expenses: **2,095,338.67**  \n- Cash-to-bank transfers: **3,000,000**\n\n#### Cash Calculation:\n> Opening: 3,000,000  \n> + 4,151,225.96  \n> + 100,000  \n> = 7,251,225.96  \n> - 2,620,000 (cash purchases)  \n> = 4,631,225.96  \n> - 2,095,338.67 (expenses)  \n> = 2,535,887.29  \n> - 3,000,000 (cash-to-bank)  \n> = **-464,112.71**  \n\nWait: Negative cash? That can’t be right! Likely an overlap or double counting.\n\nLet’s check if any expenses relate to the purchases already listed OR if the transfer pattern is off.\n\n#### Check for double-counting:\n- Are purchase cash outflows also among the expenses?\nLet’s look at purchases paid by cash. E.g., Purchase20231231006 for 220,000, etc.  \nAre these recorded also as \"Administrative Expenses\" etc?  \nNo, \"Administrative Expenses\" are monthly, purchases have \"Purchase\" in their row.\n\nSo they are separate.\n\nIs there a possibility that expenses are paid using non-cash, but all line items say “Paid | Cash”? (per data, yes)\n\nIs it possible some expenses are input-related and overlap with purchases? Maybe not.\n\n#### Are \"Transfers\" correctly counted?\nFrom above, cash to bank = 3,000,000 out  \nbank to cash = 100,000 in\n\n---\n\n### B. Bank ledger\n**Starting:** 5,000,000\n\n**Inflows:**  \n+ Cash-to-bank transfer: **3,000,000**\n\n**Outflows:**\n- Bank purchases/full outflow: **7,190,116.37**\n- Bank-to-cash transfer: **100,000**\n\nOpening: 5,000,000  \n+ 3,000,000 = 8,000,000  \n- 7,190,116.37 = 809,883.63  \n- 100,000 = 709,883.63\n\n---\n\n### C. Calculate total ending cash & cash equivalents\nEnding Cash: **-464,112.71**  \nEnding Bank: **709,883.63**\n\nEnding combined: 709,883.63 + (-464,112.71) = **245,770.92**\n\n\n---\n\n### Validate Cross-Check & Step Back\n\nGiven negative cash, perhaps some expenses are being double-counted with purchases (i.e., purchases are input purchases and expenses are also listing purchases).\n\n**Alternate Approach: Per Example**\n\nFrom examplar, only \"expenses\" are counted as cash out (not purchases).  \nSo we should NOT count purchases as cash out if they're not called \"Expense\".\n\n#### In the example, only expense types, not purchase types, are summed as outflow (see example), and only Purchases that are \"Unpaid\" affect AP, not cash.\n\n#### So correct treatment:\n\n- **Purchases**: Outflow only if \"Paid\", and method is \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\"\n- **Expenses**: Always cash out if \"Paid\".\n- **Cash transfer** between cash/bank does NOT affect total (since cash+bank considered as a group).\n- **Sales**: Only \"Paid\" sales are inflow.\n- **Interest Receivables**: Only if Paid, but all are \"Unpaid\" or \"Interest receivable\" so ignore for cash movement.\n\nNow, cash-to-bank only reallocates between cash & bank, with no effect on net total cash & cash equivalient.\n\n**So total cash-equivalent = cash+bank**\n\nSo the correct calculation is:\n\n#### Opening cash+bank: 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = **8,000,000**\n\n#### Add Sales Receipts  \n+ Paid sales: **4,151,225.96**\n\n#### Subtract Expenses (all “Paid” as out)  \n- Expenses: **2,095,338.67**\n\n#### Subtract Purchases (all “Paid” as out)  \n- Purchases: Total \"Paid\" purchases:\n    - Paid by Cash purchases (from cash lines): **2,620,000.00**\n    - Paid by Bank Transfer (from bank lines): **7,190,116.37**\n\nBut in example, only purchases which are \"Paid\" and used \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" are counted as outflows. The rest are not.\n\nBut if the cash+bank bucket is united, and all are \"Paid\", they must be outflow in total.\n\nSo sum up ALL \"Paid\" purchase, regardless of cash or bank, sum both together:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 800,000.00  \n- Purchase20231231002: 3,000,000.00  \n- Purchase20231231004: 130,000.00  \n- Purchase20231231006: 220,000.00  \n- Purchase20231231007: 80,000.00  \n- Purchase20231231009: 220,000.00  \n- Purchase20231231010: 1,500,000.00  \n- Purchase20231231011: 900,000.00  \n- Purchase20231231012: 380,000.00  \n- Purchase20231231013: 2,100,000.00  \n- FixedAsset20231231001: 480,116.37\n\nSum above:\n800,000  \n+3,000,000 = 3,800,000  \n+130,000 = 3,930,000  \n+220,000 = 4,150,000  \n+80,000 = 4,230,000  \n+220,000 = 4,450,000  \n+1,500,000 = 5,950,000  \n+900,000 = 6,850,000  \n+380,000 = 7,230,000  \n+2,100,000 = 9,330,000  \n+480,116.37 = 9,810,116.37\n\n#### **Total paid purchases and assets** = 9,810,116.37\n\nNow, total cash-to-bank and bank-to-cash transfers net out to zero (within cash equivalents), so don't include.\n\n---\n## Final Calculation\n\n**Opening:** 8,000,000.00  \n+ Sales inflows: 4,151,225.96  \n= 12,151,225.96  \n- Expenses: 2,095,338.67  \n= 10,055,887.29  \n- Paid Purchases+fixed asset: 9,810,116.37  \n= 245,770.92\n\n---\n\n### Final check: This matches the sum above using bucketed approach, considering only \"true\" cash sources and uses, and ignoring in-bucket cash transfers.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Solution:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"245770.92\"} }\n```\n",
