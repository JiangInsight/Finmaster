                        "content": "Let's break down the steps to compute \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" for the cash flow statement:\n\n## Step 1: Identify the Interest Receivable at Beginning and End\n\nWe need to identify the total Interest Receivables at the **start** and **end** of the period (i.e., Jan 1 and Jan 29).\n\nTypically, this is the sum of all 'Interest Receivables' line items, accumulated over time. This change represents the non-cash portion of interest incomeâ€”that is, how much more (or less) unpaid interest the company has at the end compared to the beginning.\n\n**Interest Receivable at Start (2024-01-01):**\n- Only one entry on 2024-01-01:\n  - 2024-01-01: 373.80\n\nSo:  \n**Opening Interest Receivable = 373.80**\n\n---\n\n**Interest Receivable at End (2024-01-29):**\n- Last entry: 2024-01-29: 0.21422211\n\nBut -- recall: \"Interest Receivable\" is cumulative. For the cash flow statement, we want the sum of all changes in this account from 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-29, meaning, what is the CREDIT balance (i.e., total receivable) at the end vs. the beginning.\n\nBut from the data, it looks like each 'Interest Receivables' transaction is independent and reports the **additional receivable that day** (not the running total). Thus:\n\n- Interest Receivable at beginning: 373.80 (from Jan 1)\n- Add all interest receivable changes (Jan 2 - Jan 29):\n\nLet's sum all 'Interest Receivables' line amounts from 2024-01-02 to 2024-01-29.\n\n#### Find all Interest Receivables lines:\n\n- 2024-01-01: 373.80  (First day opening)\n- 2024-01-02: 106.80\n- 2024-01-03: 106.80\n- 2024-01-04: 95.23\n- 2024-01-05: 95.23\n- 2024-01-06: 95.23\n- 2024-01-07: 95.23\n- 2024-01-08: 61.41\n- 2024-01-09: 61.41\n- 2024-01-10: -18.69\n- 2024-01-11: -54.29\n- 2024-01-12: -27.59\n- 2024-01-13: 16.91\n- 2024-01-14: 16.91\n- 2024-01-15: 16.91\n- 2024-01-16: 16.91\n- 2024-01-17: 16.91\n- 2024-01-18: 16.91\n- 2024-01-19: 16.91\n- 2024-01-20: 16.91\n- 2024-01-21: 16.91\n- 2024-01-22: 16.91\n- 2024-01-23: 16.91\n- 2024-01-24: 16.91\n- 2024-01-25: 16.91\n- 2024-01-26: 0.87964307\n- 2024-01-27: 2.65964307\n- 2024-01-28: 11.55964307\n- 2024-01-29: 0.21422211\n\n**Sum only from Jan 2 to Jan 29 (since Jan 1's value is opening):**\n\nLet's make the list of all day changes:\n\n| Date        | Amount           |\n|-------------|-----------------|\n| 2024-01-02  | 106.80          |\n| 2024-01-03  | 106.80          |\n| 2024-01-04  | 95.23           |\n| 2024-01-05  | 95.23           |\n| 2024-01-06  | 95.23           |\n| 2024-01-07  | 95.23           |\n| 2024-01-08  | 61.41           |\n| 2024-01-09  | 61.41           |\n| 2024-01-10  | -18.69          |\n| 2024-01-11  | -54.29          |\n| 2024-01-12  | -27.59          |\n| 2024-01-13  | 16.91           |\n| 2024-01-14  | 16.91           |\n| 2024-01-15  | 16.91           |\n| 2024-01-16  | 16.91           |\n| 2024-01-17  | 16.91           |\n| 2024-01-18  | 16.91           |\n| 2024-01-19  | 16.91           |\n| 2024-01-20  | 16.91           |\n| 2024-01-21  | 16.91           |\n| 2024-01-22  | 16.91           |\n| 2024-01-23  | 16.91           |\n| 2024-01-24  | 16.91           |\n| 2024-01-25  | 16.91           |\n| 2024-01-26  | 0.87964307      |\n| 2024-01-27  | 2.65964307      |\n| 2024-01-28  | 11.55964307     |\n| 2024-01-29  | 0.21422211      |\n\nLet's add them up step by step.\n\n#### Sum the positive and negative values.\n\nLet's first sum from Jan 2 to Jan 9 (through the positive values):\n\n- 106.80 + 106.80 = 213.60\n- +95.23 = 308.83\n- +95.23 = 404.06\n- +95.23 = 499.29\n- +95.23 = 594.52\n- +61.41 = 655.93\n- +61.41 = 717.34\n\nSo: Jan 2 - Jan 9: 717.34\n\nNow the next are negative:\n\n- -18.69 (Jan 10) = 698.65\n- -54.29 (Jan 11) = 644.36\n- -27.59 (Jan 12) = 616.77\n\nNow, add the next block (every entry from Jan 13 is +16.91, except new values at Jan 26/27/28/29):\n\nJan 13 to Jan 25: All exactly +16.91 per day, from Jan 13-25 inclusive.\n\nFrom Jan 13 to Jan 25: That's (Jan 25 - Jan 13 + 1) = 13 days.\n\n13 * 16.91 = 219.83\n\nSo add to above:\n\n616.77 + 219.83 = 836.60\n\nNow check Jan 26/27/28/29:\n\n- Jan 26: +0.87964307 = 837.47964307\n- Jan 27: +2.65964307 = 840.13928614\n- Jan 28: +11.55964307 = 851.69892921\n- Jan 29: +0.21422211 = **851.91315132**\n\n## Step 2: Compute the Increase\n\nBut what is requested is the \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" -- which is **OPENING - CLOSING** (i.e., a positive number means a decrease in receivable, negative means an increase).\n\nBut which are the correct open/close values? Let's clarify:\n\n- Opening (Jan 1): 373.80\n- During year, you **increase** the Interest Receivable (i.e., accrue more), by sum of all new entries (Jan 2-29): 851.91315132\n\nSo, at end of period, your total Interest Receivable balance is:\n- Closing: 373.80 + 851.91315132 = **1225.71315132**\n\nBut for cash flow purposes, the change is\n- (Opening) - (Closing) = 373.80 - 1225.71315132 = **-851.91315132**\n\nBut, in the examples and in accounting, what is reported is the increase (if positive, with bracket), decrease (if negative, no bracket).\n\nBUT, most cash flow statements report it as:\n- (Increase) in Interest Receivable, so if the interest receivable account increases, it's a deduction from cash flow (i.e., increase, bracketed); if it decreases, it's an addition.\n\nSo, finally:\n\n- (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable = **Opening - Closing**\n- = **373.80 - 1225.71315132 = -851.91**\n\n(Rounded to 2 decimal places.)\n\n## Step 3: Present in Required Format\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-851.91\"} }\n```\n## Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-851.91\"} }\n```",
