includes:\n- **Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period**  \n  - Initial deposits: Cash deposit (3,000,000.0), Bank deposit (5,000,000.0)\n- **Add: Cash received from operating activities**  \n  - Sales (\"Paid\" by Cash): Add\n- **Less: Cash paid for purchases (paid purchases only!)**  \n  - Purchases marked \"Paid\" (Cash/Bank Transfer): Subtract\n- **Less: Cash paid for expenses (paid by Cash)**  \n  - All Administrative, Sales, Financial Expenses marked \"Paid\" and \"Cash\"\n- **Less: Acquisition of fixed assets (when paid by cash/bank)**  \n  - Fixed Assets Purchase Paid (Bank Transfer)\n- **Note:** Ignore \"Interest Receivables\" (not cash)\n- **Transfers between cash and bank:** Cancel each other, as they're within total cash equivalents.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Beginning cash and cash equivalents:**\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Cash equivalents at beginning: **8,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Add: Cash received from operating activities (\"Sales\", Paid, Cash):**\nFrom the data, for each Sale record:\n- If \"Paid\" and receive_method is \"Cash\", **add amount**\n- If \"Paid\" and receive_method is empty (likely Cash), **add amount**\n- Ignore \"Unpaid\"\n\nLet's scan and sum all sales, \"Paid\", and where paid by cash or receive_method is blank.\n\n### List Every Sale Line (with Paid):\n\n| id                | type |
