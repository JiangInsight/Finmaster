Find the \"Initial Value\" of Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\n\nThe initial value is calculated as at the opening date, i.e., the totals of all assets at the start since in double-entry accounting:\n**Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity ⇒ Liabilities + Owner's Equity = Total Assets**\n\nFrom the initial records:\n\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00\n\nSum:\n```\nInitial Assets = 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 13,000,000.00\n```\nSo,\n```\nTotal Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value = 13,000,000.00\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Find the \"End Value\" of Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\n\nThe end amount is equal to total assets at the close, so we need to add up all ending assets:\n- Cash (Ending)\n- Bank (Ending)\n- All receivables (customers, interest)\n- Inventory (inventory on hand)\n- Fixed Assets (net of depreciation and additions)\n\n### Key Steps:\n- Start with initial balances.\n- Add cash inflows (Sales, Interest, etc.)\n- Subtract cash outflows (Purchases, Expenses, etc.)\n- Add bank inflows/outflows similarly.\n- Watch out for transfers (bank <-> cash, etc.)\n- Add up all receivables (Sales on credit, Unpaid interest, etc.)\n- Compute ending fixed assets.\n\n---\n\n### A. Bank and Cash Handling (Transfers)\nMany \"Transfer\" records are merely inflows and outflows between bank and cash and do not affect total assets.\n\n---\n\n### B. Purchases (Inventory/Assets)\nPurchases increase inventory or fixed assets, but the total assets remain the same (cash, bank, accounts payable, or inventory/fixed assets).\n\n---\n\n### C. Sales (Cash or Account Receivables)\nFor sales:\n- If \"Paid\" → cash received.\n- If \"Unpaid\" → account receivable.\n- Remove the cost from inventory, add profit to retained earnings.\n\n---\n\n### D. Expenses\nReduce cash.\n\n---\n\n### E. Fixed Assets\n- Add the purchase (\"Fixed Assets Purchase\") to fixed assets.\n- Deduct depreciation.\n\n---\n\n### F. Receivables\nInclude any unpaid interest receivable at period end.\n\n---\n\n### G. Inventory Balance\nSum up all purchasing quantities/cost, less all sold inventories (cost).\n\n---\n\n## Calculation Table\n\n### Starting Totals\n\n- Cash: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank: 5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00\n\n### Purchases\nAdd all goods purchased (total inventory value). These are purchases of chemical products, and MOST are \"Paid\", so they reduce cash or bank.\n\nList of purchases (from the table, only those not \"Unpaid\"):\n\n| id                | amount    |

paid out)\n- Expenses: 1,607,649.55\n\nAdd:\n- Paid sales: +4,104,711.80\n\n(-) Fixed asset purchases: 480,116.37\n\nAdd unpaid purchase for fixed asset: 0 (was paid, comes from cash/bank)\n\nAlso subtract cash used for paid sales expenses if not included yet (already in expenses).\n\nNet bank/cash position:\n\nInitial cash/bank: 8,000,000.00\n− Purchases paid: −9,780,000.00\n− Expenses: −1,607,649.55\n− Fixed asset purchase: −480,116.37\n+ Sales received: +4,104,711.80\n\nNote: Some expenses might be paid by bank or cash, but let's treat as cash flows.\n\n8,000,000 − 9,780,000 = −1,780,000  \n− 1,607,649.55 = −3,387,649.55  \n− 480,116.37 = −3,867,765.92  \n+ 4,104,711.80 = +236,945.88\n\nSo, total cash+bank = 236,945.88\n\nBut this does not include transfers between cash and bank, which do not change total.\n\n#### Check for accounts payable:\n\nThe unpaid purchase (Purchase20231231003) was 450,000.00, so it hasn't yet left cash/bank, and it's accounted for in inventory.\n\n\n#### Add receivables:\n\nUnpaid sales: 1,604,015.21  \nInterest receivables: 1,259.52  \nAccounts payable: may require subtracting as a liability, but for the assets computation, it's already in inventory.\n\n#### Add inventory: 5,720,000.00  \n#### Add fixed assets (net): 5,434,370.58\n\nNow sum all assets:\n- Cash/bank: 236,945.88\n- Unpaid sales (Accounts Receivable): 1,604,015.21\n- Interest Receivables: 1,259.52\n- Inventory: 5,720,000.00\n- Fixed assets: 5,434,370.58\n\nTotal assets at end:\n\n236,945.88  \n+ 1,604,015.21 = 1,840,961.09  \n+ 1,259.52 = 1,842,220.61  \n+ 5,720,000 = 7,562,220.61  \n+ 5,434,370.58 = 12,996,591.19\n\n(Now, if you include the unpaid purchase of 450,000 as both an asset and a liability, that inflates both assets and liabilities—the inventory is increased, but so are payables.)\n\nBut the procedure in the prior solution would have included both.\n\n#### Add accounts payable: 450,000 as a liability in the sum.\n\nSo for double-entry, we should have:\n\nAssets = Cash/bank + AR (from sales) + Interest Receivable + Inventory (including payables) + Net Fixed Assets\n\nLiabilities/Owners equity:\n- The above total\n- Less: The accounts payable (since we've included the unpaid inventory but not yet subtracted the liability)\n\nSo, to align with the provided example and the double-entry approach, we add payables to the total \"liabilities + owner's equity\".\n\nSo:\n\n**Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value:**  \n12,996,591.19\n\nHowever, the original problem appears to sum both asset and liability sides, so your new assets should be:\n\n- Cash/Bank: 236,945.88  \n- AR: 1,604,015.21  \n- Interest Receivable: 1,259.52  \n- Inventory: 5,270,000.00 (excluding the unpaid 450K, which is offset by the payable)  \n- Net Fixed assets: 5,434,370.58  \n\nSo subtract 450,000 from inventory to avoid double counting:\n\nOriginal inventory: 5,720,000.00 − 450,000 = 5,270,000.00\n\nRecap:\n\nCash/Bank: 236,945.88  \nAR: 1,604,015.21  \nInterest Receivable: 1,259.52  \nInventory: 5,270,000.00  \nFixed assets: 5,434,370.58  \nSum up:\n\n236,945.88  \n+1,604,015.21
