Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) with the same ID but different amounts. According to the invoice (reliable), both Bank deposit and Fixed Assets are $5,000,000, but one entry in the table is $3,000,000 for Cash deposit with that same ID. This is inconsistent.\n- For each purchase or sale, cross-checking the amount by multiplying quantity and price, and comparing to the invoice text, and then matching status/method to invoice. Any mismatch in the status, method, or other fields, is captured.\n- Many purchase transactions have payment/receipt status or payment method not matching the invoice.\n- In cases where additional rows for the same ID exist (as with the \"Initial…\" rows), prefer the invoice narration as ground truth, as these are standardized and \"more reliable\" (as per instructions).\n- For each row, if the recorded amount, status, method, or personnel fields do not match the invoice or other consistent fields from the same row, they are flagged and the correct value is estimated.\n- Only rows with inconsistencies are listed; rows with fully consistent information are omitted for brevity.\n- If specific adjustments are repeated for similar inconsistencies (i.e., missing staff, status, or method not matching invoice), they are presented following the required json format.\n",
