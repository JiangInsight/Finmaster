According to the invoice field, the total for \"Cash deposit\" should be 3,000,000, \"Bank deposit\" 5,000,000, and \"Fixed Assets\" 5,000,000. However, the id is the same, so at least two rows are internally inconsistent (wrong recorded_type and/or amount).\n- For `Sale20240125054`, according to the invoice, this is for 1.0 units at $111,403.07, totaling $111,403.07, with a cost amount of $100,000.00 and tax of $5,570.15. The table, however, records 0.0 quantity, 0.0 amount, unit price incorrectly, and the date is also mismatched.\n- Only rows that correspond to the problem example (those with id conflicts and/or invoice-to-table internal mismatches) are shown. All other rows are internally consistent. \n\nIf more inconsistencies are found in specific rows that match the style of the `risk_issues` column, each would be listed as above.",
