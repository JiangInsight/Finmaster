deposit, Fixed Assets) each with a different amount (3,000,000; 5,000,000; 5,000,000). The invoice references only a \"Cash deposit\" with 3,000,000. Thus, the \"Original\" (per invoice) is Cash deposit, amount 3,000,000; the \"Bank deposit\" and \"Fixed Assets\" are not aligned.\n- For purchase and sale entries, single-invoice-per-id is assumed correct. If the payment status or paid/unpaid does not match the invoice or standard calculation based on products/unit/amount, an inconsistency is flagged.\n- For entries where a payment/receipt status is \"Paid\" but the invoice indicates \"Unpaid\" (or vice-versa), as with `Interest20240121021` and `Sale20240125053`, the value in the invoice (considered standard) is presented as \"Original\", the current entry as \"Recorded\".\n- For purchases, verified that quantity × price = amount. If they mismatch or payment method/status disagrees with invoice, flagged.\n- Multiple similar purchase entries with the same supplier, product, date and format are considered correct as long as they match the invoice and calculated totals.\n\nThis result provides the mismatched cases (the most clear errors per the task scope) in the specified JSON format.",
