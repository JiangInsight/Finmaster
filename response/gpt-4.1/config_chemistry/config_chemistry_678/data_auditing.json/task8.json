Sale20240104006\n- **Invoice:** ...a Sale, consisting of 4.0 units at a unit price of $110,345.75, totaling $441,383.00.\n- **Recorded Amount:** 515,022.02 (should be 441,383.00 as per invoice).\n- **Discrepancy:** The correct total should be 4 × 110,345.75 = 441,383.00.\n- **Tax**: From invoice: \"with a tax amount of $22,069.15\".\n\n### 2. Sale20240110016\n- **Invoice:** ...a Sale, consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $62,344.08, totaling $124,688.16.\n- **Recorded Amount:** 138,369.24 (should be 124,688.16 as per invoice).\n- **Discrepancy:** 2 × 62,344.08 = 124,688.16.\n\n### Other Rows\nAll other rows are consistent between invoice and recorded data, or at least have no detectable mismatch between reliable fields (like amount, quantity, unit price, etc). Values such as cost or tax, when present, match the calculated/invoiced figures.\n\nThus, only the two above transactions contain material inconsistencies where a field (recorded_amount) disagrees with the invoice/other fields.",
