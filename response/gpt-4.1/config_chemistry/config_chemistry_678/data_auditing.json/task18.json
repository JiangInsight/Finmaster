This likely indicates a data entry error where transaction IDs for different assets were not separated. The error is at the transaction structure level.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240127057\",\n    \"Incorrect field(s)\": \"recorded_quantity, recorded_amount, recorded_payment/receipt_status, recorded_profit\",\n    \"Recorded value(s)\": \"recorded_quantity: 1.0, recorded_amount: 23257.08, recorded_payment/receipt_status: Unpaid, recorded_profit: 5549.26\",\n    \"Best estimate (correct value)\": \"Per the invoice, this sale was for 2.0 units at $23257.08 = $46514.16, paid, with original profit 6514.16.

According to standard accounting and invoice standards, these should be recorded separately or as a composite entry per asset type, not under a single ID. The invoice splits the assets and amounts properly, but the database combines them under one ID, which is inconsistent with proper practice.\n\n- For transaction **Sale20240127057**: Directly flagged by the last column/risk_issues and confirmed by the invoice row â€” the recorded values do not match the standardized invoice which is considered reliable (quantity is halved, so is amount and profit; status is marked as unpaid whereas invoice says paid). Correction is indicated accordingly.\n\n**If you want to expand to all detected issues (including, but not limited to, cases where a negative interest receivable makes no sense based on the invoice), let me know!**",
