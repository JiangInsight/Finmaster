It should likely also be $5,000,000.00 to match the invoice total, or these represent two subcomponents for a $5,000,000.00 total.\n- But as invoices are more reliable, the row for \"Cash deposit\" with $3,000,000.00 is considered inconsistent and likely should be $5,000,000.00.\n\n**Note:** If you want each individual error for every field and all three entries in detail, please clarify, but the key error visible is the mismatch in the \"amount\" for the initial deposit transaction. If you expect all inconsistencies in the whole dataset, let me know for a full audit.",
