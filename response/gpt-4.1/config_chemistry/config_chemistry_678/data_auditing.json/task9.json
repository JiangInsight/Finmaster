There are three entries with the same id (`Initial20231231001`) but different categories and amounts. The invoice data (which is more reliable) states \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Bank deposit, totaling $5000000.00\", \"Fixed Assets, totaling $5000000.00\", and \"Cash deposit, totaling $3000000.00\". Only one initial capital entry should exist per id. This implies that at least two rows are internally inconsistent. (The handling above lists all combinations for full clarity.)\n\n2. For `Sale20240114030`, from the invoice: \"tax amount of $698.41\", but the recorded tax is `13585.94`â€”this is a clear discrepancy. The original tax (from invoice) should be `698.41`, not `13585.94`.\n\nIf you desire only unique errors per id, you can compress further, but this answer lists all combinations found.
