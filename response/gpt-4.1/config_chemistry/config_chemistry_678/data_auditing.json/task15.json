Inspect each transaction for inconsistencies between the fields and the reliable invoice field.\n2. For `Sale20240109017`, the invoice says:  \n   > an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 4.0 units at a unit price of $13060.00, totaling $52240.00.\n   *But the recorded fields state:*\n   - `recorded_type`: Purchase _(should be Sale)_\n   - `recorded_quantity`: 3.0 _(should be 4.0)_\n   - `recorded_amount`: 39180.0 _(should be 52240.0)_\n3. All other fields (unit price, cost, receive method, etc.) match.\n4. Therefore, output the inconsistencies detected with the correct (original from invoice) and incorrect (recorded) values in the requested format.",
