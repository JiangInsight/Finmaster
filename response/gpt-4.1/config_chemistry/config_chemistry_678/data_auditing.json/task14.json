Since invoices are generally reliable, having three lines with different amounts/types for the same ID is inconsistent. However, without a \"recorded\"/\"original\" mapping (all are probably equally suspect), only IDs and general inconsistency can be flagged.\n- For `Sale20240124052`: Based on the invoice (and the risk_issues field), the original should be 4 units (and \"Unpaid\"); the recorded shows 2 units (and \"Paid\"). The total should be `4*13454.05=53816.20`, but the recorded amount is `26908.10` (i.e. only 2 units). Both quantity and payment/receipt_status are inconsistent; amount as well. The correction is inferred from invoice text and calculation.\n- For other transactions, most have full agreement or no possible comparison (since only one record, or fields are clearly matching the invoice). The demonstrated approach is to only flag fields for transactions with inconsistencies. The first transaction is shown multiple timesâ€”e.g., under different categories (Cash deposit/Bank deposit/Fixed assets) with the same ID, which is an error.\n- If you need a full audit of all transactions, including values and fields, or a different structure, let me know!",
