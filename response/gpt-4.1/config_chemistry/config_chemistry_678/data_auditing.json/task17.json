So \"Recorded category\" is wrong; should be \"Interest Receivables\".\n- The receive_method is recorded as \"Account Receivable\" but, per invoice, it should be \"Interest receviable\".\n- Amount matches, as does the date and unpaid status, so no error there.\n- Other fields are either missing in both or not relevant. All other fields are left null.\n- The answer is formatted as requested in the required JSON structure.",
