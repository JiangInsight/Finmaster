The existing arrangement records three different categories under one transaction, which is incorrect.\n\n3. **Output:**\n   - All three rows are shown as internally inconsistent (because the same transaction ID is reused for three different initial account allocations).\n   - The actual content per field matches invoice, so only the \"category/type\" linked to transaction ID needs to be corrected, i.e., the transactions should have unique IDs per each type/category rather than shared.\n\nIf further inconsistencies (like calculation errors or negative taxes) are apparent in other entries, those would be detailed similarly. In this excerpt, the most apparent issue is the triplicate use of one ID for three distinct initial fund allocations. For each, the solution matches the data but highlights the actual inconsistency for correction.",
