Going through them, the only field that has a mismatch (explicitly stated) is:\n   - `Interest20240116016`  \n     The invoice says: \"The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n     But the `recorded_receive_method` is \"Cash\".\n\n    All other records in this batch appear to match. The quantities, unit prices, types, methods, status etc. all align to the invoice description or are plausible.\n\n3. **Risk issues column:**  \n   There is a warning for id `Interest20240116016` in the original risk_issues field:\n   ```python\n   [{'Original receive_method': 'Interest receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Cash', 'id': 'Interest20240116016'}]\n   ```\n   This confirms the detected inconsistency.\n\n4. **Other consistency checks:**  \n   - Amounts, unit prices, quantities multiply as expected.\n   - Approver/Preparer roles are plausible.\n   - All \"Interest Receivables\" have correct \"Interest receviable\" except for the above.\n   - No negative amounts for Purchase or Sales types (negative amount would be an error for those).\n   - Tax, cost, after-tax, profit, all match described values.\n\n**Therefore**, the only inconsistency detected is for:\n- id: `Interest20240116016`  \n  - Original receive_method (from invoice and context): 'Interest receviable'  \n  - Recorded receive_method: 'Cash'  \n\nNo other mismatches are found.\n\n**(If you want all json fields filled even if blank, please say so; otherwise output is as above.)**",
