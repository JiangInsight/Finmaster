The receive_method is \"interest receviable\", and the transaction is \"unpaid\".\n- The recorded row instead uses:  \n  - Type: \"Administrative Expenses\" (should be Interest Receivables)\n  - Date: \"2024-02-03\" (should be 2024-01-10)\n  - Amount: \"-20.69\" (should be -18.69)\n- All other fields, like payment/receipt status and receive_method, DO match.  \n- Based on provided patterns and the logic that \"invoice\" (i.e. description) is more reliable, the solution fills only the fields with inconsistencies as per the example.",
