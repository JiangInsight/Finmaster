For `Initial20231231001`, there are three rows all with different categories (`Cash deposit`, `Bank deposit`, `Fixed Assets`) and two different amounts ($3,000,000; $5,000,000), while the invoice (a reliable field) lists different categories and amounts. This reveals internal inconsistency that only one can be correctâ€”according to invoice and cross-row logic, probably the `Bank deposit` ($5,000,000) and `Fixed Assets` ($5,000,000) values are correct, but not `Cash deposit` with $3,000,000 for this id, and the cash deposit appears lower than the other two. So, at minimum, `Cash deposit` entry is likely incorrect. \n    - (For rigor, both the extra `Fixed Assets` and `Bank deposit` with same id and different values are noted as inconsistent.)\n2. For `Sale20240104007`, the invoice (original) says unit price $55,570.07 but recorded price is $62,452.4; original value should be $55,570.07.\n\nFor other transactions, no other clear field-level mismatches are indicated by the invoice (which is not always available for every detail but when available is treated as more reliable).\n\nIf you would like further details on other transactions or a broader net for smaller/other inconsistencies, please let me know!",
