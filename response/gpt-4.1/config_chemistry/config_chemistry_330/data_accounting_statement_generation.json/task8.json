What is 'Accumulated Depreciation' and How is it shown on the balance sheet?\n\n- **Accumulated Depreciation** is a contra-asset account on the balance sheet representing the total depreciation expense that has been charged against fixed assets since those assets were acquired.\n- The initial value is what it was at the start date.  \n- The end value is what it is after considering all depreciation transactions up to the end date.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Find Initial Value\n\n- Look in the \"Initial\" entries at the beginning of the data for any accumulated depreciation amount.\n- In this data, there is no line for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" in the initial balances. There are lines only for Cash, Bank, Fixed Assets, etc.\n\nSo, **Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value = 0.00**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Calculate Depreciation Recorded in the Period (the end value)\n\n- Find all transactions of type \"Depreciation\".\n- There is only one transaction:  \n  | id                      | type         | date       | amount          |  \n  |-------------------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|  \n  | Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 45765.700000000004 |\n\nSo, only one depreciation transaction has occurred in this period with an amount of **45765.70**.\n\n- There are no other \"Depreciation\" type transactions in the dataset.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Add up initial value + all depreciation recorded:\n\n- **Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value:** 0.00  \n- **Depreciation during the period:** 45765.70  \n- **Accumulated Depreciation End Value:** 0.00 + 45765.70 = **45765.70**\n\n---\n\n### 5. Format the Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"45765.70\"} }\n```",
