From the entries, it appears all other purchases are marked as \"Paid\" (so, not from this period's AP accruals), and there are no entries for actual payment of AP (i.e., 'Payment to Suppliers' with AP decreasing).\n- No explicit payment reducing AP is recorded in these transactions (all paid purchases are paid on the spot, not older AP).\n\n**Step 3: Compute the Increase of AP**\n- Since there is only one Unpaid purchase â†’ the entire 2,700,000.00 will be reflected as \"Increase in Accounts Payable\" (since no decrease by payment was made during the period).\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer**\n\nThe increase in accounts payable, calculated as new AP from purchases minus any payments made toward AP (here, none), is **2,700,000.00**.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"2700000.00\"} }\n```",
