Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**\n\nInflows: 2,696,886.46  \nOutflows: 8,926,961.83\n\n**Net cash flow from operating activities:**\n\n2,696,886.46 - 8,926,961.83 = **-6,230,075.37**\n\n---\n\nWait: But in the example, unpaid purchases were not included; only _Paid_ ones.\nConfirming in the current data: All purchases used above are \"Paid\" and not \"Unpaid\".\n\nAlso, for cash inflow, only sales marked as \"Paid\" are included.  \nMoreover, initial cash deposit and deposit to bank are opening balances, not current period cash flow.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nIt seems above matches methodology, but the difference is large compared to the example: in the example both cash inflows/outflows were much lower, but the calculations match the logic. There may be a small misapplied sum, so let's check the addition for the expenses. Let's sum the total cash outflows again in one go:\n\n**Sum of expenses (all cash \"Paid\" only):**\n\n(We'll sum each value sequentially:)\n\n1. 9416.95\n2. +32963.21 = 42380.16\n3. +37803.85 = 80184.01\n4. +27635.86 = 107819.87\n5. +39636.71 = 147456.58\n6. +28772.91 = 176229.49\n7. +46809.94 = 223039.43\n8. +8395.01 = 231434.44\n9. +21468.87 = 252903.31\n10. +10431.27 = 263334.58\n11. +29306.91 = 292641.49\n12. +33363.42 = 326004.91\n13. +38768.59 = 364773.5\n14. +5334.06 = 370107.56\n15. +46201.38 = 416308.94\n16. +41709.07 = 458018.01\n17. +39247.55 = 497265.56\n18. +38482.99 = 535748.55\n19. +37429.99 = 573178.54\n20. +21623.3 = 594801.84\n21. +25265.54 = 620067.38\n22. +30216.87 = 650284.25\n23. +20581.68 = 670865.93\n24. +17423.33 = 688289.26\n25. +7824.83 = 696114.09\n26. +8616.21 = 704730.3\n27. +49269.0 = 753999.3\n28. +42647.17 = 796646.47\n29. +45556.32 = 842202.79\n30. +37593.05 = 879795.84\n31. +17609.13 = 897404.97\n32. +11440.04 = 908845.01\n33. +49384.5 = 958229.51\n34. +47760.71 = 1,006,990.22\n35. +7159.99 = 1,014,150.21\n36. +7426.35 = 1,021,576.56\n37. +40667.19 = 1,062,243.75\n38. +49563.95 = 1,111,807.7\n39. +7991.4 = 1,119,799.1\n40. +20561.68 = 1,140,360.78\n41. +27093.82 = 1,167,454.6\n42. +21894.83 = 1,189,349.43\n43. +16206.96 = 1,205,556.39\n44. +13631.77 = 1,219,188.16\n45. +41266.68 = 1,260,454.84\n46. +36256.39 = 1,296,711.23\n47. +26422.97 = 1,323,134.2\n48. +8919.26 = 1,332,053.46\n49. +32256.58 = 1,364,310.04\n50. +7210.97 = 1,371,521.01\n51. +43350.45 = 1,414,871.46\n52. +8529.7 = 1,423,401.16\n53. +42802.24 = 1,466,203.4\n54. +24605.62 = 1,490,809.02\n55. +20175.3 = 1,510,984.32\n56. +24894.98 = 1,535,879.3\n57. +11870.08 = 1,547,749.38\n58. +17445.2 = 1,565,194.58\n59. +24962.22 = 1,590,156.8\n60. +30499.76 = 1,620,656.56\n61. +17779.19 = 1,638,435.75\n62. +21687.75 = 1,660,123.5\n63. +42547.69 = 1,702,671.19\n64. +9862.76 = 1,712,533.95\n65. +9640.73 = 1,722,174.68\n66. +28127.83 = 1,750,302.51\n67. +17731.4 = 1,768,033.91\n68. +35581.51 = 1,803,615.42\n69. +36100.51 = 1,839,715.93\n70. +7410.37 = 1,847,126.3\n71. +41472.44 = 1,888,598.74\n72. +18657.15 = 1,907,255.89\n73. +41123.52 = 1,948,379.41\n74. +9590.47 = 1,957,969.88\n75. +25267.49 = 1,983,237.37\n76. +5805.44 = 1,989,042.81\n77. +23175.71 = 2,012,218.52\n78. +6391.42 = 2,018,609.94\n79. +21505.59 = 2,040,115.53\n80. +39006.77 = 2,079,122.3\n81. +30200.35 = 2,109,322.65\n82. +34012.21 = 2,143,334.86\n83. +8766.09 = 2,152,100.95\n84. +41601.35 = 2,193,702.3\n85. +42556.4 = 2,236,258.7\n86. +14686.36 = 2,250,945.06\n87. +37906.69 = 2,288,851.75\n88. +20762.49 = 2,309,614.24\n89. +27338.59 = 2,336,952.83\n\n**Total: 2,336,952.83**\n\nThis matches the previously subtotalled amount.\n\n---\n\nSo:\n\n**Outflows = Purchases + Expenses = 6,600,000.00 + 2,336,952.83 = 8,936,952.83**\n\n**Inflows (cash sales) = 2,696,886.46**\n\n**Net cash flow from operating activities = 2,696,886.46 - 8,936,952.83 = -6,240,066.37**\n\n---\n\nBut wait, in the calibrated example, they *exclude* purchases as operating cash outflow, because inventory acquisition (if paid) is a change in working capital, but in standard direct method, purchases paid are included. For this problem, we'll *include* purchases paid because that's standard in direct method.\n\nTherefore, above total is final.\n\n**Final answer (rounded to 2 decimals):**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-6240066.37\"}}\n```\n\n**However, double-check if any initial deposit should be included:**\n- Initial cash deposit and bank deposit are opening balances (not current period cash inflow); they are ignored per example.\n\n**Any transfers?**\n- All \"Cash to bank transfer\", etc, are internal, do not affect net cash from operating activities, so excluded.\n\n**Any unpaid purchases/sales?**\n- Only PAID entries are included, per above.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-6240066.37\"}}\n```\n\nI apologize for my earlier value (was off due to a mis-sum in expenses group). This is the accurate figure based on explicit data extraction, summing, and double-checking of entries.",
