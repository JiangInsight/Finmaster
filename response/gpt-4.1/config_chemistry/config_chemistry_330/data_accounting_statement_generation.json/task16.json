In the balance sheet, it remains unchanged unless there's fresh capital injection or return of capital to owners. Normal business transactions like sales, purchases, expenses, depreciation, or transfers do **not** affect paid-in capital.\n\n2. **Initial Paid-in Capital**:\n    - Find the \"Initial\" transactions that indicate capital contribution.\n    - In the data:\n        - `Cash deposit` = 3,000,000.0\n        - `Bank deposit` = 5,000,000.0\n        - `Fixed Assets` = 5,000,000.0\n    - Sum: 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = **13,000,000.00**\n\n3. **Subsequent Activity**:\n    - All other transactions are business operations (purchases, expenses, depreciation, fixed asset buys, sales, transfers, etc.)\n    - These do **not** change paid-in capital unless thereâ€™s a new capital entry or capital withdrawal, which is **not present** in the transactions.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n    - Thus, the **Paid-in Capital End Value** is also **13,000,000.00**.\n    - There are no additional or reducing capital events throughout the period.\n\n5. **Format as Required**:\n    - As per the instruction, present initial and end value in the specified JSON.\n\n**Therefore, the solution presented above is correct.**",
