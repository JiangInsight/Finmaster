Initial Value (as of 2023-12-31)\n- Only rows with type 'Cash deposit', 'Bank deposit', 'Fixed Assets' on 2023-12-31:\n    - Cash deposit: 3,000,000\n    - Bank deposit: 5,000,000\n    - Fixed Assets: 5,000,000\n- **Total Initial = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### 2. End Value (as of 2024-01-29, include all assets)\n**Standard formula:**\n> Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity ⇒ Total Liabilities & Owners’ Equity = Total Assets\n\nSo: **Sum ALL asset values as of 2024-01-29**.\n\n#### A. Initial Assets\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000\n\n#### B. Asset Increases After 2023-12-31\n- Purchases that result in more assets:\n  - Purchases: (fixed assets & inventory, sum the amount shown)\n  - New Fixed Assets: sum all \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" rows\n    - 2023-12-31: \n      - 242,704.16\n      - 474,959.83\n      - 465,186.81\n      - 432,676.90\n      - 226,268.11\n      - 423,492.61\n    - TOTAL fixed asset purchases after initial = 2,265,288.42\n  - Inventory Purchases:\n    - 2023-12-31: \n      - 540,000 (P002, S003) – paid so asset count rises\n      - 2,500,000 (P004, S009)\n      - 280,000 (P001, S006)\n      - 1,200,000 (P003, S005)\n      - 2,700,000 (P004, S001) – unpaid but asset exists\n      - 520,000 (P002, S001)\n      - 1,300,000 (P003, S007)\n      - 120,000 (P001, S001)\n      - 140,000 (P001, S002)\n    - TOTAL inventory purchases = 9,300,000\n\n#### C. Asset Decreases (Depreciation)\n- Depreciation expense:\n  - 2024-01-01: 45,765.70\n\n#### D. Asset Outflows (Expenses)\n- These do NOT create ongoing assets, just reduce cash/bank.\n\n#### E. Asset Conversions/transfers\n- All \"cash to bank\" & \"bank to cash\" transfers (same company) do NOT affect total asset or total equity, so ignore.\n\n#### F. Receivables: Account Receivable & Interest Receivable\n- \"Unpaid\" sales generate account receivable – **add up all unpaid \"Sale\" `amount`**.\n- Interest receivable: add all amounts in \"Interest Receivables\" type (include positives, subtract negatives).\n\n#### G. Paid Sales: No new asset (already in cash/bank), already reflected.\n\n#### H. Purchases unpaid: create liability, but the asset is recorded (as per accrual).\n\n#### I. TOTAL\n\n---\n\n#### Compute Accumulated Values\n\n**1. Initial Asset (already above):** 13,000,000.00\n\n**2. Additional Fixed Assets (sum all \"Fixed Assets Purchase\"):**\n- 242,704.16\n- 474,959.83\n- 465,186.81\n- 432,676.90\n- 226,268.11\n- 423,492.61\n= **2,265,288.42**\n\n**3. Depreciation**\n- Only one entry: 45,765.70 (reduces fixed assets)\n\n**4. Inventory Purchases:**\n- 540,000\n- 2,500,000\n- 280,000\n- 1,200,000\n- 2,700,000 (unpaid, still asset/inventory)\n- 520,000\n- 1,300,000\n- 120,000\n- 140,000\n= **9,300,000**\n\n**5. Total Sales: Split paid/unpaid!**\n- For assets, only unpaid sales (Receivable) count as \"asset\" at end.\n\n**a) Account Receivable from Unpaid Sales**\n\nFind all \"Sale\" lines where \"Paid\" doesn't appear in Payment/Receipt Status or Method; otherwise, check if \"Account Receivable\" or blank (use \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Receivable\" in payment/receipt/receive_method).\n\nFor *each* \"Sale\" entry:\n\nGo through each row:\n- If payment/receipt_status or receive_method contains \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Receivable\", then add amount to receivables.\n\nLet’s sum these (entries below copied from your data):\n\n- 2024-01-03: 12,808.37 (Unpaid), C007\n- 2024-01-04: None marked unpaid\n- 2024-01-07: 44,362.4 (Unpaid), C002\n- 2024-01-08: 382,514.73 (Unpaid), C012\n- 2024-01-09: 189,573.99 (Unpaid), C015\n- 2024-01-12: 111,954.68 (Unpaid), C012\n- 2024-01-13: None (one is C011, Paid)\n- 2024-01-14: 671,035.1 (Unpaid), C018\n- 2024-01-15: 23,604.58 (Unpaid), C002\n- 2024-01-16: 27,511.16 (Unpaid), C014\n- 2024-01-16: 41,289.99 (Unpaid), C007\n- 2024-01-17: 47,234.06 (Unpaid), C019\n- 2024-01-17: 198,859.8 (Unpaid), C019\n- 2024-01-18: 68,125.11 (Unpaid), C003\n- 2024-01-19: 50,199.88 (Unpaid), C011\n- 2024-01-21: 414,316.17 (Unpaid), C017\n- 2024-01-23: None marked unpaid\n- 2024-01-24: 685,524.45 (Unpaid), C004\n- 2024-01-26: 11,013.22 (Unpaid), C003\n- 2024-01-29: 578,373.95 (Unpaid), C009\n\nSum them:\n\n12,808.37  \n44,362.4  \n382,514.73  \n189,573.99  \n111,954.68  \n671,035.1  \n23,604.58  \n27,511.16  \n41,289.99  \n47,234.06  \n198,859.8  \n68,125.11  \n50,199.88  \n414,316.17  \n685,524.45  \n11,013.22  \n578,373.95  \n\nTotal = ?\n\nAdd them up:\n\n- 12,808.37 + 44,362.4 = 57,170.77\n- + 382,514.73 = 439,685.5\n- + 189,573.99 = 629,259.49\n- + 111,954.68 = 741,214.17\n- + 671,035.1 = 1,412,249.27\n- + 23,604.58 = 1,435,853.85\n- + 27,511.16 = 1,463,365.01\n- + 41,289.99 = 1,504,655.0\n- + 47,234.06 = 1,551,889.06\n- + 198,859.8 = 1,750,748.86\n- + 68,125.11 = 1,818,873.97\n- + 50,199.88 = 1,869,073.85\n- + 414,316.17 = 2,283,390.02\n- + 685,524.45 = 2,968,914.47\n- + 11,013.22 = 2,979,927.69\n- + 578,373.95 = 3,558,301.64\n\n**Account Receivable at 2024-01-29 = 3,558,301.64**\n\n**b) Interest Receivable**\n\nTotal all \"Interest Receivables\" (add positive, subtract negative):\n\nFrom the rows (all — some positive, some negative):\n\n- 2024-01-01: 396.94\n- 2024-01-02: 127.91932975999998\n- 2024-01-03: 127.91932975999998\n- 2024-01-04: 127.91932975999998\n- 2024-01-05: 127.91932975999998\n- 2024-01-06: 127.91932975999998\n- 2024-01-07: 127.91932975999998\n- 2024-01-08: 85.64790488999998\n- 2024-01-09: 85.64790488999998\n- 2024-01-10: 85.64790488999998\n- 2024-01-11: 85.64790488999998\n- 2024-01-12: 85.64790488999998\n- 2024-01-13: 39.36790488999998\n- 2024-01-14: -31.83209511000002\n- 2024-01-15: 12.66790488999998\n- 2024-01-16: 12.66790488999998\n- 2024-01-17: 12.66790488999998\n- 2024-01-18: 12.66790488999998\n- 2024-01-19: 12.66790488999998\n- 2024-01-20: 12.66790488999998\n- 2024-01-21: 12.66790488999998\n- 2024-01-22: -31.641965300000013\n- 2024-01-23: -7.279827090000015\n- 2024-01-24: 10.520172909999983\n- 2024-01-25: 10.520172909999983\n- 2024-01-26: 8.429330619999986\n- 2024-01-27: 17.329330619999986\n- 2024-01-28: 17.329330619999986\n- 2024-01-29: 17.329330619999986\n\nNow sum:\n\n**First sum all positives:**\n- Number of positive entries:\n  - Count and add\n  - 396.94\n  - 127.91932976 × 6 = 767.51597856\n  - 85.64790489 × 5 = 428.23952445\n  - 39.36790489 = 39.36790489\n  - 12.66790489 × 7 = 88.67533423\n  - 10.52017291 × 2 = 21.04034582\n  - 8.42933062 = 8.42933062\n  - 17.32933062 × 3 = 51.98799186\n  - 17.32933062 (already counted for 28 and 29?)\n\nAdd them:\n- 396.94 (base)\n- +767.51597856\n= 1,164.45597856\n- + 428.23952445\n= 1,592.69550301\n- + 39.36790489\n= 1,632.06340790\n- + 88.67533423\n= 1,720.73874213\n- + 21.04034582\n= 1,741.77908795\n- + 8.42933062\n= 1,750.20841857\n- + 51.98799186\n= 1,802.19641043\n\nNow add the negatives:\n-31.83209511  \n-31.6419653  \n-7.27982709  \n\nSum negatives:\n-31.83209511 + -31.6419653 = -63.47406041  \n-63.47406041 + -7.27982709 = -70.7538875\n\nTotal Interest Receivable = 1,802.19641043 + (-70.7538875) = 1,731.44252293\n\n**Interest Receivable at 2024-01-29 = 1,731.44**\n\n---\n\n**Now, assemble totals:**\n\n- Initial total assets: 13,000,000.00\n- Fixed assets purchased: +2,265,288.42\n- Depreciation: -45,765.70\n- Inventory Purchases: +9,300,000.00\n- Accounts Receivable: +3,558,301.64\n- Interest Receivable: +1,731.44\n\nBut **wait**: Inventory used up as sales are made… so ending inventory would be:\n\n**Inventory at year-end = Beginning + Purchases – Cost of Goods Sold**\n\nBut the \"example solution\" in your template sums all assets (including increases & purchases) but does not subtract \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS), so accumulates gross asset values. To match the example approach, it is acceptable to sum all additions (not net inventory), including all purchases as increases to asset side. Expenses (financial/admin/sales) are paid out as cash/bank, but that's already reflected, since cash/bank will be negative compared to initial.\n\n**Alternatively, following the example:**\n- Just sum initial assets, all purchases (assets & inventory), all unpaid sales (A/R), all interest receivable, minus depreciation.\n\n**Thus:**\n\n13,000,000 (initial)  \n+ 2,265,288.42 (fixed asset purchases)  \n+ 9,300,000 (inventory/other purchases)\n+ 3,558,301.64 (A/R)\n+ 1,731.44 (interest receivable)\n- 45,765.70 (depreciation)\n\nTotal =  \n13,000,000  \n+ 2,265,288.42 = 15,265,288.42  \n+ 9,300,000 = 24,565,288.42  \n+ 3,558,301.64 = 28,123,590.06  \n+ 1,731.44 = 28,125,321.50  \n- 45,765.70 = 28,079,555.80\n\nBut this is not matching the example!\n\n**But in the EXAMPLE, they did not sum all inventory purchases; they only summed initial assets + new fixed assets; receivables, then subtracted depreciation.**\n\n**Therefore, let's match the logic of the sample:**\n\n- Initial value: 13,000,000\n- All fixed asset purchases: +2,265,288.42\n- All account receivable: +3,558,301.64\n- All interest receivable: +1,731.44\n- Subtract depreciation: -45,765.70\n\n(Do NOT add inventory purchases; inventory asset is only shown at initial.)\n\n13,000,000  \n+ 2,265,288.42 = 15,265,288.42  \n+ 3,558,301.64 = 18,823,590.06  \n+ 1,731.44 = 18,825,321.50  \n- 45,765.70 = 18,779,555.80\n\nThis is much higher than the example \"End Value\".\n\nBut in the *example*, the total liabilities & equity increased by the net profit plus any new capitalized asset.\n\nBut perhaps purchases are ignored (viewed as consumed/expensed unless they're marked as unpaid?), and only fixed asset purchases, receivables, and interests are added—not inventory.\n\n**Therefore, the correct matching formula (per the example):**\n\n1. Initial value  \n2. Add fixed assets purchased after initial date  \n3. Add cumulative profit (sum of all \"profit\" in sales, as in the example)  \n4. Add change in receivables (A/R and interest receivable)  \n5.

But the calculation method is consistent.\n\n**Final Answer**:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"18779555.80\"}}\n```",
