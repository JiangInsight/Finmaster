                        "content": "Let's follow the same approach as in the example:  \n1. **Find Initial Accounts Payable**\n2. **Find Ending Accounts Payable**\n\n### 1. Find Initial Accounts Payable\n\nLook for lines in the initial balances that represent \"Accounts Payable\".\n\nFrom the initial balances:\n\n| Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit  | ... | 3,000,000.0 | ... |\n| Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit  | ... | 5,000,000.0 | ... |\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets  | ... | 5,000,000.0 | ... |\n\nNone of these is Accounts Payable.  \n**Initial Value: 0.00**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Ending Accounts Payable\n\nEnding Accounts Payable = Initial + Purchases/expenses recorded as \"Unpaid\"/\"Account Payable\" - repayments to suppliers\n\nScan all purchases for lines with:\n\n- payment/receipt_status = Unpaid OR\n- payment_method = Account Payable\n\nThese count as additions to Accounts Payable. \n\n#### Go through all purchase lines:\n\n#### Find All Purchases with Unpaid/Account Payable\n\nLet's focus on the purchases:\n\n| id                | type     | date         | ... | amount    | ... | payment/receipt_status | payment_method      | ... | supplier | ... |\n|-------------------|----------|--------------|-----|-----------|-----|-----------------------|---------------------|-----|----------|-----|\n| Purchase20231231001 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 540,000.0 | ... | Paid                  | Bank Transfer       | ... | S003     | ... |\n| Purchase20231231002 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... |2,500,000.0| ... | Paid                  | Bank Transfer       | ... | S009     | ... |\n| Purchase20231231003 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 280,000.0 | ... | Paid                  | Bank Transfer       | ... | S006     | ... |\n| Purchase20231231004 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... |1,200,000.0| ... | Paid                  | Cash                | ... | S005     | ... |\n| Purchase20231231005 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... |2,700,000.0| ... | Unpaid                | Account Payable     | ... | S001     | ... |\n| Purchase20231231006 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 520,000.0 | ... | Paid                  | Bank Transfer       | ... | S001     | ... |\n| Purchase20231231007 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... |1,300,000.0| ... | Paid                  | Bank Transfer       | ... | S007     | ... |\n| Purchase20231231008 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 120,000.0 | ... | Paid                  | Cash                | ... | S001     | ... |\n| Purchase20231231009 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 140,000.0 | ... | Paid                  | Cash                | ... | S002     | ... |\n\nFrom these, only **Purchase20231231005** has:\n\n- payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\"\n- payment_method = \"Account Payable\"\n- amount = 2,700,000.0\n\nNo other purchases are unpaid/account payable.\n\n**Total Credits to Accounts Payable:**  \n= 2,700,000.0\n\n#### Look for Repayments/Reductions\n\nIn the problem data, do any other lines reduce (debit) Accounts Payable (i.e., payments to suppliers against old payables)?\n\n- For purchases paid in cash/bank transfer etc, those are current payments, not past payables.\n- No line is titled \"Accounts Payable - payment\" or similar. \n- No explicit repayments.\n- No expenses with payment_method = Accounts Payable or supplier_id set.\n\nTherefore, **no repayments are recorded** for Accounts Payable. All other purchases/expenses are \"Paid\" at the time of transaction.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Solution\n\n- Initial Value: **0.00**\n- End Value: **2,700,000.00**\n\n---\n\n## Final Output\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"2700000.00\"} }\n```",
