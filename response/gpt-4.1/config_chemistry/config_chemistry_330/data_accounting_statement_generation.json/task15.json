Identify Total Liabilities\n\nA balance sheet's Total Liabilities usually include short-term and long-term debts the company owes to others as of the balance sheet date:\n- Accounts Payable (Unpaid purchases, unpaid expenses using \"Account Payable\" etc.)\n- Any unpaid interests/loans (there are interest receivables here, so likely not liabilities)\n- Other accrued but unpaid debts\n\nIn the sample, \"Unpaid\" purchases with \"Account Payable\" payment methods add to liabilities. Cash/bank paid purchases do not. \"Interest Receivable\" is an asset, not a liability.\n\n### Initial Liabilities\n\nInitial entries are:\n```\n| Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | ... | 3000000.0\n| Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | ... | 5000000.0\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | ... | 5000000.0\n```\nThese are assets, not liabilities. **No initial liabilities**.\n\n### Liabilities at Ending (2024-01-29)\n\nLook for entries with:\n- \"Unpaid\" status\n- AND/OR \"Account Payable\" payment method\n- AND/OR explicitly mentioned as a liability\n\nLet's go through purchases (potential liabilities):\n\n#### Purchases\n\n| id                | type      | payment_status | payment_method  | amount     |\n|-------------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|------------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | Purchase | Paid          | Bank Transfer   | 540,000.00 | (PAID)\n| Purchase20231231002 | Purchase | Paid          | Bank Transfer   |2,500,000.00| (PAID)\n| Purchase20231231003 | Purchase | Paid          | Bank Transfer   | 280,000.00 | (PAID)\n| Purchase20231231004 | Purchase | Paid          | Cash            |1,200,000.00| (PAID)\n| Purchase20231231005 | Purchase | Unpaid        | Account Payable |2,700,000.00| (UNPAID)\n| Purchase20231231006 | Purchase | Paid          | Bank Transfer   | 520,000.00 | (PAID)\n| Purchase20231231007 | Purchase | Paid          | Bank Transfer   |1,300,000.00| (PAID)\n| Purchase20231231008 | Purchase | Paid          | Cash            | 120,000.00 | (PAID)\n| Purchase20231231009 | Purchase | Paid          | Cash            | 140,000.00 | (PAID)\n\nFrom here, only **Purchase20231231005** is unpaid/account payable:\n- **2,700,000.00**\n\n#### Expenses\n\nAdministrative/sales/financial expenses are all 'Paid', so not unpaid payables.\n\n#### Other Liabilities?\n\nCheck for any other \"Unpaid\" with \"Account Payable\":\n- Only purchases, all other \"Unpaid\" entries appear to be for \"Interest Receivables\" (which are assets, not liabilities).\n\n#### Final Total Liabilities\n\nSum only the unpaid \"Purchase\" entries:\n- 2,700,000.00\n\n#### Double check: Any other possible accrued/unpaid amounts?\n\nNo \"Notes Payable\", \"Loans\", or similar. No other purchase/expense lines are \"Unpaid\".\n\n## Final Answer (Round to two decimals):\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"2700000.00\"} }\n```",
