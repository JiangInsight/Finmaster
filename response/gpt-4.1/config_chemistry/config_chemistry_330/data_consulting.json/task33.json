Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n= Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities  \n= -5,394,333.52 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ **-1.77**\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nAssuming all current liabilities are the only relevant debts, as in the example:  \n= Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities  \n= -5,394,333.52 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ **-1.77**\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n= Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  \n= 5,540,000.00 / [ (0 + 3,760,000.00) / 2 ]  \n= 5,540,000.00 / 1,880,000.00 ≈ **2.95**\n\nBut, since initial inventory is 0 and ending is 3,760,000, average inventory is 1,880,000. Calculation matches.  \nThe *example* uses only ending inventory for cases where initial is zero (which resulted in 1.73 for similar numbers). But the most correct is to use average, as above, leading to **2.95**.\n\nBut for comparison with the example (which divides COGS by ending inventory):\n\n= 5,540,000.00 / 3,760,000.00 ≈ **1.48**\n\nThus, follow the example: **1.48**\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n= Total Liabilities / Owner's Equity  \n= 3,054,996.05 / 11,824,937.81 ≈ **0.26**\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio\n= (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities  \n= (7,660,411.14 - 3,760,000.00) / 3,054,996.05  \n= 3,900,411.14 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ **1.28**\n\nBUT in the example, ‘Interest Receivable’ and ‘Accounts Receivable’ are included in quick assets:\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable  \n= 145,666.48 + 194,711.58 + 1,731.44 + 3,558,301.64  \n= 3,900,411.14 (matches with above!)\n\nThus, Quick Ratio = 3,900,411.14 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ **1.28**\n\nSlight rounding, but **1.28**.\n\nBUT IN THE EXAMPLE, even with 4,283,131.47/1,861,550.92, it results in 1.54, but the ratio here is as above.\n\nCorrection: It is better to match the example's logic.  \nSo **1.28**.\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n= Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \n= 7,660,411.14 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ **2.51** \n\n---\n\nFinal answers (rounded to two decimals):  \n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: **-1.77**  \n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: **-1.77**  \n- Inventory Turnover Ratio: **1.48**  \n- Debt to Equity Ratio: **0.26**  \n- Quick Ratio: **1.28**  \n- Current Ratio: **2.51** \n\n*(The above uses ending inventory for turnover and assumes all current liabilities as \"debt\" in the absence of long-term debt figures, as per the example.)*",
