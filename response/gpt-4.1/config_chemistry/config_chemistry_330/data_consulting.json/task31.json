Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n= Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable  \nAssuming all revenue is on credit (no explicit breakdown),  \n- Net Credit Sales (from income statement): 7,099,920.95  \n- Average Accounts Receivable: (Begin + End) / 2 = (0 + 3,558,301.64)/2 = 1,779,150.82  \nSo,  \n= 7,099,920.95 / 1,779,150.82 ≈ **3.99**  \n\nBut in your previous pattern, you rounded instead to:  \n= 7,099,920.95 / ( (0 + 3,558,301.64) / 2 ) = 3.99 (rounded to two decimals: **3.99**, but initial example used end balance only, so:  \n7,099,920.95 / 3,558,301.64 ≈ **1.99**  \n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio  \n= Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n- Operating Cash Flow: -5,394,333.52  \n- Current Liabilities: 3,054,996.05  \n= -5,394,333.52 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ **-1.77**  \n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio  \nSame as above, as the definitions often overlap: **-1.77**\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio  \n= Total Revenue / Average Total Assets  \n- Total Revenue: 7,099,920.95  \n- Average Total Assets: (Begin + End) / 2 = (13,000,000.00 + 14,879,933.86) / 2 = 13,939,966.93  \n= 7,099,920.95 / 13,939,966.93 ≈ **0.51** (rounded to two decimals: **0.51**; your previous sample used end balance only, so 7,099,920.95 / 14,879,933.86 ≈ **0.48**, but to match your previous approach I'll use average.)\n\nBut in the previous sample, a similar calculation used only the end balance (to give 0.41 for 5431018.59/13216409.49). Let's use end balance for consistency:  \n7,099,920.95 / 14,879,933.86 ≈ **0.48**\n\nBut initial instructions used only end balance for consistency, so **0.48**\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio  \n= Total Liabilities / Owner's Equity  \n- Total Liabilities (End): 3,054,996.05  \n- Owner’s Equity (End): 11,824,937.81  \n= 3,054,996.05 / 11,824,937.81 ≈ **0.26**\n\n---\n\n**Final filled values (matching the provided format and rounding conventions):**\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: \"1.99\"  \n- operating cash flow ratio: \"-1.77\"  \n- operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio: \"-1.77\"  \n- Total Asset Turnover Ratio: \"0.48\"  \n- Debt to Equity Ratio: \"0.26\"  \n\nBut your previous solution gives 0.41 for total asset turnover using end balance. So by strict patterned imitation:\n\n7,099,920.95 / 14,879,933.86 = 0.4775→\"0.48\"  \nFinal answer is as initially structured above.",
