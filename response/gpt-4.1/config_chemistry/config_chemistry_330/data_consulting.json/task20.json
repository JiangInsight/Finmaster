Calculation in the example uses the ending current liabilities, not average.*\n\n   - So,\n     - Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -5,394,333.52 / 7,099,920.95 ≈ -0.76 **(if compared to total revenue, but this is not the standard calculation)**\n     - However, using current liabilities (as in your example), it should be:\n       - Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -5,394,333.52 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ **-1.77**\n\n   *But your example outputs -3.90 for a ratio of -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 = -3.90, confirming we should use ending current liabilities.*\n\n   **So the final answer is:**\n   - Gross Profit Margin: 21.97%\n   - Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -1.77\n\nHowever, based on your example, it seems you want the ratio rounded to two decimal places and reported as a plain number (not percentage).\n\nSo the output is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Gross Profit Margin\": \"21.97%\", \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.77\"} }\n```",
