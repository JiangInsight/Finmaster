The most reliable field in financial context is the invoice, which clearly says \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Bank deposit, totaling \\$5,000,000.00\" and separately for the other categories and amounts. This suggests that information is mixed up, possibly due to the sharing of the same transaction ID for different categories; data should be split with separate transaction IDs, or the categories and amounts corrected within the same ID according to the invoice (which is more trustworthy).\n\n- **Entry for \"Sale20240108016\"**:  \n  According to the invoice: \"On January 08, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 4.0 units at a unit price of \\$133,848.27, totaling \\$535,393.08. The cost amount for this transaction was \\$400,000.00, with a tax amount of \\$26,769.65, leading to a total amount due of \\$508,623.43. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"  \n  However, in the transaction entry:\n   - recorded_amount is 401,544.81 not 535,393.08\n   - recorded_quantity is 3, not 4\n   - recorded_payment/receipt_status is Unpaid (should be Paid)\n   - recorded_profit 109,281.87 (should be 535,393.08 - 400,000 = 135,393.08)\n\nSo these are the main internal data inconsistencies per the invoice. All other transaction fields appear aligned with their respective invoice descriptions. If you spot other mismatches based on invoice phrasing vs. row data, follow the same method.",
