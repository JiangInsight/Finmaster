Based on the invoice (generally most reliable), the original opening balances should sum up to 8,000,000.00, but the values are inconsistent.\n2. **Sale20240116028:** According to the invoice, the transaction should reflect 2 units at 13755.58 (total = 27511.16), and tax should be 1375.56, but the recorded values show only 1 unit, 14180.20 price, and tax 25575.37, which is an obvious internal error.\n3. **Sale20240130057:** The invoice says 3 units at 24766.75 (total = 74300.25, tax 3715.01), but fields record 2 units, 25021.15, and an impossible tax of 81724.53â€”clearly an inconsistency.\n\nFor all other rows, there is either no internal inconsistency, or the invoice matches the row's detail.
