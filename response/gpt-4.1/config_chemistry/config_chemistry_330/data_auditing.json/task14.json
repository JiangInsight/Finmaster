Thus:\n  - **recorded_quantity** should be 27.0 (from invoice), but is recorded as 34.0.\n  - **recorded_amount** should be 2,700,000.0 (27 Ã— 100,000), but is recorded as 3,400,000.0.\n  - **recorded_payment/receipt_status** should be Unpaid, but is recorded as Paid.\n  \n- All other transactions either match the invoice or lack explicit risk_issues, so **only this transaction row is internally inconsistent** in this batch.",
