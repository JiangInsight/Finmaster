However, their totals should be reconciled. There is missing context, but typically the opening balance (debit/credit) should equal the sum of these. Here, Bank deposit and Fixed Assets are both $5,000,000. There may be a duplication or misalignment.\n2. **Sale20240120038**: Discrepancy in **profit** calculation. Invoice total - cost amount = profit. 68,078.0 (amount) - 50,000.0 (cost) = 18,078.0, but recorded profit is 18,684.06. This is already noted in the risk_issues.\n3. **Sale20240114023**: The **profit** does not match the calculation (317,862.15 - 250,000.0 = 67,862.15), but the recorded profit is 48,671.48. This is also noted in the risk_issues.\n\n**Other entries** appear internally consistent or lack complete calculable fields for this type of inconsistency check.
