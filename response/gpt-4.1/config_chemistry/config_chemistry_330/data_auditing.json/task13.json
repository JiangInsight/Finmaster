The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $1180.23...\"\n- The row's `recorded_type` is \"Financial Expenses\", but the transaction is clearly a Sale.\n- The `recorded_tax_amount` is 25777.6, which is excessively high for a $23,604.58 sale. The invoice says tax is $1,180.23, which matches 23604.58 × 5% ≈ 1180.23.\n- All other fields match between record and invoice.\n- Therefore, the inconsistencies are:\n  - `category`/`type` should be \"Sale\", not \"Financial Expenses\".\n  - `tax` should be 1180.23, not 25777.6.\n- Other fields are either not inconsistent or not specified in the invoice.\n",
