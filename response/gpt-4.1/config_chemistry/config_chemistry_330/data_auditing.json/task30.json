The cost amount...was $30000.00, with a tax amount of $2011.21, leading to a total amount due of $38213.00. ...\"  \n    --> The type should be 'Sale', not 'Sales Expenses'.\n\n2. **Check unit price/amount:**  \n    - recorded_unit_price: 12464.89  \n    - Invoice states unit price: 13408.07  \n    --> Should be 13408.07.\n    - recorded_amount: 47113.81  \n    - Invoice states amount: 40224.21  \n    --> Should be 40224.21.\n\n3. **Tax:**  \n    - recorded_tax_amount: 40909.15  \n    - Invoice says tax: 2011.21  \n    --> Should be 2011.21.\n\n4. **Other fields:**  \n    - recorded_quantity and cost are correct per invoice.\n    - Method/receive_method ('Cash') and status ('Paid') are in-line, even though 'payment_method' is blank, but invoice says it should be 'Cash'.\n\n5. **Preparer/Approver:**  \n    - Not given in this row or quoted in the invoice.\n\n6. **ID:**  \n    - id: Sale20240127050\n\n**Thus, the above JSON captures each discrepancy and the correct value based on the invoice. All other fields that are not inconsistent or are not present in either record are left as-is.**",
