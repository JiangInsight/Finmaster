Here, the same id refers to three different events (Cash, Bank, Asset) for possibly different amounts (it's possible for asset to match bank, but bank and cash should not have the same amount if they're already split).\n- This is an internal inconsistency: either the id is not unique or the type and values are being mismatched/combined under a single id erroneously.\n- The most reliable field is the invoice description, which confirms 3 separate actions and amounts; but the id reuse is an error.\n- Therefore, the error is that the records under id \"Initial20231231001\" provide conflicting types and amounts for what should be a unique transaction and reference.\n\n**Note:** If you want each line output as a separate object, or just one summary of the id, adjust as needed. The purpose here is to show, for each instance, the mismatch of type and amount for the same id. If you want *only* the fields that are actually wrong (i.e. id, recorded_type, recorded_amount, correct_type, correct_amount, etc.) just specify!",
