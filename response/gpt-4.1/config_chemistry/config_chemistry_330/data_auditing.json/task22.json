The \"Bank deposit\" and \"Fixed Assets\" categories/amounts are incorrectly split/duplicated here for the same transaction ID.\n- The most reliable reference is the invoice: \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Cash deposit, totaling $3,000,000.00.\"\n- Therefore:\n    - All entries with this ID should be category = \"Cash deposit\", amount = 3,000,000, and duplicate categories (\"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\") and amounts (5,000,000) are in error.\n    - This is represented as two output records, as above. All other fields are not present/filled, so set to null; only differing fields are listed.\n- All other rows do not show an internal inconsistency between standardized invoice and recorded fields, except one record later in the full data with a purchase price mismatch for Purchase20231231006 on Jan 18, 2024. That example was already demonstrated in your sample answer, so not repeated here.\n\nIf you wish to be more exhaustive and check every record for quantity/price mismatches or similar, please specify!",
