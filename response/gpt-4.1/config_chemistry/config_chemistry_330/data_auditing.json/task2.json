Normally, each unique transaction id should have only one type and one amount—this looks like three different assets/transactions have been combined or duplicated erroneously under one id.\n- **Negative Interest Receivables:**  \n  - IDs like `Interest20240114014`, `Interest20240122022`, `Interest20240123023` (and also similar for some other dates) have negative `amount` for an \"Interest Receivable,\" which typically cannot be negative. The original value should likely be positive and similar to the positive values for interest in the days before and after (e.g., 12.67, 17.33, 85.65). The correct value should be positive.\n- **Date Mismatches:**  \n  - For `Expense20240107001`, an entry has a recorded date of `2024-01-31`, but the invoice says \"On January 07, 2024\", indicating the correct date should be \"2024-01-07\".\n- **Otherwise:**  \n  - All other fields, such as amount (matches invoice), status, method, etc., are consistent with their invoices or cross-checked within the row.\n\n**Note:**  \nOnly a selection is shown above to illustrate the detected inconsistencies—other consistent entries are omitted for brevity. If a longer (full) list is required, more entries could be exhaustively checked.",
