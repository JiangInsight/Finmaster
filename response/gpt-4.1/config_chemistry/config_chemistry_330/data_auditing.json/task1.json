All other fields (unpaid, interest receivable as receive method, and amount matching the invoice) match with Interest Receivables. This is the only clear internal inconsistency.\n- All other entries in this dataset are consistent, either with unique invoice/transaction IDs or their invoices match the recorded type and values (by cross-check with amount, payment method, etc).\n- There are no date, amount, payment/receipt_status, payment method, quantity, unit price, or similar inconsistencies in this sample, other than the noted category error.\n",
