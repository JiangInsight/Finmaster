Additionally, `recorded_amount` is 60114.81, which doesn't match invoice.\n- **Tax**: Invoice says tax is $2628.39 (10% of subtotal), but `recorded_tax_amount` is 48897.24 (almost as high as the subtotal—obviously wrong).\n- All other fields (category, receivable method, preparer/approver, etc.) are not contradicted by invoice, so null.\n\n**Best values:**\n- Use invoice for date, unit price, amount, tax.\n```json\n{'Original category': None, 'Recorded category': None, 'Original date': '2024-01-23', 'Recorded date': '2024-02-10', 'Original payment/receipt_status': None, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': None, 'Original payment_method': None, 'Recorded payment_method': None, 'Original quantity': None, 'Recorded quantity': '2.0', 'Original price': '26283.92', 'Recorded price': '22626.73', 'Original receive_method': None, 'Recorded receive_method': None, 'Original amount': '52567.84', 'Recorded amount': '60114.81', 'Original tax': '2628.39', 'Recorded tax': '48897.24', 'Original profit': None, 'Recorded profit': None, 'Original Preparer': None, 'Recorded Preparer': None, 'Original Approver': None, 'Recorded Approver': None, 'id': 'Sale20240123044'}\n```",
