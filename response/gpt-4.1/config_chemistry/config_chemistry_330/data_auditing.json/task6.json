It looks like this initial capital input is being divided up, but in the standard ledger and per invoice, this should be represented distinctly with unique ids for each asset/fund movement or the total should align.\n    - Since the invoice is usually reliable and mentions the amounts, but the ids overlap and the categories differ, this is an internal consistency/risk.\n\n2. **Unit price inconsistency in Sale20240128052:**\n    - In the description, it is stated: \"a Sale, consisting of 4.0 units at a unit price of $26384.98, totaling $105539.92.\"\n    - In the main entry, the recorded_unit_price is \"27564.25\", which is inconsistent with the invoice narrative and the calculated total (unit_price * quantity).\n    - Therefore, the correct unit price should be 26384.98 as per the invoice and calculation.\n\n**No other clear internal inconsistencies were detected in this sample (beyond possible negative interest entries, but as per invoice amounts, those can exist in special situations, not always record errors).** Other values such as payment status, payment method, prepared/approved were cross-consistent.\n\nIf you want more granular detection or want to filter different types of errors, please clarify!",
