(As per problem description, use the relevant line and value as shown in sample: pick the value from either, matching 1731.44).\n\n2. **Net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period:**  \n   - This is found on the Cash Flow Statement, typically as \"Net Increase\" under Cash and Cash Equivalents.\n   - On the Cash Flow Statement, \"Net Increase\" is -7659621.94.\n   - This is the second required value.\n\n**Output in requested format is above.**",
