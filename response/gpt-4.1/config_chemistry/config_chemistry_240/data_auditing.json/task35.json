The cost amount for this transaction was $500000.00, with a tax amount of $31330.76, leading to a total amount due of $595284.49. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- The tabular data has:  \n  | id               | recorded_type   | recorded_date  | recorded_amount | ... | recorded_quantity | recorded_unit_price | ... | recorded_tax_amount | recorded_after_tax_amount | recorded_cost_amount | recorded_profit |\n  |------------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|-----|-------------------|---------------------|-----|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n  | Sale20240108018  | Depreciation   | 2024-01-26    | 751938.3        | ... | 6.0              | 138635.32           | ... | 31330.76            | 595284.49                | 500000.0             | 126615.25       |\n\nInvoice fields (considered highly reliable) indicate:\n- Date: 2024-01-08, Type: Sale, Quantity: 5.0, Unit Price: 125323.05, Amount: 626615.25\n\nRecorded fields are:\n- Date: 2024-01-26, Type: Depreciation, Quantity: 6.0, Unit Price: 138635.32, Amount: 751938.3\n\nThus, the misalignments are:\n- category (\"Sale\" vs \"Depreciation\")\n- date (\"2024-01-08\" vs \"2024-01-26\")\n- quantity (\"5.0\" vs \"6.0\")\n- price (\"125323.05\" vs \"138635.32\")\n- amount (\"626615.25\" vs \"751938.3\")\n\nOther supporting fields, like payment/receipt status and method, do match (\"Paid\", \"Cash\"), so those are correct.\n\nThe rest (cost, tax, after-tax, profit, Preparer, Approver) agree or are empty (and unchanged).\n\n**Thus, all above inconsistent fields are reported, with invoice (Original) considered correct.**",
