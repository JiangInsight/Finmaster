So the answer reduces to:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Original date\": \"2024-01-04\",\n    \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-04\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n    \"Original payment_method\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": \"\",\n    \"Original quantity\": \"5.0\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"5.0\",\n    \"Original price\": \"64925.77\",\n    \"Recorded price\": \"64925.77\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": \"Cash\",\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\",\n    \"Original amount\": \"324628.85\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"324628.85\",\n    \"Original tax\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded tax\": \"\",\n    \"Original profit\": \"74628.85\",\n    \"Recorded profit\": \"55299.59\",\n    \"Original Preparer\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": \"\",\n    \"Original Approver\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded Approver\": \"\",\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240104007\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**If you want all inconsistencies in the input, just include all such detected ones in an array (as in my first block).
