Normally, there should be only one initial deposit per transaction id reflecting the correct structure. Having multiple categories and different large deposit amounts for the same ID is internally inconsistent—likely a data entry or merging error. The correct value depends on corroborating documents, but per the invoice ($3,000,000 for Cash deposit), that should be the value for the initial amount.\n\n2. **Sale20240107016**:\n   - According to the invoice (which is considered more reliable), the date should be 2024-01-07, the quantity should be 3 units, the unit price $69,617.84, amount $208,853.52. The record, however, lists 2024-01-08 for the date, only 2 units, unit price $71,654.46, and an amount of $139,235.68. These field values are internally inconsistent with the description—likely a mis-entry of both quantity and date.  \n   - The correct values should match the invoice: Date 2024-01-07, quantity 3, price $69,617.84, and amount $208,853.52. Tax and Preparer/Approver are not clearly inconsistent.\n\n(Other rows in your sample all match well between fields and invoice, or are not obviously inconsistent without external data.)\n\n**If you want an itemized risk issue output for only truly mismatched lines with details per the invoice (as in your examples above), only these two are detected in your sample.**",
