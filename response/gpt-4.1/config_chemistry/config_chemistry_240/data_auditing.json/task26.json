There are *no inconsistencies found in the new problem set* (all entries and their fields match the details given in the invoice field).\n\nAll \"invoice\" fields accurately summarize the transaction row. The amounts, categories, payment statuses, payment methods, etc., all match the standardized, regulated invoice field, and so there is no mismatch between \"recorded\" and \"original\" across the dataset provided.\n\nTherefore, all 'Original ...' and 'Recorded ...' fields are set to null. If you provide a case where the invoice summary and the row data differ (like in your example with 'Purchase' vs 'Administrative Expenses'), the solution will flag it as an inconsistency. In this dataset, no such case appears.",
