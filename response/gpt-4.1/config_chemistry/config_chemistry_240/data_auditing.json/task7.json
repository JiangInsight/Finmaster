It's not possible for three different types of deposits/assets to be under the same transaction ID. This indicates a structural or batching error but no direct field mismatch, so this is flagged as a grouping/unit-of-work problem.\n\n2. **Purchase20231231001**:\n   - The `recorded_payment/receipt_status` is \"Paid\" and `recorded_payment_method` is \"Bank Transfer\", but the invoice specifies \"account payable\" and \"unpaid\". This is an internal inconsistency as \"account payable\" implies the purchase has not been paid yet. The more reliable field (from the invoice) indicates the transaction should be Unpaid with payment method Account Payable.\n\n3. **Sale20240112028**:\n   - The invoice (structured description) states \"The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid\", but `recorded_receive_method` is \"Account Receivable\" (and possibly `recorded_payment_method` as \"Account Receivable\" as well). These do not match, and based on the invoice explanation, `receive_method` and payment method should both be \"Cash\".\n\nNo other direct mismatches were observed; most other data entries matched their invoice string counterparts or did not have enough data to identify a clear error.
