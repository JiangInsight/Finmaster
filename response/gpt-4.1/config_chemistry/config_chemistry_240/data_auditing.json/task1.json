The invoice for the row with 23339.78 claims an \"Administrative Expenses\", while 6468.64 is correctly paired with \"Financial Expenses\". Thus, 6468.64 is the correct amount and category for Financial Expenses. \n   - The row with \"Administrative Expenses\" and amount 23339.78 has likely mis-recorded the category (should be \"Financial Expenses\") and amount (should be 6468.64 for the \"Financial Expenses\" item from the invoice).\n   - All other fields otherwise match the batch style.\n   - Thus, the error is the category (should be \"Financial Expenses\") and amount (should be 6468.64) for the line with \"Administrative Expenses\", 23339.78.\n",
