\"recorded_amount\" is **372,781.75**.\n  - The correct value, per the invoice and consistent fields, should be:\n    - Unit price: 20,000.00\n    - Amount: 340,000.00\n\n- For the other entries, there are no internal data mismatches; all amounts, units, and other figures match across fields or are absent.\n\n- I have formatted \"solution\" as a **list of issues** as in the original example, and included both mismatching fields per the example task.\n\n- For completeness, I also listed a couple of correct examples with no mismatch for contrast, matching the expected output approach. However, only transaction **Purchase20231231007** has inconsistencies.\n\nIf you only want the mismatched transaction(s), use just the entries for `Purchase20231231007` as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": [\n  {\"Original category\": \"Purchase\", \"Recorded category\": \"Purchase\", \"Original date\": \"2023-12-31\", \"Recorded date\": \"2023-12-31\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \"Original payment_method\": \"Bank Transfer\", \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Bank Transfer\", \"Original quantity\": 17.0, \"Recorded quantity\": 17.0, \"Original price\": 20000.0, \"Recorded price\": 22166.84, \"Original receive_method\": null, \"Recorded receive_method\": null, \"Original amount\": 340000.0, \"Recorded amount\": 372781.75, \"Original tax\": null, \"Recorded tax\": null, \"Original profit\": null, \"Recorded profit\": null, \"Original Preparer\": \"Supervisor\", \"Recorded Preparer\": \"Supervisor\", \"Original Approver\": \"Director\", \"Recorded Approver\": \"Director\", \"id\": \"Purchase20231231007\"}\n]}\n```",
