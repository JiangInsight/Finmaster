types and amounts for the same ID and date. According to the \"invoice\" field (considered more reliable), there was a Bank Deposit for 5,000,000 and a Cash Deposit for 3,000,000, but the type \"Fixed Assets\" for 5,000,000 appears to be a duplicate of \"Bank deposit\" and should be checked for error. Thus, one row should be Bank deposit (5,000,000), one Cash deposit (3,000,000), and not all as type \"Initial20231231001\". The \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Bank deposit\" for 5,000,000 conflict for the same ID (both can't be correct).\n\n2. **Expense20240101001** appears four times for the same ID, date, and payment information but with different types and amounts. Only two (one Sales Expenses and one Administrative Expenses), or the amounts, may be swapped. Comparing to the invoice, the amounts and types may have been swapped or duplicated by row order errors.\n\n3. **Sale20240112027** appears as a sale for 0 units and $0.0 in amount, but the invoice and the other fields indicate there should be 1 unit, $11,505.06 amount, tax $575.25, cost $10,000, and correct profit $1505.06. The status in the recorded row is \"Unpaid,\" but invoice says \"paid\". The correct record should be for 1 unit, $11,505.06, paid by cash.\n\nIf you need all duplications or similar inconsistencies detailed for every possible example, let me know.",
