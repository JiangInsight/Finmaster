Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0; Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0; Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.0, which if all three are part of the initial setup should sum to a logical total.  \n- Typically, in such opening balances, the sum of assets (cash + bank + fixed assets) should match the actual initial investment (capital/equity), but the invoice description appears to attribute the full amount for each, possibly double-counting bank/fixed assets, or the breakdown is unclear. Notably, both `Bank deposit` and `Fixed Assets` have the same amount of 5,000,000.0, which is suspicious.\n- There may be a mis-coding in categories or overstatement of one or more lines. The most likely correct structure, based on normal accounting, would have the total initial capital broken down into the individual components, not with overlap or ambiguous doubling.\n- This violates internal consistency, and the breakdown in the table does not match the standard canonical Opening Balance entry.  \n- Therefore, the Original category should be 'Initial (Opening Balance)', and the total should not double-count; possibly, one of the 5,000,000 entries is an error.\n\n**Note:**  \n- Other entries in this table (e.g., Purchases, Expense, Sale, Interest Receivables) match their calculated amounts and invoice text, and do not show an internal inconsistency significant enough for this task.\n- If you want rows for e.g., Sale20240125052 (where the \"recorded\" quantity, price, amount, tax do not match what the invoice says), please clarify whether you want \"all\" such errors or just the Initial Opening case as above. If so, I can extend the answer for other mismatches.\n```",
