The row with id `Purchase20231231010` is recorded as:\n   - recorded_type: **Administrative Expenses**\n   - recorded_amount: **1,331,256.33**\n   - recorded_quantity: **25.0**\n   - recorded_unit_price: **47,176.59**\n\n2. The invoice (text description) on the same row says:\n   - \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Purchase, consisting of 25.0 units at a unit price of $50,000.00, totaling $1,250,000.00. The payment_method of this transaction was account payable, and this transaction was unpaid. This transaction was prepared by Supervisor, and the approver is Director. The supplier ID is S002, and the supplier name is Supplier 2.\"\n\n3. Observed discrepancies:\n   - **Type/category:** should be \"Purchase\", recorded as \"Administrative Expenses\".\n   - **Unit price:** should be 50,000.0, recorded as 47,176.59.\n   - **Amount:** should be 1,250,000.0 (25*50,000), recorded as 1,331,256.33.\n\n4. The invoice field is considered most reliable (per prompt).\n   - So, we use \"Purchase\" as original category, 50,000.0 as unit price, 1,250,000.0 as amount.\n\n5. Other fields match invoice (quantity 25.0, supplier).\n\n6. Other fields (date, payment method, etc.) are inferred as correct/no error, since not stated otherwise.\n\n**Summary:**  \nWe have three inconsistencies: recorded category, recorded unit price, and recorded amount.",
