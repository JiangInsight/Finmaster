The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\") clearly states the category should be \"Interest Receivables\" and the receive method should be \"Interest receviable\".\n- However, the row records the type as \"Sales Expenses\" and the receive method as \"Account Receivable\".\n- All other fields (date, amount, unpaid status) match and there is no contradiction.\n- The most reliable value is in the invoice. Thus, corrections are as above.",
