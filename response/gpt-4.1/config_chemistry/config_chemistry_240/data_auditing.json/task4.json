Duplicate/Conflicting Initial Entries\n- **Lines:** Three records with id = Initial20231231001 with types \"Cash deposit\" for 3,000,000, \"Bank deposit\" 5,000,000, and \"Fixed Assets\" 5,000,000, all on same date.\n- **Invoice Statement:** Each invoice says a single transaction for that code and date, but the amounts/types differ.\n- **Analysis:** Only one of these should exist for that id per invoice. The invoice amount for \"Bank deposit\" and \"Fixed Assets\" matches (5,000,000) while \"Cash deposit\" is 3,000,000. There cannot be three separate transactions for the same id; most likely double-counting or incorrect splitting.\n- **Best Estimate:** Based on invoices, the correct amount/type for id Initial20231231001 is \"Bank deposit\" or \"Fixed Assets\" for 5,000,000 on 2023-12-31; \"Cash deposit\" entry is likely spurious or double counted.\n\n\n### 2. Payment Method Error\n- **Line:** Expense20240106001, type \"Financial Expenses\" amount 26390.16, payment_method \"Bank Transfer\"\n- **Invoice Statement:** \"The payment_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- **Analysis:** The invoice is explicit that payment_method must be \"Cash\". All surrounding entries for expenses for this id also use \"Cash\".\n- **Best Estimate:** Based on invoice, payment_method should be \"Cash\", not \"Bank Transfer\".\n\n---\n\n**Note:** All other fields are consistent between the rows and the invoice and there are repeated multi-line expense records with different amounts (explained as distinct expense categories, matching invoice details).\n\n**If you want further inconsistencies for all rows, please specify.**",
