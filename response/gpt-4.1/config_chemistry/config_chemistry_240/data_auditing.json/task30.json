The cost amount for this transaction was $60000.00, with a tax amount of $3333.64, leading to a total amount due of $63339.20. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n- However, several recorded fields are inconsistent:\n    - **Category:** Recorded as 'Financial Expenses', should be 'Sale'.\n    - **Unit price:** Recorded as 23775.81, but invoice says 22224.28.\n    - **Amount:** Recorded as 70628.86, but invoice says 66672.84.\n    - **Tax:** Recorded as 75665.26, but the invoice specifies 3333.64.\n    - The quantity and receive_method are consistent.\n    - The profit field is inconsistent; should be amount - cost = 66672.84-60000=6672.84 if calculated, but this is not explicit on the invoice.\n- All other fields rely on invoice or are not given/inconsistent, thus set to null or as above.\n- No evidence for change of payment/receipt status, payment method, date, Preparer/Approver.\n\n**In summary:** This transaction is incorrectly recorded in several fields, most clearly shown by the difference between the invoice and the row data.",
