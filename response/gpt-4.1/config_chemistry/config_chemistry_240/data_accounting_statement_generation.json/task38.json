All these sales remain open.\n\n#### **So, all of the sum is the closing AR.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Change (increase)\n\n- Opening AR = 0.0  \n- Closing AR = 2,498,141.24\n\n- Change = Opening - Closing = 0.0 - 2,498,141.24 = **-2,498,141.24**\n\n**Increases in AR are negative in the cash flow statement (as per standard reporting).**\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Format in JSON\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-2498141.24\"} }\n```\n\n**NOTE:**  \n- If there are any settlements or collections on account, those would reduce AR; but typically, only \"Paid\" sales represent cash sales, and \"Unpaid\"/\"Account Receviable\" sales remain in AR.\n- If you want to check against \"received AR\", you'd find entries where payment/status converts from \"Unpaid\" to \"Paid\", but the table does not show any AR collections separately for Jan 2024.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-2498141.24\"} }\n```",
