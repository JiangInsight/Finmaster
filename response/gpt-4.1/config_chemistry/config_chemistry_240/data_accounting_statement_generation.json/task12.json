Definition\n\n**Accounts Payable (AP)**: Liability to suppliers for purchases made on credit (unpaid).  \n- **Initial Amount**: Starting balance from initial data (if any).  \n- **Final Amount**: Initial + all purchases \"Unpaid\" (Account Payable) - all repayments (not present here, since only purchases are shown).\n\n### 2. Locate Initial Accounts Payable\n\nLook in the initial entries for AP:\n- Only these:\n    | Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | ...\n    | Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | ...\n    | Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | ...\n- **No initial AP = 0**\n\n### 3. Find \"Purchase\" transactions with unpaid/account payable\n\nFilter rows:\n- type = \"Purchase\"\n- payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\"\n- payment_method = \"Account Payable\"\n\nLocate and sum such rows.\n\n#### **Extracting All \"Unpaid\" Purchases:**\n\nFrom above, the following fit the criteria:\n\n| id              | type     | amount     | payment/receipt_status   | payment_method   |\n|-----------------|----------|------------|-------------------------|------------------|\n| Purchase20231231002 | Purchase | 800,000.0 | Unpaid                  | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231004 | Purchase | 750,000.0 | Unpaid                  | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231010 | Purchase | 1,250,000.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231012 | Purchase | 210,000.0 | Unpaid                  | Account Payable  |\n\n**Add amounts:**\n\n- 800,000.0\n- 750,000.0\n- 1,250,000.0\n- 210,000.0\n\nSum:\n- 800,000 + 750,000 = 1,550,000\n- 1,550,000 + 1,250,000 = 2,800,000\n- 2,800,000 + 210,000 = **3,010,000**\n\n### 4. Check for Repayments\n\nAre there any transactions reducing AP, i.e. payments to suppliers matching these AP entries?\nLooking at the data, all other purchases are listed as \"Paid\" with some method.\nNo entries showing payments to AP (e.g., \"Payment to Supplier\", \"Settlement of Account Payable\").\n\n**So, AP only increases with these unpaid purchases, and is not shown as decreased.**\n\n### 5. Put all together\n\n- **Initial AP = 0.00**\n- **End AP = 3,010,000.00**\n\n---\n\n## Final output\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"3010000.00\"} }\n```",
