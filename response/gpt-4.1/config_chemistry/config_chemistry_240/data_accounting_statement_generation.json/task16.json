It is NOT affected by sales, purchases, expenses, depreciation, bank/cash transfers, income or profitâ€”only shareholder investments or withdrawals change it.\n\n2. **Find Initial Paid-in Capital**:  \n   Look for the initial \"capital injection\" transactions, usually at the start date and under \"Initial\" entries:\n   - 2023-12-31: Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n   - 2023-12-31: Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n   - 2023-12-31: Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.0  \n   These three are grouped under the same initial transaction id (Initial20231231001).  \n   Sum: 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = **13,000,000.0**\n\n3. **Check for Further Capital Changes**:  \n   - There are NO further transactions of \"Owner investment,\" \"additional paid-in capital,\" or \"capital withdrawal.\"\n   - All other entries are regular business transactions: sales, purchases, expenses, depreciation, transfers, etc., which do not affect Paid-in Capital.\n\n4. **Final Paid-in Capital**:  \n   Since there are no capital withdrawals/contributions after the initial, the End Value = Initial Value = **13,000,000.0**.\n\n5. **Formatting**: As in the sample and per instruction, present answers with two decimal places.\n\n**Result**:  \nPaid-in Capital Initial Value: \"13000000.00\"  \nPaid-in Capital End Value: \"13000000.00\"\n```",
