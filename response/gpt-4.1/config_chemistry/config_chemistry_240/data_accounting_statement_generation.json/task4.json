                        "content": "To solve for Accounts Receivable (A/R), we follow these principles:\n\n- **Initial Value** comes from the opening balance at the date before the first transaction period (here, 2023-12-31). We look for any line indicating an initial value for A/R. If there is none, it means it starts at 0.\n- **Ending Value** is the accumulated effect of all A/R-increasing transactions minus all A/R-collecting (i.e., customer payments) during the period.\n\n## Step 1: Find Accounts Receivable Initial Value\n\n- At 2023-12-31, there are only:\n  - Cash deposit\n  - Bank deposit\n  - Fixed Assets\n\nNo initial A/R balance.  \n**Accounts Receivable Initial Value = 0.00**\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Add All Sales Generating A/R\n\nWe look for all **Sale** transactions from 2024-01-01 onwards where:\n- `payment/receipt_status` is **Unpaid** or\n- `receive_method` is **Account Receivable** or similar wording.\n\n### Extract all Sales to A/R:\n\nFrom the table, relevant columns for AR are:\n- `type` = Sale\n- [AND] (`payment/receipt_status` contains \"Unpaid\" OR `receive_method` = Account Receivable)\n- The field `amount` is the value added to AR.\n\nExtracting all such transactions:\n\n| date         | id           | amount      | Notes\n|--------------|--------------|-------------|------\n2024-01-02 | Sale20240102003 | 224,961.24 | A/R sale\n2024-01-03 | Sale20240103005 | 57,957.22  | A/R sale\n2024-01-03 | Sale20240103006 | 123,043.3  | A/R sale\n2024-01-04 | Sale20240104008 | 35,730.78  | A/R sale\n2024-01-08 | Sale20240108017 | 44,600.64  | A/R sale\n2024-01-09 | Sale20240109020 | 75,581.34  | A/R sale\n2024-01-11 | Sale20240111025 | 661,322.55 | A/R sale\n2024-01-14 | Sale20240114031 | 174,561.21 | A/R sale\n2024-01-15 | Sale20240115032 | 278,375.6  | A/R sale\n2024-01-16 | Sale20240116035 | 113,297.76 | A/R sale\n2024-01-17 | Sale20240117036 | 63,542.4   | A/R sale\n2024-01-18 | Sale20240118039 | 124,386.6  | A/R sale\n2024-01-20 | Sale20240120044 | 272,732.32 | A/R sale\n2024-01-21 | Sale20240121045 | 111,510.49 | A/R sale\n2024-01-21 | Sale20240121046 | 66,672.84  | A/R sale\n2024-01-25 | Sale20240125051 | 69,864.95  | A/R sale\n\n#### Let's sum these up first\n\n224,961.24  \n+ 57,957.22  \n+123,043.30  \n+ 35,730.78  \n+ 44,600.64  \n+ 75,581.34  \n+661,322.55  \n+174,561.21  \n+278,375.60  \n+113,297.76  \n+ 63,542.40  \n+124,386.60  \n+272,732.32  \n+111,510.49  \n+ 66,672.84  \n+ 69,864.95  \n= **2,498,141.24**\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Subtract Receipts (A/R Collections)\n\nNow, any **collection of accounts receivable** is usually registered as a Sale whose payment method is \"Cash\" or \"Bank\", but *the original sales that were unpaid previously* will be reduced from A/R when collected.\n\nHowever, in the source data, it looks like only the original sales which are paid are marked separately as \"Paid\" and have payment method = cash/bank/whatever.\n\n*But only the sales that started as \"Unpaid\" and then get collected (partially or fully), will reduce AR.*\n\nFrom this data, we don't see records indicating that any of the above A/R sales have been collected within this period (all other \"Paid\" sales are separate sale records, not receipts against previous AR).\n\n**Therefore, all the above A/R sales remain outstanding by period-end.**\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Confirm for Other Movement\n\nCheck for negative A/R entries, write-offs, or explicit receipts/collections:\n- There are none.\n- No line items, like \"Receipt from customer\" or \"A/R write-off\", or negative sales.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Calculate Accounts Receivable End Value\n\n**Accounts Receivable End Value = Initial Value + All New A/R sales - Receipts**\n= 0.00 + 2,498,141.24 - 0.00  \n= **2,498,141.24**\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Output as JSON\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"2498141.24\"} }\n```\n",
