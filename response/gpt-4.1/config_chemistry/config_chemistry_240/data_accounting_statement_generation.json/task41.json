                        "content": "Let's follow the steps to determine \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" for the Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### 1. **What is Accounts Payable?**\nAccounts Payable is money owed to suppliers for purchases that have been recorded but not yet paid (i.e., the \"Unpaid\" purchases or those with payment_method as \"Account Payable\").\n\n### 2. **How to Calculate?**\n- **End-of-Period AP**: Sum of all unpaid purchases as of the end of the period (here, January 28, 2024).\n- **Beginning-of-Period AP**: Sum of all unpaid purchases at the beginning of the period (since the earliest entries are as of Dec 31, 2023, we consider unpaid purchases from that date as beginning AP).\n\n**Increase(Decrease) = End-of-Period AP - Beginning-of-Period AP**\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Extract Purchases with Unpaid Status**\n\n### **A. Beginning-of-Period (Opening - Dec 31, 2023)**\nLook for all purchase entries on **2023-12-31** with \"Unpaid\" & \"Account Payable\":\n\n| id                | type     | date       | amount    | payment/receipt_status | payment_method | supplier_id  | product_id | ... |\n|-------------------|----------|------------|-----------|-----------------------|----------------|--------------|------------|-----|\n| Purchase20231231002 | Purchase |2023-12-31 | 800,000.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable| S010         | P003       | ... |\n| Purchase20231231004 | Purchase |2023-12-31 | 750,000.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable| S008         | P003       | ... |\n| Purchase20231231010 | Purchase |2023-12-31 |1,250,000.0| Unpaid                | Account Payable| S002         | P003       | ... |\n| Purchase20231231012 | Purchase |2023-12-31 | 210,000.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable| S006         | P001       | ... |\n\n**Total Beginning AP:**  \n= 800,000.0 + 750,000.0 + 1,250,000.0 + 210,000.0  \n= **3,010,000.0**\n\n---\n\n### **B. End-of-Period (Closing - Jan 28, 2024)**\nLook for all \"Unpaid\" purchases up to and including Jan 28, 2024.  \nAll the above (Beginning AP) are still unpaid unless we see any evidence of payment, but let's check if there are any new unpaid purchases after Dec 31, 2023:\n\n- In the provided data, **ALL purchases after Dec 31, 2023 are either not present, or, if present, are not marked \"Unpaid\"**.\n- The only \"Unpaid\" purchases are as of Dec 31, 2023 (the same as opening).\n\n**So, End-of-Period AP = 3,010,000.0**\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Solution**\n\\[\n\\text{Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable} = \\text{Ending AP} - \\text{Beginning AP} = 3,010,000.0 - 3,010,000.0 = 0.0\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"0.00\"} }\n```\n**There is no net change in Accounts Payable over the periodâ€”the accounts payable balance remains the same.**",
