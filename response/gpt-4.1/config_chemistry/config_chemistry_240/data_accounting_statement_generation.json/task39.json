This means:\n\n\\[\n\\text{(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable} = \\text{Interest Receivable at Beginning} - \\text{Interest Receivable at End}\n\\]\n\n- If interest receivable increases, it is a reduction in cash flows (\"increase\" in receivable is subtracted)\n- If interest receivable decreases, it is an addition to cash flows (\"decrease\" in receivable is added)\n\nWe're asked to compute this adjustment based on the provided transactions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Opening and Closing Balances**  \n- The starting balance is **zero** (nothing before 2024-01-01, and initial entries only relate to cash, bank, fixed assets).\n- We need to sum up all *Interest Receivable* entries, which are marked with type \"Interest Receivables\" and \"asset_name\" = \"Interest receviable\".\n\nWe'll assume *no contra/receipts/write-offs* unless shown in the list. Only interest accruals and reversals appear in the table.\n\n**Step 3: List all Interest Receivable Movements**\n\nFind all lines where \"type\" = \"Interest Receivables\", take \"amount\", and sum them up **chronologically** to get the *ending balance*, starting from zero.\n\nList them:\n\n| Date         | Amount           |\n|--------------|------------------|\n|2024-01-01    | 428.09           |\n|2024-01-02    | 428.09           |\n|2024-01-03    | 388.03999999999996|\n|2024-01-04    | 388.03999999999996|\n|2024-01-05    | 348.88           |\n|2024-01-06    | 348.88           |\n|2024-01-07    | 348.88           |\n|2024-01-08    | 348.88           |\n|2024-01-09    | 348.88           |\n|2024-01-10    | 348.88           |\n|2024-01-11    | 108.58           |\n|2024-01-12    | 108.58           |\n|2024-01-13    | 62.57269599999999|\n|2024-01-14    | 62.57269599999999|\n|2024-01-15    | 62.57269599999999|\n|2024-01-16    | 62.57269599999999|\n|2024-01-17    | 62.57269599999999|\n|2024-01-18    | 62.57269599999999|\n|2024-01-19    | 62.57269599999999|\n|2024-01-20    | 62.57269599999999|\n|2024-01-21    | 62.57269599999999|\n|2024-01-22    | 18.86322693      |\n|2024-01-23    | -7.83677307      |\n|2024-01-24    | -16.736773069999998|\n|2024-01-25    | 9.96322693       |\n|2024-01-26    | 2.384873369999996|\n|2024-01-27    | 11.284873369999996|\n|2024-01-28    | 11.284873369999996|\n\n**Step 4: Sum the Amounts (Ending Balance)**\n\nLet's add them step by step for accuracy:\n\n1. 428.09\n2. +428.09 = 856.18\n3. +388.04 = 1244.22\n4. +388.04 = 1632.26\n5. +348.88 = 1981.14\n6. +348.88 = 2330.02\n7. +348.88 = 2678.90\n8. +348.88 = 3027.78\n9. +348.88 = 3376.66\n10. +348.88 = 3725.54\n11. +108.58 = 3834.12\n12. +108.58 = 3942.70\n13. +62.57269599999999 = 4005.272696\n14. +62.57269599999999 = 4067.845392\n15. +62.57269599999999 = 4130.418088\n16. +62.57269599999999 = 4192.990784\n17. +62.57269599999999 = 4255.56348\n18. +62.57269599999999 = 4318.136176\n19. +62.57269599999999 = 4380.708872\n20. +62.57269599999999 = 4443.281568\n21. +62.57269599999999 = 4505.854264\n22. +18.86322693 = 4524.71749093\n23. +(-7.83677307) = 4516.88071786\n24. +(-16.736773069999998) = 4500.143944790001\n25. +9.96322693 = 4510.107171720001\n26. +2.384873369999996 = 4512.492045090001\n27. +11.284873369999996 = 4523.776918460001\n28. +11.284873369999996 = 4535.061791830001\n\n**Thus, the ending balance in Interest Receivable is 4,535.06 (rounded to 2 decimals: 4535.06.)**\n\n**Step 5: Beginning Balance**\n\nAs there is no opening \"Interest Receivable\" in the initial balances (the initial records only cover cash, bank, fixed assets), the beginning balance is **zero**.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable**\n\n\\[\n\\text{(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable} = 0 - 4535.06 = -4535.06\n\\]\n\nA negative number means \"Increase in Interest Receivable\" (the company accrued this much more interest that has not been paid in cash and thus must be subtracted from profit to calculate operating cash flow).\n\n**Step 7: Present the Solution**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-4535.06\"} }\n```",
