                        "content": "Let's solve this step by step.\n\n### 1. Find Initial Value of Bank Deposits\n\nLook for the initial value at the top:\n\n| Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0 | ... |\n\n**Bank Deposits Initial Value = 5,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Identify All Transactions Affecting Bank Deposit\n\n**Bank deposit changes if:**\n- Money in/out via Bank Transfer Method (`Paid | Bank Transfer` for Purchases/Fixed Assets)\n- \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" paid by Bank Transfer\n- Ignore \"Unpaid\" (does not affect cash flow yet)\n- \"Cash to bank transfer\" does NOT change total cash+bank, just reallocation among accounts (so skip: only moves between cash to bank deposit)\n- No sales are received via bank, only cash noted (so skip those)\n- Other: Only transactions with payment_method \"Bank Transfer\" or \"Paid\" and spending.\n\n---\n\n#### Go through the transactions, sum up:\n\n#### **Purchases Paid via Bank Transfer:**\n\n- Purchase20231231001 | amount: 190,000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n- Purchase20231231003 | 450,000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n- Purchase20231231006 | 100,000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n- Purchase20231231007 | 340,000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n- Purchase20231231009 | 2,700,000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n- Purchase20231231013 | 800,000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n- Purchase20231231014 | 400,000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n\n#### **Fixed Assets Paid via Bank Transfer:**\n\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | 516,936.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | 491,117.63 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | 585,150.04 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n\n---\n\nLet's sum these:\n\n**Purchases via Bank Transfer:**\n- 190,000.0\n- 450,000.0\n- 100,000.0\n- 340,000.0\n- 2,700,000.0\n- 800,000.0\n- 400,000.0\n\n**Sum:**  \n= 190,000  \n+ 450,000 → 640,000  \n+ 100,000 → 740,000  \n+ 340,000 → 1,080,000  \n+ 2,700,000 → 3,780,000  \n+ 800,000 → 4,580,000  \n+ 400,000 → 4,980,000\n\n**Purchases via Bank Transfer = 4,980,000.0**\n\n---\n\n**Fixed Assets Purchases via Bank Transfer:**\n- 516,936.0\n- 491,117.63\n- 585,150.04\n\n**Sum:**  \n= 516,936.00  \n+ 491,117.63 → 1,008,053.63  \n+ 585,150.04 → 1,593,203.67\n\n**Fixed Assets Total via Bank Transfer: 1,593,203.67**\n\n---\n\n**Grand Total Outflow via Bank Transfer:**\n4,980,000.0 + 1,593,203.67 = **6,573,203.67**\n\n---\n\n#### **Any Inflows to Bank Deposit?**\n\nIn this data, there are **no purchases (returns, refunds)** and **no sales or other income** listed as Paid via \"Bank Transfer\" or similar, nor any external fundings. So, **no inflows**.\n\nThe only initial balance is the initial 5,000,000.00.  \n\"Cash to bank transfer\" is just moving cash into bank--doesn't increase total cash + bank.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Calculate Final Value\n\nBank Deposits End Value = Initial Value - Outflows + Inflows  \n= **5,000,000.00** - **6,573,203.67** + 0  \n= **-1,573,203.67** (negative would mean more spent than started)\n\nBut... a negative \"bank deposit\" is not realistic--it would mean the account is overdrawn (bank loan), if not otherwise explained. That is, unless some inflows are missing.\n\n#### Double Check for Any Missed Inflows\n- Sales: All are labeled as \"Cash\" method.  \n- Fixed Assets Purchase: all \"Paid | Bank Transfer\" already counted.  \n- There are also \"Paid | Cash\" everywhere else.\n\n#### There is one \"Paid\" on a Sale with method not specified:\n- E.g. in Sale20240104007: \"Paid\", but payment_method is blank and cost_per_unit value is filled -- but product fields indicate \"Cash\" (see receive_method field = \"Cash\" or empty).\n\nSo, we must assume only explicit \"Bank Transfer\" transactions out on bank.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Present the Answer as Required\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"-1573203.67\"} }\n```\n*Note: Negative implies overdrawn, unless the business took a loan or additional funding not listed.*\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Transaction Type         | Amount         |\n|-------------------------|---------------|\n| Initial Bank Deposit    | 5,000,000.00  |\n| Purchases (Bank Transf) | 4,980,000.00  |\n| Fix Assets (Bank Transf)| 1,593,203.67  |\n| **Total Outflow**       | 6,573,203.67  |\n| **Net End Value**       | -1,573,203.67 |\n\n---\n\n## **Final Formatted JSON**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"-1573203.67\"} }\n```",
