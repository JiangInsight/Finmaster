Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nFormula:\n> Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity\n\nFrom balance sheet (ending):\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3,428,090.41  (only current; no long-term debt is shown)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 11,657,959.24\n\nDebt to Equity = 3,428,090.41 / 11,657,959.24 ≈ 0.294\n\nRounded to two decimals: **0.29**\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\nFormula:\n> Net Profit Margin = Net Profit / Total Revenue × 100%\n\n- Net Profit = -1,342,040.76\n- Total Revenue = 8,361,807.77\n\nNet Profit Margin = (-1,342,040.76 / 8,361,807.77) × 100% ≈ -16.05%\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n\nFormula:\n> ROA = Net Profit / Total Assets × 100%\n\n- Net Profit = -1,342,040.76\n- Total Assets = 15,086,049.65\n\nROA = (-1,342,040.76 / 15,086,049.65) × 100% ≈ -8.90%\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\nFormula:\n> Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n- Net Credit Sales = Total Revenue = 8,361,807.77  (if we assume all sales are on credit)\n- Accounts Receivable at beginning: 0.00\n- Accounts Receivable at end: 2,498,141.24\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable = (0 + 2,498,141.24) / 2 = 1,249,070.62\n\nART Ratio = 8,361,807.77 / 1,249,070.62 ≈ 6.693\n\nHowever, as per example (when receivables are zero at start and all sales are assumed on credit), typically only ending balance is used in denominator (but safest to use average). \n\nIf following average method (which is more correct):\n- ART Ratio ≈ 6.69\n\nIf following example and divide only by ending balance:\n- ART Ratio = 8,361,807.77 / 2,498,141.24 ≈ 3.35\n\n**Since the example uses ending balance, we follow that.**\n\n---\n\n**Final Answers:**\n\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: **0.29**\n- Net Profit Margin: **-16.05%**\n- Return on Assets (ROA): **-8.90%**\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: **3.35**",
