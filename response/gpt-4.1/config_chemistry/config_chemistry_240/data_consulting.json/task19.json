Current Ratio**\nFormula:  \nCurrent Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet (as of 2024-01-28):\n- Total Current Assets = 8,538,597.02\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,428,090.41\n\nSo,\nCurrent Ratio = 8,538,597.02 / 3,428,090.41 ≈ 2.49\n\n---\n\n**2. Inventory Turnover Ratio**\nFormula:  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nFrom income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 6,720,000.00\n\nFrom balance sheet:\n- Beginning Inventory (2023-12-31): 0.00\n- Ending Inventory (2024-01-28): 4,530,000.00\n\nAverage Inventory = (0.00 + 4,530,000.00) / 2 = 2,265,000.00\n\nSo,\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 6,720,000.00 / 2,265,000.00 ≈ 2.97\n\n**BUT in the example, when beginning inventory is zero, they did:**\nInventory Turnover Ratio = COGS / Ending Inventory  \n= 6,720,000.00 / 4,530,000.00 ≈ 1.48\n\n**However, that is not in line with standard conventions**  \nThe more accepted way is to use average inventory, unless stated otherwise.\n\nBut in the example, they used ending inventory as average inventory when beginning was zero.  \nFrom the example:\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 4,410,000.00 / 5,090,000.00 = 0.866... ~1.73\n\nSo for consistency with the example:\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 6,720,000.00 / 4,530,000.00 ≈ 1.48\n\nBut the example gives 1.73 for 4,410,000/5,090,000 (which is actually around 0.866), meaning their calculation may be using average inventory (even if beginning is 0).\n\nLet’s check with average inventory:\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 6,720,000.00 / 2,265,000.00 ≈ 2.97\n\nBut in example, COGS / Ending Inventory = 4,410,000 / 5,090,000 = 0.866, but they write 1.73, which is 4,410,000 / (5,090,000/2) = 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 = 1.73\n\nSo  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = 6,720,000.00 / 2,265,000.00 ≈ 2.97\n\n**Therefore, for consistency with the example:**\nInventory Turnover Ratio = COGS / (Ending Inventory / 2)\n\n= 6,720,000.00 / (4,530,000.00 / 2)  \n= 6,720,000.00 / 2,265,000.00  \n≈ 2.97\n\nBut in example, the number is simply the result of dividing COGS by half the ending inventory.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nCurrent Ratio: 2.49  \nInventory Turnover Ratio: 2.97",
