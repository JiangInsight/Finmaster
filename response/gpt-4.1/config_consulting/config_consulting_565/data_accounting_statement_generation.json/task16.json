                        "content": "Let's analyze the data step by step:\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: What is Paid-in Capital?**\n\nPaid-in Capital refers to the capital contributed by the shareholders or owners to the company. Usually, this is only recorded when cash, bank, or non-cash assets are contributed directly by the owners as capital, often at the company's establishment or through subsequent additional capital infusions.  \nIt is NOT affected by normal operating transactions like purchases, sales, expenses, or even depreciation, unless there is a specific capital injection or withdrawal.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Find relevant entries**\n\nLook for \"Initial\" or other transactions indicating capital contribution by shareholders/owners.\n\n**From the data:**\n\n| id               | type         | date       | amount    |\n|------------------|--------------|------------|-----------|\n| Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | 3,000,000 |\n| Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 5,000,000 |\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 5,000,000 |\n\n- These are all under the same \"Initial20231231001\" id, on 2023-12-31, and all are capital investments (cash, bank and fixed assets deposited into the company at startup).\n\n**Sum:**\n- Cash:        3,000,000\n- Bank:        5,000,000\n- Fixed Assets:5,000,000\n- **Total:** 13,000,000\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Check for later capital changes**\n\nSkim subsequent transactions for any additional explicit capital injection or owner withdrawal.\n\n- All subsequent entries are purchases, sales, expenses, depreciations, or interest receivables â€“ none indicate further capital injection or withdrawal.\n- There are **no transactions** like \"Capital Increase\", \"Withdrawals\", \"Dividend Distribution\", or similar.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion for Initial & Final Paid-in Capital**\n\n- **Initial Paid-in Capital:** 13,000,000\n- **Final Paid-in Capital:**   13,000,000\n    - Since no events updated the Paid-in Capital, the balance remains the same.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer (in required format):**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"13000000.00\"} }\n```",
