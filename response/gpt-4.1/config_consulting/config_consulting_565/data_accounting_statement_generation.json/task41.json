                        "content": "Let's walk step by step:\n\n## 1. What is the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\"?\n\n- In a cash flow statement (indirect method), \"Increase in Accounts Payable\" is the net change (ending - beginning balance) in AP, or, specifically, the amount of purchases booked on credit (i.e., not yet paid out), **less** the amount paid off during the period.\n- In practice: **Add up all new unpaid purchases (which increase AP), subtract unpaid AP at beginning (if relevant), but since this is a current period, it's usually just sum up unpaid \"purchases\" (not yet paid).**\n- Only *purchases* (not expenses or interest or depreciation; and not sales), and only those marked as **Unpaid** or with payment method = \"Account Payable\".\n\n## 2. Find all Purchase transactions and Accounts Payable\n\nGo through all lines, focus on:\n- **type = Purchase**\n- **payment/receipt_status = Unpaid** or **payment_method = Account Payable**\n\nExtract amount for each such purchase.\n\n### Pick out relevant transactions\n\n#### Find unpaid (on credit, i.e. Accounts Payable) purchases:\n\n| id                | type      | amount    | payment/receipt_status | payment_method    |\n|-------------------|-----------|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | Purchase  | 2000.0    | Unpaid                 | Account Payable   |\n| Purchase20231231007 | Purchase  | 60000.0   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable   |\n| Purchase20231231016 | Purchase  | 200000.0  | Unpaid                 | Account Payable   |\n| Purchase20231231020 | Purchase  | 40000.0   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable   |\n\nAre there any other purchases with payment method = Account Payable or Unpaid?\nAll other purchases are either Paid or paid with Bank Transfer/Cash (i.e. not AP).\n\n#### Check for other possible APs:\n- Sometimes purchases have \"Unpaid\" + no method set, but in accounting, only \"Unpaid\" purchases with clear credit or account payable terms count.\n- All other \"Unpaid\" (such as Sale or Interest Receivables) are not payables but **receivables** or not purchases.\n\n#### Should we subtract anything?\n- There is **no previous period opening AP** given. All initial transactions are for deposits or fixed assets.\n- Unless instructed otherwise, we do **not** subtract \"previous\" AP as there is no opening AP.\n\n## 3. Calculate Total Increase in AP\n\nSum all relevant Unpaid Purchases:\n\n- 2000.0\n- 60000.0\n- 200000.0\n- 40000.0\n\nSum = 2000.0 + 60000.0 + 200000.0 + 40000.0 = **302,000.0**\n\n## 4. Final Answer Format\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"302000.00\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5.
