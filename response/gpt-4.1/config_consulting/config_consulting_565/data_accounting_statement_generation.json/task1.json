Identify Cash on Hand Initial Value\n\nFrom the data:\n\n| id                 | type         | date       | amount    | ... |\n|--------------------|--------------|------------|-----------|-----|\n| Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | 3000000.0 |     |\n\nSo:\n\n- **Cash on Hand Initial Value = 3,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Determine All Cash on Hand Flows\n\nWe need to calculate all **actual Cash inflows** and **outflows** after the initial cash. The principle:\n\n- **Cash Inflows**: Receipts where `payment_method` is `Cash` or Cash is actually received.\n- **Cash Outflows**: Payments where `payment_method` is `Cash`.\n\n(We'll ignore \"Bank Transfer\" etc, as those affect bank deposits, not cash on hand. We'll also ignore \"Unpaid\" etc.)\n\n### 2.1.

Calculate the Final Cash on Hand\n\n**Formula:**  \nFinal Cash = Initial Cash + (Cash Sales) - (Cash Purchases) - (Cash Expenses)\n\nPlug in the numbers:\n\n- Initial Cash: 3,000,000.00\n- Cash Inflow (Sales): 807,094.96\n- Cash Outflow (Purchases): 1,096,000.00\n- Cash Outflow (Expenses): 606,586.01\n\nCalculation:\n\n1.  Initial + Cash Sales:  \n    3,000,000.00 + 807,094.96 = 3,807,094.96  \n2.  Subtract Cash Purchases:  \n    3,807,094.96 - 1,096,000.00 = 2,711,094.96  \n3.  Subtract Cash Expenses:  \n    2,711,094.96 - 606,586.01 = **2,104,508.95**\n\n---\n\n**Rounding to two decimal places:**\n\n- Final cash on hand: **2,104,508.95**\n\n---\n\n# Final Solution (JSON)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\", \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"2104508.95\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n**Explanation/Reasoning:**  \n- Start with the initial cash-on-hand balance.\n- Add all cash sales receipts.\n- Subtract all purchases and expenses paid in cash.\n- Result is the final calculated cash on hand at period end.\n\nIf you wish to double-check the numbers or want the exact line-by-line values, let me know!",
