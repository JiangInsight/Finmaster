In the provided transactions:\n\n- The entry `Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0` is **opening balance** of fixed assets, not a purchase during the period.\n- All entries with `type` or `product_name` involving \"Consulting\", \"Enterprise Solution\", \"Premium Consulting\", \"Standard Consulting\", or purchases from suppliers are for **services/products** (possibly inventory or expense) but are not capital expenditures (fixed assets).\n- No row has a type or clear field such as `\"Fixed Assets Purchase\"` or asset_name/type field with a fixed asset or capitalizable item.\n- Depreciation entries are not purchases.\n- There is **no explicit cash purchase of fixed assets during the period**.\n\n**Thus, the correct cash outflow on purchase of fixed assets during the period = \"0\"**.",
