(Cash at beginning)**\n\nBut we're to compute net increase from above movements (i.e., inflows - outflows = net change), not just ending balance.\n\nBut strictly, based on cash flows:\n\n- **Inflows:**  Sales receipts (cash only)  = +807,094.96\n- **Outflows:** Purchases (paid) + expenses (paid) = -1,382,000 - 585,869.26 = -1,967,869.26\n\nSo, **net cash decrease from operations:**  \n= Inflow - Outflow  \n= 807,094.96 - 1,967,869.26  \n= **-1,160,774.30**\n\nBut, the initial cash, and so on: but also include the net *investing and financing* cash flows:\n\nIs there anything else? (E.g. initial investment in fixed assets?)\n\n#### Initial\n- Cash deposit: +3,000,000\n- Bank deposit: +5,000,000\n- Fixed assets: -5,000,000     (from the initial transaction, but that's *non-current*, not a cash transaction at this point since the cash was probably used for fixed assets at the beginning. But in initial movements, 8M in, 5M out for fixed assets—so at opening, cash is 3M.)\n\nBut, let's check the norm (as in the first example): **initial cash & equivalents** is simply the sum of all cash and bank deposit lines, regardless of fixed assets purchase at that time.\n\nSo, out of **8,000,000** opening, **5,000,000** was spent on fixed assets as per initial journal, already posted at initial.\n\nIn the example, fixed asset entries appear as an initial non-cash change (since both cash and fixed assets were posted on Dec 31, and initial cash is reported as including the bank/cash deposits, and the fixed assets as a separate line).\n\nGiven this, **the opening balance is 8,000,000**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Final Calculation: Ending balance**\n\nAt the end of the period (no explicit ending cash or bank deposit entries), but we can compute:\n\n**Ending balance = Opening balance + cash inflows - cash outflows**\n\n= 8,000,000 + 807,094.96 - 1,382,000 - 585,869.26  \n= 8,000,000 + 807,094.96 - 1,967,869.26  \n= 8,807,094.96 - 1,967,869.26  \n= **6,839,225.70**\n\n**Net Increase = Ending Balance - Opening Balance = 6,839,225.70 - 8,000,000 = -1,160,774.30**\n\nAlternatively, as in the example, the answer is the **net movement** during the period, i.e. net increase = cash inflows - cash outflows.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Formatting the Solution**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"-1160774.30\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n### **(Double-check for other types of inflows/outflows)**\n\n#### Anything missed?\n- Loan receipt/repayment? None.\n- Cash to bank or bank to cash transfers? None noted.\n- Ignore Depreciation/Interest Receivable/Unpaid/Account Receivables/Payables.\n\nThus, calculations above should be correct per the conventions as in the provided example.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"-1160774.30\"} }\n```",
