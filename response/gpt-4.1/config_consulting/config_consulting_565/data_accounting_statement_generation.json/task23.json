Let's check S003 more carefully, focusing on product_id S003 and product_name Premium Consulting.*\n\nLet's go back and check systemactically.\n\nHere is a quick list, extracting from all sales:\n\n- Sale20240109017 | S003 | Premium Consulting | 1 | cost_amount=20000\n- Sale20240110019 | S003 | Premium Consulting | 1 | 20000\n- Sale20240110020 | S003 | Premium Consulting | 1 | 20000\n- Sale20240111022 | S003 | Premium Consulting | 1 | 20000\n- Sale20240113026 | S003 | Premium Consulting | 1 | 20000\n- Sale20240118037 | S003 | Premium Consulting | 1 | 20000\n- Sale20240119040 | S003 | Premium Consulting | 1 | 20000\n- Sale20240123048 | S003 | Premium Consulting | 1 | 20000\n- Sale20240127055 | S003 | Premium Consulting | 1 | 20000\n- Sale20240129060 | S003 | Standard Consulting (no)\n- Sale20240202063 | S003 | Premium Consulting | 1 | 20000\n- Sale20240203065 | S003 | Premium Consulting | 1 | 20000\n- Sale20240204069 | S003 | Premium Consulting | 1 | 20000\n\nThat's 13 × 20,000 = **260,000**\n\nBut up above, purchases were 15 units total = 300,000 purchased, so only 13 sold.\n\n#### Enterprise Solution (S004):\n\nNow S004:\n\n- Sale20240106009 | S004 | Enterprise Solution | 1 | 100,000\n- Sale20240106010 | S004 | Enterprise Solution | 1 | 100,000\n- Sale20240113025 | S004 | Enterprise Solution | 1 | 100,000\n- Sale20240116032 | S004 | Enterprise Solution | 1 | 100,000\n- Sale20240116033 | S004 | Enterprise Solution | 1 | 100,000\n- Sale20240118038 | S004 | Enterprise Solution | 1 | 100,000\n- Sale20240120042 | S004 | Enterprise Solution | 1 | 100,000\n- Sale20240122047 | S004 | Enterprise Solution | 1 | 100,000\n- Sale20240125050 | S004 | Enterprise Solution | 1 | 100,000\n- Sale20240125051 | S004 | Enterprise Solution | 1 | 100,000\n- Sale20240127056 | S004 | Enterprise Solution | 1 | 100,000\n- Sale20240125051 | already counted\n- Sale20240122047 | already counted\n- Sale20240127056 | already counted\n- Sale20240205071 | S004 | Enterprise Solution | 1 | 100,000\n- Sale20240202064 | S004 | Enterprise Solution | 1 | 100,000\n\nLet's count: \nThat's 14 × 100,000 = **1,400,000**\n\nWait: but our total purchases of S004: 12 units x 100,000 = 1,200,000; sales possibly include more than stock? But the cost_amount is always 100,000.\n\nWait: When checking above, purchases of S004:\n\n- Purchase20231231003: 2\n- Purchase20231231009: 3\n- Purchase20231231011: 2\n- Purchase20231231016: 2\n- Purchase20231231018: 2\n- Purchase20231231019: 3\n\nTotal: 2+3=5, plus 2=7, plus 2=9, plus 2=11, plus 3=14 (wait, previous count was wrong!
