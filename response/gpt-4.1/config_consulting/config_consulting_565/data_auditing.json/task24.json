problem. The invoice indicates \"Bank deposit\" of 5,000,000.0 is correct, and the others contradict the more regulated invoice record.\n- The repeated field inconsistencies between supplier ID and product ID for consulting purchases may be a mislabeling or misplacement, but these are not necessarily internal inconsistencies in a single row (more like cross-row database issues).\n- The main standout internal inconsistency is in `\"Purchase20231231016\"`, which per invoice should be 2.0 units Ã— 100,000 = 200,000.0, but row gives 229,816.27 total and unit price 104,498.26, so I include that as an example (from the provided risk issues), though it's near the end of the above data.\n- Many other transactions are consistent or the \"invoice\" is just a repeat of the row information.\n- For completeness, some sequential Purchase rows, which show consistent data but have shifted supplier/product ID fields, could be cross-row issues, not in-row inconsistencies.\n\nIf you want only the most clear-cut internal row inconsistencies (like the amount/unit price mismatch in `\"Purchase20231231016\"`) let me know!",
