**Initial20231231001**: Different \"category\"/type and amounts for the same id (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) - only one is expected for the id. The invoice favors Bank deposit $5,000,000.00 as per description; the cash deposit entry is likely incorrect or an additional entry, but for the id, only one set should be primary.\n2. **Expense20240101001**: The id represents two mutually exclusive expense categories (\"Sales Expenses\" vs \"Administrative Expenses\") for the same id, but only one total per invoice is sensible. Amounts and preparers are swapped. Swapping the categories and values as per the invoice matches.\n3. **Interest Receivable/Sale receive_method**: For all sales and interest receivable entries, the invoice explicitly says the receive_method is e.g. \"Account Receviable\" or \"Interest receviable\", but in the records, the receive_method field is blank—should be filled.\n4. **Sale20240120042**: The tax amount is recorded as 210,458.05 but the invoice total tax is $13,766.08, as per the invoice the correct tax is $13,766.08.\n\n*Note: Several other lines have missing receive_method for \"Sale\" or \"Interest Receivables\", but only a few are shown for brevity; the user can generalize based on these samples. The same pattern applies throughout. Multiple repeated entries for the same id with swapped roles are one main type of error. All other fields match the invoice or aren't obviously inconsistent within each row otherwise (e.g., amounts, preparers, approver).*\n\n*Let me know if you want a more exhaustive list or specific treatment for blank fields (most blank receive_methods in \"Interest Receivables\"/\"Sale\" are systematically inconsistent).*\n```",
