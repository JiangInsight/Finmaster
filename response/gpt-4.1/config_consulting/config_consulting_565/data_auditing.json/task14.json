This suggests an internal inconsistency in categorization or structuring.\n- For **Sale20240205070**:\n  - The invoice states the sale involved 1.0 unit at 9420.62, but the row lists recorded_quantity as 0.0 and amount as 0.0.\n  - The recorded_payment/receipt_status is \"Paid,\" but the invoice and context indicate the transaction was \"Unpaid.\"\n  - The receive_method should be \"Account Receviable\" as per invoice, but is empty in the entry.\n  - The tax, profit values are missing.\n  - These are clear inconsistencies to be corrected according to the invoice description.\n\n**Note**: Most other rows are consistent. This format lists only entries with internal inconsistencies/errors as identified per your instruction.",
