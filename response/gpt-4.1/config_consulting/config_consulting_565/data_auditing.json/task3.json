If we check the structure of other similar entries and Sale invoice descriptions, everything else matches up.\n\n4. **Fill Solution Template:**  \n   Only the payment/receipt_status field is in error. The other fields are left null, which matches the style of the provided example. The id is 'Sale20240129060'.\n\n5. **Format and Output:**  \n   The output matches the proper fields and approach as in the example.\n```",
