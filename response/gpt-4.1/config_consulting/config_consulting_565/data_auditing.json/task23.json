Interest20240114014\nOn inspection, both the **recorded amount** and **invoice amount** for Interest20240114014 are $424.08, and the **date** in both is 2024-01-14.  \n**No inconsistency is present in this row.** Earlier example in the \"problem\" gave a mismatched example ($16.43 vs $17.64 etc), but here the invoice matches the row.\n\n#### 2. Expense20240203001\n- **Recorded date**: 2024-02-20\n- **Invoice date**: 2024-02-03 → Date inconsistency\n- **Recorded amount**: 2669.86\n- **Invoice amount**: 2285.8 → Amount inconsistency\n\nOther fields (category, payment status, payment method, preparer, approver) match between the row and invoice.\n\n#### Summary Table\n- **Interest20240114014**: No internal inconsistency.\n- **Expense20240203001**: Inconsistency in **date** and **amount** fields:\n  - Correct date: 2024-02-03 (from invoice)\n  - Correct amount: 2285.80 (from invoice)\n\n#### Notes:\n- All other rows in the sample are consistent between row and invoice for category, amount, date, payment/receipt_status, payment method, quantity, unit price, receive method, preparer, approver, etc.\n- Supplier and product IDs/names in purchases, and customer IDs in sales, also match in both the row and the invoice, so no inconsistency is present there.\n\n**If only inconsistent rows are to be listed, then only Expense20240203001 needs output. If all are to be listed, then both entries can be given with no discrepancy fields for the consistent one (here, included both for strict instruction adherence).**\n\n---\n\nIf you want only rows **where an inconsistency is detected**, then the solution would be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": [\n  {\n    \"Original category\": \"Sales Expenses\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\",\n    \"Original date\": \"2024-02-03\",\n    \"Recorded date\": \"2024-02-20\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n    \"Original payment_method\": \"Cash\",\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Cash\",\n    \"Original quantity\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"\",\n    \"Original price\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded price\": \"\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"\",\n    \"Original amount\": \"2285.80\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"2669.86\",\n    \"Original tax\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded tax\": \"\",\n    \"Original profit\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded profit\": \"\",\n    \"Original Preparer\": \"Staff\",\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": \"Staff\",\n    \"Original Approver\": \"Director\",\n    \"Recorded Approver\": \"Director\",\n    \"id\": \"Expense20240203001\"\n  }\n]}\n```\nLet me know if you want this more filtered version.",
