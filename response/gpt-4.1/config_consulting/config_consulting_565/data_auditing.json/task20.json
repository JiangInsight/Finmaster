The correct price should be $14,983.40 as per the standardized/reliable invoice.\n- Other fields (tax, method, etc) match, meaning the main discrepancies are category and price.\n- This is the only entry in your data with clear internal inconsistency for both category and unit price.  \n- All other rows are consistent with their invoices or otherwise match.  \n- Solution lists every field in the required format, filling in empty strings for fields where neither source had a value.",
