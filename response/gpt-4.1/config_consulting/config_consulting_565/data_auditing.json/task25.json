The correct (\"Original\") values are those described in the standardized invoice.\n- For all other rows, the invoice matches the row fields, or any small rounding differences are ignorable and not substantive inconsistencies.\n- The rest of the fields in the entry align; thus they're included uncopied/unchanged for completeness, as in the provided format.\n- Only the fields with inconsistencies are filled in both Original and Recorded; the rest are included as context per your template.\n\n**If you want these as a flat dict instead of a list, use the first dict inside the list above. If more errors existed, each would get an entry in that list, as seen in the examples.**",
