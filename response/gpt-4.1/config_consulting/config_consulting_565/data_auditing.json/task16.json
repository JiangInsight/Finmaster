The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n   - However, the recorded amount is 472.82 (should be 419.64), and the status is 'Paid' (should be 'Unpaid'), and the receive_method is blank (should be \"Interest receviable\").\n4. **Output other fields for completeness:** All other fields are consistent or don't apply; just mark them as null or fill according to the template.\n\n_No other inconsistencies are observed in the sample provided. If there are more, repeat this process and add them to the array in the output._",
