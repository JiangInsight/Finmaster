All other important fields match the invoice.\n  \nNo other row in the displayed problem set exhibits multiple internal field inconsistencies in the way this one does, based on cross checking with the invoice column.\n\nIf you need the blank fields filled in with 'None', you may modify `\"Original date\": null, ...` to `\"Original date\": \"None\", ...` etc. as required. This is the key (and only) inconsistency in the table above.",
