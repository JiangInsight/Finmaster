first three rows with ID \"Initial20231231001\" are all for the same transaction but with different categories and amounts. The invoice describes three distinct items: cash deposit ($3,000,000.00), bank deposit ($5,000,000.00), and fixed assets ($5,000,000.00), but only one can be recorded per entry. All should have unique IDs, but here they have the same, suggesting inconsistency.\n- Similarly, the \"Expense20240101001\" appears with both \"Sales Expenses\" and \"Administrative Expenses\" recorded on the same date with different amounts; the invoice only mentions one total per transaction/date, not both, suggesting a swap or mis-entry.\n- For all other entries, the fields conform to the invoice narrative, so only the above entries manifest clear internal inconsistencies that can be reliably corrected based on the invoice description.\n",
