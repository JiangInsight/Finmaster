All other fields (date, payment method, etc.) match the pattern (no inconsistency).\n- Only this row is inconsistent in the provided table; all other entries either correctly reflect their invoice or do not have contradictions.\n\nIf more discrepancies are found, please specify or provide additional conflicting entries; according to the data shown, only this entry is internally inconsistent based on the invoice.",
