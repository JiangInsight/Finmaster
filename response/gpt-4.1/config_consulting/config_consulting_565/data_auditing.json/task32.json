For example, with records where roles (preparer/approver) swap for similar amounts on the same voucher id and date, or where the invoice narrative and the recorded fields diverge, the solution includes these as errors. For brevity, repeating patterns from serial splits not shown unless unique. Some edge cases may be omitted for clarity if too numerous and repetitiveâ€”let me know if you need strictly every possible pairing exhaustively!)",
