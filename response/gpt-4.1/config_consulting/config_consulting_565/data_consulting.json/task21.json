Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nPer the structure of both the financial statements provided and the example, FCF is calculated as the \"net increase\" (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, which—when there's no significant investing outlay—matches net cash flow from operating activities + net cash from investing activities.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -1,182,491.05\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -0.00\n\nThus,\n**FCF = -1,182,491.05**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Average Current Assets\n\n- Revenue: 3,956,433.90 (from income statement \"Main Business Revenue\")\n- Average Current Assets = (Initial + End) / 2\n\nFrom balance sheet:\n- Initial Current Assets: 8,000,000.00\n- End Current Assets: 9,982,261.98\n- Average = (8,000,000.00 + 9,982,261.98) / 2 = 8,991,130.99\n\nNow compute the ratio:\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = 3,956,433.90 / 8,991,130.99 ≈ 0.44 \n\n**However,** the example provided rounds this ratio to two decimal places and appears to use only \"Main Business Revenue\". For consistency, let's round:\n\n0.44 (rounded to two decimals, but in the prior example, they used 0.68 for 5,431,018.59 / 7,956,806.47; which matches the revenue/end current assets, but for turnover it's strictly average current assets. However, the example actually divides revenue by end current assets, so to align:**\n\nEnd Current Assets: 9,982,261.98  \nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = 3,956,433.90 / 9,982,261.98 ≈ 0.40\n\n---\n\n## **Final answers:**  \n- FCF: -1,182,491.05  \n- Current Assets Turnover Ratio: 0.40",
