The Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio formula is:  \n   **Receivables Turnover = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable**\n   \n2. Based on the data:\n   - Net Credit Sales (use Total/ Main Business Revenue): **3,956,433.90**\n   - Accounts Receivable at beginning (2023-12-31): **0.00**\n   - Accounts Receivable at end (2024-02-05): **3,149,338.94**\n   - Average Accounts Receivable = (0.00 + 3,149,338.94) / 2 = **1,574,669.47**\n   \n3. Plug into the formula:\n   - Accounts Receivable Turnover = 3,956,433.90 / 1,574,669.47 â‰ˆ **2.51**\n   \nHowever, **since there were zero receivables at the beginning (likely, all revenue is new receivables), some analysts use only the ending balance in this case.** But the common formula uses the average, leading to:\n\n   - **Accounts Receivable Turnover = 3,956,433.90 / 1,574,669.47 = 2.51** (rounded)\n\nUpon more careful review, the example in your prompt uses the average method, even when the beginning balance is zero. The main business revenue is used as Net Credit Sales; that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct ratio is:\n   - **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 2.51**\n\nThe earlier answer of 1.60 would be if you used the end balance only, which is not correct for this formula.\n\n**Final Corrected Output:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.51\"} }\n```",
