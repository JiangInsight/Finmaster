Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\nFormula:  \nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,182,491.05\n- Net Profit = 1,390,936.99\n\nCalculation:\n-1,182,491.05 / 1,390,936.99 ≈ -0.85\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\nFormula:  \nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Average Current Assets\n\n- Revenue (from income statement) = 3,956,433.90\n- Average Current Assets = (Beginning + Ending) / 2  \n  = (8,000,000.00 + 9,982,261.98) / 2  \n  = 17,982,261.98 / 2  \n  = 8,991,130.99\n\nCalculation:\n3,956,433.90 / 8,991,130.99 ≈ 0.44\n\n*But note:* In the example, they use two decimals (0.68 for 5.43M/7.95M), but let's follow the direct calculation:\n3,956,433.90 / 8,991,130.99 ≈ 0.44\n\nHowever, the example gives \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\" as \"0.68\" when the revenue is 5,431,018.59 and average current assets 7,978,903.24 (average of 8,000,000 and 7,956,806.47). This supports our calculation method.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Quick Ratio\nFormula:  \nQuick Ratio = (Cash + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet (ending amounts):\n- Cash on Hand: 2,103,508.95\n- Bank Deposits: 4,714,000.00\n- Accounts Receivable: 3,149,338.94\n- Interest Receivable: 15,414.09\n\nQuick Assets = 2,103,508.95 + 4,714,000.00 + 3,149,338.94 + 15,414.09 = 9,982,261.98\n\nCurrent Liabilities (ending): 499,821.72\n\nQuick Ratio = 9,982,261.98 / 499,821.72 ≈ 19.97\n\nBut in the example, inventory is excluded (there is none here, so all current assets are quick assets).\n\nActually, sum above is correct for quick assets, so  \n9,982,261.98 / 499,821.72 ≈ 19.97\n\nYet, this is very high and may be a typo in numbers. Recheck all steps. The balance sheet gives \"Total Current Assets\" as 9,982,261.98 and \"Total Current Liabilities\" as 499,821.72. With no inventories, the quick ratio equals current ratio, which explains the high value.\n\nThus, the answer for \"Quick Ratio\" is \"19.97\".\n\n---\n\n**But in the example, the quick ratio was 1.54 when their quick assets were 7,956,806.47 (including AR etc., without inventory) over 1,861,550.92 current liabilities. Ours, with no inventory, is the same as current, so 9,982,261.98/499,821.72 ≈ 19.97. Double check:**\n\n9,982,261.98 / 499,821.72 = 19.97\n\nHowever, in my earlier calculation of Turnover Ratio, I get 0.44, while the example uses Total Revenue / Average Curr Assets, so let's check the average:\n\n- Beginning Current Assets: 8,000,000.00\n- Ending Current Assets: 9,982,261.98\n- Average = (8,000,000 + 9,982,261.98) / 2 = 8,991,130.99\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover = 3,956,433.90 / 8,991,130.99 = 0.44\n\nBut to match the format shown in the example, perhaps only two decimal places are shown, so we return \"0.44\".\n\n#### FINAL OUTPUT:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-0.85\",\n    \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.44\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"19.97\"\n} }\n```\nAs requested, rounding to two decimals.",
