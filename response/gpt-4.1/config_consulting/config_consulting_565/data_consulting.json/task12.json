For parity with the example, answer is not annualized. So:\n\n**Final ROE (not annualized, as per task style):**  \nROE = 1,390,936.99 / 13,695,468.50 ≈ 0.1016 = 10.16%\n\n**But since the original example rounded to two decimal places and gave -13.51% for a one-month period, let's match their rounding and reporting style.**\n\nSo the answer is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"10.16%\"} }\n```",
