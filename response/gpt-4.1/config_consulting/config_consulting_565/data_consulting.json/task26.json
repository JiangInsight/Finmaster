Return on Equity (ROE)\nFormula:  \nROE = Net Profit / Average Owner's Equity\n\n- Net Profit = 1,390,936.99\n- Beginning Equity = 13,000,000.00\n- Ending Equity = 14,390,936.99\n- Average Equity = (13,000,000.00 + 14,390,936.99) / 2 = 13,695,468.495\n\nSo:\nROE = 1,390,936.99 / 13,695,468.495 ≈ 0.1015, or 10.15%\n\nHowever, since best practice is to show ending equity (for a single-period case) or average (for a multi-period), we use average, as above:\nFinal ROE = 10.15%, but let's use two digits as in the example. The example (see prompt) uses End Equity (e.g. -1645141.43 / 11354858.57 = -14.5%), but the answer given is -13.51%, suggesting use of average. We'll stick to average for consistency.\n\nActually, 1,390,936.99 / 13,695,468.495 = 0.10156 or 10.16%, which rounds to **10.16%**.\n\nBut examples show two decimal digits. Let's keep that.\n\n#### 2. Debt to Asset Ratio\nFormula:  \nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom balance sheet (ending):\n- Total Liabilities = 499,821.72\n- Total Assets = 14,890,758.71\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 499,821.72 / 14,890,758.71 ≈ 0.03356, or **0.03** (rounded to two decimal digits as in the example)\n\n#### 3. Gross Profit Margin\nFormula:  \nGross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Revenue\n\n- Gross Profit = 2,272,433.90\n- Revenue = 3,956,433.90\n\nGross Profit Margin = 2,272,433.90 / 3,956,433.90 ≈ 0.5747, or **57.47%**\n\n### Final filled values (rounded in line with prompt example):\n\n- ROE: 10.16%\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.03\n- Gross Profit Margin: 57.47%\n\n### Correction: The prompt's example shows to 2 decimals, but used \"-13.51%\" for -1645141.43 / 11354858.57 = -0.1449 = -14.49%, which is actually not matching the formula shown. However, **based on the numbers**, let's finalize our result as calculated.\n\nSo, the answer should be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '10.16%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Gross Profit Margin': '57.47%'} }\n```",
