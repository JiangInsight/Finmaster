The question asks for the value of total assets that are NOT expected to be realised or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle.  \n2. In accounting, these are most commonly classified as \"Non-current Assets\", which typically include items such as \"Fixed Assets\" (e.g., property, plant, equipment), and possibly \"Long-term Investments\", \"Intangible Assets\", etc.\n3. In the given problem, under the asset section, we see:\n   - Current Assets (cash, bank, receivables, inventory) â€“ these ARE expected to be realised in the operating cycle, so they are NOT included.\n   - Non-current Assets are grouped under \"Total Non-current Assets\", which is composed of \"Fixed Assets\" minus \"Accumulated Depreciation\" (as standard).\n4. From the table:\n   - \"Total Non-current Assets\"  \n     - Initial: 5,000,000.00 (2023-12-31)\n     - End: 4,908,496.73 (2024-02-05)\n5. This matches the requested category: assets not expected to be realised in the normal course of the operating cycle.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '4908496.73'} }\n```",
