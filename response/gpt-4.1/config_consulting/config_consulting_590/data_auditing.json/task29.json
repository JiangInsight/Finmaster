If you need matching for all split cases for expense and purchase lines, please advise for deeper analysis, but those are usually just ledger breakdown, not a contradiction. \n]}\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n- For `Initial20231231001` there are three rows with the same ID, date, but different descriptions (\"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\") and amounts (3000000/5000000/5000000) while the invoice only mentions one amount/type at a time. Since the `invoice` field is considered most reliable, the `recorded_category` and `recorded_amount` of the rows not matching their invoice are erroneous.\n\n- For the two \"Administrative Expenses\" entries on `Expense20240101001` with different amounts (7069.68 and 13381.35), this could be legitimate if the invoice lists separate expense lines rather than a sum—the data is not inconsistent within a single row, and both amounts, preparer, and so on align with each row’s invoice, so unless guidance says otherwise, these are not strictly inconsistent.\n\n**If more split cases need handling as errors instead of ledger splits, please specify.**",
