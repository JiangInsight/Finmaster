All other data (amount, receive_method, etc.) match other Interest Receivables, not sales. All other \"Interest Receivables\" on nearby dates have the same behavior and amount, so this is an internal category/coding error.\n- The correction is that the `recorded_type` should be \"Interest Receivables\".\n\n**Other rows in the provided data do not have a clear internal contradiction between invoice and structured fields that can be inferred as reliably as this. If you have more such specific possible mismatches, please specify.**",
