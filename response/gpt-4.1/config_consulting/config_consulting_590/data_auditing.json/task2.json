All other values appear aligned (amounts, supplier, product, etc).\n   - Thus, this is a clear date inconsistency where the date should match the invoice: \"2023-12-31\" (Original) vs \"2024-01-30\" (Recorded).\n\n---\n\n**There are many other possible duplicative issues and missing supplier/product mapping, but these are the clear internal inconsistencies/contradictions detectable via invoice-text-vs-row approach and within the given sample.**",
