Multiple transactions with id \"Initial20231231001\", but with different types and amounts (should be one unique transaction per id)—possible original was Bank deposit or Fixed Assets with 5000000.0, but record is Cash deposit and 3000000.0.\n2. For Interest20240106006, the invoice says $418.03 and “unpaid”, but in the row it is $487.12 and \"Paid\"—the invoice (being more reliable) suggests the correct data is $418.03 and \"Unpaid\".\n\nAll other fields (checked per invoice wording and math) match up internally. No inconsistencies for the rest.\n\n**Cleaned output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": [\n    {\n      \"Original category\": \"Bank deposit\",\n      \"Recorded category\": \"Cash deposit\",\n      \"Original date\": \"2023-12-31\",\n      \"Recorded date\": \"2023-12-31\",\n      \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"\",\n      \"Original payment_method\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded payment_method\": \"\",\n      \"Original quantity\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded quantity\": \"\",\n      \"Original price\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded price\": \"\",\n      \"Original receive_method\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded receive_method\": \"\",\n      \"Original amount\": \"5000000.0\",\n      \"Recorded amount\": \"3000000.0\",\n      \"Original tax\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded tax\": \"\",\n      \"Original profit\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded profit\": \"\",\n      \"Original Preparer\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded Preparer\": \"\",\n      \"Original Approver\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded Approver\": \"\",\n      \"id\": \"Initial20231231001\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Original category\": \"Fixed Assets\",\n      \"Recorded category\": \"Cash deposit\",\n      \"Original date\": \"2023-12-31\",\n      \"Recorded date\": \"2023-12-31\",\n      \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"\",\n      \"Original payment_method\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded payment_method\": \"\",\n      \"Original quantity\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded quantity\": \"\",\n      \"Original price\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded price\": \"\",\n      \"Original receive_method\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded receive_method\": \"\",\n      \"Original amount\": \"5000000.0\",\n      \"Recorded amount\": \"3000000.0\",\n      \"Original tax\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded tax\": \"\",\n      \"Original profit\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded profit\": \"\",\n      \"Original Preparer\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded Preparer\": \"\",\n      \"Original Approver\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded Approver\": \"\",\n      \"id\": \"Initial20231231001\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Original category\": \"Interest Receivables\",\n      \"Recorded category\": \"Interest Receivables\",\n      \"Original date\": \"2024-01-06\",\n      \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-06\",\n      \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n      \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n      \"Original payment_method\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded payment_method\": \"\",\n      \"Original quantity\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded quantity\": \"\",\n      \"Original price\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded price\": \"\",\n      \"Original receive_method\": \"Interest receviable\",\n      \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Interest receviable\",\n      \"Original amount\": \"418.03\",\n      \"Recorded amount\": \"487.12\",\n      \"Original tax\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded tax\": \"\",\n      \"Original profit\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded profit\": \"\",\n      \"Original Preparer\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded Preparer\": \"\",\n      \"Original Approver\": \"\",\n      \"Recorded Approver\": \"\",\n      \"id\": \"Interest20240106006\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
