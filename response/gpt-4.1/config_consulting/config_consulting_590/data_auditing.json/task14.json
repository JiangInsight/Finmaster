Duplication/Inconsistency for Initial20231231001:**\n- Three entries exist with id Initial20231231001, each with a different category and amount: Cash deposit (3,000,000), Bank deposit (5,000,000), Fixed Assets (5,000,000).\n- According to the invoice (narrative fields), each category has its own line, but the actual id in the record is the same. Normally, these should have different ids, or if the id is intended to be the same (open entry), then the amounts and descriptions need to match up.\n- Internal inconsistency: The most detailed and complete representation is in the invoice field.\n- Best estimate: The actual correct values for \"Original category\" and \"Original amount\" should come from each matching invoice description:\n    - For Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n    - For Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n    - For Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00\n- However, two entries (Bank deposit and Fixed Assets) have the same amount and id as Cash deposit, but with a different category, which is inconsistent. \n- We can note both the Bank deposit and Fixed Assets variant as mismatches.\n\n**2. Sale20240131045:**\n- The line has:\n  - recorded_amount: 0.0\n  - recorded_quantity: 0.0\n  - recorded_unit_price: 2255.8\n  - recorded_receive_method: Cash (in invoice) vs. Account Receviable (in table)\n  - recorded_payment/receipt_status: Unpaid (in table) vs. Paid (in invoice)\n- Invoice text: \"On January 31, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $2255.80, totaling $2255.80. The cost amount for this transaction was $1000.00, with a tax amount of $112.79, leading to a total amount due of $2143.01. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- Table fields:\n    - \"recorded_quantity\": 0.0 (but invoice says 1.0)\n    - \"recorded_amount\": 0.0 (but invoice says 2255.80)\n    - \"recorded_unit_price\": 2255.8 (good)\n    - \"recorded_receive_method\": Account Receviable, invoice says Cash\n    - \"recorded_payment/receipt_status\": Unpaid, but invoice says Paid\n    - \"recorded_tax_amount\": blank, invoice says 112.79\n- So, both quantity and amount are inconsistent with invoice, as is payment/receipt_status and receive_method.\n- Thus, we list all those as mismatches.\n\n**Note:** For all other lines, the values are consistent between the invoice (the 'most reliable' field) and the main record.\n\n**No quantity/amount errors in any other line are evident. No other invoice-related fields conflict with the table, according to the provided sample. Most other rows not listed here are internally consistent (either in single entry or the invoice matches the record). The few sales lines with clear field mismatches (e.g., Sale20240131045) are covered above.\n\n**The output is an array of such mismatched records.**",
