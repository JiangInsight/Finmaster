The instruction is to check each transaction for inconsistencies using the invoice text as ground truth (because invoices are highly reliable).\n2. In transaction id \"Sale20240110012\", the invoice says:  \n   - \"The cost amount for this transaction was $1000.00, with a tax amount of $96.27, leading to a total amount due of $1829.20.\"\n   - But `recorded_tax_amount` is 2168.12, which is much too high for a sale of $1925.47 and does not match the invoice.\n   - Therefore, the correct value should be $96.27 as stated by the invoice, and the recorded value of 2168.12 is an error.\n3. All other transactions do not contain internal inconsistencies in the given fields or match the invoice text.\n4. Fill the output json as per the template, only the known error is reported.\n5. Non-relevant fields are set to null.\n",
