All other fields are either consistent, not present, or not relevant to this discrepancy.\n\n*No other inconsistencies are found in the provided entriesâ€”each other entry's invoice matches the other fields.*\n\nIf more such discrepancies were found, the output entries would be listed as separate objects (elements) in the array.",
