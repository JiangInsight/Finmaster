However, the recorded profit is $206,879.33. Thus, this is an internal inconsistency (profit calculation error).\n- For other entries shown in the provided \"problem,\" the values match as per their respective invoice sentences and transaction fields, except for the item above.\n- The rest of the fields either match or are not out of line with the invoice, which is prioritized as the most reliable source as per instructions.\n\n**If only errors are to be listed (as in your provided example), then only the third record shown above (id=Sale20240111016) has a detected inconsistency.** Here is that minimal version:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-11\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-11\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Original payment_method\": \"\", \"Recorded payment_method\": \"\", \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Original price\": \"277286.94\", \"Recorded price\": \"277286.94\", \"Original receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\", \"Original amount\": \"277286.94\", \"Recorded amount\": \"277286.94\", \"Original tax\": \"13864.35\", \"Recorded tax\": \"13864.35\", \"Original profit\": \"177286.94\", \"Recorded profit\": \"206879.33\", \"Original Preparer\": \"\", \"Recorded Preparer\": \"\", \"Original Approver\": \"\", \"Recorded Approver\": \"\", \"id\": \"Sale20240111016\"}}\n```\n\nIf only errors are requested, use this version.
