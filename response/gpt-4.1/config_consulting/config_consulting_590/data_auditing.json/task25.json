The cost amount for this transaction was $1000.00, with a tax amount of $112.79, leading to a total amount due of $2143.01. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n   - recorded_type: \"Administrative Expenses\" (should be \"Sale\")\n   - recorded_date: \"2024-02-18\" (should be \"2024-01-31\")\n   - recorded_unit_price: \"2160.67\" (should be \"2255.80\", as per both amount and invoice)\n2. **Category mismatch:** 'Administrative Expenses' vs. 'Sale'\n   - Based on invoice and structure (unit price, quantity, cost, receive_method), \"Sale\" is correct.\n3. **Date mismatch:** '2024-02-18' vs. '2024-01-31'\n   - Invoice, id, and chronological order: \"2024-01-31\" is correct.\n4. **Price mismatch:** '2160.67' vs. '2255.80'\n   - 1.0 × 2255.80 = 2255.80 (matches \"recorded_amount\" and invoice).\n   - Thus, \"2255.80\" is correct.\n5. **Other fields (payment status, method, quantity, profit, preparer, approver):**\n   - Payment/receipt status: Both say \"Paid\" → OK.\n   - Payment method: recorded_payment_method is blank, invoice says \"Cash\".\n   - Quantity: Both 1.0 → OK.\n   - Profit, tax, amount: all align with invoice, or have single values.\n   - Preparer/Approver are blank—likely unrecorded, none better available.\n\nThus, all required fields corrected above.",
