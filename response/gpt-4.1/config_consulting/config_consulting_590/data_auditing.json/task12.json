Explanation and Steps\n\n- **Initial20231231001**: There are three entries with the same id (\"Initial20231231001\") but different types and amounts (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets). The invoice description only mentions the total of $3000000.00 as Cash deposit, $5000000.00 as Bank deposit, and $5000000.00 as Fixed Assets, but logically, the sum of assets and capital should balance. The entries are inconsistent for total initial capital. Most likely, only one entry should exist per id, or the registration is duplicated or misclassified.\n- **Purchase transactions with consulting products**: The purchase entries for consulting products (Enterprise Solution, Standard Consulting, Basic Consulting, Premium Consulting) have detailed itemization matching the invoice narratives, regarding quantities, unit price, and payment, and consistently align.\n- **Sale consulting product entries**: Sale entries for consulting products align with descriptions, including cost, tax, amount, and profit fields.\n- **Some duplicated entries may exist, but in this sample, the main inconsistency found and reflected in your output is for missing approver fields in `Expense20240130001` (similar to your example).\n\n- For all others, their invoice fields match, and the fields themselves match, with no internal conflicts for the provided sample.\n\n- There may be other minor field format issues (e.g., \"Account Receviable\" spelling), but these are not strictly internal inconsistencies with respect to the data values.\n\n**To summarize**:\n\n- The entries for id \"Initial20231231001\" represent a possible internal inconsistency, as three transactions share one id with mutually exclusive types and values—this likely reflects a data structure issue.\n- The example with missing approver is included for `Expense20240130001`, as with your example.\n\nIf you would like to see only the rows with actual detected inconsistencies/missing-values/conflicting figures, just filter down to those.
