This points to internal inconsistency: the total 'initial' amount should be split or categorized correctly, or the same amount should not appear in 'Bank deposit' and 'Fixed Assets' both as 5,000,000. The best estimate, based on the most reliable field (invoice text), is that the total initial capital on 2023-12-31 should be 8,000,000 (3M cash + 5M bank) and possibly 5M as Fixed Assets (perhaps overlapping). Flag this as an amount inconsistency across the three entries under the same id.\n\n2. **Sale20240112018**  \n   The invoice says receive_method is \"Account Receviable\", but in the row the recorded_receive_method is \"Cash\" and payment/receipt_status is not Paid. Therefore, the receive_method should match the more reliable invoice value: \"Account Receviable\" (should be \"Unpaid\"), not \"Cash\". This is a naming and status mistake.\n\n3. **Interest20240102002**  \n   The receive_method is \"Interest receviable\" in the invoice but is recorded as \"Interest receivable\" (different spelling, missing 'i'). This is a spelling/data entry consistency issue.\n\nOther fields in these examples do not show internal inconsistencies. If more are needed, continue in the same way for other non-matching invoice vs. record rows.",
