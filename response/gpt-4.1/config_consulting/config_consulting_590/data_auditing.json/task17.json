The cost amount for this transaction was $100000.00, with a tax amount of $9660.20, leading to a total amount due of $183543.86. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- But in the row, 'recorded_type' is \"Financial Expenses\" (should be \"Sale\"), and the 'recorded_receive_method' is \"Interest receivable\" (should be \"Cash\").\n- All other fields match the invoice (values, amount, quantity, tax, etc.).\n- Therefore, only 'category/type' and 'receive_method' are incorrect.\n- Fill the rest of fields as present, or blank (\"\") where not specified, to maintain format.",
