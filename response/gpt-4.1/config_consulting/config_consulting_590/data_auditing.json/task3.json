Many rows are consistent; the only critical error is in \"Expense20240116001\" where the payment/receipt_status does not match the invoice (says Unpaid in data, but Paid in invoice). The very first transaction ID \"Initial20231231001\" is an accounting opening entry that appears multiple times with different categories/types (Cash deposit/Bank deposit/Fixed Assets) and mismatched sums (sum to 13,000,000 but only 8,000,000 in deposits, which looks like a structural inconsistency). Similar results for other rows, but most are self-consistent. Other rows do not have strong internal mismatches according to invoice text.\n]}\n```\n**Rationale:**  \n- Only rows where there is an evident mismatch between fields that can be checked with invoice text (e.g., payment status says Paid/Unpaid in invoice vs. table), duplicated IDs with multi-category definition, or calculation mismatch are output.\n- For \"Expense20240116001\" (payment status), the table says Unpaid, but the invoice says Paid.\n- For \"Initial20231231001\", the opening balances should not appear in different categories for the same id with conflicting amounts; this is shown as a multi-row issue.\n- All other fields (amounts, unit prices, quantities, cost amounts, etc.) match their invoice descriptions.\n- If more specific mismatches are found in a more granular review, those would be added similarly.",
