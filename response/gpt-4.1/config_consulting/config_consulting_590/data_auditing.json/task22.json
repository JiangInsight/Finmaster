At minimum, only one row should exist for this ID. According to the invoice text, the correct context is likely either \"Cash deposit\" $3,000,000, \"Bank deposit\" $5,000,000, or \"Fixed Assets\" $5,000,000, but only one can be true per transaction ID.\n- In `Purchase20231231002`, the unit price given by invoice is $1000.00, but the recorded_unit_price is $910.93 and the date is off. Correct value per invoice is unit price $1000.00, date 2023-12-31.\n- Other transactions either match the reliable \"invoice\" field or do not show inconsistencies between key values.\n- Only fields with solid evidence (from the reliable invoice statement) have been filled; fields left blank if information is not found or is identical.\n\nIf you want only one output per transaction ID (instead of flagging all 3 rows for \"Initial20231231001\"), clarify that, but above gives all detected row-wise errors as per prompt.",
