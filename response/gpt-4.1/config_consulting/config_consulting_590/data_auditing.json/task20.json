Thus:\n  - The **Recorded category** should be \"Sale\".\n  - The **Recorded price** should be \"295859.81\" (to match invoice and calculated total).\n- All other entries in the presented set either have only minor variations (rounding of interest entries) or are consistent with their invoice description; only `Sale20240110013` stands out by having both a category and price/unit inconsistency. \n\nIf you wish for further detail or for all fields to be explicitly filled out with `None` if not applicable for every field, let me know!",
