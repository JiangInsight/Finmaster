It is paid by cash on 2024-01-11.\n- The recorded row lists category as \"Depreciation\", amount $209,798.42 (does not match invoice), date 2024-02-02 (doesn't match 2024-01-11), unit price $176,256.37 (not matching invoice), tax $163,184.55 (clearly wrong, far exceeds sales tax on the invoice and is implausible for that sale amount).\n- All values that should be standardized from the invoice are inconsistent except for quantity and payment method/status, receive method, and profit.\n- The correct values are those from the invoice, considered most reliable, so the mismatched fields are all corrected as above.\n```",
