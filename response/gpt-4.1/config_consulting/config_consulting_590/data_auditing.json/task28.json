Transaction ID: Sale20240110012\n- **Invoice** states: \"On January 10, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $1925.47, totaling $1925.47. The cost amount for this transaction was $1000.00, with a tax amount of $96.27, leading to a total amount due of $1829.20...\" and receive method is \"account receviable\".\n- **Recorded fields**:\n  - recorded_date: 2024-01-21 (**mismatch**: invoice says Jan 10, record says Jan 21)\n  - recorded_unit_price: 1681.76 (**mismatch**: invoice says 1925.47)\n  - recorded_amount: 2341.96 (**mismatch**: invoice says 1925.47)\n- **Recorded receive_method** is correct (\"Account Receviable\"), and quantity=1.0 matches.\n\n### All other entries:\n- Examined remaining transactions for fields that do not match reliable invoice fields (mainly quantity, unit price, amount, date).\n- All other transactions are internally consistent with their corresponding invoice, or if differing fields exist (such as small tax/interest deviations over time), they are as expected and not internal errors.\n- This makes **Sale20240110012** the only entry with actual field-level contradictions.\n\n### Fields\n- 'Original category', 'Original payment/receipt_status', etc. are not contradicted by invoice, so use null unless shown to be incorrect.\n- Quantity, Preparer, Approver: as in example, not contradicted, thus shown as recorded or null.\n- Main mismatches are:\n  - recorded_date, recorded_unit_price, recorded_amount\n\n### Thus, the only inconsistency is for Sale20240110012, as above.",
