Beginning balance of A/R (Dec 31, 2023)\n    2. Ending balance of A/R (Jan 31, 2024)\n- The data includes all sales on account (\"Account Receivable\") and no explicit collections, so \"Paid\" sales are not included in A/R.\n\n## Step 2: Find Beginning Balance of A/R\n\n### Any item on 2023-12-31 which is an Account Receivable (customer owes us as of 2023-12-31)?\nLet's search for 2023-12-31 sales with \"Unpaid\" or, usually, the opening balance is zero unless specified.\n\n- There are no sales entries on 2023-12-31; only \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\" and Purchases.  \n- Therefore, **Beginning A/R is 0.00.**\n\n## Step 3: Find Ending Balance at Jan 31, 2024\n\n- The ending balance is the total of all \"Account Receviable\" type sales up to Jan 31, 2024, that are unpaid/receivable as there is no evidence of collections within this data.\n\n### List all \"Sale\" rows from 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-31 with \"Account Receviable\" in \"receive_method\" (and \"Unpaid\" or leave blank for payments).\n\nExtract their \"amount\" field and sum.\n\n#### Let's identify relevant rows and amounts\n\n1. **Sale20240102001** – 284230.98 (Account Receviable)\n2. **Sale20240102002** – 274894.93 (Account Receviable)\n3. **Sale20240103004** – 287021.71 (Account Receviable)\n4. **Sale20240106006** – 180661.23 (Account Receviable)\n5. **Sale20240107008** – 2041.74 (Account Receviable)\n6. **Sale20240110012** – 1925.47 (Account Receviable)\n7. **Sale20240110013** – 295859.81 (Account Receviable)\n8. **Sale20240111015** – 2212.39 (Account Receviable)\n9. **Sale20240111016** – 277286.94 (Account Receviable)\n10. **Sale20240112018** – 13759.13 (Account Receviable)\n11. **Sale20240123031** – 2384.14 (Account Receviable)\n12. **Sale20240128037** – 241259.43 (Account Receviable)\n13. **Sale20240128038** – 264938.8 (Account Receviable)\n14. **Sale20240130040** – 216405.22 (Account Receviable)\n15. **Sale20240130041** – 272245.21 (Account Receviable)\n16. **Sale20240130042** – 2313.08 (Account Receviable)\n17. **Sale20240131044** – 241168.27 (Account Receviable)\n\nAnd possibly more, let's look for more sales with \"Account Receviable\" in \"receive_method\":\n\nCheck for \"Unpaid\" and \"Account Receviable\" (could be typos like \"Account Receviable\" and \"Account Receivable\", but field has \"Account Receviable\" everywhere).\n\nNow, also check for sales with \"Unpaid\"/receive_method blank, but given field, only rows listed should count as \"on account\".\n\n## Let's sum these:\n\n284230.98  \n+ 274894.93  \n+ 287021.71  \n+ 180661.23  \n+ 2041.74  \n+ 1925.47  \n+ 295859.81  \n+ 2212.39  \n+ 277286.94  \n+ 13759.13  \n+ 2384.14  \n+ 241259.43  \n+ 264938.8  \n+ 216405.22  \n+ 272245.21  \n+ 2313.08  \n+ 241168.27  \n\nNow add these up:\n\nLet's proceed carefully:\n\n1. 284230.98\n2. + 274894.93 = 559125.91\n3. + 287021.71 = 846147.62\n4. + 180661.23 = 1,026,808.85\n5. + 2041.74 = 1,028,850.59\n6. + 1925.47 = 1,030,776.06\n7. + 295859.81 = 1,326,635.87\n8. + 2212.39 = 1,328,848.26\n9. + 277286.94 = 1,606,135.20\n10. + 13759.13 = 1,619,894.33\n11. + 2384.14 = 1,622,278.47\n12. + 241259.43 = 1,863,537.90\n13. + 264938.8 = 2,128,476.70\n14. + 216405.22 = 2,344,881.92\n15. + 272245.21 = 2,617,127.13\n16. + 2313.08 = 2,619,440.21\n17. + 241168.27 = 2,860,608.48\n\n#### **Total = 2,860,608.48**\n\n## Step 4: Calculate (Increase) Decrease in A/R\n\nBeginning balance = 0  \nEnding balance = 2,860,608.48\n\n(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable = Ending - Beginning = 2,860,608.48 - 0 = **+2,860,608.48**  \nBut, for the CFS, \"Increase in Accounts Receivable\" is an outflow, thus it's shown as **negative**.\n\nSo,  \n**\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" = -2,860,608.48**\n\n## Step 5: Output in Required JSON\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-2860608.48\"} }\n```\n",
