Fixed Assets End**\n\n- Initial: 5,000,000\n- Depreciation:\n    - Jan 1: 45,747.38\n    - Feb 1: 45,744.93\n    - Total Depreciation: 45,747.38 + 45,744.93 = 91,492.31\n\n**End Fixed Assets: 5,000,000 - 91,492.31 = 4,908,507.69**\n\n---\n\n### **B. Purchases (for assets):**\n\nAll purchases seem to be immediately expensed or gained as consulting solutions (no inventory left, all are expended via sales or services).\n\n---\n\n### **C. Cash & Bank Calculation**\n\nRather than try to track every inflow/outflow, we use the \"indirect method\".\n- Final Cash/Bank = Initial Cash/Bank + Money Received (Sales Paid) + Other Inflows (if any) - Outflows (Purchases, Expenses Paid)\n- No indication of capital inflows or outflows.\n\nBut, since so many transactions are unpaid/receivable/payable, let's compute ending balances more systematically.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Compute Receivables**\n\n### **A. Account Receivable from Sales (Unpaid)**\n\nAll \"Sale\" entries with \"**Unpaid**\" or \"**Account Receviable**\" are to be included at amount column.\n\nGo through each \"Sale\" with \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Receivable\" and sum their \"amount\".\n\n#### **All Sales (Unpaid / Account Receivable)**\n\nBelow are the sales (filtered for \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Receviable\"; checking \"type\" column):\n\n- Sale20240102001 | 284,230.98 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n- Sale20240102002 | 274,894.93 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n- Sale20240103004 | 287,021.71 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n- Sale20240106006 | 180,661.23 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n- Sale20240107008 |   2,041.74 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n- Sale20240110012 |   1,925.47 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n- Sale20240110013 | 295,859.81 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n- Sale20240111015 |   2,212.39 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n- Sale20240111016 | 277,286.94 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n- Sale20240112018 |  13,759.13 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n- Sale20240123031 |   2,384.14 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n- Sale20240128037 | 241,259.43 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n- Sale20240128038 | 264,938.80 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n- Sale20240130040 | 216,405.22 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n- Sale20240130041 | 272,245.21 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n- Sale20240130042 |   2,313.08 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n- Sale20240131044 | 241,168.27 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n\nAdd these up:\n\nLet's add in chunks to avoid mistake.\n\nFirst group:\n- 284,230.98\n- 274,894.93\n- 287,021.71\n- 180,661.23\n-   2,041.74\n-   1,925.47\n- 295,859.81\n-   2,212.39\n- 277,286.94\n-  13,759.13\n-   2,384.14\n- 241,259.43\n- 264,938.80\n- 216,405.22\n- 272,245.21\n-   2,313.08\n- 241,168.27\n\nAdd them:\n\nLet's do it step by step:\n\n1. 284,230.98\n2. + 274,894.93 = 559,125.91\n3. + 287,021.71 = 846,147.62\n4. + 180,661.23 = 1,026,808.85\n5. + 2,041.74 = 1,028,850.59\n6. + 1,925.47 = 1,030,776.06\n7. + 295,859.81 = 1,326,635.87\n8. + 2,212.39 = 1,328,848.26\n9. + 277,286.94 = 1,606,135.20\n10. + 13,759.13 = 1,619,894.33\n11. + 2,384.14 = 1,622,278.47\n12. + 241,259.43 = 1,863,537.90\n13. + 264,938.80 = 2,128,476.70\n14. + 216,405.22 = 2,344,881.92\n15. + 272,245.21 = 2,617,127.13\n16. + 2,313.08 = 2,619,440.21\n17. + 241,168.27 = 2,860,608.48\n\n**Total Accounts Receivable = 2,860,608.48**\n\n---\n\n### **B.

Sum of all sales paid in cash (\"Sale\" with receive_method = \"Cash\")**\n\nWith \"receive_method\" = \"Cash\", sum \"amount\":\n\nFrom above data, check each \"Sale\":\n\n- Sale20240108010 | 285,922.71 | Cash\n- Sale20240111017 | 193,204.06 | Cash\n- Sale20240204049 | 11,896.81 | Cash\n- Sale20240127036 | 2,203.63 | Cash\n- Sale20240131045 | 2,255.80 | Cash\n\nBut also, many other sales have \"Paid\" in payment/receipt_status and \"Cash\" in receive_method, but also many have \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Receivable\", which we considered as receivables only.\n\nFrom the result, only sales with **receive_method = Cash** should go to cash, and \"Paid\" in \"payment/receipt_status\".\n\nSo we also have these:\n\n- Sale20240108010 | 285,922.71 | Cash | Paid\n- Sale20240111017 | 193,204.06 | Cash | Paid\n- Sale20240131045 | 2,255.80 | Cash | Paid\n- Sale20240204049 | 11,896.81 | Cash | Paid\n- Sale20240127036 | 2,203.63 | Cash | Paid\n\nSum them:\n- 285,922.71\n- + 193,204.06 = 479,126.77\n- + 2,255.80 = 481,382.57\n- + 11,896.81 = 493,279.38\n- + 2,203.63 = 495,483.01\n\nBut wait: earlier there were more sales with \"Cash\" receive method and \"Paid\", let's check for any missed ones. Look for all sales with \"Cash\" as receive_method and \"Paid\" status only. \n\nSearching for more, but from the given shortlist only these are present.\n\nSo, **Total Sales Collected in Cash: 495,483.01**\n\n(A note: in the broader dataset, other sales are with \"Unpaid\" status or \"Account Receivable\" receive method, which we added as receivables.)\n\n---\n\n### **B.
