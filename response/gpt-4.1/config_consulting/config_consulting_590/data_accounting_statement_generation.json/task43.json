But since all relevant items are available (cash receipts from customers, cash payments to suppliers, cash expenses, etc.), we can use the **direct method**.\n\n**1. Summarize types of transactions related to Operating Activities:**\n\n### Cash Inflows (Operating):\n- **Cash received from customers:** Only sales marked as \"Paid\" and with \"Cash\" (or blank, since nowhere does it say bank transfers or non-operating receipts).\n  - Sometimes the \"Paid\" sales have \"Cash|Bank Transfer\" or just \"Paid\", but from the structure and in line with similar examples, let's assume \"Cash\" or blank is a cash operating receipt.\n\n### Cash Outflows (Operating):\n- **Cash paid to suppliers:** Purchases marked as \"Paid\" with \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" (for operating items, i.e., non-fixed asset purchases).\n- **Operating expenses paid in cash:** All administrative, sales, financial expenses marked as \"Paid\" with \"Cash\".\n\n### Other Cash Flows:\n- Purchases of fixed assets are not included in operating but in investing (ignore for operating section).\n- Depreciation is non-cash, only affects adjustments (here, can be ignored in direct method cash flow since it doesn't involve cash).\n- Ignore \"Interest Receivable\" for direct cash flow unless collected in cash.\n- Ignore changes in \"Accounts Receivable\" and \"Accounts Payable\" unless reconciling via indirect method (no evidence of direct cash collections from AR or cash payments for AP, so this matches with direct method and the data structure).\n- \"Bank Deposits\", \"Cash Deposits\", and initial balances are not operating cash flows but rather opening cash and bank balances.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Cash Received from Customers**\n\n**Paid Sales (with cash):**\n\nLet's scan only \"Sale\" lines where \"payment/receipt_status\" is \"Paid\" (or not \"Unpaid\") and \"receive_method\" is \"Cash\" or blank.\n\nLet's extract all such sales (showing id, amount):\n\n- Sale20240108010 | Sale | 2024-01-08 | amount: 285922.71 | Paid | Cash\n- Sale20240111017 | Sale | 2024-01-11 | amount: 193204.06 | Paid | Cash\n- Sale20240127036 | Sale | 2024-01-27 | amount: 2203.63 | Paid | Cash\n- Sale20240131045 | Sale | 2024-01-31 | amount: 2255.8 | Paid | Cash\n- Sale20240204049 | Sale | 2024-02-04 | amount: 11896.81 | Paid | Cash\n\n_(Other Sales are all unpaid or not \"Cash\" received)_\n\n**Sum of cash sales:**\n- 285,922.71\n- 193,204.06\n- 2,203.63\n- 2,255.80\n- 11,896.81\n\nTotal = 285,922.71 + 193,204.06 + 2,203.63 + 2,255.80 + 11,896.81  \nTotal = 495,483.01\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Cash Paid to Suppliers (Purchases with status Paid in Cash/Bank Transfer)**\n\nWe need all \"Purchase\" lines (not Fixed Asset purchases) with \"Paid\" as payment status.\n\nPurchases:\n- Purchase20231231001 | amount: 300,000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n- Purchase20231231002 | amount: 2,000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n- Purchase20231231003 | amount: 300,000.0 | Paid | Cash\n- Purchase20231231004 | amount: 1,000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n- Purchase20231231005 | amount: 200,000.0 | Paid | Cash\n- Purchase20231231007 | amount: 3,000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n- Purchase20231231011 | amount: 200,000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n- Purchase20231231015 | amount: 2,000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n- Purchase20231231017 | amount: 10,000.0 | Paid | Cash\n\n**Do NOT include:**\n- Purchase20231231006 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231008 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231009 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231010 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231012 (Paid | Bank Transfer) (but include, as it’s Paid)\n- Purchase20231231013 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231014 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231016 (Unpaid)\n\n- Purchase20231231012 | amount: 200,000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n\n**Sum all paid amounts:**\n- 300,000.0\n- 2,000.0\n- 300,000.0\n- 1,000.0\n- 200,000.0\n- 3,000.0\n- 200,000.0\n- 2,000.0\n- 10,000.0\n- 200,000.0\n\nSum:\n300,000.0  \n+ 2,000.0 = 302,000.0  \n+ 300,000.0 = 602,000.0  \n+ 1,000.0 = 603,000.0  \n+ 200,000.0 = 803,000.0  \n+ 3,000.0 = 806,000.0  \n+ 200,000.0 = 1,006,000.0  \n+ 2,000.0 = 1,008,000.0  \n+ 10,000.0 = 1,018,000.0  \n+ 200,000.0 = 1,218,000.0  \n\nTotal Purchases Paid = **1,218,000.0**\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Cash Paid for Operating Expenses**\n\nInclude all lines of type \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Sales Expenses\", \"Financial Expenses\" paid with \"Cash\".\n\nLet's sum up all these expenses.
