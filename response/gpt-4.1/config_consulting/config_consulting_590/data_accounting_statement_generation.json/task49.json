None here (all services/consulting only).\n\n#### 11. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**\n- 0.00\n\n#### 12. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**\n- 0.00\n\n#### 13. **Cash and Cash Equivalents**\n- N/A for movement, but tracked for completeness.\n\n#### 14. **Beginning Balance**\n- From initial cash + initial bank = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000.00\n\n#### 15. **Ending Balance**\n- Beginning - Net cash out (Operating + Investing + Financing) = 8,000,000 - 2,296,982.87 = 5,703,017.13\n\n#### 16. **Net Increase**\n- Ending - Beginning = -2,296,982.87\n\n---\n\n**Assumptions**:\n- No fixed asset purchases in the period.\n- All purchases are treated as inventory/services consumed.\n- AR/AP increases calculated from unpaid sales/purchases at period end.\n- Cash expenses as paid; only 'Paid' rows affect actual cash outflows.\n- No cash inflows on sales (mostly unpaid); only cash balance at beginning and outflows shown.\n- Tax Payable not offset by payments, so total increases by sales tax accrued.\n\nIf a more detailed break-down or worksheet is required, let me know!",
