Regular 'Purchase' entries for goods/services/consulting are NOT fixed assets, they are operating expenses or inventory.\n\n2. **Review the data:**\n   - The only entries in the sample labeled as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or \"Fixed Assets\" are:\n     - `| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | ... | 5000000.0 | ...` – But this is an initial balance, not a cash flow activity within the period.\n   - All purchases recorded as \"Purchase\" pertain to products like consulting, enterprise solution, premium consulting, standard consulting, etc.; there is no explicit machinery, equipment, buildings, etc. mentioned.\n   - No entry named \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar indicating cash actually paid for a fixed asset.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**  \n   - No CASH OUTFLOW for purchase of fixed assets is recorded during the period provided.  \n   - Therefore, the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" for the cash flow statement is **0**.\n\n**If at a future time, an entry like `| ... | Fixed Assets Purchase | ... | ... | amount | ... |` appears, that amount would be used.**",
