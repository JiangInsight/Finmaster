What is included in Non-current Assets for this problem?\n- Fixed Assets at initial date.\n- Fixed Assets purchased during the period.\n- **Less:** Accumulated Depreciation during the period.\n\nFrom the given data, only one asset is explicitly a \"Fixed Asset\" (non-current asset). All consulting and enterprise solutions are services, not assets, so they are not counted in non-current assets for the balance sheet.\n\n## 2. Find the Initial Value\n\nFrom the data:\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5,000,000.0 |\n\nSo, **Total Non-current Assets Initial Value = 5,000,000.00**\n\n## 3. Additions to Fixed Assets during the period\n\nLook for any purchases of fixed assets. There are several \"Purchase\" lines, but they're for services (\"Enterprise Solution\", \"Basic Consulting\", etc.), except:\n\nNone of these purchases or sales are for asset items (e.g., \"Storage Facilities\")â€”they are software/services. So, for this dataset, from the descriptions, there is **no new addition** to Fixed Assets.  \n\n**(If you had a row like \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or a tangible asset, you'd add it here.)**\n\n## 4. Deduct Depreciation\n\nCheck for \"Depreciation\" entries:\n\n- Depreciation20240101001: amount = 45,747.38\n- Depreciation20240201002: amount = 45,744.93\n- No other depreciation entries found.\n\n**Total Depreciation = 45,747.38 + 45,744.93 = 91,492.31**\n\n## 5. Compute End Value\n\n**End Value = Initial Value + Additions - Depreciation**\n\nNo asset additions, so:\n\n**End Value = 5,000,000.00 - 91,492.31 = 4,908,507.69**\n\n---\n\n## Final JSON Solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"4908507.69\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n**Reasoning**:  \n- Initial Non-current Assets are the \"Fixed Assets\" of 5,000,000.  \n- No asset (tangible) additions during period.\n- Depreciation charged for two months: 45,747.38 + 45,744.93 = 91,492.31.\n- Final Non-current Assets = 5,000,000.00 - 91,492.31 = 4,908,507.69.",
