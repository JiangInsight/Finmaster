What are “Current Assets”?\nTypical current assets (within one year and not fixed asset) include:\n- Cash\n- Bank deposit (including deposit accounts)\n- Account Receivable (money customers owe you)\n- Interest Receivable (accrued interest to collect)\n- Inventory (goods not sold, but for simplicity in this type of consulting business, purchases of consulting services are usually expensed not held in inventory)\n- Other short-term investments (not present here)\n\n**Do not include Fixed Assets.**\n\n## 2. Find Initial Current Assets\nFrom the initial entries:\n- | Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | ... | 3000000.0 |\n- | Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | ... | 5000000.0 |\n- | Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | ... | 5000000.0 |\n\n**Current assets at start:**\n- Cash: 3,000,000\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000\n- (Ignore Fixed Assets)\n\n**So, initial total = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000**\n\n## 3. Find Current Assets at End (Step by Step)\n\nLet's maintain:\n\n- **Cash**\n- **Bank deposit**\n- **Account Receivable**\n- **Interest Receivable**\n\n### (A) Cash & Bank: Direct Movements\n\n#### Inflows to Cash/Bank:\n- Sales with \"Paid\" (added to \"cash\" or \"bank\" depending)\n- Any other cash inflow not related to noncurrent assets\n\n#### Outflows:\n- Purchases (reduce cash/bank if \"Paid\")\n- Expenses (reduce cash/bank if \"Paid\")\n- Transfers between cash & bank (don't change total current assets, just move between two current assets)\n- Purchases/Expenses \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Payable\" do NOT immediately reduce cash/bank (but may create account payable, not current asset).\n- Depreciation: only impacts fixed assets, not current asset (ignore for cash).\n\n**In this scenario, all purchases/sales relate to consulting/software, no inventory tracking as a store.**\n\n#### Tracking logic:\n- Start with:\n    - Cash: 3,000,000\n    - Bank: 5,000,000\n\nEvery \"Paid\" expense reduces Cash/Bank accordingly; \"Sales\" increase as \"Received\" **if Paid**, otherwise increase Accounts Receivable.\n\nDo not double-count sales proceeds for credit sales: they go to account receivable until collected.\n\n**Because there is no detail indicating when AR is later collected, unless a subsequent \"Paid\" shows up later for unpaid sales, assume AR grows and is not paid within period.**\n\n#### Transfers:\nNo evidence of \"Transfer\" rows in the table.\n\n### (B) Account Receivable\n\n- All \"Sales\" with \"Unpaid\" (receipt_status=\"Unpaid\") and receive_method \"Account Receivable\" are AR increases.\n\n#### Calculate AR at end:\n- Add up all sales with Unpaid status (i.e., not immediately paid) to customers.\n\n#### If a subsequent \"Paid\" for a previously unpaid sale appears, you would reduce AR and increase Cash/Bank accordingly. In this data, each sale is line-by-line; unless a particular sale changes status, it's safer to just sum up AR on all \"Unpaid\" for the period.\n\n### (C) Interest Receivable\n\n- All \"Interest Receivables\" lines add to interest receivable asset.\n\n#### Calculate Interest Receivable:\n- Sum up all \"Interest Receivables\".\n\n### (D) Purchases Do Not Create Inventory\n\n- In a consulting/software company, purchases are expensed as incurred, not held as inventory, unless otherwise specified.\n\n### (E) Account Payable (Liability, ignore for current assets)\n\n- Unpaid purchases are payables, not current assets. Ignore for asset calculation.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Now, Let's Compute Each Asset at the End\n\n### 4.1. Cash and Bank Calculation\n\n#### A) Initial Cash/Bank\n- Cash: 3,000,000\n- Bank: 5,000,000\n\n#### B) Expenditures Paid: Reduce Cash/Bank\n\nGo through all \"Expense\" and \"Purchase\" lines with \"Paid\" and payment_method (\"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\"), and subtract from corresponding cash/bank.\n\n#### C) Sales Receive: \"Paid\"\nAdd all \"Sales\" lines with \"Paid\" and \"receive_method\"=\"Cash\"/bank, to appropriate asset.\n\n#### Note: If \"Paid\" but no payment_method given, we can assume \"Cash\" if \"receive_method\" is \"Cash\", else \"Bank\" or \"Cash\" (ambiguous), but as in the data \"receive_method\" seems to reflect whether it's immediate cash or AR.\n\n### 4.2. Account Receivable\n\nAdd up all sales with \"Unpaid\" and \"receive_method\"=\"Account Receivable\".\n\n### 4.3. Interest Receivable\n\nAdd all \"Interest Receivables\" lines.\n\n---\n\nLet’s process in detail!\n\n---\n\n### Step A: Subtract Outflows from Cash/Bank (Expense/Purchase = Paid)\n\nList all **Expenses** and **Purchases** with Paid status, by payment method\n\n- For each: Paid amount (in \"amount\"), payment_method (Cash or Bank Transfer)\n\n#### Purchases:\n\nPurchases with Paid:\n\n| Type       | ID            | Date       | Amount    | Payment Method | Paid  |\n|------------|---------------|------------|-----------|---------------|-------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | ... | ... | 300,000 | Bank Transfer | Paid |\n| Purchase20231231002 | ... | ... | 2,000   | Bank Transfer | Paid |\n| Purchase20231231003 | ... | ... | 300,000 | Cash         | Paid |\n| Purchase20231231004 | ... | ... | 1,000   | Bank Transfer | Paid |\n| Purchase20231231005 | ... | ... | 200,000 | Cash         | Paid |\n| Purchase20231231007 | ... | ... | 3,000   | Bank Transfer | Paid |\n| Purchase20231231011 | ... | ... | 200,000 | Bank Transfer | Paid |\n| Purchase20231231015 | ... | ... | 2,000   | Bank Transfer | Paid |\n| Purchase20231231017 | ... | ... | 10,000  | Cash         | Paid |\n| Purchase20231231012 | ... | ... | 200,000 | Bank Transfer | Paid |\n\nNow sum per \"Cash\" and \"Bank Transfer\":\n\n**Cash Purchases:**\n- Purchase20231231003: 300,000\n- Purchase20231231005: 200,000\n- Purchase20231231017: 10,000\nTotal: 300,000 + 200,000 + 10,000 = 510,000\n\n**Bank Transfer Purchases:**\n- Purchase20231231001: 300,000\n- Purchase20231231002: 2,000\n- Purchase20231231004: 1,000\n- Purchase20231231007: 3,000\n- Purchase20231231011: 200,000\n- Purchase20231231012: 200,000\n- Purchase20231231015: 2,000\nTotal: 300,000 + 2,000 + 1,000 + 3,000 + 200,000 + 200,000 + 2,000 = 708,000\n\n#### Expenses (Paid)\n\n| Type | Date | Amount | Payment Method | Paid? |\n|------|------|--------|---------------|-------|\n\nNow, go through Expense rows:\n\nFor each Expense row, if \"Paid\" and payment_method is \"Cash\", subtract from cash; if \"Bank Transfer\", subtract from bank; otherwise, assume cash (since almost all are cash).\n\nGo through ALL Expense rows in the data (search for \"Expense\" rows):\n\n- 2024-01-01:\n  - Admin 7069.68 (Cash) -> Cash\n  - Admin 13381.35 (Cash) -> Cash\n- 2024-01-02:\n  - Admin 18522.55 (Cash)\n  - Sales 13305.95 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-03:\n  - Sales 11861.78 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-04:\n  - Admin 7550.68 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-05:\n  - Finance 7928.54 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-06:\n  - Sales 13930.48 (Cash)\n  - Admin 17921.98 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-07:\n  - Sales 12925.57 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-08:\n  - Sales 8666.24 (Cash)\n  - Admin 16893.65 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-09:\n  - Admin 9840.4 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-10:\n  - Finance 9001.74 (Cash)\n  - Sales 14246.91 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-11:\n  - Finance 7754.91 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-12:\n  - Sales 16705.92 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-13:\n  - Sales 19270.58 (Cash)\n  - Sales 3803.96 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-14:\n  - Admin 16654.12 (Cash)\n  - Admin 4461.27 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-15:\n  - Sales 19701.69 (Cash)\n  - Sales 13134.95 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-16:\n  - Sales 13669.93 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-17:\n  - Sales 10766.33 (Cash)\n  - Admin 12390.55 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-18:\n  - Admin 17013.85 (Cash)\n  - Sales 5600.05 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-19:\n  - Sales 8771.29 (Cash)\n  - Admin 18333.0 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-20:\n  - Sales 10538.58 (Cash)\n  - Sales 17948.72 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-21:\n  - Admin 17959.24 (Cash)\n  - Sales 11989.77 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-22:\n  - Financial 3133.97 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-23:\n  - Admin 2784.18 (Cash)\n  - Admin 13728.52 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-24:\n  - Admin 19421.61 (Cash)\n  - Sales 8398.64 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-25:\n  - Sales 5737.39 (Cash)\n  - Admin 3082.57 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-26:\n  - Sales 14261.76 (Cash)\n  - Sales 5081.0 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-27:\n  - Admin 3882.45 (Cash)\n  - Finance 4579.76 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-28:\n  - Sales 3342.58 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-29:\n  - Admin 6121.99 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-30:\n  - Sales 6484.02 (Cash)\n  - Admin 15370.59 (Cash)\n- 2024-01-31:\n  - Sales 16033.09 (Cash)\n  - Sales 13137.94 (Cash)\n- 2024-02-01:\n  - Finance 15308.56 (Cash)\n- 2024-02-02:\n  - Sales 8191.03 (Cash)\n  - Admin 15719.57 (Cash)\n- 2024-02-03:\n  - Admin 13782.27 (Cash)\n- 2024-02-04:\n  - Sales 3938.06 (Cash)\n  - Sales 8383.91 (Cash)\n- 2024-02-05:\n  - Finance 6837.24 (Cash)\n\nHow many are bank transfer?
