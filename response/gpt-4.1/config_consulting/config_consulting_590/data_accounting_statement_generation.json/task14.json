What are \"Current Liabilities\"?\nCurrent liabilities typically include:\n- Account Payables (short-term debts to suppliers)\n- Other short-term payables/unpaid expenses\n\nReview the given data:\n- We look for **Purchase** transactions and **Payment status = Unpaid** (i.e., Account Payable)\n- Sometime there may be other Current Liabilities, but per data and Example, **only Account Payable/unpaid Purchases are included**.\n\n> **Note:** Ignore \"Interest Receivables\" – these are assets, not liabilities!\n> Similarly, do not count \"Paid\" purchases or expenses – paid expenses already left cash/bank.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Find Initial (2023-12-31) Current Liabilities\n\nSearch for *Purchase* with *Unpaid* on or before 2023-12-31.\n\nFrom the table, Initial period entries:\n| id                 | type     | date        | payment/receipt_status | payment_method   | amount    | supplier_id |\n|------------------|-------|---------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Purchase20231231006 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 |     Unpaid            | Account Payable  | 5000.0    | S007        |\n| Purchase20231231008 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 |     Unpaid            | Account Payable  | 2000.0    | S001        |\n| Purchase20231231009 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 |     Unpaid            | Account Payable  | 200000.0  | S006        |\n| Purchase20231231010 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 |     Unpaid            | Account Payable  | 200000.0  | S003        |\n| Purchase20231231013 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 |     Unpaid            | Account Payable  | 5000.0    | S008        |\n| Purchase20231231014 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 |     Unpaid            | Account Payable  | 10000.0   | S009        |\n| Purchase20231231016 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 |     Unpaid            | Account Payable  | 40000.0   | S002        |\n\nSum those up:\n\n- 5000.0 (S007)\n- 2000.0 (S001)\n- 200000.0 (S006)\n- 200000.0 (S003)\n- 5000.0 (S008)\n- 10000.0 (S009)\n- 40000.0 (S002)\n\nTotal:\n= 5000 + 2000 + 200000 + 200000 + 5000 + 10000 + 40000 \n= 462,000.0\n\n**So, Initial Current Liabilities: 462,000.00**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Find End-of-Period (2024-01-31) Current Liabilities\n\nFind all *UNPAID PURCHASES* up to and including 2024-01-31 that are still unpaid.\n\nLet’s check for subsequent payments of these initial payables (i.e., did they get paid off?).\n**BUT:** There are NO payments marked against them (no purchase with same ID and status \"Paid\"). In most scenarios, unless separately shown as paid, it's assumed unpaid.\n\nAlso, look for ANY new *UNPAID* purchases in January. But as per data, all Purchases after 2023-12-31 are either Paid or not existing.\n\n**Reviewing carefully, all Purchases after 2023-12-31 are \"Paid\".**\n\nSo, current liabilities at **end** of January 2024 would be the **same initial unpaid purchases**, unless:\n- There are specific payments (e.g. Expense/Payment/Manual Cash/Bill Payment) settling them.\n- Or, there’s any evidence these payables are paid. But in provided data, there are no explicit \"payment of accounts payable\" entries. Most Expenses also do not reference supplier/payable IDs, so we cannot definitely attribute the payments.\n\nTherefore, **All previously unpaid PURCHASES** remain unpaid.\n\n### List:\n- Purchase20231231006 | 5000.0\n- Purchase20231231008 | 2000.0\n- Purchase20231231009 | 200000.0\n- Purchase20231231010 | 200000.0\n- Purchase20231231013 | 5000.0\n- Purchase20231231014 | 10000.0\n- Purchase20231231016 | 40000.0\n\nSum: 462,000.0\n\n## **Confirm for other liabilities**\nIf there were unpaid expenses (e.g. Expense with \"Unpaid\" status), they could count. But all Expenses are \"Paid\".\n\n---\n\n## 4. Final Solution Format\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"462000.00\", \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"462000.00\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Therefore, the answer is:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"462000.00\", \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"462000.00\"}}\n```",
