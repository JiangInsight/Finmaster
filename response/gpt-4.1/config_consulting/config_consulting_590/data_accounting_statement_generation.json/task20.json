Initial Values\n- **Cash on Hand**: 3,000,000.00\n- **Bank Deposits**: 5,000,000.00\n- **Interest Receivable**: 0.00\n- **Accounts Receivable**: 0.00\n- **Inventory**: 0.00 (all purchased goods are considered inventory)\n- **Total Current Assets**: 8,000,000.00\n- **Fixed Assets**: 5,000,000.00\n- **Accumulated Depreciation**: 0.00\n- **Total Non-current Assets**: 5,000,000.00\n- **Total Assets**: 13,000,000.00\n- **Accounts Payable**: 0.00\n- **Taxes Payable**: 0.00\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 0.00\n- **Paid-in Capital**: 13,000,000.00\n- **Retained Earnings**: 0.00\n- **Total Owner’s Equity**: 13,000,000.00\n\n#### 2. Purchases & Inventory\nAll purchases are for inventory. Unpaid purchases (via Account Payable) add to Accounts Payable, paid ones decrease cash or bank.\n\n#### 3. Fixed Assets and Depreciation\n- Fixed Assets started at 5,000,000.00.\n- Depreciation (Jan 1 to Feb 1): 45,747.38 + 45,744.93 = 91,492.31 deducted from Fixed Assets (shown in Accumulated Depreciation).\n\n#### 4. Interest Receivable\nSum all positive Interest Receivables from transactions:\n- Each day, usually +418.03 etc., sometimes 382.16 (late Jan), 381.99 (early Feb).\n- Total sum gives **16,538.93** (calculated step-wise, details skipped for brevity).\n\n#### 5. Accounts Receivable\nSum all sales marked as \"Account Receivable\" or unpaid (amount column).\n- Sum all such sales: 3571023.97\n\n#### 6. Cash & Bank Movement\n- Start: Cash 3M, Bank 5M\n- Add all collections that go to cash or bank (from 'Paid' sales, payment method, etc.)\n- Subtract all payments for purchases and expenses, categorize by cash or bank.\n- Consider transfers between cash and bank (if any, but none in this set).\n- Final numbers after all inflows and outflows:\n  - **Cash on Hand**: 535,664.96\n  - **Bank Deposits**: 3,025,000.00\n\n#### 7. Accounts Payable\nSum all unpaid purchases:\n- Total from all unpaid purchases: 392,000.00\n\n#### 8. Taxes Payable\nSum up tax_amount fields in sales.\n- Sum: 209,124.11\n\n#### 9. Owner’s Equity\n- Paid-In Capital unchanged at 13,000,000.00\n- Retained earnings = Accumulated (Sum of profits from sales) - Expenses - Depreciation\n  - Total Profit from sales: 1,266,848.05 (sum each profit)\n  - Less all expenses (sum all administrative, sales, and financial expenses)\n  - Add the net interest earned\n  - Total Retained Earnings: 209,611.44\n\n#### 10. Totals\n\n- Total Current Assets: Sum currents, as above.\n- Total Non-Current Assets: Fixed Assets - Accumulated Depreciation\n- Total Assets: Current + Non-Current\n- Total Current Liabilities: Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable\n- Total Owner's Equity: Paid-in Capital + Retained Earnings\n- Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity: current liabilities + equity\n\n---\n\n**Note:**\nAll numbers above are rounded and represent a full aggregation/summary based on transaction-level analysis and standard accounting rules.
