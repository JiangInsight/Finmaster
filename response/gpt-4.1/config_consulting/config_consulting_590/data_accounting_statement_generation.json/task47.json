For sales, only those with `payment/receipt_status` or `payment_method` indicating that cash has been received.\n\n#### 2.1 Sales Received in Cash\n\nFilter sales rows with \"Cash\" or empty payment_method and either paid or unspecified status - but only those with cash actually received.\n\nLooking at your data, there is one sale that's clearly \"Cash\":\n- Sale20240108010: payment_method=Cash, amount=285,922.71\n\nAlso:\n- Sale20240111017: payment_method=Cash, amount=193,204.06\n- Sale20240127036: payment_method=Cash, amount=2,203.63\n- Sale20240131045: payment_method=Cash, amount=2,255.80\n- Sale20240204049: payment_method=Cash, amount=11,896.81\n\nCheck if there are any other sales with payment_method=\"Cash\" (from your formatted view, looks like only these).\n\n#### 2.2 Other Cash Receipts\nThere are no explicit \"Other Receipts\" like loan proceeds, etc., in your table.\n\n### Step 3: Find All Cash Outflows\n\nNow, find every line with payment_method = \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" that is \"Paid\". These are outflows.\n\n#### 3.1 Purchases paid via Cash or Bank Transfer\n\n- Purchase20231231001: Paid, Bank Transfer, amount=300,000.00\n- Purchase20231231002: Paid, Bank Transfer, amount=2,000.00\n- Purchase20231231003: Paid, Cash, amount=300,000.00\n- Purchase20231231005: Paid, Cash, amount=200,000.00\n- Purchase20231231007: Paid, Bank Transfer, amount=3,000.00\n- Purchase20231231011: Paid, Bank Transfer, amount=200,000.00\n- Purchase20231231015: Paid, Bank Transfer, amount=2,000.00\n- Purchase20231231017: Paid, Cash, amount=10,000.00\n- Purchase20231231012: Paid, Bank Transfer, amount=200,000.00\n\n#### 3.2 Expenses paid via Cash\n\nSum all rows with \"Expense...\" and payment_method = \"Cash\":\nLet’s add all amounts for \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Sales Expenses\", and \"Financial Expenses\" that are marked Paid and payment_method=Cash.\n\nFrom your data, starting from Expense20240101001:\n\n- 2024-01-01: Adm Exp: 7,069.68\n- 2024-01-01: Adm Exp: 13,381.35\n- 2024-01-02: Adm Exp: 18,522.55\n- 2024-01-02: Sales Exp: 13,305.95\n- 2024-01-03: Sales Exp: 11,861.78\n- 2024-01-04: Adm Exp: 7,550.68\n- 2024-01-05: Financial Exp: 7,928.54\n- 2024-01-06: Sales Exp: 13,930.48\n- 2024-01-06: Adm Exp: 17,921.98\n- 2024-01-07: Sales Exp: 12,925.57\n- 2024-01-08: Sales Exp: 8,666.24\n- 2024-01-08: Adm Exp: 16,893.65\n- 2024-01-09: Adm Exp: 9,840.40\n- 2024-01-10: Financial Exp: 9,001.74\n- 2024-01-10: Sales Exp: 14,246.91\n- 2024-01-11: Financial Exp: 7,754.91\n- 2024-01-12: Sales Exp: 16,705.92\n- 2024-01-13: Sales Exp: 19,270.58\n- 2024-01-13: Sales Exp: 3,803.96\n- 2024-01-14: Adm Exp: 16,654.12\n- 2024-01-14: Adm Exp: 4,461.27\n- 2024-01-15: Sales Exp: 19,701.69\n- 2024-01-15: Sales Exp: 13,134.95\n- 2024-01-16: Sales Exp: 13,669.93\n- 2024-01-17: Sales Exp: 10,766.33\n- 2024-01-17: Adm Exp: 12,390.55\n- 2024-01-18: Adm Exp: 17,013.85\n- 2024-01-18: Sales Exp: 5,600.05\n- 2024-01-19: Sales Exp: 8,771.29\n- 2024-01-19: Adm Exp: 18,333.00\n- 2024-01-20: Sales Exp: 10,538.58\n- 2024-01-20: Sales Exp: 17,948.72\n- 2024-01-21: Adm Exp: 17,959.24\n- 2024-01-21: Sales Exp: 11,989.77\n- 2024-01-22: Financial Exp: 3,133.97\n- 2024-01-23: Adm Exp: 2,784.18\n- 2024-01-23: Adm Exp: 13,728.52\n- 2024-01-24: Adm Exp: 19,421.61\n- 2024-01-24: Sales Exp: 8,398.64\n- 2024-01-25: Sales Exp: 5,737.39\n- 2024-01-25: Adm Exp: 3,082.57\n- 2024-01-26: Sales Exp: 14,261.76\n- 2024-01-26: Sales Exp: 5,081.00\n- 2024-01-27: Adm Exp: 3,882.45\n- 2024-01-27: Financial Exp: 4,579.76\n- 2024-01-28: Sales Exp: 3,342.58\n- 2024-01-29: Adm Exp: 6,121.99\n- 2024-01-30: Sales Exp: 6,484.02\n- 2024-01-30: Adm Exp: 15,370.59\n- 2024-01-31: Sales Exp: 16,033.09\n- 2024-01-31: Sales Exp: 13,137.94\n- 2024-02-01: Financial Exp: 15,308.56\n- 2024-02-02: Sales Exp: 8,191.03\n- 2024-02-02: Adm Exp: 15,719.57\n- 2024-02-03: Adm Exp: 13,782.27\n- 2024-02-04: Sales Exp: 3,938.06\n- 2024-02-04: Sales Exp: 8,383.91\n- 2024-02-05: Financial Exp: 6,837.24\n\n#### 3.3 Totaling All Cash-based Purchases & Expenses Paid\n\nLet’s total each:\n\n##### Purchases Paid Out (sum of Paid, via Cash or Bank Transfer):\n- 300,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n- 2,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n- 300,000.00 (Cash)\n- 200,000.00 (Cash)\n- 3,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n- 200,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n- 2,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n- 10,000.00 (Cash)\n- 200,000.00 (Bank Transfer)\n\nSum:\n= 300,000 + 2,000 + 300,000 + 200,000 + 3,000 + 200,000 + 2,000 + 10,000 + 200,000\n= 1,217,000.00\n\n##### Additional Purchases Paid via Cash (from Purchase20231231017 - 10,000.00 and Purchase20231231003 - 300,000.00): Already counted above.\n\n##### Expenses Paid Out via Cash\n\nSum up all the values in the expense list above.
