However, all \"Initial...\" lines have nothing about accounts payable, only deposits and fixed assets.\n\nSo, opening A/P = 0.\n\n**Step 4: Thus, the increase in Accounts Payable is 462,000.00** (all unpaid Payables as of end).\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer JSON:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"462000.00\"} }\n```",
