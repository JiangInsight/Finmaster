The requirement is to extract the specific line items and value of total assets that are NOT expected to be realised or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle.\n2. These are, by definition, non-current assets (i.e., long-term assets such as Fixed Assets, minus Accumulated Depreciation, and any other non-current assets, but not current assets like cash, receivables, inventory).\n3. In the given balance sheet, the relevant section is:\n   - Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00 (initial and end)\n   - Accumulated Depreciation: 91,492.31 (end only; initial is 0)\n   - Total Non-current Assets: 5,000,000.00 (initial), 4,908,507.69 (end)\n4. \"Total Non-current Assets\" is calculated as Fixed Assets minus Accumulated Depreciation (and any other non-current asset, if present).\n5. Per the question, present initial (\"initial value\") and final (\"end value\") as the \"Total Non-current Assets\" line.\n\n## Solution\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '4908507.69'} }\n```",
