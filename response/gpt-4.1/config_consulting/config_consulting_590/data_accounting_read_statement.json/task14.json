We are to identify and extract the specific line items and total amount of liabilities that are expected to be settled in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle.\n2. On a balance sheet, these are the \"Current Liabilities,\" which include items such as Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable. The sum is usually shown as \"Total Current Liabilities.\"\n3. We need the initial and final value of \"Total Current Liabilities\".\n\nFrom the provided balance sheet:\n- | Total Current Liabilities | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 631880.98 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nTherefore:\n\n- initial value: '0.00'\n- end value: '631880.98'\n\nSo the answer is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"631880.98\"} }\n```",
