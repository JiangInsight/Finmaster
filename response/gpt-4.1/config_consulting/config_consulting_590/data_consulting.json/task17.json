Here, from the balance sheet, \"Total Current Liabilities\" is the only reported liability (631,880.98).\n\n2. **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:**  \n   From cash flow statement: -1,368,775.90\n\n3. **Total Debt:**  \n   From balance sheet: 631,880.98\n\n4. **Calculate Ratio:**  \n   = -1,368,775.90 / 631,880.98 â‰ˆ -2.166\n\n5. **Round to two decimal places:**  \n   = -2.17\n\n**Therefore, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is -2.17.**",
