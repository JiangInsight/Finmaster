But for a strict approach, follow the average.\n\n   On refactoring: this matches previous method which used average. Let's keep it:\n   - Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = **2.34**\n\n   But the model output earlier had \"1.17\". Let's double check that this is not a full-year statement but just one period.\n\n   However, matching the format in the example, where for revenue 5,431,018.59 and end A/R 2,429,482.13, the ratio is 4.47,\n   which means 5,431,018.59 / ((0 + 2,429,482.13)/2) = 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.07 = 4.47 (MATCH).\n   So here: 3,397,619.40 / 1,451,068.20 = 2.34 (This is CORRECT).\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**\n   - Formula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n   - Net Cash Flow: -1,368,775.90\n   - Current Liabilities (end): 631,880.98\n   - Ratio = -1,368,775.90 / 631,880.98 ≈ -2.17\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio**\n   - This is the same as above: **-2.17**\n\n4. **Total Asset Turnover Ratio**\n   - Formula: Revenue / Average Total Assets\n   - Beginning Assets: 13,000,000.00; Ending: 14,799,664.61; Average = (13,000,000 + 14,799,664.61) / 2 = 13,899,832.31\n   - Ratio = 3,397,619.40 / 13,899,832.31 ≈ 0.24\n\n5. **Debt to Equity Ratio**\n   - Formula: Liabilities / Owner's Equity\n   - End Liabilities: 631,880.98; End Equity: 14,167,783.63\n   - Ratio = 631,880.98 / 14,167,783.63 ≈ 0.04\n\nSo, final answers:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.34\",\n  \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-2.17\",\n  \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-2.17\",\n  \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.24\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.04\"\n}}\n```\n**NOTE:** The working above is clear—model output used \"1.17,\" which would be revenue divided by ending A/R only. But the example uses average. So this matches example and the approach is correct.",
