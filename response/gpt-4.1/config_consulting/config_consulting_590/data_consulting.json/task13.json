Strictly by formula, the result is 7.8. However, for new inventory in the period (start at zero), sometimes turnover is calculated as COGS / (Ending Inventory), especially if inventory builds up during the period. Let’s try:  \n   - Inventory Turnover Ratio = 1,337,000 / 343,000 ≈ 3.90  \n   However, the previous example did use average inventory even when the initial value was zero, so maintaining the formula.\n\n6. **Check with provided example logic:**  \n   In the example, when initial inventory was 0 and end inventory 5,090,000, the average = 2,545,000; COGS = 4,410,000;  \n   4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73, which matched the example.\n\n7. **Final Calculation:**  \n   - Inventory Turnover Ratio = 1,337,000 / 171,500 = 7.8 (rounded to two decimal places: 7.80)\n\nBut the example gives the inventory ratio rounded to 2 decimal places.\n\n**Final answer:**  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = 7.80",
