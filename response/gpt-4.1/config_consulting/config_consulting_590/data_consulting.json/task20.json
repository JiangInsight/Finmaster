Gross Profit Margin\nGross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Revenue) × 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 2,060,619.40\n- Revenue = 3,397,619.40\n\nCalculate:\nGross Profit Margin = (2,060,619.40 / 3,397,619.40) × 100%  \nGross Profit Margin ≈ 0.6066 × 100%  \nGross Profit Margin ≈ 60.66%\n\n---\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,368,775.90\n\nFrom the balance sheet (current at period end):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 631,880.98\n\nCalculate:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -1,368,775.90 / 631,880.98 ≈ -2.17\n\nHowever, examples express to two decimals or to the nearest tenth. Let's calculate with one decimal:\n-1,368,775.90 / 631,880.98 ≈ -2.17\n\nBut looking at the example mapped (similar negative scenario) is rounded to \"-3.90\" for a much higher negative, but for this, proper rounding is:\n-2.17 rounds to \"-2.17\" or \"-2.2\".  \nBut, per example, they use two decimals, so let's leave it as \"-2.17\".\n\nBut your format in the problem expected something like \"-0.40\" (double check calculation):\n\n(-1,368,775.90) / 3,397,619.40 (possible alternative denominator: revenue) = -0.40\n\nBut by strict definition, it should be vs. current liabilities, as per example. Let's check example:\n\nIn the example:\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,259,994.10  \nTotal Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92  \nRatio: -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 = -3.90 (which matches their solution).\n\nApply formula directly:\n\n-1,368,775.90 / 631,880.98 = -2.17\n\nSo, the correct answer should be:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"Gross Profit Margin\": \"60.66%\", \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-2.17\"} }\n\nBUT in your original solution above you used \"-0.40\", which is Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Revenue. That is NOT the standard calculation.\n\n**Official formulas:**\n- Gross Profit Margin: (Gross Profit / Revenue)\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\n**Therefore, final correct answer is:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Gross Profit Margin\": \"60.66%\", \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-2.17\"} }\n```",
