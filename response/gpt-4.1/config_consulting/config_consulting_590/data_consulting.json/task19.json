But best practice would use average; however, to be consistent with the example:\n\n   In the example, ending inventory was used (5,090,000), and COGS was 4,410,000: \\(4,410,000 / 2,545,000 = 1.73\\) – they averaged the ending (5,090,000) and starting (0) inventory. So average inventory is correct.\n\n   Let's recalculate for certainty:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{0 + 343,000}{2} = 171,500\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{1,337,000}{171,500} \\approx 7.80\n   \\]\n\n   So the correct answer is not 6.51 but **7.80**.\n\n   Let's verify:  \n   1,337,000 / 171,500 = 7.799\n\n   Therefore, the solution should be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Current Ratio\": \"15.66\", \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"7.80\"} }\n```",
