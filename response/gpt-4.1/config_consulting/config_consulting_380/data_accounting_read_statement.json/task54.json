In typical financial statement terminology:\n- \"Selling Expenses\" usually include costs related to securing customer orders and delivering goods/services (such as sales personnel salaries, advertising, shipping, etc.).\n- \"Cost of Goods Sold\" relates to the production or purchase of goods, not the costs of securing or fulfilling orders.\n\nFrom the provided income statement, the line item \"Selling Expenses\" with the value 402699.98 best represents these costs.",
