The first entry in the solution lists a mismatch with supplier/product fields, but reviewing the invoice, the mismatch is not substantiveâ€”the entry as written is correct as per invoice, so that one could be omitted. The actual error among the sample is for the sale transaction above, so that's output as per the instructions. All other sample entries have matching amount and price, thus no error is reported.\n\n**Therefore, the primary error is:**\n- `Sale20240113022` has an incorrect amount and unit price. The correct value should be $55716.09 for both `recorded_amount` and `recorded_unit_price`.\n\n**Final concise output for only inconsistencies:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": [\n  {\n    \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Original date\": \"2024-01-13\",\n    \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-13\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n    \"Original payment_method\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": \"\",\n    \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"1.0\",\n    \"Original price\": \"55716.09\",\n    \"Recorded price\": \"60732.42\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n    \"Original amount\": \"55716.09\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"63219.71\",\n    \"Original tax\": \"2785.80\",\n    \"Recorded tax\": \"2785.80\",\n    \"Original profit\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded profit\": \"\",\n    \"Original Preparer\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": \"\",\n    \"Original Approver\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded Approver\": \"\",\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240113022\"\n  }\n]}\n```",
