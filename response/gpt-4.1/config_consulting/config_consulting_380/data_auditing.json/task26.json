}\n]}\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The only true inconsistencies per the standardized invoice narrative, compared to the \"recorded\" details, are in the two \"Purchase\"-typed rows (which should be Sales/Administrative Expenses) on \"Expense20240126001\" and \"Expense20240127001\"; the date, category, and amount disagree, and the invoice narrative provides the 'original' values.\n- All other sample rows presented have \"recorded\" fields matching the invoice statement or, where there are double details, seem to align on key fields.\n- If you'd like to see detailed detection for supplier/customer ID mismatches in the Purchase lines, or other similar data for all lines, let me know, but as per the pattern established in your sample and instruction, the above format covers the key detected inconsistencies.",
