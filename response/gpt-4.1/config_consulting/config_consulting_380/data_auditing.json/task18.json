This is supported by cross-referencing product names and supplier IDs found in other consistent entries.\n- For the sale with a zero quantity, both amount, unit price, and invoice comment show it should be 1 unit; also, the payment status and profit were inconsistent with what the reliable invoice text suggests.\n- Only entries with internal inconsistencies per the reliable invoice were included. For most 'interest receivable', 'expense', and 'sale' transactions, no internal field contradiction was found except those already noted.",
