The invoice text matches each (e.g., \"an invoice was issued for a Bank deposit of $5,000,000\").\n   - The correct practice: Each unique transaction should have a unique ID; here, it looks like the 'Initial' entry is being split into assets and cash/bank but with clashing IDs and values.\n   - These lines should not share an ID. Also, the values for Fixed Assets and Bank deposit redundantly both use 5,000,000, which may indicate a misposting for cash/bank vs assets.\n   - **Internal inconsistency:** category/amount and ID don't match; should be split or IDs clarified.\n\n2. **Expense20240125001 (\"Original Preparer\": \"Staff\", \"Recorded Preparer\": \"None\")**\n   - In the presented data, the entry for id \"Expense20240125001\" is missing a recorded preparer, but the invoice narration says \"prepared by Staff\".\n   - Fix: The correct value should be \"Staff\" as original.\n\n3. **Expense20240201001 (\"Original Preparer\": \"Supervisor\", \"Recorded Preparer\": \"None\")**\n   - Same preparer mismatch as previous, document indicates \"prepared by Supervisor\", but the field is none.\n\n4. **Many other rows appear accurate, and match narrations/invoice values to table values, so no issue for them.**\n\n*If required, more issues can be noted (e.g., systematic errors in supplier_id vs product_id confusion in some rowsâ€”but the problem scoped for direct exact row inconsistencies.*",
