The receive_method is as per invoice.\n- Therefore, the main internal inconsistencies are in \"category/type\" and \"date\". The correct category should be \"Interest Receivables\" and the correct date \"2024-01-30\". The rest is either missing or matches.\n\n*Other records in this batch either do not show any internal mismatch between invoice and row fields or have consistent data.*",
