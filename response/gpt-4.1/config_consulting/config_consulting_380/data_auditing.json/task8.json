For many of the \"Purchase\" records, either the supplier_id and supplier_name do not match the invoice, or the product_id and supplier fields are swapped, e.g. S002/S009, S003/S001 etc. The invoice description is trusted to have the correct supplier, and so the recorded supplier_name/ID fields are mismatched from invoice.\n2. For Expense20240112001, the invoice describes a total of $7688.36, but the recorded_amount is $8636.23, which is a clear amount discrepancy. The correct value should be $7688.36.\n3. All other numeric/logic fields (quantity × unit_price, tax fields, etc.) from the available sample do not contradict invoices directly except as noted in example Expense20240112001; but supplier mismatches recur across multiple purchase transactions.\n\n## Note:\nIf you wish to flatten the output to show only inconsistent entries, you may remove the entries with all-null fields except the one inconsistency, as done for the amount error above. But for the common \"supplier/product\" field mismatch between record and invoice (a pattern unique to your sample data, misalignment between supplier and product id/description), I've shown examples as requested for both S002/S009, etc, and similar patterns for others.\n",
