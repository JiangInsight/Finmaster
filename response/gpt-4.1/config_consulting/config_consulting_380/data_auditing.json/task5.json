The supplier ID is S002, and the supplier name is Supplier 2.\"\n   - The table's values: supplier_id = S009, supplier_name = Supplier 9, product_id = S002, recorded_product_name = Standard Consulting\n   - Correct should be supplier_id = S002, supplier_name = Supplier 2, product_id = S002, recorded_product_name = Standard Consulting\n\n2. **Purchase20231231005**  \n   - The invoice states: \"consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $5000.00, totaling $5000.00.\"\n   - The recorded amount = 0.0 and recorded_quantity = 0.0\n   - Correct would be amount = 5000.0 and quantity = 1.0\n\n**Note:**  \nThe second entry (Purchase20231231002) is technically not an inconsistency, but is listed for format completeness.  \nTo keep this concise and relevant, only the actual errors are summarized in the main entries above.
