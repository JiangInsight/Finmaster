(Likely should be S009/Supplier 9's correct service.)\n- But the key fields (*quantity, unit price, amount, payment method/status, date, etc*) are consistent with the invoice and the row.\n- There is no numerical inconsistency here; the most probable cause is a data entry error in *product_id* and *product_name* fields: S002/Standard Consulting, should align with S009/Supplier 9.\n- However, since all numbers and key transactional fields match, and the instructions specifically focus on invoice amounts, prices, categories, payment/receipt, etc, thereâ€™s no direct numerically contradictory field.\n- Therefore, skip unless strictly about amount/price/quantity/critical financial field.\n- **No discrepancy detected in price/quantity/amount** for this row. The data matches invoice text.\n\nNow check for other rows specifically mentioned in risk_issues:\n\n1. **Sale20240126050:**\n   - \"risk_issues\": [ {'Original price': 58733.47, 'Recorded price': 66792.34, 'id': 'Sale20240126050'} ] \n   - Means: Invoice says price/unit should be 58733.47, but `recorded_unit_price` is 66792.34.\n   - So inconsistency: recorded_unit_price = 66792.34, should be 58733.47.\n\nTherefore, output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Original category\": \"Sale\", \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\", \"Original date\": \"2024-01-26\", \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-26\", \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \"Original payment_method\": \"\", \"Recorded payment_method\": \"\", \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Recorded quantity\": \"1.0\", \"Original price\": \"58733.47\", \"Recorded price\": \"66792.34\", \"Original receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\", \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\", \"Original amount\": \"58733.47\", \"Recorded amount\": \"58733.47\", \"Original tax\": \"2936.67\", \"Recorded tax\": \"2936.67\", \"Original profit\": \"38733.47\", \"Recorded profit\": \"38733.47\", \"Original Preparer\": \"\", \"Recorded Preparer\": \"\", \"Original Approver\": \"\", \"Recorded Approver\": \"\", \"id\": \"Sale20240126050\"}}\n```",
