The payment_method of this transaction was bank transfer, and this transaction was paid. This transaction was prepared by Supervisor, and the approver is Director. The supplier ID is S007, and the supplier name is Supplier 7.\"\n\n- In the row:  \n  - recorded_date = 2024-01-30 (should be 2023-12-31 per invoice)  \n  - recorded_unit_price = 16274.12 (should be 20000.0 per invoice)  \n  - recorded_amount = 44832.96 (should be 40000.0 per invoice)  \n\n- Other fields, although some might also look odd (e.g., asset_name, profit, etc.), cannot be judged without more context, and the invoice does not mention them.\n\nThus, the above solution lists all fields where there's an inconsistency between \"recorded\" and \"invoice\"/\"risk_issues\". All others are set to None.",
