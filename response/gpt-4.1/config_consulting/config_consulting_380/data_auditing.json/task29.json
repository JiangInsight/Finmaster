The cost amount for this transaction was $100000.00, with a tax amount of $13658.45, leading to a total amount due of $259510.54. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\n- However, in the recorded fields:  \n  - recorded_date: **2024-02-08** (should be 2024-01-19)  \n  - recorded_amount: **307810.84** (should be 273168.99)  \n  - recorded_unit_price: **279864.6** (should be 273168.99)  \n  - recorded_tax_amount: **242614.72** (should be 13658.45)  \n  (Other fields not shown, or not relevant.)\n\n- All other fields either match or are uncheckable from the invoice.\n\n- Output is normalized in the requested format, with missing fields as nulls, only inconsistencies documented with reliable best-guess value from invoice description.\n",
