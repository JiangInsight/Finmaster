Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nFormula:  \nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nValues:  \nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,028,375.55  \nTotal Current Liabilities = 378,850.51\n\nCalculation:  \n-1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 = **-2.71**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\nFormula:  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n\nValues:  \nTotal Liabilities = Total Assets - Total Owner's Equity  \n= 14,214,117.02 - 13,835,266.51 = 378,850.51  \nOR from sheet: Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51 (and no long term liabilities listed)\n\nTotal Owner's Equity = 13,835,266.51\n\nCalculation:  \n378,850.51 / 13,835,266.51 ≈ **0.03**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nFormula:  \nTotal Asset Turnover = Total Revenue / Average Total Assets\n\nAverage Total Assets = (Initial + End) / 2 = (13,000,000 + 14,214,117.02) / 2 = 13,607,058.51\n\nTotal Revenue = 2,637,011.03\n\nCalculation:  \n2,637,011.03 / 13,607,058.51 ≈ **0.19**\n\n---\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\nFormula:  \nQuick Ratio = (Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities\n\nNumerator: 2,602,624.45 + 4,283,110.81 + 2,117,339.65 + 15,023.59 = 9,018,098.50  \nDenominator: 378,850.51\n\nCalculation:  \n9,018,098.50 / 378,850.51 ≈ **23.82**\n\n#### Corrrecting with \"Total Current Assets\", which already sums those:  \nQuick Assets = Total Current Assets - Inventory = 9,221,098.50 - 203,000 = 9,018,098.50\n\n**So, Quick Ratio = 9,018,098.50 / 378,850.51 = 23.82**  \nBut the sum above matches, so the value is accurate.\n\n**However, as per standard template (\"Quick Ratio\" = (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities):**\n9,221,098.50 - 203,000 = 9,018,098.50  \n9,018,098.50 / 378,850.51 = **23.82**\n\n*There may be a typo in the sample solution's pattern where a much smaller value is shown. If we restrict \"quick assets\" to cash+bank+accounts receivable+interest receivable only — matches our calculation.*\n\n---\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nSame as Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio:  \n**-2.71**\n\n---\n\n### 6. ROE (Return on Equity)\nFormula:  \nROE = Net Profit / Average Owner's Equity\n\nAverage Owner's Equity = (Initial + End) / 2  \n= (13,000,000 + 13,835,266.51) / 2  \n= 13,417,633.26\n\nNet Profit = 835,266.51\n\nROE = 835,266.51 / 13,417,633.26 = 0.06228 = **6.23%**\n\n*But let's check the sample pattern: \"solution\": {'ROE': '-13.51%'} where -1,645,141.43 / ((13,000,000 + 11,354,858.57)/2) × 100%. So matches above, so our value:*\n\n**ROE = 835,266.51 / 13,417,633.26 × 100% = 6.23%**\n\n---\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nFormula:  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover = Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nSince Accounts Receivable starts at 0 and ends at 2,117,339.65:  \nAverage = (0 + 2,117,339.65)/2 = 1,058,669.83\n\nSales = 2,637,011.03\n\n2,637,011.03 / 1,058,669.83 = **2.49**\n\n---\n\n### Final Check Against Previous Example\n\nIn the pattern, everything is rounded to 2 decimals, Accounts Receivable Turnover has more. Let's use 2 decimals for all answers.\n\n### Final (rounded to 2 decimals):\n\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: -2.71\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.03\n- Total Asset Turnover Ratio: 0.19\n- Quick Ratio: 23.82\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -2.71\n- ROE: 6.23%\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: 2.49\n\n**Corrected solution:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-2.71\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n  \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.19\",\n  \"Quick Ratio\": \"23.82\",\n  \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-2.71\",\n  \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"6.23%\",\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.49\"\n}}\n```",
