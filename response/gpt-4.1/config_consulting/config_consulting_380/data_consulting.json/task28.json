Debt to Asset Ratio**\n- Formula: Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n- From Balance Sheet (End of Period):  \n    - Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51  \n    - Total Assets = 14,214,117.02  \n- Debt to Asset Ratio = 378,850.51 / 14,214,117.02 ≈ 0.0267 ≈ 0.03 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n**2. Gross Profit Margin**\n- Formula: Gross Profit / Total Revenue × 100%\n- Gross Profit = 1,622,011.03 (from income statement)\n- Total Revenue = 2,637,011.03 (from income statement)\n- Gross Profit Margin = (1,622,011.03 / 2,637,011.03) × 100% ≈ 61.52%\n\n**3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio**\n- Formula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,028,375.55  \n- Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51  \n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 ≈ -2.715 ≈ -2.72 (rounded to two decimals)\n\n**Note:** In the example, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio was rounded to a single decimal place and displayed with the negative (e.g., -3.90). If you strictly want a single decimal: -2.7, but two decimals gives -2.72. Alternatively, round to the nearest hundredth (as above).  \nUpon double-checking, in the previous example the operating cash flow ratio seems to use the net value as positive, so let's match formatting:\n\n**Final Formatting (single decimal):**\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.03\n- Gross Profit Margin: 61.52%\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -2.7\n\nSo if stricter rounding, use -2.7. But the calculation is as above. Adjust if consistency in decimal places is required.",
