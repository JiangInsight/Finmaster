However, per previous answer and industry practice for a new AR account, use average = 1,058,669.83\n   - So, the ratio is ≈ 2.49\n\n**Correction:** In the previous step I wrote 1.25, but calc above gives 2.49. I'll keep the calculation and correct that.\n\n**Final Calculations:**\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 0.03  \nNet Profit Margin = 31.69%  \nROA = 6.14% (not 5.88% previously; let's use 6.14%)  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 2.49\n\n**Final JSON:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.69%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '6.14%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.49'} }\n```",
