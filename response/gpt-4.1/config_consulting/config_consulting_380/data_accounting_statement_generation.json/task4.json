Accounts Receivable Initial Value\n\nIn the initial data (rows with \"Initial...\" type), there is **no line indicating an opening balance for Accounts Receivable**, only Cash, Bank deposit, and Fixed Assets.  \n**Therefore:**\n\n> Accounts Receivable Initial Value = 0.00\n\n---\n\n## 2. Which transactions affect Accounts Receivable?\n\n- **Sales:** If \"Sale\" and \"payment/receipt_status\" includes \"Unpaid\" and/or \"receive_method\"/\"payment_method\" includes \"Account Receivable\", then it increases AR.\n- **Collections (receipts) from customers:** If a sale is marked as \"Paid\" or as receipts come in, that amount reduces AR.\n- Here, each \"Sale\" lists full sale amount; the \"Unpaid\"/\"Paid\" and \"Cash\"/\"Account Receivable\" status determines whether it affected AR. In this dataset, the entire \"amount\" is considered the AR increase UNLESS payment is (fully) received immediately (then, AR does not increase for already paid portion).\n\nWe need to **sum all sales where status is \"Unpaid\"** or where \"receive_method\" is \"Account Receivable\" (that is: the AR increases by the **amount** in those lines), and **ignore \"Paid\" ones (since they're not creating AR, since cash was received immediately).**\n\nThis dataset does **not** include any explicit receipts from customers reducing AR, or sales marked as \"Paid and partially unpaid\" (i.e., partially collected and partially on AR, unless possibly the \"Unpaid\" sales with 100,000 paid? Let's clarify).\n\n#### Review of a few lines:\n\nExample:\n| Sale20240112018 | Sale | ... | amount | 293182.36 | ... | Unpaid | 100000.0 | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n\nHere, amount is 293182.36, \"Unpaid\" status, \"Account Receviable\", and \"100000.0\" in \"payment_method\" -- this likely means there's a partial receipt (i.e., 100,000 received, rest on AR)? Let's check the source logic.\n\n**BUT, in the example, for similar rows with partial paid (e.g. tax, after_tax, etc.) they sum the full \"amount\" as AR.**\n\nBut in our data, nothing seems to explicitly reduce AR, so let's **be consistent with the sample.** Let's assume all \"Sale\" rows with \"Unpaid\" status are to be included **in full** as AR (i.e., regardless of whether part is received as cash up front).\n\nSimilarly, **do not count \"Paid\" sales.**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Sum Up All \"Unpaid\" Sales\n\n**Filter: All \"Sale\" rows where payment/receipt_status is \"Unpaid\" (regardless of receive_method) are counted toward AR.**\n\nLet's locate all \"Sale\" rows with this status and sum the \"amount\" column.\n\n### Detailed Step\n\n#### Go through all Sale rows, and for each:\n- if \"payment/receipt_status\" == \"Unpaid\"  \n   â†’ add \"amount\" to the sum.\n\n#### List and sum each \"Unpaid\" Sale row (with their amounts):\n\nLet's systematically list each:\n\n#### January\n\n- Sale20240103005 | Unpaid | 11367.21\n- Sale20240104007 | Unpaid | 12470.63\n- Sale20240104008 | Unpaid | 10372.82\n- Sale20240104009 | Unpaid | 2183.69\n- Sale20240108013 | Unpaid | 54355.58\n- Sale20240111017 | Unpaid | 58578.75\n- Sale20240112018 | Unpaid | 293182.36\n- Sale20240112019 | Unpaid | 58814.47\n- Sale20240113021 | Unpaid | 10735.69\n- Sale20240113022 | Unpaid | 55716.09\n- Sale20240113023 | Unpaid | 14087.68\n- Sale20240114024 | Unpaid | 14850.89\n- Sale20240114025 | Unpaid | 47339.29\n- Sale20240115027 | Unpaid | 270292.77\n- Sale20240117030 | Unpaid | 280131.74\n- Sale20240117031 | Unpaid | 10866.84\n- Sale20240117032 | Unpaid | 12808.07\n- Sale20240118033 | Unpaid | 1843.66\n- Sale20240118034 | Unpaid | 2197.86\n- Sale20240119036 | Unpaid | 193401.6\n- Sale20240122040 | Unpaid | 42265.05\n- Sale20240124044 | Unpaid | 298580.2\n- Sale20240124045 | Unpaid | 2172.51\n- Sale20240126050 | Unpaid | 58733.47\n- Sale20240126052 | Unpaid | 2069.59\n- Sale20240127055 | Unpaid | 2127.4\n- Sale20240131060 | Unpaid | 47420.6\n\n#### February\n\n- Sale20240203068 | Unpaid | 225665.95\n- Sale20240203069 | Unpaid | 1917.12\n- Sale20240205072 | Unpaid | 9646.63\n- Sale20240205073 | Unpaid | 11143.44\n\n---\n\n### Now, sum these values:\n\nLet me sum step by step.\n\n#### January\n\n11367.21  \n+ 12470.63 = 23837.84  \n+ 10372.82 = 34210.66  \n+ 2183.69 = 36394.35  \n+ 54355.58 = 90749.93  \n+ 58578.75 = 149328.68  \n+ 293182.36 = 442511.04  \n+ 58814.47 = 501325.51  \n+ 10735.69 = 512061.20  \n+ 55716.09 = 567777.29  \n+ 14087.68 = 581864.97  \n+ 14850.89 = 596715.86  \n+ 47339.29 = 644055.15  \n+ 270292.77 = 914347.92  \n+ 280131.74 = 1194479.66  \n+ 10866.84 = 1205346.50  \n+ 12808.07 = 1218154.57  \n+ 1843.66 = 1219998.23  \n+ 2197.86 = 1222196.09  \n+ 193401.6 = 1415597.69  \n+ 42265.05 = 1457862.74  \n+ 298580.2 = 1756442.94  \n+ 2172.51 = 1758615.45  \n+ 58733.47 = 1817348.92  \n+ 2069.59 = 1819418.51  \n+ 2127.4 = 1821545.91  \n+ 47420.6 = 1868966.51  \n\n#### February\n\n+ 225665.95 = 2094632.46  \n+ 1917.12 = 2096549.58  \n+ 9646.63 = 2106196.21  \n+ 11143.44 = 2117339.65\n\n---\n\n**Total = 2,117,339.65**\n\n---\n\n## 4.
