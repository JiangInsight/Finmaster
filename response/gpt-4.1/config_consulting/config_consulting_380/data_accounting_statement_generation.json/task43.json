                        "content": "Let's break down the calculation step by step.\n\n### 1. **Identify Cash Flows Related to Operating Activities**\n\n#### **Cash Inflows (Receipts):**\n- **Cash sales received:** \"Sale\" transactions where \"payment/receipt_status\" is \"Paid\".\n  - Consider only the received portion (\"Paid\") as cash inflow.\n- **Other cash receipts:** \n  - For this data, other income such as \"Interest Receivables\" are \"Unpaid\" (not a cash flow yet), so no cash flow.\n\n#### **Cash Outflows (Payments):**\n- **Operating expenses paid in cash:** \"Sales Expenses\", \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Financial Expenses\" where \"Paid\".\n- **Purchases paid in cash/bank transfer:** \"Purchase\" records where \"Paid\", and \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" (but only include operating, not investing).\n  - **Note:** Fixed Assets purchases are in investing activities, NOT operating. *Exclude them!*\n- **Do NOT include 'Depreciation'**: Non-cash adjustment.\n\n#### **Summary:**\n- **Include:** Cash receipts from customers (portion actually received), cash operating expenses paid, cash purchases of inventory/services (for operations).\n- **Exclude:** Unpaid items, depreciation, purchases of long-term assets (investing activity).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Extract and Sum the Relevant Amounts**\n\n#### **A. Cash Received from Customers**\n\nFor each **\"Sale\"** line with \"Paid\" status:\n- The \"amount\" column shows the sale amount, \"Paid\" status gives \"unit_price\" as amount received.\n  - But in this dataset, for \"Paid\" status, the \"amount\" is total sale, but \"unit_price\" is the cash received (which should match paid?):\n    - Example: Sale20240102003: amount=13728.16, payment/receipt_status=Paid, unit_price=5000.00.\n    - **However, in the sample, we see for paid: the amount is full, but the \"cash\" portion is the amount paid.**\n    - Let's check further: Sometimes the payment status is \"Paid\", but unit_price is less than amount. Looks like unit_price shows cash paid.\n    - Let's summarize:\n      - For \"Paid\" sales: cash inflow = \"unit_price\".\n      - For \"Unpaid\" sales: ignore for oper cash flow.\n    - If \"unit_price\" is blank, then likely \"amount\" is cash amount.\n\nLet's go through each line and sum up the inflows:\n\n##### **List of \"Sale\" with Paid:**\nLet's select all \"Sale\" with \"Paid\" and read the \"unit_price\" as the actually received cash:\n\n- Sale20240102003: 5000.00\n- Sale20240115028: 20000.00\n- Sale20240124043: 20000.00\n- Sale20240125048: 20000.00\n- Sale20240126051: 20000.00\n- Sale20240127056: 1000.00\n- Sale20240131059: 1000.00\n- Sale20240201062: 5000.00\n- Sale20240201063: 1000.00\n\nBut there are more, let's list all \"Sale\" lines where \"Paid\" status, and sum their \"unit_price\".\n\nLet's search for more (searching for \"Sale\" lines with \"Paid\" and get their unit_price):\n\n- Sale20240102003 (cash): 5000.00\n- Sale20240115028 (cash): 20000.00\n- Sale20240124043 (cash): 20000.00\n- Sale20240125048 (cash): 20000.00\n- Sale20240126051 (cash): 20000.00\n- Sale20240127056 (cash): 1000.00\n- Sale20240131059 (cash): 1000.00\n- Sale20240201062 (cash): 5000.00\n- Sale20240201063 (cash): 1000.00\n- Sale20240202065 (cash): 5000.00\n\nIs that all? Let's go back to start and check for any other \"Sale\" with \"Paid\":\n\n- Sale20240126051: 20000.00\n- Sale20240127056: 1000.00\n- Sale20240131059: 1000.00\n- Sale20240201062: 5000.00\n- Sale20240201063: 1000.00\n- Sale20240202065: 5000.00\n\nFrom earlier in the month:\n- Sale20240102003: 5000.00\n- Sale20240115028: 20000.00\n- Sale20240124043: 20000.00\n- Sale20240125048: 20000.00\n\nAre there more?\nFor earlier dates (before 2024-01-10):\n\n- Sale20240102003: 5000.00\n(checking if there are more on 2024-01-15, 2024-01-16...)\n\nLet's do a full scan for each line with \"Sale\" and \"Paid\":\n\n(Counting from above)\n\n#### **List so far:**\nSale Records | unit_price\n- Sale20240102003 | 5000.00\n- Sale20240115028 | 20000.00\n- Sale20240124043 | 20000.00\n- Sale20240125048 | 20000.00\n- Sale20240126051 | 20000.00\n- Sale20240127056 | 1000.00\n- Sale20240131059 | 1000.00\n- Sale20240201062 | 5000.00\n- Sale20240201063 | 1000.00\n- Sale20240202065 | 5000.00\n\nAll other sales are \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Receivable\".\n\nSo, let's sum these amounts:\n= 5000 + 20000 + 20000 + 20000 + 20000 + 1000 + 1000 + 5000 + 1000 + 5000\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n- Step 1: 5000 + (20000 x 4) = 5000 + 80000 = 85000\n- Plus 1000 + 1000 = 2000 → 85000 + 2000 = 87000\n- Plus 5000 + 1000 + 5000 = 11000 → 87000 + 11000 = 98000\n\n**Total cash inflows from customers:** **98,000.00**\n\n---\n\n#### **B.
