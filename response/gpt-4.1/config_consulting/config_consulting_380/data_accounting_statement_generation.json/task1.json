                        "content": "Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n## Step 1: Find Cash on Hand Initial Value\n\n- From the transactions, the initial value of \"Cash deposit\" is **3,000,000.00**.  \n- All other initial assets are not cash on hand.\n\nSo,  \n**Cash on Hand Initial Value = 3,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Compute Changes to Cash on Hand\n\n- \"Cash on hand\" increases ONLY from sales received in cash, and decreases from payments/expenses made in cash and purchases marked as \"Paid\" with \"Cash\".\n- Ignore unpaid, paid via Bank transfer, and any other non-cash movement.\n- No \"cash to bank transfer\" lines present.\n\n### **Cash Inflows (INCREASES):**\n\nFind all \"Sale\" transactions with paid amount in cash.\n\nFrom table structure/distinction, we must check:\n- Type is \"Sale\"\n- If sale is marked \"Paid\", the paid amount in cash is shown in the \"paid\" field.\n\nLet's extract each sale with cash inflow and sum \"paid\" for each, only if actually paid.  \n(The \"paid\" field is the amount received in cash in each \"Sale\" with \"Paid\". Unpaid: skip.)\n\nGo through all \"Sale\" entries (look for lines where \"Sale\" and \"Paid\" and \"Cash\" is mentioned, or \"paid\" field present):\n\n1. 2024-01-02 | Sale | 13728.16 | Paid | 5000.0\n2. 2024-01-15 | Sale | 42229.1  | Paid | 20000.0\n3. 2024-01-24 | Sale | 58469.49 | Paid | 20000.0\n4. 2024-01-25 | Sale | 43620.47 | Paid | 20000.0\n5. 2024-01-26 | Sale | 53259.97 | Paid | 20000.0\n6. 2024-01-27 | Sale | 2726.04  | Paid | 1000.0\n7. 2024-01-31 | Sale | 2964.2   | Paid | 1000.0\n8. 2024-02-01 | Sale | 13107.04 | Paid | 5000.0\n9. 2024-02-01 | Sale | 1815.22  | Paid | 1000.0\n10.2024-02-02 | Sale | 14582.7  | Paid | 5000.0\n\nSum up the \"paid\" values from above:\n\n- 5000.0\n- 20000.0\n- 20000.0\n- 20000.0\n- 20000.0\n- 1000.0\n- 1000.0\n- 5000.0\n- 1000.0\n- 5000.0\n\nTotal cash inflow =  \n5,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 + 1,000 + 1,000 + 5,000 + 1,000 + 5,000 = **98,000.00**\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Compute Cash Outflows\n\nPayments that REDUCE cash on hand:\n- **Any \"Expense\" or \"Purchase\" with \"Paid\" and \"Cash\" as the method.**\n\n### (A) EXPENSES (Paid by Cash)\n\nFind all lines:\n- Type: Expense\n- \"Paid\" and \"Cash\" in payment_method\n\nLet's scan, for each \"Expense\" line, does it say \"Paid\" and \"Cash\":\n(Eg: Expense... | ... | Paid | | Cash ...)\nAll such expenses are paid in cash.\n\nAdd up all \"amount\" for these Expense rows.\n\nLet's list each out and sum:\n\n#### Expenses Paid in Cash:\n\n1. 2024-01-01 | Sales Expenses          | 16773.53\n2. 2024-01-01 | Sales Expenses          | 9694.49\n3.
