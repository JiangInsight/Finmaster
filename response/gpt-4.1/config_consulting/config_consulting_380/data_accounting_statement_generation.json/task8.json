It shows the total amount of depreciation expense that has been charged against fixed assets since those assets were acquired.\n\n- **Initial Value:** At the beginning of the period, what is the starting balance of accumulated depreciation?\n- **End Value:** At the end of the period, what is the closing balance after including new depreciation entries?\n\n## Step 2: Identify Relevant Transactions\nWe only care about entries affecting \"Accumulated Depreciation\". This means:\n- Initial balances for this account (there are usually none unless provided).\n- Any \"Depreciation\" expense entries in the data (tagged as \"Depreciation\" under the type column).\n\n### Look for Initial Value\n- There are multiple \"Initial\" entries (e.g., cash, bank, fixed assets), but **there is no line showing an opening balance for accumulated depreciation**.\n- Therefore, the initial accumulated depreciation balance is **zero**.\n\n### Look for Movement (Depreciation Entries)\n- 2024-01-01: `Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 45753.240000000005`\n- 2024-02-01: `Depreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | 2024-02-01 | 47117.43`\n\n#### We'll assume for monthly closing balance, \"End Value\" includes all depreciation up to the last provided date (which is after 2024-02-01), i.e. sum all depreciation entries up to and including the most recent one.\n\n#### Accumulated Depreciation Calculation\n- **Initial Accumulated Depreciation**: 0.00 (since not specified otherwise)\n- **Depreciation Added:**\n    - 2024-01-01: 45753.24\n    - 2024-02-01: 47117.43\n- **Total at End**: 0.00 + 45753.24 + 47117.43 = 92870.67\n\n## Step 3: Present in Required Format\nAll amounts rounded or presented as shown in entries.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accumulated Depreciation End Value': '92870.67'} }\n```\n",
