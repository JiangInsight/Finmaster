                        "content": "Let's solve step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all \"Purchase\" transactions and payment status.**\n\nWe want to compute the change (increase/decrease) in Accounts Payable over the period. This is shown on the cash flow statement (indirect method) as the difference in accounts payable at end vs. beginning, caused by purchases on credit (unpaid) minus cash payments of payables recorded previously.\n\nHere, since all transactions are contained within this period and no prior period balances given, we treat the start as zero.\n\nSo, for this period:  \n**Increase in Accounts Payable = All purchases marked \"Unpaid\" by end of period (\"Account Payable\" as payment method, \"Unpaid\" as status).**\n\n**Step 2: List all Purchases marked \"Unpaid\" (\"Account Payable\")**\n\nFrom the data:\n\n| id          | amount   | payment_status | payment_method   |\n|-------------|----------|---------------|------------------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | 10000.0  | Unpaid        | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231002 | 10000.0  | Unpaid        | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231003 | 1000.0   | Unpaid        | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231004 | 40000.0  | Unpaid        | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231005 | 5000.0   | Unpaid        | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231007 | 15000.0  | Unpaid        | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231013 | 2000.0   | Unpaid        | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231014 | 20000.0  | Unpaid        | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231015 | 20000.0  | Unpaid        | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231017 | 2000.0   | Unpaid        | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231020 | 1000.0   | Unpaid        | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231021 | 1000.0   | Unpaid        | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231024 | 20000.0  | Unpaid        | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231026 | 100000.0 | Unpaid        | Account Payable  |\n\nSum all these:\n\n10000.0  \n+ 10000.0  \n+ 1000.0  \n+ 40000.0  \n+ 5000.0  \n+ 15000.0  \n+ 2000.0  \n+ 20000.0  \n+ 20000.0  \n+ 2000.0  \n+ 1000.0  \n+ 1000.0  \n+ 20000.0  \n+ 100000.0  \n= **210,000 + 100,000 = 310,000.0**\n\nSum (double check, adding stepwise):\n\n10000 + 10000 = 20000  \n+ 1000 = 21000  \n+ 40000 = 61000  \n+ 5000 = 66000  \n+ 15000 = 81000  \n+ 2000 = 83000  \n+ 20000 = 103000  \n+ 20000 = 123000  \n+ 2000 = 125000  \n+ 1000 = 126000  \n+ 1000 = 127000  \n+ 20000 = 147000  \n+ 100000 = 247000  \n\nWait, the sum here is 247,000. Let's re-list and add again carefully:\n\n1. 10000\n2. 10000 (total 20000)\n3. 1000 (21000)\n4. 40000 (61000)\n5. 5000 (66000)\n6. 15000 (81000)\n7. 2000 (83000)\n8. 20000 (103000)\n9. 20000 (123000)\n10. 2000 (125000)\n11. 1000 (126000)\n12. 1000 (127000)\n13. 20000 (147000)\n14. 100000 (247000)\n\n**Yes, final total is 247,000.0**\n\n**Step 3: Did any of these get paid during the period?**\nLet's check if any of these Unpaid, Account Payable purchases were paid later in this period -- they would then not be accounts payable at year end.\n\nFrom what is visible, only those with payment_status: Paid and payment_method: Bank Transfer or Cash (with same IDs as above) would indicate payment. But for above purchase IDs, their payment_status is still \"Unpaid\" (and in \"Account Payable\") -- so as of the end, ALL these amounts remain accounts payable.\n\n**Step 4: Show Solution**\n\nThe \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" for the cash flow statement (ending balance in the period) is **247,000.00**.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"247000.00\"} }\n```",
