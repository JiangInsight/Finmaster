In the provided transactions, the **Initial** entries (\"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\") are capital investments and together constitute the full initial paid-in capital. Paid-in capital does not change unless there is (1) additional capital injections or (2) withdrawals of capital (not shown as normal business transactions like revenue, expenses, asset purchases, depreciation, etc.).\n\n#### Paid-in capital is NOT affected by:\n- Purchases\n- Expenses\n- Depreciation\n- Sales\n- Interest receivable\n- Internal transfers\n\nIt will ONLY change if there is a new capital injection or a withdrawal/return of capital to shareholders (not seen here).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find All Entries of Paid-in Capital\n\nLook for initial capital investments:\n- **Cash deposit:** 3,000,000.00\n- **Bank deposit:** 5,000,000.00\n- **Fixed Assets:** 5,000,000.00\n\nThus, \nTotal Initial Paid-in Capital = 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = **13,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Check for Capital Changes\n\nScan for any entries indicating new capital injections or withdrawals. All other transactions (sales, purchases, expenses, depreciation, internal transfers) do NOT affect paid-in capital.\n\nThere are **no further capital changes**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Answer\n\n- **Paid-in Capital Initial Value:** 13,000,000.00\n- **Paid-in Capital End Value:** 13,000,000.00\n\n---\n\n### Final Solution\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
