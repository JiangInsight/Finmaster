Only transactions in the period are considered.\n\n- Only the entry with id = FixedAsset20231231001 is a purchase of (new) fixed assets *during the period*.\n\n**Step 2: Find Cashflows related to Investing Activities**\n\nReview for any other investing cash flows:\n- No proceeds from asset sales found.\n- No other asset purchases (only operating \"Purchase\" for consulting/services).\n\nThus,\n- The only *investing activity cash flow* is the outflow for *Office Equipment* purchase of 85,889.19 via bank transfer.\n\n**Step 3: Report the Net Cash Flow**\n\n- Outflow: â€“85,889.19\n\n**Step 4: Provide the Solution in Required Format**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-85889.19\"} }\n```",
