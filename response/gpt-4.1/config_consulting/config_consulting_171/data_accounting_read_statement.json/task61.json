Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers. These are usually under “Selling Expenses” in the Income Statement.\n    2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets. This is usually “Purchase of Fixed Assets” or similar in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\n- Review the provided statements:\n\n**Income Statement**:\n- \"Selling Expenses\" = 274260.07 (this is value1)\n\n**Cash Flow Statement**:\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = 0.00 (this is value2)\n\n**Final values (instructed output)**:\n- value1 = 274260.07\n- value2 = 0.00\n\nThus, the answer is as above.",
