The task asks for the specific line items and value of expense in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, including initial and final values, based on the provided balance sheet.\n\n2. From the balance sheet, the clear expense-related line item that usually appears both in the balance sheet and in profit or loss is \"Accumulated Depreciation.\" This account accumulates the periodic expense for depreciation, which hits profit or loss as a depreciation expense.\n\n3. The initial and end values for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" are:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n   - End_amount: 91505.05 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n4. Thus, the solution should present those values, representing the total depreciation expense recognized during the period.\n\nFinal answer in required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"91505.05\"} }\n```",
