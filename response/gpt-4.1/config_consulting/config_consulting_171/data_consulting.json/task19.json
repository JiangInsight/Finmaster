Current Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nCurrent Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\n**From Balance Sheet (End Amounts):**  \n- Total Current Assets = 10,619,895.35  \n- Total Current Liabilities = 624,988.48  \n\n**Calculation:**  \nCurrent Ratio = 10,619,895.35 / 624,988.48 ≈ 16.99\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = 2,018,000.00 (from income statement)\n- Average Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2\n\n**From Balance Sheet:**  \n- Beginning Inventory (2023-12-31): 0.00  \n- Ending Inventory (2024-02-05): 485,000.00  \n\n**Average Inventory:**  \n(0.00 + 485,000.00) / 2 = 242,500.00\n\n**Calculation:**  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = 2,018,000.00 / 242,500.00 ≈ 8.33\n\nHowever, since the inventory at the start of the period is zero, and all inventory was purchased (as reflected in cash flow), it would make more sense in this particular context to compare it using ending inventory, but the intention based on example is to use average, even if it inflates the ratio.\n\nBut for a period that covers only one month, and a business that started from zero inventory, the turnover ratio will indeed be high or skewed. To be consistent with your example, we use the average:\n\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = 2,018,000 / 242,500 ≈ 8.33\n\nHowever, in the example you provided, the calculation used only the ending inventory as the denominator, so let's double-check the pattern:\n\n**Example pattern check:**\n- Example COGS = 4,410,000\n- Example End Inventory = 5,090,000\n- Example Turnover Ratio reported: 1.73 (which is 4,410,000 / 5,090,000 ≈ 0.87; but 4,410,000 / (5,090,000/2) = 1.73—so they used average = (0+5,090,000)/2=2,545,000; 4,410,000/2,545,000 ≈ 1.73)\n\nTherefore, **the average inventory method is confirmed.**\n\nSo, using average inventory:\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 2,018,000 / 242,500 ≈ 8.33\n\nBut the example's pattern shows the period is about a month, and the business started with zero, so the ratio is high.\n\nHence, **final answers**:\n- Current Ratio: 16.99\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio: 8.33\n\n**But originally I put 4.16, which was with ending inventory, but the example uses the average. The correct final output is:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Current Ratio\": \"16.99\", \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"8.33\"} }\n```",
