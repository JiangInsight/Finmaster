In the example, if beginning AR was 0 and ending AR was 2,429,482.13; with sales of 5,431,018.59, the calculated turnover was 4.47, which matches the formula.\n\nGiven the current problem data:\n\n- Beginning AR = 0  \n- Ending AR = 2,984,071.72  \n- Average AR = (0+2,984,071.72)/2 = 1,492,035.86  \n- Sales = 4,879,769.51  \n- Ratio = 4,879,769.51 / 1,492,035.86 ≈ 3.27\n\nOn a re-check (matching the example method):  \nIn the example, all AR is new within the period, so all business is on credit. The ratio, when beginning AR is 0, is usually Sales / (Ending AR / 2), since almost all AR comes from sales during the period.\n\nThus:\nTurnover = Sales / Average AR = 4,879,769.51 / 1,492,035.86 = 3.27\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 3.27.\n\nLet me re-present the answer with this accurate value:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.27\"} }\n```\n",
