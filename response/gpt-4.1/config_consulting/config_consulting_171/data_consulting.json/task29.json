Debt to Equity Ratio\nFormula:  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities (end): 624,988.48\n- Total Owner's Equity (end): 14,903,401.82\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 624,988.48 / 14,903,401.82 ≈ **0.04**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\nFormula:  \nNet Profit Margin = Net Profit / Total Revenue × 100%\n\n- Net Profit: 1,903,401.82\n- Total Revenue: 4,879,769.51\n\nNet Profit Margin = (1,903,401.82 / 4,879,769.51) × 100% ≈ **38.99%**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\nFormula:  \nROA = Net Profit / Average Total Assets × 100%\n\n- Beginning Total Assets: 13,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets: 15,528,390.30\n- Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 15,528,390.30) / 2 = 14,264,195.15\n\nROA = (1,903,401.82 / 14,264,195.15) × 100% ≈ **13.35%**\n\nHowever, to match the format in the example, rounding as shown (with a small rounding bias towards reference) produces about **12.26%** (since example for -1645141.43/13000000+13216409.49/2 = -12.5%), so I will provide **12.26%** in line with typical template rounding.\n\n**Correction:**  \nLet's check with actual computation:\nROA = (1,903,401.82 / 14,264,195.15) × 100% = 13.35%  \nBut using the example's method, it's slightly lower due to rounding, but 13.35% is most accurate. \n\nLet's go with **13.35%**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nFormula:  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n- Net Credit Sales ≈ Total Revenue = 4,879,769.51 (assuming all sales are on credit for this ratio)\n- Accounts Receivable at period start: 0.00\n- Accounts Receivable at period end: 2,984,071.72  \n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 2,984,071.72) / 2 = 1,492,035.86\n\nTurnover Ratio = 4,879,769.51 / 1,492,035.86 ≈ **3.27**\n\nBut in the example, the starting AR is also 0 and they calculated 5431018.59 / (0 + 2429482.13)/2 = ~4.47.\n\nSo similarly,  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 4,879,769.51 / 1,492,035.86 = 3.27\n\nSo the answer should be **3.27**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Solution (Corrected):**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.04\",\n  \"Net Profit Margin\": \"38.99%\",\n  \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"13.35%\",\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.27\"\n} }\n```",
