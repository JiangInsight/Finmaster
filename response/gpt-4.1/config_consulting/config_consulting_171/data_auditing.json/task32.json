The most reliable is the \"invoice\" which lists bank deposit and fixed assets at 5,000,000 each, so the amount for both should be 5,000,000. The \"Cash deposit\" for this ID should not be 3,000,000 since it's inconsistent with the others and duplicate IDs for initial capitalization should match totals.**\n\n**2. \"Sale20240107011\" — This row shows a sale with quantity 0.0, unit price 172855.57, amount 212644.39, but the invoice states \"1.0 unit at 192,028.00, total 192,028.00\". Cost, tax, profit all match (100,000, 9601.40, 92028.00), so the correct should be: quantity 1.0, unit price 192,028.00, amount 192,028.00, and the recorded fields being quantity 0, unit price 172,855.57, amount 212,644.39 are wrong. Date also does not match: recorded 2024-01-25, but invoice states Jan 7, 2024.**\n\nIf you need further breakdowns for more IDs, let me know!",
