Typically, initial capital injection is not split this way or, if split, IDs will differ. Either a) amounts are not reconciling or b) multiple records with same ID for different types. Strong likelihood of double-counting or mis-categorization.\n2. **Interest20240102002 (and similar)**: In the examples, there could be typos in \"receviable/receivable\". Here, both 'Original' and 'Recorded' show \"Interest receviable\", so no issue (but in the sample in your prompt, a minor typo triggers a flag in the \"risk_issues\" column).\n3. **Sale20240112024**: The invoice says \"account receviable\" but \"recorded_receive_method\" is \"Cash\" (should match the invoice; indicates an internal error). Also, \"payment/receipt_status\" is \"Paid\" when invoice and logic both show it is unpaid (\"Account Receivable\" means payment has not been received).\n\nNo other entries display a clear mismatch between invoice description and recorded columns (when compared line-by-line). Some field names (e.g. \"Senior Staff\" vs \"Senior Supervisor\", \"Junior Staff\" vs \"Junior Staff\") may differ slightly, but these should be reconciled if a given company distinguishes between the titles; the entries as present are internally consistent otherwise. \n\n**If you want all typo-level issues (\"Staff\" vs \"Supervisor\", etc.) flagged, or more granular checks per field, mention so and I can enumerate them exhaustively.**",
