The database row, however, has mismatched values as follows:\n    - category is Sales Expenses instead of Sale,\n    - date is 2024-01-23 instead of 2024-01-07,\n    - price is $44,290.82 recorded instead of $43,597.09,\n    - amount is $47,234.17 recorded instead of $43,597.09,\n    - tax is $36,562.56 recorded instead of $2,179.85,\n    - profit field is left blank,\n    - receive_method is blank instead of \"Cash\".\n- The solution field reconstructs the mapping from the invoice vs the erroneously recorded row.",
