The entries for `Initial20231231001` conflictâ€”the same ID is used for a Cash deposit ($3,000,000), Bank deposit ($5,000,000), and Fixed Assets ($5,000,000), all on the same date. Standard accounting would have three different initial entry IDs. The invoice, which is considered reliable, says $5,000,000 for both Bank deposit and Fixed Assets, but $3,000,000 for Cash deposit, so Cash deposit's `recorded_category` and `recorded_amount` should match invoice Bank deposit ($5m), but since it is a distinct line in the source, both are possible; therefore, this is a data entry or merge conflict, and both the \"category\" and \"amount\" vary across lines for the same ID.\n   \n2. For `Sale20240102001`, the `recorded_receive_method` is empty, but the invoice clearly says \"account receivable\". Thus, the correct value should be \"Account Receviable\".\n\n3. For `Expense20240125001` and `Expense20240130001`, the recorded preparer is empty (`null`), but the invoice says 'Staff' or 'Junior Staff' as the original preparer. This is a missing value error for both.\n\n4. No error for the sample purchase lines, as the amounts, quantities, unit prices, supplier IDs, and payment methods all match what the reliable invoice text states.\n\nThus, above are the internal inconsistencies based on the logic of reconciling reliable invoice text with the structured fields. No recorded/actual date discrepancies were found, nor were there payment/receipt status mismatches in the sample provided (they all match invoice). Where ambiguous (e.g., the initial entry), list both fields as mismatched for clarity.",
