(Optional for completeness, but the pattern is established.)\n\n]}\n```\n\n#### Reasoning Steps:\n- For many Sale transactions, the \"recorded_payment_method\" field is wrongly filled with the \"cost per unit\" value, not the payment method or is irrelevant for sales.\n- The \"receive_method\" field is often left blank in the record but is clearly stated in the invoice (Cash or Account Receivable).\n- The \"payment/receipt_status\" field is often blank but the invoice describes if it was Paid or Unpaid.\n- For certain expense transactions, if the category or date doesn't match, or if the Preparer/Approver doesn't match the invoice, this is flagged.\n- Quantities and unit prices rarely have mismatches because they're standardized by the invoice.\n- Where necessary, the corrected values are inferred from the invoice column, as it's considered more reliable.\n\n**If you want only the first specific example as in the template, use just Sale20240102001 above.
