The payment_method... bank transfer, ... paid... The supplier ID is S003, name Supplier 3.\"\n- The table's actual row contradicts this information:\n  - recorded_type (category) is \"Sales Expenses\", not \"Purchase\"\n  - recorded_date is \"2024-01-20\", not \"2023-12-31\"\n  - recorded_quantity is 2, not 3\n  - recorded_unit_price is 94534.3, not 100000.00\n  - recorded_amount is 341761.9, not 300000.00\n\nAll other transactions in the block closely match their invoices and show no obvious internal mismatch or contradiction. Thus, only Purchase20231231008 has clear, concrete internal inconsistencies based on the standardized invoice content.\n\nIf you want a full list for other examples, please specify, but for this specific dataset and your question, this is the only applicable answer.",
