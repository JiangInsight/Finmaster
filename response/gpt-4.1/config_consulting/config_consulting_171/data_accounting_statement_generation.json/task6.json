Cash / Bank:**\n- All \"Paid\" expenses, purchases, and \"Cash\" sales (reduce cash)\n- Bank Transfer purchases and payments (reduce cash/bank)\n- \"Cash\" collection from customer increases cash\n\n**B. Account Receivable**\n- \"Unpaid\" sales (increase receivables)\n- If \"Paid\", money is in cash/bank, not accounts rec.\n\n**C. Interest Receivable**\n- Each \"Interest Receivable\" transaction (unpaid, increases)\n- Interest isn't shown as \"paid\" anywhere\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Step-by-Step Calculation of Ending Balances**\n\n#### **a.

Did I miss any? Let's quickly add up all sales with \"Paid\" as the payment/receipt_status.\n\nFrom original table, many sales are \"Unpaid\" but I've included all Paid sales above.\n\nLet’s sum these PAID sales values:\nLet's sum stepwise:\n\n47,593.55  \n+47,555.26 = 95,148.81  \n+43,597.09 = 138,745.90  \n+280,252.81 = 418,998.71  \n+53,074.78 = 472,073.49  \n+293,772.48 = 765,845.97  \n+9,086.17 = 774,932.14  \n+2,334.27 = 777,266.41  \n+44,910.8 = 822,177.21  \n+2,239.83 = 824,417.04  \n+9,522.79 = 833,939.83  \n+236,405.08 = 1,070,344.91  \n+14,272.77 = 1,084,617.68  \n+39,826.86 = 1,124,444.54  \n+298,084.8 = 1,422,529.34  \n+246,512.71 = 1,669,042.05  \n+226,655.74 = 1,895,697.79\n\n**Total paid sales: 1,895,697.79**\n\n---\n\n#### **b. Accounts Receivable**\n\nStart at 0, since nothing is in accounts receivable at initial balance.\n\n- Each new \"Unpaid\" sale increases receivables\n- Each \"Unpaid\" purchase does NOT impact receivable (the company owes, not is owed)\n- No collection transactions are shown (i.e., after sales, \"paid\" sales do not decrease AR; only sales with \"Unpaid\" status appear as AR at period end)\n\nSo, **Total Accounts Receivable = Sum of all \"Sale\" rows where payment/receipt_status is \"Unpaid\" (field is \"Unpaid\")**\n\nLet us find and sum all those.\n\nGo through Sale rows:\n\nSummary table for \"Unpaid\" Sales:\n\n| id | amount |\n|----|--------|\nSale20240102001 | 53170.71\nSale20240105005 | 2943.51\nSale20240106009 | 262445.58\nSale20240107011 | 192028.0\nSale20240107012 | 52961.46\nSale20240108016 | 2925.01\nSale20240109020 | 10545.58\nSale20240112024 | 242599.54\nSale20240112026 | 243590.56\nSale20240114030 | 190478.23\nSale20240114031 | 48342.01\nSale20240117036 | 2667.21\nSale20240117037 | 10762.61\nSale20240117038 | 2942.21\nSale20240118041 | 250090.56\nSale20240120044 | 58141.88\nSale20240120045 | 1915.39\nSale20240121047 | 53934.4\nSale20240121048 | 181654.5\nSale20240121049 | 12736.6\nSale20240122050 | 11667.43\nSale20240122051 | 52739.99\nSale20240123053 | 196484.2\nSale20240125056 | 11498.77\nSale20240125057 | 53628.0\nSale20240125058 | 218410.49\nSale20240127060 | 2220.88\nSale20240127061 | 46461.67\nSale20240130064 | 13371.18\nSale20240130065 | 58898.91\nSale20240201072 | 14642.94\nSale20240202074 | 44442.71\nSale20240205076 | 292202.87\nSale20240205077 | 37363.94\n\nNow, add these:\n\n53,170.71  \n+2,943.51 = 56,114.22  \n+262,445.58 = 318,559.80  \n+192,028.00 = 510,587.80  \n+52,961.46 = 563,549.26  \n+2,925.01 = 566,474.27  \n+10,545.58 = 577,019.85  \n+242,599.54 = 819,619.39  \n+243,590.56 = 1,063,209.95  \n+190,478.23 = 1,253,688.18  \n+48,342.01 = 1,302,030.19  \n+2,667.21 = 1,304,697.40  \n+10,762.61 = 1,315,460.01  \n+2,942.21 = 1,318,402.22  \n+250,090.56 = 1,568,492.78  \n+58,141.88 = 1,626,634.66  \n+1,915.39 = 1,628,550.05  \n+53,934.40 = 1,682,484.45  \n+181,654.50 = 1,864,138.95  \n+12,736.60 = 1,876,875.55  \n+11,667.43 = 1,888,542.98  \n+52,739.99 = 1,941,282.97  \n+196,484.20 = 2,137,767.17  \n+11,498.77 = 2,149,265.94  \n+53,628.00 = 2,202,893.94  \n+218,410.49 = 2,421,304.43  \n+2,220.88 = 2,423,525.31  \n+46,461.67 = 2,469,986.98  \n+13,371.18 = 2,483,358.16  \n+58,898.91 = 2,542,257.07  \n+14,642.94 = 2,556,900.01  \n+44,442.71 = 2,601,342.72  \n+292,202.87 = 2,893,545.59  \n+37,363.94 = 2,930,909.53\n\n**Accounts Receivable = 2,930,909.53**\n\n---\n\n#### **c.
