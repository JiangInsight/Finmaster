In your case, all purchase rows are for consulting, solutions, etc.â€”these are **NOT capital assets** but operating expenses/services.\n\nThere is **NO other row** indicating an addition to non-current assets (i.e., no property/plant/equipment/furniture/computer listed, just purchases of services/products).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Depreciation\n\nThe recognized depreciation should be SUBTRACTED from non-current assets.\n\n**Depreciation entries:**\n- Depreciation20240101001: 45,754.64\n- Depreciation20240201002: 45,750.41\n\nSum:  \n= 45,754.64 + 45,750.41  \n= 91,505.05\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Asset Disposals\n\nReview for any disposals of fixed assets. No such record is in the data.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Compute Final Non-current Assets Value\n\n**Final Value = Initial Value + Additions - Depreciation**\n\n- Initial Value: 5,000,000.00\n- Additions: 0.00\n- Depreciation: 91,505.05\n\n**Final Value = 5,000,000.00 - 91,505.05 = 4,908,494.95**\n\n---\n\n## Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"4908494.95\"} }\n```\n**Explanation:**\n- Initial value from \"Fixed Assets\" = 5,000,000.00\n- No capital asset purchases.\n- Deduct depreciation posted in January and February = 91,505.05\n- No disposals.\n\n**Non-current asset (property, plant & equipment) end value: 4,908,494.95**",
