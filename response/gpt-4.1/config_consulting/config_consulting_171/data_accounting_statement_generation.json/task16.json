                        "content": "Let's solve the \"Paid-in Capital\" calculation step by step:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Identify What Constitutes Paid-in Capital**\n\n**Paid-in Capital** (or Contributed Capital) is the capital that shareholders have invested in the company.  \nOn balance sheets, this typically comes from owner/shareholder cash or in-kind contributions made at the company’s founding or at subsequent share issues.  \nIt is NOT affected by normal revenues, expenses, purchases, or operating activities.\n\n**Paid-in Capital entries are generally identifiable as:**\n- \"Initial\" entries with types like \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\" (if invested by shareholders at start).\n- Sometimes, very explicit capital increases (\"Capital Increase\" entries), which do not appear here.\n\nOther entries (e.g., purchases, sales) are *NOT* paid-in capital. They represent operating activities, not capital provided by owners.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Find Paid-in Capital Entries**\n\nFrom your data, focusing on the **entries on 2023-12-31**:\n\n| id                  | type            | date       | amount     |\n|---------------------|----------------|------------|------------|\n| Initial20231231001  | Cash deposit   | 2023-12-31 | 3000000.0  |\n| Initial20231231001  | Bank deposit   | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0  |\n| Initial20231231001  | Fixed Assets   | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0  |\n\nAll three are parts of \"Initial\" capital investment (first record batch).  \nThese likely represent the **total capital contributed** at company start.\n\nSum them:\n- 3,000,000 (Cash)\n- 5,000,000 (Bank)\n- 5,000,000 (Fixed Assets)\n\n**Total Paid-in Capital (Initial):**\n\\[ 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000 \\text{ (thirteen million)} \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Are There Any Changes?**\n\nScrolled through all later entries (purchases, sales, expenses, depreciation, receivables) — none are labeled as capital addition or capital return.  \nNo indication that paid-in capital is increased, decreased, or shares repurchased; all are business activities, not owner investment.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nPaid-in capital remains unchanged from initial value.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Format the Solution**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'} }\n```\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
