Identify Cash Flow from Operations Items:\nWe will consider:\n- **Cash Inflows**: Cash received from customers (sales marked as \"Paid\" and \"Cash\" as payment method).\n- **Cash Outflows**: Cash paid to suppliers for purchases (except Fixed Assets), cash paid for operating expenses (Administrative, Sales, Financial Expenses), utility outflows, etc.\n\nExclude:\n- Opening Balances (Initial deposits, Fixed Assets)\n- Depreciation (non-cash)\n- Purchases and sales marked as \"Unpaid\" (these are accruals, not cash flows yet)\n- Interest Receivables (Unpaid, non-cash)\n- Purchases/sales of Fixed Assets (Investing cash flows)\n- Account transfer entries (none are present here) \n\nLet’s proceed stepwise:\n\n---\n\n### A.

(Bank Transfer)\n- 20000 (Bank Transfer)\n- 60000 (Bank Transfer)\n- 200000 (Bank Transfer)\n- 1000 (Bank Transfer)\n- 10000 (Bank Transfer)\n- 15000 (Bank Transfer)\n- 60000 (Bank Transfer)\n- 3000

**Total Cash Outflows:**  \n= Operating expenses: 564,653.21  \n+ Purchases to suppliers: 1,359,000.00  \n= **1,923,653.21**\n\n#### **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**\n\n= Cash Inflows - Cash Outflows  \n= 1,972,845.96 - 1,923,653.21 = **49,192.75**\n\n**But... this is suspiciously high; often, cash balances would decrease in a trading scenario unless significant cash sales occurred. Let's double-check:**\n\n- Did we miss \"Unpaid\" filtered out from sales? Yes, we only counted \"Paid\" sales.\n- Did we include all purchases as paid? Only those marked \"Paid\".\n\n**Now, do we need to adjust for opening balances? Initial Cash deposit & Initial Bank deposit are NOT operating activity cash flows—they are financing/investing activities; so, they are excluded.**\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"49192.75\"} }\n```",
