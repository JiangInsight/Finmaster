Since it's a cash flow statement, we want the change in accounts receivable due to credit sales and cash collections.\n\n**Step 2: Establish the period**\n\n- Initial balances are at 2023-12-31.\n- The transactions run through January and up to early February 2024.\n\nSo:\n- Opening Accounts Receivable: **Amount of A/R on 2023-12-31.**\n- Closing Accounts Receivable: **Amount of A/R at the end of the period, i.e., after 2024-02-05**.\n\nBut opening is likely **0**, unless shown otherwise.\n\n**Step 3: Find opening Accounts Receivable**\n\nWe need to see if any opening balance is given for A/R as of 2023-12-31.\n\nFrom the data:\n\n| Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | ... \n| Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | ... \n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | ... \n\nNo explicit initial A/R is given. So, opening A/R = **0**.\n\n**Step 4: Find all credit sales & collections (i.e., A/R movements)**\n\nA/R increases by the amount you *sell on credit* (i.e., sales with payment_method \"Account Receivable\" or similar, or payment/receipt_status \"Unpaid\" etc.).\n\nA/R decreases when you *collect cash* from customers (i.e., when those customers pay). Since the record doesn't show explicit collections from A/R (i.e., customer payments), we can assume that \"Paid\" status means sales where cash was collected at the time of sale, and \"Unpaid\" means a credit sale that increases A/R and likely remains uncollected unless otherwise shown.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate Closing Accounts Receivable**\n\nLet's sum up the total of *credit sales* (i.e., \"Unpaid\" sales or with receive_method \"Account Receivable\"). No receipts are shown that would reduce these, so closing A/R is the total amount of these sales in the period.\n\nLet's extract all the rows where:\n- type is \"Sale\"\n- AND payment/receipt_status is \"Unpaid\" OR receive_method is \"Account Receivable\"\n\n**List all relevant SALEs:**\n\nI'll scan the \"Sale\" lines.\n\n- Sale20240102001 | Sale | 2024-01-02 | ... | 53170.71 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240105005 | Sale | 2024-01-05 | ... | 2943.51 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240106009 | Sale | 2024-01-06 | ... | 262445.58 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240107011 | Sale | 2024-01-07 | ... | 192028.0 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240107012 | Sale | 2024-01-07 | ... | 52961.46 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240108016 | Sale | 2024-01-08 | ... | 2925.01 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240109020 | Sale | 2024-01-09 | ... | 10545.58 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240112024 | Sale | 2024-01-12 | ... | 242599.54 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240112026 | Sale | 2024-01-12 | ... | 243590.56 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240114030 | Sale | 2024-01-14 | ... | 190478.23 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240114031 | Sale | 2024-01-14 | ... | 48342.01 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240117036 | Sale | 2024-01-17 | ... | 2667.21 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240117037 | Sale | 2024-01-17 | ... | 10762.61 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240117038 | Sale | 2024-01-17 | ... | 2942.21 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240118041 | Sale | 2024-01-18 | ... | 250090.56 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240120044 | Sale | 2024-01-20 | ... | 58141.88 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240120045 | Sale | 2024-01-20 | ... | 1915.39 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240121047 | Sale | 2024-01-21 | ... | 53934.4 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240121048 | Sale | 2024-01-21 | ... | 181654.5 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240121049 | Sale | 2024-01-21 | ... | 12736.6 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240122050 | Sale | 2024-01-22 | ... | 11667.43 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240122051 | Sale | 2024-01-22 | ... | 52739.99 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240123053 | Sale | 2024-01-23 | ... | 196484.2 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240125056 | Sale | 2024-01-25 | ... | 11498.77 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240125057 | Sale | 2024-01-25 | ... | 53628.0 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240125058 | Sale | 2024-01-25 | ... | 218410.49 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240127060 | Sale | 2024-01-27 | ... | 2220.88 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240127061 | Sale | 2024-01-27 | ... | 46461.67 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240130064 | Sale | 2024-01-30 | ... | 13371.18 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240130065 | Sale | 2024-01-30 | ... | 58898.91 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240131068 | Sale | 2024-01-31 | ... | 53162.19 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240201072 | Sale | 2024-02-01 | ... | 14642.94 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240202074 | Sale | 2024-02-02 | ... | 44442.71 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240205076 | Sale | 2024-02-05 | ... | 292202.87 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n- Sale20240205077 | Sale | 2024-02-05 | ... | 37363.94 | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Receviable | ... |\n\nWhew.
