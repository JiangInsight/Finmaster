The end value of \"interest accrued but not yet received\" (i.e., Interest Receivable) \n  2. The net addition in \"cash and cash equivalents during the period\" (i.e., Net Increase or Net Change from Cash Flow Statement)\n\n- **Step 1: Find Interest Receivable in Balance Sheet**\n    - Line item: Interest Receivable | End_amount: 14575.80\n\n- **Step 2: Find Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**\n    - Go to Cash Flow Statement\n    - Look for \"Net Increase\" (can sometimes be \"Net Change\") under Cash and Cash Equivalents section\n    - Line: Net Increase | Amount: -650630.22\n\n- **Step 3: Place both values sequentially as value1 and value2**\n\nFinal answer as requested.",
