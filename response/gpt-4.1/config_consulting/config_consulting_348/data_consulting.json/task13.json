But strictly, using the formula as above:**\n\n5. **Final Answer:**  \n   Inventory Turnover Ratio = 22.30\n\n**But based on accounting prudence and common convention for a business that just began the period with zero inventory:**\n- If the ending inventory is small relative to full-period COGS, the ratio appears large, but that's mathematically correct.\n- So, as calculated above:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"22.30\"} }\n```\n\n**You may also see practitioners use the ending inventory directly for new businesses (then: 1,249,000/112,000=11.16), but the strict textbook approach for average is used here, following the example you gave.**",
