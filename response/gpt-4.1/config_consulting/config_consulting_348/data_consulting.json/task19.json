Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities**\n\n- From the ending balance sheet (2024-02-05):\n    - Current Assets = 9,625,738.03\n    - Current Liabilities = 628,478.02\n\n- Calculation:\n    - 9,625,738.03 / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.32\n\n---\n\n**2. Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory**\n   - Cost of Goods Sold = 1,249,000.00 (from income statement)\n   - Inventory (beginning, 2023-12-31) = 0.00\n   - Inventory (ending, 2024-02-05) = 112,000.00\n\n   - Average Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2\n   - Average Inventory = (0 + 112,000) / 2 = 56,000\n\n   - Inventory Turnover Ratio = 1,249,000 / 56,000 ≈ 22.3\n\n**BUT**, based on the example provided, zero beginning inventory is not used as literal zero for the denominator since the company likely started new operations or had no opening inventory, so the ratio should be computed as:\n   - Inventory Turnover = COGS / Ending Inventory = 1,249,000 / 112,000 ≈ 11.16\n\n**However**, the example used average, even if beginning inventory was 0.\n   - To be consistent with the example, use average inventory: 56,000\n   - So, 1,249,000 / 56,000 ≈ 22.3\n\n**Wait:** Example (for earlier period):\n   - Inventory (begin): 0, Inventory (end): 5,090,000, so average 2,545,000\n   - COGS: 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73 (matches their solution, so average inventory IS used even if it begins at zero).\n\nSo, for this problem:\n   - Inventory Turnover Ratio = 1,249,000 / 56,000 ≈ 22.3\n\n**But the answer above states 13.33. That corresponds to using ending inventory: 1,249,000 / 112,000 ≈ 11.16, but they wrote 13.33. Let’s check.**\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a data entry error or a more nuanced method is assumed. But by the example, they use average inventory.\n\n**Final answers (rounded to two decimals):**\n- Current Ratio: 15.32\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio: 22.30\n\nSo, my corrected final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Current Ratio\": \"15.32\", \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"22.30\"}}\n```",
