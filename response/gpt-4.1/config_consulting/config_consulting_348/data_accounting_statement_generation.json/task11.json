Only assets are needed here.)\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2.1: Fixed Assets (net)**\n\n- Opening: 5,000,000  \n- Depreciation records:\n  - 2024-01-01: 45,756.35\n  - 2024-02-01: 45,752.90\n  - **Total Depreciation:** 45,756.35 + 45,752.90 = 91,509.25\n\n- **Closing Net Fixed Assets:** 5,000,000 - 91,509.25 = **4,908,490.75**\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2.2: Inventory / Purchases Not Expensed**\n\nLet's sum all purchases (\"Purchase\" type) and \"Paid\" status and \"Unpaid\" (inventory on hand or not paid for yet).\n\nAll the purchases since opening up to 2024-02-05:\n\nSum all \"Purchase\" types and \"Recorded Amount\":\n\n| ID                | Amount   |\n|-------------------|----------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | 60,000   | Unpaid (A/P)  \n| Purchase20231231002 | 100,000  | Paid\n| Purchase20231231003 |   3,000  | Paid \n| Purchase20231231004 |   5,000  | Paid \n| Purchase20231231005 | 15,000   | Paid \n| Purchase20231231006 | 60,000   | Unpaid (A/P)\n| Purchase20231231007 | 10,000   | Unpaid (A/P)\n| Purchase20231231008 | 300,000  | Paid \n| Purchase20231231009 | 20,000   | Paid \n| Purchase20231231010 |   5,000  | Paid \n| Purchase20231231011 | 300,000  | Unpaid (A/P)\n| Purchase20231231012 | 60,000   | Paid \n| Purchase20231231013 | 200,000  | Paid \n| Purchase20231231014 |   2,000  | Unpaid (A/P)\n| Purchase20231231015 |   3,000  | Paid \n| Purchase20231231016 | 40,000   | Unpaid (A/P)\n| Purchase20231231017 | 10,000   | Paid \n| Purchase20231231018 | 15,000   | Paid \n| Purchase20231231019 | 60,000   | Paid \n| Purchase20231231020 | 20,000   | Paid \n| Purchase20231231021 |   3,000  | Unpaid (A/P)\n| Purchase20231231022 | 10,000   | Unpaid (A/P)\n| Purchase20231231023 | 60,000   | Paid |\n\nNote: Consulting/solution inventory is not really tangible asset, but given all purchases are not immediately expensed, until used the \"unpaid\" values could possibly be considered as inventory (if treated as so). Alternatively, these may have been \"expensed\" upon purchase (if service/delivered) but let's follow the pattern.\n\nTraditional approach: Purchases are expensed when used; otherwise, ending inventory is (Purchases + opening inv - cost of sales).  \nGiven no opening inventory, everything purchased and not expensed is ending inventory.\n\nBut in the example dataset, **\"Purchases\" are likely service purchases not tangible inventory**, but may simply have been expensed as soon as incurred.  \nFor this service company, we can probably treat purchases as fully consumed (not accumulating inventory), unless specifically stored.\n\nThus, **no inventory balance** need to be carried.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2.3: Account Receivables (from sales not yet paid)**\n\nFrom \"Sale\" rows with \"Unpaid\" as payment/receipt_status, sum \"amount.\" (Exclude \"Paid\": already in cash/bank; exclude any fully paid sales.)\n\nLet's sum those:\n\n| ID                | Amount   |\n|-------------------|----------|\n| Sale20240103002   | 42,365.71|\n| Sale20240103003   |210,203.88|\n| Sale20240105007   | 14,282.89|\n| Sale20240105008   | 57,947.08|\n| Sale20240105009   |  2,074.66|\n| Sale20240106011   |  2,971.81|\n| Sale20240107013   |  2,160.53|\n| Sale20240107014   | 43,879.89|\n| Sale20240115020   | 10,791.32|\n| Sale20240115021   | 41,521.81|\n| Sale20240117024   |220,256.39|\n| Sale20240117025   | 59,992.23|\n| Sale20240118028   | 57,321.13|\n| Sale20240121035   |232,916.62|\n| Sale20240121036   |188,606.93|\n| Sale20240123039   | 48,078.98|\n| Sale20240124041   | 12,006.12|\n| Sale20240126044   | 52,600.07|\n| Sale20240126045   |218,551.72|\n| Sale20240128051   | 40,096.08|\n| Sale20240129053   |  2,994.10|\n| Sale20240129054   | 13,434.22|\n| Sale20240130055   | 55,638.81|\n| Sale20240131058   | 13,921.69|\n| Sale20240131059   |276,920.02|\n| Sale20240202063   |195,343.26|\n| Sale20240202064   | 13,709.42|\n| Sale20240202065   | 10,969.01|\n| Sale20240203066   |  2,658.79|\n| Sale20240203067   |  2,842.50|\n| Sale20240203068   |  2,734.78|\n\n(Add up those amounts:)\n\nLet's sum:\n\n42,365.71  \n210,203.88  \n14,282.89  \n57,947.08  \n2,074.66  \n2,971.81  \n2,160.53  \n43,879.89  \n10,791.32  \n41,521.81  \n220,256.39  \n59,992.23  \n57,321.13  \n232,916.62  \n188,606.93  \n48,078.98  \n12,006.12  \n52,600.07  \n218,551.72  \n40,096.08  \n2,994.10  \n13,434.22  \n55,638.81  \n13,921.69  \n276,920.02  \n195,343.26  \n13,709.42  \n10,969.01  \n2,658.79  \n2,842.50  \n2,734.78  \n\nTotal:\nLet’s compute step by step:\n\n|  Amount  |   Running Total  |\n|----------|------------------|\n| 42,365.71|     42,365.71    |\n|210,203.88|    252,569.59    |\n| 14,282.89|    266,852.48    |\n| 57,947.08|    324,799.56    |\n|  2,074.66|    326,874.22    |\n|  2,971.81|    329,846.03    |\n|  2,160.53|    332,006.56    |\n| 43,879.89|    375,886.45    |\n| 10,791.32|    386,677.77    |\n| 41,521.81|    428,199.58    |\n|220,256.39|    648,455.97    |\n| 59,992.23|    708,448.20    |\n| 57,321.13|    765,769.33    |\n|232,916.62|    998,685.95    |\n|188,606.93|  1,187,292.88    |\n| 48,078.98|  1,235,371.86    |\n| 12,006.12|  1,247,377.98    |\n| 52,600.07|  1,299,978.05    |\n|218,551.72|  1,518,529.77    |\n| 40,096.08|  1,558,625.85    |\n|  2,994.10|  1,561,619.95    |\n| 13,434.22|  1,575,054.17    |\n| 55,638.81|  1,630,692.98    |\n| 13,921.69|  1,644,614.67    |\n|276,920.02|  1,921,534.69    |\n|195,343.26|  2,116,877.95    |\n| 13,709.42|  2,130,587.37    |\n| 10,969.01|  2,141,556.38    |\n|  2,658.79|  2,144,215.17    |\n|  2,842.50|  2,147,057.67    |\n|  2,734.78|  2,149,792.45    |\n\n**Total Account Receivable: 2,149,792.45**\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2.4: Interest Receivables (not yet received)**\n\nThese are all the \"Interest Receivables\" entries, sum of their amount:\n\nLet’s sum all Interest Receivable \"amount\" values (positive values only, as expected;

Continue for all Paid sales...\n\nBut since all paid sales subtotal will equal \"Total sales revenue - uncollected AR\", and we have summed all unpaid sales, we can compute total sales revenue and subtract AR entries to get collected (cash) sales:\n\n- Total Sales = Sum all \"Sale\" entries  \n- Subtract total AR sales (from unpaid list above) = \"Cash-received\" sales\n\nLet's sum all \"Sale\" entries for \"amount\":\n\nAll \"Sale\" entries (sum \"amount\" field):\n\nSumming all from dataset (and in order to avoid mistake, sum all amount of \"Sale\" rows), then sum all AR (already summed above), difference is the cash received from sales.\n\nLet's list all \"Sale\" \"amount\" values:\n\n- Sale20240103002    42,365.71    Unpaid\n- Sale20240103003   210,203.88    Unpaid\n- Sale20240105007    14,282.89    Unpaid\n- Sale20240105008    57,947.08    Unpaid\n- Sale20240105009     2,074.66    Unpaid\n- Sale20240106010     9,788.79    Paid\n- Sale20240106011     2,971.81    Unpaid\n- Sale20240107013     2,160.53    Unpaid\n- Sale20240107014    43,879.89    Unpaid\n- Sale20240108015    53,770.35    Paid\n- Sale20240112018     9,794.76    Paid\n- Sale20240115020    10,791.32    Unpaid\n- Sale20240115021    41,521.81    Unpaid\n- Sale20240117024   220,256.39    Unpaid\n- Sale20240117025    59,992.23    Unpaid\n- Sale20240117026    12,449.82    Paid\n- Sale20240118028    57,321.13    Unpaid\n- Sale20240118029   254,654.80    Paid\n- Sale20240119031   202,361.10    Paid\n- Sale20240120033     9,687.98    Paid\n- Sale20240121035   232,916.62    Unpaid\n- Sale20240121036   188,606.93    Unpaid\n- Sale20240123039    48,078.98    Unpaid\n- Sale20240124041    12,006.12    Unpaid\n- Sale20240126044    52,600.07    Unpaid\n- Sale20240126045   218,551.72    Unpaid\n- Sale20240126046    49,951.71    Paid\n- Sale20240128050    11,095.98    Paid\n- Sale20240128051    40,096.08    Unpaid\n- Sale20240129053     2,994.10    Unpaid\n- Sale20240129054    13,434.22    Unpaid\n- Sale20240130055    55,638.81    Unpaid\n- Sale20240131057    56,577.75    Paid\n- Sale20240131058    13,921.69    Unpaid\n- Sale20240131059   276,920.02    Unpaid\n- Sale20240201061     2,061.60    Paid\n- Sale20240202063   195,343.26    Unpaid\n- Sale20240202064    13,709.42    Unpaid\n- Sale20240202065    10,969.01    Unpaid\n- Sale20240203066     2,658.79    Unpaid\n- Sale20240203067     2,842.50    Unpaid\n- Sale20240203068     2,734.78    Unpaid\n- Sale20240204069    44,816.04    Paid\n- Sale20240204070     2,757.29    Paid\n\nNow, sum:\n\nPaid sales:\n9,788.79  \n53,770.35  \n9,794.76  \n12,449.82  \n254,654.80  \n202,361.10  \n9,687.98  \n49,951.71  \n11,095.98  \n56,577.75  \n2,061.60  \n44,816.04  \n2,757.29  \n\nLet’s sum stepwise:\n\n9,788.79  \n+53,770.35 = 63,559.14  \n+9,794.76 = 73,353.90  \n+12,449.82 = 85,803.72  \n+254,654.80 = 340,458.52  \n+202,361.10 = 542,819.62  \n+9,687.98 = 552,507.60  \n+49,951.71 = 602,459.31  \n+11,095.98 = 613,555.29  \n+56,577.75 = 670,133.04  \n+2,061.60 = 672,194.64  \n+44,816.04 = 717,010.68  \n+2,757.29 = 719,767.97\n\n--> **Total Cash Sales: 719,767.97**\n\n---\n\n#### 2.5.2 **Sum of Outflows (\"Paid\" purchases and all expenses paid)**\n\nAdd up:\n- All \"Purchase\" entries with status \"Paid\" (regardless of payment method)\n- All \"Expense\" entries with status \"Paid\"\n- Plus possibly \"Depreciation\": but that's not cash, so not a cash outflow\n- \"Financial Expenses\" and \"Admin\" and \"Sales\" Expenses all \"Paid\" entries\n\nFirst, all paid Purchases (\"Paid\" in payment status):\n\nFrom the \"Purchase\" list (ignoring \"Unpaid\" ones):\n\n| ID                | Amount   |\n|-------------------|----------|\n| Purchase20231231002|100,000.00|\n| Purchase20231231003|  3,000.00|\n| Purchase20231231004|  5,000.00|\n| Purchase20231231005| 15,000.00|\n| Purchase20231231009| 20,000.00|\n| Purchase20231231010|  5,000.00|\n| Purchase20231231012| 60,000.00|\n| Purchase20231231013|200,000.00|\n| Purchase20231231015|  3,000.00|\n| Purchase20231231017| 10,000.00|\n| Purchase20231231018| 15,000.00|\n| Purchase20231231019| 60,000.00|\n| Purchase20231231020| 20,000.00|\n| Purchase20231231023| 60,000.00|\n| Purchase20231231008|300,000.00|\n\nSum:\n100,000  \n+3,000 = 103,000  \n+5,000 = 108,000  \n+15,000 = 123,000  \n+20,000 = 143,000  \n+5,000 = 148,000  \n+60,000 = 208,000  \n+200,000 = 408,000  \n+3,000 = 411,000  \n+10,000 = 421,000  \n+15,000 = 436,000  \n+60,000 = 496,000  \n+20,000 = 516,000  \n+60,000 = 576,000  \n+300,000 = 876,000\n\n**Total Purchases Paid: 876,000.00**\n\n---\n\nNext, sum all Expenses \"Paid\" (all \"Expense\" entries;
