In most basic income statements, total expenses include:\n- Purchases (cost of sales, COGS)\n- Expenses (selling, admin, financial, depreciation, etc.)\nBut **NOT** 'Interest Receivables' (those are income).\n\n## Step 2: List relevant transactions and their amounts\n\n### Purchases\n- Purchase20231231001 | Purchase | amount: 60,000.00\n- Purchase20231231002 | Purchase | amount: 100,000.00\n-
