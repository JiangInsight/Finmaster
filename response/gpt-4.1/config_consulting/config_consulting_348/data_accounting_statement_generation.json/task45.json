                        "content": "Let's reason step by step:\n\n## 1. What are Cash Flows from Investing Activities?\nCash flows from investing activities typically include **cash paid to acquire or cash received from sale of long-term assets**, such as property, plant, and equipment (PPE), intangible assets, investments, fixed assets, etc.\n\n**This EXCLUDES**: purchases of inventory (which are operating), interest received (operating/investing, but in this style it's considered in operating), depreciation (non-cash), receipts from accounts receivable (operating), any expense items, etc.\n\n## 2. Pinpoint relevant transactions in the table above\nLet's scan for transactions that are investing activities. We are looking for:\n- Cash outflows to acquire Fixed Assets/long-term assets\n- Cash inflows from sale of Fixed Assets/long-term assets\n\n### Review, line by line:\n#### Initial balances:  \n- Cash deposit: NO (not an investing activity)\n- Bank deposit: NO\n- Fixed Assets: The \"Initial\" line for Fixed Assets is likely an **opening balance** entry, not a cash purchase in the period (since lumped together with cash/bank opening). **NOT a cash flow**.\n\n#### Purchases:\n- All \"Purchase\" lines are for consulting/services/products (e.g., Premium Consulting, Enterprise Solution, Basic Consulting, Standard Consulting). These are likely **inventory/services** for operations, not fixed assets (i.e., operating cash flows).\n\n#### Depreciation/Interest/Sale/Expense:  \n- **Depreciation**: NON-cash, ignore\n- **Interest Receivable**: NOT an investing activity, as per previous handling (mostly operating)\n- **Sales**: All relate to consulting/services (again, operating)\n- **Administrative/Sales/Financial Expenses**: Operating activities.\n\n#### Are there any Fixed Asset purchases?\n**No concrete transaction says \"Fixed Asset Purchase\" or e.g., \"Building/Equipment purchase\" or similarly identifiable asset acquisition in this period.**\n\n#### Only possible non-operating cash flows:\n- The only line with a fixed asset number is the initial \"Fixed Assets\" line, apparently as part of opening balances, **not a cash flow this period**.\n- No \"Fixed Asset\" purchases like in the example you provided are seen in this period.\n\n## 3. Conclusion  \n**There are no investing activities in the provided data for this period, as per standard cash flow statement practice.**\n\n## 4. Solution formatting\nPer instruction, if no investing cash flows: return 0.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"0\"} }\n```",
