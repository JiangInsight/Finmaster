Identify Opening Balance:\nWe are asked for the final **Beginning Cash and Cash Equivalents** as would appear in a cash flow statement.\n\n#### From the Data:\n- There are two entries for the initial cash and bank deposit:\n    - Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n    - Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n\n**Total initial cash and cash equivalents = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000.00**\n\n#### There is also an \"Initial | Fixed Assets\" entry for 5,000,000, but this is NOT a cash/cash equivalent; it's an allocation to fixed assets (typically a non-cash, non-cash equivalent item). Only cash and bank deposits count for \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\".\n\n### 2. Verify by Example\nThe structure is **exactly** the same as the given example (the first few lines). The answer in the example for such a data structure, where there are only these initial deposits and no offsetting cash withdrawals before the start of the period, is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'} }\n```\n\n### 3. Check for Early Payments Before Start Date\nThe only entries with payment before 2024-01-01 (i.e., in 2023-12-31) are:\n- Purchases (some paid by Bank Transfer, some by Cash) \n- No purchases paid by cash or bank before start (all relevant for cash flow would affect the closing not the beginning balance—unless paid in cash at that time)\n\nBut—they are all paid at the same time as funds are deposited—the cash is INPUT first, these are same as in the example. They're not earlier balances to deduct.\n\n### 4. Final Reasoning:\n- The cash and cash equivalents at \"beginning\" will show the total deposits (cash, bank) **before** any 2024 transactions.\n- No payments or withdrawals are made before 2024-01-01 that would reduce the opening balance (they're not explicit withdrawals before opening).\n- All other payments and cash flows in 2024 or later affect the *ending* and not the beginning.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
