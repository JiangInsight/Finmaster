NET CASH FLOW\n\n- **Net Cash From Operations = Cash in - Cash out = 719,767.97 - 662,498.19 = 57,269.78**\n- But this is only the period activity!

Initial and Final Cash\n\n#### Opening cash equivalents:  \n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000  \n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000  \n=> **8,000,000**\n\nBut, since the \"Initial\" entries are for opening balances, and we tracked all receipts and all payments during the period, this net is the change during the period: i.e. (inflow - outflow), because if the only entries are opening balances and the flows are all included thereafter, and no closing cash balance is given, this operating net is the net increase.\n\nAlso, \"Fixed Assets\" entry in initial is not related to cash increase/decrease over the period—it just affects opening balances for the asset.\n\n#### So **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents over the period is:**\n**Cash Inflows (receipts) - Cash Outflows (paid) = 719,767.97 - 662,498.19 = 57,269.78**\n\n---\n\n## FINAL ANSWER (rounded to 2 decimals):\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"57269.78\"} }\n```\n",
