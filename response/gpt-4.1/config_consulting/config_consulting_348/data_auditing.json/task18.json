Initial20231231001:  \n- The `invoice` for \"Initial20231231001\" is described as *\"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Cash deposit, totaling $3,000,000.00\"* in the first row, and in subsequent rows for the same ID, for \"Bank deposit\" ($5,000,000) and \"Fixed Assets\" ($5,000,000).\n- The sum of cash + bank deposit (3,000,000 + 5,000,000) = $8,000,000, but Fixed Assets is also $5,000,000, probably being double-counted for balancing/fund flows. The description in the invoice indicates some confusion between categories and actual cash flow, typical in opening entries, but by field logic and invoice standard, these represent different facets of the same transaction and should be harmonized. Flag as inconsistent split/duplication of the same event.\n\n### 2. Sale20240103003:\n- The `invoice` says: \"consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $210203.88, totaling $210,203.88... cost amount $100,000, tax $10,510.19, after-tax $199,693.69... unpaid.\"\n- But: \n  - `recorded_amount` is **0.00** instead of $210,203.88,\n  - `recorded_quantity` is **0.0** instead of 1.0,\n  - `recorded_profit` is **135,051.11** instead of 110,203.88\n  - `payment/receipt_status` is **Paid** instead of Unpaid.\n- The correct values—per the most reliable invoice text—should be: {amount=210,203.88, quantity=1.0, profit=110,203.88, payment/receipt_status=Unpaid}.\n\n---\n\nIf you would like more inconsistencies extracted or the data above handled further, please specify.",
