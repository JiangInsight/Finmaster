This is unlikely unless the initial capital injection was split into separate transactions recorded under different asset categories. However, the total injected capital on the invoice should match the sum or split appropriately.\n- **Recorded values**: recorded_types = Cash deposit (3,000,000), Bank deposit (5,000,000), Fixed Assets (5,000,000). But Bank deposit and Fixed Assets both say 5,000,000 for the same id, suggesting an overlap or possible misallocation.\n- **Best estimate based on other fields (esp. invoice, which is considered reliable)**: The invoice for `Initial20231231001` likely refers to a single initial capital injection which was distributed as 3,000,000 in cash (cash deposit), 5,000,000 in the bank (bank deposit), and possibly also recorded as 5,000,000 in fixed assets. However, fixed assets and bank deposit entries shouldn't both sum to more than the total capital injection, unless they're double-booking some or all of the value.\n- **Suggested values**: The entry likely should reflect only the \"original category\"/\"capital injection\" as a single bundled amount and disaggregate into sub-accounts in internal ledgers, not as separate competing 'transactions' with the same id and full value.\n- **Output**: For this id, the category and amounts are most likely split incorrectly or double-booked; consolidated, the initial injection should be 8,000,000 (3M+5M), with no duplicate 5M for both bank and fixed assets based on typical initial injection practices.\n\nIf you are looking for inconsistencies on other id records, please specify which row/id.
