However, the invoice refers only to a `Cash deposit` for $3,000,000.00. The entries with `Bank deposit`, `Fixed Assets` and `$5,000,000.00` do not match the invoice and are not substantiated. Thus, the correct value is `Cash deposit, 3,000,000.00`.\n\n2. **Sale20240131057**: The invoice states that the tax amount is $2,828.89 (from after-tax: 53,748.86 = 56,577.75 - 2,828.89), but the recorded field lists 46,678.25 as tax, which is almost as much as the total, a clear error. The correct value per invoice is $2,828.89.\n\nNo other clear inconsistencies were detected where the invoice provided clear, contradictory evidence to the recorded fields for these records.
