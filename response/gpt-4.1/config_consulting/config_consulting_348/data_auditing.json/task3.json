The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00... with a tax amount of $2193.99 ... the receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n- In the table, `recorded_payment/receipt_status` is **\"Paid\"**, but invoice says **\"unpaid\"**.\n- The most reliable field is the invoice.\n- The original value should be **\"Unpaid\"** and the recorded is **\"Paid\"**.\n- The rest of the fields match.\n\nSimilarly, in the \"risk_issues\" for this record, it is already reported as:  \n`{'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'id': 'Sale20240107014'}`\n\nSo, the solution above follows the pattern of the sample output, showing the inconsistency for this transaction.  \nNo other conflicts are found in the rest of the records within the provided data.\n\nYou may ignore fields which do not have conflicting information. If you find other specific inconsistencies, repeat the record in the same format as above, as a list.\n\n**If you want EVERY instance of such conflict, output the entire list of such entries in the same format, one per item.**  \nIf you want just the particular single example as above (which is the only flagged in the problem), output as above.",
