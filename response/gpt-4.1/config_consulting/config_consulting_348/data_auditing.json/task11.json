and correct corresponding amounts, but they all use the same id). Each row has different amount and category, so they contradict each other for the same transaction id.\n- For `Purchase20231231023`, the \"preparer\" is missing in the recorded data but present in the invoice description as \"Supervisor.\" This is an error in the 'Recorded Preparer' field.\n- All other entries are consistent internally (matching invoice, amounts, preparer/approver, etc.) and do not show internal inconsistencies within a row for this sample. If you wish to check more, expand the JSON above.\n",
