The cost amount for this transaction was $1000.00, with a tax amount of $103.08, leading to a total amount due of $1958.52. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n   - Therefore, from the invoice text (viewed as highly reliable):\n     - Unit price should be $2061.60\n     - Total amount should be $2061.60\n\n2. **Recorded Fields:**\n   - In the provided transaction record:\n     - `recorded_unit_price`: 2317.93\n     - `recorded_amount`: 2560.77\n\n3. **Internal Calculations:**\n   - The product is for 1.0 unit, so amount and price should be identical for both correct and recorded values.\n\n4. **Discrepancy:**\n   - Both the unit price and the amount are higher in the recorded data than what the invoice (standardized) says they should be.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The correct values should be:\n     - Unit price: 2061.60\n     - Total amount: 2061.60\n\n6. **No other internal inconsistencies are highlighted for other fields in this record. Other entries in the problem have no mismatches between invoice (text) and row data. This is the single row displaying inconsistency, as in the example.",
