We check each transaction for internal inconsistencies by comparing the structured fields to the (generally more reliable) invoice statement for that row.\n2. In most transactions, fields match the breakdown in the invoice (e.g., amount = quantity × unit price, etc.).\n3. For transaction `Sale20240202065`, the *invoice states*:  \n   \"a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $10969.01, totaling $10969.01.\"\n   \n   However, in the table, the `recorded_unit_price` is 11452.46, which does **not** match the value in the invoice (`10969.01`). The `recorded_amount` is 10969.01, matching the invoice and not matching the `recorded_unit_price` × quantity.\n4. Given invoice information is considered more reliable, the correct unit price should be 10969.01 as stated in the invoice, not 11452.46.\n5. Thus, \"Original price\" (invoice/unit price per invoice): 10969.01, \"Recorded price\": 11452.46, id: \"Sale20240202065\".\n\n_Note: The similar process would be repeated for each transaction, but in this case, only one is shown with an inconsistency in unit price._",
