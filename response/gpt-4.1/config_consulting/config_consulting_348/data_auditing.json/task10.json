For the three \"Initial20231231001\" rows, the `id` is identical but `recorded_type` and `recorded_amount` differ. The invoice field (as per the instruction) represents three different types and amounts ($3,000,000 cash deposit, $5,000,000 bank deposit, $5,000,000 fixed assets). Either the id should differ per type/amount, or the records are intermingled. So the cross-mapping between type and amounts is an inconsistency.\n\n2. For \"Expense20240101001\", two entries exist for the same id on the same date, one for \"Administrative Expenses\" ($28,208.73) and one for \"Sales Expenses\" ($12,654.40). According to the invoice, both categories exist on that day but with swapped amounts. The preparer is different between the rows, too, and is inconsistent with the respective invoice line. The best solution is that the two records have swapped amounts/categories (and preparers).\n\n3. For \"Sale20240128051\", the row records profit as 22070.23, but according to the invoice, the profit should be 40096.08 (amount) - 20000.00 (cost) = 20096.08. The \"Recorded profit\" is 22070.23 (which is more than possible). So the profit field is inconsistent; the correct value is 20096.08.\n\nIf you need the list in a flatter or more concise format, let me know!",
