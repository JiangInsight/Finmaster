These do not match the reliable invoice description.\n    - All other fields are either blank or matching the invoice (cash, paid, 1.0 unit).\n    - The correct values should be: category 'Sale', date '2024-02-04', quantity '1.0', unit price '2757.29', amount '2757.29', payment/receipt_status 'Paid', payment_method 'Cash', receive_method 'Cash', tax '137.86', cost per unit '1000.0' (by deduction from cost in previous similar entries, but not given directly in row), customer id and product are correct as per invoice.\n\n**Fields left blank are either (a) missing in both, (b) identical, or (c) correct as per the most reliable field (the invoice).**",
