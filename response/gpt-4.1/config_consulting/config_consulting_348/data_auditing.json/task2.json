`recorded_date` is 2024-03-02 but the invoice says \"On February 02, 2024\". Thus, the correct value for `recorded_date` should be `2024-02-02`.\n- For the others, there may be category name or class differences (e.g., ‘Initial Capital’ vs. ‘Cash deposit’), but as long as the amount, unit price, quantity, method, and counterparties match between the fields and the invoice (which is considered more authoritative), they are not true inconsistencies—just translation/terminology variants.\n\nIf you want only the true identified inconsistency (like the example solution), here it is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"Original category\": null,\n    \"Recorded category\": null,\n    \"Original date\": \"2024-02-02\",\n    \"Recorded date\": \"2024-03-02\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Original payment_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n    \"Original quantity\": null,\n    \"Recorded quantity\": null,\n    \"Original price\": null,\n    \"Recorded price\": null,\n    \"Original receive_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": null,\n    \"Original amount\": null,\n    \"Recorded amount\": null,\n    \"Original tax\": null,\n    \"Recorded tax\": null,\n    \"Original profit\": null,\n    \"Recorded profit\": null,\n    \"Original Preparer\": null,\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n    \"Original Approver\": null,\n    \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240202063\"\n}}\n```\nAll other entries have their `recorded` information consistent with the invoice (\"problem\" field), or there is insufficient detail to conclude a mismatch.",
