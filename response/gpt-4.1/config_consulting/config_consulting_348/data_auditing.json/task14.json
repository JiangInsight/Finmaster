Assets\"), but all have the same id and date. Each of the three is mutually exclusive (you cannot have all three types for the same transaction id) and the invoice amounts also conflict. According to the invoices, there are two amounts ($3,000,000 for Cash deposit and $5,000,000 for both Bank deposit and Fixed Assets), which is inconsistent. It's most likely that these are entry or classification errors and should be split to unique transaction IDs, or one record is correct and the rest are mistakenly repeated under the same id.\n\n2. **Expense entries**: There are multiple Expense entries with the same id and date, but different categories (e.g., \"Sales Expenses\" and \"Administrative Expenses\" both for Expense20240101001, Expense20240102001, etc.). According to invoice, the category (Sales vs. Administrative Expenses) is sometimes mismatched, indicating at least one category is not matching invoice wording.\n\n3. **Sale20240121036**: According to the invoice, this a sale of 1 unit at 188606.93. In the row, recorded quantity is 0.0, but invoice says 1.0. Payment status is \"Paid\", but invoice context (\"The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid\") shows \"Unpaid\". Amount is 0.0, but invoice says 188606.93. \n\n**Note:** Repetitive purchase/expense/sale entries with identical date and id but different amounts are allowed if multiple items are on a single voucher, as often in such accounting systems. Inconsistencies are only reported if they contradict strongly or invoice/prose explicitly states one category/amount/unit and the entries differ from that.\n\nIf you need a different selection of issues or prefer to focus on different columns, please clarify!",
