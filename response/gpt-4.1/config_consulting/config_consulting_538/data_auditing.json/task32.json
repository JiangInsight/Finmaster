The payment_method of this transaction was bank transfer, and this transaction was paid. This transaction was prepared by Staff, and the approver is Director. The supplier ID is S010, and the supplier name is Supplier 10.\"\n- The recorded row has:\n    - recorded_date: 2024-01-29, but invoice date is 2023-12-31.\n    - recorded_quantity: 2.0, but invoice says 3.0 units.\n    - recorded_unit_price: 801.72, but invoice says $1000.00.\n    - recorded_amount: 2000.0, but invoice says $3000.00.\n- Other fields (payment_method, preparer, approver) match between the invoice and record, so no need to flag those.\n- No discrepancies for payment/receipt_status, receive_method, tax, profit fields (not available/irrelevant in this context).\n- Thus, the fields with inconsistencies are: date, quantity, unit price (price), and amount.\n\nIf you want a list of *all* inconsistencies in the table above, please clarify. This is the only one with explicit MISMATCH between invoice and row data in the records shown above.",
