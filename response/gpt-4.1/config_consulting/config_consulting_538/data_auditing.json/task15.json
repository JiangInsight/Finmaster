The risk_issues for `Sale20240111022` indicate two things: the Original category per invoice is 'Sale', but the recorded_type is 'Sales Expenses'; and the quantity per invoice is 1.0, but recorded_quantity is 0.0.\n2. The invoice says: \"On January 11, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $46958.27, totaling $46958.27...\" but `recorded_type == 'Sales Expenses'`, `recorded_quantity == 0.0`, `recorded_amount == 0.0`.\n3. The correct values per the invoice should be:\n   - 'Sale' (not 'Sales Expenses') for category/type\n   - Quantity: 1.0 (not zero)\n   - Amount: $46958.27 (not zero)\n   - The rest of the fields, such as receive_method, payment/receipt_status, tax, profit, etc., are consistent with the invoice.\n4. The fields with errors or mismatches are: category/type (recorded_type), quantity, amount; the rest (tax, price, receive method) match the invoice.\n5. The Original values are determined by the invoice, which is considered more reliable.\n6. Preparer and Approver fields are not given in the invoice, so left null.\n\nTherefore, the above JSON completes the required task.",
