On the repeated \"Initial20231231001\" entry:\n\nThere are three entries with the same ID, but the invoice text and amounts differ:\n- Cash deposit: $3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: $5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets: $5,000,000.00\n\nBut since the invoice actually says \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Bank deposit, totaling $5,000,000.00,\" and another for Cash deposit, these are all using the same transaction ID for what should be distinct initial asset categories. The amounts also mismatch.\n- So the \"Bank deposit\" entry was likely overwritten by the \"Cash deposit\" one in the records, and the \"Fixed Assets\" one is possibly also a collateral entry for the same ID.\n\n#### 2. Sale20240111023:\n- 'recorded_quantity' is 0.0, but according to the invoice and 'recorded_unit_price', it should be 1.0 and 'recorded_amount' should be 256579.57 (not 0.0).\n- The 'recorded_payment/receipt_status' is \"Paid\" but invoice context and standard logic for account receivable means original status should be \"Unpaid\".\n\n#### (All other entries are consistent with their invoice.)",
