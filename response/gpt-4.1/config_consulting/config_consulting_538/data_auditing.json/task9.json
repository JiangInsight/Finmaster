This is a clear data entry error.\n\n2. **All other fields in the record are consistent with the invoice/row's own numbers.  \nThere are no other fields with a clear, contradictory entry versus what should be there per invoice.**\n\n3. **So:**\n   - Only the `recorded_tax_amount` field is wrong.\n   - The correct value is $477.66 (per invoice and calculation).\n   - The record value is $7415.65.\n\n**Format according to instruction:**\n- Fill all other fields as null/blank (since they're not wrong for that row/transaction).\n- Provide ID and both recorded/would-be-correct value for the tax field.",
