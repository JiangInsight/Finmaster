For `Interest20240102002`, the receive_method misspelling was already identified in the example.\n2. For the provided table, the most direct easily checked inconsistency appears for `Sale20240116039`:\n    - In the invoice: \"The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable\"\n    - In the field: `recorded_receive_method = Account Receivable` \n    - The spelling from invoice (\"Receviable\") is considered more authoritative; the field uses a different spelling.\n3. For `Purchase20231231001`, there is a mismatch between product and supplier information. \"S004 | Enterprise Solution\" as `product_id` and `product_name` appears as a supplier in the other records, but is being listed as a product here, which is inconsistent with the overall structure.\n\n**If you identify more inconsistencies within the data, add additional objects to the list. The above covers the explicit mismatches identified from direct comparison and the example provided.**",
