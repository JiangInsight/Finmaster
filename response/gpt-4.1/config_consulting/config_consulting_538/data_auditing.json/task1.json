The only clear error is the mis-categorization.\n- If additional errors (in amounts, payment method, etc.) exist elsewhere, they are not apparent based on the invoice or the tabular data provided.\n\nIf you want a structured listing of all inconsistencies for every record, list the ids and inconsistencies in the same format. Above is the only inconsistency detected in your input.",
