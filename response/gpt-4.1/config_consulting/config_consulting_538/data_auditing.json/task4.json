All other fields are aligned with the invoice. \n- According to the invoice (which is standardized and reliable), the correct value for `payment_method` is \"Cash\", not \"Account Payable\".\n- Thus, there is an inconsistency in the field `payment_method` for id `\"Expense20240205001\"`, and the fix is as captured above. \n- All other fields are consistent with the invoice.",
