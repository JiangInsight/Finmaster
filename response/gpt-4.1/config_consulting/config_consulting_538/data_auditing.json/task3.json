One as Cash deposit, amount 3,000,000\n  2. One as Bank deposit, amount 5,000,000\n  3. One as Fixed Assets, amount 5,000,000\n- But only a single standardized, regulated invoice exists for each logical transaction, according to the description.\n- Both the \"Bank deposit\" and \"Fixed Assets\" records show amount 5,000,000, matching the invoice, but the \"Cash deposit\" entry only records 3,000,000.\n- So, the cash deposit record appears to have the wrong category (should be \"Bank deposit\") and wrong recorded amount (should be 5,000,000); these are internal inconsistencies.\n- The most reliable value (based on the invoice and the duplicated records) is \"Bank deposit\" and 5,000,000.0.\n- All other fields are blank in both, so nothing else is estimated.\n\nIf there are other IDs in your sample you want me to analyze, please specify. But for `id = Initial20231231001`, the above is the main internal inconsistency between the entries.",
