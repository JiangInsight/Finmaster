The rest of the fields align with the strictly summed invoice numbers/quantities.\n\nIf you wish to highlight other transactions with obvious inconsistencies (e.g., mismatched amounts or prices), please clarifyâ€”those would require comparing \"recorded_amount\" to \"recorded_quantity * recorded_unit_price\" and cross-checking invoice texts for discrepancies.\n\n**No other strong internal inconsistencies are visible (e.g., negative interest amounts, mismatches between units/prices/totals) for this subset except the examples you already quoted in your prompt.**\n\nIf you spot a specific transaction with a field mismatch (e.g., amount, payment method, etc.), please provide more detail. Otherwise, the format above can be used for any additional such findings.",
