This is an inconsistency.\n- The invoice states the amount is $37,305.85, but the `recorded_amount` is $40,952.58.\n- The invoice implies the sale unit price was $37,305.85, but the `recorded_unit_price` is $40,581.55.\n- Both the `recorded_type` and monetary amounts/price do not match the most reliable (invoice) field, so the best estimate for the correct values is what's on the invoice:\n  - Type: Sale\n  - Amount: 37,305.85\n  - Price: 37,305.85\n\nOther fields in the row, such as category and price, support that the invoice data is correct. No other inconsistencies are found among the rest of the transactions based on the pattern from the invoice.",
