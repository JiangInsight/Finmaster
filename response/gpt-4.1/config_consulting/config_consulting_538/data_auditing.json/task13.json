Thus, \"Recorded category\" is \"Administrative Expenses\" but the \"Original category\" is \"Sale\".\n\n2. **Tax**: The invoice says: \"cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $2742.68, leading to a total amount due of $52110.89\", but the field recorded_tax_amount is \"54982.96\" (way too high, and is even more than the full transaction, most likely a mis-record). So \"Recorded tax\" is \"54982.96\" and the best estimate for original tax is \"2742.68\".\n\n3. **Other fields**: The rest of the numeric fields (amount, quantity, price, etc.) all align with the invoice. The receive_method aligns (cash, as does the payment status \"Paid\"). The cost and profit as recorded are consistent, so not a data inconsistency to highlight.\n\n4. **Preparer/Approver**: Not mentioned in invoice, so left as null.\n\n**If you want similar reports about other rows in the input, let me know.**",
