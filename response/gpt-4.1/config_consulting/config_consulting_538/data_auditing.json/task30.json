The invoice says, \"unit price of $39275.99, totaling $39275.99\".\n    - The recorded tax is 41399.1, but the invoice says, \"tax amount of $1963.80\".\n    - The after-tax amount in the row (37312.19) is even less than amount, which doesn't add up with the invoice logic.\n    - Original category should be \"Sale\", original price should be 39275.99, original amount 39275.99, original tax 1963.8.\n\n_All other rows appear consistent in terms of core numeric fields and type per the invoice narrative, so only this row is clearly internally inconsistent in this batch._",
