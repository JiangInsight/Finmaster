For **Purchase20231231019**, the invoice field states: \"This transaction was prepared by Staff, and the approver is Director.\"  \n   But the row has an empty 'recorded_preparer' field. Therefore:\n   - There is an inconsistency between the original Preparer ('Staff') and the recorded one (empty/null).\n   - Output the inconsistency for Preparer as in the required format.\n\n2. All other entries (including examples explicitly checked) do not show mismatches between the invoice field and the recorded fields for category/type, amount, payment/receipt status, payment method, quantity, price, receive method, preparer, or approver.\n\n- Other fields such as recorded_type, recorded_amount, payment method/status, quantity, etc., are consistent with their descriptions in the invoice field in the provided examples, so they do not trigger inconsistency reports.\n- The same method applies for the rest of the data, but for brevity in the result sample above, I only listed the inconsistency found (for Purchase20231231019).\n\nIf you want the solution to only include true inconsistencies (not re-stating consistent rows), then the only output for this data is the following:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Original category\": \"\",\n  \"Recorded category\": \"\",\n  \"Original date\": \"\",\n  \"Recorded date\": \"\",\n  \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"\",\n  \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"\",\n  \"Original payment_method\": \"\",\n  \"Recorded payment_method\": \"\",\n  \"Original quantity\": \"\",\n  \"Recorded quantity\": \"\",\n  \"Original price\": \"\",\n  \"Recorded price\": \"\",\n  \"Original receive_method\": \"\",\n  \"Recorded receive_method\": \"\",\n  \"Original amount\": \"\",\n  \"Recorded amount\": \"\",\n  \"Original tax\": \"\",\n  \"Recorded tax\": \"\",\n  \"Original profit\": \"\",\n  \"Recorded profit\": \"\",\n  \"Original Preparer\": \"Staff\",\n  \"Recorded Preparer\": \"\",\n  \"Original Approver\": \"\",\n  \"Recorded Approver\": \"\",\n  \"id\": \"Purchase20231231019\"\n}}\n```\n\n**Summary of error:**  \n- **Purchase20231231019**: The 'preparer' as per invoice is \"Staff\", but the recorded 'preparer' is empty. This is the internal inconsistency identified in this block.\n",
