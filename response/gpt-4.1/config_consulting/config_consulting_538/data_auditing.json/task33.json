The cost amount for this transaction was $1000.00, with a tax amount of $118.25, leading to a total amount due of $2246.78. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n\n- The **recorded fields in the row** show:  \n  - recorded_type: \"Administrative Expenses\" (should be \"Sale\")  \n  - recorded_date: \"2024-01-23\" (should be \"2024-01-17\")  \n  - recorded_amount: 2515.64 (should be 2365.03)  \n  - recorded_product_name: \"Basic Consulting\" (matches invoice)  \n  - recorded_quantity: 1.0 (matches)  \n  - recorded_unit_price: 2661.69 (should be 2365.03)  \n  - recorded_tax_amount: \"1992.29\" (should be 118.25 per invoice)  \n  - Other fields generally agree, or are as blank as suggested by the invoice/surroundings.\n\n- The row was likely entered in the wrong account/ledger/type, on the wrong date, with the wrong amounts. Using the invoice as the reliable source, the correct values are as above.\n",
