Initial20231231001:**\n- There are three entries for the same ID, each with a different \"recorded_type\": Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets.\n- The \"invoice\" for each line refers to that specific type and its \"recorded_amount\", matching the line.\n- However, having three different types under one transaction ID is likely inconsistent; a well-formed accounting record should not assign multiple fundamentally different transaction types to the same ID.\n- Correct value likely: **Split into separate transactions, each with a unique ID, one for each type.**\n\n**2. Sale20240106008:**\n- Invoice: \"consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $10,930.08, totaling $10,930.08\" and is marked Paid by Cash, with associated cost, profit, and after-tax amounts matching that sales quantity and price.\n- Recorded_quantity: \"0.0\" (but unit price is filled in as 10,930.08, and all other amounts match 1×unit price).\n- Recorded_amount: \"0.0\" (but all other computed fields and the invoice show 1.0×$10,930.08).\n- This is a clear inconsistency—probably a data entry error.\n- **Correct value: quantity should be 1.0, amount should be 10,930.08, payment_method should be Cash.**\n\n---\n\nNo other obvious row-by-row inconsistencies exist where the invoice and the recorded fields disagree—aside from the above, fields are either blank or match the narrative in the invoice. If you need a combined/flattened view (one output per error, not per row with one row per error), the above suffices for all issues in this set.",
