The cost amount for this transaction was $1000.00, with a tax amount of $118.25, leading to a total amount due of $2246.78. The receive_method ... was account receivable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n- However, the \"recorded\" entry has:\n    - recorded_type = \"Administrative Expenses\" (should be \"Sale\")\n    - recorded_date = \"2024-02-15\" (should be \"2024-01-17\")\n    - recorded_amount = 2826.32 (should be 2365.03)\n    - But quantity, cost, cost amount, etc., otherwise match the pattern (tax, profit, etc. as in invoice)\n- Therefore, the inconsistencies are mainly in category, date, and amount.\n- The corrections are made based on the more reliable invoice description.\n```",
