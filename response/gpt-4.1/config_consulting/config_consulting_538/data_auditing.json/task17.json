The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $2392.26, leading to a total amount due of $45452.98. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n- The recorded fields show \"recorded_type\" as \"Administrative Expenses\" and \"recorded_receive_method\" as \"Cash\". These contradict the invoice.\n- The true (original) entry—per invoice—is a Sale, not Administrative Expenses. The receive method per invoice is \"Account Receviable\", not Cash.\n- All other fields (date, amount, etc.) remain, but only these two categorical fields are provably inconsistent.\n",
