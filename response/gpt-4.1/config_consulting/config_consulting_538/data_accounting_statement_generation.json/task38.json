What do we need to calculate?\n\nThe cash flow statement item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is calculated as:\n\n**Ending accounts receivable - Beginning accounts receivable**\n\nBut the sign is reversed!  \n- If Accounts Receivable increased, the change is **negative** in the cash flow statement (cash outflow).  \n- If decreased, it is **positive** (cash inflow).\n\nWe need:\n- Accounts Receivable at the start (2023-12-31)\n- Accounts Receivable at the end (2024-02-05)\n\nLet's reconstruct both.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What is the opening Accounts Receivable?\n\n### Check for opening balance as of 2023-12-31\n\nIn the given data, all \"Initial\" lines are for cash, bank, or fixed assets. No mention of opening AR.\n\nTherefore, **we assume the opening Accounts Receivable is zero**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Calculate the Accounts Receivable at the end (2024-02-05)\n\nThis means, **sum all sales recognized as Account Receivable, and subtract any receipts on those AR**.\n\nLook for all \"Sale\" transactions where payment/receipt_status indicates \"Account Receviable\" or \"Unpaid\", and which have not been paid by the end.\n\nBut in this data, only \"Sale\" transactions with \"Account Receviable\" are relevant (since 'Unpaid' is always ARâ€”in this data set).  \nAlso, no payments into AR are shown, so all AR from sales remain in AR.\n\nThus, **sum of all sales where receive_method is \"Account Receviable\" or payment/receipt_status is \"Unpaid\"**.\n\n### Let's check which field indicates AR\n\n- Column \"receive_method\": if \"Account Receviable\", for others is blank.\n- Column \"payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\" (i.e. not received). Some sales have \"Unpaid\" with \"Account Receviable\", some with blank receive_method.\n\nFrom the sample, seems \"Unpaid\" always means AR (since cash sales are 'Paid').\n\nSo, **sum \"amount\" of all \"Sale\" rows where payment/receipt_status==\"Unpaid\"**.\n\n---\n\n### List all \"Sale\" rows with payment/receipt_status==\"Unpaid\"\n\nLet's extract each sale with \"Unpaid\":\n\n#### (1) 2024-01-02\n- 187276.53 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 38382.28 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### (2) 2024-01-03\n- 49544.93 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 42123.04 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### (3) 2024-01-06\n- 13508.51 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 13808.73 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### (4) 2024-01-08\n- 12664.83 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### (5) 2024-01-11\n- 46958.27 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 256579.57 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### (6) 2024-01-12\n- 12805.9 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 39275.99 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### (7) 2024-01-13\n- 2751.44 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 9553.3 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### (8) 2024-01-15\n- 2447.22 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 10343.58 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 250134.77 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### (9) 2024-01-16\n- 2896.29 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 230916.68 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### (10) 2024-01-17\n- 13668.24 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 2365.03 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### (11) 2024-01-19\n- 58258.83 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### (12) 2024-01-20\n- 2786.73 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 9561.59 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 2601.16 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### (13) 2024-01-21\n- 47845.24 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### (14) 2024-01-22\n- 41223.6 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 14606.32 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### (15) 2024-01-24\n- 37337.81 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 2564.48 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### (16) 2024-01-27\n- 9456.44 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 46394.84 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 52715.73 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### (17) 2024-01-29\n- 2189.34 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### (18) 2024-01-30\n- 11773.03 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### (19) 2024-01-31\n- 59090.75 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 12661.47 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### (20) 2024-02-01\n- 2641.22 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n- 52763.36 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### (21) 2024-02-04\n- 9931.23 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\n#### (22) 2024-02-05\n- 2502.87 (Unpaid, Account Receviable)\n\nNow sum all these up.\n\n---\n\n## 4.
