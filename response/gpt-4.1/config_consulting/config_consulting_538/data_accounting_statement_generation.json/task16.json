                        "content": "Let's solve this step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Understand Paid-in Capital\n\n**Paid-in capital** refers to the equity contributed by owners/investors to the company, often at the inception of the business or via subsequent increases in capital. It is generally reflected by *deposits of cash, assets, or other contributions by shareholders/owners*, not by operational revenues (like sales) or expenses, operational purchases, etc.\n\n- So, only transactions under the type \"Initial\" (or anything similar like future capital increases) directly affect Paid-in Capital.\n- Purchases, sales, expenses, interest, and depreciation **do not** affect paid-in capital.\n\n## Step 2: Identify Paid-in Capital Transactions\n\nLooking through the data for transactions related to Initial Capital (typically labeled as \"Initial...\"):\n\n### Transactions:\n| id                | type           | date       | amount      | \n|-------------------|----------------|------------|-------------|\n| Initial20231231001| Cash deposit   |2023-12-31  | 3,000,000.0 |\n| Initial20231231001| Bank deposit   |2023-12-31  | 5,000,000.0 |\n| Initial20231231001| Fixed Assets   |2023-12-31  | 5,000,000.0 |\n\nALL other transactions are either purchases, expenses, depreciation, interest, or sales -- none of these are additional paid-in capital.\n\n**Total Paid-in Capital at the Start:**\n3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = **13,000,000.00**\n\n## Step 3: Is There Any Change?\n\n- Check if there is any *further capital injection (new paid-in capital)* at any later date (e.g., another \"Initial\" with a new id, or \"Capital Increase\", etc). **There are none.**\n- There are NO capital withdrawals explicitly (if there were, you would see something like a negative capital movement or withdrawal of capital, which isn't present).\n- Therefore, *the paid-in capital did not change* during the period.\n\n## Step 4: Solution Formatting\n\nPresent the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'} }\n```\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
