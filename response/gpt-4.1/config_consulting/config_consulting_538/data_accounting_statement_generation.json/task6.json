What are Current Assets?\n**Current Assets** are assets expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within a year. This includes:\n- Cash and bank deposits\n- Accounts receivable\n- Interest receivable\n- Inventory (not applicable here as all products are consulting/services)\n- Other short-term receivables\n\n**Fixed assets** (e.g., \"Fixed Assets\" line) are NOT current assets.\n\nPurchases are typically for inventory – but in this scenario (consulting/services) there is **no inventory**, so purchases likely become expenses and don't add to current assets directly.\n\nExpenses (administrative, sales, financial) reduce cash.\n\n## 2. Identify the Initial Value of Current Assets\n\nFrom the first few lines:\n- `Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | amount: 3,000,000`\n- `Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | amount: 5,000,000`\n- `Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | amount: 5,000,000` (Not a current asset)\n\n**So the initial current assets:**  \n= Cash + Bank  \n= 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = **8,000,000**\n\n## 3. What affects Current Assets through the period?\n\n### ADD\n- Purchases/Sales *on credit* → Increase accounts receivable\n- Interest Receivable booked but not yet paid → Increase interest receivable\n- Sales *paid in cash* → Increases cash\n\n### SUBTRACT\n- Paid Expenses (cash or bank) → Decrease cash/bank\n- Purchases *paid* → Decrease cash/bank\n- Credit purchases (unpaid): do **not** affect current assets immediately.\n- Depreciation: does **not** affect current assets (is a non-cash, non-current item).\n- Interest receivable accrued: increases current assets (when accrued), paid: converts to cash (so a transfer between current asset accounts).\n- Payments to suppliers *(purchases paid immediately)* minus purchases unpaid\n\nNote: If a sale is on credit (accounts receivable), that increases current assets (accounts receivable), and when collected, it increases cash and reduces AR, so net current assets not changed by collection.\n\nSimilarly, purchases on account (unpaid) increase inventory receivable; but here with no inventory carried, purchases do not contribute current assets.\n\n### Key Asset Accounts to Track\n- Cash/Bank\n- Accounts Receivable\n- Interest Receivable\n\n## 4. The Process\n\nLet's start with initial balances:\n\n### Step 4.1: Initial\n- **Cash:** 3,000,000\n- **Bank:** 5,000,000\n----------------------------------\n- **Total:** 8,000,000\n\n### Step 4.2: Go through period transactions (JAN 1 - FEB 5)\nWe need to:\n- Track changes to **cash**\n- Track changes to **bank**\n- Track **accounts receivable** balance (sum of all credit sales less collections, but in these records, cash received is always immediately posted)\n- Track **interest receivable** (sum of all Interest Receivable entries for current period, as unpaid; since none of these lines are \"Paid,\" they're all AR at period end)\n\n#### Let's go component by component.\n\n### A. Cash and Bank Calculation\n\nLet's create our base:\n\n**STARTING CASH & BANK:**  \n- Cash: 3,000,000  \n- Bank: 5,000,000  \n\n#### 1.
