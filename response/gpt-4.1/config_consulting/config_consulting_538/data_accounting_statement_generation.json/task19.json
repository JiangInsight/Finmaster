For initial, only the capital (\"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\") is entered.\n\nFrom the \"problem\":\n\n| type           | amount      |\n| -------------- | ----------- |\n| Cash deposit   | 3,000,000   |\n| Bank deposit   | 5,000,000   |\n| Fixed Assets   | 5,000,000   |\n\nThere are no liabilities or retained earnings listed at this moment; all is owner's equity/capital. Ignore purchases, as they are not initial balances but part of operations (unless marked as opening balances, which these are not).\n\n**Total Initial Liabilities + Owner's Equity = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000**\n\n---\n\n## 2. **End Value:**\nAt the end, total Liabilities and Owner's Equity = Total Assets.\nSo we must sum all asset balances at the end of the period AS IF preparing a balance sheet: \n  - Cash\n  - Bank\n  - Accounts Receivable\n  - Interest Receivable\n  - Fixed Assets (net)\n  - (ignore inventory, as not applicable here; purchases are services)\n  \nWe must also add up all Liabilities (mainly Accounts Payable) and Owner’s Equity (Initial Capital + Retained Earnings/Profit/Loss).\n\nBut since **Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity** and we have all details as transactions, we can **calculate the asset side** (as is standard in this type of question).\n\nLet's sum each asset category at end of period. We'll also tally Liabilities (Accounts Payable) to check.\n\n---\n\n### A. **Cash & Bank Calculation**\n\n1. **Opening:**\n   - Cash: 3,000,000\n   - Bank: 5,000,000\n\n2. **Cash/Bank receipts and payments:** Let's process in/outflows (first as cash + bank together; transfers are between them, so don't affect aggregate total).\n\n#### **Receipts** (IN)\n\nAll sales marked \"Paid\" are received (in cash/bank depending on method, but for total assets it doesn't matter).\n\n**Sum of all 'Paid' sales:**\n\nFrom the data, filter `type = Sale` and `payment/receipt_status` = Paid.\n\nExtract all such Sale entries (I will total below):\n\n| date       | amount     |\n|------------|------------|\n| 2024-01-06 | 10,930.08  |\n| 2024-01-08 | 54,853.57  |\n| 2024-01-09 |199,566.18  |\n| 2024-01-10 | 11,979.62  |\n| 2024-01-11 | 40,755.74  |\n| 2024-01-12 | 13,993.88  |\n| 2024-01-13 |209,370.21  |\n| 2024-01-14 |294,208.59  |\n| 2024-01-18 | 37,305.85  |\n| 2024-01-26 |246,615.65  |\n| 2024-01-27 |  2,295.46  |\n| 2024-01-30 |  2,881.68  |\n| 2024-02-01 |246,615.65  |\n| 2024-02-03 |183,770.14  |\n\nBut that's not all, I need to check every Sale with Paid status.\n\nLet's go through the big list of Sales:\n\n**Scanning (copy-paste of the Sale rows):**\n- Sale20240106008 | Sale | 2024-01-06 | 2024-01-06 | 10,930.08 | ... | Paid | | 5,000.0\n- Sale20240108013 | Sale | 2024-01-08 | 54,853.57 | ... | Paid | | 20,000.0\n- Sale20240109016 | 199,566.18 | Paid\n- Sale20240110019 | 11,979.62 | Paid\n- Sale20240111021 | 40,755.74 | Paid\n- Sale20240112027 | 13,993.88 | Paid\n- Sale20240113029 |209,370.21 | Paid\n- Sale20240114033 |294,208.59 | Paid\n- Sale20240118046 | 37,305.85 | Paid\n- Sale20240128067 |  2,295.46 | Paid\n- Sale20240130072 |  2,881.68 | Paid\n- Sale20240131075 | 59,090.75 | Paid\n- Sale20240203081 |246,615.65 | Paid\n- Sale20240205085 |183,770.14 | Paid\n\n**Let's sum:**\n\n- 10,930.08\n- 54,853.57\n-199,566.18\n- 11,979.62\n- 40,755.74\n- 13,993.88\n-209,370.21\n-294,208.59\n- 37,305.85\n-  2,295.46\n-  2,881.68\n- 59,090.75\n-246,615.65\n-183,770.14\n\n**Stepwise addition:**\n\n- 10,930.08  \n+ 54,853.57 = 65,783.65  \n+199,566.18 =265,349.83  \n+ 11,979.62 =277,329.45  \n+ 40,755.74 =318,085.19  \n+ 13,993.88 =332,079.07  \n+209,370.21 =541,449.28  \n+294,208.59 =835,657.87  \n+ 37,305.85 =872,963.72  \n+  2,295.46 =875,259.18  \n+  2,881.68 =878,140.86  \n+ 59,090.75 =937,231.61  \n+246,615.65 =1,183,847.26  \n+183,770.14 =1,367,617.40\n\nThus, **Total Paid Sales = 1,367,617.40**\n\n---\n\n#### **Payments (OUT):**\n\nNow sum all payments made for purchases and expenses: (We ignore transfers between cash/bank as they don't change assets in total.)\n\nFirst, **Purchases** that are Paid:\n\nFrom the data, filter `type = Purchase` and `payment/receipt_status` = Paid.\n\nList all:\n\n- Purchase20231231001, Paid, 100,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231002, Paid, 60,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231003, Paid, 15,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231004, Paid, 100,000 (Cash)\n- Purchase20231231005, Paid, 100,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231007, Paid, 5,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231008, Paid, 40,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231009, Paid, 15,000 (Cash)\n- Purchase20231231010, Paid, 10,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231011, Paid, 10,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231012, Paid, 40,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231015, Paid, 3,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231016, Paid, 2,000 (Cash)\n- Purchase20231231017, Paid, 40,000 (Cash)\n- Purchase20231231019, Paid, 2,000 (Cash)\n- Purchase20231231020, Paid, 3,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231021, Paid, 40,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231022, Paid, 10,000 (Cash)\n- Purchase20231231023, Paid, 40,000 (Cash)\n- Purchase20231231027, Paid, 40,000 (Cash)\n- Purchase20231231028, Paid, 3,000 (Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231030, Paid, 2,000 (Bank Transfer)\n\nLet's sum the **Paid Purchases**:\n\n100,000  \n+ 60,000 = 160,000  \n+ 15,000 = 175,000  \n+100,000 = 275,000   \n+100,000 = 375,000  \n+  5,000 = 380,000  \n+ 40,000 = 420,000  \n+ 15,000 = 435,000  \n+ 10,000 = 445,000  \n+ 10,000 = 455,000  \n+ 40,000 = 495,000  \n+  3,000 = 498,000  \n+  2,000 = 500,000  \n+ 40,000 = 540,000  \n+  2,000 = 542,000  \n+  3,000 = 545,000  \n+ 40,000 = 585,000  \n+ 10,000 = 595,000  \n+ 40,000 = 635,000  \n+ 40,000 = 675,000  \n+  3,000 = 678,000  \n+  2,000 = 680,000  \n\n**Total Paid Purchases: 680,000**\n\n---\n\nNext, **All Paid Expenses**: (Administrative, Sales, Financial)\n\nAll such expenses have \"Paid\" status, sum all the \"amount\" fields.\n\nThere are many, so efficient way is to sum all rows where type includes \"Expense\" and payment/receipt_status = Paid.\n\n**Quick Calculation -
