                        "content": "Let's proceed step by step:\n\n### 1. Identify Non-Current Asset Items\n\nNon-current assets typically include:  \n- Fixed assets (e.g. \"Fixed Assets\" initial deposit)\n- Intangible assets (sometimes: software, patents, but not mentioned here)\n- Long-term investments (not in the data)\n- Construction in progress (not in the data)\n\nBased on the table, the only non-current asset clearly present is **\"Fixed Assets\"**. All other purchases (Enterprise Solution, Premium Consulting, Standard Consulting, Basic Consulting) appear to be either services/consulting/software (possibly expensed immediately or treated as inventory/current asset), not categorized as non-current in this context unless specifically designated \"Fixed Assets\".\n\n### 2. Find Initial Value for Non-Current Assets\n\nFrom the table:\n| id                   | type         | amount   |\n|----------------------|--------------|----------|\n| Initial20231231001   | Fixed Assets | 5000000.0|\n\n**Initial Non-current Assets = 5,000,000.00**\n\n\n### 3. Identify Additions/Purchases of Non-Current Assets during the Period\n\n- No additional \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" specifically shown (none like in the example data called e.g. \"FixedAsset20231231001\"). \n- All \"Purchase\" entries are for consulting/services/solutions, which are not explicitly called \"Fixed Assets\".\n\n**Assumption:** Unless specifically marked as \"Fixed Assets\" (like in initial balance), do NOT add these as non-current assets.\n\n### 4. Calculate Depreciation\n\nDepreciation entries:\n- Depreciation20240101001 | 45752.22\n- Depreciation20240201002 | 45750.84\n\nTotal depreciation for period:  \n45752.22 + 45750.84 = **91,503.06**\n\n### 5. Dispose/Adjustments\n\nNo fixed assets sold/disposed reported. So no disposals.\n\n### 6. Calculate Closing/Final Value\n\n**Formula:**  \nFinal Non-current Assets = Initial Value  \n+ Purchases (if any)  \n- Depreciation  \n- Disposals (if any)\n\nFrom above:\n- Initial = 5,000,000.00\n- Purchases = 0.00\n- Depreciation = 91,503.06\n- Disposals = 0.00\n\n**End Value = 5,000,000.00 - 91,503.06 = 4,908,496.94**\n\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer in Required JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"4908496.94\"} }\n```\n",
