Accounts Payable Initial Value\n\n- From the data, initial accounts (the first few rows) are only deposits and fixed assets; **no accounts payable on 2023-12-31 in the initial balances**.\n- **Accounts Payable Initial Value = 0.00**\n\n## 2. Accounts Payable End Value\n\nAccounts Payable is a liability account reflecting **amounts owed to suppliers for purchases made on credit** (Unpaid).\n\n**We need to:**\n- Sum up all \"Purchase\" type entries where `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\" (i.e., Account Payable).\n- Ignore entries where purchases have already been paid (i.e., paid via bank transfer/cash) or do not relate to accounts payable.\n- The relevant field is `amount` in such transactions.\n- Only non-zero, not-yet-paid purchases increase accounts payable.\n\nLet's extract all such \"Unpaid\" purchases (filtering on the `Purchase` type and `Unpaid/Account Payable`):\n\n### Scanning the dataset for Unpaid Purchases\nLet's list them:\n| id                      | type      | amount   | payment/receipt_status | supplier_id |\n|-------------------------|-----------|----------|-----------------------|-------------|\n| Purchase20231231006     | Purchase  | 100000.0 | Unpaid                | S005        |\n| Purchase20231231010     | Purchase  | 300000.0 | Unpaid                | S005        |\n| Purchase20231231013     | Purchase  | 1000.0   | Unpaid                | S007        |\n| Purchase20231231014     | Purchase  | 15000.0  | Unpaid                | S004        |\n| Purchase20231231018     | Purchase  | 60000.0  | Unpaid                | S009        |\n| Purchase20231231024     | Purchase  | 20000.0  | Unpaid                | S006        |\n| Purchase20231231025     | Purchase  | 5000.0   | Unpaid                | S009        |\n| Purchase20231231026     | Purchase  | 300000.0 | Unpaid                | S008        |\n| Purchase20231231029     | Purchase  | 15000.0  | Unpaid                | S006        |\n\nNow sum the amounts:\n\n- 100,000\n- 300,000\n- 1,000\n- 15,000\n- 60,000\n- 20,000\n- 5,000\n- 300,000\n- 15,000\n\n**Sum:**  \n100,000 + 300,000 = 400,000  \n+ 1,000 = 401,000  \n+ 15,000 = 416,000  \n+ 60,000 = 476,000  \n+ 20,000 = 496,000  \n+ 5,000 = 501,000  \n+ 300,000 = 801,000  \n+ 15,000 = 816,000  \n\n**Total Unpaid Purchases = 816,000.00**\n\n## Double Check: Have any of these been paid during the period?\n\nLet's look for any payment entries (non-purchase) that reference specifically paying off payables. In this dataset, there is **no indication of subsequent payments to accounts payable for these purchase entries** (no \"Payment to Supplier\" or similar).\n\n## **Solution in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"816000.00\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"816000.00\"} }\n```",
