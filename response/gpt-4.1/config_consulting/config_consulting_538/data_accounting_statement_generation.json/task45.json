Definition:**  \nNet Cash Flow from Investing Activities includes cash paid (outflow) or received (inflow) for the purchase or sale of long-term assets such as **fixed assets**, intangible assets, and investments.\n\n**2. Identify Investing Activity Transactions:**\n- Look for transactions indicating acquisition or disposal of fixed assets (not normal operating purchases/services or expenses!).\n\n**3. Scan Provided Data:**\n- Only one investing activity is present:\n  - **Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0**\n    - This is a cash outflow for purchasing fixed assets.\n\n**4. Other Purchases:**\n- All other \"Purchase\" transactions are for services/consulting (see the column product_name and supplier_name), not assets.\n\n**5. Disposal/Sale of Assets?**\n- No transaction of type \"Sale\" for fixed assets, only operational sales.\n\n**6. Accumulated Depreciation:**\n- Depreciation is a non-cash expense; it does not factor into cash flow (it's used in \"Indirect Method\" to adjust net profit, not as investing outflow).\n\n**7. Conclusion:**\nTotal investing cash flow = **Outflow for Fixed Asset Purchase only = -5,000,000.0**\n\n**Therefore:**\n- **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities** = **-5,000,000.0**",
