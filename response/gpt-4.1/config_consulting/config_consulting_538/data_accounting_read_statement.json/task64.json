This is \"Paid-in Capital\" on the Balance Sheet => **13000000.00**\n- value2: End value of profit or loss before tax expense. This is \"Profit Before Tax\" on the Income Statement => **1114535.06**\n- value3: Addition in amount owed for goods/services received or purchased on credit during the period. This is the \"Accounts Payable\" increase, taken from the *Ending* \"Accounts Payable\" on the Balance Sheet (since it was zero at the initial date, the addition equals the end value) or the line \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" on the Cash Flow Statement (both show 816000.00) => **816000.00**",
