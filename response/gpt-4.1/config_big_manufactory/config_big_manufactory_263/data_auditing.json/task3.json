Since this is an opening balance, it's typical to split equity into cash, bank, and fixed assets, and the invoice reflects three different amounts summing up (5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 28,000,000). Given only the invoice (which matches the amount), no field is internally inconsistent per row, so no correction within the row itself. Thus, no per-row inconsistency for these first three, but it shows splitting of the initial capital, not a real error; still, for completeness, they're listed here to show standardization.\n\n- For id=`Expense20240131001`, the invoice clearly states payment \"was paid\", but recorded_payment/receipt_status is \"Unpaid\" â€” this is an actual inconsistency. The correct status should be \"Paid\".\n\n- All other rows checked have correct matching between the invoice and structured data (e.g., purchase prices match between unit x qty = amount, supervisor/staff/approver, payment methods, statuses, etc.), and typical interest/profit/tax correspond. \n\n- Only substantive internal error is on `Expense20240131001` payment status. No other inconsistencies (such as amount, payment status, quantities, prices, preparer/approver, or category) found.\n",
