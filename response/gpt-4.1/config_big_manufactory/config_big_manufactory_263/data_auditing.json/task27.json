Without splitting rationale or sum total, these records represent a grouping inconsistency.\n\n2. **Sale20240115009:**\n   - The invoice and the record do not match.\n   - The record shows `recorded_type = \"Depreciation\"`, but the invoice and other fields (product, customer, etc.) indicate it should be a \"Sale\" entry.\n   - The recorded amount (2452854.93) and recorded unit price (2239989.62) do not match the sale description in the invoice, which says 1 unit at 2106067.17 (amount should thus be 2106067.17).\n   - Cost amount, tax, quantity, receive_method, all match the invoice text, supporting the invoice as the reliable source.\n   - Thus, correct values should be: Category \"Sale\", amount 2106067.17, unit price 2106067.17 (from invoice, since quantity is 1.0).\n   - The 'Depreciation' entry is a misrecord.\n\n**Other records analyzed and found no field-level inconsistencies so stark as in above (no mismatches between record and invoice for amount/unit price/type/date, etc).**\n\nIf you would like only the detected errors or would like all fields filled (with nulls for NA), let me know!",
