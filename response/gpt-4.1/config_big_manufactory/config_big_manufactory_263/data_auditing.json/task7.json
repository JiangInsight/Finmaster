The amounts add up to 28,000,000. Based on accounting practice, the initial capital entry should sum up to the actual capital introduced. There is no explicit arithmetic or internal amount inconsistency in the row, but it's notable that separate entries form one actual event. Providing their sum for clarity.\n\n2. **Sale20240115009**: The invoice and entry fields indicate a *\"Receive Method\"* of \"Interest receivable\", but the invoice/transaction description refers to \"account receviable\" (should be \"Account Receivable\"). Thus, the inconsistency is between the recorded field and the supporting documentation. The correct value should be \"Account Receivable\".\n\nOther entries are internally consistent or have no evidence of an internal mismatch based on invoice/description and row values.\n\n**Note:** Only rows with evident inconsistencies extracted per instructions. If requested, the report can be expanded to highlight other potential logical issues (e.g., missing values), but only strict internal inconsistencies/core field mismatches are reported as specified.",
