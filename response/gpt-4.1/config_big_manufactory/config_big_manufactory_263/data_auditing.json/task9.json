Other fields match the detail in the invoice sentence; quantities, unit prices, costs, and other fields are consistent or missing (not a contradiction).\n\n**Other notes:**\n- This is consistent with the Example you provided and the row's own “risk_issues” field.\n- The solution format (as per your instructions) only details the error.\n\n---\n\nIf you need all errors for the entire table, let me know, but this is the only clear internal contradiction in the sample you gave.",
