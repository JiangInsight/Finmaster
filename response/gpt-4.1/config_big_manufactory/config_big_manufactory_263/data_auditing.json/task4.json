This should be split, not duplicated or exaggerated.\n   - So, inconsistency is in the 'amount' and 'recorded_type': the total initial capital should be correctly splitâ€”likely $15M bank + $5M cash + $8M fixed assets = $28M, unless some is duplicated.\n\n2. **Expense20240125001**:\n   - 'Recorded_payment_method' is 'Bank Transfer', but invoice narration and all other similar expense entries use 'Cash'.\n   - All other lines for this expense batch, and the invoice narration, use 'Cash' as payment method.\n   - Therefore, the correct payment method should be 'Cash'.\n   - This matches Example's format (example for error in payment_method field).\n\nNo major field discrepancies with price/quantity/amount/invoice in other entries. All purchase and sale entries have matching product, unit price, quantity, and amount as per invoice. All interest entries match narration.\n\n**Only these two internal inconsistencies were found:**\n- One is about the correct split of initial capital (could result from entry duplication/misclassification or misunderstanding underlying records).\n- The other is about a mis-recorded payment_method (Bank Transfer vs. Cash) for a single expense entry.\n\nIf you would like me to use a different output logic (such as more granular breakdown for the Initial entry, or if you only want payment method errors), let me know!",
