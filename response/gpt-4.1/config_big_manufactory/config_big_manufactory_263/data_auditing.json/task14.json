The invoices all reference distinct values matching their type. The more reliable source is the invoice field, so the presence of three different records with the same ID for very different things is internally inconsistent. In each, the \"recorded_category\" and \"recorded_amount\" is mismatched for what should be a unique transaction ID; amounts and categories are mixed up. Each is reported as an error with the best estimate based on other fields.\n\n2. **Sale20240104001 Inconsistency**: The sale invoice says 1 unit sold at $1,041,848.53 (total), cost = $800,000.00, tax = $52,092.43, and status \"unpaid\" (Account Receivable), but the row's own fields have quantity = 0, recorded_amount = 0.00, and payment/receipt_status = \"Paid\". According to the invoice (most reliable source), these fields should be: quantity=1, payment/receipt_status=\"Unpaid\", recorded_amount=1,041,848.53, etc. All those fields are therefore internally inconsistent and corrected in the output.\n\n3. Other rows show no internal inconsistencies, as all their field values match their respective invoice descriptions. \n\nIf there are further instances required, please clarify, but these are the main ones clearly identifiable from the presented data.",
