\"invoice\" field specifies: *\"consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $1,000,000.00, totaling $2,000,000.00\"*. The recorded fields state only 1.0 units and recorded_amount $1,000,000.00. This is an inconsistency. Correct quantity should be 2.0 and correct amount $2,000,000.00, matching invoice and other purchase entries.\n\n- Other entries do not show internal inconsistencies between their fields and their invoice lines (amount matches invoice, etc.). The rest of the fields are plausible and internally consistent.\n\n- Only real inconsistency: Purchase20231231005 â€“ quantity and amount incorrect. \n\n- Other fields for all transactions are either absent or consistent; no need to relist where there are no errors.\n\n**If you want only the erroneous entry in the output, specify and I can provide only that.**",
