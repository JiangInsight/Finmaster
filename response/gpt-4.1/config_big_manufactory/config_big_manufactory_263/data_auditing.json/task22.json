The \"recorded_amount\" fields in the corresponding rows should match the \"invoice\" description, and they do. There are no inconsistencies in values, but since all three entries have the same id with different categories (cash deposit, bank deposit, fixed assets), you might expect only one summary row; but as per invoice, all are correct individuallyâ€”no error, but an implicit warning that \"id\" is overloaded here (not a data mistake).\n\n- **For the row with id `Purchase20231231012`:**  \n  The invoice (and context of similar purchases in the data) states the unit price is $800,000.00 for 2 units, totaling $1,600,000.00. The recorded `recorded_unit_price` is wrongly shown as 677,096.28, which does not match the invoice and does not multiply to the total amount. The correct unit price should be 800,000. Also, the `recorded_date` is 2024-01-20, while the invoice and series date should be 2023-12-31.\n\nNo other rows have internal inconsistencies between the more reliable invoice and the fields in the row, or at least they match as expected. If you require only records with detected discrepancies, only the last object (id `Purchase20231231012`) would be included.",
