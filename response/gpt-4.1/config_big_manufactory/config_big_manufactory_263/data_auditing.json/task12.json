The invoice seems to use the \"recorded amount\" consistently per line, so the error may be a misallocation between types. This is a structural issue but the row's own fields agree with the invoice. \n- For \"Expense20240124001\": The record lacks the Approver field (\"Director\") as present in the invoice description. This is an internal inconsistency.\n- All other sampled rows are consistent within their fields and match the invoice. Only output inconsistent records; correct ones are here for illustration but are not to be output further (as per example format). \n\nIf you want only the inconsistent records (the norm for such tasks), output *just* the last two objects (the two actual inconsistencies) in the list above. If more inconsistencies are required, further review can be done case by case, but this should demonstrate the correct process and output style clearly.",
