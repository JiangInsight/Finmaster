Usually, cash+bank+fixed assets = equity, but the separate invoices, each for discrete amounts, is not standard.\n   - Recorded values are likely correct as far as the data is presented but are *potentially inconsistent as a group*.\n\n2. **Purchase and Sale profit errors**:\n   - The id `Sale20240119014` reports a profit in the 'recorded_profit' field as 524316.6 while the expected (invoice/calculation from amount-cost) is 700530.42, indicating a profit miscalculation (should be amount - cost_amount = 2200530.42 - 1500000 = 700530.42).\n   - This matches the risk issue already embedded in the sample, and as per the task, the invoice is considered most reliable, so the original profit should be 700530.42 not 524316.6.\n\n**No other clear per-row internal inconsistencies are found (unit price x quantity matches total, payment status and method match, etc.) in the sample. Only aggregate/structural (initial split ambiguity) and clear profit inconsistency for Sale20240119014.**\n\nIf you need *only* inconsistencies, then perhaps drop the initial capital entry, but it is included for completeness.\n\n**If you only want the profit error:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sale', 'Original date': '2024-01-19', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-19', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': '', 'Recorded payment_method': '', 'Original quantity': '1', 'Recorded quantity': '1', 'Original price': '2200530.42', 'Recorded price': '2200530.42', 'Original receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Original amount': '2200530.42', 'Recorded amount': '2200530.42', 'Original tax': '110026.52', 'Recorded tax': '110026.52', 'Original profit': '700530.42', 'Recorded profit': '524316.6', 'Original Preparer': '', 'Recorded Preparer': '', 'Original Approver': '', 'Recorded Approver': '', 'id': 'Sale20240119014'} }\n```\nLet me know if you want only this single-row error or any others expanded in detail.",
