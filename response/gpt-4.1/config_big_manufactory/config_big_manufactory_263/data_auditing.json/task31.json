E.g., the sum of cash deposit + bank deposit + fixed assets = 28,000,000 which is possibly the breakdown of the full initial capital. In this context, each entry by itself does not appear inconsistent, so no correction needed unless you expect the entries to sum rather than to be presented separately.\n- For \"Sale20240118012\", there are multiple issues:\n  - recorded_quantity is 0 but invoice narrative and other fields indicate it should be 1.\n  - recorded_unit_price doesn't match the number in the invoice/narrative (should be 1,105,445.95), but 1,182,606.84 is recorded.\n  - recorded_amount is 0.0 but invoice and calculation (unit_price * quantity = 1,105,445.95 * 1 = 1,105,445.95) implies it should be 1,105,445.95.\n  - recorded_tax_amount is wildly different from the invoice calculation.\n  - after-tax and profit are also impacted.\n- The review does not find clear internal inconsistencies in the other entries, as each one matches invoice, amount = quantity * unit price, etc.\n- The solution is presented for entries where the discrepancy exists.\n\nIf you have read this reasoning and wish to focus only on entries with clear inconsistency, only \"Sale20240118012\" would need flagging. If you want all amounts for \"Initial20231231001\" compared/consolidated, please clarify expectations.",
