All other values are consistent and valid according to the invoice. Thus, the correct amount should be 1328171.21.\n- All \"Interest Receivables\" and expense entries match the invoice and no inconsistencies were found based on provided data.\n\n**Only Sale20240125020 shows an internal inconsistency needing correction.** All others are consistent.",
