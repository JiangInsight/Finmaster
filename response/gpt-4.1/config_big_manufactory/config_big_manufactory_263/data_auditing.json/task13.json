Normally, a single transaction id corresponds to a single category; the \"invoice\" says it is an initial deposit transaction, but here three different asset subcategories are recorded. All are within the scope of initialization entries, so it's not a strict mismatch in amounts, but in accounting classification a unique id should not have three different \"recorded_type\". Therefore, the inconsistency is:  \n  - Several categories have been recorded under a single ID.\n  - The amounts recorded sum to more than 15,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 28,000,000.\n  - Most likely, original intent was to record asset sources for startup: capital injections into bank, cash, and fixed assets.\n  - The ids should have been unique if counted as different asset classes, or, the \"recorded_type\" should have matched a single id per entry.  \n\n   To make the fields explicit, but since the recorded values and invoice match, the main inconsistency is multiple asset types under a single id. The recorded amounts themselves match invoice and so are likely correct.\n\n2. **Sale20240108002:**  \n   - recorded_type is \"Administrative Expenses\" but the detailed invoice says \"On January 08, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale...\" and the other fields back this up (product id: P003, product_name: Heavy Equipment C, cost_amount, tax_amount, customer id, etc).\n   - recorded_tax_amount is 1,556,482.1, but the invoice states \"tax amount ... was $68,904.10\".\n   - The correct category is \"Sale\", not \"Administrative Expenses\".\n   - The correct tax is $68,904.10.\n\n3. **For all instances with consistent invoice/category/unit/amounts:**  \n   - The rest of the entries do not exhibit internal inconsistency, as quantities, unit prices, and totals line up; categories and descriptions match.\n\n**Final Note:**  \nIf you are seeking only the fields with errors, then only the multi-type initial entries under a single id, and the category/tax mismatch in Sale20240108002, are material issues.\n\nIf a more minimal JSON is required (listing *only* the erroneous field(s)), you may refer only to the entries with actual field mismatches, such as for Sale20240108002. If the task is to list *all* the initial id tri-entries (as a consistency concern), then include those as shown. You may drop unchanged fields for clarity, but the above matches the comprehensive instruction.",
