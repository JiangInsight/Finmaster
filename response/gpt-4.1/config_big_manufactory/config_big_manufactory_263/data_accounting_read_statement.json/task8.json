The initial value for \"Accounts Payable\" on 2023-12-31 is 0.00 and the end value on 2024-02-05 is also 0.00. No other line item (such as \"Taxes Payable\" or \"Total Current Liabilities\") exclusively represents trade payables for goods or servicesâ€”those are for taxes and all combined current liabilities, respectively. Therefore, both the initial and end values for amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit are zero.",
