Costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services (typically \"Selling Expenses\" or similar in the income statement).\n    2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, equipment, and other long-term assets (typically \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" or similar in the cash flow statement).\n\n**Step-by-step Extraction:**\n\n**From the Income Statement:**\n- \"Selling Expenses\" is listed as 963185.37. This fits as the cost to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services.\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is listed as 0.00, which means no cash outflow for property, plant, equipment, or other long-term assets in the current period.\n\nThus:\n- value1 (Selling Expenses) = 963185.37\n- value2 (Purchase of Fixed Assets) = 0.00",
