The task asks to identify and extract the specific line items and value of EXPENSE in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, using the balance sheet information, including initial and final value.\n\n2. On the balance sheet, the main direct connection to an expense (that is visible from the balance sheet alone) is typically \"Accumulated Depreciation\" (the cumulative depreciation expense recorded over time), as well as changes in \"Retained Earnings\" which reflect net profit/loss after all income and expenses (but not a direct expense line item).\n\n3. The sample solution identifies \"Accumulated Depreciation\" as the main expense line item, showing a movement from an initial amount (0.00) to an end value (45,751.41).\n\n4. In the provided \"problem\", \"Accumulated Depreciation\" goes:\n   - Initial: 0.00 (2023-12-31)\n   - End: 91498.88 (2024-02-05)\n\n5. This indicates that \"Depreciation Expense\" for the period is 91,498.88, and this is the implied expense for the \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item.\n\n6. Applying the required output format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '91498.88'} }\n```",
