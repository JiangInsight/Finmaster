Let's confirm:\n\n```\n| Purchase20231231001 | ... | Paid | Cash | ...\n| Purchase20231231002 | ... | Paid | Cash | ...\n| Purchase20231231003 | ... | Paid | Bank Transfer | ...\n| Purchase20231231004 | ... | Paid | Cash | ...\n| Purchase20231231005 | ... | Paid | Bank Transfer | ...\n| Purchase20231231006 | ... | Paid | Bank Transfer | ...\n| Purchase20231231007 | ... | Paid | Bank Transfer | ...\n| Purchase20231231008 | ... | Paid | Cash | ...\n| Purchase20231231009 | ... | Paid | Bank Transfer | ...\n| Purchase20231231010 | ... | Paid | Bank Transfer | ...\n| Purchase20231231011 | ... | Paid | Cash | ...\n| Purchase20231231012 | ... | Paid | Bank Transfer | ...\n| Purchase20231231013 | ... | Paid | Cash | ...\n```\n\nAll \"Purchase\" entries are marked as **Paid**. No \"Unpaid\" purchases.\n\n### Are there any \"Unpaid\" expense type entries that could lead to Accounts Payable?\n- All expenses (`Administrative Expenses`, `Sales Expenses`, `Financial Expenses`) are also marked as **Paid**.\n\n### Any other entries indicating accounts payable/unpaid supplier liability?\n- No. All supplier and expense entries are paid.\n\n## Step 3: Confirm End Value\n\n**No new payables have been created during the period.**\n**Accounts payable was never credited initially.**\n**No \"Unpaid\" entries for purchases or expenses.**\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Final Statement\n\n### Accounts Payable Initial Value:   0.00  \n### Accounts Payable End Value:      0.00\n\n---\n\n## Final Solution\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"0.00\"} }\n```",
