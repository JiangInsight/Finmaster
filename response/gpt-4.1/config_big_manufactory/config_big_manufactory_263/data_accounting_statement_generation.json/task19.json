Cash and Bank account changes\n- Start: Cash = 5,000,000; Bank = 15,000,000\n\n#### B. Asset movements:\nLet's track the effect of each transaction type:\n\n**1. Purchases:** You buy inventory/assets, which are paid in cash/bank, so:\n  - Inventory increases by purchases; cash/bank decreases.\n\n**2. Expenses:** Paid in cash/bank, reduces cash/bank directly.\n\n**3. Depreciation:** Reduces fixed assets, increases expenses (neutral for total asset value—depreciation allocates cost).\n\n**4. Sales:** \n   - If 'Paid': Cash/Bank increases\n   - If 'Unpaid': Increase Receivables\n   - Inventory reduces by cost of sold goods/assets\n   - Profit is recognized, but for asset calculation, we focus on cash/bank/receivables and inventory\n\n**5. Interest Receivable:** Increase interest receivable asset.\n\n**6. Transfers (Bank↔Cash):** Internal, no impact on overall assets.\n\nNow, let's proceed to **calculate each component's ending balance**.\n\n### (a) Purchases\n\n| id                | Type     | Amount  | Asset impact                                                              |\n|-------------------|----------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | Purchase | 800,000 | Inventory +800,000;

But, if some purchases are intended for Fixed Assets, we should discern from context.\n\nHowever, according to the table, there are no explicit new Fixed Asset purchases—most purchases are 'inventory' for resale (based on them being Heavy Equipment A/B/C/D, which is being sold further). Let's keep initial 'Fixed Assets' as is.\n\nDepreciation:\n- 45,750.46 (20240101001)\n- 45,748.42 (20240201002)\n\nTotal depreciation:\n45,750.46 + 45,748.42 = **91,498.88**\n\nSo, Fixed Assets at end = 8,000,000 - 91,498.88 = **7,908,501.12**\n\n### (f) Inventory (at cost)\n\nLet's calculate the ending inventory:\n- Initial: 0 (since all inventory comes from purchases)\n- + Purchases: 19,500,000.00\n- - Cost of sold goods/assets: 10,400,000.00\n\nEnding inventory: 19,500,000 - 10,400,000 = **9,100,000.00**\n\n### (g) Cash and Bank calculation (net)\n\nSince the only money movements out of cash/bank are purchases and expenses, and money back in is from paid sales.\n\nBut we also have **transfers** between bank and cash, which net to zero.\n\nLet's recalculate precisely:\n\n#### CASH\n\nInitial Cash: 5,000,000\n\n**Outflows from cash:**\nAll purchases marked 'Paid' via 'Cash':\nFrom the earlier list: total purchases paid via cash = 6,900,000.\n\nExpenses paid via cash (from earlier): 2,686,784.36\n\nTotal cash outflows: 6,900,000 + 2,686,784.36 = 9,586,784.36\n\n**Inflows to cash:**\nAll sales marked 'Paid' and with payment_method cash (from sales table):\nUsing amounts from above:\nAll 'Paid' sales total: 4,321,366.07\n\nBut 'payment_method' sometimes is blank—assume default is cash if not specified.\n\nALSO, notice 'Transfer' events:\n\n- Transfer20240130001: Bank to cash, 1,000,000\n- Transfer20240201001: Bank to cash, 1,000,000\n\nSo, cash increases by 2,000,000 via bank transfer.\n\n**Net cash:**\nInitial: 5,000,000  \n+4,321,366.07 (sales inflows)  \n+2,000,000 (transfers from bank)  \n-9,586,784.36 (all purchases + expenses via cash)\n\n= (5,000,000 + 4,321,366.07 + 2,000,000) - 9,586,784.36\n= 11,321,366.07 - 9,586,784.36\n= **1,734,581.71**\n\n#### BANK\n\nInitial: 15,000,000\n\n**Outflows:**\nAll purchases via bank transfer: 11,900,000\n\nOf the above expenses, those paid via bank? Expenses are all paid via cash per the table, so skip.\n\nTransfers from bank to cash: 2,000,000 (see Transfer events; negative for bank)\n\nTotal bank outflows: 11,900,000 (purchases) + 2,000,000 (transfer to cash) = 13,900,000\n\n**Inflows:**\nNone recorded directly; all paid sales are allocated to cash. No sales specify 'Bank' as payment method.\n\n**Net bank:**\n15,000,000 - 13,900,000 = **1,100,000.00**\n\n### Now sum all final assets\n\n- Cash:                       1,734,581.71\n- Bank:                       1,100,000.00\n- Fixed Assets:               7,908,501.12\n- Inventory:                  9,100,000.00\n- Accounts Receivable:       10,221,447.35\n- Interest Receivable:          20,559.00\n\n**Total Assets / Liabilities and Owner's Equity at end:**\n\nSum up:\n1,734,581.71  \n+1,100,000.00 → 2,834,581.71  \n+7,908,501.12 → 10,743,082.83  \n+9,100,000.00 → 19,843,082.83  \n+10,221,447.35 → 30,064,530.18  \n+20,559.00 → **30,085,089.18**\n\n## STEP 4: Present the solution as required JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\", \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"30085089.18\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\", \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"30085089.18\"} }\n```",
