Find Initial Inventory\nReview all entries of type \"Initial\" and look for anything related to inventory.\n\nFrom the \"Initial\" rows:\n- Cash deposit: 5,000,000.0\n- Bank deposit: 15,000,000.0\n- Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.0\n\nThere is nothing mentioning inventory or stock; only cash, bank, and fixed assets are set as opening assets.\n\n**Therefore, Initial Inventory is 0.00**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Calculate Purchases and Sales (Affecting Inventory)\nWe look for all entries of type \"Purchase\" and \"Sale\", using the product details, focusing on \"Heavy Equipment A, B, C, D\".\n\nWe will record, for all products:\n- Purchases (add to inventory)\n- Sales (remove from inventory)\n- Use cost per unit for tracking value\n\nWe work unit-by-unit and use FIFO (as in the sample).\n\n---\n\n### Purchases\nLet’s sum up, sorted for clarity.\n\n#### P001 Heavy Equipment A\n1. Purchase, S004, 1 unit, 500,000.0/unit\n2. Purchase, S002, 2 units, 500,000.0/unit\n3. Purchase, S007, 1 unit, 500,000.0/unit\n4. Purchase, S001, 2 units, 1,000,000.0/unit → WAIT: see issue, but let's be careful: S001 is P003, so ignore this.\n5. Purchase, S009, 1 unit, 500,000.0/unit\n\nTotal: (1+2+1+1) = **5 units purchased**\nFIFO costs: 1×500k + 2×500k + 1×500k + 1×500k = **5×500k = 2,500,000**\n\n#### P002 Heavy Equipment B\n1. Purchase, S010, 1 unit, 800,000.0/unit\n2. Purchase, S010, 1 unit, 800,000.0/unit\n3. Purchase, S010, 1 unit, 800,000.0/unit\n4. Purchase, S005, 1 unit, 800,000.0/unit\n5. Purchase, S009, 2 units, 800,000.0/unit\n\nTotal: (1+1+1+1+2) = **6 units purchased**\nCosts: 3×800k + 1×800k + 2×800k = **6×800k = 4,800,000**\n\n#### P003 Heavy Equipment C\n1. Purchase, S010, 2 units, 1,000,000.0/unit\n2. Purchase, S001, 2 units, 1,000,000.0/unit\n3. Purchase, S010, 2 units, 1,000,000.0/unit\n4. Purchase, S008, 2 units, 1,500,000.0/unit\n5. Purchase, S010, 2 units, 1,000,000.0/unit\n\nLet's check all for P003:\n- Purchase20231231005: S010, 2 units, 1,000,000/unit\n- Purchase20231231008: S001, 2 units, 1,000,000/unit\n- Purchase20231231013: S010, 2 units, 1,000,000/unit\n- Purchase20231231006: S008, 2 units, 1,500,000/unit\n\nSo, total: 2+2+2+2=**8 units**\nDetail: 2×1M + 2×1M + 2×1M + 2×1.5M = 2M + 2M + 2M + 3M = **9,000,000**\n\n#### P004 Heavy Equipment D\n1. Purchase S008, 2 units, 1,500,000/unit\n2. Purchase S004, 2 units, 1,500,000/unit\nTotal: 4 units, cost: 4×1.5M = **6,000,000**\n\n---\n\n### Total Purchased:\n- P001: 5 units, 2,500,000\n- P002: 6 units, 4,800,000\n- P003: 8 units, 9,000,000\n- P004: 4 units, 6,000,000\n\n---\n\n### Sales (units and cost out, FIFO)\n- For each Sale, remove from inventory FIFO cost.\n- Count units and apply per-product FIFO pricing.\n\n**List of \"Sale\" entries and units for each product:**\n\n#### P001 Heavy Equipment A\n- Sale20240113005: 1 unit, cost 500,000.0\n- Sale20240114007: 1 unit, cost 500,000.0\n\nAfter, let's see if there are more. Only these 2.\n\nTotal Sold: 2 units\n\n#### P002 Heavy Equipment B\n- Sale20240104001: 1 unit, cost 800,000.0\n- Sale20240118012: 1 unit, cost 800,000.0\n- Sale20240122018: 1 unit, cost 800,000.0\n- Sale20240114007: already assigned for P001\n\nTotal Sold: 3 units\n\n#### P003 Heavy Equipment C\n- Sale20240108002: 1 unit, cost 1,000,000.0\n- Sale20240109003: 1 unit, cost 1,000,000.0\n- Sale20240120015: 1 unit, cost 1,000,000.0\n- Sale20240125020: 1 unit, cost 1,000,000.0\n\nTotal Sold: 4 units\n\n#### P004 Heavy Equipment D\n- Sale20240115009: 1 unit, cost 1,500,000.0\n- Sale20240119014: 1 unit, cost 1,500,000.0\n\nTotal Sold: 2 units\n\n---\n\nLet's check once more in case any units were missed.\n\nNow, let's match per-product:\n\n#### P001 Heavy Equipment A\nAll sale transactions with \"P001\":\n- Sale20240113005: Sold 1 unit\n- Sale20240114007: Sold 1 unit\nTotal: 2 units\n\nInventory remaining: purchased 5, sold 2 ⇒ 3 units\n\n#### P002 Heavy Equipment B\n- Sale20240104001 (P002): 1\n- Sale20240118012 (P002): 1\n- Sale20240122018 (P002): 1\n\nInventory: purchased 6, sold 3 ⇒ 3 units left\n\n#### P003 Heavy Equipment C\n- Sale20240108002: 1\n- Sale20240109003: 1\n- Sale20240120015: 1\n- Sale20240125020: 1\n\nPurchased 8, sold 4 ⇒ 4 units left\n\n#### P004 Heavy Equipment D\n- Sale20240115009: 1\n- Sale20240119014: 1\n\nPurchased 4, sold 2 ⇒ 2 units left\n\n---\n\n## 3. Calculate Ending Inventory Value using FIFO\n\nWe need to know, for each product, which unit costs remain.\n\n### P001 – 5 purchased, 2 sold (sold oldest first)\n\nPurchases:\n1. S004: 1×500,000\n2. S002: 2×500,000\n3. S007: 1×500,000\n4. S009: 1×500,000\n\nFIFO, the first 2 units sold will be from the first 2 purchases i.e. (1 from S004, 1 from S002).\n\nRemaining:\n- 1 (from S002, 2nd unit)\n- 1 (from S007)\n- 1 (from S009)\nAll at 500,000/unit\n\n**Inventory: 3 × 500,000 = 1,500,000**\n\n---\n\n### P002 – 6 purchased, 3 sold\n\nPurchases:\n1. S010 1×800,000\n2. S010 1×800,000\n3. S010 1×800,000\n4. S005 1×800,000\n5. S009 2×800,000\n\nFirst 3 sold: Take from oldest first.\n- S010 first: 3×800,000 = all three S010 units gone.\n\nLeft:\n- S005: 1×800,000\n- S009: 2×800,000\n\nTotal: (1+2)=3 units × 800,000 = **2,400,000**\n\n---\n\n### P003 – 8 purchased, 4 sold\n\nPurchases:\n1.

S008: 2×1,500,000\n\nSales: 4 units\n\nFIFO:\n- 1st: S010: 1,000,000\n- 2nd: S010: 1,000,000\n- 3rd: S001: 1,000,000\n- 4th: S001: 1,000,000\n\nSold total: all S010's 2 units (1M each) + S001's 2 units (1M each)\n\nLeft:\n- S010: 2×1,000,000 (from 3rd purchase)\n- S008: 2×1,500,000\n\nTotal: (2×1,000,000 + 2×1,500,000) = 2,000,000 + 3,000,000 = **5,000,000**\n\n---\n\n### P004 – 4 purchased, 2 sold\n\nPurchases:\n1. S008: 2×1,500,000\n2. S004: 2×1,500,000\n\nSales: 2 units\n\nFIFO: Both taken from the 1st purchase (S008's 2 units).\n\nLeft: S004: 2×1,500,000\n\nTotal: 2×1,500,000 = **3,000,000**\n\n---\n\n## 4. Add Up All Inventory Remaining (Value)\n\n- P001: 1,500,000\n- P002: 2,400,000\n- P003: 5,000,000\n- P004: 3,000,000\n\n**Inventory End Value = 1,500,000 + 2,400,000 + 5,000,000 + 3,000,000 = 11,900,000**\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Inventory End Value\": \"11900000.00\"} }\n```",
