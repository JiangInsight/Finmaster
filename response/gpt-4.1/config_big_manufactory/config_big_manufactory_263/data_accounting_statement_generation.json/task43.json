Initial principle\n\n- The **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities** (indirect method) measures **actual *cash* received/paid** in the current period from the company's core business.\n- **IGNORE** (do *not* count):\n  - Fixed assets purchases/depreciation (investing)\n  - Bank/cash transfers between accounts (not operating cash flow)\n- **INCLUDE**:\n  - Cash received from sales to customers (if \"Paid\", and if \"Cash\" or blank under \"payment_method\" or \"receive_method\")\n  - Cash paid to suppliers for inventory (Purchases, \"Paid\", and \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\")\n  - Cash paid for operating expenses (admin/financial/sales expense, \"Paid\", \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\")\n- **IGNORE**:\n  - Unpaid transactions (do not affect cash)\n  - Interest receivable accruals (only count if received/paid in cash, these are not actual cash movements here)\n  - All \"Unpaid\" and all \"Interest Receivables\" lines\n  - All \"Depreciation\" lines\n\n#### 2. Sift through the table\n\n##### Find **all cash OUT** for operating uses:\n- **Purchases** (excluding fixed assets! Only for inventory: \"Heavy Equipment\", which is being resold in this business, acts as merchandise inventory)\n    - All purchases are \"Paid\" via \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" (i.e., these are operating outflows)\n    - DO include purchases, as inventory purchase is an operating outflow.\n\n- **Cash Operating Expenses**:\n    - If \"Paid\" and expense type (administrative, sales, or financial): YES, include, cash outflow.\n\n##### Find **all cash IN** from operations:\n- **Sales**: If \"Paid\" and cash/bank, include as inflow.\n\n#### 3.

They represent the funds with which the business starts. **Do not include these in operating cash flow calculation.**\n\n---\n\n##### 6. OPERATING CASH INFLOW/OUTFLOW SUMMARY\n\n- **Total inflow:** 4,321,365.07\n- **Total outflow (expenses):** 2,938,733.22\n- **Total outflow (inventory purchases):** 18,000,000.00\n- **Net Operating Cash Flow:** 4,321,365.07 - (2,938,733.22 + 18,000,000.00) = 4,321,365.07 - 20,938,733.22 = **-16,617,368.15**\n\nBut let's check the sales side, as there may be more *Paid* sales. Carefully check for all \"Sale\" entries with \"Paid\":\n\nFrom the data, for all \"Sale\" entries, if \"Paid\", add the amount.\n\nFrom above:  \nSale20240109003: 1,488,988.96  \nSale20240114007:   658,220.20  \nSale20240118012: 1,105,445.95  \nSale20240122018: 1,068,710.96\n\nNow, let's check if there are more:\n\n- Sale20240108002: 1,378,082.08 (Unpaid, so not included)\n- Sale20240113005:   668,830.84 (Unpaid, so not included)\n- Sale20240104001: 1,041,848.53 (Unpaid, skip)\n- Sale20240115009: 2,106,067.17 (Unpaid)\n- Sale20240119014: 2,200,530.42 (Unpaid)\n- Sale20240120015: 1,497,917.10 (Unpaid)\n- Sale20240125020: 1,328,171.21 (Unpaid)\n\nSeems above selection is accurate.\n\n---\n\n##### 7. FINAL ANSWER\n\nCalculate:\n\n- Outflows: \n  - Purchases: 18,000,000.00\n  - Expenses:   2,938,733.22\n  - Total Outflow: 20,938,733.22\n\n- Inflows (cash, paid):\n  - Sales: 4,321,365.07\n\nSo,\n\n**Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:**\n\n4,321,365.07 (receipts)\n- 20,938,733.22 (payments)\n= **-16,617,368.15**\n\nBut this is not matching sample solution style (check for mistakes!).\n\nWait: All purchases above are \"Paid\", but payment method for some is \"Bank Transfer\". Is it operating? Yes, if it's inventory, not fixed asset. All \"Purchases\" in the table are for \"Heavy Equipment\", which appears to be the main product bought and sold (so belong in operating).\n\nAre any purchases for \"Fixed Asset\" (non-inventory)? Let's look:\n\nFrom the top, there is:\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 8000000.0 | ...\n\nAnd\n| Purchase20231231001 | Purchase | ... | 800000.0 | ... | P002 | Heavy Equipment B | ...\n\nSo, only lines where type is \"Fixed Assets\" are non-operating.\n\nSo, **do not include** the 8,000,000.00 \"Fixed Assets\" entry as purchase outflow â€“ it's investing.\n\nLet us check the sample calculation. For example, in your sample, purchases on inventory are counted in operating, opening balances are ignored, interest is ignored, unpaid is ignored.\n\nSo, the **calculation is correct**.\n\n---\n\n##### 8. CORRECTED FINAL ANSWER\n\n**Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: 4,321,365.07 - 20,938,733.22 = -16,617,368.15**\n\nBut in the sample, they do not include each purchase fully if part is not paid (but in your data, all purchases are \"Paid\"). At the top, all purchases are \"Paid\".\n\nThus, **final:**  \n**Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -16,617,368.15\n\n---\n\n### Proper Solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-16617368.15\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n#### Optionally, if you want to see the \"Cash\" and \"Bank Transfer\" separated:  \nYou could break down by payment method, but as all are \"Paid\", they all count as operating cash outflows.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-16617368.15\"}}\n```",
