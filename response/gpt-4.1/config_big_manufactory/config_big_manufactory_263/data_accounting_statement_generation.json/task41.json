In cash flow statements, this line reflects the net change in payables related to supplier purchases—i.e. if you buy goods on credit, A/P increases; if you pay down old A/P, it decreases.\n\n## 2. **What transactions matter?**\nOnly those that relate to **accounts payable**—i.e. purchases from suppliers that are NOT immediately paid in cash/bank.\n\n## 3. **Is there an opening balance?**\nNo opening (beginning) balance for accounts payable is shown (no mention in Initial balances). So, unless it's specified elsewhere, we assume it started at zero.\n\n## 4. **Go through each purchase:**\nLet's find any purchases that were NOT paid in cash/bank—those that have A/P.\n\nFor each **Purchase** row, check the **payment/receipt_status** and **payment_method**: \n\n- If Paid: No impact on A/P. \n- If Unpaid/Partially Paid/Account Payable: Increase A/P.\n\n### **From the data given**\n\nHere is a breakdown of each Purchase:\n\n| id                | amount   | payment/receipt_status | payment_method     | \n|-------------------|----------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | 800,000  | Paid                  | Cash               |\n| Purchase20231231002 | 500,000  | Paid                  | Cash               |\n| Purchase20231231003 | 1,000,000| Paid                  | Bank Transfer      |\n| Purchase20231231004 | 800,000  | Paid                  | Cash               |\n| Purchase20231231005 | 2,000,000| Paid                  | Bank Transfer      |\n| Purchase20231231006 | 3,000,000| Paid                  | Bank Transfer      |\n| Purchase20231231007 | 800,000  | Paid                  | Bank Transfer      |\n| Purchase20231231008 | 2,000,000| Paid                  | Cash               |\n| Purchase20231231009 | 500,000  | Paid                  | Bank Transfer      |\n| Purchase20231231010 | 3,000,000| Paid                  | Bank Transfer      |\n| Purchase20231231011 | 800,000  | Paid                  | Cash               |\n| Purchase20231231012 | 1,600,000| Paid                  | Bank Transfer      |\n| Purchase20231231013 | 2,000,000| Paid                  | Cash               |\n\n**All purchase entries are shown as \"Paid\" (either by Cash or Bank Transfer). There are NO purchases recorded as Unpaid, Account Payable, or similar.**\n\n## 5. **Are there any other entries that might affect A/P?**\nReview all \"type\" fields in the journal dump for any credits or other non-cash payments:\n\n- No manual \"Accounts Payable\" entries.\n- No non-cash purchases.\n- No explicit mention of an opening or closing balance of A/P.\n\n## 6. **Conclusion**\n- **No purchases on credit.**\n- **No opening nor closing balance of accounts payable.**\n\nSo, the **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable** is **zero**.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"0.00\"} }\n```",
