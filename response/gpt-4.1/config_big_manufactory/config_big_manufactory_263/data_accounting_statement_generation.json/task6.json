Identify Current Assets and Non-current Assets**\n\n**Current assets**:  \n- Cash and cash equivalents (cash, bank deposit, bank-to-cash and cash-to-bank are just internal transfers, so the sum is still current asset)\n- Accounts Receivable (from sales with \"Account Receviable\"/\"Unpaid\" to customers)\n- Interest Receivables (shown as \"Interest Receviable\")\n- Inventory, if any (purchases to resell, but in this particular problem, all purchases seem of heavy equipment and then immediately sold; so inventory at end may be zero, after considering cost of sold and what remains)\n\n**Non-current assets** (excluded from current assets):\n- Fixed Assets (marked as \"Fixed Assets\" in initial balances and as purchases of fixed assets--but all purchases here are heavy equipment intended to be resold, not for own use)\n- Depreciation (decreases the book value of fixed assets, but not included in current assets)\n\n**Note:**  \nIn this business context, \"Purchase\" flows (with supplier and product as heavy equipment) are likely considered inventory until sold.\n\nSo, current assets at end are:\n- Cash (cash in hand)\n- Bank deposit\n- Accounts receivable (invoices to customers not yet paid at the end)\n- Interest receivable (as accrued but unpaid interests at the end)\n- Inventory (unsold heavy equipment at the end, valued at cost)\n\n---\n\n## **2.

Other cash in/out**\n\n- **Interest receivables:**\n  These are not cash inflows until actually received, so do not affect cash until paid. They are included in \"Interest Receivable\" current asset (see later).\n\n---\n\n#### **D. Cash & Bank** \n\n*Note*: Since \"bank to cash transfer\" is technically a transfer between the two, the sum of the two is what's tracked.\n\nLet's attempt to assemble an ending cash + bank deposit position:\n\n- Begin:\n    - Cash: 5,000,000  \n    - Bank: 15,000,000\n\n- **Cash sales**: +4,321,366.07\n- **Bank to cash transfers**: +1,000,000 (01-30), +1,000,000 (02-01) = +2,000,000\n\n- **Expenses paid via cash**: –2,938,733.22\n\n- **Purchases paid with cash**: From above, cash purchases, sum:\n 6,900,000 (from before)  \n- **Purchases paid with bank transfer**: 11,900,000 (from before)\n\nNow, did we account for the purchases correctly? Purchases \"use up\" cash or bank and add to inventory.\n\nLet's split cash and bank data.\n\n**Cash:**\n- Opening: 5,000,000\n- Sales: +4,321,366.07\n- Bank to cash: +2,000,000\n- Purchases (cash): –6,900,000\n- Expenses: –2,938,733.22\n\nSo:\n5,000,000 + 4,321,366.07 + 2,000,000 = 11,321,366.07  \n11,321,366.07 – 6,900,000 = 4,421,366.07  \n4,421,366.07 – 2,938,733.22 = **1,482,632.85**\n\nBut, be careful: there is also \"Purchase\" lines with \"Paid Bank Transfer\" (using bank deposit balance); and expenses paid \"Cash\" (yes). Sales that are \"Paid\" (with payment method not shown, but not AR) would go to cash or bank (but our data shows only cash as flow; unless otherwise specified, assign to cash). No explicit bank income from sales shown.\n\n**Bank:**\n- Opening: 15,000,000\n- Purchases via bank: –11,900,000\n- Bank to cash transfers: –2,000,000 (sum of both transfers)\n\n15,000,000 — 11,900,000 = 3,100,000  \n3,100,000 — 2,000,000 = **1,100,000**\n\n(Note: bank did not receive any income directly, all paid sales are via cash as per data.)\n\n**Final Cash:**        1,482,632.85  \n**Final Bank:**        1,100,000.00\n\n---\n\n### **E. Accounts Receivable (from sales with AR/unpaid)**\n\nSum all sales invoices which are \"Unpaid\" (i.e., \"Account Receivable\") and have not been subsequently paid (the problem seems to be a cut-off at end of data, so we sum all with \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Receivable\"). Let’s list:\n\n| Date        | Amount        |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| 2024-01-04  | 1,041,848.53 |\n| 2024-01-08  | 1,378,082.08 |\n| 2024-01-13  |   668,830.84 |\n| 2024-01-15  | 2,106,067.17 |\n| 2024-01-19  | 2,200,530.42 |\n| 2024-01-20  | 1,497,917.10 |\n| 2024-01-25  | 1,328,171.21 |\n\nTotal =  \nAdd first two:  \n1,041,848.53 + 1,378,082.08 = 2,419,930.61\n\nNext add 668,830.84:  \n2,419,930.61 + 668,830.84 = 3,088,761.45\n\nNext add 2,106,067.17:  \n3,088,761.45 + 2,106,067.17 = 5,194,828.62\n\nNext add 2,200,530.42:  \n5,194,828.62 + 2,200,530.42 = 7,395,359.04\n\nNext add 1,497,917.10:  \n7,395,359.04 + 1,497,917.10 = 8,893,276.14\n\nNext add 1,328,171.21:  \n8,893,276.14 + 1,328,171.21 = **10,221,447.35**\n\nIs that correct? Let's check.\n\nBut, what about sales to customers that may have been subsequently paid? Our data does not show any such receipts, and since all \"Unpaid\" sales entries are AR, and the dates match the Invoice, they all appear to remain AR as of the date.\n\n**Accounts Receivable End Value**: **10,221,447.35**\n\n---\n\n### **F.
