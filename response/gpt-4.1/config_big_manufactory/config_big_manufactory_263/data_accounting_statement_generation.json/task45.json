For this problem, ignore operating (e.g. expenses, sales) and financing activities (e.g. capital injection, loan).\n\n**Step 2: Locate relevant transactions**\nFrom the dataset, items that affect investing cash flows are typically:\n- Purchases of fixed assets (including equipment, heavy machinery, vehicles, etc.)\n- Sales of such assets (not just inventory)\n\nIn this data, \"Purchase\" and initial \"Fixed Assets\" records represent investment (cash outflows), and \"Sale\" of heavy equipment may correspond to fixed asset sales (cash inflows).\n\n**Step 3: Identify and sum up investing cash outflows**\n- Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | ... | amount: 8,000,000.00  (opening balance, not a cash transaction in this period; may be prior investment)\n- Purchases labeled as for heavy equipment: All \"Purchase\" transactions in the table are for \"Heavy Equipment\" (A, B, C, D).\n\nAll of these \"Purchase\" transactions are for heavy equipment with payment.
