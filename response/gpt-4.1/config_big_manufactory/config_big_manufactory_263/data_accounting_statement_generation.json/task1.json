Purchases by Bank Transfer or unpaid are not counted for cash outflow.\n\n---\n\n#### Cash Inflows From Customer Sales\nOnly the following inflow to cash on hand: sales with **Paid** receipt_status, and **sales** should have a Paid status with Cash inflow.\n- On this data set, the cash sales with Paid status and payment method Cash:\n\nFrom provided sales:\n- Sale20240109003 | Sale|2024-01-09 |1,488,988.96 | Paid | (No payment method field, but in the sample 'Cash' in that column. Let's assume, by default if Paid, and not otherwise specified, as bank deposit, since payments are generally by bank for large equipmentâ€”unless it's specified in 'payment_method'. But in your data here, it's ambiguous.)\n\nBut, checking all 'Sale' lines, only a few have 'Paid' status and theoretically could be cash, but the 'payment_method' column is missing for sales in this question. By convention, assume all 'Paid' sale transactions are bank received unless stated as 'Cash' payment (unlike the previous example which had the 'payment_method' filled in). In this table, since payment_method for all sales is blank, **assume all sales payments are NOT received to Cash on Hand directly** (otherwise, we'd include).\n\nSo, only **explicit cash inflows** are via \"Bank to Cash Transfer\".\n\n---\n\n### 3.
