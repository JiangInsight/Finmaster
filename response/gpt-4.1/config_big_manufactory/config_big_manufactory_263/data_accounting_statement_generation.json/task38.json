                        "content": "Let's solve step by step:\n\n## 1. Find the opening (beginning) Accounts Receivable balance\n\n- There is **NO initial Accounts Receivable balance** provided in this data. (No current asset named \"Accounts Receivable\" was listed in opening balances, only Cash, Bank, and Fixed Assets.)\n\n**So initial Accounts Receivable is: 0.0**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Find all sales \"on account\" (where cash is NOT received, i.e., Unpaid, paid via Account Receivable or similar):\n\nLook for all **Sale** rows that are \"Unpaid\" or have \"Account Receivable\" as receive_method.\n\n### Scanning the data:\n\n#### Sale, Unpaid or Account Receivable:\n\n| id              | date       | amount        |\n|-----------------|------------|--------------|\n| Sale20240104001 | 2024-01-04 | 1041848.53   |\n| Sale20240108002 | 2024-01-08 | 1378082.08   |\n| Sale20240113005 | 2024-01-13 | 668830.84    |\n| Sale20240115009 | 2024-01-15 | 2106067.17   |\n| Sale20240119014 | 2024-01-19 | 2200530.42   |\n| Sale20240120015 | 2024-01-20 | 1497917.10   |\n| Sale20240125020 | 2024-01-25 | 1328171.21   |\n\nLet's check their payment method / status to confirm they're all on account:\n\n- 2024-01-04: Unpaid, Account Receviable\n- 2024-01-08: Unpaid, Account Receviable\n- 2024-01-13: Unpaid, Account Receviable\n- 2024-01-15: Unpaid, Account Receviable\n- 2024-01-19: Unpaid, Account Receviable\n- 2024-01-20: Unpaid, Account Receviable\n- 2024-01-25: Unpaid, Account Receviable\n\n**Total Sales on Account:**\n\n1041848.53  \n+ 1378082.08  \n+ 668830.84  \n+ 2106067.17  \n+ 2200530.42  \n+ 1497917.10  \n+ 1328171.21  \n= **10,229,447.35**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Find all \"Collections\" of receivables during the period\n\n- Look for **Sale** rows which are Paid (received in cash or bank), and for which the method is not Account Receivable.\n\nFirst, check all \"Sale\" entries with \"Paid\". But these are not collections of previous AR, these are immediate cash sales.\n\n**BUT there is NO indication in data of previous AR being paid off.**  \n\nNo \"Payment received\" or \"Collection\" entries; all paid sales appear to be \"point of sale, cash received directly\".\n\n**THEREFORE:**  \n- ALL sales marked as \"Paid\" are just cash sales, do NOT reduce AR, do not count as AR collection here.\n- Only those \"Unpaid\" sales create AR; unless subsequent payment transactions occur (not in data), **all AR is outstanding at period end**.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Calculate the Final Accounts Receivable Balance\n\n**Initial AR** = 0.0  \n**+ All Credit Sales** = 10,229,447.35  \n**- Collections** (None listed)  \n= **Ending AR: 10,229,447.35**\n\n**The increase in AR on the cash flow statement = Ending AR - Beginning AR = 10,229,447.35 - 0.0 = 10,229,447.35 (an increase).**\n\nPer cash flow reporting convention, this is presented as:\n\n- (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable: **-10,229,447.35**\n\n---\n\n## 5. Final answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-10229447.35\"} }\n```\n",
