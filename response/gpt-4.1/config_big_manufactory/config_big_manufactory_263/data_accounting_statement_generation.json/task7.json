Identify Initial Fixed Assets\n\nFrom the data:\n- `| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | ... | amount | 8000000.0 | ... |`\n\n**Initial Fixed Assets Value = 8,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Identify All Purchases of Fixed Assets\n\nPurchases are entries of type \"Purchase\" for equipment (Heavy Equipment A, B, C, D):\n\n| id | type | product_name | amount |\n|---|------|--------------|--------|\n| Purchase20231231002 | Purchase | Heavy Equipment A | 500,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231003 | Purchase | Heavy Equipment A | 1,000,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231004 | Purchase | Heavy Equipment B | 800,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231005 | Purchase | Heavy Equipment C | 2,000,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231006 | Purchase | Heavy Equipment D | 3,000,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231007 | Purchase | Heavy Equipment B | 800,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231008 | Purchase | Heavy Equipment C | 2,000,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231009 | Purchase | Heavy Equipment A | 500,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231010 | Purchase | Heavy Equipment D | 3,000,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231011 | Purchase | Heavy Equipment B | 800,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231012 | Purchase | Heavy Equipment B | 1,600,000.0 |\n| Purchase20231231013 | Purchase | Heavy Equipment C | 2,000,000.0 |\n\n**Total Purchases:**\n\nLet's sum up all purchase amounts:\n- 500,000\n- 1,000,000\n- 800,000\n- 2,000,000\n- 3,000,000\n- 800,000\n- 2,000,000\n- 500,000\n- 3,000,000\n- 800,000\n- 1,600,000\n- 2,000,000\n\nSum:\n= 500,000 + 1,000,000 = 1,500,000  \n+ 800,000 = 2,300,000  \n+ 2,000,000 = 4,300,000  \n+ 3,000,000 = 7,300,000  \n+ 800,000 = 8,100,000  \n+ 2,000,000 = 10,100,000  \n+ 500,000 = 10,600,000  \n+ 3,000,000 = 13,600,000  \n+ 800,000 = 14,400,000  \n+ 1,600,000 = 16,000,000  \n+ 2,000,000 = 18,000,000\n\n**Total Purchases: 18,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Identify All Sales of Fixed Assets\n\nSales are of type \"Sale\" with Heavy Equipment sold (not products).\n\nPrices:\n\n| id            | type | product_name       | amount  |\n|---------------|------|-------------------|---------|\n| Sale20240104001   | Sale | Heavy Equipment B  | 1,041,848.53 |\n| Sale20240108002   | Sale | Heavy Equipment C  | 1,378,082.08 |\n| Sale20240109003   | Sale | Heavy Equipment C  | 1,488,988.96 |\n| Sale20240113005   | Sale | Heavy Equipment A  | 668,830.84  |\n| Sale20240114007   | Sale | Heavy Equipment A  | 658,220.2   |\n| Sale20240115009   | Sale | Heavy Equipment D  | 2,106,067.17 |\n| Sale20240118012   | Sale | Heavy Equipment B  | 1,105,445.95 |\n| Sale20240119014   | Sale | Heavy Equipment D  | 2,200,530.42 |\n| Sale20240120015   | Sale | Heavy Equipment C  | 1,497,917.10 |\n| Sale20240122018   | Sale | Heavy Equipment B  | 1,068,710.96 |\n| Sale20240125020   | Sale | Heavy Equipment C  | 1,328,171.21 |\n\nNotice some equipment may be sold more than bought, so we'll need to track at cost.\n\n**But for balance sheet, we need to deduct the cost of assets sold, not the sales price.**\n\nFrom the sales lines, `cost_per_unit` is provided:\n\n| id                | product             | quantity | cost_per_unit | total_cost          |\n|-------------------|---------------------|----------|---------------|---------------------|\n| Sale20240104001   | Heavy Equipment B   | 1.0      | 800,000.0     | 800,000.00          |\n| Sale20240108002   | Heavy Equipment C   | 1.0      | 1,000,000.0   | 1,000,000.00        |\n| Sale20240109003   | Heavy Equipment C   | 1.0      | 1,000,000.0   | 1,000,000.00        |\n| Sale20240113005   | Heavy Equipment A   | 1.0      | 500,000.0     | 500,000.00          |\n| Sale20240114007   | Heavy Equipment A   | 1.0      | 500,000.0     | 500,000.00          |\n| Sale20240115009   | Heavy Equipment D   | 1.0      | 1,500,000.0   | 1,500,000.00        |\n| Sale20240118012   | Heavy Equipment B   | 1.0      | 800,000.0     | 800,000.00          |\n| Sale20240119014   | Heavy Equipment D   | 1.0      | 1,500,000.0   | 1,500,000.00        |\n| Sale20240120015   | Heavy Equipment C   | 1.0      | 1,000,000.0   | 1,000,000.00        |\n| Sale20240122018   | Heavy Equipment B   | 1.0      | 800,000.0     | 800,000.00          |\n| Sale20240125020   | Heavy Equipment C   | 1.0      | 1,000,000.0   | 1,000,000.00        |\n\nTotal cost of equipment sold:\n= 800,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 + 1,500,000 + 800,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,000,000 + 800,000 + 1,000,000\n\nAdd step by step:\n- 800,000 + 1,000,000 = 1,800,000\n- + 1,000,000 = 2,800,000\n- + 500,000 = 3,300,000\n- + 500,000 = 3,800,000\n- + 1,500,000 = 5,300,000\n- + 800,000 = 6,100,000\n- + 1,500,000 = 7,600,000\n- + 1,000,000 = 8,600,000\n- + 800,000 = 9,400,000\n- + 1,000,000 = 10,400,000\n\n**Total asset cost disposed: 10,400,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### 4. Identify Depreciation Charges\n\nThere are two depreciation entries:\n\n| id                     | type         | amount   |\n|------------------------|--------------|----------|\n| Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 45,750.46|\n| Depreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | 45,748.42|\n\n**Total depreciation: 45,750.46 + 45,748.42 = 91,498.88**\n\n---\n\n### 5. Calculate Final Fixed Assets\n\n**Formula:**\n```\nEnding Fixed Assets \n= Initial Fixed Assets \n+ Purchases \n- Cost of Fixed Assets Sold\n- Depreciation\n```\n\nLet's plug in the numbers:\n\n- Initial Fixed Assets:    8,000,000.00\n- Purchases:             18,000,000.00\n- Disposed Asset Cost:  -10,400,000.00\n- Depreciation:             -91,498.88\n\nSo:\n\n8,000,000  \n+ 18,000,000 = 26,000,000  \n- 10,400,000 = 15,600,000  \n- 91,498.88 = 15,508,501.12\n\n**But we need to verify if all purchases are fixed assets only. All \"Purchase\" entries are related to Heavy Equipment, so yes.\n\nAlso, are there any fixed asset disposals not listed as \"Sale\"? No.\n\n**\n\n---\n\n### 6. Review: Let's check number of each class of heavy asset at start and end\n\nFrom initial and purchases:\n\n- **Heavy Equipment A:** \n  - Purchases: 1 (500,000) + 2 (1,000,000) + 1 (500,000) = 4 units\n- **Heavy Equipment B:** \n  - Purchases: 1 (800,000) + 1 (800,000) + 1 (800,000) + 2 (1,600,000) = 5 units\n- **Heavy Equipment C:** \n  - Purchases: 2 (2,000,000) + 2 (2,000,000) + 2 (2,000,000) = 6 units\n- **Heavy Equipment D:** \n  - Purchases: 2 (3,000,000) + 2 (3,000,000) = 4 units\n\n**Total units purchased (excluding initial):**\nA: 4\nB: 5\nC: 6\nD: 4\n\nNow, sales:\n\nA: Sold 1 + 1 = 2 units\nB: Sold 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 units\nC: Sold 1 + 1 +1 + 1 +1 = 5 units\nD: Sold 1 + 1 = 2 units\n\n(Obtained from all \"Sale\" entries with product_name \"Heavy Equipment *\").\n\nRemains (from purchases and initial):\nAre we sure the initial fixed assets didn't include any existing heavy equipment? It could also include other assets (buildings, etc.), but with the purchase/sale/disposal numbers matching up for the current period, we'll proceed.\n\n**Alternatively**, the balance sheet usually only lists net value. The most direct method, as in the previous example, is to:\n\n**Start with Initial Fixed Assets Value**\n\n+ Add \"purchases\" during period\n- Subtract cost of sold assets (not sales price, but cost)\n- Subtract depreciation\n\nSo:\n- Initial:   8,000,000.00\n- Purchases:18,000,000.00\n- Sold:     10,400,000.00\n- Deprec:      91,498.88\n\nCalculation:\n8,000,000\n+ 18,000,000 = 26,000,000\n- 10,400,000 = 15,600,000\n-    91,498.88 = 15,508,501.12\n\n**Fixed Assets End Value: 15,508,501.12**\n\nBut you asked for 2 decimal places:\n\n**Fixed Assets End Value: 15,508,501.12**\n\n---\n\n### 7. Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"15508501.12\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Item                            | Value           |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|\n| Initial Fixed Assets             | 8,000,000.00   |\n| + Purchases                      | 18,000,000.00  |\n| - Asset Cost of Equipment Sold   | 10,400,000.00  |\n| - Depreciation                   |    91,498.88   |\n| = Ending Fixed Assets            | 15,508,501.12  |\n\n---\n\n## **Final Output**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"15508501.12\"} }\n```\n",
