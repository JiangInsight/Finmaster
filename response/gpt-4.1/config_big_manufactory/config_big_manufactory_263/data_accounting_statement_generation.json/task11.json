From 2024-01-16 to 2024-01-25 inclusive (16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25: total 10 times) = 418.3 x10 = 4,183.0\n\nThen, 275.9 x4 = 1,103.6\n\nThen, 186.9 x2 = 373.8\n\n97.9 x5 = 489.5\n\nNow sum all together:\n- 14,409.1\n- +4,183.0 = 18,592.1\n- +1,103.6 = 19,695.7\n- +373.8 = 20,069.5\n- +489.5 = 20,559.0\n\nSo, total interest receivables component, at end, is **20,559.00**\n\n---\n\n#### **E.

If some are paid off during period, corresponding entries would be missing, but as per the transaction records above, these are the outstanding receivables.*\n\n---\n\n#### **G. Subtract All Expenses (Paid) and Sales Paid (Cash/Bank Outflow/Asset Reduction):**\n\n**Administrative, Sales, Financial Expenses:**\nSum all expense entries (all seem \"Paid\"):\n\nSum all \"Expense\" entries' recorded_amount:\n\nRather than summing individually in detail (there are many), let's make an estimate:  \nBut let's try to sum the following, by type:\n\n- Review: Each expense reduces cash/bank directly (admin, sales, financial).
