Accounts Receivable Initial Value\n\nLook at the initial balances/rows:\n- | Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit … | amount: 5,000,000\n- | Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit … | amount: 15,000,000\n- | Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets … | amount: 8,000,000\n\nNone of the initial lines mention \"Accounts Receivable\".  \n\n**So, Initial Value is 0.00.**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Accounts Receivable End Value\n\nWe need to:\n- **Sum all sales that are \"Unpaid\" and go to \"Account Receviable\"** (Paid sales don't count for receivables)\n- **Do not subtract payments received against receivables, as no such payment entries are in this data**\n- **Ignore purchases, expenses, interests, etc. — those don’t affect accounts receivable unless specifically labeled as customers paying off receivables**\n\nLet’s scan for all **Sales** transactions, where \"payment/receipt_status\" is \"Unpaid\" and/or \"receive_method\" is \"Account Receviable\":\n\n### All sales to Account Receivable:\n\n| id               | amount        | receive_method    | payment/receipt_status |\n|------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n| Sale20240104001  | 1,041,848.53 | Account Receviable | Unpaid                 |\n| Sale20240108002  | 1,378,082.08 | Account Receviable | Unpaid                 |\n| Sale20240113005  |   668,830.84 | Account Receviable | Unpaid                 |\n| Sale20240115009  | 2,106,067.17 | Account Receviable | Unpaid                 |\n| Sale20240119014  | 2,200,530.42 | Account Receviable | Unpaid                 |\n| Sale20240120015  | 1,497,917.10 | Account Receviable | Unpaid                 |\n| Sale20240125020  | 1,328,171.21 | Account Receviable | Unpaid                 |\n\nCheck for more:\n- Are there other \"Sale\" rows with \"Unpaid\"/\"Account Receviable\"?
