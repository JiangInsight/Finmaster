                        "content": "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n## 1. What is being asked?\nWe need to find the final \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" to be reported in the cash flow statement, based on the above transaction data.\n\n## 2. What qualifies as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\"?\nIn the context of a cash flow statement (investing activities), this usually refers to cash paid for **property, plant, equipment or similar tangible assets** (not inventory or expenses). Purchases usually are identified in the data with references to equipment or fixed assets.\n\n## 3. Which entries should be considered?\nFrom the data:\n- Any row with type \"Purchase\" and product/equipment names like \"Heavy Equipment\" (NOT chemical/inventory/etc) indicates a purchase of fixed asset.\n- All relevant transactions are in the \"Purchase\" type.\n- All relevant purchases are already marked as Paid and show the payment method (either Cash or Bank Transfer).\n- Ignore the initial opening balance of \"Fixed Assets\" (this is from prior period, not current purchases).\n- Do NOT double count if the same asset is both paid by both cash and bank in two related rows (Check for that, but here each \"Purchase\" seems to be only once per asset).\n\n### Extract eligible transactions:\n\nLet's go through all lines with:\n- type = \"Purchase\"\n- product name includes \"Heavy Equipment\"\n- Paid\n\n#### Data Extraction:\n1. Purchase20231231001: 800,000.0 (\"Heavy Equipment B\") -- Paid, Cash\n2. Purchase20231231002: 500,000.0 (\"Heavy Equipment A\") -- Paid, Cash\n3. Purchase20231231003: 1,000,000.0 (\"Heavy Equipment A\") -- Paid, Bank Transfer\n4. Purchase20231231004: 800,000.0 (\"Heavy Equipment B\") -- Paid, Cash\n5. Purchase20231231005: 2,000,000.0 (\"Heavy Equipment C\") -- Paid, Bank Transfer\n6. Purchase20231231006: 3,000,000.0 (\"Heavy Equipment D\") -- Paid, Bank Transfer\n7. Purchase20231231007: 800,000.0 (\"Heavy Equipment B\") -- Paid, Bank Transfer\n8. Purchase20231231008: 2,000,000.0 (\"Heavy Equipment C\") -- Paid, Cash\n9. Purchase20231231009: 500,000.0 (\"Heavy Equipment A\") -- Paid, Bank Transfer\n10. Purchase20231231010: 3,000,000.0 (\"Heavy Equipment D\") -- Paid, Bank Transfer\n11. Purchase20231231011: 800,000.0 (\"Heavy Equipment B\") -- Paid, Cash\n12. Purchase20231231012: 1,600,000.0 (\"Heavy Equipment B\") -- Paid, Bank Transfer\n13. Purchase20231231013: 2,000,000.0 (\"Heavy Equipment C\") -- Paid, Cash\n\nLet's confirm that all are \"Heavy Equipment X\", and each row is a unique \"id\".\n\n## 4. Calculate the total\n\nSum all above:\n\n- 800,000\n- 500,000\n- 1,000,000\n- 800,000\n- 2,000,000\n- 3,000,000\n- 800,000\n- 2,000,000\n- 500,000\n- 3,000,000\n- 800,000\n- 1,600,000\n- 2,000,000\n\nNow, add step by step:\n\n1. 800,000 + 500,000 = 1,300,000  \n2. 1,300,000 + 1,000,000 = 2,300,000  \n3. 2,300,000 + 800,000 = 3,100,000  \n4. 3,100,000 + 2,000,000 = 5,100,000  \n5. 5,100,000 + 3,000,000 = 8,100,000  \n6. 8,100,000 + 800,000 = 8,900,000  \n7. 8,900,000 + 2,000,000 = 10,900,000  \n8. 10,900,000 + 500,000 = 11,400,000  \n9. 11,400,000 + 3,000,000 = 14,400,000  \n10. 14,400,000 + 800,000 = 15,200,000  \n11. 15,200,000 + 1,600,000 = 16,800,000  \n12. 16,800,000 + 2,000,000 = 18,800,000\n\n## 5. Final Answer\n\nThe total cash outflow for purchase of fixed assets is **18,800,000.0**\n\n## JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"18800000.0\"} }\n```",
