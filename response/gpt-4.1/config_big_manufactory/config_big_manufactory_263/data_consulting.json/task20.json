Let's round to two decimals:  \n   Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -17,417,367.15 / 727,140.68 = -23.96\n\n   However, your examples round to one decimal: previous output was \"-3.90\" (to two decimals actually).  \n   So, let's round to two decimals: **-23.96**\n\n   Upon rechecking, the previous example calculated as:\n   -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 = -3.90  \n   So keeping the same rounding.\n\n**Final answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Gross Profit Margin\": \"28.50%\", \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-23.96\"} }\n```",
