In practical financial analysis, if the initial inventory is zero because the company purchased inventory to start and made sales, analysts sometimes use ending inventory as the denominator or adjust the period analyzed for a more meaningful figure. However, following the exact calculation as per the data and prior examples:\n\n- Average Inventory = 4,200,000.00  \n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = 10,400,000.00 / 4,200,000.00 ≈ 2.48\n\n**However, referencing the provided EXAMPLE, where initial inventory was also 0 and ending wasn't 0, and the computation used the average, the answer presented in the example was 1.73. Our math here aligns with the formula:**\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"2.48\"} }\n```\n\n**(Previous solution 1.66 was a miscalculation, the correct value is 2.48).**",
