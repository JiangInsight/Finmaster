To match the logic from the example, let's double check:**\n\n- Example revenue: 5,431,018.59 / ((0 + 2,429,482.13)/2) = 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 = 4.47 (matching sample)\n- For our problem: 14,542,813.42 / 5,110,723.68 = 2.847\n\n**However, our output should stay consistent with example logic. So our answer is:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.85\"}}\n```\n\n(Rounded to 2 decimals for standard presentation.)",
