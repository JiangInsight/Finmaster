                        "content": "Let's solve this step by step.\n\n### 1. Identify Initial Value for Accounts Receivable\n\nLook for any initial balances for \"Accounts Receivable\" in the Initial rows (`type` like \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\").  \n**In this data, there is NO explicit initial balance for Accounts Receivable.**  \nSo we assume the initial value is **0.00**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Find Transactions Affecting Accounts Receivable\n\nAccounts Receivable increases when there are **sales on credit** (\"Unpaid\", \"Account Receviable\" as payment/receipt_status or receive_method).\n\nAccounts Receivable decreases when a **customer pays off a receivable** (not shown in this dataâ€”it would be a receipt with a corresponding reduction, but all sales with \"Paid\" are just cash sales, NOT a collection on A/R).\n\nWe **only sum up credit sales**, as payment receipts from prior credit sales are not part of this data.\n\n#### **Extracting Credit Sales**\n\nLet's identify all sales that were not paid at once (status \"Unpaid\" or \"receive_method\" set as \"Account Receviable\" or similar):\n\nLook for:\n- type: \"Sale\"\n- payment/receipt_status: \"Unpaid\" or receive_method: \"Account Receviable\" (or \"Account Receivable\")\n- amount: (to sum up)\n\n#### Let's list them by date for clarity:\n\n| id              | type | date       | amount      | payment/receipt_status | receive_method          |\n|-----------------|------|------------|-------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Sale20240111008 | Sale | 2024-01-11 | 1151336.63  | Unpaid                | Account Receviable      |\n| Sale20240114010 | Sale | 2024-01-14 | 693546.26   | Unpaid                | Account Receviable      |\n| Sale20240123021 | Sale | 2024-01-23 | 1076054.24  | Unpaid                | Account Receviable      |\n| Sale20240131033 | Sale | 2024-01-31 | 717864.25   | Unpaid                | Account Receviable      |\n| Sale20240202035 | Sale | 2024-02-02 | 660969.7    | Unpaid                | Account Receviable      |\n| Sale20240204038 | Sale | 2024-02-04 | 2109215.99  | Unpaid                | Account Receviable      |\n\nNote: Some sales with \"Unpaid\" don't have the words \"Account Receviable\", but are clearly credit sales.\n\n#### Let's check ALL sales with \"Unpaid\" or receive_method: Account Receviable.\n\nGo through each \"Sale\" entry:\n\n**(1) Sale20240111008:**  \namount: 1,151,336.63 | Unpaid | receive_method: Account Receviable\n\n**(2) Sale20240114010:**  \namount: 693,546.26 | Unpaid | receive_method: Account Receviable\n\n**(3) Sale20240123021:**  \namount: 1,076,054.24 | Unpaid | receive_method: Account Receviable\n\n**(4) Sale20240131033:**  \namount: 717,864.25 | Unpaid | receive_method: Account Receviable\n\n**(5) Sale20240202035:**  \namount: 660,969.70 | Unpaid | receive_method: Account Receviable\n\n**(6) Sale20240204038:**  \namount: 2,109,215.99 | Unpaid | receive_method: Account Receviable\n\n---\n\n### 3. Calculate the End Value of Accounts Receivable\n\nSum all of the amounts above:\n\n```\n= 1,151,336.63\n+   693,546.26\n+ 1,076,054.24\n+   717,864.25\n+   660,969.70\n+ 2,109,215.99\n-------------------------\n= 6,408,987.07\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. Format the Solution\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"6408987.07\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. Verification\n\nThese are all the \"Sale\" records marked as \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Receivable\" within the data.  \nNo collections/receipts from receivables are shown, so no reductions.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:** \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"6408987.07\"} }\n```",
