Identify Operating Activities:**\n\n- Cash receipts from sales of goods/services (cash sales only, not unpaid/AR sales)\n- Cash payments to suppliers/employees for inventory/purchases/expenses (only what is PAID, not unpaid or on account)\n- Interest received/paid (if related to business ops, otherwise ignore \"Receivable\" accrual lines)\n- Ignore: Acquisition/disposal of fixed assets (investing), capital contributions (financing), depreciation (non-cash), \"Initial\" equity/bank deposits, etc.\n\n---\n\n**2. Identify Cash Inflows from Operating Activities (cash receipts):**\n\nReview all sale transactions for cash receipts:\n- Sale: amount, if Paid.\n\nLet's list all sales that are \"Paid\":\n\n| date       | type  | amount      | Paid?    |\n| ---------- | ----- | ---------- | -------- |\n| 2024-01-06 | Sale  | 748087.14  | Paid     |\n| 2024-01-08 | Sale  | 2146535.22 | Paid     |\n| 2024-01-19 | Sale  | 1348068.18 | Paid     |\n| 2024-01-22 | Sale  | 694657.72  | Paid     |\n| 2024-01-24 | Sale  | 677364.56  | Paid     |\n| 2024-01-25 | Sale  | 2210585.18 | Paid     |\n| 2024-01-26 | Sale  | 661580.66  | Paid     |\n| 2024-01-30 | Sale  | 1492870.6  | Paid     |\n\nNow sum those amounts:\n\n```\n748087.14\n2146535.22\n1348068.18\n694657.72\n677364.56\n2210585.18\n661580.66\n1492870.6\n---------------\nSum = 10,976,749.26\n```\n\n---\n\n**3. Identify Cash Outflows from Operating Activities:**\n\nInclude:\n- Purchases PAID (exclude Account Payable/Unpaid)\n- Administrative, Sales, Financial Expenses: only those with payment status = Paid (i.e., all with \"Paid|Cash\", etc.)\n\nLet’s gather paid purchase transactions:\n\nPaid purchases (not Unpaid ones):\n\n1. Purchase20231231001 | 1,500,000 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n2. Purchase20231231002 | 500,000   | Paid | Bank Transfer\n3. Purchase20231231003 | 1,600,000 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n4.

Purchase20231231014 | 1,000,000 | Paid | Bank Transfer\n\nNow sum these:\n\n1,500,000\n+ 500,000\n+ 1,600,000\n+ 1,000,000\n+ 2,000,000\n+ 1,000,000\n+ 1,600,000\n+ 1,000,000\n+ 500,000\n+ 1,500,000\n+ 500,000\n+ 1,000,000\n= **13,700,000**\n\n(Note: Unpaid purchases (Account Payable) are NOT included!)\n\nNow all paid Operating Expenses: Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Financial Expenses (all marked as Paid):\n\nLet's sum these (listing and keeping a running total as we go).\n\n#### First, January:\n\n- 2024-01-01: Sales Expenses: 79,714.42\n- 2024-01-02: Financial Expenses: 51,825.36\n- 2024-01-02: Administrative Expenses: 46,725.01\n- 2024-01-03: Sales Expenses: 74,702.00\n- 2024-01-04: Administrative Expenses: 78,889.09\n- 2024-01-05: Sales Expenses: 38,780.99\n- 2024-01-05: Administrative Expenses: 68,900.09\n- 2024-01-06: Sales Expenses: 87,591.46\n- 2024-01-08: Financial Expenses: 52,268.2\n- 2024-01-08: Administrative Expenses: 19,689.35\n- 2024-01-09: Sales Expenses: 93,194.55\n- 2024-01-09: Administrative Expenses: 11,813.06\n- 2024-01-10: Administrative Expenses: 86,347.65\n- 2024-01-11: Financial Expenses: 57,634.90\n- 2024-01-12: Financial Expenses: 20,862.57\n- 2024-01-13: Administrative Expenses: 53,549.48\n- 2024-01-13: Sales Expenses: 20,833.95\n- 2024-01-14: Administrative Expenses: 31,910.69\n- 2024-01-15: Administrative Expenses: 46,434.69\n- 2024-01-15: Sales Expenses: 70,515.58\n- 2024-01-16: Sales Expenses: 73,168.68\n- 2024-01-16: Sales Expenses: 96,515.15\n- 2024-01-17: Financial Expenses: 69,211.25\n- 2024-01-17: Sales Expenses: 53,607.84\n- 2024-01-18: Sales Expenses: 14,562.34\n- 2024-01-19: Sales Expenses: 86,673.60\n- 2024-01-20: Financial Expenses: 87,474.45\n- 2024-01-21: Sales Expenses: 83,217.37\n- 2024-01-22: Sales Expenses: 28,972.8\n- 2024-01-23: Financial Expenses: 14,855.75\n- 2024-01-24: Sales Expenses: 39,148.75\n- 2024-01-25: Administrative Expenses: 67,082.31\n- 2024-01-26: Sales Expenses: 60,508.87\n- 2024-01-26: Sales Expenses: 33,905.06\n- 2024-01-27: Administrative Expenses: 10,253.90\n- 2024-01-27: Financial Expenses: 74,109.93\n- 2024-01-28: Sales Expenses: 42,910.54\n- 2024-01-28: Sales Expenses: 49,551.38\n- 2024-01-29: Sales Expenses: 63,370.00\n- 2024-01-30: Sales Expenses: 45,613.09\n- 2024-01-31: Sales Expenses: 42,688.86\n\nNow, after Jan 31 (from February):\n\n- 2024-02-01: Administrative Expenses: 58,370.92\n- 2024-02-01: Financial Expenses: 12,261.80\n- 2024-02-02: Sales Expenses: 31,799.89\n- 2024-02-03: Sales Expenses: 22,552.8\n- 2024-02-04: Financial Expenses: 83,123.11\n- 2024-02-05: Administrative Expenses: 25,065.28\n- 2024-02-05: Administrative Expenses: 90,539.15\n\nLet's sum these:\n\nWe'll use a running total for accuracy:\n\n1. 79,714.42\n2. +51,825.36 = 131,539.78\n3. +46,725.01 = 178,264.79\n4. +74,702.00 = 252,966.79\n5. +78,889.09 = 331,855.88\n6. +38,780.99 = 370,636.87\n7. +68,900.09 = 439,536.96\n8. +87,591.46 = 527,128.42\n9. +52,268.20 = 579,396.62\n10. +19,689.35 = 599,085.97\n11. +93,194.55 = 692,280.52\n12. +11,813.06 = 704,093.58\n13. +86,347.65 = 790,441.23\n14. +57,634.90 = 848,076.13\n15. +20,862.57 = 868,938.70\n16. +53,549.48 = 922,488.18\n17. +20,833.95 = 943,322.13\n18. +31,910.69 = 975,232.82\n19. +46,434.69 = 1,021,667.51\n20. +70,515.58 = 1,092,183.09\n21. +73,168.68 = 1,165,351.77\n22. +96,515.15 = 1,261,866.92\n23. +69,211.25 = 1,331,078.17\n24. +53,607.84 = 1,384,686.01\n25. +14,562.34 = 1,399,248.35\n26. +86,673.60 = 1,485,921.95\n27. +87,474.45 = 1,573,396.40\n28. +83,217.37 = 1,656,613.77\n29. +28,972.80 = 1,685,586.57\n30. +14,855.75 = 1,700,442.32\n31. +39,148.75 = 1,739,591.07\n32. +67,082.31 = 1,806,673.38\n33. +60,508.87 = 1,867,182.25\n34. +33,905.06 = 1,901,087.31\n35. +10,253.90 = 1,911,341.21\n36. +74,109.93 = 1,985,451.14\n37. +42,910.54 = 2,028,361.68\n38. +49,551.38 = 2,077,913.06\n39. +63,370.00 = 2,141,283.06\n40. +45,613.09 = 2,186,896.15\n41. +42,688.86 = 2,229,585.01\n---\n42. +58,370.92 = 2,287,955.93\n43. +12,261.80 = 2,300,217.73\n44. +31,799.89 = 2,332,017.62\n45. +22,552.80 = 2,354,570.42\n46. +83,123.11 = 2,437,693.53\n47. +25,065.28 = 2,462,758.81\n48. +90,539.15 = 2,553,297.96\n\n**Total Operating Expenses (cash outflows): 2,553,297.96**\n\n---\n\n**Total Outflows (Purchases + Paid Op.
