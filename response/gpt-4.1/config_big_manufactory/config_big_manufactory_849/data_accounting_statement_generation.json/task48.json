                        "content": "Let's break the problem into steps:\n\n## Step 1: Identify the Period and Opening Balances\n\n- The data begins with initial cash and bank deposits:\n  - Cash: 5,000,000.00\n  - Bank: 15,000,000.00\n- Opening cash and cash equivalents = 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 = **20,000,000.00**\n\n## Step 2: Identify All Cash Inflows\n\n### Inflow Categories:\n- Receipts from sales (\"Sale\" with Paid, usually Cash/Bank)\n- Note: Some \"Sale\" lines are marked Unpaid or Account Receivableâ€”ignore for cash flows!\n- (No mention of other sources like loan proceeds.)\n\n#### Go through each line, sum up:\n- Only take sales where payment is **Paid** (Cash/Bank/Bank Transfer). Some lines may have both paid and unpaid parts, but in this set, \"Paid\" typically means fully.\n- Assume purchases of fixed assets or purchases are outflows unless otherwise stated.\n\n**Relevant Sale (Cash In) lines:**\n\n1. Sale20240106004: 748,087.14 (Paid)\n2. Sale20240108006: 2,146,535.22 (Paid)\n3. Sale20240119016: 1,348,068.18 (Paid)\n4. Sale20240122019: 694,657.72 (Paid)\n5. Sale20240124022: 677,364.56 (Paid)\n6. Sale20240125024: 2,210,585.18 (Paid)\n7. Sale20240126025: 661,580.66 (Paid)\n8. Sale20240130031: 1,492,870.60 (Paid)\n- Sum:  \n  748,087.14  \n  +2,146,535.22  \n  +1,348,068.18  \n  +694,657.72  \n  +677,364.56  \n  +2,210,585.18  \n  +661,580.66  \n  +1,492,870.60  \n-------------------------\n  = **9,979,749.26**\n\n**Confirm: These are the only \"Sale\" lines with \"Paid\" as status.**\n\n## Step 3: Identify All Cash Outflows\n\n### Outflow Categories:\n- Purchases paid (excluding unpaid/account payable)\n- Fixed assets purchases paid\n- All expenses marked \"Paid\" (Sales, Admin, Financial)\n\n#### Identify purchases:\n- Purchase20231231001 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 1,500,000.00\n- Purchase20231231002 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 500,000.00\n- Purchase20231231003 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 1,600,000.00\n- Purchase20231231005 | Paid | Cash | 1,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231006 | Paid | Cash | 2,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231007 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 1,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231008 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 1,600,000.00\n- Purchase20231231009 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 1,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231012 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 1,500,000.00\n- Purchase20231231013 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 500,000.00\n- Purchase20231231014 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 1,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231010 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 500,000.00\n\n**Sum of purchases paid:**  \n1,500,000  \n+500,000  \n+1,600,000  \n+1,000,000  \n+2,000,000  \n+1,000,000  \n+1,600,000  \n+1,000,000  \n+1,500,000  \n+500,000  \n+1,000,000  \n+500,000  \n= 13,700,000\n\n#### Identify Fixed assets purchase Paid:\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 886,161.25\n- FixedAsset20231231001 (second, maybe a mistake or another asset) | Paid | Bank Transfer | 839,853.83\n- Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | (Entry, likely a rebalancing, not actual cash outflow) | 8,000,000.00\n\nAssume only actual paid lines, thus two lines:\n- 886,161.25 + 839,853.83 = **1,726,015.08**\n\n#### Identify expenses Paid (Sales/Admin/Financial):\n\nFilter all such lines:\n(Skip those not marked \"Paid\", and skip depreciation/interest receivable.)\n\nList and sum:\n- Expense20240101001 | Sales Expenses | 79,714.42\n- Expense20240102001 | Financial
