What do we need to find?\n\n\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" for the cash flow statement:  \nThis means:  \n**Ending Accounts Payable - Beginning Accounts Payable**\n\n## 2. What is \"Accounts Payable\"?\n\nAccounts payable represents purchases received but not yet paid for (i.e., UNPAID purchases with payment method \"Account Payable\").\n\n## 3. Find the ending and beginning balances\n\n**a) Beginning balance (as of 2023-12-31):**  \nLook for purchases on or before 2023-12-31 where payment/receipt_status = Unpaid and payment_method = Account Payable.\n\nFrom data provided, all \"Initial...\" records list only cash, bank, and fixed asset balances.  \nLetâ€™s look for UNPAID PURCHASES with \"Account Payable\" as payment_method, up to 2023-12-31.\n\nLet's scan the data for such entries:\n\n### Purchases up to 2023-12-31, unpaid/account payable:\n\n- Purchase20231231004 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 3,000,000.0 |...| Unpaid | Account Payable |...| S004 | Supplier 4 | P004 | ...| \n- Purchase20231231011 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 500,000.0  |...| Unpaid | Account Payable |...| S008 | Supplier 8 | P001 | ...| \n\n**All other purchases before/at 2023-12-31 are marked as \"Paid\".**\n\nSo, **Accounts Payable at 2023-12-31 = 3,000,000.0 + 500,000.0 = 3,500,000.0**\n\n**b) Ending balance (as of 2024-01-31):**  \nCheck for ALL UNPAID purchases with payment_method \"Account Payable\" (i.e., those same above lines) and see if any were settled (paid) in January OR if any new \"Account Payable\" purchases were added in January (none seen).\n\nLooking through the data, there are NO NEW purchases in January 2024 with status \"Unpaid\" or payment_method \"Account Payable\".\n\n**Did any of the previously unpaid (AP) get paid?**\n- Are there any purchases with those exact IDs marked as PAID (for those S004-P004 and S008-P001) in January? I do NOT see any (checked all purchase lines - they are either paid at the initial moment or still unpaid from 2023-12-31).\n\n**So, ending AP = same as beginning AP = 3,500,000.0**\n\n## 4. Compute (Increase) or Decrease\n\nIncrease/(Decrease) in Accounts Payable = Ending AP - Beginning AP = 3,500,000.0 - 3,500,000.0 = **0.00**\n\n# Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"0.00\"} }\n```\n",
