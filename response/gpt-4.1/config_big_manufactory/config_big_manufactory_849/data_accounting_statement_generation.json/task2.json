                        "content": "To solve the Bank Deposit values, follow these steps:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Identify Initial Bank Deposit\n\nFrom the data:\n- 2023-12-31: **Bank deposit** item with amount **15,000,000.0**  \n  (There is another line labelled \"Cash deposit\" for 5,000,000.0, but we only take \"Bank deposit\".)\n\n> **Initial Value: 15,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Calculate All Flows Affecting BANK Deposits\n\n### **Increases:**\n- Bank deposit: initial 15,000,000.00\n\n**From sales:**  \nMost sales show no payment method or payment status, **except when explicitly marked as \"Bank Transfer\" or paid to bank** â€“ but in the data, sales received in \"Cash\" don't impact bank directly.\n\n**From interest:**  \nInterest here is only receivable (not cash received), so does not change bank deposit.\n\n**From Cash to Bank Transfers:**  \nThere's no line for \"Cash to Bank Transfer\" in your sample data for this period.\n\n---\n\n### **Decreases:**\n**Paid by Bank Transfer or Bank Transfer method, or where purchases/fixed asset buy is \"Paid\" and payment method is \"Bank Transfer\".**\n\n#### **A. Purchases paid by Bank Transfer:**\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 1,500,000.00 *(Bank Transfer)*\n- Purchase20231231002:   500,000.00 *(Bank Transfer)*\n- Purchase20231231003: 1,600,000.00 *(Bank Transfer)*\n- Purchase20231231007: 1,000,000.00 *(Bank Transfer)*\n- Purchase20231231008: 1,600,000.00 *(Bank Transfer)*\n- Purchase20231231009: 1,000,000.00 *(Bank Transfer)*\n- Purchase20231231010:   500,000.00 *(Bank Transfer)*\n- Purchase20231231012: 1,500,000.00 *(Bank Transfer)*\n- Purchase20231231013:   500,000.00 *(Bank Transfer)*\n- Purchase20231231014: 1,000,000.00 *(Bank Transfer)*\n\n#### **B. Fixed Asset Purchases by Bank Transfer:**\n- FixedAsset20231231001:   886,161.25 *(Bank Transfer)*\n- FixedAsset20231231001:   839,853.83 *(Bank Transfer)*\n\n#### **C. Other Purchases/Fixed Asset Entries:**\n- The rest either has payment method \"Cash\" (does not affect bank deposit) or is \"Unpaid\"/\"Account Payable\" (does not affect bank now).\n\n#### **Total Bank Outflow Calculation:**\n\nLet's add:\n- Purchases by bank transfer:\n  - 1,500,000.00\n  -   500,000.00\n  - 1,600,000.00\n  - 1,000,000.00\n  - 1,600,000.00\n  - 1,000,000.00\n  -   500,000.00\n  - 1,500,000.00\n  -   500,000.00\n  - 1,000,000.00\n\n  Sum: \n  ```\n  1,500,000\n+   500,000 = 2,000,000\n+ 1,600,000 = 3,600,000\n+ 1,000,000 = 4,600,000\n+ 1,600,000 = 6,200,000\n+ 1,000,000 = 7,200,000\n+   500,000 = 7,700,000\n+ 1,500,000 = 9,200,000\n+   500,000 = 9,700,000\n+ 1,000,000 = 10,700,000\n  ```\n\n- Fixed Asset by bank transfer:\n  -   886,161.25\n  -   839,853.83\n\n  Add to above:\n  ```\n  10,700,000\n+   886,161.25 = 11,586,161.25\n+   839,853.83 = 12,426,015.08\n  ```\n\n#### **TOTAL Bank Outflow:**  \n**12,426,015.08**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Bank Deposit End Value\n\n### **Formula:**\n\nBank Deposit End = Initial + Inflows - Outflows\n\n- **Initial:**  15,000,000.00\n- **Inflows:**  0 (No cash to bank transfer, no sales into bank found)\n- **Outflows:** 12,426,015.08\n\nCalculation:\n\n**15,000,000.00 - 12,426,015.08 = 2,573,984.92**\n\n---\n\n## 4. Summary JSON\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"15000000.00\",\n  \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"2573984.92\"\n}}\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Verification (Check for possible inflow)**\n- All sales:  \n  - If \"Paid\" or payment method = \"Bank Transfer\", or \"Paid\" without payment method (possibly cash).\n  - In your data, only purchases and fixed asset items are explicit with \"Bank Transfer\" for bank outflows.\n  - No sales are specified as \"Paid\" with \"Bank Transfer\", so we do **not** add any inflow to bank deposit.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"15000000.00\",\n  \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"2573984.92\"\n}}\n```",
