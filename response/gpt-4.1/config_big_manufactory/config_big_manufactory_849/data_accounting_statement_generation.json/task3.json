                        "content": "Let's proceed step by step as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Inventory-related Transactions**\n\n- **Initial Inventory:** There is NO initial inventory mentioned (opening balances show only cash, bank, fixed assets).\n- **Inventory Purchases:** All \"Purchase\" records of products (Heavy Equipment A, B, C, D) are inventory purchases.\n- **Inventory Sales:** All \"Sale\" records of products (Heavy Equipment A, B, C, D) are inventory sales.\n- Ignore lines about expenses, fixed assets, depreciation, and interest receivables as they are not inventory.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Aggregate Purchases (IN to inventory)**\n\nEach Purchase line: quantity × unit price, summed for all products.\n\nLet’s sum each purchased product's quantities and costs:\n\n| date         | Product                  | qty | unit price | total         |\n|--------------|--------------------------|-----|------------|---------------|\n|2023-12-31    |P004 Heavy

|    500,000    |\n\nLet’s sum these up, grouping by product if helpful, but for inventory just the total will do.\n\nSum all “total” values from above:\n\n- 1,500,000 (D)\n-   500,000 (A)\n- 1,600,000 (B)\n- 3,000,000 (D)\n- 1,000,000 (C)\n- 2,000,000 (C)\n- 1,000,000 (A)\n- 1,600,000 (B)\n-   500,000 (A)\n-   500,000 (A)\n- 1,000,000 (C)\n- 1,500,000 (D)\n-   500,000 (A)\n\nLet’s add these:\n\n1,500,000  \n+   500,000 = 2,000,000  \n+ 1,600,000 = 3,600,000  \n+ 3,000,000 = 6,600,000  \n+ 1,000,000 = 7,600,000  \n+ 2,000,000 = 9,600,000  \n+ 1,000,000 =10,600,000  \n+ 1,600,000 =12,200,000  \n+   500,000 =12,700,000  \n+   500,000 =13,200,000  \n+ 1,000,000 =14,200,000  \n+ 1,500,000 =15,700,000  \n+   500,000 =16,200,000\n\n**Total purchases = 16,200,000**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Aggregate Sales (OUT of inventory, at cost)**\n\nFor each Sale, we need to subtract the \"cost_amount\" of that unit(s) from inventory.\n- Use field \"cost_amount\" (NOT sale price).\n- Sum all \"cost_amount\" from all Sales lines.\n\nLet’s list each Sale record’s \"cost_amount\":\n\n- 2024-01-06   | P001 | 1 | cost_amount: 500,000.0\n- 2024-01-08   | P004 | 1 | 1,500,000.0\n- 2024-01-11   | P002 | 1 | 800,000.0\n- 2024-01-14   | P001 | 1 | 500,000.0\n- 2024-01-19   | P003 | 1 | 1,000,000.0\n- 2024-01-22   | P001 | 1 | 500,000.0\n- 2024-01-23   | P002 | 1 | 800,000.0\n- 2024-01-24   | P001 | 1 | 500,000.0\n- 2024-01-25   | P004 | 1 | 1,500,000.0\n- 2024-01-26   | P001 | 1 | 500,000.0\n- 2024-01-30   | P003 | 1 | 1,000,000.0\n- 2024-01-31   | P001 | 1 | 500,000.0\n- 2024-02-02   | P001 | 1 | 500,000.0\n- 2024-02-04   | P004 | 1 | 1,500,000.0\n\nNow, let’s add up all the cost_amounts:\n\n- 500,000\n- 1,500,000\n-   800,000\n-   500,000\n- 1,000,000\n-   500,000\n-   800,000\n-   500,000\n- 1,500,000\n-   500,000\n- 1,000,000\n-   500,000\n-   500,000\n- 1,500,000\n\nLet’s total it up:\n\n500,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 2,000,000  \n+   800,000 = 2,800,000  \n+   500,000 = 3,300,000  \n+ 1,000,000 = 4,300,000  \n+   500,000 = 4,800,000  \n+   800,000 = 5,600,000  \n+   500,000 = 6,100,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 7,600,000  \n+   500,000 = 8,100,000  \n+ 1,000,000 = 9,100,000  \n+   500,000 = 9,600,000  \n+   500,000 =10,100,000  \n+ 1,500,000 =11,600,000\n\nTotal sales out at cost: **11,600,000**\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Initial Inventory Value**\n\nAs established, there is **0.00** opening inventory in the balance sheet.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Inventory End Value Calculation**\n\nInventory at end = Initial Inventory  \n+ Purchases  \n- Cost of inventory sold (cost_amount from sales)\n\nSo,\n\nEnd Inventory = 0  \n+ 16,200,000  \n- 11,600,000  \n= 4,600,000\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Check for possible double-counting or missing lines\n\nLet's check the count of purchases and sales for each product:\n\n### Purchases of Each Product (quantities):\n\n- **P001 Heavy Equipment A:** 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 units purchased\n- **P002 Heavy Equipment B:** 2 + 2 = 4 units purchased\n- **P003 Heavy Equipment C:** 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 5 units purchased\n- **P004 Heavy Equipment D:** 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 units purchased\nAdd up each's units on \"Purchase\" lines, seems fine.\n\n### Sales of Each Product (quantities):\n\nLook at each \"Sale\" line, how many times each sold:\n\nCount units (from each sale line):\n\n- **P001:** 1 (2024-01-06) +1 (2024-01-14) +1 (2024-01-22) +1 (2024-01-24) +1 (2024-01-26) +1 (2024-01-31) +1 (2024-02-02) = **7 units sold**\n- **P002:** 1 (2024-01-11) +1 (2024-01-23) = **2 units sold**\n- **P003:** 1 (2024-01-19) +1 (2024-01-30) = **2 units sold**\n- **P004:** 1 (2024-01-08) +1 (2024-01-25) +1 (2024-02-04) = **3 units sold**\n\nFrom purchases above, were:\n\n- P001: 9 in, 7 out → 2 remain\n- P002: 4 in, 2 out → 2 remain\n- P003: 5 in, 2 out → 3 remain\n- P004: 4 in, 3 out → 1 remain\n\nCheck their cost per unit to double check ending value:\n\n- P001 cost: most at 500,000\n- P002: 800,000\n- P003: 1,000,000\n- P004: 1,500,000\n\nSo:\n\n- P001: 2 remain × 500,000 = 1,000,000\n- P002: 2 remain × 800,000 = 1,600,000\n- P003: 3 remain × 1,000,000 = 3,000,000\n- P004: 1 remain × 1,500,000 = 1,500,000\n\nSum: 1,000,000 + 1,600,000 + 3,000,000 + 1,500,000 = **7,100,000**\n\nBut this’s **higher** than previous calculation. Why? Because the \"cost_amount\" in the sales lines doesn't fit the quantity counts; the \"cost_amount\" always matches one unit, but some products had more units purchased, less units sold.\n\nWait: Let's redo by focusing on unit quantities, then cost per unit, instead of adding all purchases then subtracting the cost of goods sold (as some goods may remain in stock).\n\nLet's tabulate:\n\n### Inventory movement per product\n\n#### P001 Heavy Equipment A\n- Purchases: 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 +1 +1 +1 = **9 units** (all at 500,000/unit)\n- Sales: 1 (2024-01-06), 1 (2024-01-14), 1 (2024-01-22), 1 (2024-01-24), 1 (2024-01-26), 1 (2024-01-31), 1 (2024-02-02) = **7 units**\n- Remaining: 2 units × 500,000 = **1,000,000**\n\n#### P002 Heavy Equipment B\n- Purchases: 2 + 2 = **4 units** (all at 800,000/unit)\n- Sales: 1 (2024-01-11), 1 (2024-01-23) = **2 units**\n- Remaining: 2 units × 800,000 = **1,600,000**\n\n#### P003 Heavy Equipment C\n- Purchases: 1 + 2 + 1 +1 = **5 units** (all at 1,000,000/unit)\n- Sales: 1 (2024-01-19), 1 (2024-01-30) = **2 units**\n- Remaining: 3 units × 1,000,000 = **3,000,000**\n\n#### P004 Heavy Equipment D\n- Purchases: 1 + 2 + 1 = **4 units** (all at 1,500,000/unit)\n- Sales: 1 (2024-01-08), 1 (2024-01-25), 1 (2024-02-04) = **3 units**\n- Remaining: 1 unit × 1,500,000 = **1,500,000**\n\nTotal remaining inventory value:  \n1,000,000 + 1,600,000 + 3,000,000 + 1,500,000 = **7,100,000**\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Correction**\n\nEarlier, I had **4,600,000** simply doing totals. But correct ending inventory is the value of units remaining: **7,100,000**. The error was assuming no quantity overlap instead of tracking units. So, **track unit flows, not just value**.\n\n**Step 8: Final Answer**\n\n- **Opening inventory:** 0.00\n- **Ending inventory:** 7,100,000.00\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Inventory End Value\": \"7100000.00\"} }\n```",
