START – Initial assets: 28,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n#### **B. Sum up net impact of all transactions**\n\n##### **1. Fixed Asset Purchases (`FixedAsset*`)**\n- 886,161.25\n- 839,853.83\n\n**Both are \"Paid\" via Bank Transfer.**  \n- Bank deposit asset decreases, fixed asset increases => total assets unchanged.\n\n##### **2. Purchases (`Purchase*`)**\n\n| Amount   | Paid/Unpaid       |\n|----------|-------------------|\n|1,500,000 | Paid              |\n|  500,000 | Paid              |\n|1,600,000 | Paid              |\n|3,000,000 | Unpaid (Account Payable)|\n|1,000,000 | Paid              |\n|2,000,000 | Paid              |\n|1,000,000 | Paid              |\n|1,600,000 | Paid              |\n|1,000,000 | Paid              |\n|  500,000 | Paid              |\n|  500,000 | Paid              |\n|1,500,000 | Paid              |\n|  500,000 | Paid              |\n|1,000,000 | Paid              |\n\n> The **only unpaid purchase** is 3,000,000 (Account Payable).\n\nSo asset increases 3,000,000, matched by liability (accounts payable) increase.\n\n##### **3. Purchases marked Paid**\nAll other purchases simply reduce cash/bank and increase inventory/fixed asset; no net effect on total assets.\n\n##### **4. Purchases marked Unpaid**\n- 3,000,000.00 increases asset (inventory/fixed asset), increases liability (AP) by same.\n\nAlso:\n- \"Purchase20231231011\" for 500,000 is \"Unpaid\" – also increases both assets and AP by 500,000.\n\n> Total **Unpaid Purchases** = 3,000,000 + 500,000 = **3,500,000.00**\n\n---\n\n##### **5. Fixed Assets (Depreciation)**\n- 45,745.88  (2024-01-01)\n- 60,147.44  (2024-02-01)\n**Total depreciation = 45,745.88 + 60,147.44 = 105,893.32**\n\nThis reduces assets.\n\n---\n\n##### **6.
