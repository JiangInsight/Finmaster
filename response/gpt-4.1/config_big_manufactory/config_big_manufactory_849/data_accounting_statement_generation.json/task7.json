                        "content": "Let's solve step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Find the Initial and Ending balances for “Fixed Assets”**\n\n### 1. Initial Fixed Assets\nFrom the data:\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 8000000.0 | 8000000.0 |\n\nSo,  \n**Initial Fixed Assets = 8,000,000.0**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Find all fixed assets transactions during the period:\n\nOnly transactions that actually affect \"fixed assets\" on the balance sheet are:\n- Purchases of fixed assets (and not purchases of inventory, which is for resale goods). We must only add items that are for long-term use (typically indicated by an \"asset_name\", \"asset_type\", or a fixed asset purchase record).\n- Depreciation (which reduces the carrying value of fixed assets).\n\n#### 2.1) Additions to Fixed Assets\n\nFrom the data, these rows represent fixed assets purchases:\n\n1. | FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 886161.25 | 886161.25 | ... | Heavy Machinery4 | Heavy Machinery |\n2. | FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 839853.83 | 839853.83 | ... | Production Line Equipment5 | Production Line Equipment |\n\nSum of fixed asset purchases:\n- 886,161.25 (Heavy Machinery)\n- 839,853.83 (Production Line Equipment)\n\nSum: 886,161.25 + 839,853.83 = **1,726,015.08**\n\n#### 2.2) Sales/Disposals of Fixed Assets\n\nLook for sales with asset names matching purchased fixed assets (e.g., \"Heavy Equipment A\", etc.). In this dataset, sales with:\n- | SaleYYYY... | Sale | ... | P001 | Heavy Equipment A | ... |\n- | SaleYYYY... | Sale | ... | P003 | Heavy Equipment C | ... |\n- | SaleYYYY... | Sale | ... | P004 | Heavy Equipment D | ... |\n- | SaleYYYY... | Sale | ... | P002 | Heavy Equipment B | ... |\n\nThese are all sales of **fixed assets**.\n\nFor each such sale, we need to deduct the *cost_amount* from fixed assets, because these are disposals and must be removed from the balance sheet at their original cost.\n\nLet's sum up the cost_amount for all sales of heavy equipment (fixed assets):\n\n#### List all sale entries with cost_amount\n\n1. **Sale20240106004** - P001 Heavy Equipment A: cost_amount=500000.0  \n2. **Sale20240108006** - P004 Heavy Equipment D: cost_amount=1500000.0  \n3. **Sale20240111008** - P002 Heavy Equipment B: cost_amount=800000.0  \n4. **Sale20240114010** - P001 Heavy Equipment A: cost_amount=500000.0  \n5. **Sale20240119016** - P003 Heavy Equipment C: cost_amount=1000000.0  \n6. **Sale20240122019** - P001 Heavy Equipment A: cost_amount=500000.0  \n7. **Sale20240123021** - P002 Heavy Equipment B: cost_amount=800000.0  \n8. **Sale20240124022** - P001 Heavy Equipment A: cost_amount=500000.0  \n9. **Sale20240125024** - P004 Heavy Equipment D: cost_amount=1500000.0  \n10. **Sale20240126025** - P001 Heavy Equipment A: cost_amount=500000.0  \n11. **Sale20240129031** - (Not in data)\n12. **Sale20240130031** - P003 Heavy Equipment C: cost_amount=1000000.0  \n13. **Sale20240131033** - P001 Heavy Equipment A: cost_amount=500000.0  \n14. **Sale20240202035** - P001 Heavy Equipment A: cost_amount=500000.0  \n15. **Sale20240204038** - P004 Heavy Equipment D: cost_amount=1500000.0  \n\nLet’s carefully go through and list the cost amounts:\n\n- 500,000.0  (Sale20240106004, Heavy Equipment A)\n- 1,500,000.0 (Sale20240108006, Heavy Equipment D)\n- 800,000.0  (Sale20240111008, Heavy Equipment B)\n- 500,000.0  (Sale20240114010, Heavy Equipment A)\n- 1,000,000.0 (Sale20240119016, Heavy Equipment C)\n- 500,000.0  (Sale20240122019, Heavy Equipment A)\n- 800,000.0  (Sale20240123021, Heavy Equipment B)\n- 500,000.0  (Sale20240124022, Heavy Equipment A)\n- 1,500,000.0 (Sale20240125024, Heavy Equipment D)\n- 500,000.0  (Sale20240126025, Heavy Equipment A)\n- 1,000,000.0 (Sale20240129031, not in data, skip, check below)\n- 1,000,000.0 (Sale20240130031, Heavy Equipment C)\n- 500,000.0  (Sale20240131033, Heavy Equipment A)\n- 500,000.0  (Sale20240202035, Heavy Equipment A)\n- 1,500,000.0 (Sale20240204038, Heavy Equipment D)\n\n**Total cost_amount to deduct:**\nLet’s sum:\n\n1. 500,000.0\n2. +1,500,000.0 = 2,000,000.0\n3. +800,000.0 = 2,800,000.0\n4. +500,000.0 = 3,300,000.0\n5. +1,000,000.0 = 4,300,000.0\n6. +500,000.0 = 4,800,000.0\n7. +800,000.0 = 5,600,000.0\n8. +500,000.0 = 6,100,000.0\n9. +1,500,000.0 = 7,600,000.0\n10. +500,000.0 = 8,100,000.0\n11.

Determine if other transactions affect the asset balance\nPurchases of items like \"Heavy Equipment\" in 'Purchase' records are also fixed assets (since they're not inventory for resale in this context, and heavy equipment is typical capitalized). So all \"Purchase\" transactions with product_name indicating a fixed asset (e.g., Heavy Equipment A/B/C/D) are new fixed assets.\n\nLet's list all such purchases:\n\n- | Purchase20231231001 | Heavy Equipment D | 1.0 | 1,500,000.0\n- | Purchase20231231002 | Heavy Equipment A | 1.0 | 500,000.0\n- | Purchase20231231003 | Heavy Equipment B | 2.0 | 1,600,000.0\n- | Purchase20231231004 | Heavy Equipment D | 2.0 | 3,000,000.0\n- | Purchase20231231005 | Heavy Equipment C | 1.0 | 1,000,000.0\n- | Purchase20231231006 | Heavy Equipment C | 2.0 | 2,000,000.0\n- | Purchase20231231007 | Heavy Equipment A | 2.0 | 1,000,000.0\n- | Purchase20231231008 | Heavy Equipment B | 2.0 | 1,600,000.0\n- | Purchase20231231009 | Heavy Equipment A | 2.0 | 1,000,000.0\n- | Purchase20231231010 | Heavy Equipment A | 1.0 | 500,000.0\n- | Purchase20231231011 | Heavy Equipment A | 1.0 | 500,000.0\n- | Purchase20231231012 | Heavy Equipment D | 1.0 | 1,500,000.0\n- | Purchase20231231013 | Heavy Equipment A | 1.0 | 500,000.0\n- | Purchase20231231014 | Heavy Equipment C | 1.0 | 1,000,000.0\n\nSo, among the purchases (excluding those already included as “FixedAsset” purchases):\n\nList the amounts:\n\n1,500,000.0 \\\n+ 500,000.0 = 2,000,000.0 \\\n+ 1,600,000.0 = 3,600,000.0 \\\n+ 3,000,000.0 = 6,600,000.0 \\\n+ 1,000,000.0 = 7,600,000.0 \\\n+ 2,000,000.0 = 9,600,000.0 \\\n+ 1,000,000.0 = 10,600,000.0 \\\n+ 1,600,000.0 = 12,200,000.0 \\\n+ 1,000,000.0 = 13,200,000.0 \\\n+ 500,000.0 = 13,700,000.0 \\\n+ 500,000.0 = 14,200,000.0 \\\n+ 1,500,000.0 = 15,700,000.0 \\\n+ 500,000.0 = 16,200,000.0 \\\n+ 1,000,000.0 = 17,200,000.0\n\n**Total purchases of fixed asset \"Heavy Equipment\" via 'Purchase' records = 17,200,000.0**\n\nNow, we need to check the two dedicated \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" records from earlier. Their amounts and \"asset_name\" columns (Heavy Machinery4 and Production Line Equipment5) are differ from above and are not repeated.\n\nThus **add**:\n- \"FixedAsset20231231001\" 886,161.25\n- \"FixedAsset20231231001\" 839,853.83\n\nSo, **Total additions to fixed assets = 17,200,000.0 + 886,161.25 + 839,853.83 = 18,926,015.08**\n\n---\n\n### 4. Calculation: Final Fixed Assets\n\n**Fixed Assets End Value = Initial + Additions – Disposals – Depreciation**\n\nPlug values:\n\n- Initial: 8,000,000.0\n- Additions: 18,926,015.08\n- Disposals: 11,600,000.0\n- Depreciation: 105,893.32\n\nFinal Value = 8,000,000.0 \\\n+ 18,926,015.08 \\\n– 11,600,000.0 \\\n– 105,893.32\n\n**Final Value Calculation:**\n\n8,000,000.0 + 18,926,015.08 = 26,926,015.08\n\n26,926,015.08 – 11,600,000.0 = 15,326,015.08\n\n15,326,015.08 – 105,893.32 = **15,220,121.76**\n\n---\n\n### 5. Round to Two Decimal Places\n\nInitial Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.00  \nEnd Fixed Assets: 15,220,121.76\n\n---\n\n## Final Solution\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"15220121.76\"} }\n```\n",
