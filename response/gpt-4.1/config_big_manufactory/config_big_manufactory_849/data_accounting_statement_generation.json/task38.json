                        "content": "Let's solve step-by-step.\n\n## Step 1: Identify receivables-related sales\nIn the cash flow statement, \"accounts receivable\" is affected by sales on account (credit sales) and cash collections from customers on account. \n- When sales are made on account, accounts receivable increases.\n- When cash is collected from earlier sales (not in this data), accounts receivable decreases.\n\nIn this dataset, we look for all sales with `payment/receipt_status = Unpaid` and/or `receive_method = Account Receivable` (some might just lack the field filled in, but the ones with \"Paid\" and explicit \"Cash\" are definitely not on account, so we can ignore them).\n- We also ignore interest receivables: those go to interest receivable account (not accounts receivable).\n- Only “Sale” items with \"Unpaid\" or \"receive_method=Account Receivable\" count as increases in A/R.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate INCREASES in A/R\n### Review all Sales Lines for Credit Sales\n\nLet's enumerate all \"Sale\" lines with UNPAID or RECEIVE_METHOD = \"Account Receivable\" (sorted by date):\n\n#### 2024-01-11 | Sale20240111008 | 1151336.63 | Unpaid | receive_method=Account Receviable\n#### 2024-01-14 | Sale20240114010 | 693546.26 | Unpaid | receive_method=Account Receviable\n#### 2024-01-23 | Sale20240123021 | 1076054.24 | Unpaid | receive_method=Account Receviable\n#### 2024-01-31 | Sale20240131033 | 717864.25 | Unpaid | receive_method=Account Receviable\n#### 2024-02-02 | Sale20240202035 | 660969.7 | Unpaid | receive_method=Account Receviable\n#### 2024-02-04 | Sale20240204038 | 2109215.99 | Unpaid | receive_method=Account Receviable\n\n(There are also some earlier sales, continue looking...)\n\n\nLet's check for any with \"Paid\" or paid method, so that we don't confuse cash/credit. But as per data above, all other sales have \"Paid\"/cash. \"Unpaid\" or explicit account receivable only in above. If there are other sales with \"Unpaid\" status and not clearly offset by cash, they also count.\n\nBut in this dataset, \"Paid\" ones use \"Cash\" or Bank, with payment/receipt_status \"Paid\".\n\nSo, sum credit sales (accounts receivable increases):\n\n- 2024-01-11: 1,151,336.63\n- 2024-01-14:   693,546.26\n- 2024-01-23: 1,076,054.24\n- 2024-01-31:   717,864.25\n- 2024-02-02:   660,969.70\n- 2024-02-04: 2,109,215.99\n\nTotal increase = \n1,151,336.63\n+   693,546.26\n+ 1,076,054.24\n+   717,864.25\n+   660,969.70\n+ 2,109,215.99\n= **6,409,987.07**\n\n## Step 3: Calculate DECREASES in A/R\nUsually, decrease comes from collections of prior receivables during the period. In this dataset, I do **not** see explicit \"cash received from accounts receivable\" or \"collections from customers\" for sales that were previously on account, so there are **no decreases in A/R** observed here. (If there was a \"collection from customer\" not matched to a new sale, that would be a decrease.)\n\n## Step 4: Net Change in Accounts Receivable\nChange = AR ending - AR beginning  \nSince there is no opening AR (none in initial entries, just cash, bank, fixed assets), and no collections, the **entire sum is an increase in AR**.\n\n## Step 5: Format for Cash Flow Statement\nIn cash flow statement, increases in accounts receivable is **subtracted** in indirect method, so it is shown as a **negative number**.\n\n## Step 6: Format Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-6409987.07\"} }\n```\n\n## Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-6409987.07\"} }\n```",
