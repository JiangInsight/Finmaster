Calculating Final Cash on Hand\n\n**Initial Cash**:            5,000,000.00  \n**+ Sales Inflows**:         9,979,749.26  \n**- Expenses/Purchases**:   (5,596,154.70)  \n**----------------------**   ===============\n\nBut, we missed something:\n- Purchases paid by other means (e.g., bank transfer) **do not** affect cash on hand—they are excluded.\n- Purchases paid by cash: only 2,000,000.0 and 1,000,000.0 are paid by cash, others use bank transfer.\n- All other purchases, expenses, etc., unless noted as \"Paid, Cash\", should not be included.\n\nSo the earlier sum is correct.\n\n## 6. Compute Final Value\n\n**Initial cash on hand**:      5,000,000.00  \n**Total cash inflows (Sales)**: 9,979,749.26  \n**Total cash outflows**:      (5,596,154.70)  \n\n**Ending cash = 5,000,000.00 + 9,979,749.26 - 5,596,154.70 = 9,383,594.56**\n\n---\n\n### Cross-check for errors\n\nBut this is not correct. Let's double-check the cash flow logic:\n\n- **Initial cash = 5,000,000.00**\n- **Add only sales that bring cash into on hand** (i.e., \"receive_method=Cash\").\n- **Subtract only items paid by cash** (expenses, purchases with \"Paid, Cash\"), as others are done by bank transfer.\n\nRechecking the cash sales just above (summing the cash received):\n\n9,979,749.26\n\nCash outflows: All listed earlier, summed to 5,596,154.70\n\nSo the calculation is:\n5,000,000.00  \n+ 9,979,749.26  \n- 5,596,154.70  \n= **9,383,594.56**\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Final Solution**:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"5,000,000.00\",\n  \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"9,383,594.56\"\n}}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Short Reasoning Summary\n- Start with initial cash deposit (\"Cash deposit\").\n- Add all sales with receive_method=Cash.\n- Subtract all expense and purchase transactions with Paid+Cash.\n- Purchases/expenses by bank transfer, and unpaid items, do not affect cash on hand.\n- No cash to bank transfers in data, so none to consider.\n- Simple sum as above.\n",
