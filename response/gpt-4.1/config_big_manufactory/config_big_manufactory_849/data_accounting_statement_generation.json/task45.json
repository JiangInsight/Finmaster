                        "content": "Let's break down the calculation step by step, per the rules for \"Net Cash Flows from Investing Activities\" in a cash flow statement.\n\n## 1. Definition\n\nInvesting activities include **cash flows related to the acquisition and disposal of fixed assets**, investments and other long-term assets. For this dataset, we primarily look for:\n- **Fixed asset purchases** (outflows, negative).\n- **Fixed asset sales/disposals** (inflows, positive).\n\n**Purchases** of products for resale (e.g., \"Heavy Equipment A\") are not fixed asset investments unless for own use, but usually are inventories (operating activity). But here, items labelled \"Fixed Asset Purchase\" and similar are for investment. \n\nHowever, any entry indicating own-use asset (not product inventory), such as \"Fixed Asset Purchase\", goes into investing.\n\nCash flows for fixed asset sales (\"Sale\" of own-use assets—see if these are asset sales, not inventory) are **inflows**.\n\n## 2. Identify all investing cash flows\n\n### Outflows (Cash out for investment)\n\n#### Explicitly tagged as Asset Purchases:\n- | type                    | amount      | payment_status |\n- |------------------------|-------------|---------------|\n- Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets          | 8000000.0   |                |\n- FixedAsset20231231001    | 886161.25   | Paid          |\n- FixedAsset20231231001    | 839853.83   | Paid          |\n\n#### Purchases of \"Heavy Equipment A, B, C, D\":\n\nLook at purchases (type: Purchase) where product is equipment and it's for **company use**. If bought for resale (i.e., also appears as sold), should be COGS (operating), but let's stick to only explicitly marked investment, or if product/asset name matches own-use.  \nThe only clearly qualifying entries for the investing cash flows are **fixed asset purchase** type; the rest are inventory.\n\nSo, investing outflows:\n- FixedAsset20231231001: 886161.25 (Heavy Machinery)\n- FixedAsset20231231001: 839853.83 (Production Line Equipment)\n- [Initial balance] Fixed Assets: 8000000.0 (Initial balance, likely opening balance of assets—**do NOT count as a flow in period**)\n    - Opening balances are not actual inflows/outflows in the current period. Only purchases/sales during the period count.\n    - So ignore opening balance.\n\n#### Any other?\nNo other lines with \"Fixed Asset Purchase\" or similar.\n\n### Inflows (Asset sales/disposals)\n\nLook for sales of fixed assets, i.e., sale of equipment/production lines etc. Check \"Sale\" entries where the product is capital equipment.\n\n**Sale of own-use assets:**\n- Sale20240106004: Sale | 2024-01-06 | 748087.14 | Product: Heavy Equipment A | \"Sale\" | Paid\n- Sale20240108006: Sale | 2024-01-08 | 2146535.22 | Product: Heavy Equipment D | \"Sale\" | Paid\n- Sale20240111008: Sale | 2024-01-11 | 1151336.63 | Product: Heavy Equipment B | \"Sale\" | Unpaid (let's only include the paid portion for cash flow statement)\n- Sale20240114010: Sale | 2024-01-14 | 693546.26 | Heavy Equipment A | Unpaid\n- Sale20240119016: Sale | 2024-01-19 | 1348068.18 | Heavy Equipment C | Paid\n- Sale20240122019: Sale | 2024-01-22 | 694657.72 | Heavy Equipment A | Paid\n- Sale20240123021: Sale | 2024-01-23 | 1076054.24 | Heavy Equipment B | Unpaid\n- Sale20240124022: Sale | 2024-01-24 | 677364.56 | Heavy Equipment A | Paid\n- Sale20240125024: Sale | 2024-01-25 | 2210585.18 | Heavy Equipment D | Paid\n- Sale20240126025: Sale | 2024-01-26 | 661580.66 | Heavy Equipment A | Paid\n- Sale20240130031: Sale | 2024-01-30 | 1492870.6 | Heavy Equipment C | Paid\n- Sale20240131033: Sale | 2024-01-31 | 717864.25 | Heavy Equipment A | Unpaid\n- Sale20240202035: Sale | 2024-02-02 | 660969.7 | Heavy Equipment A | Unpaid\n- Sale20240204038: Sale | 2024-02-04 | 2109215.99 | Heavy Equipment D | Unpaid\n\n#### Cash basis: Only include PAID sales\n\nFrom above, only those with payment/receipt_status == Paid are included as inflow in investing activities (unpaid [credit] sales do not generate cash in period).\n\n**PAID Sales total:**\n- 748087.14 (Sale20240106004)\n- 2146535.22 (Sale20240108006)\n- 1348068.18 (Sale20240119016)\n- 694657.72 (Sale20240122019)\n- 677364.56 (Sale20240124022)\n- 2210585.18 (Sale20240125024)\n- 661580.66 (Sale20240126025)\n- 1492870.6 (Sale20240130031)\n\nSum:\n= 748087.14  \n+ 2146535.22  \n+ 1348068.18  \n+ 694657.72  \n+ 677364.56  \n+ 2210585.18  \n+ 661580.66  \n+ 1492870.6  \n\nLet's sum:\n- 748087.14 + 2146535.22 = 2894622.36\n- + 1348068.18 = 4242690.54\n- + 694657.72 = 4937348.26\n- + 677364.56 = 5614712.82\n- + 2210585.18 = 7825298.00\n- + 661580.66 = 8486878.66\n- + 1492870.6 = 9979749.26\n\n**Total Cash Inflows from Paid Sales of Fixed Assets: 9,979,749.26**\n\n### Outflows (summed above as only FixedAsset Purchases)\n- 886,161.25 (Heavy Machinery)\n- 839,853.83 (Production Line Equipment)\n\n**Total Cash Outflows from Investing: 886,161.25 + 839,853.83 = 1,726,015.08**\n\nLets check for other (non-explicit) cash flows, e.g., items labelled \"Purchase\" with product names (\"Heavy Equipment...\") as company use (not resale), but unless clearly for investment (own-use), **do not count** as per above logic.\n\n#### Cross-check:\nAll other \"Purchase\" lines (\"Purchase\" type) are for heavy equipment but, given frequent sales with matching product names, likely inventory for resale (operating, not investment cash flow).\n\n## 3. Final Calculation\n\nNet Cash Flows from Investing Activities = Inflows (asset sales) - Outflows (asset purchases)\n\n= 9,979,749.26 (cash inflows)\n– 1,726,015.08 (cash outflows)\n= **8,253,734.18**\n\n## 4.
