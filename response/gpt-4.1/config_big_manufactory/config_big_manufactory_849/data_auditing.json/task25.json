Initial20231231001 records (first 3 rows):**\n- All three share the same id, bolding the same transaction split into three entries (\"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\").\n- The invoice, a typically reliable field, consistently says: \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Cash deposit, totaling $3000000.00.\", \"Bank deposit, totaling $5000000.00\", and \"Fixed Assets, totaling $5000000.00\".\n- The corresponding recorded_amounts are 5,000,000; 15,000,000; 8,000,000 â€“ but none match the invoice text.\n- Based on the invoice narrative (and as seen in the samples section, which had similar occurrences), we should match the amount to the invoice text: \n    - For Cash deposit: $3,000,000.00 (not $5,000,000)\n    - For Bank deposit: $5,000,000.00 (not $15,000,000)\n    - For Fixed Assets: $5,000,000.00 (not $8,000,000)\n- These rows likely contain an internal error where amounts were misallocated or mistyped.\n- In each, the most reliable value is the amount in the invoice text.\n\n**2. Purchase20231231008:**\n- The recorded_type is Depreciation, but the invoice describes \"an invoice was issued for a Purchase, consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $800000.00, totaling $1,600,000.00.\"\n- The recorded_date is \"2024-01-29\", but the invoice refers to \"On December 31, 2023\".\n- The recorded_unit_price is \"779682.53\", but per the invoice and amount/quantity this should be $800,000.00.\n- Therefore, these fields are clearly inconsistent with the more reliable invoice description.\n\n**Result:** These are the main inconsistencies found in your table based on internal contradiction of fields and prioritizing invoices as ground truth.",
