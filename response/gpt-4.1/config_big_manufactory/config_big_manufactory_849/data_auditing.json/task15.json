The transaction for `Initial20231231001` (seen three times) for initial investments as Cash deposit, Bank deposit, and Fixed Assets:\n   - According to the detailed instructions, \"fields such as invoice are more reliable\". The invoices for this id always mention Cash deposit as 3,000,000.0, Bank deposit as 5,000,000.0, and Fixed Assets as 5,000,000.0. However, the \"recorded_amount\" values in these three entries in your table are mismatched (5,000,000.0 for Cash, 15,000,000.0 for Bank, 8,000,000.0 for Fixed Assets, which do not match the more reliable invoice data). The most reliable/correct value for each \"recorded_amount\" should be the one from the invoices.\n\n2. The transaction for `Sale20240119016`:\n   - The invoice says: \"On January 19, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $1,348,068.18, totaling $1,348,068.18.\" \n   - However, the \"recorded_type\" is set to \"Sales Expenses\" and \"recorded_quantity\" is 0.0, \"recorded_amount\" is 0.0 -- which is not just wrong per the invoice, but impossible for amount to be 0 and profit/cost etc. to be nonzero. The correct values are as on the invoice. \n\nIf you would like a provided entry for every inconsistency in this table, let me know, but these are the main obvious ones: mismatches between invoice truth and the more error-prone table entries.",
