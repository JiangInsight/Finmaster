The cost amount for this transaction was $1,500,000.00, with a tax amount of $105,460.80, leading to a total amount due of $2,003,755.19. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n    - **Recorded data:** quantity: 0.0, unit price: 2,321,733.08, amount: 0.0, tax: 2,140,290.64.\n    - All these are fundamentally inconsistent with the invoice's details.\n    - **Best estimate correct values:** quantity 1.0, unit price $2,109,215.99, tax $105,460.80, amount $2,109,215.99\n\n**No other major inconsistencies observed in the provided transaction listing versus the invoice text, as all other values match or missing fields are unfilled. If more mismatches were to be found, they would be reported here in the same output json list style.**",
