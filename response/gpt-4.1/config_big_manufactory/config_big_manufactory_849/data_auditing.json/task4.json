Transaction id: `FixedAsset20231231001`.\n2. The invoice states: \"The payment_method of this transaction was bank transfer, and this transaction was paid. The supplier ID is S001, and the supplier name is Supplier 1.\"\n3. In the table, the `recorded_payment_method` is \"Account Payable\".\n4. This conflicts with the more reliable invoice which says \"Bank Transfer\".\n5. All other fields match the invoice and do not have inconsistencies.\n6. Therefore, the mistake is in the payment method only.\n7. No values for quantity, price, etc. in this row, so those fields are not relevant.\n8. Thus, fill only the `payment_method` as incorrect. All others as null. Provide the correct value as per the invoice: \"Bank Transfer\".",
