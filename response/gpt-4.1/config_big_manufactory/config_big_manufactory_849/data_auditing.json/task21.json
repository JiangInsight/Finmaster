According to the invoice text for the first row, \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Cash deposit, totaling $5000000.00.\" However, the recorded_type in this row is \"Cash deposit\" (with amount 5000000.0), whereas in the next with the same ID but for \"Bank deposit\", the recorded_amount is 15000000.0, but the invoice states $15000000.00. This suggests the second row should be Bank deposit, $15000000.00, and the first row mistakenly labels Bank deposit as Cash deposit. The amount and category should match the invoice, so the recorded_type for the first row should be \"Bank deposit\". \n\nIf you want all inconsistencies:  \n- Row 1: category should be \"Bank deposit\", amount \"$5000000.00\" (matches invoice value).\n- Row 2: category is correct \"Bank deposit\", amount \"$15000000.00\" (matches invoice).\n- Row 3: correct \"Fixed Assets\" \"$8000000.00\".\n\nIf more are needed, please clarify, but this directly follows the example format for a single major error. If you need all found, let me know!",
