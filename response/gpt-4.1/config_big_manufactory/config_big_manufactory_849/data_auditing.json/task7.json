There is clear internal inconsistency among the three \"Initial20231231001\" entries, all with the same id but different types and amounts. From the invoice narrative, the amounts for each type should be:\n   - Cash deposit: $5,000,000 \n   - Bank deposit: $15,000,000 \n   - Fixed Assets: $8,000,000\n   But the data table switches the amounts of cash and bank deposit from what the invoice says. So, their categories are mismatched regarding the amounts.\n2. For \"Sale20240125024\", the \"Recorded receive_method\" is \"Interest receivable\" but invoice narrative and the payment/receipt status show it's a cash transaction. The best estimate for correction is that the receive_method should be \"Cash\".\n\nThese are the notable *internal* inconsistencies detected based on the reliable invoice description and cross-field logical checks. All other rows are self-consistent within the invoice summary.",
