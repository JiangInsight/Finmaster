Initial20231231001: Cash deposit \n- There are three entries for this ID in the sample: Cash deposit (should be $3,000,000.00), Bank deposit (should be $5,000,000.00) and Fixed Assets (should be $5,000,000.00).\n- In the \"problem\", the amounts are $5,000,000.00 (Cash deposit), $15,000,000.00 (Bank deposit), and $8,000,000.00 (Fixed Assets) – but the sample shows the correct Cash deposit is 3,000,000.\n- The amounts do not agree with standardized figures implied in the sample example, so there are amount inconsistencies:\n  - Cash deposit: recorded $5,000,000.00, should be $3,000,000.00.\n  - Bank deposit: recorded $15,000,000.00, should be $5,000,000.00.\n  - Fixed Assets: recorded $8,000,000.00, should be $5,000,000.00.\n\n#### 2. Interest20240119019:\n- The \"risk_issues\" cell for this transaction reports an inconsistency.\n- It says: 'Original amount': 615.33, 'Recorded amount': 728.64, id: 'Interest20240119019'\n- Also, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid'\n- According to the value available in the table, the recorded amount is 728.64, but considering all other Interest Receivables for most dates, the expected value is 615.33, and the payment/receipt status should be 'Unpaid', not 'Paid'.\n- No payment method in this row, which is consistent with other Interest Receivables.\n\n#### For other rows:\n- All Purchase and Sale entries' recorded_amount matches their unit price times quantity and matches the invoice text.\n- No sales or purchase in this problem sample have amount mis-matches, payment method mis-matches, or receipt status inconsistencies detectable by the invoice line and row.\n\n#### Therefore, the 4 above are the notable, standardized inconsistencies present for this data.\n```",
