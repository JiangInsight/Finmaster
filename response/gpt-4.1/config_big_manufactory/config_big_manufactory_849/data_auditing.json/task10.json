This is an inconsistency; the correct profit should be \"194657.72\".\n- In \"Sale20240114023\", by analogy with the format, the profit is calculated as (sales amount - cost amount) but the recorded value does not match the calculation from invoice.  \n- Most lines without numeric or logic mismatches (judged by description or fields) are output with matching invoice and recorded values, but only those with a substantive mismatch (like profit) are relevant. The above lists a pattern and details those found. You can prune the list to show only the mismatches if that's preferred. If only mismatches are asked for, just output the two entries where \"profit\" is inconsistent:\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": [\n  {\n    \"Original category\": null,\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Original date\": null,\n    \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-14\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n    \"Original payment_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n    \"Original quantity\": null,\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"5.0\",\n    \"Original price\": null,\n    \"Recorded price\": \"63572.43\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n    \"Original amount\": null,\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"317862.15\",\n    \"Original tax\": null,\n    \"Recorded tax\": \"15893.11\",\n    \"Original profit\": \"67862.15\",\n    \"Recorded profit\": \"48671.48\",\n    \"Original Preparer\": null,\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n    \"Original Approver\": null,\n    \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240114023\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Original category\": null,\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Original date\": null,\n    \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-22\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n    \"Original payment_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n    \"Original quantity\": null,\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"1.0\",\n    \"Original price\": null,\n    \"Recorded price\": \"694657.72\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\",\n    \"Original amount\": null,\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"694657.72\",\n    \"Original tax\": null,\n    \"Recorded tax\": \"34732.89\",\n    \"Original profit\": \"194657.72\",\n    \"Recorded profit\": \"166336.17\",\n    \"Original Preparer\": null,\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n    \"Original Approver\": null,\n    \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240122019\"\n  }\n]}\n```",
