The three rows for id `Initial20231231001` have inconsistent amounts for \"Cash deposit\" ($5,000,000.00), \"Bank deposit\" ($15,000,000.00), and \"Fixed Assets\" ($8,000,000.00). \n2. According to the invoice (which is more reliable), the cash deposit should be $5,000,000.00, but the recorded_amount in the \"Bank deposit\" row is $15,000,000.00, which does not match the invoice's stated $5,000,000.00 for a cash deposit nor does it match the invoice descriptions in the provided data segment.\n3. All three entries share the same id. However, as per the format and example, \"Cash deposit\" should be $5,000,000.00, so the \"Recorded amount\" $15,000,000.00 for \"Bank deposit\" is inconsistentâ€”likely only $5,000,000.00 should be entered for \"Bank deposit.\"\n4. Therefore, the original, correct amount (per invoice consistency and patterns) should be $5,000,000.00 for id `Initial20231231001` as \"Cash deposit\" (and likely the other related deposit pieces), but one row lists $15,000,000.00, which is likely an input error.\n5. All other fields are either missing or consistent for this particular id and the scope of task, so only these amount fields are filled in.\n",
