For each transaction, I looked for internal inconsistency: fields that conflict with what is written in the invoice description, or, for repeated IDs, fields that differ where the invoice text indicates what the \"original\" or most authoritative value is.\n2. Only one transaction in your provided data explicitly mentions an error (already in risk_issues):  \n   - For `Purchase20231231010`, the `recorded_date` is 2024-01-05, but the invoice indicates the transaction (\"On December 31, 2023, ...\") happened on 2023-12-31.\n   - The most reliable, authoritative field is the invoice's stated date.\n   - Thus, the original date should be 2023-12-31, not the recorded 2024-01-05.\n3. Other fields (amount, category, payment info, etc.) appear consistent with the invoice and do not show discrepancies.\n4. Therefore, only `recorded_date` is incorrect and should have been 2023-12-31.\n5. I've filled all other fields as `null` because there are no other explicit inconsistencies reported for this entry. The format matches your example.",
