According to the example context, a single initialization should only have a single sum allocation across asset types that match the invoice breakdown. Here, the sum is inconsistent (5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 28,000,000, but details/institutional capital acquired are not reconciled). From the invoice, these amounts are as stated, so the issue is using the same ID for three distinct entriesâ€”it should be split or flagged for improper ID use.\n\n2. **Sale20240130031** has: \n   - **recorded_date** = 2024-02-20, but invoice says sale was on Jan 30, 2024 (should be 2024-01-30, i.e., Original date = 2024-01-30, Recorded date = 2024-02-20).\n   - **recorded_quantity** = 0.0, but invoice says 1.0 unit sold (Original quantity = 1.0, Recorded quantity = 0.0).\n   - **recorded_unit_price** = 1730784.6, but invoice says 1492870.60 (Original price = 1492870.60, Recorded price = 1730784.60).\n   - **recorded_amount** = 1604513.28, but invoice says 1492870.60 (Original amount = 1492870.60, Recorded amount = 1604513.28).\n   - All other fields agree.\n\n_Note: The category confusion in the \"Initial20231231001\" entries is less an internal field mismatch and more a structural (ID reuse) problem. The Sale20240130031 entry has direct mismatches in key value fields._",
