deposit', 'Bank deposit', 'Fixed Assets') and different amounts (5000000.0, 15000000.0, 8000000.0). The invoice says \"Cash deposit, totaling $5000000.00\", \"Bank deposit, totaling $15000000.00\", and \"Fixed Assets, totaling $8000000.00\". But all have the same transaction ID. Only one transaction ID should correspond to one entry. Based on invoice texts, the correct amount and type per invoice are:\n   - Cash deposit: 5000000.0\n   - Bank deposit: 15000000.0\n   - Fixed Assets: 8000000.0  \n   But the entries are conflicting and only one per ID should exist.\n   So, all entries for Initial20231231001 (except the correct one) are internally inconsistent, and each represents an erroneous value—likely a copy-paste or consolidation/merging error.\n\n2. For **Purchase20231231003**, the recorded amount is 1974481.24, but the invoice, unit price, and quantity (2 × 800,000) indicate the total should be 1,600,000. This is a clear inconsistency.\n   - Correct amount per invoice and fields: 1,600,000.00\n   - Recorded amount: 1,974,481.24\n\n3. All other entries either have no mismatched values between invoice and field or are consistent within the data block.\n\n_Note: Only inconsistent entries are shown here, as per request._\n\nIf you want strictly only the entries where the field doesn't match the invoice, then the main real data consistency issue (apart from duplicated IDs and structural problems in the opening balances) is **Purchase20231231003**. The rest of the “Initial*” rows with the same ID but different type/amount are structurally problematic.\n\nIf you would like only clearly strictly field-level mismatches (i.e., only Purchase20231231003), use:\n```json\n{\"solution\": [\n  {\n    \"Original category\": \"Purchase\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Purchase\",\n    \"Original date\": \"2023-12-31\",\n    \"Recorded date\": \"2023-12-31\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n    \"Original payment_method\": \"Bank Transfer\",\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Bank Transfer\",\n    \"Original quantity\": \"2.0\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"2.0\",\n    \"Original price\": \"800000.0\",\n    \"Recorded price\": \"800000.0\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": null,\n    \"Original amount\": \"1600000.0\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"1974481.24\",\n    \"Original tax\": null,\n    \"Recorded tax\": null,\n    \"Original profit\": null,\n    \"Recorded profit\": null,\n    \"Original Preparer\": \"Senior Staff\",\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": \"Senior Staff\",\n    \"Original Approver\": \"Director\",\n    \"Recorded Approver\": \"Director\",\n    \"id\": \"Purchase20231231003\"\n  }\n]}\n```\nBut for completeness, the first output above documents all internal inconsistencies with IDs and cross-checked field mismatches found.",
