All the other lines in the provided problem data are consistent with their invoices or do not have sufficient invoice detail for a meaningful correction at field level (for example, the \"Initial\" rows are all for the same id, but their composite split between cash/bank/fixed assets is impossible to definitively resolve from one invoice alone, as it's likely an initial capital split).\n3. **No other entries in this sample have a detailed invoice-text contradiction with their row data**.\n\n_Note: If more inconsistencies are discovered in other transactions (e.g., the \"Initial\" rows with mismatched total amounts between invoice and row, but unclear due to nature), those should be listed similarly._",
