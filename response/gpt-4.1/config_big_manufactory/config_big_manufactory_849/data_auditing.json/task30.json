The rows under `Initial20231231001` represent the recording of initial capital. There is only one invoice issued for the initial capital (should be a single event).\n2. However, here the `recorded_type` is separated into 3 rows: \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\", each with a different amount, but the same id and same date, and the invoice confirms all of these are parts of the same transaction.\n3. This is inconsistent with correct bookkeeping, where the initial capital is a single transaction, usually split into sub-accounts (cash, bank, fixed assets), not separate transactions with the same ID and invoice.\n4. So, the **Original category** should be \"Initial Capital\", and **Recorded category** is the split into the three components.\n5. No status, payment method, quantity, unit price, etc. are listed, so those are not at issue. Date matches. The amounts match the invoice descriptions.\n\n6. The best estimate, per the standardized and regulated invoice, is that there was a single initial capital injection on 2023-12-31, split internally into cash deposit (5,000,000), bank deposit (15,000,000), and fixed assets (8,000,000).\n\n- This is **an internal inconsistency: the transaction is split in the records with the same ID**, but the invoice suggests it's a single event. All else matches (amounts, date).\n\nThus, the above json represents the correct field mapping for the internal error present. If you want a more granular (per line) version, let me know!",
