first three rows (`Initial20231231001`): There is an internal inconsistency since the same transaction ID has been assigned to three different types of initial deposits/assets. According to accounting logic and matching the \"invoice\" descriptions, the \"Cash deposit\" should be 5,000,000; \"Bank deposit\" should be 15,000,000; and \"Fixed Assets\" 8,000,000, but they are all referenced under the same ID, likely causing confusion in actual records. \n\n- For `Purchase20231231003`, the \"invoice\" (considered reliable) describes 2 units at 800,000.00 each, totaling 1,600,000.00. The recorded fields list unit price as 865,604.25, and the amount as 1,830,885.10, which do not match the invoice. The corrected values should be as per the invoice: unit price 800,000.00, total amount 1,600,000.00.\n\nAll other rows reviewed show correct amounts/unit prices/quantities matching the invoice description, so only the above entries are output as per your requirements.",
