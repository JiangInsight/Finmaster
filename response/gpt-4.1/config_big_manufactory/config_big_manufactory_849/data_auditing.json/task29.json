But the sum of components from invoice (\"Cash deposit: 5,000,000\", \"Bank deposit: 15,000,000\", \"Fixed assets: 8,000,000\") does NOT match a plausible total. The field values themselves match the invoice, so the \"inconsistency\" is external (not with other fields in the row, but internal to the group—lack of total consistency). So, recorded values in each row match the invoice in each row. No within-row inconsistency—so SKIP output for these unless stating the caution above.\n\n  // 2.

Their total sum may not add up, but there's no within-row inconsistency to output unless grouping across the entries.\n2. **Sale20240204038** has clear internal inconsistencies between invoice snippet and the tabular fields:\n    - Invoice date: Feb 4, 2024; recorded_date: Mar 3, 2024\n    - Invoice amount: 2,109,215.99; recorded: 2,608,771.62\n    - Invoice unit price: 2,109,215.99; recorded: 2,405,193.00\n    - Invoice tax: 105,460.80; recorded: 2,322,475.53\n    - All other fields are either not provided or match.\n\n**So, only Sale20240204038 has clear within-row inconsistencies.** In the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': None, 'Recorded category': 'Sale', 'Original date': '2024-02-04', 'Recorded date': '2024-03-03', 'Original payment/receipt_status': None, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': None, 'Original payment_method': None, 'Recorded payment_method': None, 'Original quantity': None, 'Recorded quantity': '1.0', 'Original price': '2109215.99', 'Recorded price': '2405193.00', 'Original receive_method': None, 'Recorded receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Original amount': '2109215.99', 'Recorded amount': '2608771.62', 'Original tax': '105460.80', 'Recorded tax': '2322475.53', 'Original profit': None, 'Recorded profit': None, 'Original Preparer': None, 'Recorded Preparer': None, 'Original Approver': None, 'Recorded Approver': None, 'id': 'Sale20240204038'}}\n```\n",
