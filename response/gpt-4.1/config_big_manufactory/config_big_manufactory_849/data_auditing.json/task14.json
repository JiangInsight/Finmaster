In standard practice and per invoice, initial capital should not split a single transaction ID into multiple asset types unless specifically broken out as such in the invoice. The amounts sum to 5M+15M+8M = 28M, which is likely the intended total initial capital. However, this division is inconsistent unless the capital injection legal document and invoice specify this breakdown. Typically, \"Fixed Assets\" should be a separate purchase, not part of a capital injection under the same ID.\n2. **Sale20240204038**:\n   - The invoice says \"consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $2,109,215.99, totaling $2,109,215.99\", payment is via account receivable, status is unpaid. The row, however, has quantity 0.0, amount 0.0, and payment/receipt_status as \"Paid\", which is contrary to invoice and the other values. Therefore:\n     - Quantity should be 1.0 (not 0.0)\n     - Amount should be 2,109,215.99 (not 0)\n     - payment/receipt_status should be \"Unpaid\" (not \"Paid\")\n   - The tax and profit, etc, are in accordance with invoice.\n\nNo other clear inconsistencies found based on invoice wording for the sample provided.",
