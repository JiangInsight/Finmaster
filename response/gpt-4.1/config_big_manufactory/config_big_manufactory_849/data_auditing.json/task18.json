Also, the more authoritative invoice field describes the entries as elements of \"Initial Paid-in Capital\". Therefore, the corrected \"Original category\" in all three lines should be \"Initial Paid-in Capital\", not the split recorded categories. \n\n- **Sale20240202035**: The invoice says 1.0 unit at 660,969.70 each, payment method is account receivable, \"unpaid\", profit 160,969.7; but the recorded fields say quantity 0, amount 0.0, payment/receipt_status \"Paid\" and profit 183,945.73. The invoice (typically most reliable) is taken as correct; so the correct \"Original\" values are as specified in the invoice/risk_issues (1.0, unpaid, 660969.70, etc).\n\nNo other rows show a clear conflict within a single transaction, as per the standardized invoice data compared to the other fields.
