The date also mismatches the invoice.\n- **Sale20240130057**: Invoice says deal is 3 × 24,766.75 = 74,300.25, payment 74,300.25, while in the record it's 3 × 21,750.10 = 65,250.30, but the amount is 90,992.35, and date is 2024-02-01 instead of 2024-01-30 (as in invoice).\n- For other transactions, there are no internal inconsistencies between the fields and the invoice—values for unit/amount are consistent, so they're omitted from the output as per the instructions.\n- If you want all found inconsistencies, list only those with true errors—others are left out.\n\nIf you see a need for more strict explanation or want all nonidentical fields outputted regardless of error, let me know!",
