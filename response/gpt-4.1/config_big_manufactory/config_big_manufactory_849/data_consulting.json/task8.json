Define Net Cash Ratio\nTypically, the **Net Cash Ratio** is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\nHowever, with only cash flow data, and in the context of cash flow statements, sometimes the ratio is interpreted as:\n\\[\n\\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\nBut if only beginning/ending cash are given with change in cash, it's possible the expected formula is:\n\\[\n\\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Ending Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nFrom your example, it seems you expect the \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio,\" but your question asks for \"Net Cash Ratio\".\n\nAssuming standard financial ratio meaning, let's go with:\n- Net Cash Ratio = Ending Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities\n\nBut current liabilities are NOT directly stated. However, sometimes in short tasks, the \"Current Liabilities\" proxy is \"Accounts Payable + Tax Payable\" (if nothing else is specified).\n\n## 2. Extract Data from Problem\n\nFrom the statement:\n- Cash and Cash Equivalents (Ending Balance): 11,957,579.48\n- Accounts Payable: 3,500,000.00\n- Tax Payable: 819,436.82\n\nAssuming these are the only current liabilities:\n\\[\n\\text{Current Liabilities} = \\text{Accounts Payable} + \\text{Tax Payable} = 3,500,000 + 819,436.82 = 4,319,436.82\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{11,957,579.48}{4,319,436.82}\n\\]\n\n## 3. Calculate\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{11,957,579.48}{4,319,436.82} = 2.77\n\\]\n\n## 4. Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Ratio\": \"2.77\"} }\n```",
