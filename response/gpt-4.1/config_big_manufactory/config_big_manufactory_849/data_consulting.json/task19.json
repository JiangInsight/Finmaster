In such a case, using ending inventory as average inventory is standard. But for consistency, if following the provided solution logic from the example:\n     - The example also used (0 + ending inventory) / 2\n\n   Thus:\n   - Inventory Turnover Ratio = 11,600,000.00 ÷ 2,800,000.00 ≈ 4.14\n\n   However, on reviewing the sample, it actually used ending inventory as the divisor, not average inventory, when the starting inventory was 0:\n   - Example: Inventory Turnover Ratio = COGS / Ending Inventory\n\n   So, using sample's logic for consistency:\n   - Inventory Turnover Ratio = 11,600,000.00 / 5,600,000.00 = 2.07\n\nBUT, in sample, they did use (0 + 5,090,000) / 2 = 2,545,000 for average, and got around 1.73 (since 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73). Thus, average inventory should be used.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n- Current Ratio: 23,990,150.22 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ 5.55\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio: 11,600,000.00 / 2,800,000.00 = 4.14\n\n**Use two decimals, as per the sample:**\n- Current Ratio: 5.55\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio: 4.14\n\n**Final answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Current Ratio\": \"5.55\", \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"4.14\"} }\n```\n",
