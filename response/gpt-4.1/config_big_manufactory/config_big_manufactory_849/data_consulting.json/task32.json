Free Cash Flow (FCF):**\n- Per cash flow statement: Net increase in cash and cash equivalents = -8,042,420.52  \n- Direct FCF, as per statement and sample: **-8,042,420.52**\n\n**2. Return on Assets (ROA):**\n- ROA = Net Profit / Average Total Assets\n- Average Total Assets = (Beginning + Ending) / 2 = (28,000,000 + 33,610,271.98) / 2 ≈ 30,805,135.99\n- Net Profit = 1,290,835.16\n- ROA = 1,290,835.16 / 30,805,135.99 ≈ 0.0419 = **4.05%**\n\n**3. Return on Equity (ROE):**\n- ROE = Net Profit / Average Owner's Equity\n- Average Equity = (28,000,000 + 29,290,835.16) / 2 = 28,645,417.58\n- ROE = 1,290,835.16 / 28,645,417.58 ≈ 0.0451 = **4.41%**\n\n**4. Net Cash Ratio:**\n- Net Cash Ratio = (Cash + Bank Deposits) / Total Current Liabilities (latest period)\n- Latest:\n    - Cash on Hand = 9,383,594.56\n    - Bank Deposits = 2,573,984.92\n    - Total = 11,957,579.48\n    - Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\n- Ratio = 11,957,579.48 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ 2.77\n\n**However**, the sample calls for net cash ratio as **Net Cash / Total Assets** (as commonly practiced in some contexts, and to match the ratios in the sample):\n\n- Net Cash Ratio = (Cash + Bank Deposits) / Total Assets = 11,957,579.48 / 33,610,271.98 ≈ 0.3558 ≈ **0.36**\n\nBut the sample seems to take ONLY the ending balance of cash + bank deposits and divides by total assets:\n- Ending balance = 11,957,579.48 (from \"Ending Balance\" in cash flow table), Total Assets = 33,610,271.98\n- Net Cash Ratio = 11,957,579.48 / 33,610,271.98 = 0.3558 ~ 0.36\n\nBut the sample calculated this as 0.28, so let's ensure we're matching the method. Let's try\n- Net Cash Ratio = Ending Balance / Latest Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity (which equals total assets): 11,957,579.48 / 33,610,271.98 = 0.36\nWe keep 2 decimal places: **0.36**\n\nBut the sample used 0.28, possibly for a different scenario; for this specific data, **0.36** is the correct value.\n\n**5. Net Profit Margin:**\n- Net Profit Margin = Net Profit / Revenue = 1,290,835.16 / 16,388,736.33 = 0.07875 = **7.88%**\n\n**6. Gross Profit Margin:**\n- Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Revenue = 4,788,736.33 / 16,388,736.33 = 0.2922 = **29.22%**\n",
