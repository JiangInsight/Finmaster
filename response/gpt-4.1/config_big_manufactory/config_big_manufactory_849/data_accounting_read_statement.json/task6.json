The question asks for \"the specific line items and value of tangible items that are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes\".\n2. On a balance sheet, these are generally listed as \"Fixed Assets\" (also known as property, plant, and equipment) and sometimes \"Inventory\", but the wording relates primarily to Fixed Assets as opposed to inventory.\n3. The given example only extracts the value of \"Fixed Assets\" for the answer (Inventory is not included).\n4. From the provided table:\n\n| Account      | Initial_amount | Initial_date | End_amount | End_date   |\n|--------------|---------------|--------------|------------|------------|\n| Fixed Assets | 8000000.00    | 2023-12-31   | 9726015.08 | 2024-02-05 |\n\n5. Therefore, the initial value is '8000000.00' and the end value is '9726015.08'.\n\nFinal answer in required format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '9726015.08'} }\n```",
