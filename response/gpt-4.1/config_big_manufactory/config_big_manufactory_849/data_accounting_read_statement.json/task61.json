The two specific line items to extract are:\n   - The costs incurred to secure customer orders & deliver goods/services. This is typically represented by \"Selling Expenses\" in the income statement.\n   - The cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment & other long-term assets. This is typically found as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the cash flow statement.\n\n2. Find these in the statements:\n   - **Income Statement**: \"Selling Expenses\" is 1,334,099.97\n   - **Cash Flow Statement**: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is 1,726,015.08\n\n3. Group by statement: Per instructions, maintain original order: first income statement (for value1), then cash flow statement (for value2).\n\n4. Final answer:\n   - value1: '1334099.97' (Selling Expenses)\n   - value2: '1726015.08' (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n",
