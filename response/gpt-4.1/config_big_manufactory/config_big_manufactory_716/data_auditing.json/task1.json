The invoice specifically for the Cash deposit describes $5,000,000.00, therefore the rows for Bank deposit and Fixed Assets under this same id and invoice have category and amount mismatches.  \n- The rest of the entries in this excerpt are internally consistent when cross-checked with their invoice fields, except for the duplicated “Initial20231231001” with changing categories and amounts.\n\nIf you want all inconsistencies in all rows (for the whole big table), let me know!",
