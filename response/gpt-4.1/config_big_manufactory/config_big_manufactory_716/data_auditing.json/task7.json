Transactions With the Same ID, Different Amount (Initial20231231001)\n- The \"Initial20231231001\" id is repeated with different categories and amounts: Cash deposit (5,000,000.0), Bank deposit (15,000,000.0), Fixed Assets (8,000,000.0).\n- However, per the invoice text, each matches its amount.\n- **Not an inconsistency per row**, but if supposed to sum to something, may suggest an integration inconsistency. But as per the row and invoice, values are correct.\n\n#### 2. Typos in Receive Method (Interest20240102002, Interest20240128028)\n- For Interest20240102002: The standard expected value (\"Interest receviable\") and the recorded value (\"Interest receviable\") match, so **no issue on this particular one**. (There's a suggestion in the example, but no actual spelling error in your instance.)\n- For Interest20240128028: The recorded receive method is \"Account Receivable\" but invoice/other records would expect \"Interest receviable\" based on all other similar entries. **This is a typo/mismatch.**\n\n#### 3. All \"Interest Receivables\" Transactions Elsewhere\n- All others have \"Interest receviable\" or, in one case in your sample, didn't have an error.\n\n#### 4. All Other Purchases/Sales/Expenses\n- Checks for mismatches between recorded_quantity * recorded_unit_price vs recorded_amount: For all purchases/sales, the math aligns.\n- Checks for cost per unit mismatches: Amount matches invoice.\n- Approver/preparer for each aligns to invoice.\n- Dates, payment status, payment method for each row matches invoice.\n\n#### 5. No Other Obvious Internal Inconsistencies\n- Tax and after tax amounts match for sales.\n- No negative sales or purchase amounts, only for some interest receivable (which may represent reversals or corrections).\n\n#### 6. No Error Rows for Spelling \"Interest receviable\" except the specifically highlighted one.\n\nThus, only one actual **internal error** found per your data: in \"Interest20240128028\", where receive_method is wrongly recorded as \"Account Receivable\" instead of the likely correct \"Interest receviable\".\n\n---\n**If you are seeking a different kind of inconsistency (such as issues with initial deposit reconciling with fixed assets + cash + bank), clarify scope. But internally, row-by-row, only the above clear typo is found.**\n\n**If you meant to do ONLY the rows with an error, rather than show each row is correct, just keep the one for Interest20240128028:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"Original category\": \"Interest Receivables\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Interest Receivables\",\n    \"Original date\": \"2024-01-28\",\n    \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-28\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n    \"Original payment_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n    \"Original quantity\": null,\n    \"Recorded quantity\": null,\n    \"Original price\": null,\n    \"Recorded price\": null,\n    \"Original receive_method\": \"Interest receviable\",\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Account Receivable\",\n    \"Original amount\": \"135.28\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"135.28\",\n    \"Original tax\": null,\n    \"Recorded tax\": null,\n    \"Original profit\": null,\n    \"Recorded profit\": null,\n    \"Original Preparer\": null,\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n    \"Original Approver\": null,\n    \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n    \"id\": \"Interest20240128028\"\n}}\n```\n\nLet me know if you only want errors listed, or all rows (even when correct)!",
