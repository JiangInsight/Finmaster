But in the current problem, the amounts are: Cash deposit: 5,000,000.0; Bank deposit: 15,000,000.0; Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.0.\n- The IDs are re-used for distinct kinds of assets (should be distinct IDs, or at least amounts/types be in line for a single transaction).\n- There is an internal inconsistency: the same ID is being used, but the amounts and types do not match what would be expected from the standardized invoice description (which should be the source of truth).\n- **Estimated Correction**: Each asset type/amount should match the break-out in the invoice. In this context, for this record, the data should be split into three properly-typed single transactions, or, if this is summing up, then the total amount should be 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 16,000,000 for \"Initial20231231001\", unless the true sum is something else as per official invoice.\n\n**Note:** No correction is possible for payment method/receipt status etc, because those fields are empty or not applicable to these initial records. The main errors are in the inconsistent types and amount values associated with the shared transaction ID.",
