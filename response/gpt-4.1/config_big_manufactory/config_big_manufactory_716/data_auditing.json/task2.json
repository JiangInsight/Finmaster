In standardized accounting (especially referencing the invoice line), the values from the invoice are considered authoritative:\n   - Cash deposit should be 3000000.0\n   - Bank deposit should be 5000000.0\n   - Fixed Assets should be 5000000.0\n   But here, the \"recorded_amount\" is 5000000.0, 15000000.0, 8000000.0, all for Initial20231231001. This inconsistency indicates possible data entry errors (mis-recorded amount). Based on the invoice details in each row, the \"recorded amount\" should match the \"invoice\" text.\n\n2. **Interest20240128028**  \n   The recorded date is \"2024-02-20\" but the invoice says \"On January 28, 2024\". The more reliable source is the invoice, so the recorded date should be \"2024-01-28\".\n\n**If you need a full field mapping (e.g., price, quantity, etc.) for every other row, please specify the types of inconsistency you want to prioritize!**\n",
