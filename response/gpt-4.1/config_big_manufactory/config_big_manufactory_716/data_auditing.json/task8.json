For transaction `Interest20240121021`, the description in the invoice says:  \n> On January 21, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Interest Receivables, totaling $135.28.  \nBut the recorded value in `recorded_amount` is **148.69**.  \nThus, the inconsistency is in the recorded amount field, and the best estimate of the correct value, based on the invoice, is **135.28**.  \nNo other fields have detectable inconsistencies in this row.  \nAll other fields for this transaction match or are not possible to cross-check given the invoice text.  \nThus, the JSON above is correct.",
