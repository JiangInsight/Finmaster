However, comparably to similar examples, the sum of the Cash deposit, Bank deposit and Fixed Assets should be the same in all lines that share the same id.\n  // From the example, error is found if for the same id, the amount and type do not match invoice.\n  // Compare with previous standard, all three \"Initial20231231001\" lines share the same id and date but total different types and amounts. \n  // The \"risk_issues\" or example solution also addresses such grouping; only one set should exist per id or, if split, the split amounts should sum sensibly.\n\n  // -- error: Based on a standard capital entry, \"Initial20231231001\" should represent a single transaction or at least, the sum of the capital amounts (cash + bank + fixed assets) should equal the total contributed/registered capital.\n  // -- Here, the amounts are: Cash deposit: 5,000,000; Bank deposit: 15,000,000; Fixed Assets: 8,000,000. Total: 28,000,000. But invoice in each line only states their own line value, matching the field.\n  // -- This matches the given example, so no internal mismatch within a row, but conceptual issue: splitting an initial capital registration into multiple lines with the same id but different categories/amounts is inconsistent with single-invoice principle.\n  // -- But per instructions, output only per-row inconsistency.\n\n  // Move on.\n\n  // Now, check for mismatches between recorded fields and invoice for each row.\n\n  // Now, jump to:\n  {\n    \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Administrative Expenses\",\n    \"Original date\": \"2024-02-01\",\n    \"Recorded date\": \"2024-02-12\",\n    \"Original price\": \"2120132.85\",\n    \"Recorded price\": \"2030146.55\",\n    \"Original amount\": \"2120132.85\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"2468968.01\",\n    \"Original tax\": \"106006.64\",\n    \"Recorded tax\": \"1757647.75\",\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240201034\"\n  }\n]}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- All \"Initial20231231001\" entries each have an invoice specifying the deposit type and amount matching their row fields. While there is a conceptual risk (splitting a registration of capital into three, with same id), per instruction, the field values per row match the invoice for that row, so no per-row inconsistency.\n- For \"Sale20240201034\", there are multiple mismatches:\n    - The recorded category is \"Administrative Expenses\", but the invoice (which is reliable) shows it should be \"Sale\".\n    - The recorded amount, price, and tax do not match the invoice details.\n    - The recorded date is \"2024-02-12\", but invoice date (implied from invoice text and id) is \"2024-02-01\".\n- Therefore, the solution lists only the row with true field discrepancies per the invoice text, as in your example output.",
