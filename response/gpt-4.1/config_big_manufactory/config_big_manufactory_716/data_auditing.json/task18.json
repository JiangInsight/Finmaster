The invoices specify $5,000,000.00 for Cash deposit, $15,000,000.00 for Bank deposit, and $8,000,000.00 for Fixed Assets, indicating the recorded_type and recorded_amount are mismatched between rows. The row shown here (recorded_type: Cash deposit, amount: 5,000,000.0) should be: recorded_type: Bank deposit, amount: 15,000,000.0 to align with the invoice. So, estimate correct values as per the matched invoice: recorded_type: Bank deposit, amount: 15,000,000.0.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"Initial20231231001\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Bank deposit\",\n    \"Original category\": \"Cash deposit\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"15000000.0\",\n    \"Original amount\": \"5000000.0\",\n    \"fields_with_issues\": [\"recorded_type\", \"recorded_amount\"],\n    \"explanation\": \"For id Initial20231231001, as above, type and amount are swapped.

The recorded fields show recorded_quantity: 0.0, recorded_amount: 0.0, payment/receipt_status: Unpaid, profit: 453,928.5, which contradicts the invoice (the most authoritative record).

If swapped, mark as inconsistency.\n- **Step 3:** For sales, compare quantity, amount, and profit (derived from invoice narrative/arithmetic) with the table's recorded values.\n- **Step 4:** Where payment/receipt_status in the row and the description differ (invoice says paid/unpaid but the field disagrees), this is an inconsistency.\n- **Step 5:** For each error, report the recorded value, best estimate for the correct value, and which fields are affected.\n\n*Note: Other records appear consistent upon comparison with the invoices, or don't have enough evidence in this table to declare an internal inconsistency (e.g. single row per id, or small non-standard amounts for one row only), except for the highlighted ones above.*",
