The amount matches, product info matches, etc.\n\n- The preamble and prior example specify only to output the error in this row/field, if there is only one.\n\n**Hence, the only inconsistency is:**\n- recorded tax amount is 1,229,548.22, but should be 72,772.67 per invoice and calculations.\n\nAll other columns are correct or not inconsistent with the (usually most reliable) invoice and internal fields.\n",
