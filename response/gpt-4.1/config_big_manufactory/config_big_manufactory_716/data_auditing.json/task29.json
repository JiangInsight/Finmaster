Recorded data is inconsistent with these facts.\"\n    }\n]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initial20231231001** – This ID is reused for multiple different major types of account initialization (cash, bank, fixed assets) with different amounts, but the invoice text matches the specific type/amount in each row. Each distinct transaction should have a unique ID and matching amount. The \"recorded_amount\"s are inconsistent when coupled with the same ID and same date.\n2. **Sale20240121022** – Multiple fields diverge from the invoice, which is considered standard and reliable. Specifically:  \n   - The invoice says the transaction occurred on 2024-01-21, so “recorded_date” 2024-02-11 is incorrect.  \n   - The “recorded_amount” should be $2,170,939.20.  \n   - The “recorded_unit_price” (51115.0) should be $2,170,939.20.  \n   - The “recorded_tax” ($2035110.06) is an order of magnitude too large and should be $108,546.96.\n\nNo other transactions exhibit clear internal inconsistencies based on a comparison with invoice text and fields provided.\n\n_Note_: If you want the output in the reduced exact template of a SINGLE output JSON as in your example, just the last Sale20240121022 entry would be returned. Let me know if that's the desired output. This version provides all discovered inconsistencies for transparency.",
