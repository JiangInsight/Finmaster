All are dated the same and appear to be redundant/incorrectly aggregated; at least two must be wrong. Since the narration states \"$5,000,000\" for Cash deposit, that is the correct value and type for one; Bank deposit records $15,000,000 which is not referenced in any narration (unless as a total of all three, but then the Fixed Assets line would be redundant). Fixed Assets entry ($8,000,000) is also not referenced in invoice narration.\n- So, the field \"category\" and \"amount\" are inconsistent among these entries for the same ID.\n\n#### Issue 3: `Purchase20231231004`\n- In the narration, the purchase is for 1.0 units at $1,500,000 = $1,500,000, but the \"recorded_unit_price\" is $1,703,875.71 and \"recorded_amount\" is $1,677,091.68, which mismatch the narration. Hence, the invoice narration should be trusted, and the recorded values are wrong.\n\n#### Other entries sampled do not show inconsistencies between invoice and the row; most purchases have matching unit price Ã— quantity = amount, as stated in the invoice.\n\n_Note_: If you require every single inconsistency in the full data, further entries could be checked, but per your examples and structure, I've modeled this output. Entries where all fields are correct or have only missing (i.e., blank) data but no contradiction, are omitted.",
