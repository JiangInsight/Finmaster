In row with `id: Sale20240121022`, the invoice says: \"On January 21, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $2,170,939.20, totaling $2,170,939.20. The cost amount for this transaction was $1,500,000.00, with a tax amount of $108,546.96, leading to a total amount due of $2,062,392.24... receive_method: account receviable, unpaid.\"\n2. The `recorded_type` (Recorded category) is **Purchase**, but the invoice (\"for a Sale\") clearly indicates a **Sale**.\n3. The `recorded_tax_amount` is **2,159,695.72**, but the tax in the invoice is **108,546.96**.\n4. There are no other field inconsistencies directly contradicted by the invoice for this id.\n5. All other fields are either not specified in the invoice (date, payment method, etc.) or match the pattern.\n6. Therefore, we output the fields with inconsistencies (category/type and tax), other entries as null if not contradicted nor supported by invoice.\n```",
