All three \"Initial20231231001\" entries are for initial capital injection but are split between \"Cash deposit,\" \"Bank deposit,\" and \"Fixed Assets.\" Based on standard accounting, these should be entries allocating the total owner's equity injection to cash, bank, and fixed assets.\n2. The amounts and types are consistent with the invoice statements, and the sum of all three aligns with a reasonable initial capital allocation.\n3. Therefore, there are no internal inconsistencies *within* each row, but the type/category should consistently reflect \"Initial Capital\" for all three, not \"Cash deposit,\" \"Bank deposit,\" and \"Fixed Assets\" respectivelyâ€”this is more a classification/labeling harmonization.\n4. Since the question asks for entries with *internal* inconsistencies, and some fields are considered more reliable (invoice), in this instance, the main issue is with the \"Recorded category\" label which does not match the economic substance implied in the invoice text, which treats all three as initial capital allocations.\n\n**Note:** All other rows in the excerpt provided match across invoice and fields; the only entries with misleading/categorization differences are these initial capital allocation entries.
