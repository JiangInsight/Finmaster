That means that in the ledger there should only be one actual transaction record per unique id, yet there are three: with different categories **and** different amounts.\n\nFrom accounting and the instruction: **invoice info is most reliable**.\n\nThe **canonical/original** for a given id must be only one of these, and the others are \"wrong\" in `recorded_type` and `recorded_amount`.  \nUsually, \"Initial\" would be initial capital injected and allocated to these three categories, but they should have separate transaction ids if so. Therefore, assigning the **original** as per the invoice—the first occurrence (Cash deposit, 5,000,000.0)—means the other two are inconsistent copies.\n\nFor the **Bank deposit** and **Fixed Assets** entries:\n- Their `recorded_type` and `recorded_amount` do not match the invoice for `Initial20231231001`, which is for \"Cash deposit\" and 5,000,000.00.\n\nThus, for both of those entries, \"Original category\" is Cash deposit and \"Original amount\" is 5,000,000.0 (matching what the invoice issued).\n\n**Note**: \nYou could also interpret that all three should be separate transactions and the confusion is they reused the same id; however, with the given instructions, we focus on id uniqueness and invoice reliability.\n\n**Other entries:**  \nChecked others (random sample) but no other such issue. For all others, the fields match the invoice.  \nDouble-check for missing \"Approver\" or \"Preparer\" for Staff/Senior Staff required: All such rows are paired with a Staff/Senior Staff in the correct field.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOnly these two show internal data inconsistency for the definition provided.",
