Comparing the row for `id = Purchase20231231001`:\n   - The `invoice` text states: \"...an invoice was issued for a Purchase, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $1000000.00, totaling $1000000.00. The payment_method ... was bank transfer, and this transaction was paid...\"\n   - The table row's `recorded_type` is \"Sale\" (should be \"Purchase\").\n   - The table row's `recorded_amount` is \"1068361.91\" (but unit price x quantity in both table and invoice = 1 x 1000000 = 1000000.00).\n   - All other core details (quantity, price, payment method, status, preparer, approver, supplier) are consistent.\n   - Therefore, the inconsistencies are:\n     - `recorded_type` (\"Sale\") vs invoice (\"Purchase\")\n     - `recorded_amount` (\"1068361.91\") vs invoice/calculation (\"1000000.0\")\n   - The correct category and amount should be taken from the invoice.\n\n2. For all other rows, no apparent field-level internal inconsistencies can be inferred from the invoice text + line-to-line matching.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Only `Purchase20231231001` is incorrect for both category and amount.\n- Other fields do not show contradictions between recorded and invoice evidence in the provided data.\n\n**(If there were more inconsistencies found, they would be included in the list in the same manner as above.)**",
