The most reliable set is the invoice field, so the original should be \"Cash deposit\" and $5,000,000. The rows with \"Bank deposit\" and \"Fixed Assets\" for the same id and date (but different amounts) are inconsistent with the invoice, so both those rows are flagged.\n- For `Expense20240204001`, the invoice says \"Paid\", $52,734.73, but the recorded row says \"Unpaid\", $61,183.20. Both fields are inconsistent and the correction is clear from the invoice.\n- No other inconsistencies found: all other details are consistent with the invoice.\n```",
