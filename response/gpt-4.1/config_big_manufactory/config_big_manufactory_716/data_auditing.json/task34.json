Compare the highly reliable invoice/description with the actual row fields (given task hint: invoice is more reliable).\n2. The invoice says:\n   - Date: February 4, 2024\n   - Category: Sale, not Sales Expenses\n   - Quantity: 1.0, not 0.0\n   - Unit Price: 1431969.88, not 1523103.98\n   - Amount: 1431969.88, not 0.0\n   - Tax amount: 71598.49, not 1357854.33\n   - Profit: 431969.88 (seems to match in both)\n   - Customer: C008\n3. The recorded row shows many mismatches:\n   - \"recorded_type\" is \"Sales Expenses\" when should be \"Sale\"\n   - \"recorded_date\" is 2024-02-15 not 2024-02-04\n   - \"recorded_quantity\" is 0.0 not 1.0\n   - \"recorded_unit_price\" is 1523103.98 not 1431969.88\n   - \"recorded_amount\" is 0.0 not 1431969.88\n   - \"recorded_tax_amount\" is 1357854.33 not 71598.49\n   - All other fields that match are left as is or blank (as in invoice).\n4. Return all detected mismatches in the required JSON format, using Invoice as 'original/correct.'\n\n**Note**: If Payment/receipt status, method, receive_method, profit are the same or not presented, leave as matching or blank.",
