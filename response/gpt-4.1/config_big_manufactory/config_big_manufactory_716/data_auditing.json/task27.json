The cost amount for this transaction was $1000000.00, with a tax amount of $71598.49, leading to a total amount due of $1360371.39.\"\n- But in the fields:  \n   - 'recorded_type' is \"Sales Expenses\" (should be \"Sale\")\n   - 'recorded_unit_price' is 1604327.32, but invoice says 1431969.88\n   - 'recorded_amount' is 1644688.0, but invoice and correct calculation is 1431969.88\n- The rest of fields line up (quantity, customer, cost, tax, etc.), so we use the invoice for the correct values.\n- No info in either place about preparer/approver, so left as null.",
