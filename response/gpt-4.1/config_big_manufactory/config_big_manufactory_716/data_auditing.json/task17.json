But the transaction IDs and dates are the same.\n- According to the invoices:\n  - Cash deposit: $5,000,000.00\n  - Bank deposit: $15,000,000.00\n  - Fixed Assets: $8,000,000.00\n- However, the row labeled \"Cash deposit\" in the table reports 5,000,000; the row labeled \"Bank deposit\" reports 15,000,000; but the second row (id: Initial20231231001, recorded_type: Bank deposit) actually records 15,000,000 (matching the invoice), and the third row (id: Initial20231231001, recorded_type: Fixed Assets) records 8,000,000 (matching the invoice).\n- The issue is that the ID \"Initial20231231001\" is used for all three types, with three separate amounts, which is inconsistent. There should be one transaction per unique ID per unique event, but instead, three categories are provided under the same ID with different values.\n- More precisely, from the invoice, the three original categories and corresponding amounts are as follows:\n  - Cash deposit: 5,000,000\n  - Bank deposit: 15,000,000\n  - Fixed Assets: 8,000,000\n- But with the repeated use of the same ID, this creates internal confusion. The solution calls out the overloading of the ID and that the amounts reported under each are inconsistent with what should be a single standardized field.\n- No further field mismatch is clear for the rest (not a miss-allocated amount or swapped unit price, etc.). In all other transaction types, amounts and detail line up with the (reliable) invoice text.\n\n**If you would like to review all other lines and any tiny error (such as minor field typographic error), let me know!**",
