All have the same id and date, meaning they're linked and together sum to $28,000,000.00. But recorded values differ: in this extract, Cash deposit is $5,000,000.00, Bank deposit is $15,000,000.00, and Fixed Assets is $8,000,000.00. However, in the extract only the Cash deposit row is shown with $5,000,000.00; the Bank deposit row is shown as $15,000,000.00, Fixed Assets as $8,000,000.00, but the primary field in the table for the id=Initial20231231001 Cash deposit is $5,000,000.00 where it should have been $15,000,000.00 for Bank deposit row and $8,000,000.00 for Fixed Assets row (but got $5,000,000.00 instead). Thus, the amount is misattributed or repeated. (If these appear as 3 rows with the same id, only one can be right.)\n\n- Therefore, for id `Initial20231231001`:\n    - The **Cash deposit** recorded amount should be $5,000,000.00 (correct), but if the row for the id is Bank deposit or Fixed Assets and amount is $5,000,000.00, this is wrong.\n    - The **Bank deposit** recorded amount is $15,000,000.00; if it was $5,000,000.00, it would be wrong.\n    - The **Fixed Assets** recorded amount is $8,000,000.00; if it was $5,000,000.00, it would be wrong.\n\nGiven your extract, for the provided rows:\n- The 'Cash deposit' row is correct.\n- However, if the other two rows (Bank deposit and Fixed Assets) both currently have the \"recorded_amount\" of the Cash deposit row ($5,000,000.00), they should be $15,000,000.00 and $8,000,000.00 respectively.\n\nSo, the repeated id with different categories and amounts means at least two are wrong if all have $5,000,000.00. Given your snippet, both Bank deposit and Fixed Assets have the wrong amount.\n\nThis is reported accordingly. All other rows (Purchases, Expenses, Sales, etc.) are consistent with invoice details, so no other inconsistencies are present in your extract.",
