Find Initial Accounts Receivable\n\nLook for the initial balance (as of 2023-12-31) of Accounts Receivable in the \"Initial...\" entries.\n\n### Review of Initial Entries:\n\n- Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit             | 5000000.0  \n- Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit             | 15000000.0\n- Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets             | 8000000.0\n\nNone of the \"Initial\" entries mention Accounts Receivable (AR).\n\n**So:**\n- **Accounts Receivable Initial Value = 0.00**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Find All Sales \"Unpaid\"/to \"Account Receivable\"\n\nAdd all sales (type = Sale) where payment/receipt_status is \"Unpaid\" (can be empty but receive_method is Account Receivable), or receive_method is \"Account Receivable\".\n\n### Process:\n\nLet's go through all \"Sale\" entries and sum all those unpaid, i.e., that are assigned to Account Receivable (for some: payment/receipt_status is Unpaid, for some: receive_method is Account Receivable, sometimes both).\n\n---\n\n### **List of Sale Entries & AR Evaluation**\n\nLet's go date by date.\n\n#### 2024-01-03\n- Sale20240103001 | Sale | ... | amount: 1411983.38 | payment/receipt_status: Unpaid | receive_method: Account Receivable  \n  → Add 1,411,983.38\n\n#### 2024-01-06\n- Sale20240106004 | Sale | ... | amount: 1,180,660.04 | payment/receipt_status: Unpaid | receive_method: Account Receivable  \n  → Add 1,180,660.04\n\n#### 2024-01-07\n- Sale20240107006 | Sale | ... | amount: 2,183,357.44 | payment/receipt_status: Unpaid | receive_method: Account Receivable  \n  → Add 2,183,357.44\n\n#### 2024-01-09\n- Sale20240109007 | Sale | ... | amount: 1,081,640.66 | payment/receipt_status: Unpaid | receive_method: Account Receivable  \n  → Add 1,081,640.66\n\n#### 2024-01-21\n- Sale20240121022 | Sale | ... | amount: 2,170,939.20 | payment/receipt_status: Unpaid | receive_method: Account Receivable  \n  → Add 2,170,939.20\n\n#### 2024-01-27\n- Sale20240127028 | Sale | ... | amount: 1,384,684.30 | payment/receipt_status: Unpaid | receive_method: Account Receivable  \n  → Add 1,384,684.30\n\n#### 2024-01-30\n- Sale20240130032 | Sale | ... | amount: 2,101,413.12 | payment/receipt_status: Unpaid | receive_method: Account Receivable  \n  → Add 2,101,413.12\n\n#### 2024-02-03\n- Sale20240203036 | Sale | ... | amount: 1,974,918.04 | payment/receipt_status: Unpaid | receive_method: Account Receivable  \n  → Add 1,974,918.04\n\n#### 2024-02-04\n- Sale20240204039 | Sale | ... | amount: 1,431,969.88 | payment/receipt_status: Unpaid | receive_method: Account Receivable  \n  → Add 1,431,969.88\n\n##### Cross-check: Are there any paid sale entries to exclude?  \nYes, all paid sales (where payment method/receipt status is \"Paid\" or receive_method is \"Cash\", etc.) are NOT AR.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Sum the Above Sales\n\nAdd up:\n\n| Date         | Amount         |\n|--------------|---------------|\n| 2024-01-03   | 1,411,983.38   |\n| 2024-01-06   | 1,180,660.04   |\n| 2024-01-07   | 2,183,357.44   |\n| 2024-01-09   | 1,081,640.66   |\n| 2024-01-21   | 2,170,939.20   |\n| 2024-01-27   | 1,384,684.30   |\n| 2024-01-30   | 2,101,413.12   |\n| 2024-02-03   | 1,974,918.04   |\n| 2024-02-04   | 1,431,969.88   |\n| **Total**    | ?             |\n\nNow, calculate:\n\n1,411,983.38  \n+1,180,660.04  \n+2,183,357.44  \n+1,081,640.66  \n+2,170,939.20  \n+1,384,684.30  \n+2,101,413.12  \n+1,974,918.04  \n+1,431,969.88  \n------------------\nAdd step by step:\n\n1,411,983.38 + 1,180,660.04  = 2,592,643.42  \n+2,183,357.44                = 4,776,000.86  \n+1,081,640.66                = 5,857,641.52  \n+2,170,939.20                = 8,028,580.72  \n+1,384,684.30                = 9,413,265.02  \n+2,101,413.12                = 11,514,678.14  \n+1,974,918.04                = 13,489,596.18  \n+1,431,969.88                = 14,921,566.06  \n\nWait, the above addition actually has 8 items, but in the step list we have 9 items; I missed one addition.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nAfter  \n+2,101,413.12 --> 11,514,678.14  \nSo, next:  \n1,974,918.04 ==> 11,514,678.14 + 1,974,918.04 = 13,489,596.18  \nFinal: +1,431,969.88 ==> 13,489,596.18 + 1,431,969.88 = 14,921,566.06  \n\nSo the **total is 14,921,566.06**\n\nWait: Let's check if there are other \"Unpaid AR\" sales in this period (did we miss any):\n\n- Are there any other AR sales? Review other Sale rows:\n  - All other entries (with payment_method/receive_method as \"Cash\" or \"Paid\") do not affect AR.\n  - All AR are in the above computations.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Subtract Any Collected AR/Paid by Customers\n\nAre there collections of AR (where customers pay AR)?  \nNo explicit receipts of AR are listed in the transactions. All paid sales are direct cash/bank sales, not collections from AR. Therefore, **no AR were received/cleared within this period**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Consider Offset or Write-off\n\nNo entries indicate write-offs or AR offsets.\n\n---\n\n## 6. FINAL ANSWERS\n\n### **Accounts Receivable Initial Value:**  \nFrom above: **0.00**\n\n### **Accounts Receivable Final Value:**  \nSum of \"Unpaid\" Sales:\n**14,921,566.06**\n\n---\n\n## Output JSON\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"14921566.06\"}}\n```\n",
