                        "content": "Let's solve step by step as per the instruction, focusing on **current assets** only.\n\n## Step 1: Identify Current Assets\n\n**Current Assets** include:\n- Cash and cash equivalents (Cash, Bank Deposit)\n- Accounts Receivable (money to be received from sales, unpaid)\n- Interest Receivables\n- Inventory (goods for sale)—but note for heavy equipment companies, sometimes inventory is included as current assets, sometimes not, depending on operating cycle. Here, purchases of equipment appear for resale, so inventory is relevant.\n- Prepaid expenses and similar short-term assets (not applicable as per data)\n- (Note: Fixed assets are **not** current assets.)\n\n### Fields to Use:\n- Cash: “Cash deposit”, “Bank deposit”, transfers between bank/cash do not impact total current assets.\n- Inventory: Unused paid-for stock (purchases less COGS from sales).\n- Account Receivable: Sales marked as \"Unpaid\"\n- Interest Receivable\n\n## Step 2: Initial Value\n\nFrom the initial balance (2023-12-31):\n\n| id                 | type          | amount     |\n|--------------------|--------------|------------|\n| Cash deposit       | Cash         | 5,000,000  |\n| Bank deposit       | Bank         | 15,000,000 |\n\nTotal initial current assets (as of 2023-12-31):  \n**= 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 = 20,000,000**\n\n## Step 3: Final Value (as of 2024-02-05, after all listed transactions)\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n### 3.1 Cash & Bank Ending Balance\n\n#### Find all inflows and outflows. Treat bank/cash as one pool (they are fully fungible), only purchases, expenses, sales, and transfers with external world affect total. Internal transfer (bank-to-cash or vice versa) does **not** affect total; just splits.\n\n#### Inflows:\n- Sales **Received** (marked as \"Paid\")\n- Bank to Cash transfer: **Not actual inflow** (internal)\n\n#### Outflows:\n- Purchases (paid)\n- Expenses (all paid)\n- Fixed asset purchases (paid)—**not current asset, but removes cash!**\n- Cash/Bank used for unpaid purchases: cash not yet spent (will only affect when paid)\n- \"Paid\" purchases affect immediately; \"Unpaid\" go to payables\n\n#### Sale amounts: only PAID sales bring in cash.\n#### Purchases: only PAID purchases reduce cash immediately; UNPAID are not yet cash outflow.\n\n- All \"expenses\" (admin, sales, financial): if \"Paid\": reduce cash  \n- All \"Fixed Assets Purchase\": \"Paid\": reduce cash (but, fixed asset not current asset)\n- All equipment purchases on \"Paid\": reduce cash, but they become inventory first, and are recognized as COGS when sold.\n\n#### Reasoning for cash change:\n\nSo, **Ending Cash/Bank = Initial + Cash inflows - Cash outflows**\n\nNow, let's list everything.\n\n### 3.2 Inventory / Stock\n\n- Purchases marked \"Paid\" (cumulative): Become inventory\n- When equipment *sold*, cost moves to COGS (inventory decreases by \"cost amount\" per sale line; cost_amount)\n- Purchases marked \"Unpaid\": Not yet paid, but appear on inventory and in \"accounts payable\"\n- For *inventory*, include all purchases (Paid and Unpaid), subtract out **cost of goods sold** (cost_amount per sale line).\n- Equipment purchases that are *fixed asset purchase* are **not** inventory.\n\n### 3.3 Accounts Receivable\n\n- Sum of all sales \"Unpaid\": outstanding receivables.\n\n### 3.4 Interest Receivable\n\n- Sum of all \"Interest Receivables\" lines.\n\n---\n\nLet's proceed to sum up each major component.\n\n---\n\n## Part 1: Calculate Inventory Value\n\n### 1. Total Purchases (for RESALE, i.e. not fixed asset purchase):\n\nAll lines with:\n - type == Purchase, sum amount\n - both Paid and Unpaid purchases are included as inventory, since stock is on hand regardless of payment\n - FixedAsset type: Fixed Assets Purchase: **not** inventory\n\nAdd **amount** for all purchases (ignore fixed asset purchases).\n\n| id                | type     | amount      |\n|-------------------|----------|-------------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | Purchase | 1,000,000   |\n| Purchase20231231002 | Purchase | 1,000,000   |\n| Purchase20231231003 | Purchase | 1,000,000   |\n| Purchase20231231004 | Purchase | 1,500,000   |\n| Purchase20231231005 | Purchase | 3,000,000   |\n| Purchase20231231006 | Purchase | 1,600,000   |\n| Purchase20231231007 | Purchase | 800,000     |\n| Purchase20231231008 | Purchase | 1,000,000   |\n| Purchase20231231009 | Purchase | 1,600,000   |\n| Purchase20231231010 | Purchase | 1,500,000   |\n| Purchase20231231011 | Purchase | 500,000     |\n| Purchase20231231012 | Purchase | 1,600,000   |\n| Purchase20231231013 | Purchase | 500,000     |\n| Purchase20231231014 | Purchase | 1,500,000   |\n| Purchase20231231015 | Purchase | 3,000,000   |\n| Purchase20231231016 | Purchase | 2,000,000   |\n| Purchase20231231017 | Purchase | 1,500,000   |\n| Purchase20231231018 | Purchase | 3,000,000   |\n\nNow sum:\n\n1,000,000  \n+1,000,000  \n+1,000,000  \n+1,500,000  \n+3,000,000  \n+1,600,000  \n+800,000  \n+1,000,000  \n+1,600,000  \n+1,500,000  \n+500,000  \n+1,600,000  \n+500,000  \n+1,500,000  \n+3,000,000  \n+2,000,000  \n+1,500,000  \n+3,000,000  \n\nLet's add up:\n\n1M*3 = 3,000,000  \n1.5M*3 = 4,500,000  \n3.0M*3 = 9,000,000  \n1.6M*3 = 4,800,000  \n0.8M = 800,000  \n0.5M*2 = 1,000,000  \n2.0M = 2,000,000\n\nSum up:\n\n- 3M (the three 1M)\n- 4.5M (the three 1.5M)\n- 9M (the three 3M)\n- 4.8M (the three 1.6M)\n- 0.8M\n- 1.0M\n- 2.0M\n\nSo:\n\n3.0  \n+4.5 = 7.5  \n+9.0 = 16.5  \n+4.8 = 21.3  \n+0.8 = 22.1  \n+1.0 = 23.1  \n+2.0 = 25.1\n\n**Total Purchases = 25,100,000**\n\nCheck quick sum: (just for reassurance, let's sum in order):\n\n1,000,000 (1)  \n+1,000,000 (2) → 2,000,000  \n+1,000,000 (3) → 3,000,000  \n+1,500,000 (4) → 4,500,000  \n+3,000,000 (5) → 7,500,000  \n+1,600,000 (6) → 9,100,000  \n+800,000 (7) → 9,900,000  \n+1,000,000 (8) → 10,900,000  \n+1,600,000 (9) → 12,500,000  \n+1,500,000 (10) → 14,000,000  \n+500,000 (11) → 14,500,000  \n+1,600,000 (12) → 16,100,000  \n+500,000 (13) → 16,600,000  \n+1,500,000 (14) → 18,100,000  \n+3,000,000 (15) → 21,100,000  \n+2,000,000 (16) → 23,100,000  \n+1,500,000 (17) → 24,600,000  \n+3,000,000 (18) → 27,600,000\n\nWait: this is **27,600,000**.\n\nThe first summary above gave 25.1M, but line by line it totals 27,600,000.\n\nThus, **Total Purchases for Resale (Inventory): 27,600,000**\n\n### 2.
