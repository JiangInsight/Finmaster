So, the AP only increases during the period by the sum of the above \"Unpaid\" purchases.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Increase (Decrease) in AP:**\n\nSum the amounts from above:\n- Purchase20231231002:      1,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231008:      1,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231012:      1,600,000.0\n- Purchase20231231018:      3,000,000.0\n\nTotal Increase = 1,000,000.0 + 1,000,000.0 + 1,600,000.0 + 3,000,000.0 = **6,600,000.0**\n\n**Step 5: Answer Formatting**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"6600000.00\"} }\n```",
