                        "content": "Let's follow the accounting logic step by step:\n\n### 1. **Initial Value Calculation (as of 2023-12-31)**\nWe construct the initial balance sheet assets, since:\n**Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity = Total Assets** (by the balance sheet equation).\n\n#### a) Initial asset records:\n- Cash deposit: **5,000,000.00**\n- Bank deposit: **15,000,000.00**\n- Fixed Assets: **8,000,000.00**\n\nSum of initial assets:\n> 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = **28,000,000.00**\n\n**Therefore, \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity Initial Value\":**  \n> **28,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### 2. **End Value Calculation (as of last transaction 2024-02-05)**\n\n#### a) Step 1: **Find Ending Asset Value**\n\n##### i. **Starting Assets**\n- Cash: 5,000,000\n- Bank: 15,000,000\n- Fixed Assets: 8,000,000\n> **Total start: 28,000,000**\n\n##### ii. **Purchases of Fixed Assets (New Additions)**\nAll lines with \"Fixed Assets Purchase\":\n- 2023-12-31, S008, Fixed Asset: **758,493.61**\n- 2023-12-31, S009, Fixed Asset: **1,721,500.92**\n\n> **Sum new fixed assets:**\n> 758,493.61 + 1,721,500.92 = **2,479,994.53**\n> Add to previous \"Fixed Assets\": 8,000,000 + 2,479,994.53 = **10,479,994.53**\n\n##### iii. **Transactions that Affect Bank and Cash**\nFirst, recognize that transfer between bank and cash (\"cash to bank transfer\", \"bank to cash transfer\") **do not affect total assets**.  \nSo, skip those, as they net out to zero in total assets.\n\n##### iv. **Purchases (Inventory/Fixed Asset purchases)**\nAll purchases with \"Paid\" status will **reduce cash or bank** (since inventory is consumed when sold, but unsold inventory remains an asset).\n- But in this business, purchases are large equipment (fixed asset–like), given the \"Heavy Equipment\" names. However, sometimes \"Paid\" is direct asset (for sale), sometimes the purchased items are held for sale.\n- For simplification, let's treat all large equipment purchases as inventory assets (current asset) until sold.\n\nA full inventory tracking for each piece is ideal, but let's track assets (inventory + cash/bank + AR + interest receivable + fixed assets) over time with Sales and Purchases.\n\nLet's do it stepwise:\n\n---\n\n#### b) **Asset Calculation Table Overview**  \n**We will compute:**\n- Cash + Bank\n- Inventory (purchased, unsold items)\n- Accounts Receivable (unpaid sales)\n- Interest Receivable (sum up all positive entries under \"Interest Receivables\" minus negative entries)\n- Fixed Assets (including new purchases, minus depreciation)\n- **Total Assets = sum above at period end**\n\n---\n\n##### **Step 1: Purchases (add inventory)**\n\n**All Purchases and Fixed Asset Purchases:**  \n(Paid or Unpaid; if Unpaid, create an account payable liability instead of reducing cash/bank.)\n\nLet's sum all purchases (excluding \"Fixed Assets Purchase,\" which we already added to fixed assets):\n\n| id            | amount     | payment_status | Unpaid? | Notes
