                        "content": "Let's follow the accounting logic step by step:\n\n### 1. **Initial Value Calculation (as of 2023-12-31)**\nWe construct the initial balance sheet assets, since:\n**Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity = Total Assets** (by the balance sheet equation).\n\n#### a) Initial asset records:\n- Cash deposit: **5,000,000.00**\n- Bank deposit: **15,000,000.00**\n- Fixed Assets: **8,000,000.00**\n\nSum of initial assets:\n> 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = **28,000,000.00**\n\n**Therefore, \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity Initial Value\":**  \n> **28,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### 2. **End Value Calculation (as of last transaction 2024-02-05)**\n\n#### a) Step 1: **Find Ending Asset Value**\n\n##### i. **Starting Assets**\n- Cash: 5,000,000\n- Bank: 15,000,000\n- Fixed Assets: 8,000,000\n> **Total start: 28,000,000**\n\n##### ii. **Purchases of Fixed Assets (New Additions)**\nAll lines with \"Fixed Assets Purchase\":\n- 2023-12-31, S008, Fixed Asset: **758,493.61**\n- 2023-12-31, S009, Fixed Asset: **1,721,500.92**\n\n> **Sum new fixed assets:**\n> 758,493.61 + 1,721,500.92 = **2,479,994.53**\n> Add to previous \"Fixed Assets\": 8,000,000 + 2,479,994.53 = **10,479,994.53**\n\n##### iii. **Transactions that Affect Bank and Cash**\nFirst, recognize that transfer between bank and cash (\"cash to bank transfer\", \"bank to cash transfer\") **do not affect total assets**.  \nSo, skip those, as they net out to zero in total assets.\n\n##### iv. **Purchases (Inventory/Fixed Asset purchases)**\nAll purchases with \"Paid\" status will **reduce cash or bank** (since inventory is consumed when sold, but unsold inventory remains an asset).\n- But in this business, purchases are large equipment (fixed assetâ€“like), given the \"Heavy Equipment\" names. However, sometimes \"Paid\" is direct asset (for sale), sometimes the purchased items are held for sale.\n- For simplification, let's treat all large equipment purchases as inventory assets (current asset) until sold.\n\nA full inventory tracking for each piece is ideal, but let's track assets (inventory + cash/bank + AR + interest receivable + fixed assets) over time with Sales and Purchases.\n\nLet's do it stepwise:\n\n---\n\n#### b) **Asset Calculation Table Overview**  \n**We will compute:**\n- Cash + Bank\n- Inventory (purchased, unsold items)\n- Accounts Receivable (unpaid sales)\n- Interest Receivable (sum up all positive entries under \"Interest Receivables\" minus negative entries)\n- Fixed Assets (including new purchases, minus depreciation)\n- **Total Assets = sum above at period end**\n\n---\n\n##### **Step 1: Purchases (add inventory)**\n\n**All Purchases and Fixed Asset Purchases:**  \n(Paid or Unpaid; if Unpaid, create an account payable liability instead of reducing cash/bank.)\n\nLet's sum all purchases (excluding \"Fixed Assets Purchase,\" which we already added to fixed assets):\n\n| id            | amount     | payment_status | Unpaid? | Notes
