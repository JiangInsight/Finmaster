Definition of Paid-in Capital\nPaid-in capital (also called share capital or contributed capital) is the amount of money the shareholders have invested in the company by purchasing the company's shares. This is commonly found in **Initial** entries as deposits at company founding or as capital increases.\n\nIt does NOT change due to normal operational activities (purchases, sales, expenses, etc.) unless explicitly stated as an additional capital injection.\n\n## 2. Identify Paid-in Capital Transactions\n\nLook for **Initial** entries, which often reflect the contributed capital on company setup. These can be in the form of cash, bank deposits, or non-cash assets (like equipment or buildings) provided by shareholders.\n\n### Find Initial Records\n\nFrom the data:\n```\n| Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit    | ... | 5,000,000.0  | ... |\n| Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit    | ... | 15,000,000.0 | ... |\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets    | ... | 8,000,000.0  | ... |\n```\n\n- Cash deposit:        5,000,000.0\n- Bank deposit:       15,000,000.0\n- Fixed Assets:        8,000,000.0\n\nTotal = 5,000,000.0 + 15,000,000.0 + 8,000,000.0 = **28,000,000.0**\n\n## 3. Were there any changes to Paid-in Capital later?\n\nAll subsequent entries are sales, purchases, expenses, interest, transfers, depreciation, etc.\n**No additional capital contributions or capital reductions are present.**\n\nThus, **Paid-in Capital does NOT change** after the initial entry.\n\n## 4. Summary\n\n- **Initial Paid-in Capital**: 28,000,000.00\n- **Final Paid-in Capital**:   28,000,000.00\n\n## Output\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '28000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '28000000.00'} }\n```",
