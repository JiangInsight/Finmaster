                        "content": "Let's break down the task step by step to calculate the Purchase of Fixed Assets for the cash flow statement.\n\n### 1. Understanding the task\n- The \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the cash flow statement only considers *actual cash paid for fixed assets during the period*.\n- This includes only transactions that are for **fixed assets**, are **cash or bank transfer paid**, and are not unpaid/account payable.\n- Purchases of inventory or normal products, administrative expenses, sales, transfers, depreciation, and interests are all excluded.\n\n### 2. Identify relevant transactions\n- Look for lines indicating actual payment for **fixed assets**. There are two kinds in the data set:\n    1. Rows with type **\"Fixed Assets Purchase\"** (easiest to identify, usually directly fixed asset investments)\n    2. Purchases of products that are actually fixed assets (\"Heavy Equipment\", \"Production Line Equipment\", \"Industrial Facilities\", etc.), only if paid (not Account Payable/Unpaid)!\n\n#### Details from the data:\n- **FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | ... | 1721500.92 | ... | Paid**\n- **FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | ... | 758493.61 | ... | Paid**\nAll other \"Fixed Assets\" rows are under \"Initial...\" â€” these are **initial balances** and not current period purchases, so they are not included.\n\n#### Purchases of fixed assets via \"Purchase\" rows (if paid and for fixed asset items)\nLet's check all \"Purchase...\" rows on 2023-12-31 for items that are actually fixed assets (e.g. Heavy Equipment... etc.), only if they are **paid** and via **Bank Transfer or Cash** (not Unpaid/Account Payable):\n\n| id                 | Type      | Date        | Amount      | Paid/Unpaid   | Payment Method  | Product Name           |\n|--------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|\n| Purchase20231231001| Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 1000000.0   | Paid          | Bank Transfer   | Heavy Equipment C      |\n| Purchase20231231003| Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 1000000.0   | Paid          | Bank Transfer   | Heavy Equipment C      |\n| Purchase20231231004| Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 1500000.0   | Paid          | Cash            | Heavy Equipment D      |\n| Purchase20231231005| Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 3000000.0   | Paid          | Cash            | Heavy Equipment D      |\n| Purchase20231231006| Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 1600000.0   | Paid          | Bank Transfer   | Heavy Equipment B      |\n| Purchase20231231007| Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 800000.0    | Paid          | Bank Transfer   | Heavy Equipment B      |\n| Purchase20231231009| Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 1600000.0   | Paid          | Bank Transfer   | Heavy Equipment B      |\n| Purchase20231231010| Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 1500000.0   | Paid          | Bank Transfer   | Heavy Equipment D      |\n| Purchase20231231011| Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 500000.0    | Paid          | Bank Transfer   | Heavy Equipment A      |\n| Purchase20231231013| Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 500000.0    | Paid          | Bank Transfer   | Heavy Equipment A      |\n| Purchase20231231014| Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 1500000.0   | Paid          | Bank Transfer   | Heavy Equipment D      |\n| Purchase20231231015| Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 3000000.0   | Paid          | Bank Transfer   | Heavy Equipment D      |\n| Purchase20231231016| Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 2000000.0   | Paid          | Cash            | Heavy Equipment C      |\n| Purchase20231231017| Purchase  | 2023-12-31  | 1500000.0   | Paid          | Bank Transfer   | Heavy Equipment D      |\n\n**Note:** Rows with \"Unpaid\" (Account Payable) are NOT included in cash flow statement now.\n\n#### Purchases that are \"Unpaid\"/Account Payable or for other products (not fixed assets):\n- Ignore unpaid purchases (`Purchase20231231002`, `Purchase20231231008`, `Purchase20231231012`, `Purchase20231231018`)\n- Ignore purchases of items that are not fixed assets\n\n### 3. List all cash outflows for fixed assets purchase\n\nLet's get ALL relevant amounts.\n\n#### (A) Direct purchases with \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" type (full amount paid):\n- 1721500.92\n- 758493.61\n\n#### (B) Paid fixed asset purchases from \"Purchase\" records (the full amount in \"amount\" column; all these are \"paid\"):\n- 1000000.0\n- 1000000.0\n- 1500000.0\n- 3000000.0\n- 1600000.0\n- 800000.0\n- 1600000.0\n- 1500000.0\n- 500000.0\n- 500000.0\n- 1500000.0\n- 3000000.0\n- 2000000.0\n- 1500000.0\n\n#### Now, sum all these up:\nFixed Assets Purchases (Paid):\n- 1721500.92 [A]\n- 758493.61   [A]\n- 1000000.0   [B]\n- 1000000.0   [B]\n- 1500000.0   [B]\n- 3000000.0   [B]\n- 1600000.0   [B]\n- 800000.0    [B]\n- 1600000.0   [B]\n- 1500000.0   [B]\n- 500000.0    [B]\n- 500000.0    [B]\n- 1500000.0   [B]\n- 3000000.0   [B]\n- 2000000.0   [B]\n- 1500000.0   [B]\n\n### 4.
