Identify Relevant Transactions\n\nThe **ending cash and cash equivalents balance** is driven by:\n- **Cash deposit** and **Bank deposit** - Starting balances.\n- **Cash inflows**: receipts from sales (when marked \"Paid\" AND payment_method is Cash), bank to cash transfers.\n- **Cash outflows**: payments of expenses (Paid & payment_method Cash), purchases (Paid & payment_method Cash), fixed asset purchases (Paid & method Cash), cash to bank transfers.\n- **Bank inflows**: receipts from sales (when Paid and payment_method Bank Transfer), bank to cash transfers.\n- **Bank outflows**: purchases & expenses paid from bank, fixed asset purchases (Paid & method Bank Transfer), cash to bank transfers.\n\n**Note**: \n- *Interest Receivable* entries are all \"Unpaid\": Do not affect cash.\n- *Depreciation* entries: No cash movement.\n- Only \"Paid\" entries count for cash movement. \"Unpaid\" (typically for account receivable/payable) have no immediate cash effect.\n\nWe are to sum up both **cash and bank balances**, i.e., total cash equivalents.\n\n## 2.
