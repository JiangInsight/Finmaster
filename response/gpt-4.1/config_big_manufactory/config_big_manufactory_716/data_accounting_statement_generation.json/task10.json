But note, since every time you purchase, you add to the asset, and every cost you sell, you remove. Most of the assets are purchased+sold, but still, a large ending balance makes sense if more assets were purchased than sold.**\n\nHowever, let's double-check if any double counting or miscategorization.\n\n#### *Are all \"Purchase\" asset purchases or do some belong to inventory?*\n\nLooking at the \"product_name\" field, all value, quantity, and supplier for purchases here are clearly heavy equipment, all in low unit quantities (like 1, 2, etc.), and all high unit prices (>500,000). So yes, these are non-current assets and not inventory.\n\nSimilarly, the sales of \"Heavy Equipment\" units (again, unit=1, total value, with explicit cost_amount per sale) must be disposals of those assets.\n\n#### *Any other adjustments?*\n\n- \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" (two lines): these refer to other non-current assets, like \"Industrial Facilities\", \"Production Line Equipment\", which are also non-current assets, and only their depreciation should be subtracted.\n\n- \"Depreciation\" is only two lines, so total depreciation above is correct.\n\n#### *Any assets still in stock?*  \nAssets purchased but not yet sold remain on the balance sheet.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n- Initial non-current assets: **8,000,000.00**\n- Plus total purchases:       **+30,079,994.53**\n- Minus all sold asset costs: **-20,200,000.00**\n- Minus depreciation:         **-120,970.16**\n\n**= 7,759,024.37**\n\nWait, the subtotal above was 17 million, but in my last calculation it's much lower. There must be a calculation mismatch; let's add accurately one more time for purchases.\n\n---\n\n#### Let's recalculate all purchases (**exclude possible duplicates**):\n\n| ID                  | Product        | Quantity | Unit Price   | Amount       |\n|---------------------|---------------|----------|--------------|--------------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | C             | 1        | 1,000,000    | 1,000,000    |\n| Purchase20231231002 | C             | 1        | 1,000,000    | 1,000,000    |\n| Purchase20231231003 | C             | 1        | 1,000,000    | 1,000,000    |\n| Purchase20231231004 | D             | 1        | 1,500,000    | 1,500,000    |\n| Purchase20231231005 | D             | 2        | 1,500,000    | 3,000,000    |\n| Purchase20231231006 | B             | 2        | 800,000      | 1,600,000    |\n| Purchase20231231007 | B             | 1        | 800,000      | 800,000      |\n| Purchase20231231008 | A             | 2        | 500,000      | 1,000,000    |\n| Purchase20231231009 | B             | 2        | 800,000      | 1,600,000    |\n| Purchase20231231010 | D             | 1        | 1,500,000    | 1,500,000    |\n| Purchase20231231011 | A             | 1        | 500,000      | 500,000      |\n| Purchase20231231012 | B             | 2        | 800,000      | 1,600,000    |\n| Purchase20231231013 | A             | 1        | 500,000      | 500,000      |\n| Purchase20231231014 | D             | 1        | 1,500,000    | 1,500,000    |\n| Purchase20231231015 | D             | 2        | 1,500,000    | 3,000,000    |\n| Purchase20231231016 | C             | 2        | 1,000,000    | 2,000,000    |\n| Purchase20231231017 | D             | 1        | 1,500,000    | 1,500,000    |\n| Purchase20231231018 | D             | 2        | 1,500,000    | 3,000,000    |\n\nSum of amounts (purchases only):  \n1,000,000  \n+1,000,000 = 2,000,000  \n+1,000,000 = 3,000,000  \n+1,500,000 = 4,500,000  \n+3,000,000 = 7,500,000  \n+1,600,000 = 9,100,000  \n+800,000  = 9,900,000  \n+1,000,000 = 10,900,000  \n+1,600,000 = 12,500,000  \n+1,500,000 = 14,000,000  \n+500,000  = 14,500,000  \n+1,600,000 = 16,100,000  \n+500,000  = 16,600,000  \n+1,500,000 = 18,100,000  \n+3,000,000 = 21,100,000  \n+2,000,000 = 23,100,000  \n+1,500,000 = 24,600,000  \n+3,000,000 = **27,600,000**\n\nNow add the two \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" rows:  \n+758,493.61 = 28,358,493.61  \n+1,721,500.92 = **30,079,994.53**\n\nSo, the sum is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Depreciation**\n\nAlready summed, as above:  \n= 45,749.96 + 75,220.20 = 120,970.16\n\n---\n\n### **Disposals**\n\nList each single occurrence of a sale of a piece of equipment and the cost. Already summed at  \n= 20,200,000.00\n\n---\n\n### **Final Calculation**\n\nInitial Value: 8,000,000.00  \n+ Purchases: 30,079,994.53  \n- Disposals: 20,200,000.00  \n- Depreciation: 120,970.16  \n\n= 8,000,000.00 + 30,079,994.53 = 38,079,994.53  \n38,079,994.53 - 20,200,000.00 = 17,879,994.53  \n17,879,994.53 - 120,970.16   = **17,759,024.37**\n\n---\n\n### But Stock Consistency Check\n\nNotice that in most company scenarios, new purchases almost all immediately sold (unless company is a dealer, but these are non-current assets). The only *additional* lines are the two \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" which seems to be for equipment not sold -- their depreciation is only relevant amount taken off.\n\nThe net non-current assets left are those not sold. It could be that only the Production Line Equipment and Industrial Facilities (total value: 758,493.61 + 1,721,500.92 = 2,480,000) remain and all heavy equipment is purchased and sold (how many purchased vs sold?).\n\nCount heavy equipment purchased vs sold:\n\nPurchases of Heavy Equipment:\nSum of quantity for Heavy Equipment A, B, C, D:\n\n- A: Purchases (2 + 1 + 1) = 4 units\n- B: Purchases (2 + 1 + 2 + 2) = 7 units\n- C: (1 + 1 + 1 + 2) = 5 units\n- D: (1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2) = 9 units\n\nFrom sales, sum how many of each is disposed:\n\n- A: Sale (1 + 1) = 2 units\n- B: (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 5 units\n- C: (1 + 1 + 1) = 3 units\n- D: (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 8 units\n\nSo, units remaining:\n\n- A: 4 - 2 = 2 units \n- B: 7 - 5 = 2 units \n- C: 5 - 3 = 2 units \n- D: 9 - 8 = 1 unit\n\nSo, for each, sum up the cost of the remaining units (take lowest possible cost if unknown which ones remain).\n\nA: All units purchased for 500,000 (since unit price for all purchases of A were 500,000)\n- So 2 units * 500,000 = 1,000,000\n\nB: All purchased for 800,000; 2 units remain\n- 2 * 800,000 = 1,600,000\n\nC: Two units remain; purchases made at 1,000,000/unit.\n- 2 * 1,000,000 = 2,000,000\n\nD: One unit remains (purchased at 1,500,000)\n- 1 * 1,500,000 = 1,500,000\n\nAdd up remaining non-current assets:\n\nA: 1,000,000  \nB: 1,600,000  \nC: 2,000,000  \nD: 1,500,000\n\nSum: 1,000,000 + 1,600,000 = 2,600,000  \n+ 2,000,000 = 4,600,000  \n+ 1,500,000 = 6,100,000  \n\nNow add the two \"Fixed Asset Purchases\":\n\n+ 758,493.61 (Production Line Equipment) = 6,858,493.61  \n+ 1,721,500.92 (Industrial Facilities) = 8,579,994.53\n\nNow, subtract accumulated depreciation from these:\n\nNote: The depreciation likely applies only to these two (Production Line Equipment and Industrial Facilities) as the heavy equipment is probably treated as entirely depreciated on disposal.\n\nAdd up cost:\nProduction Line Equipment: 758,493.61  \nIndustrial Facilities: 1,721,500.92  \nSum: 2,480,000.53\n\nIf both items are subject to depreciation (unlikely that any of the heavy equipment remaining has recognized depreciation, since none is sold), then total accumulated depreciation is 120,970.16. But unless specified, we'd have to allocate.\n\nSo total cost remaining:\n6,100,000 (Heavy Equipment)  \n+2,480,000.53 (other fixed assets) = 8,580,000.53\n\nMinus depreciation: 8,580,000.53 - 120,970.16 = 8,459,030.37\n\nSo, **ending balance = 8,459,030.37**\n\n---\n\n### Round and present as per requested format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\",\n  \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"8459030.37\"\n}}\n```\n\n---\n\n#### **Final answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"8459030.37\"}}\n```",
