Common current liabilities in such transaction data include:\n- **Accounts Payable (\"Unpaid\"/\"Account Payable\")**\n- **Other Payables/Short Term Loans (not present here unless specified)**\n- **Interest Payables (rare, unless specifically stated)**\nWe do NOT count equity, nor operational expenses, nor paid purchases.\n\n### 2. **Find Initial Value (as of start, from \"Initial\" rows)**\n\nLook at all \"Initial\" rows.\n\n- | Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit          | ... | amount: 5000000   | \n- | Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit          | ... | amount: 15000000  | \n- | Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets          | ... | amount: 8000000   | \n\n**None** of the initial records is a liability (cash, bank, and fixed assets are assets).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Total Liabilities Initial Value = 0.00**\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Find Final Value (as of latest date)**\n\n- **Relevant 'liabilities' in this dataset = unpaid Purchases (\"Account Payable\")**\n\nLet's look for \"Unpaid\" and \"Account Payable\" purchases:\n\n#### Find all UNPAID purchases (\"Account Payable\"):\n\n#### Scan through “Purchase” and look at “payment/receipt_status”, \"payment_method\", \"amount\":\n\n#### Let's capture all lines with **Unpaid** status, and **Account Payable**\n\n#### First, gather all “Purchase” lines:\n\n| id                 | type     | ... | amount      | payment/receipt_status | payment_method   |\n|--------------------|----------|-----|-------------|-----------------------|------------------|\n| Purchase20231231002| Purchase | ... | 1000000.0   | Unpaid                | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231008| Purchase | ... | 1000000.0   | Unpaid                | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231012| Purchase | ... | 1600000.0   | Unpaid                | Account Payable  |\n| Purchase20231231018| Purchase | ... | 3000000.0   | Unpaid                | Account Payable  |\n\n(Other purchase lines either have Paid/Bank Transfer/Cash as payment status and method)\n\nSum up all \"Unpaid\"/\"Account Payable\" purchase amounts:\n\n1000000.0  \n+ 1000000.0  \n+ 1600000.0  \n+ 3000000.0  \n= **6600000.0**\n\n#### Is there any other liability type present?\n- No obvious \"loans\" or \"interest payable\" in the data—interest receivable lines impact assets, not liabilities.\n\n#### Any other unpaid liabilities? \n- \"Interest Receivables\" = asset, not a liability.\n\n#### Double-check for other possible 'unpaid' entries that create liabilities:\nAll other \"Unpaid\" appear only on sales, in Account Receivable (which is an asset).\nNo other kind of unpaid lines are possible liabilities.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Does any of these \"Account Payable\" get paid off during the period?**\nLet's check if there were payment entries for above Account Payable lines.\n\nNo purchases with \"Paid\" status referencing these same purchase IDs.  \nPaid purchases are for other items or already marked as \"Paid\".\n\nSo, the ending value for liabilities is the sum of all outstanding \"Account Payable\" purchases identified above.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Final Answer**\n\nFormat as requested:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', 'Total Liabilities End Value': '6600000.00'} }\n```\n\n#### **Explanation**\n- **Initial Value:** 0.00 (no initial liabilities)\n- **End Value:** Sum of all unpaid purchases on account payable (totaling 6,600,000)\n\n---\n\n## Final Solution\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', 'Total Liabilities End Value': '6600000.00'} }\n```",
