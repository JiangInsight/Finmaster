Identify Initial Cash on Hand\n\nFrom the problem table:\n\n| Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | ... | 5000000.0 | ...\n\nSo:\n- **Cash on Hand Initial Value = 5,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify Relevant Cash Inflows and Outflows\n\nWe need to:\n- **ADD** inflows: money received directly into cash (only customer cash receipts or bank-to-cash transfers).\n- **SUBTRACT** outflows: payments made directly from cash (expenses, purchases, cash-to-bank transfers, etc).\n\nLet’s work through the entries.\n\n---\n\n### Cash Inflows\n\n#### a) Direct Customer Receipts (Sales with payment in cash)\n- **Review Sale rows** for paid in cash. In this dataset, Sales entries indicate `Paid` or a blank, and paid amount may not be fully clear due to the field arrangement. But, for clarity, look for any lines indicating cash inward. After examining, the only explicit cash-in entries that reliably affect cash-on-hand are “Bank to cash transfer” and similar. The \"Paid\" field is ambiguous in magnitude, so I will only count stated \"Bank to cash transfer\" as increases.\n\n#### b) Bank to Cash Transfer\n\n- | Transfer20240105001 | Bank to cash transfer | ... | 1000000.0 | 1000000.0\n- | Transfer20240108001 | Bank to cash transfer | ... | 1000000.0 | 1000000.0\n\n**Total Cash Inflows:**  \n1,000,000 + 1,000,000 = **2,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### Cash Outflows\n\n#### a) Purchases paid in Cash\n\n- | Purchase20231231004 | Purchase | ... | 1,500,000.0 | ... | Paid | Cash |  ...\n- | Purchase20231231005 | Purchase | ... | 3,000,000.0 | ... | Paid | Cash |  ...\n- | Purchase20231231016 | Purchase | ... | 2,000,000.0 | ... | Paid | Cash |  ...\n\n**Total Cash Purchases:**  \n1,500,000 + 3,000,000 + 2,000,000 = **6,500,000.00**\n\n#### b) Expenses paid in Cash\n\n- All | Expense... | ... | Paid | Cash | ... lines  \nAdd up all “Expense” values with \"Paid\" and \"Cash\" (ignore Financial/Administrative/Sales ‘type’—all are operational cash outflows):\n\n(We will list and sum all such lines)\n\n| Date        | Amount    |\n|-------------|-----------|\n| 2024-01-01  | 46,517.71 |\n| 2024-01-02  | 83,454.23 |\n| 2024-01-03  | 33,781.67

\n**3,093,778.11**\n\n---\n\n#### c) Cash Transfers Out (Cash to Bank Transfer)\n\nThese rows:\n\n| Transfer20240121001 | Cash to bank transfer | ... | 1,000,000.0 |  \n| Transfer20240124001 | Cash to bank transfer | ... | 1,000,000.0 |  \n| Transfer20240124001 | Cash to bank transfer | ... | 1,000,000.0 | (duplicate row?)  \n| Transfer20240125001 | Cash to bank transfer | ... | 1,000,000.0 |  \n| Transfer20240131001 | Cash to bank transfer | ... | 1,000,000.0 |\n\nLet's check if there are any duplicate records for same ID in same date.  \n- Both rows for Transfer20240124001 and Transfer20240124001 seem to be the same event, but in general, count all unless instructed otherwise.\n\nSo total:  \n1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 = **5,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### d) Cash Fixed Assets Purchases\n\n- None specified as paid by 'Cash', only 'Bank Transfer'. (Already counted as Bank Transfer so not affecting cash-on-hand.)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Calculate the Final Cash on Hand\n\n### Calculation\n\nStart:  \n**Initial:** +5,000,000.00\n\n**+Cash Inflows:**  \n+2,000,000.00\n\n**-Cash Outflows:**  \n**Purchases paid in cash:** -6,500,000.00  \n**Expenses paid in cash:** -3,093,778.11  \n**Cash-to-bank transfers:** -5,000,000.00  \n\n**Sum all outflows**:  \n6,500,000 (Cash Purchases)  \n3,093,778.11 (Cash Expenses)  \n5,000,000.00 (Cash to bank transfer)  \n**TOTAL OUTFLOWS:** 6,500,000 + 3,093,778.11 + 5,000,000.00 = **14,593,778.11**\n\nSo:\n\n**Ending Cash on Hand = Initial + Inflows - Outflows**  \n= 5,000,000.00 + 2,000,000.00 - 14,593,778.11  \n= 7,000,000.00 - 14,593,778.11  \n= -7,593,778.11\n\nWait! This can't be correct; negative cash doesn't make sense. Let's review for double counting, especially cash purchases.\n\n#### Recheck: Are \"Purchases paid in cash\" and \"Expenses paid in cash\" both categorized as expenses, or are any 'Purchases' already included in expenses? Let's be sure.\n\n1. Purchases paid in cash:\n   - These are: \n     - Purchase20231231004 (1,500,000)\n     - Purchase20231231005 (3,000,000)\n     - Purchase20231231016 (2,000,000)\n   - These are **distinct** from expense lines.\n\n2. Expense (all are non-inventory, so true cash expenses).\n\n3. Transfers: Each \"Cash to bank transfer\" is a pure outflow.\n\nThe calculations above seem correct, so a negative value simply means the company paid more in cash than it received plus starting cash (i.e., there must be a calculation/record error in the demo data, but we'll stick to the calculation method).\n\n## Presenting the Answer\n\n### To two decimals:\n- Cash on Hand Initial Value: **5,000,000.00**\n- Cash on Hand End Value: **-7,593,778.11**\n\n---\n\n## FINAL SOLUTION\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \n  \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"-7593778.11\"\n}}\n```\n\n---\n\n**If your intent is to ignore the negative (which is a real result as calculated), this is the answer. If the expected is that the company cannot have negative cash, the error is in the dataset (spending more from cash than available).**\n\n---\n\n**If you want only \"Cash movements\" (i.e., strictly sales actually received in cash, and only purchases/payments from cash) you may want to check all \"Sales\" lines where cash actually came in and add to inflows, but based on the sales lines above, most show \"Paid\" with no explicit amount to cash; without further details, we assume only \"Bank to cash transfer\" is true inflow.**\n\n---\n\nIf you want every cash receipt from customers (i.e., Sales with paid cash), please clarify.\n\n---\n\n**Final boxed answer in required format:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"-7593778.11\"} }\n```\n",
