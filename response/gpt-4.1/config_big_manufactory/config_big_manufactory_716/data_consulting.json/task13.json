Standard practice is to use the available figures. If the initial is genuinely zero (e.g., start of operations), the ratio is typically very high or not meaningful. However, matching to your examples, including the case with 0 initial inventory used as average, the average is as above (0+ending)/2.\n\nBut let's compute and present the answer according to these numbers:\n\n- Average Inventory = (0 + 7,400,000) / 2 = 3,700,000\n- COGS = 20,200,000\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = 20,200,000 / 3,700,000 = 5.46\n\n**On second thought:**\nIn your given example, you said:\n- Initial Inventory: 0\n- Ending Inventory: 5,090,000\n- Average: (0 + 5,090,000)/2 = 2,545,000\n- COGS: 4,410,000\n- Ratio: 4,410,000/2,545,000 = 1.73\n\nTherefore, using this logic:\n\n**Our answer:**\n- 20,200,000 / 3,700,000 = **5.46** (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"5.46\"}}\n```\n\n**Final Answer**  \nInventory Turnover Ratio: 5.46",
