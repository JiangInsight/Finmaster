In the standard financial statement structure, these costs are typically recorded under \"Selling Expenses\" (sometimes also labeled as \"Sales and Distribution Expenses\" or similar). The reason is that selling expenses include costs related to securing customer orders (such as marketing, advertising, commissions) and freight/outbound logistics for delivering goods/services.\n\nLooking at the income statement provided, the line item \"Selling Expenses\" is present with an amount of **1,461,486.34**. Thus, the answer is:\n\n\"value\": \"1461486.34\"",
