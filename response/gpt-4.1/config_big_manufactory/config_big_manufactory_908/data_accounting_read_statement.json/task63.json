Identify and extract:\n### (a) The three specific line items and end value of:\n#### i. Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the principal revenue-producing activities of the entity and other activities that are not investing or financing activities\n- This refers to \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" (from the Cash Flow Statement).  \n**Value = -16772398.72**\n\n#### ii. The amount of taxes accrued but not yet paid\n- This refers to \"Taxes Payable\" (end value) (from Balance Sheet).\n**Value = 1143833.89**\n\n#### iii. Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities\n- This refers to \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue\" (from the Income Statement)\n**Value = 22876677.56**\n\n## 2. Multiple outputs: group by financial statement order, but give the values in the requested order as in the example:\n- value1: Taxes accrued but not yet paid (from Balance Sheet) --> 1143833.89\n- value2: Total income arising from ordinary activities (from Income Statement) --> 22876677.56\n- value3: Net cash flow from operating activities (from Cash Flow Statement) --> -16772398.72\n\n## 3. Final Output\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1143833.89', 'value2': '22876677.56', 'value3': '-16772398.72'} }\n```",
