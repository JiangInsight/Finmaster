Explanation:**\n\n- **Checking for internal inconsistencies:** \n    - For most rows the fields are consistent with their invoice text—e.g., Purchase with proper unit price × quantity = amount, types matching etc.\n- **Identifying and outputting inconsistencies:**\n    - For \"Sale20240108007\", row type is \"Depreciation\" but fields and invoice correspond to a Sale transaction for Heavy Equipment C. Product, price, amount, and even the invoice description (\"sale\") is inconsistent.\n    - The amount, price, and category are mismatched — invoice says unit price 1 × 1460946.33 = 1,460,946.33, but amount is 1,633,150.89 and recorded price is 1,351,250.7.\n    - Thus, report both the \"category\" (should be \"Sale\"), the \"amount\" (should be 1460946.33 per invoice), and the \"unit price\" (should be 1460946.33 per invoice), and mark the \"id\".\n- **For initial capital**, the rows are all part of an opening balance breakdown but shown as \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\" etc.; likely, this is a breakdown of a single capital contribution—but as per invoice, nothing is mismatched.\n\n**Note:** You can output all consistent rows, but the main errors are as above; only rows with mismatches must be fully filled in.\n\nIf you only want to output the **error rows solely**, remove the non-error ones (as done in the previous example), and only list the Sale20240108007 (and in your previous sample, Sale20240114023). If you want a full scan, all rows can be listed in your template above.",
