For **Initial20231231001**, there are three mutually exclusive entries using the same transaction ID for \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", and \"Fixed Assets\", each with a different amount. However, the invoice (trusted) matches the amount for \"Cash deposit\" and \"Bank deposit\" in different rows elsewhere, but here only \"Cash deposit\" with $5,000,000.00 matches the invoice. The presence of three rows for mutually exclusive initial transactions with the same ID indicates an inconsistency: possibly only one (the \"Cash deposit\") should exist, or amounts/splits are wrong.\n   - The best estimate: category should be only \"Cash deposit\"; the category/amount/ID usage is unreliable in current records.\n\n2. For **Sale20240205041**, as flagged in the risk_issues:\n   - The invoice says: \"On February 05, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $1,428,329.11, totaling $1,428,329.11\". However, the record has:\n     - recorded_quantity: 0.0 (should be 1.0)\n     - recorded_unit_price: 1,694,235.32 (should be 1,428,329.11)\n     - recorded_amount: 1,726,773.12 (should be 1,428,329.11)\n     - recorded_date: 2024-02-21 (should be 2024-02-05)\n   - All these fields mismatch what the authoritative invoice states. These are therefore internal inconsistencies.\n\nNo other clear internal field mismatches (calculation errors, or unit/amount/ID mismatch relative to invoice) are apparent from the problem. If more entries with similar risk_issues notes were given, they would be handled in similar fashion.",
