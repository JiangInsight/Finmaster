According to proper bookkeeping and the example in the prompt, an initial capital input (i.e. for startup/initial transaction) should sum up across Cash, Bank, and Fixed Assets. But the values in the \"recorded\" fields do not match with what would be expected in the invoiceâ€”*on 2023-12-31, the invoice says Cash deposit $5,000,000. Bank deposit $15,000,000. Fixed Assets $8,000,000.* The \"Cash deposit\" row incorrectly lists 5m in the original and \"Bank deposit\" as 15m; so one is misentered as the other. The repeated ID and the amounts mismatch.  \n- For `Expense20240116001`, the recorded date is 2024-01-29, but the invoice says January 16, 2024. The recorded amount is 19978.89, but the invoice amount is $16,712.52. Therefore, both amount and date are mismatched between the entry and the invoice (which, per instructions, is more reliable).\n- All other entries either have matching values between invoice and row, or have no sufficient mismatch to flag.\n- For the second \"Fixed Assets\" record (with 8m), while the fields agree, this is just a mapping from invoice to table.\n- In all cases (using the examples), the invoice text value is considered the \"original\" (correct) value.\n\nIf further detail or more inconsistencies are to be included, let me know!",
