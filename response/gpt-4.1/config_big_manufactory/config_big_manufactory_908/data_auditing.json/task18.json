Initial20231231001\n- This ID appears three times, once each for Cash deposit, Bank deposit, and Fixed Assets, each with differing amounts.\n- The invoice for each matches that entry: i.e., invoice matches \"Cash deposit, $5000000.00\", \"Bank deposit, $15000000.00\", and \"Fixed Assets, $8000000.00\".\n- This indicates that there are three different transactions in the invoice, all under the same ID. This is unusual, as generally, each type should have a unique ID, unless they're part of a grouped entry. But given the examples, this format is accepted.\n- So, no inconsistency **within each row**, but the grouping under same id might be questionable. However, as per the pattern, this is accepted as per the input.\n\n### 2. Sale20240123026\n- **recorded_quantity**: 0.0, but invoice says \"1.0 units\".\n- **recorded_amount**: 0.0, but invoice says \"710732.40\".\n- **recorded_profit**: 253946.08, but invoice calculation is 710732.4 - 500000 (cost) = 210732.4.\n- **recorded_payment/receipt_status**: \"Unpaid\" but invoice says \"this transaction was paid\".\n\n### 3. Other Examples\n- All other entries (administrative, sales/financial expenses, purchases, sales with matching invoice, fixed asset) **correctly match the invoice** and their row entries.\n\n#### For completeness:\n- The solution only lists real inconsistencies found (see above).  \n- For rows with no inconsistencies, just leave empty.\n\n#### About field names in output:\n- Used names from the provided columns.\n- For grouped field inconsistencies, bundled as needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Only Sale20240123026 has internal row inconsistency compared to the invoice, for quantity, amount, profit, and payment status.  \n- The repeated Initial20231231001 group is accepted per examples, though best practice is unique IDs per transaction type.  \n- All other rows are consistent.  \n\nIf you need only the actual inconsistencies found (i.e. not just a placeholder for every row), the above answer is concise and targeted.",
