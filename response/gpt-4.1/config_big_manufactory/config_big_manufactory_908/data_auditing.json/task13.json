Strictly per your instructions and considering \"invoice\" reliable, no internal field-level inconsistencies are spotted *within* each row as amounts match, so individual rows are internally OK, but logically, all three make up a capital injection (imprecisely labeled as 'Cash deposit', etc.). You could argue the 'Original category' should be 'Initial Capital Injection' as per standard accounting classification.\n\n2. **Sale20240117018** — The row is marked as \"Purchase\" in the `recorded_type` (category), but the invoice text and context suggest it is actually a \"Sale.\" Also, the recorded tax amount is listed as 1,258,161.28, but according to the invoice and calculation (sale amount minus after-tax amount), the tax is actually 56,232.65. The \"original\" category should be \"Sale\" and the original tax should be 56,232.65.\n\nNo other internal row-level inconsistencies are found where the invoice and row data don't match. Common minor formatting/typology mismatches (e.g. \"Account Receviable\" vs. \"Account Receivable\") are ignored for the purpose of your specific task focus.\n\nIf you need to focus only on rows where the *recorded* values do not match the *invoice*-stated or calculated values within the specific row, **only Sale20240117018 has such a clear internal contradiction.** Let me know if you prefer a shorter or more comprehensive explanation!",
