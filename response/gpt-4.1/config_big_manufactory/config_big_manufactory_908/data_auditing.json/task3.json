The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\" This indicates the invoice (high reliability field) marks the transaction as \"unpaid\".\n- However, the \"recorded_payment/receipt_status\" field in the row is \"Paid\".\n\n**Correction:**\n- The correct value for \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\" should be \"Unpaid\" (Original payment/receipt_status = 'Unpaid').\n- All other fields either match invoice, or are not specified or compared in this individual row based on invoice data.\n- Therefore, only the payment/receipt status field is actually inconsistent/error here.",
