In the invoices for the Cash deposit and Bank deposit, the values are $5000000.00 and $15000000.00 respectively. These match the nature and uniqueness; but in the row for Fixed Assets, $8000000.00 is given, which is inconsistent, as all three cannot be part of the same single transaction ID for initial capital (should not triple-count). Hence, at least one must be misrecorded or misunderstood.\n\n    However, the **primary distinct inconsistency** (as referenced in the risk/issues) is that sometimes the 'Bank deposit' is $15000000.00, sometimes $5000000.00 for the same id and date (see input), suggesting a duplicated or swapped value.\n\n- For \"Purchase20231231014\", the invoice says \"a Purchase, consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $1,000,000.00, totaling $2,000,000.00. The payment_method of this transaction was bank transfer, and this transaction was paid.\" The record, however, says 1.0 unit and unpaid. That's an internal data error: the correct value should be 2 units and status 'Paid' per the invoice.\n\n**Only material inconsistencies distinctly evidenced by the trustworthy invoice notes are reported above. Other lines are consistent within their recorded information and the invoice narrative.**\n\nIf you want all such inconsistencies listed in your requested flat field way (per your template):\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Purchase', 'Recorded category': 'Purchase', 'Original date': '2023-12-31', 'Recorded date': '2023-12-31', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': 'Bank Transfer', 'Recorded payment_method': 'Bank Transfer', 'Original quantity': '2.00', 'Recorded quantity': '1.00', 'Original price': '1000000.00', 'Recorded price': '1000000.00', 'Original receive_method': None, 'Recorded receive_method': None, 'Original amount': '2000000.00', 'Recorded amount': '1000000.00', 'Original tax': None, 'Recorded tax': None, 'Original profit': None, 'Recorded profit': None, 'Original Preparer': 'Staff', 'Recorded Preparer': 'Staff', 'Original Approver': 'Director', 'Recorded Approver': 'Director', 'id': 'Purchase20231231014'}}\n```\n\n**For the Initial... rows, as the breakdown is not atomizable to that template, they are best listed as above. But for explicit misrecordings (like the Purchase), the full breakdown can be provided.**",
