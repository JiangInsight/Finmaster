According to the invoice (standardized reference), the amounts should be:**\n    - Cash deposit: $5,000,000.00 (row 1),\n    - Bank deposit: $5,000,000.00 or, in some cases, possibly $15,000,000.00, but likely a copy/paste input error (row 2),\n    - Fixed Assets: $8,000,000.00 (row 3).\n   Reviewing expected initial capital splits, it's likely Cash and Bank deposit should sum to the total of Fixed Assets, but amounts don't add up. Presumable correct amounts (using invoice, and usual accounting patterns) would be:\n    - Cash deposit: $3,000,000.00 (frequently in similar data), but $5,000,000.00 here.\n    - Bank deposit: The most likely error, this should also reflect a split, and $15,000,000 is likely a typo or mis-entry for $5,000,000.00.\n2. **Sale20240125027:**\n    - In the table: amount $2,490,267.91, price/unit $2,337,228.22, but invoice shows 1 unit Ã— $2,008,346.63 = $2,008,346.63 (so amount and unit price do not match).\n    - Correction: Amount and unit price should both match $2,008,346.63.\n3. The remaining transactions match their invoice-based or internal consistency, so no further inconsistencies are found.\n4. Note: Some original entries may have ambiguous \"original\" category; set to null if undefined (as in the sample).\n\n**If you would like these strictly as only the ones with a unit price/unit/amount mathematical mismatch, or want missing/copy rows (e.g. Bank to cash and vice versa) listed, let me know and I can elaborate more granularly.**",
