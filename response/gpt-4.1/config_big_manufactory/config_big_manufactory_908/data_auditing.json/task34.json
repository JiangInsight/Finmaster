The cost amount for this transaction was $1,000,000.00, with a tax amount of $74,468.29, leading to a total amount due of $1,414,897.50. The receive_method... and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n- The **recorded data** has:\n  - recorded_type: Administrative Expenses (should be Sale)\n  - recorded_date: 2024-01-14 (should be 2024-01-09)\n  - recorded_quantity: 0.0 (should be 1.0)\n  - recorded_unit_price: 1,612,315.03 (should be 1,489,365.79)\n  - recorded_amount: 0.0 (should be 1,489,365.79)\n  - recorded_tax_amount: 1,205,714.62 (should be 74,468.29)\n  - recorded_after_tax_amount: 1,414,897.50 (matches invoice, correct)\n  - recorded_cost_amount: 1,000,000 (correct)\n  - recorded_profit: 489,365.79 (should be correct as per invoice, but double-check math)\n  - recorded_receive_method: Account Receviable (matches invoice)\n- Therefore, the mismatches are in category/type, date, quantity, amount, unit price, and tax. The \"Original\" values all come from the invoice sentence; \"Recorded\" are as per the table entry.\n```",
