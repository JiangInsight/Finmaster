id=Purchase20231231004:** The \"Recorded Approver\" is blank but invoice/risk_issues and all similar entries indicate Director is always the approver, so it should be 'Director'.\n2. **Initial20231231001** repeated three times with different asset/account types (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets), but in each case, according to the invoice, the amounts should match to the proper asset: if the invoice says $3,000,000 for Cash deposit, but the amount is $5,000,000 in the record, it's an inconsistency. In your case data for problem, the invoice amount for \"Cash deposit\" is missing, but in the problem statement, it says $5,000,000. If the invoice says $5,000,000 in the description, it's not necessarily inconsistent, but the problem text shows a difference between \"Cash deposit\" and \"Bank deposit\" from the example—so you would compare the invoice text with the amount.\n3. For other records, Recorded Approver must match invoice (Director), but in id \"Purchase20231231004\" it’s missing.\n\nThe entries above illustrate the main example of error detected per your guidance (especially example provided at the end). If you expected a specific inconsistency not caught above, please clarify which row or field. If you want ALL field-by-field reiteration even when not in error, clarify that as well!",
