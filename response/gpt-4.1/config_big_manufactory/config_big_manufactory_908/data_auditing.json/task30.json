The cost amount for this transaction was $1,000,000.00, with a tax amount of $69,226.62, leading to a total amount due of $1,315,305.82. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- But in the main row fields:\n    - recorded_type: \"Purchase\" (should be \"Sale\")\n    - recorded_amount: \"1,606,738.25\" (should be \"1,384,532.44\")\n    - recorded_unit_price: \"1,293,419.65\" (should be \"1,384,532.44\")\n    - recorded_tax_amount: \"1,292,386.07\" (should be \"69,226.62\") **(clearly an error; tax is almost equal to main amount!)**\n    - recorded_receive_method: \"\" (should be \"Cash\")\n- Quantity and cost amount are correct.\n- Profit field is only present in records, not invoice, so was left as recorded value.\n\nIf there are more inconsistencies you would like analyzed, provide their data and I will format accordingly.",
