However, the description in the invoice for each line says: \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a [respective type], totaling $[amount].\" thus matching the `recorded_category` and `recorded_amount` for each line with its \"invoice\" description.\n- The issue is that under good accounting practice, a transaction ID should refer to one specific transaction, but here, three distinct types/deposit categories and amounts are being logged under the same ID.\n- Therefore, for each combination of two lines with shared IDs, there is an internal inconsistency, meaning that for a given transaction ID, there should be a unique (or decomposed) \"category\" and \"amount\".\n\n**Extra note:**  \nThere are other types of recurring or duplicate entries (like for cash/bank transfer lines), but they repeat identical information, not conflicting information (i.e., not inconsistent between fields within a single row or between different rows for the same ID with conflicting fields).  \nThe above 3 entries are the only ones in this example where the same transaction ID refers to completely different `type` and `amount`, in contradiction with standardized invoice information per line.",
