The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n- The field in `recorded_receive_method` is \"Cash\", but should be \"Interest receviable\" as per the invoice and for consistency with all other Interest Receivables entries (which have their receive method as \"Interest receviable\").\n- The rest of the fields are consistent.\n- Therefore, the only inconsistency is in `recorded_receive_method`, which should be \"Interest receviable\" and not \"Cash\". The risk_issues column already notes this.\n- All other fields are either correct or not relevant to this specific error.\n\n**Thus, the correct solution is as above.**",
