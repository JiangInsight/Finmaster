However, the invoice states 'Cash deposit, totaling $5000000.00.'

Possible miscalculation or data entry error. Tax and after-tax amounts are likely not related to profit as defined (profit here is simply sales - cost).\"\n  }\n]}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- The main internal inconsistency in the data regards duplicate or conflicting 'Initial20231231001' entries for opening balances. The values could be duplicative or misallocated, as only one opening entry per asset type should appear.\n- For Sale20240125027, the profit calculation is directly verifiable and does not match; the correct profit should be sales minus cost per the supporting invoice.\n- Some transfer transactions (Cash/Bank to bank/cash transfer with identical dates and amounts, e.g., on Jan 23-27) are not included here as errors without further info, as such transfers may legitimately have multiple entries (e.g., dual-sided inter-account moves).\n- No other specific invoice-to-row field mismatches (e.g., quantity, amount, payment method) are found in the provided sample.\n- For other fields, either the invoice and row match, or if errors are systemic (like multiple staff/preparer for expenses), it's not sufficiently contradictory to output as error based only on available data.\n\n**For each detected inconsistency, the expected output includes id, fields, recorded and correct value, and reasoning, as requested.**",
