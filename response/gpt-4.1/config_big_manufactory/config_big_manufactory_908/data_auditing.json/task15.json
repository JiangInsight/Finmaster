1-3): The invoice narrations and transaction IDs indicate that the initial capital entry is split across Cash deposit, Bank deposit, and Fixed Assets. However, the amounts for Cash deposit and Bank deposit do not match their respective narrations:\n    - The Cash deposit row's amount is $5,000,000.00, matching its narration.\n    - The Bank deposit row, however, is $15,000,000.00, but the narration for the same transaction elsewhere claims Bank deposit should be $5,000,000.00 and vice versa.\n    - This suggests the amounts for Cash deposit and Bank deposit are swapped. Thus, for both rows, amounts are inconsistent with narrations and should be reversed.\n\n2. **Sale20240117018**: This row is categorized as \"Depreciation\" with 0 quantity and 0 amount, but the invoice/narration describes a sale of 1.0 units at $1,124,652.91. This is a classic mismatch; the row should be a \"Sale\" with correct quantity and amount. Thus, category and quantity fields are wrong.\n\n*For all other rows, unless the narration (which is standardized and corroborated with detailed line info) disagrees with the recorded columns, there are no clear internal inconsistencies or errors to correct. For example, purchases/sales with unit price Ã— quantity matching the amount, correct status for AP/AR, etc.*\n\n*If more errors are spotted or further rows need explicit treatment, they would follow the same structure as above.*\n\n---\n\nIf you want only the *actual detected errors* with populated fields, you can remove the last item in the array, which is left blank above as a placeholder.",
