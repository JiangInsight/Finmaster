Current Ratio\nFormula:  \nCurrent Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\n- Total Current Assets = 22,474,420.77\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n- Current Ratio = 22,474,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 7.15\n\n#### 2. Quick Ratio\nFormula:  \nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\n- Inventory = 6,600,000.00\n- (Current Assets - Inventory) = 22,474,420.77 - 6,600,000.00 = 15,874,420.77\n- Quick Ratio = 15,874,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 5.05\n\n#### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\nFormula:  \nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n  (No non-current/debt listed, so all liabilities are current)\n- Total Assets = 33,082,821.36\n- Debt to Asset Ratio = 3,143,833.89 / 33,082,821.36 ≈ 0.10\n\n#### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\nFormula:  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity\n\n- Total Owner's Equity = 29,938,987.47\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = 3,143,833.89 / 29,938,987.47 ≈ 0.11\n\n#### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nFormula:  \nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Liabilities\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -16,772,398.72\n- Total Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ -5.34\n\nAll ratios rounded to two decimal places as customary in financial analysis.",
