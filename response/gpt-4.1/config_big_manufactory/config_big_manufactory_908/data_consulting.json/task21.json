Free Cash Flow (FCF):**\n\n- From the cash flow statement:\n  - Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents = Ending Balance - Beginning Balance = 498,569.02 - 20,000,000.00 = -19,501,430.98\n  - Also, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -16,772,398.72\n  - Net Cash Flow from Investing = -2,729,032.26\n- FCF is typically calculated as:  \n  FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures (or Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n  FCF = -16,772,398.72 - 2,729,032.26 = -19,501,430.98\n\nSo, FCF = **-19,501,430.98** (matches the net decrease in cash).\n\n---\n\n**2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio:**\n\n- Formula:  \n  Current Assets Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Average Current Assets\n- Revenue = 22,876,677.56\n- Average Current Assets = (Beginning + Ending) / 2  \n  = (20,000,000.00 + 22,474,420.77) / 2  \n  = 42,474,420.77 / 2  \n  = 21,237,210.385\n\n- Turnover Ratio = 22,876,677.56 / 21,237,210.385 ≈ **1.08**\n\nHowever, in the example above for a similar problem, the denominator was calculated as the **ending** Total Current Assets. But in standard accounting, the average should be used.\n\nBut let's check:  \nUsing ending current assets:\n22,876,677.56 / 22,474,420.77 ≈ 1.02\n\nIn the provided example, they used **ending** current assets, so to be consistent:\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Ending Current Assets  \n= 22,876,677.56 / 22,474,420.77 ≈ **1.02**\n\n---\n\n**Final Answers:**\n\n- Free Cash Flow (FCF): **-19,501,430.98**\n- Current Assets Turnover Ratio: **1.02**",
