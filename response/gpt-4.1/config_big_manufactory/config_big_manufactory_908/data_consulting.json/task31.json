Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n= Total Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n- Total Revenue = 22,876,677.56\n- Beginning AR = 0. Ending AR = 15,362,611.64\n- Avg AR = (0 + 15,362,611.64)/2 = 7,681,305.82\n\n**Ratio = 22,876,677.56 / 7,681,305.82 = 2.98**\n\n**However in the example, initial AR is zero and they used ending AR. So, to be consistent:**\n**= Revenue / Ending AR = 22,876,677.56 / 15,362,611.64 = 1.49**\n\n**But the example used average. So final answer:**\n**= 22,876,677.56 / 7,681,305.82 = 2.98**\n\nBut the example divides revenue by average AR (example: 5,431,018.59/(0+2,429,482.13)/2=4.47). So:\n**= 22,876,677.56 / 7,681,305.82 = 2.98**\n\n#### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n= Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Ending Current Liabilities\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -16,772,398.72\n- Current Liabilities (End) = 3,143,833.89\n\nRatio = -16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 = **-5.34**\n\n#### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nSame as above: **-5.34**\n\n#### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n= Total Revenue / Average Total Assets\n\n- Total Revenue = 22,876,677.56\n- Average Total Assets = (28,000,000.00 + 33,082,821.36)/2 = 30,541,410.68\n\n= 22,876,677.56 / 30,541,410.68 = **0.75**\n\n#### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n= Total Liabilities / Owner's Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities (End) = Total Assets - Owner's Equity = 33,082,821.36 - 29,938,987.47 = 3,143,833.89\n- Owner's Equity (End) = 29,938,987.47\n\n= 3,143,833.89 / 29,938,987.47 = **0.11**\n```\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.98\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-5.34\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-5.34\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.75\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\"\n} }\n```\n***Note: If you use ending AR only, ratio would be 1.49. Following the sample reasoning, average is preferred. If you want a different denominator for debt/equity, let me know!***",
