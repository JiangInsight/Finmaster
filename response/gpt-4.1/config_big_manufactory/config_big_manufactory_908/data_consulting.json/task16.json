But if you match the ratio in the provided solution (\"0.41\" for about 0.407), rounding 0.7495 to 0.75 is correct.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.75\"} }\n```\n\n*Note: If you require three significant digits as in the example (e.g., \"0.41\"), then you could also show 0.75. If two decimals are expected, the above answer is correct. If you did not want rounding, the answer would be 0.749.*",
