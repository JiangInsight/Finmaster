In this case:\n\n   = -16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ -5.34 (but for consistency, we'll keep two decimals so as not to understate the negative ratio).\n\nBut the example also seems to use ending value for \"Total Current Liabilities\" (which is correct).\n\n**Final answers:**  \n- Gross Profit Margin: 28.33%  \n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -5.34\n\nBut you requested the format as in your example (showing only one decimal for Operating Cash Flow Ratio), so the answer should be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Gross Profit Margin\": \"28.33%\", \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-5.34\"} }\n```\n\n**Note**:  \nIf the intent was to format it exactly as in the sample example (1 decimal for OCF ratio), then use -5.3. But since the sample answer says \"-3.90\", round to two decimals.\n\n**Corrected final answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Gross Profit Margin\": \"28.33%\", \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-5.34\"} }\n```",
