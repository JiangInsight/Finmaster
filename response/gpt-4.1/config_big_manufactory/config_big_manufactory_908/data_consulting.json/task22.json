Quick Ratio Calculation:**  \nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities  \nFrom balance sheet as of 2024-02-05:  \n- Current Assets = 22,474,420.77  \n- Inventory = 6,600,000.00  \n- Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89  \n\nSo,  \nQuick Ratio = (22,474,420.77 - 6,600,000) / 3,143,833.89  \nQuick Ratio = 15,874,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 5.05  \n\nHowever, let's clarify the quick assets:  \nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable  \n= 627,601.28 + (Bank Deposits: -129,032.26) + 15,362,611.64 + 13,240.11  \n= 627,601.28 - 129,032.26 + 15,362,611.64 + 13,240.11  \n= (627,601.28 - 129,032.26) = 498,569.02  \nSo,  \nQuick Assets = 498,569.02 + 15,362,611.64 + 13,240.11 = 15,874,420.77  \n\nTherefore, Quick Ratio = 15,874,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 5.05  \n\n*But, in the total current assets, they are including negative bank deposits (overdraft), which deducts cash. For consistency with previous logic (from the example), simply using the quick assets as above is appropriate.*\n\n**2. Net Profit Margin Calculation:**  \nNet Profit Margin = Net Profit / Total Revenue  \nFrom income statement:  \n- Net Profit = 1,938,987.47  \n- Total Revenue = 22,876,677.56  \n\nNet Profit Margin = 1,938,987.47 / 22,876,677.56 ≈ 0.0848 = 8.48%  \n\n**Correction:**  \nThe quick ratio calculated above matches the numerator and denominator logic from the example, so the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Quick Ratio\": \"5.05\", \"Net Profit Margin\": \"8.48%\"}}\n```\n\n(Your example result for the Quick Ratio is with numerator 6,388,205.47 / 1,861,550.92 = 3.43 in the previous, but the table content and logic for \"Quick Assets\" is as explained above. Thus, the correct Quick Ratio = (Current Assets minus Inventory)/Current Liabilities = 15,874,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 = 5.05.)",
