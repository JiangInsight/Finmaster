Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n= Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / End Total Current Liabilities  \n= -16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89  \n= **-5.34**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n= End Total Liabilities / End Total Equity  \nTotal Liabilities: End Total Liabilities = End Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89 (since no LT Liab)  \nTotal Equity: 29,938,987.47  \n= 3,143,833.89 / 29,938,987.47  \n≈ **0.10**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n= Revenue / Average Total Assets  \nBeginning Total Assets: 28,000,000.00  \nEnding Total Assets: 33,082,821.36  \nAverage Total Assets = (28,000,000 + 33,082,821.36)/2 = 30,541,410.68  \nRevenue = 22,876,677.56  \n= 22,876,677.56 / 30,541,410.68  \n≈ **0.75** (rounded to two decimals: **0.75**)  \nOops, prior calculation was 0.75, but original answer said 0.73. Let's double-check:\n\n22,876,677.56 / 30,541,410.68 = 0.7493 ≈ **0.75**\n\nBut to be consistent with example, use two decimals: **0.75**\n\n---\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\nQuick Assets = Cash + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable  \n= 627,601.28 + (–129,032.26) + 13,240.11 + 15,362,611.64 =  \n= 627,601.28 – 129,032.26 + 13,240.11 + 15,362,611.64  \n= (627,601.28 – 129,032.26) = 498,569.02  \n498,569.02 + 13,240.11 = 511,809.13  \n511,809.13 + 15,362,611.64 = 15,874,420.77  \n\nQuick Assets: 15,874,420.77  \nCurrent Liabilities: 3,143,833.89  \n= 15,874,420.77 / 3,143,833.89  \n≈ 5.05 (rounded: **5.05**)\n\nBut note given in Balance Sheet: \"Total Current Assets\" is 22,474,420.77, so our quick assets do not include inventory of 6,600,000:\n22,474,420.77 – 6,600,000 = 15,874,420.77. So, calculation is correct.\n\nSo, **5.05**.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n= Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / End Total Current Liabilities  \n= -16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89  \n= **-5.34**  \n\n(same as #1, based on example structure)\n\n---\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n= Net Profit / Average Equity  \nNet Profit: 1,938,987.47  \nAverage Equity: (28,000,000.00 + 29,938,987.47) / 2 = 28,969,493.73  \nROE = 1,938,987.47 / 28,969,493.73 = 0.06694 = **6.69%**\n\n---\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n= Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nStart AR: 0; End AR: 15,362,611.64 ⇒ Avg = (0 + 15,362,611.64)/2 = 7,681,305.82  \nTurnover = 22,876,677.56 / 7,681,305.82 = 2.98\n\n**But in the example, the denominator was not Revenue / Average AR, but Revenue / End AR. Let's check: Example above: Revenue: 5,431,018.59; AR: 2,429,482.13, answer: 4.47 ⇒ 5,431,018.59/1,214,741.07=4.47. But that's Revenue / (AR/2), i.e. average AR.**\n\nSo, use average AR.\n\n= 22,876,677.56 / 7,681,305.82 = **2.98**\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer (after review):**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-5.34\", \n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.10\", \n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.75\", \n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"5.05\", \n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-5.34\", \n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"6.69%\", \n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.98\"\n}}\n```",
