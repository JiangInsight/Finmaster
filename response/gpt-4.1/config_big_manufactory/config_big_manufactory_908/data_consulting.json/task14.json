Sometimes, when starting A/R is 0, the turnover ratio becomes:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{ART Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Ending A/R}}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{22,876,677.56}{15,362,611.64} \\approx 1.49\n   \\]\n\n   However, the previous example did use the average, for consistency, use average:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{22,876,677.56}{7,681,305.82} = 2.98\n   \\]\n\n   But the example in prompt had an AR turnover ratio of 4.47 with:\n   - Sales: 5,431,018.59\n   - Average AR: (0+2,429,482.13)/2 = 1,214,741.07\n   - 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.07 = 4.47 (matches)\n\n   Use average AR method.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{ART Ratio} = \\frac{22,876,677.56}{7,681,305.82} = 2.98\n   \\]\n\n**Corrected Calculation (with full decimal precision):**\n\n- Net Sales: 22,876,677.56\n- Average A/R: (0.00 + 15,362,611.64) / 2 = 7,681,305.82\n\n\\[\nART = \\frac{22,876,677.56}{7,681,305.82} = 2.98\n\\]\n\n**Final JSON:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.98\"} }\n```",
