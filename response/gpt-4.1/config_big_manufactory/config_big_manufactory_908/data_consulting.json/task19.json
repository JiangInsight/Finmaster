Calculate Current Ratio:\n\n- **Formula:**  \n  Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\n- **From balance sheet (as of 2024-02-05):**  \n  - Total Current Assets = 22,474,420.77  \n  - Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  22,474,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 â‰ˆ 7.155\n\n- **Final answer (rounded to two decimals):**  \n  **Current Ratio = 7.15**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Calculate Inventory Turnover Ratio:\n\n- **Formula:**  \n  Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory\n\n- **From statements:**  \n  - COGS = 16,400,000.00 (from income statement)\n  - Beginning Inventory (as of 2023-12-31) = 0.00  \n  - Ending Inventory (as of 2024-02-05) = 6,600,000.00\n\n  - Average Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2  \n    = (0 + 6,600,000) / 2 = 3,300,000.00\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  16,400,000.00 / 3,300,000.00 = 4.97\n\n- However, COGS relates to the change in inventory over the period.  \n  Since beginning inventory is zero, entire inventory purchased is not yet sold.  \n  The ratio will be lower due to high ending inventory, but calculation above is standard.\n\n- **But check consistency with example:**  \n  In the example, the turnover ratio is calculated as:  \n  Inventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory  \n  COGS = 4,410,000  \n  Beginning = 0  \n  Ending = 5,090,000  \n  Average = 0 + 5,090,000 / 2 = 2,545,000  \n  4,410,000 / 2,545,000 = 1.732 (~ matches 1.73 in example).\n\n- **Apply the same method:**\n  16,400,000 / 3,300,000 = **4.97**\n\n- **But let's check whether the period COGS corresponds to the change in inventory.**\n  Here, company started with zero inventory, purchased or produced 6,600,000 of ending inventory, while selling COGS of 16,400,000. The high COGS compared to average inventory is possible due to rapid turnover; since beginning inventory is zero, all sales are from purchases during the period.\n\n- **So K**eep with standard formula for matching example:\n  **Inventory Turnover Ratio = 4.97**\n\nBut in the example, the denominator is computed as (beginning + ending) / 2, even if beginning inventory is 0. So this approach is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **However, error!**  \nUpon reviewing the example, the inventory turnover is much lower than my calculation, but in example, COGS is 4,410,000 and average inventory is (0+5,090,000)/2=2,545,000, 4,410,000/2,545,000 = 1.73.\n\nIn our problem:\nCOGS = 16,400,000  \nAverage Inventory = (0+6,600,000)/2 = 3,300,000\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 16,400,000 / 3,300,000 = **4.97**\n\nBut let's check further: COGS is for the period, inventory at end is 6,600,000, at beginning is zero, so perhaps the company just stocked a lot of inventory during this period.\n\n**Final Answers:**\n- Current Ratio: 22,474,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 = **7.15** (rounded to two decimals)\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio: 16,400,000 / 3,300,000 = **4.97** (rounded to two decimals)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Current Ratio\": \"7.15\", \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"4.97\"} }\n```\n\n**Note:**  \nIf you wish to match the significant digits (2 decimals) as in the example, this is the finalized format. If you want to keep more digits, you may write \"7.155\", but \"7.15\" matches the typical display.",
