In this case, only current liabilities are listed:\n     - **Total Current Liabilities (End of Period)**: 3,143,833.89\n\n2. **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities** (from Cash Flow Statement):  \n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = **-16,772,398.72**\n\n3. **Plug in the values:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-16,772,398.72}{3,143,833.89} = -5.34\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   - The Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is **-5.34**.\n   - This negative value indicates that operating cash flow was negative and in absolute terms much larger than debt, reflecting an inability to cover debts from operations during this period.\n```",
