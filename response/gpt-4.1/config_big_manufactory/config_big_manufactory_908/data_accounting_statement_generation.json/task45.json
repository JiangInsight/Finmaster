                        "content": "Let's break down the steps to calculate \"Net Cash Flows from Investing Activities\" according to the cash flow statement:\n\n**Step 1: What is included in Investing Activities?**\n- Cash paid to acquire fixed assets, intangible assets, and other long-term assets (outflow)\n- Cash received from disposal of fixed assets, intangible assets, and other long-term assets (inflow)\n- Cash used for acquiring/selling long-term investments (not present here)\n- Usually, purchases/sales of items like \"Heavy Equipment\" are considered fixed assets for most businesses unless these are inventories for trading. Given these are large-value \"equipment\" and the company has \"Fixed Assets\" on its balance sheet, these purchases/sales seem to be treated as fixed asset activities.\n\n**Step 2: Identify all cash flows for fixed assets (heavy equipment, machinery, facilities)**\n- Only paid purchases/sales are recognized in the period for cash flow statement (exclude unpaid/account payable).\n\n#### A) Cash Outflows (Purchase of fixed assets):\n\nIdentify lines with type \"Purchase\" or \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or \"Fixed Assets\" that are \"Paid\" and related to equipment/machinery/facilities.\n\nLet's add those up:\n\n- Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | amount 8,000,000.0 (no payment status, likely opening balance, **not a cash flow in this period.**)\n- Purchase20231231001 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 2,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231002 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 1,500,000.0\n- Purchase20231231003 | Paid | Cash | 1,600,000.0\n- Purchase20231231004 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 500,000.0\n- Purchase20231231005 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 1,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231006 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 1,500,000.0\n- Purchase20231231008 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 1,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231009 | Paid | Cash | 1,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231010 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 800,000.0\n- Purchase20231231011 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 1,600,000.0\n- Purchase20231231012 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 500,000.0\n- Purchase20231231014 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 2,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231015 | Paid | Cash | 1,500,000.0\n- Purchase20231231016 | Paid | Cash | 1,500,000.0\n- Purchase20231231017 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 3,000,000.0\n\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | Paid | Bank Transfer | 1,219,968.64\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | Paid | Bank Transfer | 1,509,063.62\n\n**Cash Outflows Sum:**\nLet's add all \"Paid\" purchases & fixed asset purchases (exclude \"Initial...\" and \"Unpaid/Account Payable\"):\n\n2,000,000.00  \n1,500,000.00  \n1,600,000.00  \n500,000.00  \n1,000,000.00  \n1,500,000.00  \n1,000,000.00  \n1,000,000.00  \n800,000.00  \n1,600,000.00  \n500,000.00  \n2,000,000.00  \n1,500,000.00  \n1,500,000.00  \n3,000,000.00  \n1,219,968.64  \n1,509,063.62  \n\nLet's calculate step by step:\n\n-  2,000,000.00\n+ 1,500,000.00 = 3,500,000.00\n+ 1,600,000.00 = 5,100,000.00\n+    500,000.00 = 5,600,000.00\n+ 1,000,000.00 = 6,600,000.00\n+ 1,500,000.00 = 8,100,000.00\n+ 1,000,000.00 = 9,100,000.00\n+ 1,000,000.00 = 10,100,000.00\n+    800,000.00 = 10,900,000.00\n+ 1,600,000.00 = 12,500,000.00\n+    500,000.00 = 13,000,000.00\n+ 2,000,000.00 = 15,000,000.00\n+ 1,500,000.00 = 16,500,000.00\n+ 1,500,000.00 = 18,000,000.00\n+ 3,000,000.00 = 21,000,000.00\n+ 1,219,968.64 = 22,219,968.64\n+ 1,509,063.62 = **23,729,032.26**\n\n#### B) Cash Inflows (Sales/Disposals of Fixed Assets):\n\nIdentify sales (with \"Paid\" or \"Cash\" receipt/Bank Transfer for sale of heavy equipment/machinery):\n\nFrom data, these lines have relevant \"Sale\" of heavy equipment types and specify Cash/Bank receipt:\n\n- Sale20240103002 | Sale | Unpaid | After Tax Amount: 1,307,111.59 (but \"Unpaid\" so not cash flow yet)\n- Sale20240108007 | Sale | Unpaid | After Tax Amount: 1,460,946.33 (not cash yet)\n- Sale20240109009 | Sale | Unpaid | After Tax Amount: 1,489,365.79 (not cash yet)\n- Sale20240115014 | Sale | Unpaid | After Tax Amount:   674,738.01 (not cash yet)\n- Sale20240116016 | Sale | Paid | After Tax Amount:    651,423.21 (Cash)\n- Sale20240117018 | Sale | Unpaid | After Tax Amount: 1,124,652.91 (not cash yet)\n- Sale20240118019 | Sale | Unpaid | After Tax Amount: 1,166,055.78 (not cash yet)\n- Sale20240119021 | Sale | Unpaid | After Tax Amount: 1,150,635.95 (not cash yet)\n- Sale20240120023 | Sale | Paid | After Tax Amount:    659,057.20 (Cash)\n- Sale20240122024 | Sale | Unpaid | After Tax Amount: 1,499,323.77 (not cash yet)\n- Sale20240123026 | Sale | Paid | After Tax Amount:    710,732.40 (Cash)\n- Sale20240125027 | Sale | Paid | After Tax Amount:  2,008,346.63 (Cash)\n- Sale20240128030 | Sale | Paid | After Tax Amount:  2,099,974.04 (Cash)\n- Sale20240130032 | Sale | Paid | After Tax Amount:  1,384,532.44 (Cash)\n- Sale20240202036 | Sale | Unpaid | After Tax Amount: 2,063,873.27 (not cash yet)\n- Sale20240204039 | Sale | Unpaid | After Tax Amount: 2,002,579.13 (not cash yet)\n- Sale20240205041 | Sale | Unpaid | After Tax Amount: 1,428,329.11 (not cash yet)\n\nThe only cash inflows are \"Paid\" sales, so take the following:\n\n- Sale20240116016:  651,423.21\n- Sale20240120023:  659,057.20\n- Sale20240123026:  710,732.40\n- Sale20240125027: 2,008,346.63\n- Sale20240128030: 2,099,974.04\n- Sale20240130032: 1,384,532.44\n\nLet's add these step by step:\n\n  651,423.21\n+ 659,057.20 = 1,310,480.41\n+ 710,732.40 = 2,021,212.81\n+2,008,346.63 = 4,029,559.44\n+2,099,974.04 = 6,129,533.48\n+1,384,532.44 = 7,514,065.92\n\n#### C) Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n\nNet = Cash inflows from sales -
