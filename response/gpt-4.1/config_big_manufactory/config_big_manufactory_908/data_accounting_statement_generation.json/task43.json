Cash Receipts from Customers**\nSales that are PAID (i.e., not \"Account Receivable\"/\"Unpaid\"). If \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" is payment/receive method or nothing (assume cash for immediate paid label).  \n- Most sales in this dataset are \"Unpaid\", with only a few \"Paid\" → Let's sum sales with \"Paid\".\n\n- For Sales:\n    - Only include lines with \"Sale\" and **\"Paid\"** (not \"Unpaid\").\n    - For each, take the \"amount\" column.\n\nLet's scan the Sale rows for \"Paid\":\n1. Sale20240116016 | Paid | amount = 651,423.21\n2. Sale20240120023 | Paid | amount = 659,057.2\n3. Sale20240123026 | Paid | amount = 710,732.4\n4. Sale20240125027 | Paid | amount = 2,008,346.63\n5. Sale20240128030 | Paid | amount = 2,099,974.04\n6. Sale20240130032 | Paid | amount = 1,384,532.44\n\n(Other \"Sale\" rows are \"Unpaid\" and thus DO NOT generate a cash inflow in this period)\n\n**Sum of Cash Receipts:**\n651,423.21  \n+ 659,057.20  \n+ 710,732.40  \n+ 2,008,346.63  \n+ 2,099,974.04  \n+ 1,384,532.44  \n= **7,514,066.92**\n\n**B. Payments to Suppliers for Inventory (Purchases):**  \nOnly \"Purchase\" transactions that are PAID (Cash/Bank Transfer).  \n- Ignore \"Unpaid\" purchases – only actual cash outflows count.\n\nPurchases (only \"Paid\" status):\n\n1.

Purchase20231231017 | Paid | 3,000,000.0\n\nLet's sum:\n2,000,000 +\n1,500,000 +\n1,600,000 +\n500,000 +\n1,000,000 +\n1,500,000 +\n1,000,000 +\n1,000,000 +\n800,000 +\n1,600,000 +\n500,000 +\n2,000,000 +\n1,500,000 +\n1,500,000 +\n3,000,000 =\n**20,000,000.0**\n\n**C. Cash Paid for Operating Expenses (Administrative, Sales, Financial)**\nAll \"Expense\" lines for \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Sales Expenses\", and \"Financial Expenses\" with \"Paid\" should be included.  \nIgnore depreciation -- non-cash.\n\nLet's add the expense lines:\n\n### Administrative Expenses\n(Only \"Paid\"; all seem to be paid!)\n- 27,665.22\n- 78,979.22\n- 96,158.64\n- 58,160.20\n- 16,712.52\n- 93,771.10\n- 84,202.53\n- 45,256.88\n- 96,278.36\n- 50,605.14\n- 89,152.38\n- 28,942.11\n- 54,062.11\n- 64,541.96\n- 14,646.48\n- 98,343.86\n- 18,035.41\nTotal = Let's add:\n\nStep 1:\n27,665.22 + 78,979.22 = 106,644.44  \n+ 96,158.64 = 202,803.08  \n+ 58,160.20 = 260,963.28  \n+ 16,712.52 = 277,675.80  \n+ 93,771.10 = 371,446.90  \n+ 84,202.53 = 455,649.43  \n+ 45,256.88 = 500,906.31  \n+ 96,278.36 = 597,184.67  \n+ 50,605.14 = 647,789.81  \n+ 89,152.38 = 736,942.19  \n+ 28,942.11 = 765,884.30  \n+ 54,062.11 = 819,946.41  \n+ 64,541.96 = 884,488.37  \n+ 14,646.48 = 899,134.85  \n+ 98,343.86 = 997,478.71  \n+ 18,035.41 = **1,015,514.12**\n\n### Sales Expenses\n- 93,842.8\n- 72,054.07\n- 90,710.35\n- 38,143.6\n- 15,569.62\n- 82,068.28\n- 86,165.15\n- 49,553.54\n- 77,935.63\n- 46,003.89\n- 73,389.05\n- 66,953.91\n- 66,053.33\n- 25,010.75\n- 66,279.02\n- 99,857.4\n- 99,981.12\n- 57,315.43\n- 69,500.88\n- 56,421.46\n- 39,992.76\n\nAdd up:\n\n93,842.8 + 72,054.07 = 165,896.87  \n+ 90,710.35 = 256,607.22  \n+ 38,143.6 = 294,750.82  \n+ 15,569.62 = 310,320.44  \n+ 82,068.28 = 392,388.72  \n+ 86,165.15 = 478,553.87  \n+ 49,553.54 = 528,107.41  \n+ 77,935.63 = 606,043.04  \n+ 46,003.89 = 652,046.93  \n+ 73,389.05 = 725,435.98  \n+ 66,953.91 = 792,389.89  \n+ 66,053.33 = 858,443.22  \n+ 25,010.75 = 883,453.97  \n+ 66,279.02 = 949,732.99  \n+ 99,857.4 = 1,049,590.39  \n+ 99,981.12 = 1,149,571.51  \n+ 57,315.43 = 1,206,886.94  \n+ 69,500.88 = 1,276,387.82  \n+ 56,421.46 = 1,332,809.28  \n+ 39,992.76 = **1,372,802.04**\n\n### Financial Expenses\n\n- 85,147.37\n- 80,927.47\n- 86,582.27\n- 12,485.39\n- 76,771.42\n- 92,558.72\n- 42,174.02\n- 49,152.3\n\nSum:\n\n85,147.37 + 80,927.47 = 166,074.84  \n+ 86,582.27 = 252,657.11  \n+ 12,485.39 = 265,142.5  \n+ 76,771.42 = 341,913.92  \n+ 92,558.72 = 434,472.64  \n+ 42,174.02 = 476,646.66  \n+ 49,152.3 = **525,798.96**\n\n#### Total Cash Expenses\nAdd totals:\n\n1,015,514.12 (Admin)  \n+ 1,372,802.04 (Sales)  \n+ 525,798.96 (Financial)  \n= **2,914,115.12**\n\n**D.
