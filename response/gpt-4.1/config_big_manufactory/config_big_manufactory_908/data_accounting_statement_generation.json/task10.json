Explanation Step by Step\n\n#### 1. **What constitutes non-current assets?**\n- Non-current assets typically include Fixed Assets (property, plant, equipment, heavy equipment, industrial facilities, heavy machinery, etc.)\n- Purchases of such assets count as additions.\n- Depreciation on these assets is deducted.\n- Sales of fixed assets (if any) reduce the balance by their book value.\n- Only consider transactions that affect long-term (non-current) assets, **not cash, bank, receivables, inventory, etc.**\n\n#### 2. **Initial Fixed Assets**\n- From the initial entry:\n  - \"Fixed Assets\": 8,000,000.00\n\n#### 3. **Fixed Asset Purchases After Initial**\nSum all \"Purchase\" and \"Fixed Asset Purchase\" transactions related to heavy equipment, machinery, facilities, etc.\n\n| id

These seem to be all the heavy equipment sold, each with their respective \"cost_amount\". There is no indication that the same asset was counted twice.\n\nSum of cost amounts:\n1,000,000.0 (C)\n1,000,000.0 (C)\n1,000,000.0 (C)\n  500,000.0 (A)\n  500,000.0 (A)\n  800,000.0 (B)\n  800,000.0 (B)\n  800,000.0 (B)\n  500,000.0 (A)\n1,000,000.0 (C)\n  500,000.0 (A)\n1,500,000.0 (D)\n1,500,000.0 (D)\n1,000,000.0 (C)\n1,500,000.0 (D)\n1,500,000.0 (D)\n1,000,000.0 (C)\n\nLet's add step by step:\n\n1,000,000\n+1,000,000 = 2,000,000\n+1,000,000 = 3,000,000\n+  500,000 = 3,500,000\n+  500,000 = 4,000,000\n+  800,000 = 4,800,000\n+  800,000 = 5,600,000\n+  800,000 = 6,400,000\n+  500,000 = 6,900,000\n+1,000,000 = 7,900,000\n+  500,000 = 8,400,000\n+1,500,000 = 9,900,000\n+1,500,000 = 11,400,000\n+1,000,000 = 12,400,000\n+1,500,000 = 13,900,000\n+1,500,000 = 15,400,000\n+1,000,000 = 16,400,000\n\n**Total Book Value (cost) of Sold Fixed Assets = 16,400,000.00**\n\n#### 6. **Less: Depreciation**\nFind all entries with `\"Depreciation\"` in type and subtract the \"amount\".\n\nEntries:\n- Depreciation20240101001 = 45,747.00\n- Depreciation20240201002 = 74,884.67\n\nSum:\n45,747.00 + 74,884.67 = 120,631.67\n\n---\n\n#### 7. **Final Calculation**\n\nStart with:\n- Opening Balance:         8,000,000.00\n- Add: Purchases/Capex:   25,729,032.26\n- Less: Disposals:       -16,400,000.00\n- Less: Depreciation:      -120,631.67\n\n**Final Value:**\n8,000,000.00\n+25,729,032.26 = 33,729,032.26\n-16,400,000.00 = 17,329,032.26\n-  120,631.67  = 17,208,400.59\n\n---\n\nWait: However, in the sample, all **Purchases** are counted as eventually fixed assets, even if not paid (as accounted).  \nNote: The sample says not to double-count the *initial* in case the purchase belongs to the purchased period. Here, the opening is given as at 2023-12-31, but purchases are also dated 2023-12-31: this connotes the purchases occurred **after** the opening balance (because opening is before business day starts).\n\nGiven the structure of the sample, **they are additive**, as each line is a transaction affecting the balance (not cumulative). So, this treatment is correct.\n\n---\n\nBut final sum above is **17,208,400.59**\n\nLet's check for possible non-one-off lines or asset sales.\n\n---  \n**Are there any double-counted purchases?**  \n- All purchases are with heavy equipment/facility assets—no overlap (IDs, amounts, suppliers) found.\n- All \"Fixed Asset Purchase\" also unique.\n\n---\n\n**Are there fixed asset revaluations or write-downs/ups?**  \nNot found in provided data.\n\n---\n\n#### 8. **Interest Receivable—should we count it?**\nNo: It's a current asset, not a non-current (fixed) asset.\n\n#### 9. **Does the sample include unpaid purchases?**\nYes: \"unpaid\" purchases still add to assets (so included above).\n\n#### 10. **CONCLUSION**\n\n**Final answer:**  \n- Initial Non-current Assets:   8,000,000.00  \n- Ending Non-current Assets:  17,208,400.59\n\nBut let's check the line above: the sum for \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": is **17,208,400.59**\n\n---\n\n##### However, the sample said to show to 2 decimals in quotes.\nSo, rounding to two decimals:\n\n**Total Non-current Assets Initial Value:** \"8000000.00\"  \n**Total Non-current Assets End Value:**    \"17208400.59\"\n\n---\n\nTherefore, final result:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"17208400.59\"}}\n```\n\n#### 11. **Double Check Step**\n- Purchases: 17 entries, all for heavy equipment and asset purchases matching non-current asset additions.\n- Asset sales: all \"Sale\" lines for equipment, using \"cost_amount\" field (i.e., reduces non-current by the *book value*).\n- Depreciation: sum subtracts total depreciation for period.\n- Only initial and these changes included.\n\n---\n\n#### 12. **Matching the calculation above:**\n\n8,000,000.00 (initial)  \n+25,729,032.26 (all asset purchases/capex)  \n= 33,729,032.26  \n-16,400,000.00 (asset sales, book/Cost Amount)  \n=17,329,032.26  \n-120,631.67 (total depreciation)  \n=17,208,400.59\n\n---\n\n### **Final Output (instructed format)**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"17208400.59\"}}\n```",
