Identify Relevant Transactions for Fixed Assets\n\n#### Initial Fixed Assets\n- Find the initial fixed assets from the balance sheet opening (type: \"Fixed Assets\").\n  - | Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | ... | amount = 8000000.0\n\n#### Additions to Fixed Assets\n- Only transactions that represent actual fixed asset purchases should increase the value.\n- Look for:\n    - Type: \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" (such as \"FixedAsset20231231001\")\n    - Purchases of **fixed asset products** (as signaled by names like \"Heavy Equipment\", \"Heavy Machinery\", \"Industrial Facilities\", etc.), **NOT** inventory or general purchases.\n\n#### Sales/Disposals of Fixed Assets\n- If the company sells a fixed asset, it should be deducted from the closing value.\n- In this data, sales (type: \"Sale\") refer to \"Heavy Equipment A/B/C/D\" products that are likely fixed assets, so their cost must be removed.\n- Use the sale transaction's \"cost_amount\" field to deduct the carrying cost.\n\n#### Depreciation\n- Deduct any \"Depreciation\" transactions in the period.\n- There are two depreciation rows:\n    - 2024-01-01: amount = 45747.0\n    - 2024-02-01: amount = 74884.67\n\n### 2. Tabulate Purchases of Fixed Assets\n\nList all **purchases** of fixed assets (see purchases of \"Heavy Equipment A/B/C/D\" etc.):\n- Purchase20231231001: 2000000.0 (Heavy Equipment C)\n- Purchase20231231002: 1500000.0 (Heavy Equipment D)\n- Purchase20231231003: 1600000.0 (Heavy Equipment B)\n- Purchase20231231004: 500000.0  (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Purchase20231231005: 1000000.0 (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Purchase20231231006: 1500000.0 (Heavy Equipment D)\n- Purchase20231231007: 1000000.0 (Heavy Equipment C) [unpaid at initial, assume capitalized]\n- Purchase20231231008: 1000000.0 (Heavy Equipment C)\n- Purchase20231231009: 1000000.0 (Heavy Equipment C)\n- Purchase20231231010: 800000.0  (Heavy Equipment B)\n- Purchase20231231011: 1600000.0 (Heavy Equipment B)\n- Purchase20231231012: 500000.0  (Heavy Equipment A)\n- Purchase20231231013: 1000000.0 (Heavy Equipment A) [unpaid, assume capitalized]\n- Purchase20231231014: 2000000.0 (Heavy Equipment C)\n- Purchase20231231015: 1500000.0 (Heavy Equipment D)\n- Purchase20231231016: 1500000.0 (Heavy Equipment D)\n- Purchase20231231017: 3000000.0 (Heavy Equipment D)\n- Add: \n  - FixedAsset20231231001: 1219968.64 (Heavy Machinery4)\n  - FixedAsset20231231001: 1509063.62 (Industrial Facilities5)\n\n#### Summing all above:\n- Total Fixed Asset Purchases:\n\nCalculate:\n\n| Transaction              | Amount     |\n|--------------------------|------------|\n| Initial fixed assets     |  8,000,000 |\n| Purchase20231231001      |  2,000,000 |\n| Purchase20231231002      |  1,500,000 |\n| Purchase20231231003      |  1,600,000 |\n| Purchase20231231004      |    500,000 |\n| Purchase20231231005      |  1,000,000 |\n| Purchase20231231006      |  1,500,000 |\n| Purchase20231231007      |  1,000,000 |\n| Purchase20231231008      |  1,000,000 |\n| Purchase20231231009      |  1,000,000 |\n| Purchase20231231010      |    800,000 |\n| Purchase20231231011      |  1,600,000 |\n| Purchase20231231012      |    500,000 |\n| Purchase20231231013      |  1,000,000 |\n| Purchase20231231014      |  2,000,000 |\n| Purchase20231231015      |  1,500,000 |\n| Purchase20231231016      |  1,500,000 |\n| Purchase20231231017      |  3,000,000 |\n| FixedAsset20231231001    |  1,219,968.64 |\n| FixedAsset20231231001    |  1,509,063.62 |\n|--------------------------|------------|\n\nNow sum all these up.\n\nCombine **purchases** section:\n- Purchases sum:\n  \n2000000 + 1500000 + 1600000 + \n500000 + 1000000 + 1500000 + 1000000 + 1000000 + 1000000 + 800000 + 1600000 + 500000 + 1000000 + \n2000000 + 1500000 + 1500000 + 3000000 = \n\nLet's add stepwise to avoid errors:\n- 2000000 + 1500000 = 3500000\n- 3500000 + 1600000 = 5100000\n- 5100000 + 500000 = 5600000\n- 5600000 + 1000000 = 6600000\n- 6600000 + 1500000 = 8100000\n- 8100000 + 1000000 = 9100000\n- 9100000 + 1000000 = 10100000\n- 10100000 + 1000000 = 11100000\n- 11100000 + 800000 = 11900000\n- 11900000 + 1600000 = 13500000\n- 13500000 + 500000 = 14000000\n- 14000000 + 1000000 = 15000000\n- 15000000 + 2000000 = 17000000\n- 17000000 + 1500000 = 18500000\n- 18500000 + 1500000 = 20000000\n- 20000000 + 3000000 = 23000000\n\nSo purchases via \"Purchase...\" lines is 23,000,000\n\nNow add:\n- FixedAsset20231231001: 1,219,968.64\n- FixedAsset20231231001: 1,509,063.62\n\nTotal additions: \n23,000,000 + 1,219,968.64 + 1,509,063.62 = 25,729,032.26\n\nSo, total after additions:\nInitial value: 8,000,000\n+ purchases/additions: 25,729,032.26\n\nSubtotal: 8,000,000 + 25,729,032.26 = 33,729,032.26\n\n### 3.

Depreciation\n\nSum the depreciation rows:\n- 2024-01-01: 45,747.0\n- 2024-02-01: 74,884.67\n\nTotal depreciation: 45,747.0 + 74,884.67 = 120,631.67\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\n\nFixed Assets Ending Balance:\n\nStarting:    8,000,000.00  \n+ Additions:25,729,032.26  \n- Sales:    16,400,000.00  \n- Depreciation: 120,631.67\n\nCalculate:\n\n8,000,000.00 + 25,729,032.26 = 33,729,032.26  \n33,729,032.26 - 16,400,000.00 = 17,329,032.26  \n17,329,032.26 - 120,631.67 = 17,208,400.59\n\nHowever, please note: many \"Purchase\" lines are double-counting (e.g., each unit of Heavy Equipment, so did they get capitalized as a group?).\n\nBut upon retrying: Check if this matches expected logic and matches example.\n\nBut in your example with similar structure, **only the \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" and the initial balance counted, not every \"Purchase\" line**.\n\n### Therefore:\n- *Only count:*\n  - \"Initial\" balance for fixed assets: 8,000,000.00\n  - All direct \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" lines (not \"Purchase\" lines), e.g.:\n    - FixedAsset20231231001: 1,219,968.64\n    - FixedAsset20231231001: 1,509,063.62\n- Subtract: All sale \"cost_amount\" values for fixed assets SOLD\n- Subtract: All \"Depreciation\" in period\n\n#### Let's recalculate with *this* logic:\n\n- Initial: 8,000,000\n- + 1,219,968.64 (Heavy Machinery4)\n- + 1,509,063.62 (Industrial Facilities5)\n- = 10,729,032.26\n\n- - All \"cost_amount\" for sold assets (add up all cost_amounts as above): 16,400,000\n  - Oh, wait, but with only these two purchases, that can't be. \n\nBut in your **EXAMPLE**, \"Fixed Assets End Value\" = Initial + all \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" (not all other purchases) - Depreciation.\n\nSo in **your example**, asset sales do Not reduce carrying value unless the sales were of actual fixed assets purchased directly as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\". However, in classic accounting, all capitalized asset acquisitions that are not for resale should be included.\n\nGiven the nature of all these \"Heavy Equipment\" purchases (and the huge initial inventory), in your example, purchases such as \"Chemical Product A\" were NOT included, but a \"Storage Facility\" purchase (as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" type) was included.\n\nThus, given the data and your example: **Only sum the Initial, any 'Fixed Assets Purchase', then subtract depreciation. Do NOT sum the purchases of goods as fixed assets**.\n\n#### In that case, answer is:\n\n- Initial: 8,000,000.00\n- Additions:\n  - FixedAsset20231231001: 1,219,968.64\n  - FixedAsset20231231001: 1,509,063.62\n- = 10,729,032.26\n\n- Subtract depreciation:\n  - 45,747.0 + 74,884.67 = 120,631.67\n\nFinal value:\n10,729,032.26 - 120,631.67 = **10,608,400.59**\n\n### Confirm: **Does this match your example approach?**  \nYes, it does; do not include \"Purchase\" lines unless type is \"Fixed Assets Purchase\".\n\n## Final JSON Output:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"10608400.59\"}}\n```\n\n**(If you want to include fixed asset disposals, net book value removed upon disposal, you could reduce by cost_amount of sold \"Fixed Assets,\" but your example did NOT do so. Therefore, the answer above matches your format and logic.)**",
