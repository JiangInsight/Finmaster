                        "content": "Let's reason step by step:\n\n## 1. Accounts Receivable Initial Value\n\nLook for any initial balance :\n\n- From the initial data, we only have initial Cash deposit, Bank deposit, and Fixed Assets. **No initial accounts receivable** is stated.\n\n**Accounts Receivable Initial Value = 0.00**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Calculate the Accounts Receivable End Value\n\nAccounts receivable is increased by:\n- Sales recorded as \"Unpaid\" or with \"Account Receivable\" as receive_method/payment_status.\n\nIt is decreased by:\n- Customer payments (no indication of payment received for specific AR in this dataset; unless there's a \"Paid\" sales indicating a previously unpaid invoice, but in this data \"Paid\" sales all directly give cash/bank income, not AR deduction. So, AR grows only by new unpaid sales here.)\n\n### So: Add up all sales with \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Receviable\" in payment/receipt_status or receive_method. **Do not double count.**\n\nFind all Sales entries with (payment/receipt_status == \"Unpaid\") or (receive_method == \"Account Receviable\" or \"Account Receivable\").\n\nLet’s extract all relevant sales and sum the 'amount' columns.\n\n---\n\n#### From the data:\nFind all lines (the table is in markdown, but for clarity let’s \"visually scan\" for all sales with \"Unpaid\"/Account Receivable).\n\nI will list all such sales entry and their amounts:\n\n| id             | type  | amount       | payment/receipt_status | receive_method         |\n|----------------|-------|--------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Sale20240103002| Sale  | 1,302,111.59 | Unpaid                 | Account Receviable     |\n| Sale20240108007| Sale  | 1,460,946.33 | Unpaid                 | Account Receviable     |\n| Sale20240109009| Sale  | 1,489,365.79 | Unpaid                 | Account Receviable     |\n| Sale20240115014| Sale  | 674,738.01   | Unpaid                 | Account Receviable     |\n| Sale20240117018| Sale  | 1,124,652.91 | Unpaid                 | Account Receviable     |\n| Sale20240118019| Sale  | 1,166,055.78 | Unpaid                 | Account Receviable     |\n| Sale20240119021| Sale  | 1,150,635.95 | Unpaid                 | Account Receviable     |\n| Sale20240122024| Sale  | 1,499,323.77 | Unpaid                 | Account Receviable     |\n| Sale20240202036| Sale  | 2,063,873.27 | Unpaid                 | Account Receviable     |\n| Sale20240204039| Sale  | 2,002,579.13 | Unpaid                 | Account Receviable     |\n| Sale20240205041| Sale  | 1,428,329.11 | Unpaid                 | Account Receviable     |\n\n**Total entries: 11**\n\nLet's sum these amounts:\n\n1. 1,302,111.59\n2. 1,460,946.33\n3. 1,489,365.79\n4.   674,738.01\n5. 1,124,652.91\n6. 1,166,055.78\n7. 1,150,635.95\n8. 1,499,323.77\n9. 2,063,873.27\n10.2,002,579.13\n11.1,428,329.11\n\nLet's calculate the total step by step:\n\n- 1,302,111.59 + 1,460,946.33 = 2,763,057.92  \n- +1,489,365.79 = 4,252,423.71  \n- +674,738.01 = 4,927,161.72  \n- +1,124,652.91 = 6,051,814.63  \n- +1,166,055.78 = 7,217,870.41  \n- +1,150,635.95 = 8,368,506.36  \n- +1,499,323.77 = 9,867,830.13  \n- +2,063,873.27 = 11,931,703.4  \n- +2,002,579.13 = 13,934,282.53  \n- +1,428,329.11 = 15,362,611.64  \n\n**Total: 15,362,611.64**\n\n\n#### But let's double check against the data:\nAre there sales records missing here? Let's scan further:\n\nIs there any other sales lines with \"Unpaid\" or similar in payment status/receive_method?\n\nMaybe:\n- Sale20240122024: 1,499,323.77 (Already included)\n- Sale20240204039: 2,002,579.13 (Already included)\n- Sale20240202036: 2,063,873.27 (Already included)\n- **All other sales are \"Paid\" or \"Cash\" receive_method, so not included in receivables.**\n\n#### Are partial payments or payments on receivables shown?\nNo, there are no explicit customer payments that decrease AR in this data. All \"Paid\" sales are cash/bank receipts, not previously booked AR settlements.\n\n---\n\n## **Result**\n\n### Initial Value: 0.00\n### End Value: 15,362,611.64\n\n---\n\n## JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"15362611.64\"} }\n```\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"15362611.64\"} }\n```",
