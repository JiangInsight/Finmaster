Only purchases that are capitalized as fixed assets are included.\n\n2. **Look for Relevant Transaction Rows:**  \n   We look for transactions that are:\n   - Labeled as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" (very clear)\n   - Labeled as \"Purchase\", but with products that clearly are capital items (e.g., \"Heavy Equipment\", \"Machinery\", \"Industrial Facilities\", etc.), provided these are not inventory for resale but capital items for company use.  \n   However, since all \"Purchase\" lines here are for various 'Heavy Equipment' or similar, we need context whether these are for resale (i.e., company is a dealer) or for own use. Given the context and the presence of both \"Sale\" and \"Purchase\" of the same product, it's highly probable these are for stock/inventory (for sale, not for use as fixed assets).\n\n   **BUT**, lines labeled as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" (shown below) are definitely for fixed assets:\n   - | FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 1219968.64\n   - | FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 1509063.62\n\n   These lines have descriptions like \"Heavy Machinery4\" and \"Industrial Facilities5\" under \"asset_name\" and \"asset_type\", respectively, which further confirms they're fixed assets.\n\n3. **Sum Cash Paid for Fixed Asset Purchases:**  \n   Only these \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" entries should be included:\n\n   | id                     | type                   | date       | amount      | asset_name         | asset_type             |\n   |------------------------|------------------------|------------|-------------|--------------------|------------------------|\n   | FixedAsset20231231001  | Fixed Assets Purchase  |2023-12-31  |1219968.64   | Heavy Machinery4   | Heavy Machinery        |\n   | FixedAsset20231231001  | Fixed Assets Purchase  |2023-12-31  |1509063.62   | Industrial Facilities5 | Industrial Facilities |\n\n   Sum:\n   - 1219968.64 + 1509063.62 = **2,729,032.26**\n\n**Thus, the purchase of fixed assets for the cash flow statement is:**\n\n**2,729,032.26**",
