Let's check each.\n\n#### From above, in each case usually 1 per day. But on 25th, there appear to be two such transfer lines (Maybe duplication?).\n\n| Date           | Occurrences     |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| 2024-01-22     | 1              | Transfer20240122001 (cash to bank)  \n| 2024-01-23     | 1              | Transfer20240123001 (cash to bank)\n| 2024-01-24     | 1              | Transfer20240124001 (cash to bank)\n| 2024-01-25     | 2              | Transfer20240125001 (two: both cash to bank, then some bank to cash)\n| 2024-01-26     | 1              | Transfer20240126001\n| 2024-01-27     | 2              | Transfer20240127001 (two listed \"cash to bank\")\n| 2024-01-28     | 1              | Transfer20240128001\n| 2024-01-29     | 1              | Transfer20240129001\n\nNote: For dates with multiple \"cash to bank\" on same date/id, only count once (most likely). But let's double check by ids:\n\n- On 25th: Both \"Transfer20240125001\", but one is cash-to-bank, one is bank-to-cash, both for 1,000,000. On 27th, both are listed as \"cash-to-bank\" (double entry?), on closer look, there is always a pair: cash-to-bank and bank-to-cash.\n\nSo let's check for each transfer id (row, not counting same id twice):\n\nFor Jan 23:  \nTransfer20240123001: (1,000,000) cash-to-bank  \nTransfer20240123001: (1,000,000) bank-to-cash  \n\nSo for each id, is there both cash-to-bank and bank-to-cash? YES\n\nThis suggests that on any given date with a bank-to-cash and a cash-to-bank of equal amount, their net effect is zero. Let's therefore ignore such offsetting pairs.\n\nLooking through the list, **every transfer X appears as BOTH cash to bank AND bank to cash of the same amount** (i.e., X once as 'cash to bank', once as 'bank to cash').\n\nThus, the **net amount of bank-related transfers is zero**.\n\n---\n\n### **2.4 Purchases Paid By Cash: Exclude These**\n\nPurchases paid by cash (per type/payment_method column) do not affect bank deposits.\n\n---\n\n### **2.5 Sales: Look for Sales with Bank Receipt**\n\nAll sales are either unpaid or 'cash' (see 'receive_method'). None mentions receipt to bank or 'Paid' with bank.\n\nHence, **no direct bank inflow from sales**.\n\n---\n\n### **2.6 Expenses: Any Paid by Bank?**\n\nMost expenses show paid by cash. So, **no effect on bank**, skip.\n\n---\n\n### **2.7 Summary of Affecting Transactions**\n\nSo, for bank deposits we need:  \n**Start + Transfers In - Purchases via Bank - Fixed Asset Purchases via Bank**  \n\nBut we saw **transfers net to 0** (because on each, same amount leaves bank to cash and returns), so they do not affect ending balance.\n\n**Therefore, only initial balance minus all bank outflows counts.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate Final Bank Deposit**\n\nLet:\n- **Initial Bank Deposit:** 15,000,000.00  \n- **(-) Purchases via Bank:** 15,400,000.00  \n- **(-) Fixed Assets Purchases via Bank:** 2,729,032.26  \n\n**Calculation:**  \n15,000,000.00  \n− 15,400,000.00  \n− 2,729,032.26  \n= 15,000,000.00 − 18,129,032.26  \n= **−3,129,032.26**  \n\nThis would be negative, which cannot be. Let's check the problem.\n\nBut, **initial cash deposit** is also present:  \n| Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5,000,000.00 |\n\nBut this is for \"Cash\" asset, not \"Bank\".\n\nDouble-checking the **samples in the instructions**: the initial bank deposit comes from the row specifying | type | Bank deposit | only.\n\nTherefore, initial bank deposit (opening) = **15,000,000.00**\n\nAll purchases/expenses paid by \"Bank Transfer\" or for fixed assets paid by bank, **subtract**.\n\nAll \"Transfers\" net zero (because for every cash-to-bank, there is a bank-to-cash on same date/id and amount).\n\nNo sales or other inflows to bank.\n\n---\n\n#### CONFIRM BY CALC AGAIN\n\n- **Initial bank deposits:**     15,000,000.00  \n- **Total out via purchases:**  15,400,000.00  \n- **Total out via fixed assets:**2,729,032.26  \n------------------------------------------\n**Total used:** 15,400,000.00 + 2,729,032.26 = 18,129,032.26  \n\n\n**Ending balance: 15,000,000.00 − 18,129,032.26 = −3,129,032.26**  \n\nBut a negative bank balance is highly unlikely; this suggests either a missing inflow or a problem in interpretation.\n\nWait: are all the \"purchases via bank transfer\" really all from bank? Or is this the **combined bank payments for all purchases**, and only the portion paid by bank should be considered.\n\nLet's use the 'cost_per_unit' or payment breakdown:\n\nLooking at the examples: see e.g.  \nPurchase20231231001 | ... | 2,000,000.0 | ... | Paid | Bank Transfer | 1,000,000.0 | ...  \n- Cost_per_unit = 1,000,000.0, quantity 2.0, unit price 1,000,000.0  \n- Payment_method: Bank Transfer (**but no split between payment methods**).\n\nBut in our sample, in some other problems, the actual outflow is 'amount' (total), not per unit, and the payment method reflects the method for the full amount.\n\nSo we take the **amount** for every \"Paid\" \"Bank Transfer\" \"Purchase\" as an outflow.\n\nSame approach for fixed assets.\n\nNo acquisitions via bank transfer for expenses (all 'cash').\n\nAll cash-to-bank transfers net zero.\n\n**No sales into bank.**\n\n#### Cross-check: Are there any \"Paid\" bank transfer on SALES? (i.e., money in via bank, not just cash, to the company?)  \nNO — all sales marked 'unpaid' or 'cash' receive_method.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Calculation**\n\n**Bank Deposits Initial Value:** 15,000,000.00\n\n**All Outflows, total:**  \n- Purchases by bank:         15,400,000.00  \n- Fixed assets via bank:      2,729,032.26  \n----------------------------------------\n=                               18,129,032.26\n\nSo,\n\n**Bank Deposits End Value:**  \n15,000,000.00 - 18,129,032.26 = **-3,129,032.26**\n\nBut a negative makes no sense. Let's doublecheck transfer lines.\n\nLooking at the sample, in the worked sample, cash-to-bank and bank-to-cash both appear, but the sample only counts net effect.\n\nIn this problem, are there *any* inflows to bank other than opening deposit? No.  \nAre there *any* \"Receipt\" via bank? No.\n\nAre the \"cash-to-bank transfer\" and \"bank-to-cash transfer\" both pairs, always same amount, same day? Let's detail per date and id:\n\n- For Transfer20240123001 (2024-01-23): both Cash-to-bank and Bank-to-cash 1,000,000 each.\n\n=> So for every transfer, the *net effect is 0*.\n\n**Thus, the ONLY changes to bank are:**\n- Start with opening;\n- Subtract bank purchases and fixed asset paid by bank.\n\nHence, if outflows > opening, the ending balance is negative, which is an overdrawn account.\n\n---\n\nBased on above, unless there is an error in the data, or unless the expectation is to let the bank account be negative if outflows exceed opening, then that is the result.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"15000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"-3129032.26\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\nIf you expect that the bank cannot go negative and 'excess' is paid by cash, then perhaps you want to only account for outflows up to 15,000,000. But the instructions and pattern in the sample suggest sticking to the math above.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"15000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"-3129032.26\"}}\n```",
