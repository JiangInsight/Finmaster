Cash on hand\n2. Bank deposit\n3. Accounts Receivable (open, unpaid sales)\n4. Interest Receivable (open, unpaid interest)\n\n#### 1. Cash/Bank Movements\n\n- All \"Cash to bank\", \"Bank to cash\" transfers **do not change** total current assets, only the distribution.\n- So their sum is always Bank+Cash, which is originally 20,000,000.\n\nBut we must include all **cash and bank payments** (purchases, expenses, etc. OUTflows) and **receipts** (from sales paid in cash/bank), to see how much remains.\n\nLet’s keep a running total:\n\n#### **Start:**\n- Cash: 5,000,000\n- Bank: 15,000,000\n- Total: 20,000,000\n\n#### **Payments OUT of cash/bank:**\n- Purchases (Paid): These are for equipment → count as fixed assets (NOT reduce current assets → assets just reclassified), so we do not subtract from total current assets (the nature of the transaction matters).\n- Expenses: Outflows from cash/bank, reduce current assets unless they increase another current asset.\n- Only \"Unpaid\" purchases (Accounts Payable) would temporarily not leave cash yet.\n\n#### **Receipts INTO current assets:**\n- Sales (Account Receivable): Do NOT increase cash until paid, but increase A/R.\n- Sales (Paid): Increase cash/bank when received.\n- Interest Receivable: Increase I/R asset.\n\n#### **We should:**\n- Start from initial\n- Subtract all cash outflows (expenses, only those paid not on credit) \n- Subtract amounts paid for fixed assets (since cash is exchanged for noncurrent asset)\n- Add sales paid in cash/bank to replenish cash\n- For sales \"Account Receivable\", add to A/R balance\n- For \"Interest Receivable\", add to IR balance\n\n\n#### **Let’s Track: Major Types**\n\n##### A. **Cash & Bank Balance**: Initial 20,000,000\n\n- Subtract all cash/bank outflows\n    - Purchases (if paid): money moves from bank/cash to fixed asset. For *current asset total*, there is NO net change (cash out, but fixed asset in—a noncurrent asset, but current decreases). So at the END, we only care what is left in cash/bank and other CURRENT asset lines.\n    - Expenses: paid expenses decrease cash/bank, unless they create a current asset (e.g. prepaid), but here these appear as normal expenses.\n    - Sales (Paid): inflow to cash/bank\n    - Transfers between cash/bank: net to zero\n\nIn reality, the quickest approach is to:\n- Take the initial cash+bank (20,000,000)\n- Subtract all cash and bank outflows (purchases and expenses paid from cash, NOT unpaid purchases)\n- Add all cash/bank INflows (sales marked as paid)\n- Ignore transfers (just shifts between cash + bank)\n\n##### B. **Accounts Receivable**:\n\nSum all sales not paid (i.e., \"Account Receivable\", \"Unpaid\") and not yet paid by period-end.\n\n##### C. **Interest Receivable**:\n\nSum all \"Interest Receivable\" balances.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Work the numbers\n\nLet's list components:\n\n#### A. **Accounts Receivable (open at period end)**\nSum all sales with \"**Unpaid**\" or \"Account Receivable\" (not paid), i.e. those that increase A/R.\n\nFrom the entries:\n\n- Sale20240103002: 1,302,111.59 (Account Receivable)\n- Sale20240108007: 1,460,946.33 (A/R)\n- Sale20240109009: 1,489,365.79 (A/R)\n- Sale20240115014:   674,738.01 (A/R)\n- Sale20240117018: 1,124,652.91 (A/R)\n- Sale20240118019: 1,166,055.78 (A/R)\n- Sale20240119021: 1,150,635.95 (A/R)\n- Sale20240122024: 1,499,323.77 (A/R)\n- Sale20240202036: 2,063,873.27 (A/R)\n- Sale20240204039: 2,002,579.13 (A/R)\n- Sale20240205041: 1,428,329.11 (A/R)\n\n(*We assume all earlier \"Account Receivable\" sales are still unpaid, as no payment received lines provided and no other info that payment is collected*)\n\nSum:\nAdd all these:\n\n1,302,111.59  \n+1,460,946.33  \n+1,489,365.79  \n+  674,738.01  \n+1,124,652.91  \n+1,166,055.78  \n+1,150,635.95  \n+1,499,323.77  \n+2,063,873.27  \n+2,002,579.13  \n+1,428,329.11  \n= **15,362,611.64**\n\n#### B. **Interest Receivable**\n\nAdd up all interest receivable entries (they are all \"Unpaid\"):\n\nList all \"Interest Receivables\":\n(First: positive only.

It's not possible; likely, not all these purchases are paid from cash/bank; must check \"Paid\" status.\n\nChecking explicit in the data, let's count only \"Paid\" ones, skipping those with \"Unpaid\".\n\nFrom the transaction sample:\n- Purchase20231231001 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231002 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231003 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231004 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231005 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231006 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231008 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231009 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231010 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231011 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231012 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231014 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231015 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231016 (Paid)\n- Purchase20231231017 (Paid)\n\nThat's the correct subset.\n\nSum those:\n\nFrom above:\n1. 2,000,000.0\n2. 1,500,000.0 = 3,500,000.0\n3. 1,600,000.0 = 5,100,000.0\n4.   500,000.0 = 5,600,000.0\n5. 1,000,000.0 = 6,600,000.0\n6. 1,500,000.0 = 8,100,000.0\n7. 1,000,000.0 = 9,100,000.0\n8. 1,000,000.0 = 10,100,000.0\n9. 1,600,000.0 = 11,700,000.0\n10.  800,000.0 = 12,500,000.0\n11.  500,000.0 = 13,000,000.0\n12. 1,000,000.0 = 14,000,000.0\n13. 1,500,000.0 = 15,500,000.0\n14. 1,500,000.0 = 17,000,000.0\n15. 1,000,000.0 = 18,000,000.0\n16. 1,500,000.0 = 19,500,000.0\n17. 3,000,000.0 = 22,500,000.0\n\nSo total **Paid Purchases** = 22,500,000.0\n\nPlus, fixed assets purchases:\n- 1,219,968.64 (2023-12-31: FixedAsset): 23,719,968.64\n- 1,509,063.62 (2023-12-31: FixedAsset): 25,229,032.26\n\n**Total outflow (cash for purchases and fixed assets, i.e., on PAID items)**: 25,229,032.26  \n\nTherefore, **all initial cash+bank** outflows for purchases/fixed assets, if purchased from current asset cash/bank.\n\nBut initial current assets was 20,000,000. Something off: Not all purchases can be paid instantly, or there is a misclassification.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"purchases\" are all for fixed assets, i.e., the company is buying equipment, and the cash converted into fixed assets, so at period end, \"cash\" is reduced by exactly the paid amounts for fixed assets. The remaining cash is wiped out, and all that’s left are unpaid receivables (A/R, I/R) plus any cash received from sales.\n\nBut we also need to **add cash collected from paid sales:** since those replenish cash/bank balance.\n\nLet’s process total movement:\n\nInitial balance: 20,000,000\n\nMINUS all \"Paid\" purchases and fixed asset acquisitions (as above):  \nTotal = 25,229,032.26\n\nInitial balance is insufficient; so it's likely (from the \"paid\" tag) that these expenses and purchases are paid as cash becomes available, i.e., from current asset \"cash\", but as sales are made and paid, they replenish the cash/bank balance.\n\nSo, let's get all **sales paid**, and add that to cash:\n\nSales (Paid), i.e., receipts following \"Paid\" sales (not \"Account Receivable\"), add those as cash in, thus replenish the cash/bank.\n\nFind all \"Sale\" entries marked \"Paid\", with an amount:\n\nFind these:\n\n- Sale20240116016: Sale, Paid, amount: 651,423.21\n- Sale20240120023: Sale, Paid, amount: 659,057.20\n- Sale20240123026: Sale, Paid, amount: 710,732.40\n- Sale20240125027: Sale, Paid, amount: 2,008,346.63\n- Sale20240128030: Sale, Paid, amount: 2,099,974.04\n- Sale20240130032: Sale, Paid, amount: 1,384,532.44\n\nSum those:\n651,423.21  \n+659,057.20 = 1,310,480.41  \n+710,732.40 = 2,021,212.81  \n+2,008,346.63 = 4,029,559.44  \n+2,099,974.04 = 6,129,533.48  \n+1,384,532.44 = 7,514,065.92\n\nSo, total cash/bank inflow from sales = **7,514,065.92**\n\nTherefore, the **ending cash/bank balance** is:  \n= Initial cash/bank  \n– all paid purchases & fixed assets  \n– all paid expenses  \n+ cash received from paid sales\n\nSo plug in:\n\nInitial cash/bank: 20,000,000  \n– paid purchases & fixed assets: 25,229,032.26  \n– paid expenses: 2,863,395.59  \n+ cash inflow from sales: 7,514,065.92\n\nSo\n\n20,000,000  \n– 25,229,032.26 = –5,229,032.26  \n– 2,863,395.59   = –8,092,427.85  \n+ 7,514,065.92   = –578,361.93\n\nSo the **ending cash/bank** is actually negative, which cannot happen.\n\nWhat does this mean? It suggests that the purchases and expenses outflow the cash/bank more than it received, but in reality, the company would not overdraw cash—it cannot pay more than it has. Possibly not all \"paid\" purchases are actually paid within the period, or there are errors in the tags (e.g., some purchases might be on credit but labeled \"Paid\"), or perhaps only part payment was made. Alternatively, perhaps the cash-in from A/R collected is missed.\n\nAlternatively, the sum paid for expenses and purchases should only be the reduction vs initial current assets; everything above that would be a liability.\n\nBut according to the earlier example, the answer is (in prior problem) initial 8M, ending about 7.9M, so the reductions are due to cash outflows.\n\nAlternatively, **maybe purchases are NOT current asset reductions, because they just shift assets (i.e., cash to fixed asset, so not counted as a deduction from \"total current assets\")**. So possibly, the only outgoing that reduces current assets is paid expenses (money gone), while money shifted to fixed asset is neither current nor differs in total assets.\n\nSo, perhaps, simpler and more in line with the example: **Total Current Assets at end = cash+bank left + A/R + I/R**\n\nSo to calculate **ending cash+bank**:\n\nInitial: 20,000,000  \n– all paid expenses: 2,863,395.59  \n– all paid purchases: (shifted to fixed: so, they are not current assets after purchase; incidentally, that’s why in the example above, the initial assets in aggregate, fixed and current, add up to a bigger number.)  \nBut the paid amount is removed from current assets; what's left is what remains.\n\nTherefore, after all, the formula:\n**Ending Current Assets = (remaining cash + bank) + A/R + I/R**  \n**Remaining cash+bank = initial cash+bank — (all paid expenses + all paid purchases/fixed assets) + all sales paid in cash/bank**\n\nSo let's check what would be left.\n\nFrom above:\n- Initial current assets: 20,000,000\n- Paid expenses + purchases/fixed assets: 25,229,032.26 + 2,863,395.59 = 28,092,427.85\n- Cash from paid sales: 7,514,065.92\n\nSo,\n20,000,000 + 7,514,065.92 = 27,514,065.92\n– 28,092,427.85 = **–578,361.93** (negative cash! Can't be.)\n\nBut perhaps, **sales paid in cash** are considered both in initial cash/bank and also in A/R, so we're double-counting if we add cash inflow from paid sales. Rather, when a sale is made and is paid in cash, money comes in, and cash/bank increases; if A/R, A/R increases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we're better off:\n\nAt period end, the **current assets are:**\n- whatever remains in cash/bank (after all, including only cash/bank-in/out and only counting non-fixed-asset flows)\n- plus balances of A/R (open, unpaid sales)\n- plus Interest Receivable (open, unpaid)\n\nAt this point, essentially, after paying all purchases and expenses, from initial cash/bank, and adding in any customer payments received, what is left as \"current assets\" is what's not paid out as a fixed asset (i.e., cash left).\n\nGiven this, and given the excess of paid purchases and expenses over initial current assets, the answer would in practice be **all open balances of A/R and I/R**, and perhaps the remainder is zero or negative for cash/bank.\n\nBut let's check **how many unpaid purchases** (i.e., purchases with status \"Unpaid\"), these would leave cash not decreased by that amount.\n\nLooking for entries:\n- Purchase20231231007: Purchase, Unpaid, 1,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231013: Purchase, Unpaid, 1,000,000.0\n\nSum unpaid purchases: 2,000,000.0\n\nPerhaps, only these two are still unpaid, i.e., cash did not go out for them.\n\nTherefore, total paid purchases is:  \n25,229,032.26 – 2,000,000.0 = **23,229,032.26**\n\nNow, recompute:\n\n- Initial cash+bank = 20,000,000  \n- Subtract paid expenses: 2,863,395.59  \n- Subtract paid purchases: 23,229,032.26  \n- Add paid sales inflow: 7,514,065.92  \n\nSo,\n20,000,000  \n+7,514,065.92 = 27,514,065.92  \n–2,863,395.59 = 24,650,670.33  \n–23,229,032.26 = 1,421,638.07\n\nSo, **remaining cash+bank = 1,421,638.07**\n\nNow, add **A/R**: 15,362,611.64  \nAnd **I/R**: 13,240.11\n\nHence, \nTotal Current Assets at end of period:  \n= remaining cash + A/R + I/R  \n= 1,421,638.07 + 15,362,611.64 + 13,240.11  \n= 16,797,489.82\n\nBut this is way above initial 20M (and yet we spent almost all). Let's check, are all purchases and expenses actually paid with cash, or are they netted/offset?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the proper method (based on the sample in the question):\n- Start with initial CA amount\n- Add: sales paid in cash\n- Subtract: paid expenses\n- Subtract: paid purchases (paid purchases; *but only those for inventory*, not fixed assets)\nIn the *example*, purchases with type \"Purchase\" are added to current assets (inventory), but in this dataset, all purchases are for capital equipment, i.e., fixed assets, and are thus current asset reductions (removing cash, replaced by noncurrent asset).\n\nTherefore, only cash+bank left + open A/R + open I/R = total current assets\n\nGiven most cash is out for paid purchases, what is left is:\n\nInitial cash+bank: 20,000,000  \nLess: **all paid purchases** (total of 25,229,032.26)  \nBut, two unpaid of 2M, so actually 23,229,032.26 paid  \nLess: all **paid expenses** (2,863,395.59)\n\nSo,\n20,000,000  \n–23,229,032.26 = –3,229,032.26  \n–2,863,395.59 = –6,092,427.85\n\nPlus: all paid sales: 7,514,065.92\n\nTotal: –6,092,427.85 + 7,514,065.92 = **1,421,638.07**  \n\nThis matches earlier.\n\nTotal cash+bank remaining: **1,421,638.07**\n\nThen, open A/R: **15,362,611.64**\nInterest Receivable: **13,240.11**\n\nTotal current assets: 1,421,638.07 + 15,362,611.64 + 13,240.11 = **16,797,489.82**\n\nGiven that, but compare to the initial of 20,000,000 (from cash and bank). The difference could be explained by the company expending cash for assets that become noncurrent (fixed assets, not included in current asset calculation); what is left is as above.\n\n### **Final Answers**\n\n- **Total Current Assets Initial Value**: 20,000,000.00 (cash + bank at start)\n- **Total Current Assets End Value**: 1,421,638.07 (cash & bank left) + 15,362,611.64 (A/R) + 13,240.11 (I/R) = **16,797,489.82**\n\n#### **Final presentation:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"20000000.00\", \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"16797489.82\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n#### **SANITY CHECK: Corresponds with actual cash flow—most cash converted into fixed assets, spent on expenses, rest stays as A/R and I/R.**\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Assets Initial Value\": \"20000000.00\", \"Total Current Assets End Value\": \"16797489.82\"} }\n```\n",
