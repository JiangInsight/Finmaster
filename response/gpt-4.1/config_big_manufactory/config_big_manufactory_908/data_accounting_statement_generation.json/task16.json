                        "content": "Let's proceed step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Understand what Paid-in Capital is.**  \nPaid-in Capital (Contributed Capital) is the amount of money that shareholders have invested in the company by purchasing shares directly from the company. It appears in the equity section of the balance sheet.  \n- **Paid-in capital is generally deposited at the company start, and any additional investments by shareholders are added, if any.**\n- It is not affected by company profits, losses, sales, purchases, expenses, etc.\n- It can increase only if shareholders inject new capital.  \n- It can decrease only in rare cases, such as capital reductions or distributions to shareholders (not present here).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Initial Paid-in Capital**  \nLook for the \"Initial...\" rows at the very top as the initial registered capital.\n\n| id                   | type           | date       | amount      |\n|----------------------|----------------|------------|-------------|\n| Initial20231231001   | Cash deposit   | 2023-12-31 | 5,000,000.0 |\n| Initial20231231001   | Bank deposit   | 2023-12-31 | 15,000,000.0|\n| Initial20231231001   | Fixed Assets   | 2023-12-31 | 8,000,000.0 |\n\nAll three are \"Initial...\" and have the **same id**. These represent the initial capital contributions, possibly with a breakdown: part cash, part bank, part contributed assets.  \n**Total Initial Paid-in Capital = 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 28,000,000**\n\n**Step 3: Look for any new capital increases (additional paid-in capital)**  \nScroll through the entire ledger:  \n- All other “Purchase”, “Sale”, “Expense”, “Depreciation”, “Interest Receivables”, “Transfer” and “Fixed Assets Purchase” records are ordinary business activity.\n- There are **NO further “Initial” or “Capital Increase” transaction types**.  \n- “Fixed Assets Purchase” is asset acquisition, not shareholder capital injection.\n- No line about shareholder withdrawals or capital reduction.\n\nTherefore,\n- **Paid-in Capital at Period End = Paid-in Capital at Period Start**\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Plug values in the required format**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\", \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"28000000.00\"} }\n```\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\", \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"28000000.00\"} }\n```",
