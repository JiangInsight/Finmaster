                        "content": "Let's complete the Accounts Payable (“应付账款”) calculation step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: **Initial Value on Balance Sheet Date (2023-12-31)**\n\nLook for the **initial balance** of Accounts Payable (if any) on 2023-12-31. In your data, the only initial lines are:\n- Cash deposit\n- Bank deposit\n- Fixed Assets\n\n**None of these relate to Accounts Payable**. So the **opening balance at 2023-12-31 is 0.00**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Find all purchase transactions influencing Accounts Payable**\n\nWe need to locate all “Purchase” entries and find those with **status**:  \n- Unpaid (i.e. \"Account Payable\")\n\nLet's scan the \"Purchase\" rows for \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Payable\":\n\n#### **Here are relevant rows:**\n\n| id                | type      | date       | amount   | payment/receipt_status | payment_method  | supplier_id | ... |\n|-------------------|-----------|------------|----------|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------|-----|\n| Purchase20231231007 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 1,000,000 | Unpaid                | Account Payable | S001        | ... |\n| Purchase20231231013 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 1,000,000 | Unpaid                | Account Payable | S006        | ... |\n\n- There are only **two rows** that have payment status \"Unpaid\" and payment method \"Account Payable\".\n\n#### **Confirm their status at period end (2024-02-05)**\n\nWe also need to check if any of these accounts payable were later paid during the period (reduce the end balance).  \n**Scan for payments to S001 or S006 that would clear these payables:**\n\nIn all Payment (“Paid”) occurrences, they’re either for new purchases, or not to S001/S006 for these particular amounts, or are cash/other suppliers. There are no cash or bank payments listed for S001 (1,000,000) or S006 (1,000,000) clearing these payables.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Sum up the unpaid amounts**\n\n- Purchase20231231007: 1,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231013: 1,000,000.00\n\n**Total = 2,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Final Value**\n\nThere are **no new unpaid purchases** after 2023-12-31 (all subsequent purchases are Paid).  \nThere are **no reductions** (payments) listed for these open payables (based on status and payment method).\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"2000000.00\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n**Explanation**:\n- No opening balance of Accounts Payable on 2023-12-31.\n- Only two unpaid purchase transactions (each 1,000,000), totaling 2,000,000, and they remain unpaid at period end—no evidence in the data of them being paid.\n- Thus, ending balance is 2,000,000.00.",
