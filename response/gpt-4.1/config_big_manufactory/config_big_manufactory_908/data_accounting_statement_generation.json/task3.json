Let's sum the number of units purchased and number sold by product for crosschecking.\n\n#### A. Purchases (by item):\n\n- Heavy Equipment A (P001):\n  - 1 (500k) + 2 (1M) + 1 (500k) + 2 (1M) = 6 units\n\n- Heavy Equipment B (P002):\n  - 2 (1.6M) + 1 (800k) + 2 (1.6M) = 5 units\n\n- Heavy Equipment C (P003):\n  - 2 (2M) + 1 (1M) + 1 (1M) + 1 (1M) + 1 (1M) + 2 (2M) = 8 units\n\n- Heavy Equipment D (P004):\n  - 1 (1.5M) + 1 (1.5M) + 1 (1.5M) + 2 (3M) + 1 (1.5M) + 1 (1.5M) = 7 units\n\n#### B. Sales (by item):\n- Heavy Equipment A (P001): 4 units sold\n- Heavy Equipment B (P002): 3 units sold\n- Heavy Equipment C (P003): 6 units sold\n- Heavy Equipment D (P004): 5 units sold\n\n**Therefore, ending unit counts (should match cost):**\n\n- P001: 6 purchased - 4 sold = 2 units left x 500,000 = 1,000,000\n- P002: 5 purchased - 3 sold = 2 units left x 800,000 = 1,600,000\n- P003: 8 purchased - 6 sold = 2 units left x 1,000,000 = 2,000,000\n- P004: 7 purchased - 5 sold = 2 units left x 1,500,000 = 3,000,000\n\nWait, but our cost calculation by sale assumes fixed cost per sale and the number of purchases seems to be more. Let's check the purchase side per product and make sure the calculation matches.\n\nLooking at purchases for each product and their unit prices:\n\n- **P001**  \n  Purchases: (1 x 500k) + (2 x 500k) + (1 x 500k) + (2 x 500k) = 1.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 + 2.0 = 6 units x 500k = 3,000,000\n\n- **P002**  \n  Purchases: (2 x 800k) + (1 x 800k) + (2 x 800k) = 2.0 + 1.0 + 2.0 = 5 units x 800k = 4,000,000\n\n- **P003**  \n  Purchases: (2 x 1M) + (1 x 1M) + (1 x 1M) + (1 x 1M) + (1 x 1M) + (2 x 1M) = 2+1+1+1+1+2=8 units x 1M = 8,000,000\n\n- **P004**  \n  Purchases: (1 x 1.5M) + (1 x 1.5M) + (1 x 1.5M) + (2 x 1.5M) + (1 x 1.5M) + (1 x 1.5M) = 1+1+1+2+1+1=7 units x 1.5M=10,500,000\n\nBut our purchase sum above was only 22,000,000. So let's add above values:\n\nP001: 3,000,000  \nP002: 4,000,000  \nP003: 8,000,000  \nP004: 10,500,000  \nTotal: 25,500,000\n\nWait, but in our sheet, some unit prices for P002 were 1.6M/2units, so maybe not always 800k/unit. Let's check all purchase rows and sum by product and value:\n\nGather purchases by product line-by-line for accuracy:\n\n- **P001**\n  - 1. 20231231004: 500,000 for 1 unit (unit price 500k)\n  - 2. 20231231005: 1,000,000 for 2 units (unit price 500k)\n  - 3. 20231231012: 500,000 for 1 unit (unit price 500k)\n  - 4. 20231231013: 1,000,000 for 2 units (unit price 500k)\n  - Total: 6 units, 3,000,000\n\n- **P002**\n  - 20231231003: 1,600,000 for 2 units (unit price 800k)\n  - 20231231010: 800,000 for 1 unit (800k)\n  - 20231231011: 1,600,000 for 2 units (800k)\n  - Total: 5 units, 4,000,000\n\n- **P003**\n  - 20231231001: 2,000,000 for 2 units (1,000,000 each)\n  - 20231231007: 1,000,000 for 1 unit (1M)\n  - 20231231008: 1,000,000 for 1 (1M)\n  - 20231231009: 1,000,000 for 1 (1M)\n  - 20231231014: 2,000,000 for 2 (1M)\n  - Total: 2+1+1+1+2 = 7 units, 7,000,000 (**not 8 as above** - possibly missing one, double check...)\n\nWait:  \n- 20231231001: 2 units  \n- 20231231007: 1 unit  \n- 20231231008: 1 unit  \n- 20231231009: 1 unit  \n- 20231231014: 2 units  \nTotal: 2+1+1+1+2 = 7 units\n\nBut also:  \n- 20231231014: Yes, 2 units  \nSo total purchases P003: **7 units, 7,000,000**\n\n- **P004**\n  - 20231231002: 1,500,000 for 1 unit (1.5M)\n  - 20231231006: 1,500,000 for 1 unit\n  - 20231231015: 1,500,000 for 1 unit\n  - 20231231016: 1,500,000 for 1 unit\n  - 20231231017: 3,000,000 for 2 units (1.5M)\n  - Total: 1+1+1+1+2=6 units, 9,000,000\n\n**Now correct totals:**\nP001: 6 units, 3,000,000  \nP002: 5 units, 4,000,000  \nP003: 7 units, 7,000,000  \nP004: 6 units, 9,000,000  \nSum: 3M+4M+7M+9M=23,000,000\n\nBut in our previous sum, the total was 22,000,000, so maybe 1M missing due to omission or misclassification.\n\nNow let's check for purchases list:\n(From sheet in step 2, if we tally up all amounts):\n\n2,000,000 (31001)  \n1,500,000 (31002)  \n1,600,000 (31003)  \n  500,000 (31004)  \n1,000,000 (31005)  \n1,500,000 (31006)  \n1,000,000 (31007)  \n1,000,000 (31008)  \n1,000,000 (31009)  \n  800,000 (31010)  \n1,600,000 (31011)  \n  500,000 (31012)  \n1,000,000 (31013)  \n2,000,000 (31014)  \n1,500,000 (31015)  \n1,500,000 (31016)  \n3,000,000 (31017)  \n**Total: 22,500,000**\n\nNow, with corrected units per product as per details above.

Let's reconfirm each:\n\nP001: Sold 4 x 500k = 2M  \nP002: 3 x 800k = 2.4M  \nP003: 6 x 1M = 6M  \nP004: 4 x 1.5M = 6M  \nSum: 2 + 2.4 + 6 + 6 = 16.4M\n\nNow,  \nEnding inventory = 22,500,000 - 16,400,000 = 6,100,000\n\nBut as above, totals of units on hand, valued at historical purchase cost, sum to 1M + 1.6M + 1M + 3M = **6,600,000**.\n\n**Thus, the correct closing inventory is 6,600,000.**\n\n---\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"Inventory End Value\": \"6600000.00\"\n  }\n}\n```",
