What is \"Paid-in Capital\"?\nPaid-in Capital (also called Contributed Capital) generally represents amounts invested in the company by its owners/shareholders. This typically comes from initial issuance of shares and sometimes from additional injections made by owners, but NOT from profits or normal business operations.\n\nIn business bookkeeping, initial \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", and direct investments into \"Fixed Assets\" at company setup are examples of paid-in capital.\n\nSubsequent purchases, expenses, sales, or transfers between cash and bank, do **not** change the paid-in capital (unless there is a documented, explicit capital increase or decrease by owner/shareholder decision, which would be reflected with a remark or a transaction labeled as such â€” none are shown in this data).\n\n## 2. Find Initial Paid-in Capital\nLook for all initial injections:\n- | Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | ... | 5000000.0 |\n- | Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | ... | 15000000.0 |\n- | Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | ... | 8000000.0 |\n\nPaid-in Capital = Cash Deposit + Bank Deposit + Direct Fixed Asset Investment\n\nPaid-in Capital Initial =  \n= 5,000,000.00  \n+ 15,000,000.00  \n+ 8,000,000.00  \n= 28,000,000.00\n\n## 3. Check for Any Capital Changes\nSearch for any transaction that indicates additional capital injections/reductions after the initial ones. \n- There are none. All other transactions are regular business activities, not new capital infusions.\n\n## 4. Paid-in Capital End Value\nSince there are no increases or decreases, initial = end value.\n\n## 5. Formatting the Answer\n- Keep two decimals.\n\n## Solution Output\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\", \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"28000000.00\"} }\n```",
