                        "content": "Let's solve the task step by step:\n\n## 1. Find the Initial Bank Deposit\n\nFrom initial balances:\n- | Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | ... | amount: 15,000,000.0\n\nSo:\n```\nBank Deposits Initial Value = 15,000,000.00\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify All Transactions That Affect Bank Deposits\n\nBank deposits change through:\n- Money in: \"Cash to bank transfer\", \"Cash receipts via bank\", etc.\n- Money out: \"Bank Transfer\" or \"Paid\" purchases/expenses with \"Bank Transfer\" or similar.\n\n**Ignore**:\n- \"Cash\" payment or receipt (those affect cash, not bank).\n- \"Account Payable/Receivable\", \"Unpaid\", etc (no actual movement yet).\n- \"Paid\" with \"Bank Transfer\" affects bank balance (out).\n- \"Paid\" with \"Cash\" does **not** affect bank balance.\n\nAlso, \"Bank to cash transfer\" is money transferred out of bank (i.e. minus to bank).\n\"Cash to bank transfer\" is money moved INTO bank (i.e. plus to bank).\n\n---\n\n### ### Step 2.1 — Go through each transaction and list the effect\n\n#### PURCHASES (Paid by Bank Transfer):\n\n- Purchase20231231002 | Purchase | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount: 2,000,000.0 |  (Bank -2,000,000.0)\n- Purchase20231231003 | Purchase | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount: 800,000.0    |  (Bank -800,000.0)\n- Purchase20231231004 | Purchase | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount: 1,000,000.0 |  (Bank -1,000,000.0)\n- Purchase20231231005 | Purchase | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount: 3,000,000.0 |  (Bank -3,000,000.0)\n- Purchase20231231006 | Purchase | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount: 800,000.0    |  (Bank -800,000.0)\n- Purchase20231231007 | Purchase | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount: 800,000.0    |  (Bank -800,000.0)\n- Purchase20231231010 | Purchase | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount: 2,000,000.0 |  (Bank -2,000,000.0)\n\n#### FixedAsset Purchases\n\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount: 871,751.87 | (Bank -871,751.87)\n- FixedAsset20231231001 (2nd) | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount: 577,494.56 | (Bank -577,494.56)\n- FixedAsset20231231001 (3rd) | Paid | Bank Transfer | amount: 1,046,775.17 | (Bank -1,046,775.17)\n\n#### PURCHASES (Bank Transfer, verified):\n\nLet me verify all purchases with Paid + Bank Transfer.\n\n#### SALES\n\nFor sales, unless explicitly \"Paid\" and mentions \"payment_method\" involving a bank, sales do NOT increase bank deposits directly (all \"Cash\", \"Account Receivable\", etc).\n\nIf a sale is listed as \"Paid\" with \"Bank\", it is a bank deposit (but I don't see evidence of this here).\n\n#### \"Bank to cash transfer\" and \"Cash to bank transfer\"\n\n- Bank to cash transfer (bank out to cash, i.e., decrease in bank balance)\n    - Transfer20240117001 | 1,000,000.0  (Bank -1,000,000.0)\n    - Transfer20240203001 | 1,000,000.0  (Bank -1,000,000.0)\n    - Transfer20240204001 | 1,000,000.0  (Bank +1,000,000.0)   # Wait, this is \"Cash to bank\" called \"Cash to bank transfer\" (plus), but Transaction type is \"Bank to cash transfer\"\n- Transfer20240204001 | Cash to bank transfer | 1,000,000.0 (Bank +1,000,000.0)\n\n  Wait, need to check if \"transfer\" is IN or OUT on each.\n\n  Actually, let's step through, find all transfer types and check their effect:\n\n- Transfer20240117001 | Bank to cash transfer | 1,000,000.0 (Bank -> Cash = DECREASE bank)\n- Transfer20240203001 | Bank to cash transfer | 1,000,000.0 (Bank -> Cash = DECREASE bank)\n- Transfer20240204001 | Cash to bank transfer | 1,000,000.0 (Cash -> Bank = INCREASE bank)\n- Transfer20240204001 | Bank to cash transfer | 1,000,000.0 (Bank -> Cash = DECREASE bank)\n- Transfer20240205001 | Cash to bank transfer | 1,000,000.0 (Cash -> Bank = INCREASE bank)\n\nSo, the transfers are:\n- -1,000,000 (Bank to cash)\n- -1,000,000 (Bank to cash)\n- +1,000,000 (Cash to bank)\n- -1,000,000 (Bank to cash)\n- +1,000,000 (Cash to bank)\n\nHowever, multiple transfers on the same day may be internal entries, only net effect matters per date if they match.\n\nBut, process as entered.\n\n---\n\nNow build the sum stepwise.\n\n### Step 3 — Sum Up All Effects\n\n#### 3.1 Initial amount:\n\nStart: +15,000,000.00\n\n#### 3.2 Purchases Paid by Bank Transfer and Fixed Asset Purchases\n\n- Purchase20231231002: -2,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231003: -800,000.00\n- Purchase20231231004: -1,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231005: -3,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231006: -800,000.00\n- Purchase20231231007: -800,000.00\n- Purchase20231231010: -2,000,000.00\n\nSubtotal purchases: \n\n2,000,000 + 800,000 + 1,000,000 + 3,000,000 + 800,000 + 800,000 + 2,000,000 = 10,400,000.00\n\nSo, -10,400,000.00 from bank\n\n- FixedAsset20231231001: -871,751.87\n- FixedAsset20231231001: -577,494.56\n- FixedAsset20231231001: -1,046,775.17\n\nSubtotal fixed assets:\n871,751.87 + 577,494.56 + 1,046,775.17 = 2,495,021.60\nSo, -2,495,021.60\n\n#### 3.3 Transfers\n\n- Transfer20240117001 | Bank to cash transfer | -1,000,000.00\n- Transfer20240203001 | Bank to cash transfer | -1,000,000.00\n- Transfer20240204001 | Cash to bank transfer | +1,000,000.00\n- Transfer20240204001 (second entry, but labeled as \"Bank to cash transfer\" again?) Must be a duplicate or opposite, seems to be a pair of entries to double-entry, but only net one actual effect per unique transfer, but let's process as given\n\n- Transfer20240205001 | Cash to bank transfer | +1,000,000.00\n\nTotal bank to cash: -1,000,000.00 (T1) -1,000,000.00 (T2) -1,000,000.00 (T4) = -3,000,000.00\nTotal cash to bank: +1,000,000.00 (T3) +1,000,000.00 (T5) = +2,000,000.00\n\nNet effect of transfers: -1,000,000.00\n\n#### 3.4 Any other effect? \n\n- Purchases, Fixed Asset Purchases, and Transfers have been covered.\n\n- Are there any other payments \"Paid\" using Bank Transfer? Let's check expenses, seeing if any mention \"Paid\" + \"Bank Transfer\":\n\nExpenses:\n- Mostly Paid with Cash -> No effect on Bank\n- \"Paid | Bank Transfer\" — None among expenses.\n\nThus, no extra effect.\n\n#### 3.5 Total Calculation\n\nStart: +15,000,000.00\n\nMinus Purchases (by bank):          -10,400,000.00\nMinus Fixed Asset Purchases (bank): -2,495,021.60\nMinus net transfers:                -1,000,000.00\n\nTotal movement OUT of bank: 10,400,000.00 + 2,495,021.60 + 1,000,000.00 = **13,895,021.60**\n\nEnd balance: 15,000,000.00 - 13,895,021.60 = **1,104,978.40**\n\n---\n\nWait, let's CHECK if we have missed any \"Purchase\" entries (Paid, Bank Transfer).\n\nLet's list ONLY those purchases and fixed asset purchases:\n\nFrom the data above, these are the relevant records:\n\n- Purchase20231231002 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 2,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231003 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 800,000.0\n- Purchase20231231004 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 1,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231005 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 3,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231006 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 800,000.0\n- Purchase20231231007 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 800,000.0\n- Purchase20231231010 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 2,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231009 | Paid | Cash | 1,000,000.0 (NO, cash)\n- Purchase20231231008 | Paid | Cash | 3,000,000.0 (NO, cash)\n- Purchase20231231001 | Paid | Cash | 800,000.0 (NO, cash)\n- Purchase20231231011 | Unpaid | Account Payable | 1,000,000.0 (NO, not paid)\n- Purchase20231231012 | Paid | Cash | 3,000,000.0 (NO, cash)\n\nTotaling up, purchases by bank transfer sum:\n[2,000,000 + 800,000 + 1,000,000 + 3,000,000 + 800,000 + 800,000 + 2,000,000] = 10,400,000.00\n\nSimilarly, fixed asset purchases:\n\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 871,751.87\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 577,494.56\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Paid | Bank Transfer | 1,046,775.17\n\nSum: [871,751.87 + 577,494.56 + 1,046,775.17] = 2,495,021.60\n\n#### Now add up the transfer effects.\n\n- Transfer20240117001 | Bank to cash transfer | 1,000,000.0 (OUT = -)\n- Transfer20240203001 | Bank to cash transfer | 1,000,000.0 (OUT = -)\n- Transfer20240204001 | Cash to bank transfer | 1,000,000.0 (IN = +)\n- Transfer20240204001 | Bank to cash transfer | 1,000,000.0 (OUT = -)\n- Transfer20240205001 | Cash to bank transfer | 1,000,000.0 (IN = +)\n\nHere, what matters is the net effect per actual movement. But since all are present, add up:\n- OUT: -1,000,000.0 (T1)\n- OUT: -1,000,000.0 (T2)\n- IN: +1,000,000.0 (T3)\n- OUT: -1,000,000.0 (T4)\n- IN: +1,000,000.0 (T5)\n\nSum = (-1M) + (-1M) + 1M + (-1M) + 1M = -1,000,000\n\n#### Compute Final Bank Deposit\n\nStart: 15,000,000.00\n\n- Purchases (Bank):           -10,400,000.00\n- Fixed Assets (Bank):         -2,495,021.60\n- Net Bank-cash Transfers:     -1,000,000.00\n\nAdd up:\n10,400,000.00 + 2,495,021.60 + 1,000,000.00 = 13,895,021.60\n\nFinal: 15,000,000.00 - 13,895,021.60 = **1,104,978.40**\n\n---\n\n## Cross-check for any missed items\n\nSome \"Sale\" may be \"Paid\" by bank, but in these records, Sale always shows Paid with blank or with nothing under payment_method (so presumed cash or unspecified), unless stated (none seem to specify bank).\n\n### ## Conclusion\n\n### Final Answer in required format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"15000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"1104978.40\"} }\n```\n---\n\n## Explanation:\n- Start: Bank deposit = 15,000,000.00\n- Outflows (purchases, fixed assets, net bank→cash transfers): 13,895,021.60\n- End: 15,000,000.00 - 13,895,021.60 = 1,104,978.40\n\n---\n\n**Final JSON:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"15000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"1104978.40\"} }\n```",
