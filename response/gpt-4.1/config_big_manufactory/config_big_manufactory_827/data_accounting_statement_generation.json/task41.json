This means:\n\n- **Increase** in Accounts Payable = Purchases made and not paid at the end of the period (i.e., balance of accounts payable).\n- **Decrease** (or \"less increase\") = If accounts payable was settled (paid off) during the period.\n\n**Relevant transactions:**\n- Purchases that are unpaid (specifically \"Unpaid\", and payment method: \"Account Payable\").\n- In this data, only one such transaction is present at the end of the period:\n\n| id               | type     | date        | amount     | payment/receipt_status | payment_method         | supplier_id | product_id     | quantity | unit_price | \n|------------------|----------|-------------|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------|---------------|----------|------------|\n| Purchase20231231011 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 1,000,000.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable        | S002        | P001          | 2.0      | 500,000.0  |\n\n**All other purchases are \"Paid\" (settled immediately):**\nThus, at the end of the period, the balance of accounts payable consists of 1,000,000. There is no indication of a beginning balance of A/P (because it's not mentioned in the \"initial\" entries); we assume accounts payable was zero at the beginning.\n\n## Step 2: Interpret the Requirement\n\nBased on the examples and the problem, it's asking:\n- **\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\"** â€“ this is the _change in accounts payable_, which is the balance of A/P at period end minus A/P at period beginning. Here, only 1 purchase is unpaid at the end, so the increase is **1,000,000.00**.\n\n## Step 3: Write the Solution\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"1000000.00\"} }\n```",
