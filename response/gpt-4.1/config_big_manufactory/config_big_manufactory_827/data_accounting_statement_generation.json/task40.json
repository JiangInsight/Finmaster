Inventory Purchases (additions, 'Purchase' type with product)\nSum all amounts for *Purchase* items (only inventory, i.e., ignore Fixed Assets):\n\n| ID                 | Description       | Product Name         | Amount     |\n|--------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------|\n| Purchase20231231001| Purchase         | Heavy Equipment B    | 800,000    |\n| Purchase20231231002| Purchase         | Heavy Equipment C    | 2,000,000  |\n| Purchase20231231003| Purchase         | Heavy Equipment B    | 800,000    |\n| Purchase20231231004| Purchase         | Heavy Equipment A    | 1,000,000  |\n| Purchase20231231005| Purchase         | Heavy Equipment D    | 3,000,000  |\n| Purchase20231231006| Purchase         | Heavy Equipment B    | 800,000    |\n| Purchase20231231007| Purchase         | Heavy Equipment B    | 800,000    |\n| Purchase20231231008| Purchase         | Heavy Equipment D    | 3,000,000  |\n| Purchase20231231009| Purchase         | Heavy Equipment A    | 1,000,000  |\n| Purchase20231231010| Purchase         | Heavy Equipment C    | 2,000,000  |\n| Purchase20231231011| Purchase         | Heavy Equipment A    | 1,000,000  |\n| Purchase20231231012| Purchase         | Heavy Equipment D    | 3,000,000  |\n\nAdd up amounts:\n```\n800,000  (B, 1)\n+2,000,000 (C, 2)\n+800,000  (B, 3)\n+1,000,000 (A, 4)\n+3,000,000 (D, 5)\n+800,000  (B, 6)\n+800,000  (B, 7)\n+3,000,000 (D, 8)\n+1,000,000 (A, 9)\n+2,000,000 (C, 10)\n+1,000,000 (A, 11)\n+3,000,000 (D, 12)\n=\nTOTAL PURCHASES = 19,200,000.00\n```\n\n### 2. Inventory COGS (reductions, 'Sale' type, use cost_amount)\nSum all cost_amount on sales with a product (ignore 'Sale' where cost_amount is blank):\n\n| ID               | Description   | Product Name         | cost_amount|\n|------------------|--------------|----------------------|------------|\n| Sale20240103001  | Sale         | Heavy Equipment B    | 800,000    |\n| Sale20240106004  | Sale         | Heavy Equipment A    | 500,000    |\n| Sale20240107005  | Sale         | Heavy Equipment C    | 1,000,000  |\n| Sale20240108008  | Sale         | Heavy Equipment B    | 800,000    |\n| Sale20240109009  | Sale         | Heavy Equipment D    | 1,500,000  |\n| Sale20240111011  | Sale         | Heavy Equipment D    | 1,500,000  |\n| Sale20240117017  | Sale         | Heavy Equipment A    | 500,000    |\n| Sale20240122024  | Sale         | Heavy Equipment A    | 500,000    |\n| Sale20240124028  | Sale         | Heavy Equipment A    | 500,000    |\n| Sale20240125030  | Sale         | Heavy Equipment C    | 1,000,000  |\n| Sale20240129034  | Sale         | Heavy Equipment D    | 1,500,000  |\n| Sale20240131038  | Sale         | Heavy Equipment D    | 1,500,000  |\n| Sale20240205042  | Sale         | Heavy Equipment D    | 1,500,000  |\n\nAdd up all the cost_amount values:\n```\n800,000  (B)\n+500,000 (A)\n+1,000,000 (C)\n+800,000 (B)\n+1,500,000 (D)\n+1,500,000 (D)\n+500,000 (A)\n+500,000 (A)\n+500,000 (A)\n+1,000,000 (C)\n+1,500,000 (D)\n+1,500,000 (D)\n+1,500,000 (D)\n=\nTOTAL COGS = 12,600,000.00\n```\n\n### 3. Fixed Asset Purchases (not inventory, do not include)\n\nWe do **NOT** include Fixed Assets Purchase entries nor their amounts.\n\n---\n\n## Calculation\n\n**(Increase) Decrease in Inventory** = (Ending Inventory â€“ Beginning Inventory)\nBut the way it flows in the cash flow statement (\"indirect method\"):\n\n    (Increase)/Decrease = Opening Inventory + Purchases - COGS - Ending Inventory\nBut since we are to compute just Purchases - COGS (assuming that beginning/ending inventory are zero for this period, as is usual with a new cash flow), the cash flow adjustment is:\n\n    Increase in Inventory = Purchases - COGS\n\nAs per cash flow statement, **an increase in inventory is a use of cash (negative),** so it's shown as a negative number.\n\n#### Calculation:\n```\nPurchases = 19,200,000.00\nCOGS (inventory out) = 12,600,000.00\n\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory = Purchases - COGS = 19,200,000.00 - 12,600,000.00 = 6,600,000.00\n ==>\nThis is a net **increase of inventory** of 6,600,000.00 (i.e., cash was used to fund more inventory).\n\nIn the cash flow statement, it's shown as:\n \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-6,600,000.00\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-6600000.00\"} }\n```",
