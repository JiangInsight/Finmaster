Our goal is to compute TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS for:\n1. **Initial value** (start of period, i.e., at 2023-12-31, before any operations).\n2. **Final value** (end of period, i.e., after all visible transactions, at 2024-02-05).\n\n**Current Assets typically include:**\n- Cash and Bank balances\n- Account Receivables (amounts from sales not yet received)\n- Interest Receivables (interest earned but not yet received)\n- Inventory (goods purchased/produced but not yet sold, at cost)\n\n**Notes:**\n- Fixed assets, like \"Fixed Assets Purchase\", are NOT current assets.\n- Unpaid purchases (Account Payable) would affect inventory but are not current assets themselves.\n- Ignore depreciation, expenses, and profit: these affect retained earnings, net profit, or fixed assets, but not the balance of current asset classes themselves.\n\n---\n### **Step 1: Initial Value at 2023-12-31**\n\nFrom the provided data:\n\n- **Cash deposit:** 5,000,000.00\n- **Bank deposit:** 15,000,000.00\n\n**Inventory:**  \nCompute all purchases BEFORE any sales.\n- Purchase20231231001: 800,000.00 (Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit)\n- Purchase20231231002: 2,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment C, 2 units)\n- Purchase20231231003: 800,000.00 (Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit)\n- Purchase20231231004: 1,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment A, 2 units)\n- Purchase20231231005: 3,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment D, 2 units)\n- Purchase20231231006: 800,000.00 (Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit)\n- Purchase20231231007: 800,000.00 (Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit)\n- Purchase20231231008: 3,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment D, 2 units)\n- Purchase20231231009: 1,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment A, 2 units)\n- Purchase20231231010: 2,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment C, 2 units)\n- Purchase20231231011: 1,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment A, 2 units) — **Unpaid**\n- Purchase20231231012: 3,000,000.00 (Heavy Equipment D, 2 units)\n\n**Let's clarify: which purchases are for inventory (current asset) and which are fixed assets?**\n- All the \"Purchase...\" rows with product names look like inventory: heavy equipment.\n    - Ignore \"Fixed Assets\" lines (these are under fixed asset, not inventory).\n    - Ignore any \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" lines.\n\nInventory (at cost), adding up the cost for each purchase:\n- Purchase20231231001: 800,000.00\n- Purchase20231231002: 2,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231003: 800,000.00\n- Purchase20231231004: 1,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231005: 3,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231006: 800,000.00\n- Purchase20231231007: 800,000.00\n- Purchase20231231008: 3,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231009: 1,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231010: 2,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231011: 1,000,000.00 (UNPAID, but still inventory, since we're using accrual)\n- Purchase20231231012: 3,000,000.00\n\nNow, sum these:\n\n| Purchase                   | Amount      |\n|----------------------------|------------|\n| Purchase20231231001        | 800,000    |\n| Purchase20231231002        | 2,000,000  |\n| Purchase20231231003        | 800,000    |\n| Purchase20231231004        | 1,000,000  |\n| Purchase20231231005        | 3,000,000  |\n| Purchase20231231006        | 800,000    |\n| Purchase20231231007        | 800,000    |\n| Purchase20231231008        | 3,000,000  |\n| Purchase20231231009        | 1,000,000  |\n| Purchase20231231010        | 2,000,000  |\n| Purchase20231231011        | 1,000,000  |\n| Purchase20231231012        | 3,000,000  |\n| **TOTAL INVENTORY**        | **18,000,000** |\n\nNo sales have been made before 2023-12-31, so full inventory stays.\n\n**Summary at 2023-12-31:**\n- Cash: 5,000,000.00\n- Bank: 15,000,000.00\n- Inventory: 18,000,000.00\n- Account/interest receivable: 0 (no sales/interest yet)\n\n**Total Current Assets Initial Value = 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 18,000,000 = 38,000,000.00**\n\n---\n### **Step 2: Final Value at End of Transactions (~2024-02-05)**\n\n#### 2a. **Cash and Bank Balance**\n\nStart:  \n- Cash: 5,000,000  \n- Bank: 15,000,000  \n\nThen, we must consider:\n- **Cash/bank inflows:** from sales received in cash/bank, transfers from bank to cash and cash to bank\n- **Cash/bank outflows:** purchases paid, all paid expenses, etc.\n\nBut since there are many transfers between cash and bank, just sum both at end together.\nSo, Total cash + bank we can get by tracking total inflow/outflow impacting both.\n\nBut more simply, as all cash and bank are current assets, whether it's in cash or bank, count together as a total. Since only transfers cash<->bank, their sum keeps constant, only payments/receipts change the sum.\n\nSo:  \nStart: cash+bank: **20,000,000.00**\n\n#### 2b. **Purchases/Sale - Inventory, Account Receivable, and Cash**\n\nWe must track:\n- Purchases: increase inventory (at cost)\n- Sales: decrease inventory (at cost), increase A/R if unpaid, increase cash/bank if paid\n- Unpaid purchases: still inventory, cash outflow is not yet\n- Expenses paid: reduce cash/bank\n\n#### 2c. **Account Receivable**\n- Any sale marked **Unpaid** or **Account Receivable** for the amount after_tax_amount is added to A/R\n- Paid sales: cash/bank up, inventory down.\n\n#### 2d. **Interest Receivable**\n- Each \"Interest Receivables\" line with unpaid status adds to interest receivable (current asset).\n\n---\n#### **Let’s process transactions step-by-step:**\n\n##### **INVENTORY MOVEMENTS**\n\n**Start inventory:** 18,000,000.00 (computed above at cost).\n\n##### **Sales:**\nLet's record, for each sale:\n- What was the cost of the item sold? That needs to be subtracted from inventory.\n- Was it paid? If yes, cash/bank increases; if unpaid, A/R increases.\n\nLet’s process each sale, in chronological order, and reduce inventory accordingly.\n\n**We also need to match inventory by each product, as cost per unit may differ. However, all inventory is heavy equipment: A, B, C, D (from the Purchase lines) and the sales match those.\n\nLet's keep track of how much of each equipment we have.  \nFrom purchases (initial inventory):\n\n| Equipment   | Units | Cost per unit | Total        |\n|-------------|-------|---------------|--------------|\n| A           | 2+2+2=6     | 500,000       | 3,000,000  |\n| B           | 1+1+1+1=4   | 800,000       | 3,200,000  |\n| C           | 2+2=4       | 1,000,000     | 4,000,000  |\n| D           | 2+2+2=6     | 1,500,000     | 9,000,000  |\n| (From purchase20231231011, unpaid but included in inventory.) |\n\nAnd one D from purchase20231231005 and one D from purchase20231231008, each at 1,500,000\n\nLet’s correct units:\nFrom the purchases above:\n- purchase20231231004: (Heavy Equipment A, 2 units, 1,000,000)\n- purchase20231231009: (Heavy Equipment A, 2 units, 1,000,000)\n- purchase20231231011: (Heavy Equipment A, 2 units, 1,000,000, unpaid)\n\nSo actually for A: purchase20231231004 (2), purchase20231231009 (2), purchase20231231011 (2) => 6 units @500,000 per unit\n\n- purchase20231231001: (Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit, 800,000)\n- purchase20231231003: (Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit, 800,000)\n- purchase20231231006: (Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit, 800,000)\n- purchase20231231007: (Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit, 800,000)\n  So B: 4 units @ 800,000 = 3,200,000\n\n- purchase20231231002: (Heavy Equipment C, 2 units, 1,000,000)\n- purchase20231231010: (Heavy Equipment C, 2 units, 1,000,000)\n  So C: 4 units @ 1,000,000 = 4,000,000\n\n- purchase20231231005: (Heavy Equipment D, 2 units, 1,500,000)\n- purchase20231231008: (Heavy Equipment D, 2 units, 1,500,000)\n- purchase20231231012: (Heavy Equipment D, 2 units, 1,500,000)\nSo D: 6 units @ 1,500,000 = 9,000,000\n\nLet’s list this as initial physical inventory:\n\n\n| Product            | Units | Cost per unit | Total Cost   |\n|--------------------|-------|---------------|--------------|\n| Heavy Equipment A  | 6     | 500,000       | 3,000,000    |\n| Heavy Equipment B  | 4     | 800,000       | 3,200,000    |\n| Heavy Equipment C  | 4     | 1,000,000     | 4,000,000    |\n| Heavy Equipment D  | 6     | 1,500,000     | 9,000,000    |\n| **Total**              |       |               | **19,200,000**|\n\nWait, above calculation gives 19,200,000 not 18,000,000 — does the above agree with purchase COST?
