These are inventory or merchandise, NOT fixed assets.\n\n- No other lines have type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar wording indicating additional fixed asset acquisition.\n\n---\n\n**Check for other possible fixed asset purchases hidden under \"Purchase\" but with asset_name/asset_type:**\n- All other \"Purchase\" lines clearly indicate products (with product_name like Heavy Equipment D, B, C, etc.)—these are goods-inventory for resale.\n- Only \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" with asset_name/asset_type is for actual fixed asset (as in example).\n\n---\n\n**Unpaid transactions?**\n- Both found \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" entries are already marked as \"Paid\". No need to adjust.\n- No indication of unpaid fixed asset purchases.\n\n---\n\n**SUM:**  \n871751.87 + 577494.56 = **1,624,246.43**  \nBut double-checking their exact amounts:\n\n- 871751.87 (Heavy Machinery4)\n- 577494.56 (Production Line Equipment6)\n\n**Total = 871,751.87 + 577,494.56 = 1,624,246.43**\n\nHowever, in your provided text, for the second entry, the amount is **577494.56**, but my answer above had 577,517.86, which is a typo. Let's be precise:\n\n- 871751.87\n- 577494.56  \n= 1,624,246.43\n\n**Present according to your expected format:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"1624246.43\"} }\n```\n**(Note: In my initial top answer, I wrote 1624269.73, which was an error due to misreading the second value. The correct sum is 1,624,246.43.)**\n\n---\n\n**Final answer, in expected format:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"1624246.43\"} }\n```",
