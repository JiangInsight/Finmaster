TOTAL ASSETS INITIAL VALUE\n\nLook for rows with type \"Initial...\" (initial balance sheet at 2023-12-31):\n\n| type              | recorded_amount |\n|-------------------|----------------|\n| Cash deposit      | 5,000,000.00   |\n| Bank deposit      | 15,000,000.00  |\n| Fixed Assets      | 8,000,000.00   |\n\n**Sum:**\n\n5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = **28,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### 2. TOTAL ASSETS END VALUE\n\nNext, determine what must be included as assets, at the end date.\n\nAssets on balance sheet typically include:  \n- **Cash**\n- **Bank**\n- **Account Receivable (A/R)**\n- **Inventories (if not all sold)**\n- **Fixed Assets (net of depreciation)**\n- **Interest Receivable (not yet paid)**\n\nWe will go step by step:\n\n#### (A) Cash and Bank Balances\n\n##### First, collect starting balances:\n- Cash: 5,000,000\n- Bank: 15,000,000\n\n##### Next, process inflows and outflows:\n\n- **Purchases** decrease cash or bank (depending on payment method)\n- **Sales (Paid)** increase cash or bank\n- **Transfers** just move between cash/bank, net effect zero.\n- **Expenses** decrease cash/bank\n- **Fixed Asset Purchases** decrease cash/bank, increase fixed assets\n- **Depreciation** affects fixed assets (not cash)\n- **Interest Receivable** is not cash until paid; it's a receivable (so will be in A/R or interest receivable asset)\n- **Unpaid Purchase** should create account payable (not an asset)\n- **Unpaid Sale** should create A/R asset\n\nWe need to see cash+bank net movement for all **actual paid** transactions.\n\nLet’s keep a running total for Cash and Bank.\n\n**Let’s make a short tabulation of money movement, summarized:**\n\n##### Cash movement\n\nStart: 5,000,000\n\nNow process the payments for:\n\n- Purchases (Paid by Cash)\n- Purchases (Paid by Bank Transfer)\n- Expenses (Paid by Cash)\n- Fixed Asset Purchases (Paid by Bank Transfer)\n- Sales (Paid: Cash or Bank)\n- Transfers (Bank <-> Cash) (Net zero, but let’s track to split ending cash/bank)\n- Unpaid sales/purchases do not affect cash/bank immediately.\n\nWe will also need to track the transfer events to split ending cash/bank.\n\n\nLet's scan the data and sum up:\n\n---\n\n#### (i) All **Purchases** (Paid) -- cash and bank split\n\nLook for \"Purchase...\" type, payment_method, payment_status:\n\n\n| id                  | amount    | payment_status  | payment_method    |\n|---------------------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | 800,000   | Paid            | Cash             |\n| Purchase20231231002 |2,000,000  | Paid            | Bank Transfer    |\n| Purchase20231231003 | 800,000   | Paid            | Bank Transfer    |\n| Purchase20231231004 |1,000,000  | Paid            | Bank Transfer    |\n| Purchase20231231005 |3,000,000  | Paid            | Bank Transfer    |\n| Purchase20231231006 | 800,000   | Paid            | Bank Transfer    |\n| Purchase20231231007 | 800,000   | Paid            | Bank Transfer    |\n| Purchase20231231008 |3,000,000  | Paid            | Cash             |\n| Purchase20231231009 |1,000,000  | Paid            | Cash             |\n| Purchase20231231010

affect cash, but asset side in inventory), and calculate inventory at close later.\n\nAlso, note: Purchase20231231011 is \"Unpaid\" so that is **not paid**, so does NOT impact cash/bank now.\n\nSo, sum as per cash/bank:\n\n##### Purchases Paid WITH **CASH**:\n\n| id                   | amount |\n|----------------------|--------|\n| Purchase20231231001  | 800,000|\n| Purchase20231231008

TRANSFER**:\n\n| id                   | amount |\n|----------------------|--------|\n| Purchase20231231002  |2,000,000|\n| Purchase20231231003  | 800,000|\n| Purchase20231231004  |1,000,000|\n|

+ 800,000 + 2,000,000 = **9,400,000**\n\n---\n\n#### (ii) **Expenses** Paid by Cash (and Financial Expenses)\n\nFind all \"Expense...\" type, payment_method == \"Cash\" and payment_status == \"Paid\".\n\nLet’s sum all those Expense rows' amounts:\n\nSum:\n\n- 31,077.04\n- 72,434.17\n- 73,422.33\n- 41,635.89\n- 88,194.75\n- 57,286.12\n- 52,101.64\n- 19,433.8\n- 50,312.93\n- 18,529.12\n-

the data only one for HeavyMa..., one for Industrial..., and one for Production Line...\n Let's sum them up:\n\n871,751.87 + 1,046,775.17 + 577,494.56 = **2,495,021.6**\n\nThese amounts will reduce cash/bank, and will increase fixed assets (so included on both sides).\n\n---\n\n#### (iv) **Sales**\n\nLook for \"Sale...\" type. If paid, increases cash or bank.\n\nFields:\n- amount\n- cost_amount (inventory reduction)\n- payment_status: if \"Paid\", adds to cash/bank; if \"Unpaid\", A/R.\n\nGo through each sale entry:\n- If \"Paid\", cash/bank increases by \"amount\"\n- If \"Unpaid\", it's an Account Receivable at period end.\n\nLet’s check all sales lines, sum amounts by Paid/Unpaid.\n\n#### SALES (Quick scan - only PARTIAL DATA shown here;
