                        "content": "Let's solve the \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" for the provided example step by step:\n\n## 1. What does this item mean?\n\n- In the Operating Activities section of a Cash Flow Statement (using the Indirect Method), we adjust Net Profit for changes in working capital items.\n- **Interest Receivable** is an asset account. An **increase** in Interest Receivable indicates accrual of interest income not yet received in cash (non-cash), so subtract the increase; a **decrease** means cash interest collected exceeded accrual, so add the decrease.\n- The adjustment = **Opening Balance - Closing Balance of Interest Receivable**.\n\n## 2. Identify Opening and Closing Balances\n\n### Opening Balance: \n- From the data, the first date is **2024-01-01**\n- Check for opening Interest Receivable. The first listed entry is:\n    - 2024-01-01: Interest Receivables: 1,335.0\n  So, opening balance as of **2024-01-01** = **1,335.0**\n\n### Closing Balance:\n- Find the **last** Interest Receivable balance, i.e. the last date **before/including 2024-02-05**:\n    - 2024-02-05: Interest Receivables: 98.25407759999999\n- However, to get the **cumulative balance at 2024-02-05**, we should sum up all increases, assuming these are the only entries (no cash collected or write-off events recorded - which matches the pattern of example you provided).\n\n#### Therefore:\n- Sum up all Interest Receivable entries from 2024-01-01 to **2024-02-05** (i.e., add each entry in the dataset).\n- Opening balance is only the very **first day's entry**.\n\nBut, are these *only* the new *accruals* (i.e. each row is new accrued amount, so cumulative = opening + all entries), or are these the *balances* as of that day? Looking at the design and the provided example, these are **new accruals**. So we sum all these to find total accrual as of closing date.\n\n**So:**\n- (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable = Opening Balance - Closing Balance\n- Where \n    - Opening = only the first entry (2024-01-01)\n    - Closing = sum of all accruals\n\n## 3.

Let's tabulate the increments for easy verification.)\n\nAlternatively, sum the \"big blocks\" (eyeball):\n\n- 1,335.0 (x2) = 2,670.0\n- 1,157.0 + 1,085.8 + 996.8 + 729.8 = 1,157.0 + 1,085.8 = 2,242.8 + 996.8 = 3,239.6 + 729.8 = 3,969.4\n- Next, two lines of 658.6 = 1,317.2\n- 587.4 + 2 lines of 509.81408357 = 587.4 + 1,019.62816714 = 1,607.02816714\n- 5 lines of 331.81408357 = 1,659.07041785\n- 2 lines of 242.81408357 = 485.62816714\n- 5 lines of 149.65109344 = 748.2554672\n- 9 lines of 98.25407760 = 884.2866984\n- 2 lines of 9.25407760 = 18.5081552\n\nLet's sum each block:\n- First two: 2,670.0\n- Next four: 3,969.4\n  Cumulative: 6,639.4\n- Next two: 1,317.2 → 7,956.6\n- Then: 1,607.02816714 → 9,563.62816714\n- Next five: 1,659.07041785 → 11,222.69858499\n- Next two: 485.62816714 → 11,708.32675213\n- Next five: 748.2554672 → 12,456.58221933\n- Next nine: 884.2866984 → 13,340.86891773\n- Next two: 18.5081552 → **13,359.37707293**\n\nSo this is a bit off—why? There are 37 Interest Receivable items, but above seems to miss a few.\n\nRewriting the full sum quickly for transparency:\n\n- 2024-01-01: 1,335.00\n- 2024-01-02: 1,335.00 (2,670.00)\n- 2024-01-03: 1,157.00 (3,827.00)\n- 2024-01-04: 1,085.80 (4,912.80)\n- 2024-01-05: 996.80 (5,909.60)\n- 2024-01-06: 729.80 (6,639.40)\n- 2024-01-07: 658.60 (7,298.00)\n- 2024-01-08: 658.60 (7,956.60)\n- 2024-01-09: 587.40 (8,544.00)\n- 2024-01-10: 509.81408357 (9,053.81408357)\n- 2024-01-11: 509.81408357 (9,563.62816714)\n- 2024-01-12: 331.81408357 (9,895.44225071)\n- 2024-01-13: 331.81408357 (10,227.25633428)\n- 2024-01-14: 331.81408357 (10,559.07041785)\n- 2024-01-15: 331.81408357 (10,890.88450142)\n- 2024-01-16: 331.81408357 (11,222.69858499)\n- 2024-01-17: 242.81408357 (11,465.51266856)\n- 2024-01-18: 242.81408357 (11,708.32675213)\n- 2024-01-19: 149.65109344 (11,857.97784557)\n- 2024-01-20: 149.65109344 (12,007.62893901)\n- 2024-01-21: 149.65109344 (12,157.28003245)\n- 2024-01-22: 149.65109344 (12,306.93112589)\n- 2024-01-23: 149.65109344 (12,456.58221933)\n- 2024-01-24: 98.25407760 (12,554.83629693)\n- 2024-01-25: 98.25407760 (12,653.09037453)\n- 2024-01-26: 98.25407760 (12,751.34445213)\n- 2024-01-27: 98.25407760 (12,849.59852973)\n- 2024-01-28: 98.25407760 (12,947.85260733)\n- 2024-01-29: 98.25407760 (13,046.10668493)\n- 2024-01-30: 98.25407760 (13,144.36076253)\n- 2024-01-31: 98.25407760 (13,242.61484013)\n- 2024-02-01: 98.25407760 (13,340.86891773)\n- 2024-02-02: 98.25407760 (13,439.12299533)\n- 2024-02-03: 9.25407760 (13,448.37707293)\n- 2024-02-04: 9.25407760 (13,457.63115053)\n- 2024-02-05: 98.25407760 (13,555.88522813)\n\nSo the total sum is **13,555.88522813** (rounded to 2 decimals: 13,555.89).\n\n## 5.
