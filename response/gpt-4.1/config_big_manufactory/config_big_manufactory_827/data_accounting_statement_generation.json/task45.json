                        "content": "Let's proceed step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Investing Activities**\n\nNet Cash Flows from Investing Activities in the Cash Flow Statement typically **include cash paid for the purchase of long-term assets (such as fixed assets, plants, heavy equipment)** and **cash received from the sale of such assets**.\n\nPurchase of inventories for resale or raw materials for production are *operating* activities, but **purchases/sales of assets (like heavy equipment, fixed assets, production equipment, industrial facilities, etc.)** are investing activities.\n\nThus, the investing cash flows are as follows:\n\n### CASH **OUTFLOWS** (for purchases):\nFind all purchases of fixed/long-term assets that are **Paid** (ignore Unpaid/Account Payable, because only cash flows are included).  \n(We *include only the amount that is paid in cash/bank at the time of transaction*.)\n\nThere are two types:\n1. Fixed Assets (explicitly labeled as such)\n2. Purchases that are of *heavy equipment* (long-term asset!) and are **Paid**.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **Fixed Assets Purchase** lines:\n\n1. \"Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | ... | 8000000.0 | 8000000.0 | ...\" — **This is an initial balance** so NOT a cash flow, but a starting point for the balance sheet — **IGNORE** for cash flow.\n2. \"FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 1046775.17 | 1046775.17 | ... | Paid | Bank Transfer ...\" — **PAID**: include -1,046,775.17\n3. \"FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 577494.56 |

-871,751.87\n\n#### 2. **Purchases of Heavy Equipment, etc. (long-term assets), if Paid**\n\nLook for \"Purchase\" lines where the product is a long-term asset (like \"Heavy Equipment X\"), and payment is \"**Paid**\":\n\n- | Purchase20231231001 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 800000.0 | ... | ... | Paid | Cash | ... | ... | Heavy Equipment B | ... | 1.0 | ... | ... |\n  → -800,000.0\n\n- |

yet.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Sales of Fixed/Long-Term Assets** (CASH INFLOWS)\nFind all **Sale** lines where the product is **Heavy Equipment** (not chemical/operating inventory) and **Paid** (i.e., received cash, not on account):\n\nFrom the sales, look for \"Heavy Equipment\" and see if \"**Paid**\":  \n- Sale20240106004 Heavy Equipment A 684,558.74 Paid — +684,558.74  \n- Sale20240107005 Heavy

Sale20240205042 Heavy Equipment D 2,144,176.18 Paid — +2,144,176.18  \n\nAll others: **unpaid/account receivable** --> *not a current cash flow*.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Add Up\n\n#### Outflows:\n-
