Understanding \"Total Liabilities\" on the Balance Sheet\n\n**Total Liabilities** include all amounts owed by the company to outside parties as of the balance sheet date. They include, for example:\n- Accounts Payable (amounts owed to suppliers for purchases received but not yet paid)\n- Loans Payable (not present in the data)\n- Other unpaid obligations (not present unless specifically described)\n\n**Key:** \n- We ignore paid purchases/expenses as they no longer create a liability.\n- We only count \"Unpaid\" items that are *liabilities* (not receivables).\n- Unpaid entries for sales (\"Unpaid\" Account Receivable) are *assets* (money owed to the company), **not liabilities**.\n- Entries like \"Interest Receivables\" (unpaid) are also *assets*.\n\n### 2. Checking the Initial Value\n\nLook for any initial liabilities:\n- All \"Initial20231231001\" records are only:\n    - Cash deposit (asset)\n    - Bank deposit (asset)\n    - Fixed Assets (asset)\n- **No initial liabilities.**\n  \n**Total Liabilities Initial Value:** 0.00\n\n### 3. Identifying Liabilities at End Value\n\nWe look for *outstanding unpaid purchases*, i.e., any \"Unpaid\" transactions representing money the business *owes*.\n\n#### a. \"Unpaid\" Entries in Purchases\n\nLet's check for unpaid purchase entries:\n- Description contains \"Purchase\" and payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\"\n\nThere is only **one** such record:\n\n| id                | type     | ... | amount   | recorded_amount | payment/receipt_status | payment_method   | ... |\n|-------------------|----------|-----|----------|-----------------|-----------------------|------------------|-----|\n| Purchase20231231011 | Purchase | ... | 1000000.0| 1000000.0      | Unpaid                | Account Payable  | ... |\n\nThus, **there is only one unpaid purchase (accounts payable) of 1,000,000.**\n\n#### b. Is Other Liabilities Present?\n\nNo notes payable, loans, or accruals are seen.\n\n#### c. \"Unpaid\" in Other Transactions?\n\nAll \"Unpaid\" for \"Interest Receivables\" and \"Sale\" with account receivable â†’ asset, *ignored* for liability.\n\n### 4. Summing the Total Liabilities\n\n- Only **outstanding accounts payable: 1,000,000.0**\n\n### 5. Final Output\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"1000000.00\"} }\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- At the start, no liabilities.\n- At the end, one accounts payable: 1,000,000.00\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"1000000.00\"} }\n```",
