                        "content": "Let's solve the problem step by step:\n\n## 1. Find Initial Value\nFrom the data (see \"type\" column), the starting value for fixed assets appears in:\n\n| id | type | ... | amount | ... |\n|----|------|-----|--------|-----|\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | ... | 8,000,000.0 | ... |\n\nSo, the initial value is **8,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Additions & Disposals\n\n### 2.1 Additions to Fixed Assets\nLook for all purchases of fixed assets:\n\n- **Only include items registered as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" OR purchases of assets that are not inventory/sale (i.e., not for resale), typically with \"asset_name\", or those whose product is equipment/machinery (non-inventory).**\n\n#### Fixed Assets Purchase lines:\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | ... | 871,751.87 | ... | Heavy Machinery4 | Heavy Machinery\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | ... | 1,046,775.17 | ... | Industrial Facilities5 | Industrial Facilities\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | ... | 577,494.56 | ... | Production Line Equipment6 | Production Line Equipment\n\n#### Purchases of Equipment (presume these are fixed assets, as item types are Heavy Equipment/Production/Machinery):\n\nSum \"amount\" column for the following purchases (exclude those clearly purchased for resale/sale, i.e., with a Sale event for the same product id within the period):\n\n- Purchase20231231001 | Purchase | ... | 800,000.0 | ... | P002 | Heavy Equipment B | 1.0 | 800,000 (sold on 2024-01-03, so it's for resale; exclude)\n- Purchase20231231002 | Purchase | ... | 2,000,000.0 | ... | P003 | Heavy Equipment C | 2.0 | 1,000,000 each (sold on 2024-01-07 etc.)\n- Purchase20231231003 | Purchase | ... | 800,000.0 | ... | P002 | Heavy Equipment B | ...\n...\nFrom the transaction history, the heavy equipment and similar machinery are all sold in subsequent \"Sale\" lines (with matching product id), indicating these are trading inventory, not fixed assets.\nTherefore, their cost is not added to fixed assets on the balance sheet.\n\n**We only include lines labeled Fixed Assets Purchase (with asset_name and asset_type) as additions.**\n\nTotal additional fixed assets:\n- 871,751.87 (Heavy Machinery)\n- 1,046,775.17 (Industrial Facilities)\n- 577,494.56 (Production Line Equipment)\n\n**Sum additions:**  \n871,751.87 + 1,046,775.17 + 577,494.56 = **2,495,021.60**\n\n---\n\n### 2.2 Disposals of Fixed Assets\nDisposal of fixed assets occurs when a fixed asset is sold (not trading inventory). In this dataset, all items with \"Sale\" and product id refer to those previously bought as \"Purchase\" (i.e., inventory trading, not fixed assets).\n\nNothing specifically tagged as sale of Fixed Asset or with an asset_name/asset_type.\n\n**Therefore, no disposal of fixed assets.**\n\n---\n\n### 2.3 Depreciation\nFind all entries with \"type\" == Depreciation:\n\n| Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | ... | 45,751.31 | ... |\n| Depreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | ... | 93,206.48 | ... |\n\nSum:\n45,751.31 + 93,206.48 = **138,957.79**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Calculation\n\n### 3.1 Initial Value\n\n8,000,000.00 \n\n### 3.2 + Additions\n+2,495,021.60\n\n### 3.3 - Disposals\n-0.00\n\n### 3.4 - Depreciation\n-138,957.79\n\n---\n\n### **End Value Calculation:**\n8,000,000.00 + 2,495,021.60 - 0 - 138,957.79 =  \n= 10,356,063.81\n\n---\n\n### **Formatting**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"fixed assets net Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"fixed assets net End Value\": \"10356063.81\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"fixed assets net Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"fixed assets net End Value\": \"10356063.81\"}}\n```",
