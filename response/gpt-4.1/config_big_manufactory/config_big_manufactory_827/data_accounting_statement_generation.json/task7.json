Identify Fixed Assets Initial Value:**\n- Look for the \"Initial\" line with \"Fixed Assets\".\n- Entry: `| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | ... | 8000000.0 |`\n- So, **initial value = 8,000,000.00**\n\n**2. Compute all additions to Fixed Assets during the period:**\n- Filter for:\n  - \"FixedAsset*\" or \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" type transactions,\n  - Purchases of fixed assets that did NOT get sold as inventory (see more below).\n\nIn the provided data:\n- `| FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | ... | 871751.87 | ... | ... | Heavy Machinery4 | Heavy Machinery |`\n- `| FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | ... | 1046775.17 | ... | ... | Industrial Facilities5 | Industrial Facilities |`\n- `| FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | ... | 577494.56 | ... | ... | Production Line Equipment6 | Production Line Equipment |`\n- **Sum these values** to get *fixed assets purchased and still on hand at period end*.\n\n**3. Deduct assets sold and depreciation:**\n\n- Depreciation for the period:\n  - `| Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | ... | 45751.31 |`\n  - `| Depreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | ... | 93206.48 |`\n  - Total depreciation = 45,751.31 + 93,206.48 = 138,957.79\n\n- However, for this balance sheet-style question, we also need to **subtract any sold fixed assets** (if any items previously capitalized were sold off), and add new purchases (if they are capitalized, as indicated by \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" txn).\n\n- In the data, we see purchase, sale, and depreciation events for \"Heavy Equipment\" (A/B/C/D etc.) but all inventory/stock/merchandise purchases and sales are not part of fixed assets. Only items labeled as asset purchases (with asset_name / asset_type in the corresponding fields) are to be counted in \"Fixed Assets\".\n\n**4. Final Calculation:**\n\nSo, **Fixed Assets End Value = Initial Value + Fixed Assets Purchases (non-inventory) − Depreciation − Fixed Assets Sold**\n\nBut, all direct fixed assets acquired in the period are:\n\n- Heavy Machinery4:          871,751.87\n- Industrial Facilities5:   1,046,775.17\n- Production Line Equipment6: 577,494.56\n  - *Sum*: 871,751.87 + 1,046,775.17 + 577,494.56 = **2,496,021.60**\n\nFrom the data, it does not appear that any \"fixed assets\" (those added in the asset_name/asset_type fields via FixedAsset type transactions) are sold during the period. All sales relate to bought/sold \"Heavy Equipment X\", which are merchandise/inventory, not recorded as \"Fixed Assets\" in the balance sheet sense.\n\nDepreciation deduction: Since the initial value of 8,000,000.00 and the subsequent purchases are of distinct types (the initial may represent assets not itemized in subsequent lines), and the new purchases occur during the period, the final value on the balance sheet will only be the sum of asset balances currently held (not already sold and after depreciation).\n\nBut since there's no explicit indication of fixed asset sales (from those acquired in the period), and no accumulated depreciation for those new items, we report the sum of \"Fixed Assets\" at end as the total of new asset purchases (since initial assets are netted out by sales/depreciation in this context).\n\n**Therefore:**\n- **Initial Value:** 8,000,000.00\n- **Final Value:** 2,496,021.60\n\n**Formatted Solution:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"2496021.60\"}}\n```",
