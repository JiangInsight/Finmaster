let's sum the \"bigger\" values:\n\n1335 x 2 = 2,670  \n1157.00  \n1085.80  \n996.80  \n729.80  \n658.60 x 2 = 1,317.20  \n587.40  \n509.81408357 x 2 = 1,019.62816714  \n331.81408357 x 8 = 2,654.51266856  \n242.81408357 x 2 = 485.62816714  \n149.65109344 x 6 = 897.90656064  \n98.25407760 x 9 = 884.2866984  \n9.25407760 x 2 = 18.5081552\n\nNow add all:\n\n2,670.00  \n+ 1,157.00 = 3,827.00  \n+ 1,085.80 = 4,912.80  \n+ 996.80 = 5,909.60  \n+ 729.80 = 6,639.40  \n+ 1,317.20 = 7,956.60  \n+ 587.40 = 8,544.00  \n+ 1,019.63 = 9,563.63\n+ 2,654.51 = 12,218.14\n+ 485.63 = 12,703.77\n+ 897.91 = 13,601.68\n+ 884.29 = 14,485.96\n+ 18.51 = 14,504.47\n\nSo, **total \"Interest Receivables\": 14,504.47**\n\n---\n\n### e) Other adjustments\n\n#### - Purchases of assets (not for resale, i.e., fixed asset purchases):\n\nAny \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" entries outside opening values are additional assets (so increases assets and thus increases liabilities + equity):\n\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 871,751.87\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 1,046,775.17\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase |   577,494.56\n\nTotal additional fixed asset purchases:\n871,751.87  \n+ 1,046,775.17 = 1,918,527.04  \n+ 577,494.56 = 2,496,021.60\n\n**So, add 2,496,021.60**\n\n---\n\n#### - All other pure asset purchases (inventory/raw material not yet sold):\n\nThese are assets, so their total value also increases Total assets (if not already expensed/sold).  \nBut in above, purchases are for resale and instant-sell listed as \"cost\" in the sales transaction (cost_amount).  \nSo, net effect in above calculations is correct already via the \"profit\" (sales minus cost), so we don't add purchase amounts again.\n\n---\n\n#### - Transfers and cash-bank movements\n\n\"Bank to cash\", \"cash to bank\", etc.: no net change to assets/liab/equity total (just moving between asset types).\n\n---\n\n#### - Inventory purchased but not yet sold\n\nThis would be those purchases at period end that are not reflected in a sales COGS yet (\"unsold inventory\" as asset).\nBut with the way \"cost_amount\" is specified per sale, and most \"purchase\" transactions do not accumulate separate inventory, unless there are purchases that have not been sold.\n\nBut let's check:\n\n1. At opening, fixed assets were 8,000,000.  \n2. Add subsequent fixed asset purchases: +2,496,021.60 (from above).\n3. All other \"purchase\" entries seem to be for (re)sale, with costs traced via COGS in sales records, so net effect is through the profit calc.\n\nBut Inventory at end = Opening inventory + purchases - COGS  \nBut considering the provided sales/profit computation, and as all purchase amounts match subsequent sales, we will not double-count.\n\nBut there is one PURCHASE left:  \nPurchase20231231011 | Purchase | ... | 1,000,000.00 | paid | UNPAID | Account Payable | S002 | Supplier2 | ... | 1,000,000.00 |\n\nThis means there is a purchase *unpaid* at period end: it creates an **account payable** liability, **AND** unsold inventory asset if not resold.\n\nBut we need to make sure we only count that as extra asset in total.\n\nSo, as this 1,000,000.00 appears on the last set of entries as a purchase **unpaid**, and there are no later sales of Heavy Equipment A for 2 units (only 1 sold on Sale20240122024, 1 on Sale20240124028, matching prior purchases), likely this purchase remains unsold in inventory at period end.\n\nThus, **add 1,000,000.00** to assets (and thus liabilities+equity). Because purchase is unpaid, so there is a matching account payable liability: the total calculation is still coherent.\n\n---\n\n### f) Sum up\n\nLet's combine everything:\n\nStarting total: **28,000,000.00**\n\n**INCREASES:**\n- Net profit after expenses, depreciation: 2,229,409.72\n- Interest income: 14,504.47\n- Additional fixed assets: 2,496,021.60\n- Inventory not yet sold (unpaid): 1,000,000.00\n\n**TOTAL =**  \n28,000,000.00  \n+ 2,229,409.72  \n= 30,229,409.72  \n+ 14,504.47  \n= 30,243,914.19  \n+ 2,496,021.60  \n= 32,739,935.79  \n+ 1,000,000.00  \n= **33,739,935.79**\n\n---\n\n**Quick double-check:**  \nAre there any asset decreases not yet covered?  \n- All expenses and depreciation are included in profit computation (already subtracted from sales).\n- Cash/bank/account transfers do not change total assets.\n- All purchased inventory either sold (cost already included) or unsold stock is accounted above.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answers:\n\n**Initial Value:** 28,000,000.00  \n**End Value:**   33,739,935.79\n\n---\n\n## Output format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"28000000.00\", \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"33739935.79\"} }\n```",
