Find the **initial value** of Accounts Payable\n\n- Review initial balances for any opening accounts payable.\n- Check all \"Initial...\" rows: There is no initial entry for “Accounts Payable”, so the initial value is **0.00**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify all transactions that INCREASE Accounts Payable (**Unpaid Purchases**)\n\nLook for all **purchases** with **Unpaid** or **Account Payable** or with payment status indicating the amount is unpaid.\n\n**Purchases**:\n- Only **Purchase20231231011** is marked as \"Unpaid\" and \"Account Payable\":\n    - amount = **1,000,000.0**\n    - S002 | Supplier 2 | P001 | Heavy Equipment A | 2.0 | 500,000.0 each\n\nAll other purchases are marked as **Paid**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Identify all transactions that DECREASE Accounts Payable (**Payments to suppliers** on previous payables)\n\n- Since **only one unpaid purchase** occurred in the period, check if any payment is made to **S002/Supplier 2** for P001.\n- For this period, there are **no subsequent payment transactions referencing payment to S002/Supplier 2** or any \"Paid\" status for this specific purchase.\n- So, the **full amount is still unpaid** at end of period.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Calculate final value\n\n- Initial Accounts Payable: **0.00**\n- Plus new payables: **+1,000,000.00**\n- Less payments (to reduce payables): **0.00**\n\n## 5. Double-check for any **other Unpaid Purchases**\n\nCheck all purchases for “Unpaid” or “Account Payable” status:\n\n- Only **Purchase20231231011** qualifies. All other purchases are paid.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Final Solution**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"1000000.00\"} }\n```",
