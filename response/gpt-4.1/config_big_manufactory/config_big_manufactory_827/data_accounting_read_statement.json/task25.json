These typically include:\n   - Selling Expenses (costs to secure customer orders)\n   - Cost of Goods Sold (costs to deliver goods/services)\n3. The standard practice is to extract both \"Selling Expenses\" and \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" but examples provided (like the one above) select only \"Selling Expenses\" in the 'solution', which match the \"costs incurred to secure customer orders,\" focusing on order acquisition costs.\n4. The expected answer, based on the example, is only the value of \"Selling Expenses\".\n\nTherefore:\n\n| Selling Expenses | 1468071.54 |\n\nSo, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"1468071.54\"} }\n```",
