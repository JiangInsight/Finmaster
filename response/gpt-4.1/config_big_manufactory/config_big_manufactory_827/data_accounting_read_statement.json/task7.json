The question asks for the value of \"expense in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income\", extracted based on balance sheet items.\n2. The most common direct expense-related item consistently updated in both the balance sheet and profit or loss is \"Accumulated Depreciation\".\n   - This is because depreciation is an expense, and its corresponding balance grows as expenses are recognized.\n3. Other possible direct expense links are not apparent (e.g., salaries payable, administrative expenses, etc., are not listed).\n4. In the table, the \"Accumulated Depreciation\" account starts from 0.00 on 2023-12-31 and rises to 138957.79 on 2024-02-05.\n5. This matches the pattern of expenses recognized over the period.\n\n**Therefore:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '138957.79'} }\n```",
