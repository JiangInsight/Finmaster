                        "content": "Let's break down the requirements step by step:\n\nYou are asked to extract three specific values from all the statements:\n\n1. Value of profit or loss for the period before deducting tax expense (i.e., \"Profit Before Tax\").\n2. The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period (i.e., increase in \"Accounts Payable\").\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares (i.e., \"Paid-in Capital\").\n\nThe final output should respect the financial statement grouping and original line item order from the input.\n\nNow, let's locate these three values:\n\n---\n\n**1. Paid-in Capital (from Balance Sheet):**\nLook for the \"Paid-in Capital\" line item in the balance sheet:\n| Paid-in Capital | 28000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 28000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\nSo, the capital contributed is: 28000000.00\n\n---\n\n**2. Profit before deducting tax (Income Statement):**\nLook for \"Profit Before Tax\" in the income statement:\n| Profit Before Tax | 2154033.87 | 2024-02-05 |\nSo, profit before tax is: 2154033.87\n\n---\n\n**3. Increase in Accounts Payable (Balance Sheet/Cash Flow):**\nLook for the increase in \"Accounts Payable\". The cash flow statement shows:\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 1000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\nSo, the increase is: 1000000.00\n\n---\n\nNow, assemble the answer in the desired order (Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement, then Cash Flow if needed), and following the mapping from examples:\n\nvalue1 = Paid-in Capital = \"28000000.00\"  \nvalue2 = Profit Before Tax = \"2154033.87\"  \nvalue3 = Increase in Accounts Payable = \"1000000.00\"  \n\n---\n\nFinal answer in required JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28000000.00', 'value2': '2154033.87', 'value3': '1000000.00'} }\n```",
