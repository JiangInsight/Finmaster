We'll follow that.\n\n   Correction: -13,358,400.82 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ -7.02\n\n   However, in your prior example, the result was shown to two decimals (\"-3.90\"), so the answer should be:\n\n   **Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -7.02** (rounded to two decimals)\n\n   The auto fill above says \"-0.74\", which would only be correct if you incorrectly divided by total assets, not liabilities.\n\n   Therefore, the corrected answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Gross Profit Margin\": \"27.47%\", \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-7.02\"} }\n```\n",
