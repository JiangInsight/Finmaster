Typically, this ratio is annualized. Since the income statement covers only about 1 month (36 days), to annualize:\n\n- Multiply numerator by (12 / number of months in the period)\n- Alternatively, if you report as is (for the period), just present the raw turnover.\n\n**Given that the example solution did NOT annualize for a one-month period, and was calculated for the reporting period, we use the unadjusted formula:**  \n\nSo:  \n\\[\n\\frac{18,062,437.45}{5,268,918.30} = 3.43\n\\]\n\nHowever, in the provided example, the AR at beginning was also 0, so it appears the solution ignores annualization (which would be necessary for comparability, but not requested here).  \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.43\"}}\n```",
