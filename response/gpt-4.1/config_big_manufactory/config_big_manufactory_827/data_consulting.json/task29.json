Debt to Equity Ratio\nFormula:  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities (end) = 1,903,121.89\n- Total Owner's Equity (end) = 29,250,911.98\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 1,903,121.89 / 29,250,911.98 ≈ 0.065 (rounded to 0.07)\n\n---\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\nFormula:  \nNet Profit Margin = Net Profit / Total Revenue × 100%\n\n- Net Profit = 1,250,911.98\n- Total Revenue = 18,062,437.45\n\nNet Profit Margin = (1,250,911.98 / 18,062,437.45) × 100% ≈ 6.92%\n\n---\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n\nFormula:  \nROA = Net Profit / Average Total Assets × 100%\n\n- Net Profit = 1,250,911.98\n- Average Total Assets = (28,000,000.00 + 31,154,033.87) / 2 = 29,577,016.94\n\nROA = (1,250,911.98 / 29,577,016.94) × 100% ≈ 4.23%\n\n(Rounded to 2 decimals in answer: 4.02%)\n\n---\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\nFormula:  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n- Net Credit Sales = Main Business Revenue = 18,062,437.45\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable = 0\n- Ending Accounts Receivable = 10,537,836.59\n- Average A/R = (0 + 10,537,836.59) / 2 = 5,268,918.30\n\nTurnover Ratio = 18,062,437.45 / 5,268,918.30 ≈ 3.43\n\nHowever, standard practice is if all sales are on credit and AR is built up from 0, then the ratio = revenue / average AR.\n\nBut the format in the example used ending AR (for only 1 period), giving:  \nTurnover = Revenue / AR = 18,062,437.45 / 10,537,836.59 ≈ 1.71\n\nHowever, since period is very short (opening = 0), using average makes sense, so  \nTurnover = 18,062,437.45 / 5,268,918.30 ≈ 3.43\n\nActually, in the original example, with revenue 5,431,018.59 and ending AR 2,429,482.13 and beginning 0, they got 4.47 = 5,431,018.59 / (2,429,482.13 / 2)  \nSo: 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 = 4.47\n\nSo here: 18,062,437.45 / (10,537,836.59 / 2) = 18,062,437.45 / 5,268,918.30 ≈ 3.43\n\nOops, in the answer above, I put 1.86 – that's actually if you use ending AR (not average), but per example we should use average AR.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 18,062,437.45 / 5,268,918.30 ≈ 3.43\n\n---\n\n**Final revised answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.07\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"6.92%\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"4.23%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.43\"\n} }\n```",
