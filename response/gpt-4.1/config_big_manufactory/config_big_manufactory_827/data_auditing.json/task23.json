Initial20231231001 (multiple lines: Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets)  \n- From the **invoice** field:\n    - \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Cash deposit, totaling $3000000.00.\"\n    - ... Bank deposit, totaling $5000000.00.\n    - ... Fixed Assets, totaling $5000000.00.\n- In the records, we see:\n    - Cash deposit: **recorded_amount** = 5000000.0 ← supposed to be 3000000.0 (invoice says 3000000.0)\n    - Bank deposit: **recorded_amount** = 15000000.0 ← supposed to be 5000000.0 (invoice says 5000000.0)\n    - Fixed Assets: **recorded_amount** = 8000000.0 ← supposed to be 5000000.0 (invoice says 5000000.0)\n- These are clearly mismatched:\n    - Cash deposit: recorded: 5,000,000.0, should be 3,000,000.0\n    - Bank deposit: recorded: 15,000,000.0, should be 5,000,000.0\n    - Fixed Assets: recorded: 8,000,000.0, should be 5,000,000.0\n\n#### 2. Interest20240105005\n- **invoice**: \"...On January 05, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Interest Receivables, totaling $996.80.\"\n- **recorded_date**: 2024-01-09. **invoice date**: January 5, 2024 (2024-01-05)\n- **recorded_amount**: 1079.25. **invoice amount**: 996.80\n- So, both amount and date do not match the regulated invoice value.\n\nThus, these are the detected inconsistencies, with for each:\n- Transaction ID\n- The field(s) mismatched\n- Recorded value(s)\n- \"Original\" (meaning: actual from invoice, as the more reliable source) value(s)\n",
