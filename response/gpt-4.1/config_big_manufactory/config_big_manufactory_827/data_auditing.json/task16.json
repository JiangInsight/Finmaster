The invoice (which is generally more reliable) cites $5,000,000 for cash deposit (but recorded as $5,000,000 in the first row; this is correct), $5,000,000 for bank deposit (but recorded as $15,000,000, which is inconsistent; should be $5,000,000), and $5,000,000 for fixed assets (but recorded as $8,000,000 instead of $5,000,000). The most reliable value per standardization is $5,000,000.\n- For `Expense20240117001`, the invoice says the amount should be $35,076.40 and status Paid, but the record says $41,286.06 and status Unpaid. Both fields are inconsistent. The best estimate for correct values are those in the invoice (amount: $35,076.40, status: Paid).\n\n_Note: Other entries are internally consistent or have insufficient data to contest 'invoice' values (value matches invoice, or the invoice value is used as reference). This is a list of all detected internal inconsistencies based on invoice information._",
