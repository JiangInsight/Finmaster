types. The standardized invoice (in the risk_issues) for each says:  \n   - Cash deposit: $5,000,000  \n   - Bank deposit: $15,000,000  \n   - Fixed Assets: $8,000,000  \n   The recorded amounts for Bank deposit (row 2) and Fixed Assets (row 3) are correct, but their \"id\" is the same as for the Cash deposit, so there is an internal mismatch - each distinct event should have its own id. The most reliable value is Cash deposit = $5,000,000, Bank deposit = $15,000,000, and Fixed Assets = $8,000,000 per invoice text.\n\n2. **Expense20240103001** (Sales Expenses, Jan 3):  \n   The \"recorded_preparer\" is missing (empty), but the invoice states, \"This transaction was prepared by Supervisor.\"  \n   Hence, fill \"Supervisor\" as Original Preparer, \"None\" as Recorded.\n\n3. **Expense20240125001** (Administrative Expenses, Jan 25):  \n   The \"recorded_preparer\" is missing (empty), but the invoice for the same id/amount/other fields says, \"This transaction was prepared by Staff.\"  \n   So, fill \"Staff\" as Original Preparer, \"None\" as Recorded.\n\nThese are the internal inconsistencies identifiable using the invoice as the reliable source and reconciling with the data fields row by row. Amounts, preparer, and mismatched categories with ids are all caught.",
