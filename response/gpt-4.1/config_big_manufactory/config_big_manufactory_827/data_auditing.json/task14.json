The payment_method...was bank transfer, and this transaction was paid.\"\n    - But the row shows `recorded_amount`: 1,000,000.0, `recorded_quantity`: 1.0, `recorded_payment/receipt_status`: Unpaid.\n    - These disagree with the invoice, which is most reliable.\n    - Correction: \n      - `Original quantity` should be 2.0 (invoice), `Recorded quantity` is 1.0 (row),\n      - `Original payment/receipt_status` should be Paid (invoice), `Recorded payment/receipt_status` is Unpaid (row),\n      - `Original amount` should be 2,000,000.0 (invoice), `Recorded amount` is 1,000,000.0 (row).\n\n- All other rows match between invoice and recorded fields or do not present contradictions in the provided data.\n\n*If there are multiple errors per row, you should group them per id and report all inconsistencies present for each erroneous record as above.*",
