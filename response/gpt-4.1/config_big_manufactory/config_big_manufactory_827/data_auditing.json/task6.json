According to the standardized (invoice) field, the cash deposit should be $5,000,000. The others (Bank deposit $15,000,000, Fixed Assets $8,000,000) thus have conflicted 'recorded_amount' and type; only one can be correct, likely the cash deposit at $5,000,000.\n2. **Purchase20231231001** – The recorded unit price ($911,514.54) does not match the correct unit price from the invoice ($800,000.0). \n3. **Sale rows for Heavy Equipment A** (e.g., Sale20240106004 and Sale20240124028) reference recorded cost per unit $500,000.0 (matches purchase cost) but the sale prices and profits must be checked for consistency.\n4. Additional possible mismatches exist where either a cost or price has changed in the sale versus original purchase (e.g., confusion between original and recorded amounts or mismatched invoice fields).\n5. No evidence of misalignment in date, payment method, quantity — only the stated issues warrant reporting here.\n\nOnly rows with direct field inconsistency between invoice and line-recorded values have been reported above, as per instruction and the example provided.
