\"recorded_amount\". The invoice only supports one set (category+amount) per id, so all but one must be wrong.\n- For \"Expense20240129001\" and \"Expense20240118001\", the actual (original) date is given in the invoice text and/or risk_issues column, which does not match the \"recorded_date\". Category/amount/other discrepancies are from the same id with different rows (these are replicated records that only one should match the invoice).\n- For all cases, the more reliable data (per instructions) is from the invoice and associated remarks/\"risk_issues\" field, while the inconsistent data appears in the main table columns.\n\nIf more inconsistencies are detected, iterate in the same way.",
