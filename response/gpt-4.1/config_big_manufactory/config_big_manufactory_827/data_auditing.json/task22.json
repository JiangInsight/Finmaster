For the `Initial20231231001` summary transaction, there are three entries with the same ID: \"Cash deposit\" (5,000,000), \"Bank deposit\" (15,000,000) and \"Fixed Assets\" (8,000,000). The invoice (\"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Cash deposit, totaling $5000000.00.\" etc.) strongly suggests that the category (recorded_type) and the amount per type as listed in the invoice are the reliable (original) values. Thus in the table, the same ID is misused to indicate three different categories, and the amounts are mismatched. The field values do not align with the reliable information in the invoice. \n\n   - One record for \"Cash deposit\" should have amount 5,000,000.\n   - \"Bank deposit\" should have amount 15,000,000 (not 5,000,000 as in table, so it's actually another error in the amounts).\n   - \"Fixed Assets\" should have amount 8,000,000 (not 5,000,000 or 15,000,000).\n\n2. For `Sale20240109009`, the invoice says: \"On January 09, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $2070499.57, totaling $2070499.57.\" However in the table, the `recorded_unit_price` is 1,690,132.81, the `recorded_date` is 2024-01-18, but the invoice date is 2024-01-09 and the price per unit should be 2,070,499.57, also reflected in the `recorded_amount`. So the `recorded_date` and `recorded_unit_price` are incorrect, and the invoice provides the best estimate.\n\nFor all other records in your sample, the fields are consistent with the invoice text.\n\nYou may extend the structure and logic if you find additional inconsistencies for other transactions by following this pattern.",
