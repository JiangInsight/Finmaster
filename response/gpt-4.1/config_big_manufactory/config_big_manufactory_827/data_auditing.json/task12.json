**Initial20231231001**: The same ID appears with 3 different \"recorded_type\"/\"recorded_amounts\" (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets). The sum is $28,000,000. This likely means that the single initial investment entry has been split into separate lines, which is a risk for double-counting or miscategorization.\n- **Transfer20240204001**: There are 2 rows with the same ID, one labeled \"Cash to bank transfer\" and one labeled \"Bank to cash transfer\" for the same amount and dateâ€”this is a contradiction, as only one transfer direction should be correct. Based on typical accounts flow and previous data patterns, compare with other transfer entries to confirm which movement is intended.\n- **Other transactions**: No internal inconsistency (fields line up with invoice and stated fields).\n- **Preparer/Approver field**: Where both are present, they appear correct per the invoice text. Only a risk if Approver or Preparer is missing and invoice says otherwise.\n\n**Note:** Many IDs repeat among Sales/Expense (e.g., multiple rows for same expense date but with different Prep/Approver, amount). This appears designed for line-item breakdown, so not an inconsistency unless an Approver is unexpectedly blank or contradictory versus the invoice. No such case is present in these rows (unlike the provided example with explicitly missing Approver). \n\n**If more specific issues found in other entries, follow the main structure above for reporting.**",
