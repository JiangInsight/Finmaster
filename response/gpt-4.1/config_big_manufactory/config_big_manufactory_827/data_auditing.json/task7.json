Initial20231231001 (Initial capital contribution inconsistency)\n- All three rows have the same `id` but record completely different transaction amounts and categories: Cash deposit ($5,000,000), Bank deposit ($15,000,000), Fixed Assets ($8,000,000).\n- The invoice field also separately confirms an invoice for each of those types and amounts with the same ID and date.\n- This suggests either:\n  - There is confusion and erroneous overlap in the recording of what comprises the initial capitalization (double-counting?).\n  - There should be three different IDs (one for cash, one for bank, one for assets) or the total capital should sum to $28,000,000 (but these are shown as distinct in description).\n- The inconsistency is in the recorded use of the same ID for three different, mutually-exclusive transactions, as confirmed by the invoice field.\n- **Best estimate**: Separate the IDs or clarify categorization, but as per invoice field, values are reliable but split should be reflected.\n\n#### 2. Interest20240204035 (Spelling inconsistency)\n- The \"recorded_receive_method\" is \"Interest receivable\", but the reliable \"invoice\" field and all other records use \"Interest receviable\" (with the typo).\n- Correction: The field \"recorded_receive_method\" should be \"Interest receviable\" to match the intended meaning and consistent typo across all other records.\n\n---\n\n*Only these two internal inconsistencies were apparent in the given table based on the stated logic. All purchase and sale unit prices, amounts, and descriptive fields match; \"Approver\" and \"Preparer\" variations are understandable within normal staff rotation. Only (1) the use of one ID for three different initial transactions and (2) the spelling mismatch in receive_method are 'internal inconsistencies or errors' per specification and example.*",
