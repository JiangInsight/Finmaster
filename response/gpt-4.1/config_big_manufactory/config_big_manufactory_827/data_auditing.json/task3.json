Initial20231231001\n- There are three entries with the same `id`:\n  - Type: Cash deposit, Amount: 5,000,000.0 (invoice matches the value)\n  - Type: Bank deposit, Amount: 15,000,000.0 (invoice matches the value)\n  - Type: Fixed Assets, Amount: 8,000,000.0 (invoice matches the value)\n- If each is an opening balance, with supporting invoice text, but all have the same ID, there is a problem: A single primary key **should not have multiple types/amounts in proper double-entry accounting (unless split clearly and mapped to sub-IDs)**. Here, the fields differ, but the invoice text always agrees with its lineâ€”but the `id` is the same, which is inconsistent.\n- Thus, for `Initial20231231001`, the **recorded_type** and **recorded_amount** do not consistently map to the invoice's authoritative data for that id: each entry should have a unique id or a consistent type/amount.\n\n### 2. Expense20240203001\n- Invoice says: \"On February 03, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sales Expenses, totaling $32201.46. The payment_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- The table, for this row, has `recorded_payment/receipt_status` as \"Unpaid\". Invoice text says \"Paid.\"\n- So the correct value (from invoice): Payment/receipt_status: Paid.\n- Similar problem is present as in the sample question/answer mapping.\n\n**NOTE:** Cases like Interest Receivable entries, where amounts differ but everything else is self-consistent with invoice, are not inconsistencies unless the amount and/or field values do not match their own invoice summaries!\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Main issues are multiple rows with the same id but conflicting type/amount (when ids should be unique per true transaction).\n- The only actual explicit internal contradiction (field-data error relative to authoritative invoice text) found is in `Expense20240203001`.\n\nIf any other similar errors (e.g., in payment status) exist, they follow the same pattern and should be handled analogously.",
