The task is to extract two specific values from the given cash flow statement:\n    - The amount of profit an entity retains after all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, have been deducted from total revenue. This is usually labeled as **Net Profit**.\n    - The cash payments made to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets. This is typically labeled as **Purchase of Fixed Assets**.\n\n2. We need to extract the values for:\n    - \"Net Profit\"\n    - \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\"\n\nLet's look for these line items in the statement:\n\n| Account                            | Amount         | Date       |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|------------|\n| Net Profit                         | 1842166.21    | 2024-02-05 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets            | 2670827.47    | 2024-02-05 |\n\nWe maintain the original order as shown in the input statement.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- value1 = '1842166.21'       (Net Profit)\n- value2 = '2670827.47'       (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1842166.21', 'value2': '2670827.47'} }\n```",
