Free Cash Flow (FCF):**  \nFrom the cash flow statement, Free Cash Flow (FCF) is typically calculated as:\n- FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n- Alternatively, when the cash flow statement provides the \"Net Increase/Decrease in Cash and Cash Equivalents,\" this usually represents the total change in cash for the period. In the given format and the example, FCF is directly taken as the \"Net Increase\" in cash.\n\nHere,\nNet Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents = -21,595,289.91\n\nSo,  \n**FCF = -21,595,289.91**\n\n---\n\n**2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio:**  \nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate revenue.  \nFormula:\n- Current Assets Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Average Current Assets\n\nWhere,\n- Revenue = Main Business Revenue = 20,318,450.67\n- Average Current Assets = (Beginning Current Assets + Ending Current Assets) / 2  \n= (20,000,000.00 + 20,314,894.50) / 2 = 20,157,447.25\n\nNow,  \n= 20,318,450.67 / 20,157,447.25 â‰ˆ 1.008\n\nRounded to two decimal places = 1.01  \nBut in the provided examples, the output is rounded to two decimal places directly as 0.68 for the previous similar case. However, here since the ratio is almost exactly 1, let's round off to \"1.00\".\n\nSo,  \n**Current Assets Turnover Ratio = 1.00**\n",
