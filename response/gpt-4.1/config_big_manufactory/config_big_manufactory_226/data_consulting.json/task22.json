Since \"Total Current Liabilities\" already capture all current payables/obligations, just sum as above.\n\nHowever, the problem may expect us to sum \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\", but with cash negative, the sum = -1,980,427.60 + 385,137.69 = -1,595,289.91 (matches Ending Balance in Cash flow statement; so the \"cash\" available is negative). Let's sum all quick assets:\n\nQuick Assets = (Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits) + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable  \n= -1,595,289.91 + 12,792,007.89 + 18,176.52  \n= 11,214,894.50\n\nQuick Ratio = 11,214,894.50 / 1,015,922.54 = 11.043\n\nBut double check with the example – in the example:\n- Quick Assets: (Ending Cash + Ending Bank + Interest Receivable + AR) / Current Liab\n\nFor this problem:\nQuick Assets = -1,595,289.91 + 18,176.52 + 12,792,007.89 = 11,214,894.50  \n(Inventory is not counted.)\n\nSo,\nQuick Ratio = 11,214,894.50 / 1,015,922.54 = 11.04\n\nBut the total current assets are 20,314,894.50 (from balance sheet), which includes inventory (9,100,000.00). Subtract inventory to get quick assets:\n20,314,894.50 - 9,100,000.00 = 11,214,894.50  \nSo, again, Quick Ratio = 11,214,894.50 / 1,015,922.54 = 11.04\n\n### Net Profit Margin\nNet Profit Margin = Net Profit / Total Revenue × 100%\n\n- Net Profit: 1,842,166.21\n- Total Revenue: 20,318,450.67\n\nNet Profit Margin = (1,842,166.21 / 20,318,450.67) × 100% = 9.07%\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer (rounded to two decimals):\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Quick Ratio\": \"11.04\", \"Net Profit Margin\": \"9.07%\"} }\n```\nBut in your detailed example (with similar size, no cash overdraft), you included cash as positive even if cash on hand was low (not negative). Here, perhaps we should just use the total quick assets (as above). \n\nIf you want the answer to two decimal places:\n\n- Quick Ratio: 11.04  \n- Net Profit Margin: 9.07%\n\nSo, the **final answer, formatted**:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Quick Ratio\": \"11.04\", \"Net Profit Margin\": \"9.07%\"} }\n```",
