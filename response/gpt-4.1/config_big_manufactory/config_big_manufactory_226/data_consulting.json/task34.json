Our ratio: 11,214,894.50/1,015,922.54 = 11.04, which seems plausible with the numbers.\n\n   **However**, sample included all current assets except inventory in the quick ratio, so our current process matches.\n\n5. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**  \n   = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities  \n   = -18,924,462.44 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ -18.63\n\n6. **Return on Equity (ROE)**  \n   = Net Profit / Average Total Equity  \n   Average Equity = (28,000,000 + 29,842,166.21) / 2 = 28,921,083.11  \n   ROE = 1,842,166.21 / 28,921,083.11 ≈ 0.0637 or 6.37% (sample used end equity in denominator, so 1,842,166.21/29,842,166.21 = 0.0618 or 6.18%)\n\n7. **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio**  \n   = Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n   Beginning = 0, Ending = 12,792,007.89, so Average = 6,396,003.95  \n   Turnover = 20,318,450.67 / 6,396,003.95 ≈ 3.18  \n   BUT: In sample, they used end AR for denominator (4.47 = 5,431,018.59 / 2,429,482.13), so  \n   20,318,450.67 / 12,792,007.89 ≈ 1.59\n\n**Thus, final answers align with above values.**",
