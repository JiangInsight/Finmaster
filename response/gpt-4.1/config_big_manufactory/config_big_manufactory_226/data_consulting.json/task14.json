Initial A/R = 0 means the ratio is based on first creation of A/R.\n\n   **However, looking at the provided exam example (in your prompt), with all beginning balances at zero, the solution used:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{A/R Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Net Sales}}{\\text{Ending A/R}}\n   \\]\n   For that example: 5,431,018.59 / 2,429,482.13 = 2.24, but \"4.47\" was the given answer (they must have used average), but with initial at zero, average is half of ending, so turnover is double. Let's follow the detailed calculation above.\n\n   Let's check both:\n   - \\(\\frac{\\text{Net Sales}}{\\text{Avg A/R}} = 3.18\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{\\text{Net Sales}}{\\text{Ending A/R}} = 1.59\\)\n\n   EXAMPLE CASE:  \n   For your given numbers, just as in the example, beginning A/R is zero, so average is half of ending. Since the example used the average, so we will keep to this method.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is approximately **3.18**.\n\nBut YOUR example gave a different (double) result than the direct average calculation, let's check that:\n\n**EXAMPLE:**\n- Net Sales = 5,431,018.59, Ending A/R: 2,429,482.13, Beginning: 0\n- Average A/R = 1,214,741.07\n- Turnover = 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.07 = **4.47** (which matches your sample answer!)\n\nBack to your problem:\n- Net Sales = 20,318,450.67, Ending A/R = 12,792,007.89, Average = 6,396,003.95\n- 20,318,450.67 / 6,396,003.95 = **3.18**\n\n**BUT triple-checking:**  \nThe mathematical calculation above is correct, and matches the sample's method.\n\n**Final solution:**  \n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.18\"} }\n```\n",
