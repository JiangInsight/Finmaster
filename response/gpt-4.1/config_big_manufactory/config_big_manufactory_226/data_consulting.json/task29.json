Debt to Equity Ratio\nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities (End) = 1,015,922.54\n- Total Owner's Equity (End) = 29,842,166.21\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 1,015,922.54 / 29,842,166.21 ≈ **0.03**\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Net Profit Margin\nNet Profit Margin = Net Profit / Total Revenue × 100%\n\n- Net Profit = 1,842,166.21\n- Total Revenue = 20,318,450.67\n\nNet Profit Margin = (1,842,166.21 / 20,318,450.67) × 100% ≈ **9.07%**\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\nROA = Net Profit / Average Total Assets × 100%\n\n- Beginning Total Assets = 28,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets = 30,858,088.75\n- Average Total Assets = (28,000,000.00 + 30,858,088.75) / 2 = 29,429,044.38\n\nROA = (1,842,166.21 / 29,429,044.38) × 100% ≈ **6.26%**\n\n*But to remain consistent with prior calculations and rounding, the more representative calculation using average assets (not just ending) gives ≈ 6.26%. But if you use ending only, it's (1,842,166.21/30,858,088.75)=5.97%. The sample in the original uses ending, so here I've used ending as well.*\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable: 0.00\n- Ending Accounts Receivable: 12,792,007.89\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0.00 + 12,792,007.89) / 2 = 6,396,003.95\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 20,318,450.67 / 6,396,003.95 ≈ **3.18**\n\nHowever, the samples use ending AR only (see example), which gives:\n\n20,318,450.67 / 12,792,007.89 ≈ **1.59**\n\nBut the typical formula is with average AR, so following standard calculation: **3.18**.\n\nBut in the provided example (above), they use ending AR (e.g., 5,431,018.59 / 2,429,482.13 = 2.24 is not used, instead, 5,431,018.59 / (2,429,482.13/2)=4.47).\n\nSo, according to sample, division should be by (Ending AR / 2), which is:\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 20,318,450.67 / (12,792,007.89 / 2) = 20,318,450.67 / 6,396,003.95 ≈ **3.18**\n\nBut the example divides by (Ending AR / 2). So the answer above is correct.\n\n**Correction:** In example, it divides by (Ending AR / 2), i.e., (Revenue) / (Ending AR / 2).\n\nLet's do that: 20,318,450.67 / (12,792,007.89 / 2) = 20,318,450.67 / 6,396,003.945 = **3.18**\n\nSo confirmed.\n\n**Final Answers:**\n\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.03\n- Net Profit Margin: 9.07%\n- ROA: 5.97%\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: 3.18\n\nSo, correcting above:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n  \"Net Profit Margin\": \"9.07%\",\n  \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"5.97%\",\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.18\"\n}}\n```",
