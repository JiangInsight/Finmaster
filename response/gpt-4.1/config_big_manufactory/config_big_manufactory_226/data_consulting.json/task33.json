Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n= Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities  \n= -18,924,462.44 / 1,015,922.54  \n≈ -18.63\n\n---\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nAssuming \"Debt\" means Total Current Liabilities (since there's no long-term liability):\n\n= Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities  \n= -18,924,462.44 / 1,015,922.54  \n≈ -18.63\n\n---\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n= Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  \n\n- Beginning Inventory (2023-12-31): 0  \n- Ending Inventory (2024-02-05): 9,100,000  \n- Average Inventory = (0 + 9,100,000) / 2 = 4,550,000  \n\n= 14,600,000 / 4,550,000  \n≈ 3.21\n\n**Correction:** Wait – Example showed using ending inventory only if only one period. However, for more accuracy, use average as above. But previous example used only ending. Let's use Average to be consistent with correct accounting.\n\n**But the example provided used only ending inventory (maybe because beginning inv was zero):**\n- If using ENDING inventory: 14,600,000 / 9,100,000 ≈ 1.61\n\n**Final:**  \n= 1.61\n\n---\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n= Total Liabilities / Owner's Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities (2024-02-05): 1,015,922.54  \n- Total Equity: 29,842,166.21  \n\n= 1,015,922.54 / 29,842,166.21  \n≈ 0.034 (rounded to 0.03)\n\n---\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio\n= (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities\n\n- Current Assets: 20,314,894.50\n- Inventories: 9,100,000  \n- Quick Assets: 20,314,894.50 - 9,100,000 = 11,214,894.50\n- Current Liabilities: 1,015,922.54\n\n= 11,214,894.50 / 1,015,922.54  \n≈ 11.04\n\n**BUT original examples calculated Quick Ratio as (Cash + Bank + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable)/Current Liabilities:**\n\n- Cash on Hand: -1,980,427.60\n- Bank: 385,137.69\n- Interest Receivable: 18,176.52\n- Accounts Receivable: 12,792,007.89\n- Total Quick Assets: -1,980,427.60 + 385,137.69 + 18,176.52 + 12,792,007.89 = 11,214,894.50\n\n= 11,214,894.50 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ 11.04\n\n**However, in the previous example, negative cash was added; let's use this value.**\n\nBut the provided solution above shows '1.54' for previous quick ratio where quick assets were 1226806.47, current liabilities 791550.92: 1226806.47/791550.92 = 1.54. Our approach is consistent.\n\n- So Quick Ratio ≈ 11.04\n\nBut the solution field says \"1.12\" — but that's not correct based on numbers.\n\nUpon review: Our calculation matches. Stick with our calculated figure (11.04).\n\n---\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n= Current Assets / Current Liabilities  \n= 20,314,894.50 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ 20.01\n\n---\n\n**Final JSON as calculated above.**  \nIf you want answers rounded to two decimals:\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio: '-18.63'  \nCash Flow to Debt Ratio: '-18.63'  \nInventory Turnover Ratio: '1.61'  \nDebt to Equity Ratio: '0.03'  \nQuick Ratio: '11.04'  \nCurrent Ratio: '20.01'\n\n---\n\nBut in my first output, I listed '1.12' for Quick Ratio, which is incorrect. So, correct final output (with proper calculation) is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n\"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-18.63\",\n\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-18.63\",\n\"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"1.61\",\n\"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n\"Quick Ratio\": \"11.04\",\n\"Current Ratio\": \"20.01\"\n} }\n```",
