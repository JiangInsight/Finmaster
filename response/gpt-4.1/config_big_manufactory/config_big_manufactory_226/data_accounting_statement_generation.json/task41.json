Identify Accounts Payable Transactions\n\nIn a cash flow statement, **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable** tracks the change in payables (amounts owed to suppliers for purchases **not yet paid**).\n\nHere, we need to find purchases that **are unpaid** as of the ending period.  \nBut in this dataset, **all purchases have payment status \"Paid\"**, with payment methods Cash or Bank Transfer, and sometimes cost_per_unit mentioned separately.  \n\nColumns in interest:  \n- type: 'Purchase'\n- payment/receipt_status: 'Paid' or 'Unpaid' (All are \"Paid\")\n- payment_method: (look for \"Account Payable\" or similar. Here, all are cash/bank transfer.)\n\nLet me check every \"Purchase\" transaction:\n- **Purchase20231231001**: Paid (Cash)\n- **Purchase20231231002**: Paid (Bank Transfer)\n- **Purchase20231231003**: Paid (Bank Transfer)\n- **Purchase20231231004**: Paid (Cash)\n- **Purchase20231231005**: Paid (Cash)\n- **Purchase20231231006**: Paid (Bank Transfer)\n- **Purchase20231231007**: Paid (Bank Transfer)\n- **Purchase20231231008**: Paid (Cash)\n- **Purchase20231231009**: Paid (Cash)\n- **Purchase20231231010**: Paid (Cash)\n- **Purchase20231231011**: Paid (Cash)\n- **Purchase20231231012**: Paid (Bank Transfer)\n- **Purchase20231231013**: Paid (Cash)\n- **Purchase20231231014**: Paid (Cash)\n\nAll **purchases are paid immediately** (either by Cash or Bank Transfer) â€“ there is no outstanding amount owed to suppliers.\n\n#### Additionally, check for \"Account Payable\" in payment_method or status:\n- All are \"Paid\".\n- None is \"Unpaid\", none paid via \"Account Payable\".\n\n### 2. Summary\n\n#### What does this mean?\n- Initial Accounts Payable (beginning of period) is **0** (no previous period data).\n- Purchases this period: **all paid**.\n- Ending Accounts Payable (end of period): **0**.\n- **Increase (Decrease) = Ending - Beginning = 0 - 0 = 0**\n\n### 3. Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"0.00\"}}\n```\n\nNo change in accounts payable since all purchases were settled immediately.",
