Definition: What are \"Current Liabilities\"?\nCurrent liabilities are obligations the company needs to pay within one year.  \nExamples:\n- Accounts payable (Purchase on account, unpaid bill)\n- Accrued expenses (unpaid interest, unpaid salaries, etc.)\n- Short-term loans, etc.\n\nFrom the data, the relevant transactions are usually those marked with `Unpaid` in the payment/receipt_status, most often for Purchases (\"Account Payable\") or Interest (unpaid interest is an accrued liability).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Step: Find Current Liabilities at \"Initial\"\nLook for any initial current liabilities balance from the initial entry (2023-12-31).\n\nCheck all transactions with type \"Initial...\" for any note of current liabilities.\n\n- | Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | ... | amount: 5,000,000\n- | Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | ... | amount: 15,000,000\n- | Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | ... | amount: 8,000,000\n\nNO balance sheet liabilities (e.g., no outstanding payables, no initial current liabilities account).  \n**So initial current liabilities = 0.00**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Step: Collect End-of-Period (Final) Current Liabilities\n\n### 3.1 Purchases: Is any purchase UNPAID (unpaid invoices)?  \nCheck each \"Purchase\" entry for \"Unpaid\" in `payment/receipt_status`.  \nIn this dataset, all Purchase entries (and Fixed Asset Purchase entries) are marked \"Paid\", so there is **NO Accounts Payable** at period end from purchases.\n\n### 3.2 Interest Payable (Accrued Liabilities)\n\nCheck for type: \"Interest Receivables\" where `payment/receipt_status = Unpaid`.\nWhile labelled \"Receivables\", in context these seem to be interest income to be received (not payable), as there is no indication they're company liabilities (their amounts are small and positive, suggesting income owed to the company).\n\n### 3.3 Is there any explicit unpaid expense item?  \nAll Expense entries are \"Paid\".\n\n### 3.4 Are there short-term loans or borrowed funds?\nNo bank borrowings, short-term loans, or similar liabilities appear.\n\n### 3.5 Any Other Unpaid Bills?  \nRe-check for any \"Unpaid\" with type \"Purchase\":\n- All \"Purchase\" are \"Paid\", not \"Unpaid\".\n\n### 3.6 Any evidence of \"unpaid\" for \"Purchase\", \"Expense\", or \"FixedAsset\"?\nNo. All have \"Paid\".\n\n#### Observations:\n- The only \"Unpaid\" items are \"Interest Receivables\" (which are asset, not liability, as they're money owed to the company).\n- Customer AR from sales are not liabilities; they are assets.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Conclusion:  \n- **Initial Current Liabilities:** 0.00  \n- **Final Current Liabilities:** 0.00\n\n---\n\n## 5. Final Format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"0.00\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Solution**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"0.00\"} }\n```",
