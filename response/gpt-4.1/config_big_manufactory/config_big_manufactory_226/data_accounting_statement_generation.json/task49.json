receivable/unpaid not collected in the period.\n    - Thus, actual cash on hand is calculated by netting the inflows (cash sales, bank/cash transfer ins) minus outflows (expenses, fixed assets, purchases, transfers out).\n\n    Since almost all purchases, fixed assets, and expenses are paid out of cash/bank, and given the massive inventory increase (all purchases of equipment), the company has negative ending cash (overdrawn) unless offset by financing (not shown).\n\n#### 2. **Inventory Increase (Purchases)**\n\n- **All purchases are inventory increases (Heavy Equipment)**\n    - Purchases: Sum all purchase amounts (from the problem: 3,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,600,000 + 1,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,600,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 3,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 3,000,000 + 1,000,000 + total line items)  \n    - The sum is **26,000,000**.\n\n#### 3. **Accounts Receivable**\n\n- **Unpaid sales**: Add up all sales with `Unpaid` or `Account Receivable`.\n- **Beginning A/R**: 0\n- **Ending A/R**: Sum of all unpaid sales = **14,785,507.44** (from sum of all `Unpaid` sale lines).\n\n#### 4. **Interest Receivable**\n\n- **Unpaid interest**: Add all `Unpaid` interest receivable lines.\n- **Interest Receivable Increase**: All of this is still receivable at period end = **12,804.85**\n\n#### 5. **Tax Payable**\n\n- **Increase in Tax Payable**: Sum all sales tax (tax_amount) minus all included VAT paid on purchases (if identifiable; here, only sales side is used, so it's the sum of all `tax_amount` from sales minus any explicit tax payments—which are not present).\n- **Total tax from sales**: 765,789.90\n\n#### 6. **Net Profit**\n\n- Sum of all profits in the sales transactions (profit column):\n    - Add up all lines in sales where profit is provided.\n    - **Total Net Profit:** 6,599,477.18\n\n#### 7. **Depreciation**\n\n- **Depreciation entries sum**: Only two: 45,745.80 and 81,887.42 → **127,633.22**\n\n#### 8. **Accounts Payable**\n\n- There is no indication of unpaid purchases/payables, all purchases are marked as 'Paid'.  \n- **Increase in Accounts Payable**: 0\n\n#### 9. **Fixed Assets Purchases**\n\n- Sum all Fixed Asset Purchase lines (1262568.05 + 1408259.42)\n    - **Total = 2,670,827.47**\n\n#### 10. **Ending Balance**\n\n- Calculated as: Beginning Cash (20,000,000) + Cash Inflows (Paid sales, bank-to-cash transfers) - Cash Outflows (Purchases, Expenses, Fixed Assets, Cash-to-bank transfers)\n- The large negative after purchases and expenses: **-159,968.11**\n\n#### 11. **Net Increase**\n\n- Ending balance minus beginning balance: **-20159968.11**\n\n---\n\n#### **Summary Table for Filling**:\n\n| Item                                            | Value              |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities             | 0.00               |\n| Net Profit                                      | 6,599,477.18       |\n| Depreciation                                    | 127,633.22         |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable      | -14,785,507.44     |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable      | -12,804.85         |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory                | -26,000,000.00     |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable         | 0.00               |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable              | 765,789.90         |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities         | -33,226,080.01     |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities             | 0.00               |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets                        | 2,670,827.47       |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities         | -2,670,827.47      |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents                       | 0.00               |\n| Beginning Balance                               | 20,000,000.00      |\n| Ending Balance                                 | -159,968.11        |\n| Net Increase                                   | -20,159,968.11     |\n\n**Note: All numbers rounded to two decimals as appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**If you need more details, or a calculation breakdown for any field, just ask!**",
