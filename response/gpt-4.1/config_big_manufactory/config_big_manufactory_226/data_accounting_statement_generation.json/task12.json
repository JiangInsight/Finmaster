Definition\n**Accounts Payable** on the balance sheet represents outstanding (unpaid) liabilities for purchases made on credit.  \n- Initial Value: Amount of unpaid purchases as of the starting date (here, 2023-12-31).\n- End Value: Amount of unpaid purchases as of the end date, after all purchase and payment activities.\n\n**Paid** purchases are not included in accounts payable—they have already been settled.\n**Unpaid** purchases (i.e., \"payment/receipt_status\" != \"Paid\" or \"payment_method\" = \"Account Payable\") are added to payables.\n\n## 2. Step-by-step Extraction\n\n### 2.1 Find all Purchase records (type = \"Purchase\"):\n\nLet’s extract all \"Purchase\" transaction lines and look at their \"payment/receipt_status\" and \"payment_method\":\nLet’s also check if any purchase was not paid (i.e., unpaid, on credit).\n\n#### All Purchases:\n\n| id                | type      | amount      | payment/receipt_status | payment_method   |\n|-------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------------|------------------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | Purchase | 1,500,000   | Paid                  | Cash             |\n| Purchase20231231002 | Purchase | 3,000,000   | Paid                  | Bank Transfer    |\n| Purchase20231231003 | Purchase | 1,600,000   | Paid                  | Bank Transfer    |\n| Purchase20231231004 | Purchase | 1,000,000   | Paid                  | Cash             |\n| Purchase20231231005 | Purchase | 1,000,000   | Paid                  | Cash             |\n| Purchase20231231006 | Purchase | 2,000,000   | Paid                  | Bank Transfer    |\n| Purchase20231231007 | Purchase | 2,000,000   | Paid                  | Bank Transfer    |\n| Purchase20231231008 | Purchase | 1,600,000   | Paid                  | Cash             |\n| Purchase20231231009 | Purchase | 1,000,000   | Paid                  | Cash             |\n| Purchase20231231010 | Purchase | 1,500,000   | Paid                  | Cash             |\n| Purchase20231231011 | Purchase |   500,000   | Paid                  | Cash             |\n| Purchase20231231012 | Purchase | 1,000,000   | Paid                  | Bank Transfer    |\n| Purchase20231231013 | Purchase | 3,000,000   | Paid                  | Cash             |\n| Purchase20231231014 | Purchase | 3,000,000   | Paid                  | Cash             |\n\n#### Check for Unpaid Purchases\nFrom the above, **all purchases** have status \"Paid\" and payment methods are \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" (i.e., not on credit).\n\n#### Purchases to Suppliers:\nAlthough there are several purchases from suppliers (see supplier_id, supplier_name), ALL are marked as \"Paid\".\n\n#### Any Purchase on Credit?  \nThere are **no purchases with \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Payable\" status** in the data.  \nTherefore, **Accounts Payable is always 0**.  \n\n### 2.2 Initial Value\nAt \"2023-12-31\", the only possible initial payables would be unpaid purchase balances up to and including that date.  \nBut all purchases at and before that date are \"Paid\".\n\n**Initial Value = 0.00**\n\n### 2.3 End Value\nAll purchases from 2023-12-31 and onward in the list are also fully \"Paid\".\n\nThere are NO outstanding in the supplier or purchase records at any date.\n\n**End Value = 0.00**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Final Solution (in the format requested):\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"0.00\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:\n- All purchases are fully paid (either by cash or bank transfer).\n- No purchases are unpaid (\"Unpaid\"), nor on account (\"Account Payable\").\n- So, Accounts Payable = 0 both initially and at the end.",
