                        "content": "Let's solve for the \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" in the cash flow statement.\n\n## 1. Identify \"Sales\" on \"Account Receivable\" during the period\n\nA. Find all **Sale** transactions where \"receive_method\" is \"Account Receviable\" or \"Unpaid\".\n\nExamining transaction rows, the following SALES are on accounts (i.e., AR increases):\n\n- Sale20240111008 | 749,601.75 | Account Receviable\n- Sale20240114011 | 1,332,686.65 | Account Receviable\n- Sale20240118016 | 2,156,466.82 | Account Receviable\n- Sale20240119018 | 668,808.14 | Account Receviable\n- Sale20240125022 | 674,830.39 | Account Receviable\n- Sale20240128026 | 707,188.94 | Account Receviable\n- Sale20240131029 | 1,417,458.33 | Account Receviable\n- Sale20240201031 | 1,999,604.61 | Account Receviable\n- Sale20240203034 | 2,028,402.09 | Account Receviable\n- Sale20240204037 | 1,056,960.17 | Account Receviable\n\n#### Also, notice some say just \"Unpaid\" but receive_method is the correct 'Account Receviable' field (spelling as per data) or sometimes blank for AR.\n\nHowever, in **this data**, it appears for AR they write explicitly \"Account Receviable\" in \"receive_method\". We'll only sum these.\n\nTotal AR Increases (sum):\n  =  749601.75  \n  + 1332686.65  \n  + 2156466.82  \n  + 668808.14  \n  + 674830.39  \n  + 707188.94  \n  + 1417458.33  \n  + 1999604.61  \n  + 2028402.09  \n  + 1056960.17\n\nLet's compute:\n\nStep by step:\n- 749,601.75\n- +1,332,686.65 → 2,082,288.40\n- +2,156,466.82 → 4,238,755.22\n- +668,808.14   → 4,907,563.36\n- +674,830.39   → 5,582,393.75\n- +707,188.94   → 6,289,582.69\n- +1,417,458.33 → 7,707,041.02\n- +1,999,604.61 → 9,706,645.63\n- +2,028,402.09 → 11,735,047.72\n- +1,056,960.17 → 12,792,007.89\n\nSo,\n**Total AR sales (increase): 12,792,007.89**\n\n-----\n\n## 2. Find \"Cash Receipts from Receivables\" (AR collections)\n\nHow much AR was collected? In supplied transactions, all sales with \"receive_method\" = \"Cash\" (or similar) are simple cash sales – those are NOT AR receipts.\n\nThere are **no explicit collections** from AR customers as receipts (i.e., \"Sale\" with \"receive_method\" = \"Cash\" and \"payment/receipt_status\" = \"Paid\" instead of just regular sales).\n\n**But that's okay** – because the typical calculation for \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" in the cash flow statement is:\n\n> Change in AR = AR at end of period - AR at start\n\nBut since clients are not providing AR balances, the standard indirect method (what's been used in example and context) is:\n\n> (Increase) Decrease in AR = Final AR balance - Initial AR balance\n\n### But with just transaction data, in cash flow statement, the \"change in AR\" (inflow is negative; increase is negative: cash outflow, decrease is positive) is:\n\n> (Increase) Decrease in AR = [AR at end] - [AR at start]\n\nBut if **AR opening and closing balances are not explicitly given**, you instead compute:\n\n> (Increase) Decrease in AR = Total AR increases from credit sales during the period\n>                          - (Total AR received/cash collections from customers for prior AR during the period)\n\nBut if there are **no explicit AR cash collections in the data (i.e., receipts from customers against prior periods' AR)**, then:\n\n> (Increase) Decrease in AR = + [Total AR increases from sales during the period]\n>                         = + 12,792,007.89\n\nBut that's an **increase** in AR, and so in the cash flow statement, this is a negative adjustment:\n\"**(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable: -12,792,007.89**\"\n\n### Double Check for Collections\n\nThere are no \"collection from receivables\" type transactions (like \"Receipt from customer\" that would decrease AR). All Sale \"Paid\" are directly cash sales, not reduction in AR.\n\n---\n\n# Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-12792007.89\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe accounts receivable increased by 12,792,007.89 due to credit sales on account during the period. No explicit customer collections on account (prior period AR) are recorded, so the entire amount is a net increase (outflow affecting operating cash flow negatively).",
