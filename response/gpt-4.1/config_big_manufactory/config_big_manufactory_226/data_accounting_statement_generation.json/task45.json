What counts as \"Investing Activities\"?\n\n**Investing Activities** generally involve:\n- Cash outflows for purchasing fixed assets (PPE, facilities, heavy equipment, etc.)\n- Cash inflows from selling fixed assets (not shown here)\n- Purchases of long-term investments (not shown here)\n- Receipts from sales of long-term investments (not shown here)\n\n**In this data set:**\n- Purchases of \"Heavy Equipment\", \"Fixed Assets Purchase\", \"Industrial Facilities\", \"Heavy Machinery\" qualify as cash outflows for investing activities.\n- Regular \"Purchase\" of goods for resale (\"inventory\") do not qualify unless equipment.\n\nBut in the provided data, most \"Purchase\" types seem to be for *heavy equipment*, i.e. long-term assets, so they count.\n\n## 2. Identify Relevant Transactions\n\nLet's extract **investing activity cash outflows**:\n\n| id                    | type                  | amount      | Details                            |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------|------------------------------------|\n| Initial20231231001    | Fixed Assets          | 8,000,000.00| Initial setup, not cash movement   |\n| Purchase20231231001   | Purchase              | 1,500,000.00| Heavy Equipment D (1x), Paid Cash  |\n| Purchase20231231002   | Purchase              | 3,000,000.00| Heavy Equipment D (2x), Paid Bank  |\n| Purchase20231231003   | Purchase              | 1,600,000.00| Heavy Equipment B (2x), Paid Bank  |\n| Purchase20231231004   | Purchase              | 1,000,000.00| Heavy Equipment C (1x), Paid Cash  |\n| Purchase20231231005   | Purchase              | 1,000,000.00| Heavy Equipment A (2x), Paid Cash  |\n| Purchase20231231006   | Purchase              | 2,000,000.00| Heavy Equipment C (2x), Paid Bank  |\n| Purchase20231231007   | Purchase              | 2,000,000.00| Heavy Equipment C (2x), Paid Bank  |\n| Purchase20231231008   | Purchase              | 1,600,000.00| Heavy Equipment B (2x), Paid Cash  |\n| Purchase20231231009   | Purchase              | 1,000,000.00| Heavy Equipment A (2x), Paid Cash  |\n| Purchase20231231010   | Purchase              | 1,500,000.00| Heavy Equipment D (1x), Paid Cash  |\n| Purchase20231231011   | Purchase              |   500,000.00| Heavy Equipment A (1x), Paid Cash  |\n| Purchase20231231012   | Purchase              | 1,000,000.00| Heavy Equipment A (2x), Paid Bank  |\n| Purchase20231231013   | Purchase              | 3,000,000.00| Heavy Equipment D (2x), Paid Cash  |\n| Purchase20231231014   | Purchase              | 3,000,000.00| Heavy Equipment D (2x), Paid Cash  |\n| FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 1,262,568.05| Heavy Machinery4, Paid Bank        |\n| FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 1,408,259.42| Industrial Facilities5, Paid Bank  |\n\n**Clarification:**\n- \"Initial\" asset bookings are not investing activities cash flows; they're opening balances.\n- Depreciation is NOT a cash flow.\n- \"Sale\" of equipment would be an inflow, but all Sales are customer sales, not asset disposals.\n\n## 3. Add up outflow amounts\n\nLet's list and sum the amounts:\n\n### Purchase transactions (all Paid, cash or bank transfer):\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 1,500,000.00\n- Purchase20231231002: 3,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231003: 1,600,000.00\n- Purchase20231231004: 1,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231005: 1,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231006: 2,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231007: 2,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231008: 1,600,000.00\n- Purchase20231231009: 1,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231010: 1,500,000.00\n- Purchase20231231011:   500,000.00\n- Purchase20231231012: 1,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231013: 3,000,000.00\n- Purchase20231231014: 3,000,000.00\n\n### Fixed assets purchases:\n\n- FixedAsset20231231001: 1,262,568.05\n- FixedAsset20231231001: 1,408,259.42\n\n---\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n1,500,000.00  \n+ 3,000,000.00  \n+ 1,600,000.00  \n+ 1,000,000.00  \n+ 1,000,000.00  \n+ 2,000,000.00  \n+ 2,000,000.00  \n+ 1,600,000.00  \n+ 1,000,000.00  \n+ 1,500,000.00  \n+   500,000.00  \n+ 1,000,000.00  \n+ 3,000,000.00  \n+ 3,000,000.00  \n+ 1,262,568.05  \n+ 1,408,259.42  \n\nLet's compute step by step:\n\nAfter 1st:        1,500,000.00  \n+ 2nd:           4,500,000.00  \n+ 3rd:           6,100,000.00  \n+ 4th:           7,100,000.00  \n+ 5th:           8,100,000.00  \n+ 6th:          10,100,000.00  \n+ 7th:          12,100,000.00  \n+ 8th:          13,700,000.00  \n+ 9th:          14,700,000.00  \n+10th:          16,200,000.00  \n+11th:          16,700,000.00  \n+12th:          17,700,000.00  \n+13th:          20,700,000.00  \n+14th:          23,700,000.00  \n+15th:          24,962,568.05  \n+16th:          26,370,827.47  \n\nSo, **total investing cash outflows = 26,370,827.47**\n\n## 4. Are there any inflows?\n\nLook for sales of equipment or fixed assets. But all \"Sale\" transactions are to customers of products, not of company assets, so no inflows.\n\n## 5. Final Calculation\n\nSo, **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities** = cash inflows - cash outflows = 0 - 26,370,827.47\n\n---\n\n## 6. Present in JSON format\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-26370827.47'} }\n```",
