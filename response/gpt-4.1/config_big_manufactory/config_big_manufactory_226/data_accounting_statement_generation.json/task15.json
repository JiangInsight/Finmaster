If \"Paid\", there is no liability.\n- **Interest Receivables**: Are assets, not liabilities, so DO NOT include.\n- **Expenses**: If \"Paid\", not a liability. If \"Unpaid\" (none found), would be a liability.\n- **Initial Balances**: Do not mention any starting liability, only assets.\n- **Transfers, Sales**: Not creating liabilities.\n- **Fixed Asset Purchases**: If \"Paid\", not a liability.\n- **Unpaid Sales**: Not liabilities, instead these are accounts receivable (assets).\n\n### **Step 2: Identify All Initial Liabilities**\n\nLook for any \"Initial...\" record mentioning a liability (there are none with that name; initial entries are all assets).\n\n**Initial Liabilities = 0**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identify All Final Liabilities**\n\nReview all purchases/expenses with \"Unpaid\" status (which indicates the value is yet to be paid).\n\n#### Let's search for such entries:\n\n- In the provided data, let's look for:\n    - Purchase.../Expense... rows.\n    - \"payment/receipt_status\" = \"Unpaid\".\n\nBut scrolling through, ALL purchase rows say \"Paid\". EVERY purchase row marks \"Paid\". \nAll expenses are also \"Paid\".  \nNo \"Unpaid\" expenses or purchases.\n\nNo explicit \"Borrowings\" or \"Long-term Liabilities\" present.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Double-Check for Any Overlooked Liabilities**\n\nRecheck:\n- If \"payment/receipt_status\" column for any record is \"Unpaid\" AND it's a PURCHASE or EXPENSE, include (none found).\n- Are there any other possible liabilities, such as loans? (None mentioned.)\n- No \"Loans\", \"Borrowings\", \"Notes Payable\" mentioned.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Compile the Results**\n\n- **Total Liabilities Initial Value:** 0.00 (from step 2)\n- **Total Liabilities End Value:** 0.00 (from step 3 and step 4)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Output in Required JSON Format**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"0.00\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n#### **Final Answer**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"0.00\"} }\n```",
