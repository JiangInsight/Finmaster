Definition & Scope\n\n**Cash flows from operating activities**: inflows and outflows of cash related to principal revenue-producing activities:\n- **Include:** Cash received from sales, cash paid for purchases of inventory/goods/services, cash paid for operating expenses (wages, rent, utilities, etc.), and cash paid for interest.\n- **Exclude:** Cash used to buy/sell fixed assets, interbank transfers, non-cash items (depreciation), changes in receivables/payables that are not settled in cash (unless specifically paid).\n\n**We use the direct method** (i.e. actual inflows and outflows).\n\n### Important Filters\n\n- Only transactions that are actually **paid/received in cash or bank** (i.e. \"Paid\" or \"Received\"), and exclude \"Unpaid\" or interbank transfers.\n- Fixed asset purchases **excluded** from operating activities (they're investing).\n- Interest Receivables UNPAID: Do not count (not received yet, so not cash flow).\n- Depreciation: Non-cash item—exclude.\n- Interbank transfers (Bank to cash etc): Internal, no net effect, **ignore** these.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Classify Transactions\n\nLet's process types from the data:\n\n### A. INFLOWS\n\n#### (i) Cash Sales (type: \"Sale\", payment_status: \"Paid\"):\n- Only consider amount for \"Paid\" sales (not \"Unpaid\"). \n- **Sum all \"Sale\" rows with \"Paid\".**\n\n#### (ii) Received Interest (no such row—interest is all \"Unpaid\", so excluded.)\n\n---\n\n### B. OUTFLOWS\n\n#### (i) Purchases Paid (type: \"Purchase\", payment_status: \"Paid\"):\n- **Include purchases for inventory/goods for resale.** Amount for \"Paid\" purchases.\n- But in this case, items seem to be \"Heavy Equipment\", i.e., fixed assets, i.e., probably **NOT operating cash outflow**. However, in the example, purchase of \"Chemical products\" (raw material) were included, but the \"Fixed Asset purchase\" was excluded (see prior solutions).\n- However, since all \"Purchase\" rows are for \"Heavy Equipment\", which seems to be fixed assets, **we EXCLUDE purchases of Heavy Equipment from operating activities** (they are investing activity!).\n\n#### (ii) Expenses Paid (Administrative, Sales, Financial):\n- Only include **\"Paid\"** entries.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Identify Relevant Transactions\n\nLet's filter the data as per above.\n\n### a. SALES (\"Paid\" only)\n\nLet's extract all \"Sale\" entries with \"Paid\" status:\n\n| id           | type | amount       | payment_status |   Payment/Receipt Method |\n|--------------|------|--------------|----------------|-------------------------|\n|Sale20240105004| Sale | 1463032.36   | Paid           | Cash                    |\n|Sale20240107006| Sale | 2159586.87   | Paid           | Cash                    |\n|Sale20240117015| Sale |1147555.96    | Paid           | Cash                    |\n|Sale20240121020| Sale | 664435.83    | Paid           | Cash                    |\n|Sale20240130027| Sale | 2091831.76   | Paid           | Cash                    |\n\n**Note:** Some \"Sale\" rows are \"Unpaid\" (and so remain open receivable—do not count for cash flow now, only when received).\n\nCount: Let's sum all the above \"amount\":\n\n- 1,463,032.36\n- 2,159,586.87\n- 1,147,555.96\n- 664,435.83\n- 2,091,831.76\n\n**Total cash inflow from sales =**\n= 1,463,032.36 + 2,159,586.87 + 1,147,555.96 + 664,435.83 + 2,091,831.76\n= **7,526,442.78**\n\n---\n\n### b.
