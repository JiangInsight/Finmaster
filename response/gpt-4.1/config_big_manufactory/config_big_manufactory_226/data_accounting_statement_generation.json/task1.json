Sales: Only counted if cash received.\n\nSales, according to the data, do not add to cash unless payment is marked explicitly as \"Cash\" received, which this particular data set does NOT seem to show (sales are mostly with empty \"payment_method\" and do not have an explicit \"cash received\" value). Also, in the sample solution from the user prompt, sales only increased cash if payment_method=\"Cash\". Here, this column is blank.\n\nAdditionally, the initial example **ignored all sales, unless payment_method was \"Cash\"**, which happens in that data, e.g. \"Cash\" payment_method or receive_method.\n\nIn our set, seems *all* sales are paid by \"blank\" payment_method, or are account receivable. So, sales cash inflow is **0**.\n\n#### Other outflows? None. All expense and purchase lines with paid and Cash just summed.\n\n## Step 4: Summing up transactions stepwise\n\n**Inflows:**\n- Initial cash: 5,000,000.00\n- Bank to cash transfers: 10,000,000.00\n\nTotal Inflow: **15,000,000.00**\n\n**Outflows:**\n- Purchases paid by cash: 12,600,000.00\n- Expenses paid by cash: 2,671,279.17\n- Cash to bank transfer: 5 x 1,000,000 = 5,000,000.00\n\nTotal Outflow: 12,600,000.00 + 2,671,279.17 + 5,000,000.00 = **20,271,279.17**\n\n## Step 5: Calculate End Value\n\n**Cash on Hand End Value = Total Inflow - Total Outflow**\n\n= 15,000,000.00 - 20,271,279.17  \n= -5,271,279.17\n\nThat would indicate NEGATIVE cash balance. This can't be, but let's check if we double-counted.\n\n### Reconciliation step - check for double-counted cash transfers\n\nThe risk is that a single transfer is (bad data design) appearing twice, once as bank to cash, once as cash to bank, when only one movement happened.\n\nBut, the data shows N \"Bank to cash transfer\" lines (that increase cash) and N \"Cash to bank transfer\" (that decrease cash). If each occurrence is a pair, netting to zero, we should only count the ones that affect cash.\n\nIn the sample solution, the \"Cash to bank transfer\" appears twice for the same transfer (see the sample), and only **one** counts for cash. That means, for each actual transfer, both a \"Bank to cash\" (increase) and a \"Cash to bank\" (decrease) row are there, but only the one with \"Cash to bank transfer\" in the \"type\", or more precisely, you only net them if present.\n\nSo, on our data, for each date, do both \"Bank to cash transfer\" and \"Cash to bank transfer\" happen? Let's check for the date 2024-01-30:\n\n- Transfer20240130001 | Bank to cash transfer | 2024-01-30 | 1,000,000\n- Transfer20240130001 | Cash to bank transfer | 2024-01-30 | 1,000,000\n\nAnd 2024-01-31:\n\n- Transfer20240131001 | Bank to cash transfer | 2024-01-31 | 1,000,000\n- Transfer20240131001 | Cash to bank transfer | 2024-01-31 | 1,000,000\n- Transfer20240131001 | Bank to cash transfer | 2024-01-31 | 1,000,000\n\nSo potentially, for each transfer, both sides recorded.\n\nTherefore, **to avoid double-counting, only count:\n- For inflows: Bank to cash transfer\n- For outflows: Cash to bank transfer**\n\nSum only N unique transfer IDs for each type.\n\n- For Bank to cash transfer:\n    - Transfer20240119001\n    - Transfer20240130001\n    - Transfer20240131001 (twice?)\n    - Transfer20240201001 (twice?)\n    - Transfer20240202001\n    - Transfer20240203001 (twice?)\n    - Transfer20240204001\n\nLet's walk date by date.\n\nFrom 2024-01-19 to 2024-02-05, explicit \"Bank to cash transfer\" and \"Cash to bank transfer\" appear for each date and transfer ID. For each date per transfer, only that pair.\n\nSo only add the amount if it appears as a \"Bank to cash transfer\" (inflow) and subtract for \"Cash to bank transfer\" (outflow). For example, on 2024-01-31:\n```\n| Transfer20240131001 | Bank to cash transfer | 2024-01-31 | 1000000.0\n| Transfer20240131001 | Cash to bank transfer | 2024-01-31 | 1000000.0\n```\nSo the net cash effect is ZERO. The cash came in from bank, then was sent back (or is a mirrored entry), so no net change.\n\n**Therefore, unless there are extra bank-to-cash or cash-to-bank transfers not balanced by their pair, net effect is zero!**\n\nBut, on Jan 19, only Bank-to-cash appears:\n\n| Transfer20240119001 | Bank to cash transfer | 2024-01-19 | 1000000.0\n\nIs there a matching cash-to-bank for 2024-01-19? No.\n\nOn Jan 19, only bank-to-cash: net +1,000,000 inflow.\n\nOn Jan 30:\n| Transfer20240130001 | Bank to cash | 1M\n| Transfer20240130001 | Cash to bank | 1M\n\nNet: zero effect.\n\nOn Jan 31:\n| Transfer20240131001 | Bank to cash | 1M\n| Transfer20240131001 | Cash to bank | 1M\n| Transfer20240131001 | Bank to cash | 1M\n\nWait, so two bank-to-cash, one cash-to-bank? Net +1,000,000.\n\nFeb 1:\n| Transfer20240201001 | Cash to bank | 1M\n| Transfer20240201001 | Bank to cash | 1M\n| Transfer20240201001 | Cash to bank | 1M\n\nTwo cash to bank outflows, and one bank to cash inflow: net -1,000,000\n\nFeb 2:\n| Transfer20240202001 | Cash to bank | 1M\n| Transfer20240202001 | Bank to cash | 1M\n\nNet: zero.\n\nFeb 3:\n| Transfer20240203001 | Bank to cash | 1M\n| Transfer20240203001 | Cash to bank | 1M\n| Transfer20240203001 | Bank to cash | 1M\n\nNet: +1,000,000\n\nFeb 4:\n| Transfer20240204001 | Bank to cash | 1M\n\nNo matching cash to bank out.\n\n**Let's sum up:**\n- Jan 19: +1,000,000\n- Jan 31: +2 x bank to cash, -1 x cash to bank --> +1,000,000\n- Feb 1: 1 x bank to cash, 2 x cash to bank --> net -1,000,000\n- Feb 3: 2 x bank to cash, 1 x cash to bank --> net +1,000,000\n- Feb 4: +1,000,000 (no matching cash to bank)\n\nFor other dates (Jan 30, Feb 2), the number of each matches, so net zero.\n\nSo, **net cash inflow from transfers:**  \nJan 19: +1,000,000  \nJan 31: +1,000,000  \nFeb 1: -1,000,000  \nFeb 3: +1,000,000  \nFeb 4: +1,000,000  \n**TOTAL: +3,000,000**\n\n## Step 6: Recalculate cash movement\n\n### Inflows:\n- Initial cash: +5,000,000\n- Bank-to-cash net transfer: +3,000,000\n\n### Outflows:\n- Purchases paid by cash: 12,600,000\n- Expenses paid by cash: 2,671,279.17\n\n- Cash-to-bank net transfers: Already covered above (not double-counted).\n\n### Outflows and inflows covered.\n\n## Step 7: FINAL calculation\n\n- CASH IN: 5,000,000 (initial) + 3,000,000 (net bank-to-cash transfers) = **8,000,000.00**\n- CASH OUT: 12,600,000 (purchases) + 2,671,279.17 (expenses) = **15,271,279.17**\n\n**ENDING CASH = 8,000,000.00 - 15,271,279.17 = -7,271,279.17**\n\nA negative balance suggests an error in the netting of cash transfers.\n\nLet’s check: Are all purchases immediately paid in cash? Maybe not. Let's verify all \"Purchase\" entries with Paid and payment_method \"Cash\":\n\nPurchases paid by cash:\nFrom above:\n- Purchase20231231001: Paid | Cash | 1,500,000.0\n- Purchase20231231004: Paid | Cash | 1,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231005: Paid | Cash | 1,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231008: Paid | Cash | 1,600,000.0\n- Purchase20231231009: Paid | Cash | 1,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231011: Paid | Cash | 500,000.0\n- Purchase20231231013: Paid | Cash | 3,000,000.0\n- Purchase20231231014: Paid | Cash | 3,000,000.0\n\nLet’s check, do any of these purchases \"double-count\"?\n\nCheck for unique purchase IDs:\n- 01, 04, 05, 08, 09, 11, 13, 14: all distinct IDs.\n\nSo, the total above seems correct.\n\n## Step 8: Review sales\n\nJust like the sample input, unless sales have payment_method \"Cash\", they do not affect cash. None listed.\n\n## Step 9: Final Answer\n\n### Initial cash on hand:\n**5,000,000.00**\n\n### Ending cash on hand:\n**8,000,000.00 IN**\nminus\n**15,271,279.17 OUT**\n=\n**-7,271,279.17**\n\nBut real cash can't be negative. Check: Did I double-count purchases or cash expenses? Is sample logic consistent?\n\nCheck initial example: Initial 3,000,000. Many expenses and cash outflows are less than 3,000,000, and end balance positive. Here, total outflows far exceed cash in.\n\nConfirm purchases and cash expenses: Are all paid immediately? Yes.\nSo, yes, the cash is spent faster than replenished from bank, thus negative.\n\n### Solution\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"-7271279.17\"} }\n```\n\n**Note:** The negative result indicates spending more cash than brought in, which may point to a mismatch between bank transfers and purchases/expenses in actual data or possibly missing cash inflows (e.g. from sales, if any portion paid in cash, not represented in \"payment_method\"). However, following the method in the examples and the rules, this is the correct calculation.",
