There are also many bank-to-cash/cash-to-bank transfers (with matching ins and outs, so they net to 0), except for the initial values. \n\n#### Let's run through the key impacts:\n\n##### a. **Purchases**: All purchases are fixed assets, not inventory (Heavy Equipment, Facilities, Machinery), and paid either from Cash or Bank.\n- Purchases (all paid):\n  - Heavy Equipment D: 1 (cash 1,500,000) + 2 (bank 3,000,000) + 1 (cash 1,500,000) + 2 (cash 3,000,000) = 1,500,000 + 3,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 3,000,000 = 9,000,000\n  - Heavy Equipment B: 2 (bank 1,600,000) + 2 (cash 1,600,000) = 3,200,000\n  - Heavy Equipment C: 1 (cash 1,000,000) + 2 (bank 2,000,000) + 2 (bank 2,000,000) = 5,000,000\n  - Heavy Equipment A: 2 (cash 1,000,000) + 2 (cash 1,000,000) + 1 (cash 500,000) + 2 (bank 1,000,000) = 3,500,000\n  - Fixed asset purchases: Bank transfers (Heavy Machinery4): 1,262,568.05; (Industrial Facilities5): 1,408,259.42\n\n**Total paid for fixed assets:**\n- Heavy Equipment D: 9,000,000\n- Heavy Equipment B: 3,200,000\n- Heavy Equipment C: 5,000,000\n- Heavy Equipment A: 3,500,000\n- Machinery & Facilities: 1,262,568.05 + 1,408,259.42 = 2,670,827.47\n- **Total purchases: 9M + 3.2M + 5M + 3.5M + 2.67082747M = 23,370,827.47**\n\n##### b. **Depreciation:**\n- Depreciation (sum all): 45,745.80 (Jan) + 81,887.42 (Feb) = 127,633.22 **Accumulated Depreciation**\n\n##### c. **Sales (assets sold) and cash receipts:**\n\n###### Identify all sales:\n- All sales are of assets by type and typically 1 unit each time.\n\n##### Let's calculate cash-in from sold assets:\n\n- Sales for cash:\n  - 2024-01-05: Sale P003 (Heavy Equipment C), amount: 1,463,032.36, cost: 1,000,000\n  - 2024-01-07: P004 (Heavy Equipment D), amt: 2,159,586.87, cost: 1,500,000\n  - 2024-01-17: P002 (Heavy Equipment B), amt: 1,147,555.96, cost: 800,000\n  - 2024-01-21: P001 (Heavy Equipment A), amt: 664,435.83, cost: 500,000\n  - 2024-01-30: P004 (Heavy Equipment D), amt: 2,091,831.76, cost: 1,500,000\n\n  (Look for unpaid/paid status—most sales indicate they are paid/unpaid via \"receive_method\", but some are definitely \"cash\", some \"account receivable\".)\n\n  **Total cash sales:**\n  - Where \"receive_method\" shows \"Cash\" or not specified but presumed cash:\n    - 2024-01-05 (P003): 1,463,032.36\n    - 2024-01-07 (P004): 2,159,586.87\n    - 2024-01-17 (P002): 1,147,555.96\n    - 2024-01-21 (P001): 664,435.83\n    - 2024-01-30 (P004): 2,091,831.76\n\n    - 2024-01-11 (P001 Heavy Equipment A), amt: 749,601.75, \"Unpaid\", \"Account Receivable\": So, NOT cash.\n\n  - All others where the \"receive_method\" is \"Account Receivable\" or \"Unpaid\" are added to AR, not to cash.\n\n  - **Total cash receipts from sales:** 1,463,032.36 + 2,159,586.87 + 1,147,555.96 + 664,435.83 + 2,091,831.76 = 7,526,442.78\n\n- **Cash on hand, starting:** 5,000,000\n- **Add all \"Bank to cash transfer\" & \"Cash to bank transfer\", which net to 0 unless initial balances or an imbalance (all transfer pairs are equal)**\n\n**Cash payments for purchases:** (from above cash and bank split)\n- Note: Purchases using Bank Transfer are from Bank Deposits.
