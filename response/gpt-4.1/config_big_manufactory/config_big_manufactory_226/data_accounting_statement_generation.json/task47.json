Thus, only for the cash ending, this matters. For \"cash and cash equivalents\" as a whole this is only relevant if we are not reporting them separately.\n\nBut since we start with both cash and bank together, and most incoming sales went directly to cash, also noting the bank to cash transfers, etc.\n\nLet’s count:\n- Transfer20240130001: 1,000,000.0 (cash to bank)\n- Transfer20240131001: 1,000,000.0 (cash to bank)\n- Transfer20240201001: 1,000,000.0 (cash to bank)\n- Transfer20240202001: 1,000,000.0 (cash to bank)\n- Transfer20240203001: 1,000,000.0 (cash to bank)\n\nSo let's count the \"cash to bank\" transfers, as outflows from cash, and the matching \"bank to cash\" transfers as inflows.\n\nFrom listings above, there are also \"bank to cash transfer\" entries, which are the reverse; they show up with the SAME amount as the cash to bank transfer. Usually such pairs mean net effect on \"cash and equivalents\" is 0.\n\nBut the quantities match up in pairs: for every \"bank to cash\" there's a \"cash to bank\". Sometimes these both occur on the same date (so they're a reversal; net movement is none). Therefore, on total cash AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, these movements cancel each other.\n\nTherefore, **no net change to total cash and cash equivalents** from these internal transfers; they're just movements between cash and bank.\n\n## 4. Sum Fixed Asset Bank Payments (these reduce cash and equivalents)\n\nFrom FixedAsset Purchases (which are \"Paid\" by Bank Transfer):\n- FixedAsset20231231001: 1,262,568.05 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n- FixedAsset20231231001: 1,408,259.42 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n\nTotal fixed asset bank payments: 1,262,568.05 + 1,408,259.42 = **2,670,827.47**\n\nBut note: These are made via **Bank Transfer**, so these don't affect cash, but do affect \"cash and cash equivalents\" as a whole (since the opening included both). So we must deduct these.\n\nSimilarly, purchases via Bank Transfer (see the Purchases section):\n\n- Purchase20231231002: 3,000,000.0 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231003: 1,600,000.0 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231006: 2,000,000.0 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231007: 2,000,000.0 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n- Purchase20231231012: 1,000,000.0 (Paid, Bank Transfer)\n\nTotal:  \n3,000,000.0  \n+ 1,600,000.0  \n+ 2,000,000.0  \n+ 2,000,000.0  \n+ 1,000,000.0  \n= **9,600,000.0**\n\n## 5. Summing Up\n\n### Opening cash and cash equivalents:\n20,000,000.0\n\n### Add inflows:\n- Cash inflows from sales: **7,526,442.78**\n- Bank to cash transfers: **9,000,000.0**\n\n### Deduct outflows:\n- Purchases by cash: **12,600,000.0**\n- Purchases by bank transfer: **9,600,000.0**\n- Fixed asset purchases by bank transfer: **2,670,827.47**\n- Cash expenses: **2,750,905.22**\n\n### Net Calculation\n\nAdd up inflows:\n- Total cash in: 20,000,000 (opening)  \n+ 7,526,442.78 (sales receipts)  \n+ 9,000,000.0 (bank-to-cash transfers)  \n= **36,526,442.78**\n\nDeduct outflows:\n- Purchases by cash:   -12,600,000.0\n- Purchases by bank:   -  9,600,000.0\n- Fixed asset bank:    -  2,670,827.47\n- Cash expenses paid:  -  2,750,905.22\n\nSum of outflows:\n12,600,000.0  \n+ 9,600,000.0  \n+ 2,670,827.47  \n+ 2,750,905.22  \n= **27,621,732.69**\n\n### Ending cash and cash equivalents\n\n36,526,442.78  \n-27,621,732.69  \n= **8,904,710.09**\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"8,904,710.09\"} }\n```",
