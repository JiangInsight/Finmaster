It's shown under equity on the balance sheet.\n2. **Where to Find:** Paid-in capital is commonly seen via \"Initial\" transactions in such data—commonly labeled as \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\", etc., at the company set-up.\n3. **Look at \"Initial\" Entries:**\n   - Cash deposit: 5,000,000.0  \n   - Bank deposit: 15,000,000.0  \n   - Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.0  \n   - All \"id\" = Initial20231231001, same transaction/investment event.\n\n4. **Sum These:**  \n   - 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 28,000,000.0\n\n5. **Other Transactions:**  \n   - Purchases, sales, expenses, depreciation, interest, etc., do **not** affect paid-in capital—they affect assets, liabilities, income, or retained earnings, not the paid-in capital line.\n   - There is no issuance of new shares or return of capital. No other \"Initial\" or capital increase/reduction events.\n\n6. **Final Value:**  \n   - Unless paid-in capital is increased (e.g., more share capital contributed) or reduced (shares bought back, etc.), it stays the same.\n\n**Therefore:**\n- Initial Value: 28,000,000.00\n- End Value: 28,000,000.00",
