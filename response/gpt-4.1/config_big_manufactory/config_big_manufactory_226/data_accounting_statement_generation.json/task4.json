                        "content": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n## Step 1: Initial Value\n\n- Look for initial accounts receivable in the initial records (type: \"Initial...\").\n- In the data, the initial deposits are: Cash, Bank, Fixed Assets. There is **no initial Accounts Receivable** given.\n- **So, Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00**\n\n## Step 2: Changes to Accounts Receivable\n\nAccounts Receivable is affected by:\n\n- **Increase**: Unpaid sales (\"Sale\" entries with payment/receipt_status: \"Unpaid\", and receive_method: Account Receivable or blank but clearly sales not yet collected)\n- **Decrease**: Receipts from customers related to previous account receivables (\"Sale\" entries with payment/receipt_status: \"Paid\" for previously unpaid sales). But in this dataset, all \"Sale\" entries that are \"Paid\" seem to be instant receipts (cash sales), so we do not track collection here (unless explicitly mentioned).\n\nLet's filter all \"Sale\" records with \"Unpaid\" status:\n\n1. **2024-01-11:** Sale to C013, Amount = 749601.75, Unpaid, Account Receivable  \n2. **2024-01-14:** Sale to C012, Amount = 1332686.65, Unpaid, Account Receivable  \n3. **2024-01-18:** Sale to C014, Amount = 2156466.82, Unpaid, Account Receivable  \n4. **2024-01-19:** Sale to C015, Amount = 668808.14, Unpaid, Account Receivable  \n5. **2024-01-25:** Sale to C017, Amount = 674830.39, Unpaid, Account Receivable  \n6. **2024-01-28:** Sale to C017, Amount = 707188.94, Unpaid, Account Receivable  \n7. **2024-01-31:** Sale to C014, Amount = 1417458.33, Unpaid, Account Receivable  \n8. **2024-02-01:** Sale to C005, Amount = 1999604.61, Unpaid, Account Receivable  \n9. **2024-02-03:** Sale to C011, Amount = 2028402.09, Unpaid, Account Receivable  \n10. **2024-02-04:** Sale to C008, Amount = 1056960.17, Unpaid, Account Receivable  \n\nLet's **sum** these up:\n\n| Date        | Customer | Amount      |  \n|-------------|----------|-------------|  \n| 2024-01-11  | C013     | 749,601.75  |  \n| 2024-01-14  | C012     | 1,332,686.65|  \n| 2024-01-18  | C014     | 2,156,466.82|  \n| 2024-01-19  | C015     | 668,808.14  |  \n| 2024-01-25  | C017     | 674,830.39  |  \n| 2024-01-28  | C017     | 707,188.94  |  \n| 2024-01-31  | C014     | 1,417,458.33|  \n| 2024-02-01  | C005     | 1,999,604.61|  \n| 2024-02-03  | C011     | 2,028,402.09|  \n| 2024-02-04  | C008     | 1,056,960.17|  \n\nNow, let's sum up these values.\n\n### Calculation:\n\n- 749,601.75\n- + 1,332,686.65\n- + 2,156,466.82\n- + 668,808.14\n- + 674,830.39\n- + 707,188.94\n- + 1,417,458.33\n- + 1,999,604.61\n- + 2,028,402.09\n- + 1,056,960.17\n\nSum step by step:\n\n1. 749,601.75 + 1,332,686.65 = 2,082,288.40  \n2. + 2,156,466.82 = 4,238,755.22  \n3. + 668,808.14 = 4,907,563.36  \n4. + 674,830.39 = 5,582,393.75  \n5. + 707,188.94 = 6,289,582.69  \n6. + 1,417,458.33 = 7,707,041.02  \n7. + 1,999,604.61 = 9,706,645.63  \n8. + 2,028,402.09 = 11,735,047.72  \n9. + 1,056,960.17 = **12,792,007.89**\n\n## Step 3: Receipts from Accounts Receivable\n\nAre there any \"Paid\" sales (cash collection) that are the result of customers paying off previous account receivable balances, i.e., reduce AR?  \nIn this dataset, all \"Paid\" sales seem to be new cash sales (no explicit mention of accounts receivable collections, or partial collections by customer). All \"Unpaid\" sales specifically say Account Receivable, but \"Paid\" ones either have \"Cash\" or blank receive_method.\n\nFor conservative calculation (and as per the example), we only count new unpaid sales.\n\n### **Thus,** the total **ending Accounts Receivable is 12,792,007.89**\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Present the Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Receivable End Value\": \"12792007.89\"} }\n```",
