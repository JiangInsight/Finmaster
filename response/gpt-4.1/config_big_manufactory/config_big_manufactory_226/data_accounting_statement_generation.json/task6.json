(All inventory purchases are on 2023-12-31 so, for initial, they haven’t yet been received.)\n\n**Initial Current Assets:**  \n- Cash: 5,000,000  \n- Bank deposit: 15,000,000  \n- **TOTAL: 20,000,000.00**\n\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: List Current Assets at the End (as of the last date, 2024-02-05)**\n\nLet's identify and sum up the components of current assets as of end:\n\n### **A. Cash + Bank Balances**\n\nThere are many cash-to-bank and bank-to-cash transfers throughout; transfers do not affect total current assets, only the composition between cash/bank.  \nWhat does affect: Cash reductions (for purchases/expenses) and cash inflow (from sales).\n\n#### a. **Starting point:**\n- Cash: 5,000,000\n- Bank: 15,000,000\n\n#### b. **Add Sales Receipts (cash increases), Subtract Purchases/Expenses (cash out)**\n\nLet's get a net inflow/outflow:\n\n**i. Purchases** *(all are paid - decrease cash/bank)*  \nAdd all 'Purchase' transactions where payment_method is \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" (all are Paid):\nWARNING: All purchases are on 2023-12-31, so the initial cash/bank balance already reflects them for the *ending* balance – but for initial, they are not included.  \nBut for current assets calculation, *inventory is a current asset*, so instead of subtracting paid purchases, we should add up the ending inventory value.\n\nBut Equipment purchases (all 'Heavy Equipment...') are likely long-term (non-current) assets, **NOT** current assets (inventory).  \n*Unless the company is in the business of trading heavy equipment (since many are sold within days), in which case, they're inventory*.\n\n**Check: The company is selling Heavy Equipment A/B/C/D rapidly (see sales lines), so it is trading inventory**.  \n**Thus, these are inventory, to be included as current assets.**\n\n#### **Thus: Purchases—Increase Inventory; Cost of Goods Sold—Decrease Inventory**\n\n#### B. Inventory Calculation\n\n- **Opening inventory:** 0 (as above)\n- **Plus Purchases:** All \"Purchase\" of Heavy Equipment (Paid or not), value is amount column.  \n- **Minus Cost of Goods Sold:** For each \"Sale\", subtract 'cost_amount' (the cost basis of items sold).\n- **Inventory at end = Opening + Purchases - Cost of Goods Sold**\n\nList all purchases (sum the \"amount\" for \"Purchase\" rows):\n\n| id               | amount      | product_name         |\n|------------------|-------------|---------------------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | 1,500,000 | Heavy Equipment D   |\n| Purchase20231231002 | 3,000,000 | Heavy Equipment D   |\n| Purchase20231231003 | 1,600,000 | Heavy Equipment B   |\n| Purchase20231231004 | 1,000,000 | Heavy Equipment C   |\n| Purchase20231231005 | 1,000,000 | Heavy Equipment A   |\n| Purchase20231231006 | 2,000,000 | Heavy Equipment C   |\n| Purchase20231231007 | 2,000,000 | Heavy Equipment C   |\n| Purchase20231231008 | 1,600,000 | Heavy Equipment B   |\n| Purchase20231231009 | 1,000,000 | Heavy Equipment A   |\n| Purchase20231231010 | 1,500,000 | Heavy Equipment D   |\n| Purchase20231231011 |   500,000 | Heavy Equipment A   |\n| Purchase20231231012 | 1,000,000 | Heavy Equipment A   |\n| Purchase20231231013 | 3,000,000 | Heavy Equipment D   |\n| Purchase20231231014 | 3,000,000 | Heavy Equipment D   |\n\nSum:\n1,500,000 +\n3,000,000 +\n1,600,000 +\n1,000,000 +\n1,000,000 +\n2,000,000 +\n2,000,000 +\n1,600,000 +\n1,000,000 +\n1,500,000 +\n  500,000 +\n1,000,000 +\n3,000,000 +\n3,000,000 = **26,200,000**\n\n**Thus, Purchases (Inventory In): 26,200,000**\n\n#### **Now, subtract Cost of Equipment Sold** (sum \"cost_amount\" column for all Sale rows):\n\nFind all cost_amounts from Sale lines:\n(Use only \"Sale\" rows; cost_amount is the cost of that sale).\n\n| sale date      | cost_amount  |\n|----------------|-------------|\n| 2024-01-05     | 1,000,000.0 |\n| 2024-01-07     | 1,500,000.0 |\n| 2024-01-11     |   500,000.0 |\n| 2024-01-14     | 1,000,000.0 |\n| 2024-01-17     |   800,000.0 |\n| 2024-01-18     | 1,500,000.0 |\n| 2024-01-19     |   500,000.0 |\n| 2024-01-21     |   500,000.0 |\n| 2024-01-25     |   500,000.0 |\n| 2024-01-28     |   500,000.0 |\n| 2024-01-30     | 1,500,000.0 |\n| 2024-01-31     | 1,000,000.0 |\n| 2024-02-01     | 1,500,000.0 |\n| 2024-02-03     | 1,500,000.0 |\n| 2024-02-04     |   800,000.0 |\n\nAdd up all these:\n\n1,000,000   (05-Jan)\n+1,500,000  (07-Jan)\n+  500,000  (11-Jan)\n+1,000,000  (14-Jan)\n+  800,000  (17-Jan)\n+1,500,000  (18-Jan)\n+  500,000  (19-Jan)\n+  500,000  (21-Jan)\n+  500,000  (25-Jan)\n+  500,000  (28-Jan)\n+1,500,000  (30-Jan)\n+1,000,000  (31-Jan)\n+1,500,000  (01-Feb)\n+1,500,000  (03-Feb)\n+  800,000  (04-Feb)\n\nSum sequentially:\n\n1,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 2,500,000\n+ 500,000 = 3,000,000\n+1,000,000 = 4,000,000\n+ 800,000 = 4,800,000\n+1,500,000 = 6,300,000\n+ 500,000 = 6,800,000\n+ 500,000 = 7,300,000\n+ 500,000 = 7,800,000\n+ 500,000 = 8,300,000\n+1,500,000 = 9,800,000\n+1,000,000 =10,800,000\n+1,500,000 =12,300,000\n+1,500,000 =13,800,000\n+ 800,000 =14,600,000\n\nWait, let's check: we had 15 sale events:\n\nLet's do in order, double check:\n\n- 2024-01-05 Sale20240105004: 1,000,000.0 \n- 2024-01-07 Sale20240107006: 1,500,000.0\n- 2024-01-11 Sale20240111008: 500,000.0\n- 2024-01-14 Sale20240114011: 1,000,000.0\n- 2024-01-17 Sale20240117015: 800,000.0\n- 2024-01-18 Sale20240118016: 1,500,000.0\n- 2024-01-19 Sale20240119018: 500,000.0\n- 2024-01-21 Sale20240121020: 500,000.0\n- 2024-01-25 Sale20240125022: 500,000.0\n- 2024-01-28 Sale20240128026: 500,000.0\n- 2024-01-30 Sale20240130027: 1,500,000.0\n- 2024-01-31 Sale20240131029: 1,000,000.0\n- 2024-02-01 Sale20240201031: 1,500,000.0\n- 2024-02-03 Sale20240203034: 1,500,000.0\n- 2024-02-04 Sale20240204037: 800,000.0\n\nNow summing:\n\n- 1 + 1.5 = 2.5\n- 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0\n- 3.0 + 1.0 = 4.0\n- 4.0 + 0.8 = 4.8\n- 4.8 + 1.5 = 6.3\n- 6.3 + 0.5 = 6.8\n- 6.8 + 0.5 = 7.3\n- 7.3 + 0.5 = 7.8\n- 7.8 + 0.5 = 8.3\n- 8.3 + 1.5 = 9.8\n- 9.8 + 1.0 = 10.8\n- 10.8 + 1.5 = 12.3\n- 12.3 + 1.5 = 13.8\n- 13.8 + 0.8 = 14.6\n\nSo, **cost of equipment sold = 14,600,000.0**\n\n#### **Thus, Inventory at end = 0 + 26,200,000 - 14,600,000 = 11,600,000.0**\n\n---\n\n### **C.

Do NOT count in current assets, but do reduce cash/bank.\n\n---\n\n### **G. Depreciation**\n\nDepreciation is a non-cash charge, so does not affect cash or current assets balance.\n\n---\n\n### **Total Cash + Bank Calculation**\n\nSet up equation:\n\n**Final Cash+Bank = Initial Cash+Bank + Cash Sales Receipts - Purchases - Expenses - Fixed Asset Purchases**\n\nBut purchases: Actually, the cash or bank outflow has already occurred (Paid purchases), but this is balanced by inventory being added (current asset). So, for current asset total, purchases are included under inventory, but also reduce cash. Since we are summing all assets components, this is handled.\n\nSimilarly, fixed asset purchases remove cash or bank, but only increase non-current assets.\n\nLet's attempt to get the cash/bank at end:\n\n- Initial Cash+Bank: 20,000,000.00\n- Plus: Cash sales inflows: +7,150,120.64\n- Minus: Purchases paid (total purchases) -26,200,000.00\n- Minus: Fixed asset purchases -1,262,568.05 -1,408,259.42 = -2,670,827.47\n- Minus: All Expenses Paid: -2,750,905.22\n\nWait—the purchases payment itemize to be included as paid outflows. To calculate cash at end:\n\n1. Starting cash/bank\n2. + inflows (sales receipts)\n3. - purchases (for inventory)\n4. - fixed asset purchases\n5. - expenses\n\nBut in current assets, the only difference is the makeup:\n- inventory exists (purchases not yet sold)\n- AR exists (sales made but not paid)\n- interest receivable\n- Cash+bank is the residue\n\nTherefore, a less error-prone way is:\n\n> **Total Current Assets at end** = (Cash + Bank) + AR + Inventory + Interest Receivables\n\nWhere:\n- Cash+Bank at end: **Initial + cash sales - paid outflows (purchases, expenses, fixed assets)**\n- Inventory at end: total purchases - total cost of goods sold\n- AR at end: sum of unpaid sales\n- Interest receivable at end: sum all \"Interest Receivables\"\n\nLet's now sum the outflows one by one.\n\n**Purchases (inventory): -26,200,000**\n\n**Purchases of \"Fixed Asset\" only:**\n- FixedAsset20231231001: 1,262,568.05\n- FixedAsset20231231001: 1,408,259.42\nSum: 2,670,827.47\n\nAll other purchases are inventory.\n\nThus, sum all \"Purchase\" amounts (already done above) as inventory purchases = 26,200,000\n\nSum all \"FixedAsset\" purchases: 2,670,827.47\n\nSum all \"Expense\" amounts: 2,750,905.22\n\nNow, for each sale, we only include the cash sales receipts as increases to cash/bank.\n\nLet's do the calculation:\n\n**Starting cash+bank:** 20,000,000\n- **Less purchases (inventory):** -26,200,000  (outflow for inventory added)\n- **Less fixed assets purchases:** -2,670,827.47\n- **Less expense payments:** -2,750,905.22\n+ **Add cash sales receipts:** +7,150,120.64\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nStart at 20,000,000  \n- 26,200,000 = -6,200,000  \n- 2,670,827.47 = -8,870,827.47  \n- 2,750,905.22 = -11,621,732.69  \n+ 7,150,120.64 = **-4,471,612.05**\n\nWait: Negative cash? That would indicate a mistake. But possibly, we have not added in the AR and Inventory into total current assets, which represent assets that absorbed the outflows.\n\nSo, **cash+bank at end** may properly be negative if the purchases+expenses+fixed asset purchases exceed the sum of initial + cash receipts.\n\nBut perhaps in real life, there would be some cash received from \"Unpaid\" ARs, but based on lines, cash sales receipts are only those with \"Paid\", so AR is total unpaid after_tax_amount.\n\nSo, **current assets at end:**\n\n- Cash+Bank: **-4,471,612.05**\n- AR: 12,152,407.49\n- Inventory: 11,600,000.00\n- Interest Receivable: 18,176.52\n\nSum total:\n\n-4,471,612.05  \n+ 12,152,407.49 = 7,680,795.44  \n+ 11,600,000.00 = 19,280,795.44  \n+    18,176.52 = 19,298,971.96\n\n**Total Current Assets at end: 19,298,971.96**\n\nLet's verify: initial 20,000,000.00, after many purchases, sales, payments, non-current purchases etc. So, it sounds reasonable.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Item                 | Initial      | End           |\n|----------------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Cash & Bank          |20,000,000.00 | -4,471,612.05 |\n| Accounts Receivable  |     0.00     |12,152,407.49  |\n| Inventories          |     0.00     |11,600,000.00  |\n| Interest Receivable  |     0.00     |   18,176.52   |\n| **Total**            |20,000,000.00 |19,298,971.96  |\n\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Assets Initial Value': '20000000.00', 'Total Current Assets End Value': '19298971.96'} }\n```",
