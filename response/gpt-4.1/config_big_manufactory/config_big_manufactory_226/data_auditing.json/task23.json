There is no internal inconsistency between type, date, and amount for these (i.e., cash/bank/fixed assets could sum up for initial capital).  \n- No error to report aside from potential for multiple rows sharing one ID, but as the invoice text supports the breakdown, there's no \"correction\" needed per your format.\n\n#### (4): Sale20240105004  \n- \"invoice\" says: On January 05, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $1,463,032.36, totaling $1,463,032.36. The cost amount for this transaction was $1,000,000.00, with tax $73,151.62, total due $1,389,880.74.  \n- Recorded_date is \"2024-01-13\" instead of \"2024-01-05\"; recorded_amount is 1,744,908.19 instead of 1,463,032.36.  \n- So, the correct date and amount (as per invoice) are 2024-01-05 and 1,463,032.36.\n\n- All other fields (quantity, unit price, etc) match invoice.\n\nOther entries:  \n- All Purchases, Expenses, Interests, Transfers, and other Sales records are internally consistent with their invoices, with no conflicts or mismatches between recorded values and text evidence EXCEPT the above noted instance.\n\n**Hence, only one true mismatch, Sale20240105004.**  \n- (And, for others, all fields check out or are not corroborated by the invoice at greater specificity.)\n\n#### JSON formatting  \n- The only non-compliance is (for Sale20240105004; and for illustrative purposes, the sample includes the first three fully as \"no error\").  \n- If only errors should be listed, only Sale20240105004 would be included.  \n- However, per your example, you include everything, so the above is used.\n\nIf you want *only* discrepancies, then:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n  \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\",\n  \"Original date\": \"2024-01-05\",\n  \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-13\",\n  \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n  \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n  \"Original payment_method\": \"Cash\",\n  \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n  \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\",\n  \"Recorded quantity\": \"1.0\",\n  \"Original price\": \"1463032.36\",\n  \"Recorded price\": \"1463032.36\",\n  \"Original receive_method\": \"Cash\",\n  \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Cash\",\n  \"Original amount\": \"1463032.36\",\n  \"Recorded amount\": \"1744908.19\",\n  \"Original tax\": \"73151.62\",\n  \"Recorded tax\": \"73151.62\",\n  \"Original profit\": \"463032.36\",\n  \"Recorded profit\": \"463032.36\",\n  \"Original Preparer\": null,\n  \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n  \"Original Approver\": null,\n  \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n  \"id\": \"Sale20240105004\"\n}}\n```\n\nIf you need ALL rows, including non-errors, use the longer version above. If just errors, use the short.",
