Initial20231231001 entries (Cash deposit; Bank deposit; Fixed Assets):**\n- In the first problem row we see three lines all with the same id \"Initial20231231001\" but three different types and amounts, all referenced by their splits in the invoice. In this dataset, the splits are correct as per the invoice; the only \"inconsistency\" is the repeated `id` with three different categories (type field). In practice, this is a deposit split which is not a true \"internal inconsistency\" given that the invoice matches, but in other software these may be flagged as incorrectly split, so marked for completeness.\n\n**4. Sale20240204037 (profit field):**\n- According to the risk_issues attached, the \"Original profit\" per calculation is 256,960.17 but the \"Recorded profit\" is 243,768.08. Thus, the profit field was internally inconsistentâ€”this is confirmed as a posting or calculation error.\n- All other fields for this record are correct per invoice.\n\n**No other internal inconsistencies** within the recorded rows were found in this sample based on a row-vs-invoice cross-check, except as shown. Most entries agree (amount=unit price*quantity, cost matches, etc) and no other calculation errors or transposition errors are visible.
