Initial20231231001 (Opening Balances)\nThis transaction appears three times for three different sub-components (\"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\"), all on the same date and with different recorded amounts: 5,000,000; 15,000,000; 8,000,000. However, adding these up gives 28,000,000, while standard opening entries would keep the sum constant. However, according to the invoice text of each entry, and considering usual opening entry practice, it is typically a single entry, split among cash, bank, and fixed assets, summing up to a total opening balance. Still, the amounts in the invoice and the row (\"totaling $5,000,000\", \"$15,000,000\", \"$8,000,000\") do not sum up to an obvious consistent total, and with identical IDs this is likely an entry split (possibly incorrectly). \nThe most likely intended total for this opening is $20,000,000 (as the sum of \"Cash deposit\" $5,000,000 and \"Bank deposit\" $15,000,000), and the fixed assets $8,000,000 seems redundant or a duplicate (perhaps a mis-entry). Considering standard practices and the more reliable \"invoice\" field, either the sum should be $5m cash + $15m bank = $20m, or fixed assets may be part of the original capital. At the very least, the amount of $8,000,000 for fixed assets seems to overlap or is not balanced correctly.\n\nThus, there is an error in how the opening balances are split or duplicated. The best estimate is a **missing or duplicate entry**, with a likely intended sum of $20,000,000. All other fields are blank as expected.\n\n### 2. Sale20240128026 (Zero Quantity Sale)\nIn this row:\n- quantity: 0.0\n- unit price: 707,188.94\n- amount: 0.0\n- invoice: \"consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $707188.94, totaling $707188.94.\"\n- rest of sale fields (tax, cost, profit, receive method) are internally consistent with a transaction of 1 unit, not 0.\n\nThis indicates an internal data entry error: **quantity** is 0 (recorded), but invoice and amount/other calculations expect 1.\n- The recorded amount should be 1.0 × 707,188.94 = 707,188.94\n- The correct quantity is 1.0\n\nThus, correction: original quantity should be 1.0, and original amount should be 707,188.94.\n\n---\n\nAll other entries are internally consistent or do not present internal value mismatches between recorded and invoice/other fields. All key Sale/Purchase rows match their associated invoice details for core fields. \n\nSummary: \n- Initial opening entry has category/amount splitting errors (likely mishandled multi-entry).\n- Sale20240128026 has the classic \"quantity=0 but amount/unit, tax, and invoice show 1\".\n\nIf only one answer is expected, it’s the zero-quantity sale, but the opening entry is a plausible bookkeeping error as well.\n```",
