The invoice, which is considered the most reliable field, states for each corresponding type and total:\n    - \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Cash deposit, totaling $5000000.00.\"\n    - \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Bank deposit, totaling $15000000.00.\"\n    - \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Fixed Assets, totaling $8000000.00.\"\n- In the provided (problem) transaction row with type \"Cash deposit\" and amount \"5000000.0\", the \"recorded_amount\" field is incorrectly recorded as \"15000000.0\" (taken from the \"Bank deposit\" entry), while in the actual invoice narrative it should match \"5000000.0\".\n- **Thus, the key inconsistency is in the \"recorded_amount\" field for the Cash deposit line.** The original (true, per invoice) amount is $5,000,000, but the recorded field shows $15,000,000 in this row.\n- No other fields such as quantity, price, method, etc., are applicable for deposit transactions.\n- Therefore, `Original amount` should be $5,000,000 and `Recorded amount` (erroneously entered) is $15,000,000. \n\n(If you wish to explore other rows with other types for the same id, similar logic applies, but only the relevant row for the inconsistency described above is provided in this solution.)\n",
