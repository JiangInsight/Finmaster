Therefore:\n    - The **Original category** should be \"Interest Receivables\", but **Recorded category** is \"Administrative Expenses\".\n    - All other fields are consistent or not directly addressable from the invoice, but for completeness, following the format, they are set to `null` if not relevant or not verifiable from invoice text. The receive_method is almost correct but the only difference is the small 'a' vs. 'A' typo in \"receivable\", otherwise it matches and is the same in both.\n\n**No other inconsistencies are found in the provided rows based on the invoice field and other tracked columns.** If you need only the discrepancy summary (not the redundant fields), let me know.",
