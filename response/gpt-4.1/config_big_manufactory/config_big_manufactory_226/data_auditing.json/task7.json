Reliable invoice narration says \"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Cash deposit, totaling $5000000.00\", which means the other entries are likely incorrect for this `id`. \n    - Best estimate: For `Initial20231231001`, the correct type is \"Cash deposit\", correct amount is \"5000000.0\"; \"Bank deposit\" should be under a separate id or as a separate entry.\n    - For the entries with \"Bank deposit\" 15,000,000.0 and \"Fixed Asset\" 8,000,000.0, the cross-use of one id and conflicting narration means the extra rows are likely erroneous. All are included above to document the conflicting records.\n\n2. **Sale20240107006**\n    - `recorded_receive_method` is \"Interest receivable\" but invoice and context indicate the payment was made in \"Cash\" and status is \"Paid\".\n    - Best estimate: The correct `receive_method` is \"Cash\" (the value in the narration), not \"Interest receivable\".\n\nNo other inconsistencies are apparent within a record, and further inconsistencies such as in approving/preparing staff's name differences are not present for exact ids in this selection (some difference in names occur for the same invoice group, but not the same id; the provided example rows all agree for each id in payment/amount/unit etc). \n\nThe interest receivable spelling (\"interest receviable\" vs \"interest receivable\") matches the invoice description and is consistent in the data.\n\nIf more errors are desired (e.g., missing preparer/approver or amounts), please specify if you want harder checks (e.g. duplicated multi-rows, or missing staff, but these do not show obvious contradictions row-wise in this selection).",
