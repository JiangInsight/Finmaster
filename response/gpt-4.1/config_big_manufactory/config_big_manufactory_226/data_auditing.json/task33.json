According to invoice text, these are initial entries to set up balances for cash, bank, and fixed assets. The totals and values correspond, but the category 'Initial' is implied by the invoice, while the recorded type field splits them.\n   - Fields with \"category\" == \"Initial\" (from the nature of the transaction/invoice) are split in the records as assets and cash/bank, but the amount matches.\n\n2. **Sale20240118016** – The invoice states that this is a \"Sale\", consisting of 1.0 units at unit price $2,156,466.82, total $2,156,466.82. Tax: $107,823.34, total amount after tax $2,048,643.48. Cost $1,500,000, profit $656,466.82.\n   - Recorded as type \"Financial Expenses\", date \"2024-01-21\", amount \"2,331,492.32\", unit price \"2,102,880.03\", tax \"2,218,376.18\" (which is absurdly too high for tax), etc.\n   - The recorded fields do not align at all with the invoice, which is clear, specific, and internally consistent.\n   - Therefore, multiple fields are wrong: type/category, date, unit price, amount, tax.\n\nFor the rest of the entries in the provided data, there are no direct mismatches between the recorded values and the invoice narrative for units, unit price, totals, payment method, preparer/approver, etc. The pattern in the sample and problem is to only list items where an \"original\" value can confidently be estimated from the invoice, but the record mismatches.\n\nIf more items needed to be listed (e.g. minor mismatches), we could continue, but these are the only two clear cases of material inconsistency given the data. If more are expected, please clarify which types of fields to extract.\n\n**Note:** If you would like a separate entry for each field when multiple fields are wrong (e.g. in Sale20240118016), let me know; for brevity, I grouped them under one dictionary for that row, as in your example.",
