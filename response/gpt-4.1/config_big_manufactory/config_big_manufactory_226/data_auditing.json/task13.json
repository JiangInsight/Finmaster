The recorded tax is vastly overstated (1.7 million instead of 99,980.23).\n- All other fields, including amount, price, etc. match or are not contradicted by the invoice.\n\nThus, only these fields are inconsistent; other fields are correctly recorded or not specified.\n\nNo date, payment/receipt_status, payment_method, quantity, price, receive_method, Preparer, or Approver mismatch is evident.\n\n**So the solution is exactly as above.**",
