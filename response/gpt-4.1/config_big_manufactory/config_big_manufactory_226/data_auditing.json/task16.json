Most Expenses match.\n- The entries at the start (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) have matching values between description and recorded fields, even if repeated under the same id: each just reflects a different 'type' of asset but all are consistent with description.\n- Only the example discrepancy is present in this dataset. No other line shows a mismatch between description ('invoice') and the recorded fields.\n\n**If you need only the inconsistencies (not all lines), just using the last JSON object is enough.**",
