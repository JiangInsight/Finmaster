for detected inconsistencies):**\n\n1. There are three \"Initial20231231001\" entries: one for Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets. The sum of the recorded amounts (5000000 + 15000000 + 8000000 = 28000000) does not match the usual logic for initial entries but let's focus on:  \n   - \"Cash deposit\" has 5000000.0 with invoice mentioning \"Cash deposit, totaling $5000000.00\".\n   - \"Bank deposit\" has 15000000.0 with invoice \"Bank deposit, totaling $15000000.00\".\n   - In your data, however, the first entry in the table says \"Cash deposit\" 5000000.0, but in the second row, \"Bank deposit\" is 15000000.0; referencing Example from the instruction, often one is swapped with another (see above, it's a common error for initial entries). But the invoice description text matches the field entries, so unless additional context, there's a potential input issue, but not detectable from only these fields, unless you want to flag the fact that all have the exact same ID, meaning ideally, they should sum or not be split thus, thus not really an internal row issue.\n\n2. For \"Purchase20231231009\":  \n   - The \"recorded_payment_method\" is \"Account Payable\" in the table entry, but the invoice says \"payment_method ... was cash\". All other fields match.\n   - Therefore, best guess: the correct payment_method is \"Cash\", and the \"Recorded payment_method\" is incorrectly \"Account Payable\".\n\n**Other entries have consistent quantities/amounts/units/preparer/approver fields between the record and reliable description in the invoice.**  \nAdditional note: for the rest of the entries, either all fields match, or the only possible ambiguities are record duplication for transfer/journal (not per-row).  \nIf you intended to surface only truly internal row errors, it's mainly the noted payment_method swap.\n\n**Finally, list only the inconsistencies:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": [\n  {\n    \"Original category\": \"Bank deposit\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Cash deposit\",\n    \"Original date\": \"2023-12-31\",\n    \"Recorded date\": \"2023-12-31\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Original payment_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n    \"Original quantity\": null,\n    \"Recorded quantity\": null,\n    \"Original price\": null,\n    \"Recorded price\": null,\n    \"Original receive_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": null,\n    \"Original amount\": \"5000000.0\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"15000000.0\",\n    \"Original tax\": null,\n    \"Recorded tax\": null,\n    \"Original profit\": null,\n    \"Recorded profit\": null,\n    \"Original Preparer\": null,\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n    \"Original Approver\": null,\n    \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n    \"id\": \"Initial20231231001\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Original payment_method\": \"Cash\",\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Account Payable\",\n    \"Original category\": \"Purchase\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Purchase\",\n    \"Original date\": \"2023-12-31\",\n    \"Recorded date\": \"2023-12-31\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n    \"Original quantity\": \"2.0\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"2.0\",\n    \"Original price\": \"500000.0\",\n    \"Recorded price\": \"500000.0\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": null,\n    \"Original amount\": \"1000000.0\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"1000000.0\",\n    \"Original tax\": null,\n    \"Recorded tax\": null,\n    \"Original profit\": null,\n    \"Recorded profit\": null,\n    \"Original Preparer\": \"Staff\",\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": \"Staff\",\n    \"Original Approver\": \"Director\",\n    \"Recorded Approver\": \"Director\",\n    \"id\": \"Purchase20231231009\"\n  }\n] }\n```\n(This format gives the two detected inconsistent rows with fields as described in the instruction.)",
