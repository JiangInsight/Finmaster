So, recorded_amount for Bank deposit should be 5,000,000.0.\n   - The Fixed Assets entry matches the invoice amount, so not an error based on the invoice for 8,000,000.\n\n2. **Sale20240117015**:\n   - invoice: \"an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $1,147,555.96, totaling $1,147,555.96...\"\n   - recorded_unit_price is 1,288,103.99 and recorded_amount is 1,333,433.47. Both are inconsistent with the invoice.\n   - Estimated correct value for both fields should be 1,147,555.96.\n\n**No other gross inconsistencies detected based on the sample and invoice. If a row's amount, unit price, or calculated total do not match the reliable 'invoice' data, it is considered an inconsistency.**\n\n**If you need even more granular detection, for each row, we check, where invoice contradicts any row; if multiple rows with the same ID but different fields, and only one matches the invoice, others are candidates for inconsistency.**",
