Only one row is flagged with a known concrete error per the risk_issues column:  \n   For id \"Sale20240114011\":\n   - The invoice (reliable source) says the sale unit price should be $1,332,686.65.\n   - The row records unit price as 1,304,339.39.\n   - All other fields are consistent or not specified in the risk_issue note.\n2. Thus, the only clear internal inconsistency is:\n   - recorded_unit_price (\"Recorded price\"): 1,304,339.39\n   - Correct/invoice price (\"Original price\"): 1,332,686.65\n3. All other fields for this entry are not flagged, nor is there evidence from the provided invoice text of any other discrepancy or mismatch across other rows given in this problem.\n\n**If there were more risk_issues flagged or other obvious math inconsistencies in the data, those would be included in the solution, but per your example/question structure, only this one is found in this problem set.**",
