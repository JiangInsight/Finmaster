The invoice (the most reliable field) states the amounts and types (\"On December 31, 2023, an invoice was issued for a Cash deposit, totaling $5000000.00.\", etc.), so cross-checking shows that in the first row, the recorded_type and amount do not match the invoice text for that entry—they seem swapped. The same happens for the second. Both \"recorded_type\" and \"recorded_amount\" are internally inconsistent with the invoice field, so we list them with their best estimates as per the invoice text.\n\n2. **Expense20240113001** — The invoice explicitly says \"The payment_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\" However, \"recorded_payment/receipt_status\" is \"Unpaid\" in the record, which contradicts both the invoice and all other similar expense entries. The best estimate is \"Paid\" to match the invoice and similar records.\n\nIf you want a more granular listing for the first three, such as listing all three rows, we can split their swapped/inconsistent values accordingly per line, or as here, group all relevant values and show the mismatches clearly.",
