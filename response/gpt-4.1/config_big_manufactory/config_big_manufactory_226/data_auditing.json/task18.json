Initial20231231001 (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets rows)\n- All three have the same id and date.\n- The invoice says: Cash deposit $5,000,000. \n- There is a row for Bank deposit for $15,000,000, but the invoice indicates only $5,000,000.\n- There is a row for Fixed Assets for $8,000,000, but the same invoice (per date/id) references $5,000,000.\n- Therefore, for id \"Initial20231231001\", the original category and amount in the invoice are \"Cash deposit\" and $5,000,000, while the recorded category and amounts in the other rows are inconsistent. Each should match the invoice, not be $8,000,000 or $15,000,000.\n\n#### 2. Sale20240130027\n- Invoice (\"On January 30, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $2,091,831.76, totaling $2,091,831.76. The cost amount for this transaction was $1,500,000.00, with a tax amount of $104,591.59, leading to a total amount due of $1,987,240.17. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\")\n- However, in the row, `recorded_amount` is 0.0, and `recorded_quantity` is 0, but the invoice says it should be 1.0 and 2,091,831.76 respectively.\n- Also, `recorded_payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\" but the invoice says it was paid.\n- The \"profit\" calculated from invoice should be $2,091,831.76-1,500,000 = $591,831.76, but `recorded_profit` is $601,220.74.\n- So all these fields are inconsistent. The correct values are those from the invoice.",
