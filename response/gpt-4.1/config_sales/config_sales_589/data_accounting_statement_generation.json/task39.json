Identify Beginning and Ending Balances of Interest Receivable\n\nThe \"Interest Receivables\" entries describe the changes in the Interest Receivable account for each transaction date.\n\n- At the beginning (2023-12-31), from prior records, assume interest receivable is **0** (there is no earlier balance).\n- Each time there is an \"Interest Receivables\" entry (type), it is an **increase** to Interest Receivable (all are \"Unpaid\", so nothing is being received in cash).\n- The \"Interest Receivables\" are **not being settled/paid** off in cash, so just add the value at each step.\n\n## 2. Find the (net) increase over the period\n\n**Sum up all the amounts for \"Interest Receivables\".**\n\n### Locate the entries\n\nLet's scan all dates and get the amounts from each Interest Receivables row:\n\n- 2024-01-01: 442.775\n- 2024-01-02: 442.775\n- 2024-01-03: 442.775\n- 2024-01-04: 442.775\n- 2024-01-05: 442.775\n- 2024-01-06: 433.875\n- 2024-01-07: 424.42158019999994\n- 2024-01-08: 424.42158019999994\n- 2024-01-09: 376.8065802\n- 2024-01-10: 376.8065802\n- 2024-01-11: 376.8065802\n- 2024-01-12: 376.8065802\n- 2024-01-13: 376.8065802\n- 2024-01-14: 376.8065802\n- 2024-01-15: 373.6915802\n- 2024-01-16: 373.6915802\n- 2024-01-17: 373.6915802\n- 2024-01-18: 373.6915802\n- 2024-01-19: 369.2415802\n- 2024-01-20: 369.2415802\n- 2024-01-21: 366.57158019999997\n- 2024-01-22: 350.5515802\n- 2024-01-23: 350.5515802\n- 2024-01-24: 350.5515802\n- 2024-01-25: 350.5515802\n- 2024-01-26: 350.5515802\n- 2024-01-27: 350.5515802\n- 2024-01-28: 350.5515802\n\nCheck that there is one entry per date after 2024-01-01.\n\nCount entries:\n\n- 2024-01-01 through 2024-01-06: 6 days\n- 2024-01-07 through 2024-01-20: 14 days\n- 2024-01-21 through 2024-01-28: 8 days\n\nSum up each section:\n\n#### a) 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-05: 5 values, each 442.775\n\n442.775 x 5 = **2213.875**\n\n#### b) 2024-01-06: 433.875\n\ncumulative: 2213.875 + 433.875 = **2647.75**\n\n#### c) 2024-01-07,08: 424.4215802 x 2 = 848.8431604\n\n2647.75 + 848.8431604 = **3496.5931604**\n\n#### d) 2024-01-09,10,11,12,13,14: 376.8065802 x 6 = 2260.8394812\n\n3496.5931604 + 2260.8394812 = **5757.4326416**\n\n#### e) 2024-01-15,16,17,18: 373.6915802 x 4 = 1494.7663208\n\n5757.4326416 + 1494.7663208 = **7252.1989624**\n\n#### f) 2024-01-19,20: 369.2415802 x 2 = 738.4831604\n\n7252.1989624 + 738.4831604 = **7990.6821228**\n\n#### g) 2024-01-21: 366.57158019999997\n\n7990.6821228 + 366.5715802 = **8357.253703**\n\n#### h) 2024-01-22 to 2024-01-28: 350.5515802 x 7 = 2453.8610614\n\n8357.253703 + 2453.8610614 = **10811.1147644**\n\nThis is the ending Interest Receivable balance.\n\n## 3. Calculate the increase in Interest Receivable for the period\n\nSince we were to assume the opening balance at 2023-12-31 is **0** (no data supplied for a start balance), all these are increases.\n\nSo:\n\n- Ending Balance (2024-01-28): __10,811.11__ (rounded to two decimal places)\n- Beginning Balance (2023-12-31): __0.00__\n- **Increase in Interest Receivable:** 10,811.11 - 0.00 = **10,811.11**\n\nThis is an **increase** in Interest Receivable (it is a cash outflow on the cash flow statement, so shown as \"negative\" change for cash flows).\n\n## 4. Formatting the answer\n\nSo in the cash flow statement,\n\n**(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable:** -10,811.11\n\n## 5. Final solution\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-10811.11\"}}\n```",
