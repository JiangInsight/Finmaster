Usually, only *new* transactions in the period are considered as part of the cash flow statement.\n\nSo for the period, we only consider new cash outflows for actual purchases: **FixedAsset20231231001**.\n\n- | FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | ... | 106218.2  | ... | ... | Paid | Bank Transfer | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | Production Line4 | Production Line |\n\nNo disposed fixed assets are listed (no \"sale\" of fixed assets or similar).\n\n#### **None of the other purchases qualify:**\n- All other \"Purchase\" rows are for product inventory, not long-term/fixed assets.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Total Cash Outflows for Investing Activities**\n\nOnly **106,218.2** (Purchase of Production Line) is a cash outflow for investing activities.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Sum up**\n\nNet cash flow from investing activities = **Cash out for fixed asset purchases - Cash in for sale of equipment**\n\nHere, only 106,218.2 cash out, no cash in.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Format as required**\n\nAll cash out will be shown as a negative number (outflow).\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-106218.2\"} }\n```",
