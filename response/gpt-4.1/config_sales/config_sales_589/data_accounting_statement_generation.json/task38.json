Understanding\nThe cash flow statement's \"Accounts Receivable\" row tracks the increase or decrease in receivables between the statement periods.  \n- **Increase in AR** = Outflow of cash (since more sales are made on credit, less cash received)\n- **Decrease in AR** = Inflow of cash (receivables are collected, more cash received)\n\nThe formula:\n> **(Increase) Decrease in AR** = Opening Balance (AR) - Closing Balance (AR)\n\n**If AR goes up, that is a negative (\"(Increase)\") item in the cash flow.**\n**If AR goes down, that is a positive (\"Decrease\") item.**\n\n## 2. What is AR at the start and the end?\n\n### a) Opening AR Balance (2023-12-31)\nLook for all \"Sale\" records before 2024-01-01 with \"Unpaid\"/\"Account Receviable\" as the payment/receive method/status.\n- The initial data, \"Initial20231231001\", does not mention AR.\n- We must sum up all sales before 2024-01-01 that were unpaid / Account Receviable.\n\n#### Purchases do not affect AR, only payables, so **we only consider sales made on credit before 2024-01-01 and not yet paid by 2023-12-31**.\n\nFrom your table, all sales start on 2024-01-02, so **opening AR balance is 0**.\n\n### b) Calculate all new AR generated (credit sales) during the period (2024-01-01 to 2024-01-28)\nFind all \"Sale\" entries in 2024-01-02 to 2024-01-28 where Payment/Receipt status/method is \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Receviable\".\nSum their \"amount\".\n\nLet's go through each day:\n\n#### 2024-01-02\n- Sale20240102004 | 37626.38 | Unpaid | Account Receviable\n#### 2024-01-03\n- Sale20240103007 | 38445.68 | Unpaid | Account Receviable\n\n#### 2024-01-04\n(None for AR, all paid)\n\n#### 2024-01-05\n- Sale20240105015 | 35631.18 | Unpaid | Account Receviable\n\n#### 2024-01-08\n- Sale20240108026 | 37876.84 | Unpaid | Account Receviable\n\n#### 2024-01-09\n- Sale20240109030 | 18677.88 | Unpaid | Account Receviable\n\n#### 2024-01-10\n- Sale20240110036 | 56061.81 | Unpaid | Account Receviable\n\n#### 2024-01-11\n- Sale20240111040 | 105728.19 | Unpaid | Account Receviable\n\n#### 2024-01-12\n- Sale20240112046 | 104829.42 | Unpaid | Account Receviable\n\n#### 2024-01-14\n(None for AR, all paid)\n\n#### 2024-01-15\n- Sale20240115058 | 38068.12 | Unpaid | Account Receviable\n\n#### 2024-01-17\n- Sale20240117065 | 37557.79 | Unpaid | Account Receviable\n- Sale20240117067 | 26920.14 | Unpaid | Account Receviable\n\n#### 2024-01-18\n- Sale20240118070 | 71318.72 | Unpaid | Account Receviable\n\n#### 2024-01-19\n- Sale20240119074 | 38340.34 | Unpaid | Account Receviable\n\n#### 2024-01-20\n- Sale20240120078 | 58291.95 | Unpaid | Account Receviable\n\n#### 2024-01-21\n- Sale20240121081 | 55928.04 | Unpaid | Account Receviable\n- Sale20240121082 | 195264.22 | Unpaid | Account Receviable\n\n#### 2024-01-24\n- Sale20240124090 | 261905.28 | Unpaid | Account Receviable\n\n#### 2024-01-26\n- Sale20240126097 | 39113.14 | Unpaid | Account Receviable\n\n#### 2024-01-27\n- Sale20240127102 | 36474.74 | Unpaid | Account Receviable\n\n#### 2024-01-28\n- Sale20240128109 | 268538.4 | Unpaid | Account Receviable\n\n---\n\n**Let's sum all these AR:**\n\n37626.38  \n38445.68  \n35631.18  \n37876.84  \n18677.88  \n56061.81  \n105728.19  \n104829.42  \n38068.12  \n37557.79  \n26920.14  \n71318.72  \n38340.34  \n58291.95  \n55928.04  \n195264.22  \n261905.28  \n39113.14  \n36474.74  \n268538.4  \n\nNow, add up the numbers:\n\n37626.38  \n+38445.68  \n= 76072.06\n\n76072.06  \n+35631.18  \n= 111703.24\n\n111703.24  \n+37876.84  \n= 149580.08\n\n149580.08  \n+18677.88  \n= 168257.96\n\n168257.96  \n+56061.81  \n= 224319.77\n\n224319.77  \n+105728.19  \n= 330047.96\n\n330047.96  \n+104829.42  \n= 434877.38\n\n434877.38  \n+38068.12  \n= 472945.5\n\n472945.5  \n+37557.79  \n= 510503.29\n\n510503.29  \n+26920.14  \n= 537423.43\n\n537423.43  \n+71318.72  \n= 608742.15\n\n608742.15  \n+38340.34  \n= 647082.49\n\n647082.49  \n+58291.95  \n= 705374.44\n\n705374.44  \n+55928.04  \n= 761302.48\n\n761302.48  \n+195264.22  \n= 956566.7\n\n956566.7  \n+261905.28  \n= 1,218,471.98\n\n1,218,471.98  \n+39113.14  \n= 1,257,585.12\n\n1,257,585.12  \n+36474.74  \n= 1,294,059.86\n\n1,294,059.86  \n+268538.4  \n= 1,562,598.26\n\nSo, the total NEW AR created during the period:  \n**Total Credit Sales = 1,562,598.26**\n\n---\n\n### c) What cash was received against AR (collections)? Find the closing balance.\nBut to know the **closing balance of AR**, we must check whether any of these AR sales were paid/collected during the period.  \nHowever, unless there are \"collection\"/\"Cash\" sales matching AR, the ending AR will be **total AR created,** since beginning AR is zero.\n\nLooking at the data, almost all paid sales are either on the same date or not labeled as collections on past AR -- so there is **no evidence of receivables from prior periods being collected** (since period starts at zero, and cash sales are all new sales).\n\n**Thus, the ending AR balance as of 2024-01-28 is the sum of all AR/credit sales to date:**\n--> **AR at end = 1,562,598.26**\n\n**Opening AR = 0**  \n**Closing AR = 1,562,598.26**\n\n**(Increase) Decrease in AR = Opening AR - Closing AR = 0 - 1,562,598.26 = -1,562,598.26**\n\n---\n\n## 3.
