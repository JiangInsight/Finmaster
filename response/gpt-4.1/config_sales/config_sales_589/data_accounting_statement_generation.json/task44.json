The cash flow statement line \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" should only include actual cash outflows for the purchase of fixed (non-current) assets.\n2. In the provided transactions, we need to find the entry or entries that represent the purchase of fixed assets (not just regular inventory for resale).\n3. Scan the transaction list for a specifically labeled fixed asset purchase, focusing on rows with type like \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar asset-related lines, not just \"Purchase\" of products.\n4. The relevant transaction is:\n\n   ```\n   | FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 106218.2 | 106218.2 |  |  | Paid | Bank Transfer |  | S002 | Supplier 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Production Line4 | Production Line |\n   ```\n\n5. The amount is 106218.2 and the payment status is \"Paid\", payment method is \"Bank Transfer\". The 'asset_name' and 'asset_type' columns confirm this is a fixed asset (Production Line).\n6. No other asset purchases (with asset_name or asset_type specifically relating to fixed assets) appear in the list.\n7. Therefore, the answer is **106218.2**.",
