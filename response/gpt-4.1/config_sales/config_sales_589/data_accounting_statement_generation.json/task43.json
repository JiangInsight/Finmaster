Identify Operating Activities Cash Flows\n\nFor the **Indirect Method**, net cash flow from operating activities is usually:\n\n> Net profit (from operations)  \n> + Add non-cash items (e.g. depreciation, impairment)  \n> + Subtract increases in working capital (current assets)  \n> + Add decreases in working capital (current assets)  \n> + Add increases in current liabilities (accounts payable etc.)  \n> - Subtract decreases in current liabilities  \n> = Net cash from operating activities\n\nBut for a clear task as here (\"based on transaction data\") and the format (journals), we can sum up all:\n\n- **Cash inflows** from normal business operations (sales receipts, interest income received in cash, etc.)\n- **Cash outflows** from operating costs (purchase of inventory paid, paid expenses, cash taxes, etc.)\n\n*We exclude investing/financing activities: e.g. fixed asset purchases (investing), initial deposits (financing/equity/capital injection), etc.*\n\n### Exclusions\n\n- **Ignore** \"Initial\" cash/bank deposit (Opening balances; not operating inflow)\n- **Ignore** \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" (Investing outflow)\n- **Ignore** \"Depreciation\" (Non-cash, adjust in indirect, but here as per example, we don't use)\n- **Ignore unpaid purchases/expenses/interest** (not yet a cash flow)\n- **Interest receivable**: Only count if collected in cash (almost all here are \"Unpaid\")\n- **Account Receivable**: Ignore sales on credit (no cash yet)\n- **Account Payable**: Ignore purchases/expenses unpaid (no cash flow yet)\n- **Cash or Bank Transfer between cash/bank:** Should not affect net operating cash flow, they're just within the cash pool.\n\nSo for this data:  \n- Only **Cash receipts from customers** (Sales with \"Paid\" status, and cash receive method)  \n- Only **Paid Purchases**, Paid Expenses (with payment method \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\")  \n\n---\n\n### 2. List all cash-flow-impacting lines\n\n#### a) Sales Receipts (Cash Inflows: Paid, Cash sales)\n\nFind all sales, \"Paid\" Only:\n\nSum \"amount\" field for all sales with \"Paid\" in payment/receipt_status  \n(We ignore \"Unpaid\" sales as they do not bring in cash yet.
