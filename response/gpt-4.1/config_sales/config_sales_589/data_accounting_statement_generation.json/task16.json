Definition**\n- Paid-in Capital reflects the funds invested in the business by shareholders/owners (\"Initial capital contribution\") and is not affected by purchases, sales, expenses, or regular business income and outflows in the short term unless there is new capital injection or capital withdrawal.\n\n**2. Identify Paid-In Capital Transactions**\n- Search for lines describing \"Initial deposit\", \"Initial capital\", \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\" at company start, or records labeled with \"Initial...\" in id/type.\n\n**3. In the Provided Data**\n- Only these three transactions at the top of the table represent the paid-in capital at business inception:\n    - | Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit   | 2023-12-31 | ... | 3,000,000.0 |\n    - | Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit   | 2023-12-31 | ... | 5,000,000.0 |\n    - | Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets   | 2023-12-31 | ... | 5,000,000.0 |\n\n**4. Calculate Initial Paid-In Capital**\n- Sum: 3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 = 13,000,000.0\n\n**5. Check for Additional Capital Changes**\n- Review all transactions for any that would increase/decrease paid-in capital (new owner investment, capital withdrawal, shares issued, etc.)\n- There are **no such transactions**; all others are normal business (purchases, expenses, depreciation, interest, sales, etc.) and **do not affect paid-in capital**.\n\n**6. Final Value**\n- Since there is neither capital increase nor capital reduction, the end value is the same as the initial: **13,000,000.0**\n\n**7. Format**\n- Both numbers formatted with two decimal places.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Paid-in Capital Initial Value:** 13,000,000.00\n- **Paid-in Capital End Value:** 13,000,000.00",
