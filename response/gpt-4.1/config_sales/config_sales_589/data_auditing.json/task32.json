But as all invoice texts match the recorded rows, we simply note the conflicting presence but cannot override amounts without further detail.\n- **Purchase20231231016:** Per the provided risk issue and invoice, the Original values from the invoice are quantity 7.0, unit price 20000.0, amount 140,000.00, and date 2023-12-31. The recorded values in the table are: quantity 6.0, unit price 18841.98, amount 154329.31, and date 2024-01-07. All the other columns match. The invoice is generally more reliable, so \"Original\" should reflect invoice values.\n\nAll other rows' invoice text matches the row values, with no internal inconsistency versus the structured fields. If more inconsistencies were present (e.g., between amount and computed amount), they would be listed in similar detail per the instruction.",
