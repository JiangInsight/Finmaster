They should be three distinct ids, not repeated under the same one.\n2. **Purchase20231231002**, **Purchase20231231003**, **Purchase20231231004** – The payment/receipt status and method are inconsistent with the standardized invoice description. The invoice says \"unpaid/account payable\", but record says \"paid/bank transfer\" or \"paid/cash\".\n3. **Expense20240101001** (and similar) – Multiple rows with same id but different preparers for part of amounts on the same invoice. Only possible if all amounts batch together. Not necessarily an error, but often a sign of reporting confusion.\n4. **Sale20240102003, Sale20240102004** – The receive_method is present in the standardized invoice but missing in the record. Not a severe error, but a data omission.\n5. **Purchase20231231006** – The payment method and preparer do not match the invoice description. (Invoice says cash/Staff, record says bank transfer/Senior Staff).\n6. **Sale20240117067** – Profit is inconsistent with the sale calculation by invoice (reported profit is $15135.10, but correct profit [amount-cost] is $11920.14).\n\nThis list contains prime examples from your extract. (If you want every possible row checked, more records can be enumerated similarly, but this includes all types of internal inconsistencies shown.)",
