The invoice describes a sale of 3 units of Premium Product B at $17398.49, totaling $52195.47. Therefore, the `recorded_type` should be \"Sale\" not \"Depreciation\".\n- In addition, the `recorded_tax_amount` is given as \"40356.09\", which is vastly different from the tax as implied by the invoice or by calculation: for a unit price of $17398.49 and 3 units, $52195.47 total; tax is stated in the invoice as $2609.77. Therefore, `Original tax` should be $2609.77, not $40356.09.\n- All other fields appear either correct or cannot be definitively assessed as inconsistent based on the available information.\n\nNo other fields in your supplied data are obviously inconsistent on a row-wise basis (i.e., for exact within-row contradictions between 'recorded' and what the standardized invoice narrative or other fields strongly imply). If you have more cases or want batch error detection for other errors, please provide or specify further.\n```",
