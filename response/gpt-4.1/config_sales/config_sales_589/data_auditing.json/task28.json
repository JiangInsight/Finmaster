Typically, cash and bank (liquidity) + fixed assets should match the initial investment, but the sum for Cash + Bank + Fixed Assets = 13,000,000, not matching any likely equity structure. Moreover, both bank deposit and fixed assets are listed for 5,000,000. Itâ€™s abnormal that the bank deposit and fixed assets have the same figure, which may be a miskey. Usually, these three should be distinct or their sum should fit a logical investment entry.\n   - Likely, the correct should be: Cash: 3000000, Bank: 5000000, Fixed Assets: 2000000 (so total initial is 10,000,000, which is typical for a round investment number).\n\n2. **Sale20240107022:**  \n   - Invoice ('On January 07, 2024, ... 1.0 unit at unit price $34907.97, total $34907.97') says quantity 1.0, unit price 34907.97, amount 34907.97.  \n   - Recorded unit price: 32029.81, amount: 39088.05, date 2024-01-28, but invoice date should be 2024-01-07, indicating wrong date, price, and amount recorded.  \n   - Best estimate: Use invoice values:  \n     - date: 2024-01-07  \n     - unit price: 34907.97  \n     - amount: 34907.97\n\n(Note: Other rows in your sample do not show inconsistencies as the key fields all match the invoice text.
