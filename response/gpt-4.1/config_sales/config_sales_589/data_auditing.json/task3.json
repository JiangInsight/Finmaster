The payment_method of this transaction was account payable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n- Recorded values show: amount $250000.00, payment_method 'Cash', and payment/receipt_status 'Paid'.\n- Inconsistencies: amount should be $25000.00, payment_method 'Account Payable', payment/receipt_status 'Unpaid'.\n- Correction fields as above.\n\n### 2. `Expense20240128001`\n- The invoice says: \"a Administrative Expenses, totaling $24776.04. The payment_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- Recorded value: payment/receipt_status is 'Unpaid' (should be 'Paid').\n- Correction fields as above.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \n- All other entries either match their invoice-sourced (authoritative) values or do not show multi-entry/internal discrepancies for the same transaction ID, based on the provided extract.  \n- Other fields such as supplier, quantity, etc., do not show inconsistency between recoding and the underlying invoice (as far as the data is given).\n```",
