The payment_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- The table shows this record as having `Bank Transfer` in `recorded_payment_method`, but the invoice supports 'Cash'.\n- Therefore, the only inconsistency is: `payment_method` should be `'Cash'`, but it is recorded as `'Bank Transfer'`.\n- No other field exhibits internal inconsistency per row or between invoice and table for this record.\n```",
