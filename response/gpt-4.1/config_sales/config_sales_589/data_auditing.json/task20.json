Invoice for Sale20240120080 says:  \n   - Category: \"Sale\"\n   - 2.0 units at unit price $95010.60, total $190021.20\n   - Cost: $100,000; Tax: $9501.06; After tax: $180,520.14; Paid in cash\n2. In the row:\n   - Type is recorded as \"Depreciation\" (should be \"Sale\" per reliable invoice)\n   - Unit price is recorded as $98,150.95 (should be $95,010.60 per invoice)\n   - Other fields generally match or invoice fields are present where available (receipt method = cash, quantity = 2.0, etc.)\n3. Therefore, the internal inconsistencies are: category/type and unit price. The correct values can be determined from the invoice (as per prompt). Other fields either match invoice or are missing in both.\n4. All other fields that differ between invoice and entry are null/missing or match; only the above are inconsistent.",
