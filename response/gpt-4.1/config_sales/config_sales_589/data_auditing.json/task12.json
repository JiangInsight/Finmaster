This is internally inconsistent; id must uniquely identify a transaction line. Invoice text (usually reliable) matches type+amount, so correct is probably three distinct ids, not three lines with one id. Note inconsistency but cannot resolve the correct category without original data.\n\n2. **Purchase20231231024** – From the invoice field: “… This transaction was prepared by Senior Staff, and the approver is Director.” However, the Recorded Approver is blank. So Recorded Approver should be \"Director\".\n\n> All other entries either have consistent invoice-to-field mappings, or, for sales/purchase lines, the sub-fields (amount = quantity x unit price, etc.) are all consistent, and names match. Only the above two show actual inconsistencies that can be confidently identified.\n",
