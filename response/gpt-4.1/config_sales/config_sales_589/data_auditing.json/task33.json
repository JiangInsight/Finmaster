The cost amount for this transaction was $100000.00, with a tax amount of $9979.67, leading to a total amount due of $189613.71. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- However, the transaction row records type as \"Sales Expenses\" instead of \"Sale\", date as \"2024-02-07\" instead of \"2024-01-25\", price as \"99032.61\" instead of \"99796.69\", amount as \"242973.13\" instead of \"199593.38\", and tax as \"193732.19\" instead of \"9979.67\".\n- The rest of the fields match or are missing but not inconsistent.\n- The more reliable 'invoice' is used for the \"Original\" values.",
