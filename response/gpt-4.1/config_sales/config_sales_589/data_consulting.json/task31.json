Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales (or Total Revenue) / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n- Total Revenue (Main Business Revenue): 5,695,115.02\n- Accounts Receivable at beginning (2023-12-31): 0.00\n- Accounts Receivable at end (2024-01-28): 1,562,598.26\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 1,562,598.26)/2 = 781,299.13\n\n**Calculation:**  \n5,695,115.02 / 781,299.13 ≈ 7.29\n\n**BUT**: In the example when AR went from 0 to X, they used ending AR for denominator, so to match example:  \n5,695,115.02 / 1,562,598.26 ≈ 3.65\n\n**BUT**: Average is standard; using average unless the problem insists.\n\nHence,  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: 7.29\n\nBut wait: The example used average (in their example: 5,431,018.59 / (0+2,429,482.13)/2 = 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.07 = 4.47, which matches). So average is right.\n\nSo:\n\n5,695,115.02 / 781,299.13 = 7.29\n\nBut my earlier response says 4.36; let's be precise:\n\nAverage AR = (0 + 1,562,598.26)/2 = 781,299.13  \nART ratio = 5,695,115.02 / 781,299.13 = 7.29\n\n---\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -224,133.22  \nCurrent Liabilities (end): 829,755.77\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -224,133.22 / 829,755.77 = -0.27\n\nBut in the example, they rounded to two decimals and represented as '-3.90' (for -7,259,994.10/1,861,550.92). Here:\n\n-224,133.22 / 829,755.77 = -0.27\n\n---\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThe same as Operating Cash Flow Ratio: they are identical in the example.\n\nSo: -0.27\n\n---\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Total Assets\n\nTotal Revenue: 5,695,115.02  \nTotal Assets (Beg): 13,000,000.00  \nTotal Assets (End): 15,023,526.85  \nAverage Total Assets = (13,000,000 + 15,023,526.85)/2 = 14,011,763.43\n\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = 5,695,115.02 / 14,011,763.43 ≈ 0.41\n\n---\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n\nTotal Liabilities (equals Total Current Liabilities): 829,755.77  \nTotal Owner's Equity: 14,193,771.08\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 829,755.77 / 14,193,771.08 ≈ 0.06\n\n---\n\n## FINAL (rounded to two decimals as per example):\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"7.29\",\n  \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-0.27\",\n  \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.27\",\n  \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.41\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.06\"\n} }\n```",
