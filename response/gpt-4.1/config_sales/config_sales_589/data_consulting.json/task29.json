                        "content": "```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.06\",\n  \"Net Profit Margin\": \"20.96%\",\n  \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"7.95%\",\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"5.27\"\n} }\n```\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio**\n\n   Formula:  \n   Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n\n   From the balance sheet (end of period):  \n   Total Liabilities = 829,755.77  \n   Total Owner's Equity = 14,193,771.08\n\n   Calculation:  \n   Debt to Equity = 829,755.77 / 14,193,771.08 ≈ 0.0584 → **0.06**\n\n----------\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin**\n\n   Formula:  \n   Net Profit Margin = Net Profit / Total Revenue\n\n   From the income statement:  \n   Net Profit = 1,193,771.08  \n   Total Revenue = 5,695,115.02\n\n   Calculation:  \n   Net Profit Margin = 1,193,771.08 / 5,695,115.02 ≈ 0.2096 → **20.96%**\n\n----------\n\n3. **Return on Assets (ROA)**\n\n   Formula:  \n   ROA = Net Profit / Average Total Assets\n\n   Total Assets (Beginning) = 13,000,000.00  \n   Total Assets (Ending) = 15,023,526.85  \n   Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 15,023,526.85) / 2 = 14,011,763.43\n\n   Calculation:  \n   ROA = 1,193,771.08 / 14,011,763.43 ≈ 0.0852 → **8.52%**\n\n   BUT, as per your sample, you prefer to use Ending Assets for a period shorter than a year. However, using the same sample logic (examples with average assets), we keep **average assets** and thus **8.52%**.  \n\n   Adjusting to your prior sample’s method (using end-period assets):  \n   ROA = 1,193,771.08 / 15,023,526.85 ≈ 0.0795 → **7.95%**\n\n----------\n\n4. **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio**\n\n   Formula:  \n   A/R Turnover = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n   Assume all revenue is credit (if not stated otherwise):  \n   Net Credit Sales = Total Revenue = 5,695,115.02\n\n   Accounts Receivable (Beginning) = 0.00  \n   Accounts Receivable (Ending) = 1,562,598.26  \n   Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 1,562,598.26) / 2 = 781,299.13\n\n   Calculation:  \n   A/R Turnover = 5,695,115.02 / 781,299.13 ≈ 7.29\n\n   However, in your official example, you use just **ending accounts receivable** (not average). Let’s follow that:  \n   A/R Turnover = 5,695,115.02 / 1,562,598.26 ≈ 3.65\n\n   But the example actually does use **average** in the calculation!  \n   For input:  \n   | Total Revenue | 5,431,018.59 |  \n   | Accounts Receivable (End) | 2,429,482.13 |  \n   | Accounts Receivable (Start) | 0.00 |  \n   Average = 2,429,482.13 / 2 = 1,214,741.06  \n   Turnover: 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 = 4.47 (matches example).\n\n   Our case:  \n   5,695,115.02 / 781,299.13 = 7.29\n\n   BUT, wait: Are we sure the example is using average? In the example:  \n   5,431,018.59 / (2,429,482.13/2) = 4.47\n\n   Therefore, our calculation above with average is correct:  \n   5,695,115.02 / 781,299.13 ≈ **7.29**\n\n   But that seems very high compared to the profit margin and industry norm. Double checking:  \n   Maybe given the time period is less than a year, as in the example, let's project the figures as if for the same period (one month), so the ratio for a month is ~7.29, for a year would be much higher. However, your examples are fine with the monthly period.\n   \n   Still, keep the mathematically correct number: **7.29**\n\n----------\n\nBut to be consistent with reasoning and formatting in the example, rounding to two decimals and using only the numbers above, the final answer should be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.06\",\n  \"Net Profit Margin\": \"20.96%\",\n  \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"7.95%\",\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"7.29\"\n} }\n```\n\n----------\n\n**If you prefer to format as in the previous example (values rounded to 2 decimals for ratios and to two decimal places for others):**\n\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.06\n- Net Profit Margin: 20.96%\n- Return on Assets (ROA): 7.95%\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: 7.29\n\n----------",
