Formula:**\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales (usually Total Revenue) / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n**2. Find Net Credit Sales (from income statement):**\nMain Business Revenue or Total Revenue = 5,695,115.02\n\n**3. Find Accounts Receivable (from balance sheet):**\n- Beginning (2023-12-31): 0.00\n- Ending (2024-01-28): 1,562,598.26\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable = (Beginning + Ending) / 2  \n= (0.00 + 1,562,598.26) / 2  \n= 781,299.13\n\n**4. Calculation:**\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 5,695,115.02 / 781,299.13 ≈ 7.29\n\n**BUT:** The time period covered is from 2023-12-31 to 2024-01-28, which is 28 days (approx. 1 month), not a full year. Usually, this ratio is annualized. If you need the monthly turnover ratio, you can report as is. For annualization:\n\nAnnualized Turnover = (Revenue for 28 days) / Average AR × (365/28)\n\nBut given the example provided does not annualize and simply uses reported sales and average AR, let's follow that approach.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 5,695,115.02 / 1,208,948.695 (wait: this incorrectly averages 0 and 1,562,598.26 as 1,208,948.695 whereas the correct average is 781,299.13; previous answer had a mistake).\n\nCorrection:\n(0 + 1,562,598.26) / 2 = 781,299.13\n\nTurnover = 5,695,115.02 / 781,299.13 ≈ 7.29\n\nThe earlier example used ending AR (2,429,482.13), but the formula is more correct with the average.\n\nStill, the other example ratio was calculated as:\n5,431,018.59 / (0 + 2,429,482.13) / 2 = 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 ≈ 4.47\n\nBut the ratio used in the sample seems to use only ending AR OR perhaps used revenue/(ending AR)?\n\nSample: 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 = 4.47\n\nWait. No. That can't be. If we check with their numbers:\n\n5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 = 4.47\n\nBut, 1,214,741.065 is (0 + 2,429,482.13)/2. So yes, average.\n\nSo, for this case, it's 5,695,115.02 / 781,299.13 = 7.29.\n\n**Answer:** 7.29\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"7.29\"}}\n```\n",
