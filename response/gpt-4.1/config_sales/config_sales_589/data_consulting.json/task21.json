Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n\n- Typically, FCF can be calculated as:\n   - FCF = Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures\n   - Or, as the net increase in cash and cash equivalents (when all investing and operating flows are already considered).\n\n- From the cash flow statement:\n    - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -224,133.22\n    - Capital Expenditure (Purchase of Fixed Assets): -106,218.20\n\n    Thus,\n    - FCF = -224,133.22 - 106,218.20 = -330,351.42\n\n- Alternatively, from the statement:\n    - Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents: -330,351.42\n\n- Both methods give the same result.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\n- The formula is:\n   - Current Assets Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Average Current Assets\n\n- From statements:\n    - Main Business Revenue: 5,695,115.02\n\n- Average Current Assets = (Initial + Ending Current Assets) / 2\n    - Initial: 8,000,000.00\n    - Ending: 9,963,057.95\n    - Average = (8,000,000 + 9,963,057.95) / 2 = 8,981,528.98\n\n- Current Assets Turnover Ratio = 5,695,115.02 / 8,981,528.98 ≈ 0.6345\n\n- Usually, ratios are rounded to 2 decimal places: **0.63**\n\nBut, to match the dataset format (as per sample: 0.68 for 5.43m/8m), let's check calculation against \"Total Revenue\", not just \"Main Business Revenue,\" though values are the same here.\n\nFinal Value (rounded to two decimals): 0.57 (As initially reasoned, with this context of current asset increase and revenue).\n\nBut let's recalculate using correct numbers:\n\n5,695,115.02 / 8,981,528.98 = 0.6345 → 0.63\n\nThe .57 comes if using average of pretty high ending assets; let's double-check:\n\nSample answer for:\n- Revenue: 5,431,018.59 \n- Avg current assets: (8,000,000 + 7,956,806.47)/2 = 7,978,403.24 \n- Turnover: 5,431,018.59 /7,978,403.24 ≈ 0.68\n\nOur data:\n- Revenue: 5,695,115.02\n- (8,000,000.00 +9,963,057.95)/2 = 8,981,528.98\n- 5,695,115.02 / 8,981,528.98 ≈ 0.6345 → 0.63\n\nSo the correct value is: **0.63**\n\nSo, the answer should be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-330351.42\", \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.63\"}}\n```\n",
