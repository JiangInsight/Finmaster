Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nFormula:  \nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -224,133.22  \n- Total Current Liabilities: 829,755.77  \n= -224133.22 / 829755.77 ≈ -0.27\n\n---\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\nFormula:  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner’s Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities: 829,755.77  \n- Total Owner’s Equity: 14,193,771.08  \n= 829755.77 / 14193771.08 ≈ 0.06\n\n---\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nFormula:  \nTotal Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average Total Assets\n\n- Revenue: 5,695,115.02  \n- Average Total Assets: (13,000,000 + 15,023,526.85) / 2 = 14,011,763.43  \n= 5695115.02 / 14011763.43 ≈ 0.41 (If you want less rounding, but since sample uses 0.41 for .41, but here using above numbers, let's use 0.41. Correct calculation: 5695115.02 / 14011763.43 = 0.4066 ≈ 0.41)\n\nBut the example used 0.41 for 0.41 too. So the correct is 0.41 (rounded to 2 decimals). But since 5695115.02/14011763.43=0.4066≈0.41\n\n--- \n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\nFormula:  \nQuick Ratio = (Cash & Equivalents + Bank Deposits + Receivables) / Current Liabilities  \n- Cash & Equivalents: 3,730,866.78  \n- Bank Deposits: 3,938,781.80  \n- Interest Receivable: 10,811.11  \n- Accounts Receivable: 1,562,598.26  \n- Total: 3,730,866.78 + 3,938,781.80 + 10,811.11 + 1,562,598.26 = 9,243,058  \n- Inventory: 720,000.00 (not included in quick assets)\n- Current Liabilities: 829,755.77\n\n9,243,058 / 829,755.77 ≈ 11.14 (but need to be consistent with provided working method in examples, there the answer was 1.54 by using only (cash+bank+interest/account receivable)/current liabilities. So check how the example did it:\n\nIn the example: (Ending Cash + Bank + Interest Receivable + AR) / Current Liabilities\n= (270005.9+164645.57+2672.87+2429482.13)/1861550.92 = 2864806.47/1861550.92 ≈ 1.54\n\nSo here: (3,730,866.78 + 3,938,781.80 + 10,811.11 + 1,562,598.26) / 829,755.77 = 9,243,058 / 829,755.77 ≈ 11.14\n\nI'll round to two decimal places: 11.14, but to be consistent with significant digits, let's use two decimal places: 11.14\n\nBut I made a typo in above, the correct sum:\n3730866.78 + 3938781.80 + 10811.11 + 1562598.26 = 9243058\n\n9243058 / 829755.77 ≈ 11.14\n\nSo report: 11.14\n\nBut in benchmark, the example goes to two decimals. Although the question said \"Quick Ratio\": '1.54' for '2864806.47/1861550.92'. So, accurate two decimals.\n\n--- \n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nUsually the same as operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities = -224133.22 / 829755.77 = -0.27\n\n---\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\nFormula:  \nROE = Net Profit / Average Equity\n\n- Net Profit: 1,193,771.08  \n- Average Equity: (13,000,000 + 14,193,771.08) / 2 = 13,596,885.54  \nROE = 1,193,771.08 / 13,596,885.54 ≈ 0.0878 = 8.78%  \n\nBut the example went to two decimals for % sign. Let's round to 8.41%\nLet's check: 1193771.08/13596885.54 = 0.0878 = 8.78%\n\nBut in the example, they used (Net Profit) / Average Equity, so that's correct. Let's report 8.78%.\n\nHowever, original equity is 13,000,000. Ending is 14,193,771.08.  \nSo (13,000,000 + 14,193,771.08) / 2 = 13,596,885.54\n\n1193771.08 / 13596885.54 = 0.0878 --> 8.78%\n\nLet's check if the example method matches--\nIn the example:  \nNet Profit: -1645141.43, Total Owner’s Equity at period end: 11354858.57, at start 13000000.00, so average: (13,000,000+11,354,858.57)/2 = 12,177,429.29  \n-1645141.43/12177429.29 = -0.1351 = -13.51%. That's exactly the 'ROE' in the example. So our calculation above is consistent. Use 8.78%. \n\n--- \n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nFormula:  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n- Revenue: 5,695,115.02  \n- Beginning AR: 0.00  \n- Ending AR: 1,562,598.26  \n- Average AR: (0 + 1,562,598.26)/2 = 781,299.13  \n- AR turnover = 5,695,115.02 / 781,299.13 ≈ 7.29\n\nIn the example: they used 5431018.59/ (0+2429482.13)/2 = 5431018.59/ 1214741.07 = 4.47 (which matches the sample solution).  \nSo for this: 5695115.02 / 781299.13 = 7.29\n\n---\n\n## Final revised answers:\n\n- operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio: \"-0.27\"\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: \"0.06\"\n- Total Asset Turnover Ratio: \"0.41\"\n- Quick Ratio: \"11.14\"\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: \"-0.27\"\n- Return on Equity (ROE): \"8.78%\"\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: \"7.29\"\n\nIf you want rounding consistency with examples (two decimals), those are correct.\n\n## Final JSON:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.27\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.06\",\n  \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.41\",\n  \"Quick Ratio\": \"11.14\",\n  \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.27\",\n  \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"8.78%\",\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"7.29\"\n} }\n```\n",
