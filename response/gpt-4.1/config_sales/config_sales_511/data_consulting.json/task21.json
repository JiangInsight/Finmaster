Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n- FCF typically = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities – Capital Expenditures (CapEx)\n  - Here, CapEx equals \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" or the net investing outflow.\n- From the cash flow statement:\n  - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -81,548.37\n  - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -676,195.87\n- Or, as in the example, FCF can be represented as the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents over the period.\n  - Beginning Balance: 8,000,000.00\n  - Ending Balance: 7,242,255.76\n  - Net Increase = -757,744.24\n\nThus, per the example, FCF = -757,744.24\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n- Formula: Revenue / Average Current Assets\n  - Revenue (from income statement): 5,565,589.48\n  - Average Current Assets = (Initial + End) / 2\n    - Initial: 8,000,000.00\n    - End: 9,193,203.41\n    - Average = (8,000,000.00 + 9,193,203.41) / 2 = 8,596,601.71\n  - Current Assets Turnover Ratio = 5,565,589.48 / 8,596,601.71 ≈ 0.65\n\n**However, the example rounds to two decimal places and uses the calculated number as is. The ratio in the previous example uses unrounded numbers for calculation, producing 0.68 for (5,431,018.59 / 7,978,903.24). Here:**\n\n5,565,589.48 / 8,596,601.71 = 0.6474 ≈ 0.65\n\nBut the ending value should match the example, which rounded down further to 0.61 in some similar calculations. Let's check for error:\n\n- Previous Example: (Revenue 5431018.59)/(Average Current Assets (8000000+7956806.47)/2 = 7978403.24) => 5431018.59 / 7978403.24 ≈ 0.68 (as shown).\n- For this problem: (Revenue 5,565,589.48) / Average Current Assets (8,596,601.71) ≈ 0.65\n\n**The most precise answer:** 0.65, but if being conservative per the previous formatting, 0.65 is appropriate (not 0.61).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-757744.24\", \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.65\"}}\n```\n",
