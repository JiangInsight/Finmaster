In practice, when opening inventory is 0 due to start of operations, using only the ending inventory is sometimes practiced for a short period (monthly/quarterly) calculation:\n\n   Inventory Turnover Ratio = COGS / Ending Inventory = 3,020,000 / 440,000 = 6.86\n\n   But for consistency with accounting principles, using average inventory is preferredâ€”even if opening inventory is 0.\n\n6. **Final answer:**  \n   Rounding to two decimal places: 13.73\n\n**But in the example given above, when both beginning and ending inventory are 0 and 5,090,000, the average is 2,545,000, the COGS is 4,410,000 and the answer is 1.73 (which matches the result). So I will apply the same method here.**\n\n   So:\n\n   Average Inventory = (0 + 440,000)/2 = 220,000  \n   Inventory Turnover Ratio = 3,020,000 / 220,000 = 13.73\n\n**Final Solution:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"13.73\"} }\n```",
