Current Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nCurrent Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom balance sheet (as of 2024-01-27):  \n- Total Current Assets = 9,193,203.41  \n- Total Current Liabilities = 728,279.50  \n\n**Calculation:**  \nCurrent Ratio = 9,193,203.41 / 728,279.50 ≈ **12.62**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold (from income statement): 3,020,000.00\n\n- Beginning Inventory (from balance sheet at 2023-12-31): 0.00  \n- Ending Inventory (from balance sheet at 2024-01-27): 440,000.00\n\n**Average Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2**  \nAverage Inventory = (0 + 440,000) / 2 = 220,000.00\n\n**Calculation:**  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = 3,020,000 / 220,000 ≈ **13.73**\n\n#### But, as the inventory was 0 at the start (possibly new operations), it is common practice to use ending inventory if the business just started, or the average is still proper as per above. Since the example in your prompt with zero beginning inventory used average of (0 + end)/2, we maintain that method.\n\n**Inventory Turnover Ratio = 3,020,000 / 220,000 = 13.73**\n\nBut the example in your prompt had a similar situation and returned a ratio slightly less (due to COGS 4,410,000 / average inventory of 2,545,000 = 1.73), which shows that approach is correct using average.\n\nUpon rechecking:  \n- COGS = 3,020,000  \n- Average Inventory = (0+440,000)/2 = 220,000  \n- Ratio = 3,020,000 / 220,000 = **13.73**\n\nBut let's double-check for accidental decimal error:  \n3,020,000 / 220,000 = 13.7272...\n\nSo, the correct value is **13.73** (rounded to 2 decimals).\n\n---\n\n### FINAL ANSWER\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Current Ratio\": \"12.62\", \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"13.73\"}}\n```",
