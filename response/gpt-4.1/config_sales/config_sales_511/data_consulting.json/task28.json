To follow the most consistent style with provided previous solution, best to use **-0.11**.\n    - But if strictly matching the first decimal as in example (\"-3.90\"), then **-0.11**.\n\n**Note:** If you want to be consistent with 2 significant digits after decimal, answer is **\"-0.11\"**, but the ratio is very small, almost zero.\n\nHence, the ratios are:\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.05\n- Gross Profit Margin: 45.76%\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -0.11\n\nBut in my initial answer above I kept it as \"-0.01\"; I should have realized it's \"-0.11\". Let's fix it:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.05\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"45.76%\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.11\"\n}}\n```",
