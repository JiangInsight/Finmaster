Identify & extract:\n        - Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers (such as Selling Expenses; from income statement).\n        - Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets (such as Purchase of Fixed Assets; from cash flow statement).\n    2. Output the two values, grouped by statement as in examples; in original line item order.\n\n- From the **income statement**:\n    - Selling Expenses = 662884.34 (this is the relevant \"cost incurred to secure and deliver\")\n  \n- From the **cash flow statement**:\n    - Purchase of Fixed Assets = 676195.87 (this is the cash paid for long-term asset acquisition)\n\n**So:**\n- value1 = 662884.34 (from income statement - Selling Expenses)\n- value2 = 676195.87 (from cash flow statement - Purchase of Fixed Assets)",
