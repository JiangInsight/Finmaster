                        "content": "Let's solve this step by step according to the composition of the balance sheet:\n\n**Step 1: Find Initial Value**\nThe balance sheet is based on:\n- **Assets** = **Liabilities + Owners Equity**\n- The sum of all initial asset balances (cash+bank+fixed assets) equals Equity at initial point (assuming no liabilities at opening).\n\n#### All initial balances (from \"Initial20231231001\"):\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00\n\n**Sum:**  \n3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = **13,000,000.00**\n\nAt opening, typically liabilities are zero, so all is Owners Equity.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Find End Value**\n\nAt end, total assets **equal** total liabilities and owners’ equity.\n\nWe need to sum all assets at the end of the period:\n- Cash\n- Bank\n- Accounts Receivable\n- Inventory (Purchases - COGS)\n- Fixed Assets (incl. initial + additions - depreciation)\n- Interest Receivable\n\nSince all transactions are presented, let's sum up final assets.\n\n---\n\n### A. Cash & Bank\n\n**a) Opening (sum both):** 3,000,000 (cash) + 5,000,000 (bank) = 8,000,000\n\n**b) Cash ins:**  \n- All cash sales (sum amounts, e.g. \"Sale\" with \"Cash\")  \n- Exclude \"Paid\" sales marked as unpaid/receivable  \n**c) Cash outs:**  \n- All cash/bank payments to \"Purchase\", \"Expense\", \"Fixed Asset Purchase\"\n- Expense lines paid in cash\n- Purchases paid by cash/bank transfer  \n- *Do not double count transfers between cash and bank (they do not change total funds but change component balances)*\n\nBut as per accounting, we don't need to split cash/bank as all are assets, so let's move on.\n\n---\n\n### B. Accounts Receivable (A/R):\n\n- Unpaid sales (\"Sale\" lines with \"Paid\" != \"Cash\" or \"Account Receivable\")\n- Add up all sales where \"Paid\", \"Account Receivable\", or \"Unpaid\" - and sum for A/R\n\n### C. Inventory\n\n- Opening: All purchases (sum cost amounts) minus COGS (from sale cost_amount), plus additions, minus items sold.\n\nBut we only need to get total assets for Equity+Liabilities, so let's proceed with the \"shortcut\" by summing all (net asset increase/decrease by: net profit + capital + liabilities).\n\n---\n\n#### **Quick approach (as in the original example and for tasks of this kind):**\n**Sum up all:**\n1. Opening: All assets (Initial lines)\n2. Add: All purchases (include Fixed Asset purchases) - increases assets (cash leaves, asset increases)\n3. Add: All sales profit (equals net asset increase)\n4. Subtract: All expenses (reduce assets)\n5. Add: All increases in current assets (Accounts Receivable, Interest Receivable, etc.)\n6. Add: All other asset increases/decreases.\n\nBut the \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity\" at any time equals *Total Assets at that time*.\n\nSo we can sum all assets as of end date.\n\n---\n\n## Let's do this carefully.\n\n### **Step A: Opening Assets Total**\n\nAlready found: 13,000,000.00\n\n### **Step B: Asset Movements**\n\n#### **1. Purchases**\nAll \"Purchase\" and \"FixedAssets\" lines (increase assets by the amount paid, but paid from cash/bank, so net asset unchanged, except for those left as payable).\n- But stay focused: net asset only changes if payment status is \"Unpaid\" (so, asset up, liability also up).\n\n#### **2. Expenses**\nAll \"Expense\" lines -- expenses reduce assets (cash/bank lowered, no asset increase, so reduce total assets).\n\n#### **3. Sales**\nSales:  \n- \"Profit\" is the net asset increase per sale (from sales less COGS, taxes, etc.)\n\n#### **4. Depreciation**\nDepreciation is a non-cash charge, reduces fixed assets and thus reduces equity.\n\n#### **5. Interest Receivable**\nAdd up all Interest Receivable (not yet received, so increases asset).\n\n---\n\n#### Summing step by step:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Opening total assets = 13,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Purchases and Fixed Asset Additions**\n\nPurchases and fixed assets initially paid from cash/bank - so NO effect on overall assets unless purchased \"on account\" (unpaid, increases asset + liability):\n\nCheck all \"Purchase\" lines with status \"Unpaid\":\n- Purchase20231231009: 60,000.00 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231013: 250,000.00 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231015: 80,000.00 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase20231231018: 60,000.00 (Unpaid)\n\nTotal \"Purchases Unpaid\" = 60,000 + 250,000 + 80,000 + 60,000 = **450,000.00** (Accounts Payable liability, but assets up by inventory)\n\nOther purchases are cash/bank, so assets go down (cash/bank), inventory up—no net effect.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Add profit from sales**\nSum up all \"profit\" fields from Sales lines (including \"Sale\" lines only):\n\nRead through data, sum all \"profit\" values from sales.\n\nLet's sum them:\n\n#### **Profit calculation:**\nLet's process each \"Sale\" row for \"profit\":\n\n(Will total up \"Profit\" field from all Sale rows.
