Only the cash outflows for fixed asset purchases after opening matter.\n\n### Final Step: Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\n**Net Increase = Inflows - Outflows**\n\n12,063,234.64 - 4,380,978.88 = **7,682,255.76**\n\nBut this would be the net \"increase\" if *ALL* cash flows (since opening) are considered and cash outflows for all periods are subtracted from all inflows.  \nBUT The question asks for \"Net Increase\": usually this is (closing cash - opening cash).  \nGiven all cash movements after the initial deposit (so, not including the initial 8,000,000), Net Increase is:\n\nNet Increase = (Total Cash In from sales) - (Total Paid purchases, assets, expenses)\n\n4,063,234.64 - (2,570,000.00 + 676,195.87 + 1,134,783.01)  \n4,063,234.64 - 4,380,978.88  \n= **-317,744.24**\n\nHowever, if using the _change_ from opening cash, we must also consider that the opening cash establishes the \"base\": and any NEW inflows/outflows after that base affect Net Increase, which is negative, as calculated.\n\nBut the opening balances are the start of the cash flow.  \nIf the task is as usual in cash flow statements (Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents during the period), only cash movements after the opening balances should be included.\n\nTherefore, the _net increase in cash and cash equivalents_ is:\n\n**Net Increase = (Total Cash Received: Sales) - (All Outflows: Purchases, Fixed Assets, Expenses paid)**\n**= -317,744.24**\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"-317744.24\"} }\n```",
