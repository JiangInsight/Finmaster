For the cash flow statement, the beginning is what was \"on hand\" at the start, i.e., the sum of the cash and cash equivalents raised or owned as of 2023-12-31.\n\n**We do NOT deduct asset purchases, purchases paid, or expenses on the same day from the beginning balance.** These are reflected in the cash movements during the period, but not in the \"beginning\" balance used in the cash flow statement.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nSo, the **Beginning Cash and Cash Equivalents Balance** is:\n\n**8,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\"} }\n```",
