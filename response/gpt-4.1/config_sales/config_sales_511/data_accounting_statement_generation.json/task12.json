Understanding the Task\n\nAccounts Payable (A/P) refers to the amount owed by a company to its suppliers for purchases made on credit and not yet paid for at the balance sheet date.\n\n- **Accounts Payable Initial Value** – The value of outstanding payables at the starting point (here, after the initial entries, likely 0 unless stated).\n- **Accounts Payable End Value** – The sum of the outstanding amounts still unpaid at the latest date, considering only those marked as \"Unpaid\" for purchases.\n\n## 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n### Step 1: Find Initial Accounts Payable\n\nLooking at all \"Initial\" entries, none represent payables:\n\n| ... | type           | ... | amount     | ... | payment/receipt_status | payment_method   | ...\n|-----|----------------|-----|------------|-----|-----------------------|------------------|----\n| ... | Cash deposit   | ... | 3000000    | ... |                       |                  | ...\n| ... | Bank deposit   | ... | 5000000    | ... |                       |                  | ...\n| ... | Fixed Assets   | ... | 5000000    | ... |                       |                  | ...\n\nThey just record starting cash/bank/fixed asset balances.  \n**No initial accounts payable → Initial Accounts Payable = 0.00**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find Purchases Recorded as \"Unpaid\" (A/P increases)\n\nNow, go through all **Purchase** entries with \"payment/receipt_status\" = \"Unpaid\" (Account Payable).\n\nLet's pick ONLY those.\n\n#### Reviewing Purchases:\n\n| id                  | type     | date       | amount     | payment/receipt_status | payment_method    | ... |\n|---------------------|----------|------------|------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-----|\n| Purchase20231231009 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 60000.0    | Unpaid                | Account Payable   | ... |\n| Purchase20231231013 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 250000.0   | Unpaid                | Account Payable   | ... |\n| Purchase20231231015 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 80000.0    | Unpaid                | Account Payable   | ... |\n| Purchase20231231018 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 60000.0    | Unpaid                | Account Payable   | ... |\n\nAll other purchase entries are \"Paid\".\n\n### Step 3: Sum Unpaid Purchases\n\nSum the amounts of these unpaid purchases:\n\n- Purchase20231231009: 60,000.00\n- Purchase20231231013: 250,000.00\n- Purchase20231231015: 80,000.00\n- Purchase20231231018: 60,000.00\n\n**Total Accounts Payable at end = 60,000 + 250,000 + 80,000 + 60,000 = 450,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Did Any of These Get Paid Later?\n\nCheck if any purchase with the same supplier+product+amount was paid later. However, all payments made are for other purchases and none reference these \"Unpaid\" entries or \"payment/receipt_status\" as \"Paid\" for same amount for these records.\n\n**Therefore, all remain unpaid.**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Answer Format\n\nAccording to the specification, supply the result in:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accounts Payable End Value': '450000.00'} }\n```\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accounts Payable End Value': '450000.00'} }\n```",
