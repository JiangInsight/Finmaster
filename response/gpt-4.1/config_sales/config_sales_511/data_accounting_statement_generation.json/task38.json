Understand what to calculate\n\nIn Cash Flow Statements (Indirect Method), the adjustment \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is:\n\n- **increase in A/R** = cash outflow (subtract from profit)  \n- **decrease in A/R** = cash inflow (add to profit)  \n\nTo get this, we need:\n- Opening A/R (accounts receivable) at the beginning of the period (2023-12-31)\n- Closing A/R at the end of the period (2024-01-27, last date present)\n- Their difference: Closing - Opening\n\nBut if Opening A/R = 0, then (Increase/Decrease) = Closing A/R\n\n- We'll only consider **Sales with \"Unpaid\" status** and \"Account Receivable\"/none as receiving method.\n\n## 2. Opening Accounts Receivable\n\nScan Initial balances and transactions as of 2023-12-31.\n\nLooking at data:\n- There are no sales with \"Unpaid\" status and \"Account Receivable\" on 2023-12-31.  \n> So **Opening A/R = 0**\n\n## 3. Closing Accounts Receivable\n\nSum all \"Unpaid\" sales up to 2024-01-27, which are not yet paid by then.\n\nLet's find all transactions with:\n- type = \"Sale\"\n- payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\"\n- and/or receive_method = \"Account Receivable\" or missing\n- date <= 2024-01-27\n\nWe'll list them, then sum 'amount':\n\n---\n\n#### 2024-01-05\n| id           | Sale | ... | Unpaid | Account Receivable | 34779.88 |\n#### 2024-01-07\n| Sale20240107027 | 179351.74 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n| Sale20240107028 | 38713.3 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n| Sale20240107030 | 29132.13 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n#### 2024-01-10\n| Sale20240110039 | 97773.37 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n| Sale20240110040 | 85124.14 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n| Sale20240110041 | 17440.81 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n#### 2024-01-14\n| Sale20240114057 | 268702.8 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n| Sale20240114058 | 59318.97 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n#### 2024-01-15\n| Sale20240115063 | 75010.42 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n#### 2024-01-21\n| Sale20240121085 | 17812.71 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n#### 2024-01-24\n| Sale20240124094 | 171957.0 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n| Sale20240124095 | 97831.72 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n#### 2024-01-25\n| Sale20240125099 | 39867.96 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n#### 2024-01-26\n| Sale20240126105 | 289537.89 | Unpaid | Account Receivable\n\nLet's check if I missed any:\n\n- There are other sales with \"Unpaid\", but all do have \"Account Receivable\" payment/receipt_status.\n\nNow, sum all **Unpaid \"Sale\" transactions** (ensure not already paid & with Account Receivable or blank receive_method):\n\n## List sequenced by date:\n\n- 2024-01-05: 34,779.88\n- 2024-01-07: 179,351.74\n- 2024-01-07: 38,713.3\n- 2024-01-07: 29,132.13\n- 2024-01-10: 97,773.37\n- 2024-01-10: 85,124.14\n- 2024-01-10: 17,440.81\n- 2024-01-14: 268,702.8\n- 2024-01-14: 59,318.97\n- 2024-01-15: 75,010.42\n- 2024-01-21: 17,812.71\n- 2024-01-24: 171,957.0\n- 2024-01-24: 97,831.72\n- 2024-01-25: 39,867.96\n- 2024-01-26: 289,537.89\n\n**Now, sum up:**\n\nLet's do this:\n\n1. 34,779.88 +\n2. 179,351.74 = 214,131.62\n3. 38,713.3 = 252,844.92\n4. 29,132.13 = 281,977.05\n5. 97,773.37 = 379,750.42\n6. 85,124.14 = 464,874.56\n7. 17,440.81 = 482,315.37\n8. 268,702.8 = 751,018.17\n9. 59,318.97 = 810,337.14\n10. 75,010.42= 885,347.56\n11. 17,812.71= 903,160.27\n12. 171,957.0 =1,075,117.27\n13. 97,831.72 =1,172,948.99\n14. 39,867.96 =1,212,816.95\n15. 289,537.89=1,502,354.84\n\n### Final total: \n\n**Closing Accounts Receivable = 1,502,354.84**\n\n## 4. Calculation of (Increase) Decrease\n\nSince opening A/R = 0, closing = 1,502,354.84\n\nSo,\n> (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable = -(1,502,354.84) (i.e., negative, itâ€™s an increase, reduce from profit)\n\n## 5.
