Define the Components of \"Total Cost\" for an Income Statement\n\n**Total Cost** in the income statement typically includes:\n- Cost of goods sold (purchases of inventory/stock that relates to goods sold)\n- Sales Expenses (selling & distribution)\n- Administrative Expenses (office/admin)\n- Financial Expenses (interest, bank fees, etc.)\n- Depreciation\n\n**Exclude:**\n- Purchases of fixed assets (do not include as direct cost, only their depreciation counts)\n- Interest Receivables and similar income items\n- Sales (income side)\n- Transfers, deposits\n\n### 2. Extract and Sum Amounts by Type\n\nWe'll sum all items in:\n- Purchases (inventory/stock only, not fixed assets)\n- Expense (Sales Expenses + Admin Expenses + Financial Expenses)\n- Depreciation\n\n#### 2.1 Purchases (inventory/stock)\n\nFilter only purchase transactions that are inventory/stock, not \"Fixed Asset\" purchases.\n\nFrom data, matching `\"Purchase\"` but **not** if \"Fixed Assets\" or similar in product_name or asset_type.\n\nLet me list and sum all \"Purchase\" amounts for inventory:\n\n| id                       | type      | amount    | product_name
