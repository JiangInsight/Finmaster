What is Paid-in Capital?\nPaid-in capital represents the capital invested by shareholders in exchange for shares of the company; basically, the owner's equity from initial and subsequent investments by owners/shareholders.  \n**It only increases (or sometimes decreases) when new capital is injected (or returned).**  \n**Ordinary transactions like purchases, sales, expenses, etc., do NOT affect paid-in capital.**\n\n## 2. Review Transactions for Paid-in Capital\nFrom the transaction data:\n- **Paid-in capital is usually recorded at company establishment (initial investment), often as \"Initial...\" entries such as \"Cash deposit,\" \"Bank deposit,\" and \"Fixed Assets.\"**\n- All other transactions (sales, purchases, expenses) only affect profits and other asset/liability accounts, NOT paid-in capital.\n\n### Identify All Paid-in Capital Entries:\nLook at the very top rows:\n```\n| Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit      | ... | 3000000.0 |\n| Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit      | ... | 5000000.0 |\n| Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets      | ... | 5000000.0 |\n```\nTotal initial capital = 3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 = **13,000,000.0**\n\n**No further 'Initial', 'Capital injection', or 'Paid-in capital' entries are seen after these.**\n\n## 3. Check for Changes to Paid-in Capital\n- No new capital injections.\n- No capital withdrawals (redemptions).\n\n## 4. Solution Formatting\nThe paid-in capital is unchanged throughout the period.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"13000000.00\"} }\n```",
