We'll pick up the date and amount, customer, and check the relevant columns.\n\n### Go through each line in the table and add up all Unpaid Sale rows:\n\n#### 2024-01-05\n- | Sale20240105015 | Sale | 2024-01-05 | ... | 34779.88 | ... | Unpaid | ... |  Account Receviable | ... |\n\n#### 2024-01-07\n- | Sale20240107027 | Sale | ... | 179351.74 | ... | Unpaid | ... |  Account Receviable |\n- | Sale20240107028 | Sale | ... | 38713.3 | ... | Unpaid | ... |  Account Receviable |\n- | Sale20240107030 | Sale | ... | 29132.13 | ... | Unpaid | ... |  Account Receviable |\n\n#### 2024-01-10\n- | Sale20240110039 | Sale | ... | 97773.37 | ... | Unpaid | ... |  Account Receviable |\n- | Sale20240110040 | Sale | ... | 85124.14 | ... | Unpaid | ... |  Account Receviable |\n- | Sale20240110041 | Sale | ... | 17440.81 | ... | Unpaid | ... |  Account Receviable |\n\n#### 2024-01-14\n- | Sale20240114057 | Sale | ... | 268702.8 | ... | Unpaid | ... |  Account Receviable |\n- | Sale20240114058 | Sale | ... | 59318.97 | ... | Unpaid | ... |  Account Receviable |\n\n#### 2024-01-15\n- | Sale20240115063 | Sale | ... | 75010.42 | ... | Unpaid | ... |  Account Receviable |\n\n#### 2024-01-21\n- | Sale20240121085 | Sale | ... | 17812.71 | ... | Unpaid | ... |  Account Receviable |\n\n#### 2024-01-24\n- | Sale20240124094 | Sale | ... | 171957.0 | ... | Unpaid | ... |  Account Receviable |\n- | Sale20240124095 | Sale | ... | 97831.72 | ... | Unpaid | ... |  Account Receviable |\n\n#### 2024-01-25\n- | Sale20240125099 | Sale | ... | 39867.96 | ... | Unpaid | ... |  Account Receviable |\n\n#### 2024-01-26\n- | Sale20240126105 | Sale | ... | 289537.89 | ... | Unpaid | ... |  Account Receviable |\n\nNow, check for any \"Sale\" lines with Unpaid status but where \"receive_method\" indicates \"Account Receviable\" or for which conditions clearly indicate it's AR.\n\n### Explicit list from parsed input:\nLet's enumerate all AR relevant sales:\n\n| Date         | Sale ID         | Amount      |\n|--------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| 2024-01-05   | Sale20240105015 |   34,779.88 |\n| 2024-01-07   | Sale20240107027 |  179,351.74 |\n| 2024-01-07   | Sale20240107028 |   38,713.30 |\n| 2024-01-07   | Sale20240107030 |   29,132.13 |\n| 2024-01-10   | Sale20240110039 |   97,773.37 |\n| 2024-01-10   | Sale20240110040 |   85,124.14 |\n| 2024-01-10   | Sale20240110041 |   17,440.81 |\n| 2024-01-14   | Sale20240114057 |  268,702.80 |\n| 2024-01-14   | Sale20240114058 |   59,318.97 |\n| 2024-01-15   | Sale20240115063 |   75,010.42 |\n| 2024-01-21   | Sale20240121085 |   17,812.71 |\n| 2024-01-24   | Sale20240124094 |  171,957.00 |\n| 2024-01-24   | Sale20240124095 |   97,831.72 |\n| 2024-01-25   | Sale20240125099 |   39,867.96 |\n| 2024-01-26   | Sale20240126105 |  289,537.89 |\n\n### Step 4: Sum All Accounts Receivable Increases\nPerform the addition:\n\n- 34,779.88\n- 179,351.74\n- 38,713.30\n- 29,132.13\n- 97,773.37\n- 85,124.14\n- 17,440.81\n- 268,702.80\n- 59,318.97\n- 75,010.42\n- 17,812.71\n- 171,957.00\n- 97,831.72\n- 39,867.96\n- 289,537.89\n\n**Sum:**  \nLet's add these up step by step.\n\n34,779.88 \\\n+179,351.74 = 214,131.62 \\\n+38,713.30 = 252,844.92 \\\n+29,132.13 = 281,977.05 \\\n+97,773.37 = 379,750.42 \\\n+85,124.14 = 464,874.56 \\\n+17,440.81 = 482,315.37 \\\n+268,702.80 = 751,018.17 \\\n+59,318.97 = 810,337.14 \\\n+75,010.42 = 885,347.56 \\\n+17,812.71 = 903,160.27 \\\n+171,957.00 = 1,075,117.27 \\\n+97,831.72 = 1,172,948.99 \\\n+39,867.96 = 1,212,816.95 \\\n+289,537.89 = 1,502,354.84\n\n**Final sum:** 1,502,354.84\n\nPrecision check: It's best to compute in steps with a calculator for guaranteed accuracy:\n\n 34,779.88  \n+179,351.74 = 214,131.62  \n+ 38,713.30 = 252,844.92  \n+ 29,132.13 = 281,977.05  \n+ 97,773.37 = 379,750.42  \n+ 85,124.14 = 464,874.56  \n+ 17,440.81 = 482,315.37  \n+268,702.80 = 751,018.17  \n+ 59,318.97 = 810,337.14  \n+ 75,010.42 = 885,347.56  \n+ 17,812.71 = 903,160.27  \n+171,957.00 = 1,075,117.27  \n+ 97,831.72 = 1,172,948.99  \n+ 39,867.96 = 1,212,816.95  \n+289,537.89 = 1,502,354.84\n\n### Step 5: Confirm There Are No Decreases (Cash Collections)\nBased on this dataset, there are no sales with partial collections against earlier ARs, nor payment records from customers specifying AR settlement.
