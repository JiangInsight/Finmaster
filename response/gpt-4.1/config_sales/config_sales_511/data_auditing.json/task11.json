This is inconsistent and points to an error in record separating or ID assignment.\n2. There are **multiple cost_per_unit fields filled** for sales (\"Sale20240102002\", etc.) where they either should be blank or derived (and sometimes the value is duplicated). However, since invoice description matches, this may be just a duplicate info field.\n3. For **Expense...15001** and **...25001**, in one case, the recorded_preparer is blank, but the invoice says who prepared it (Supervisor for 15001, Staff for 25001).\n\n**Note:** Other fields (amount, unit price, cost, quantity) all match what would be inferred from the invoice descriptions (multiplying units and unit price), so no further errors are found in those rows.\n\nIf a more exhaustive cross-check of every field/content is needed, I can expand furtherâ€”let me know!",
