Here, the correct quantity should be 2.0 and amount should thus be $188,177.44, but the recorded amount is only for one unit.\n- Other fields (like payment/receipt_status, method, customer, etc.) all align, but the key category and quantity do not.\n- Therefore, in this case, the correct values (from the invoice) are:\n  - category: Sale (should be recorded as sale, not depreciation)\n  - quantity: 2.0\n\nOther fields do not show internal inconsistency compared to the invoice data for the remaining lines.",
