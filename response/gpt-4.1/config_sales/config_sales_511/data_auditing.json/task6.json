Particular attention is paid to transactions with unit prices or amounts that do not reconcile with the invoice or with calculated totals.\n2. **Highlight: Sale20240107029**\n   - The invoice states: \"...a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $18296.79, totaling $18296.79...\"\n   - But in the recorded fields: product_id is P002 (Premium Product B), recorded_product_name is \"Premium Product B\", recorded_quantity is 1.0, but recorded_unit_price is **16946.23** (does not match the invoice or the calculation: 1 * 16946.23 = 16946.23). The total recorded_amount is **18296.79**, matching the invoice.\n   - Thus, the recorded_unit_price is inconsistent with the actual sale and should be **18296.79** (from the invoice and the total).\n   - The issue is isolated to the recorded_unit_price.\n3. **No other clear inconsistencies found:** All other entries appear to reconcile between invoice and data fields. (There may be duplications/repeat entries or field order differences, but they're not \"internal inconsistencies\" in the values themselves.)\n4. **Populate solution:** Following instructions, fill out only the fields that have an error; leave other fields as null/None.\n\n**Note:** If you wish to analyze deeper for things like repeated use of same asset id with different amounts (which may indicate data issues, asset id design, or allowed aggregation splits), or e.g., roles (supervisor vs. senior staff), let me know for more advanced reconciliation criteria. This answer only addresses clear internal inconsistencies per your direct task and template!",
