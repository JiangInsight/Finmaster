Based on standard accounting system logic, the correct data is to have three different transaction IDs, each with distinct type and amount, as per their invoices.\n\n- However, *within a record set per ID*, if the invoice states \"Cash deposit\", then all `recorded_type` should also be \"Cash deposit\", not \"Bank deposit\" or \"Fixed Assets\". The amounts should match the invoice.\n\n- Therefore, these entries are internally inconsistent in both the `recorded_type` and `recorded_amount`.\n\n**Note**: The rest of the records in your problem align with their invoice fields, except for similar copy-paste/ID reuse cases. If you wish to review further entries or want a full listing for all other cases (e.g., as in the second sample with mismatched payment methods), please clarify if you want the *full scan* output or just all major issues.\n\n*For above, I provide two distinct output blocks for the reused transaction ID (as per example format). If you want more expanded reporting (i.e., for every mismatch in your input), let me know!*",
