This isn't necessarily an error if these are sub-components of an initial capital entry, but should be flagged if only one initial entry per ID is valid.\n- For `Sale20240105015`, the date and unit price in the invoice (\"On January 05, 2024, ... $34779.88\") disagrees with the recorded `recorded_date` (\"2024-01-25\") and `recorded_unit_price` (\"34747.5\"). The invoice (considered more reliable) indicates the true date and correct unit price should be \"2024-01-05\" and \"34779.88\" respectively.\n- For `Sale20240121035`, per the risk_issues, the invoice states a unit price of 134289.80 and a date of \"2024-01-21\", whereas the recorded row gives 135477.71 and date \"2024-01-30\". The invoice is likely correct, so original values should be those from the invoice.\n- All other entries are internally consistent or do not have clear discrepancies between the invoice/narrative and the recorded values. \n\n**Note**: Other fields not shown (such as payment method, quantity, cost, etc.) are consistent between the data and invoice. Only the listed fields above per case have mismatches. If there should be more entries based on other discrepancies in other rows, please clarify, but based on the presented risk_issues and standard process, these are the main entries with internal inconsistencies.",
