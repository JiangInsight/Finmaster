The cost amount for this transaction was $50000.00, with a tax amount of $4885.15, leading to a total amount due of $92817.81.\"\n- But the row has: quantity 0.0, price 94678.46, amount 118558.82, tax 83038.84.\n- All these fields are inconsistent with the invoice.\n- The corrected values from the invoice should be: quantity 1.0, unit price 97702.96, amount 97702.96, tax 4885.15.\n- Only these four fields have internal inconsistencies based on the invoice and other fields.\n\nNo other rows in the presented \"problem\" block have obvious inconsistencies when compared to their invoice description. If you need the inconsistencies for more rows, please clarify!",
