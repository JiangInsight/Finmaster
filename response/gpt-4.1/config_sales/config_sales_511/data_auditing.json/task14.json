The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n- The recorded row has: quantity as 2.0 (should be 3.0), amount as 179135.20 (should be 268702.80), payment/receipt_status as Paid (should be Unpaid), but unit price is correct. \n- Therefore, the inconsistent fields and their best estimations are listed above.",
