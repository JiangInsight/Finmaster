Sale20240121084\n\n- **Recorded category:** Purchase\n- **Invoice description (\"On January 21, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $85459.24, totaling $85459.24...\")** → Indicates that the **original should be \"Sale\"**, not \"Purchase\".\n- **recorded_product_name:** Premium Product D, quantity 1.0, recorded_unit_price 90526.16, but invoice lists sale at 85459.24.\n- **recorded_amount:** 85459.24. Invoice and recorded_amount match on this.\n- **Discrepant field(s) (relative to invoice):**\n    - recorded_type/category: Should be \"Sale\"\n    - recorded_unit_price: Should be 85459.24 (to match the amount and 1.0 quantity)\n    - The rest (approver, preparer, etc.) fits the invoice or is empty as expected.\n\n#### 2. The rest of the transactions do not present internal inconsistency within a single transaction (unit price * quantity = amount, invoiced descriptions match transaction lines, fields such as status, payment method, etc. are all reasonable given the content).\n\n#### 3. No other transaction presents a field—in terms of invoice, amount, and details—that is in contradiction with itself or the invoice summary.\n\n**Thus, only Sale20240121084 is internally inconsistent and should be flagged as above.**",
