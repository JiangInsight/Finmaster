The cost amount for this transaction was $5000.00, with a tax amount of $461.49, leading to a total amount due of $8768.36. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"  \n- **Step 2: Compare category/type:**  \n  - In `recorded_type` column: \"Administrative Expenses\"  \n  - In invoice and transaction context, it is actually a \"Sale\"  \n  → *Inconsistency: Category/Type*\n- **Step 3: Compare receive/payment method:**  \n  - In table: `recorded_receive_method` = \"Account Receivable\"  \n  - In invoice: \"The receive_method of this transaction was cash\"  \n  → *Inconsistency: Receive method*\n- **Step 4: Double-check other fields (approver, preparer, amount, quantity, etc):**  \n  The rest agree or are N/A for invoice.  \n- **Step 5: Output all mismatched fields as per the requested template.**\n\n**Thus, the main inconsistencies are:**\n- The category/type should be \"Sale,\" not \"Administrative Expenses\"\n- The receive method should be \"Cash,\" not \"Account Receivable\"\n- All other major fields, including quantity, unit price/amount, tax, etc., match the invoice.\n\n*Note: For fields where the invoice lacked data or did not differ, null is used in the output according to the instructions.*",
