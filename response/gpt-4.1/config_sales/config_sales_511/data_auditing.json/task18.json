Recorded quantity, profit, and payment/receipt_status do not match: an amount of 0.0 with quantity 0 and Unpaid status, but the invoice (trusted) says 1 unit, amount 19969.83, paid. Profit is lower than should be (19969.83-10000 = 9969.83).\",\n    \"Estimated correct values\": {\n      \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n      \"Recorded quantity\": 1.0,\n      \"Recorded amount\": 19969.83,\n      \"Recorded profit\": 9969.83\n    }\n  }\n]}\n```\n\n**(Explanation: Only these entries show cross-field errors or mismatches based on the invoiceâ€”the rest are either consistent in value, or if multiple records for a given id (such as expense breakdowns), are supported by the narration in the invoice. The first item represents the typical initial entry confusion often seen in trial balance imports, and the second is a sale entry with mismatches between fields and the invoice.) If you want further inconsistencies checked, please specify additional rows.**",
