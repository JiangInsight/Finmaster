We want to see if any calculated or key fields do not match what the invoice (narrative) says.\n2. **Look for mismatches in calculation-based fields:** The profit should be \"amount - cost amount\", for sales, which the invoice supports.\n3. **Review the suspected problematic rows:**\n   - For `Sale20240107030`, the invoice says: \"an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 3.0 units at a unit price of $9710.71, totaling $29132.13. The cost amount for this transaction was $15000.00...\". So: 29132.13 - 15000.00 = **14132.13**.\n   - However, the 'recorded_profit' field is `10874.38`.\n4. **Conclude:** The only inconsistency in the given rows is in this profit field. The other entries match their narratives or formulas according to the invoice.\n\n**Thus the returned solution field above, with only the relevant fields filled for the profit discrepancy row (id: Sale20240107030).**",
