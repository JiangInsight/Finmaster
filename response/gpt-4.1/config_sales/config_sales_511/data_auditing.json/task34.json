Table lists only 17472.47.\n- **Tax:** Invoice (and math for 2 units) gives 1747.25, but table says 39188.72 (completely off).\n- **Profit:** Invoice gives total profit as 14944.94 (34944.94 - 20000 cost?); record field blank.\n- **Preparer/Approver:** Not given, so kept as null.\n\n**All expected/correct values can be drawn from the standardized invoice description, which is always trusted over possible misentry in table fields.**",
