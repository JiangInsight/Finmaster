Initial20231231001 – Split of Opening Balances\n- There are three rows with the same ID (Initial20231231001) but different categories and amounts (Cash deposit 3,000,000; Bank deposit 5,000,000; Fixed Assets 5,000,000).\n- The sum of Cash+Bank exceeds the Fixed Assets amount; but the invoices record each separately. If these are just expanded splits from a single, total opening entry, it's a split, which is not a genuine error (but may be an artifact of entry). Flagging for clarity.\n- **Estimated correct value:** May just be three opening categories. If original ledger had only one split between cash and bank of total assets, splitting as three is a possible design choice, but warrants clarification.\n\n### 2. Interest20240110010 – Amount and Status Error\n- The invoice reads: \"...an invoice was issued for Interest Receivables totaling $330.29. ...the receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n- **Recorded amount:** 377.27, **invoice amount:** 330.29\n- **Recorded payment/receipt_status:** Paid, **invoice says:** unpaid\n- This is a real error:\n    - The \"Original amount\" should be 330.29, not 377.27.\n    - \"Original payment/receipt_status\" should be \"Unpaid\", not \"Paid\".\n\n### 3. Expense20240130001 – Administrative Expense Amount and Status Error\n- The last (example) entry states:\n    - Invoice: \"totaling $32705.96. ...this transaction was paid.\"\n    - **Recorded amount:** 37712.1, **recorded status:** Unpaid.\n    - Should be: Amount 32705.96, status Paid.\n\n**There may be other errors (e.g. inconsistent cost/unit calculation); however, based on supplied invoice texts, these three are direct, invoice-against-record mismatches, and the opening split may be restructured but not false per se.**",
