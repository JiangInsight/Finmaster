The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $1761.05, leading to a total amount due of $33459.87. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- The field `recorded_tax_amount` is **29068.34**, but the invoice description (usually most reliable) says tax is **1761.05**.\n- All other fields (amount, quantity, price, cost, etc.) match the invoice.\n- Therefore, there is an internal inconsistency between the recorded and the reliable (invoice-stated) tax for this row.\n- All other fields match or are not in concern.",
