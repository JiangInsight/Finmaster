The cost amount ... tax amount of $8,597.85, leading to a total amount due of $163,359.15. ...\"\n- However, the table records `recorded_unit_price` as 69347.48, and `recorded_amount` as 197,405.74.\n- Based on the invoice, which is standardized and likely accurate, the unit price should be 85,978.5, and total amount should be 171,957.\n- Thus, fields with inconsistencies: `recorded_unit_price`, `recorded_amount`, `recorded_date`.\n- Original values are taken from the invoice description.\n- Recorded values taken from table.\n- Other fields (preparer, approver, payment/receipt status, etc.) are either missing or match, or not referenced in the invoice.\n\nIf more discrepancies existed, they would each have a similar entry in the array. Here, only the one transaction (Sale20240124094) has internal inconsistencies based on invoice.",
