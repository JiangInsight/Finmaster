The current recording swapped to Administrative Expenses and updated the date and amount.\n- So, the incorrect fields (inconsistencies) are: **category/type, date, and amount**.\n- All other fields appear to match or are consistent/not given (preparer, approver, payment/receipt_status are missing in both or match).\n- The best estimate for the correct values uses the invoice: **category=Sale**, **date=2024-01-10**, **amount=17,440.81**.\n- This matches the expected format.\n",
