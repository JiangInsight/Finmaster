We'll track:\n\n- **Initial cash/bank balances**: Start of period\n- **Cash inflows**: Only 'Paid' sales in cash (method blank or cash-like), ignore unpaid/account receivable sales, interest is \"unpaid\" so not cash\n- **Cash outflows**: Purchases/expenses/bank transfer actually paid by cash or equivalents\n- **Ignore**: Anything \"Unpaid\" (no cash effect yet), \"Account Payable/Receivable\", pure interest/accruals, non-cash depreciation\n\n#### 1. Initial Balance\n- Cash deposit:             **3,000,000.00**\n- Bank deposit:             **5,000,000.00** (total initial = **8,000,000.00**)\n- Simultaneous asset: Fixed assets (non-cash) entry, ignore for cash\n\n**Start: 8,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n#### 2.

Let's check for forgot bank transfers (cash to bank, not to supplier) and see if there are such.\n\n#### 6. Adjust for \"Bank Transfer\" (inter-cash movement)\n\nIf there were \"cash to bank\" transfer outflows as in your example, that reduces cash, increases bank (within cash equiv.)\n\nIn your **example**, bank transfer between cash & bank were considered (from the detailed table), but in this problem, such lines seem to be only between expenses/purchases/sales mix. Given the data, we see no explicit \"cash to bank\" transfer reducing almost every day.\n\n**But \"paid\" purchases via bank transfer decrease cash equivalents (still total cash+bank).**\n\nAs per cash & cash equivalent (not just cash, but \"bank\" as equivalent) - so both balances together.\n\n#### 7. Conclusion\nSo our calculation matches the procedure in your example. The computed number seems plausible as a total cash and cash equivalents ending balance.\n\n#### 8. Double check for unlisted outflows\n\nFor completeness, let's check if any bank transfer \"cash to bank\" (like in example) is listed in this table. I cannot see explicit such lines. Thus, our cash equivalents is just total; purchases by \"bank transfer\" reduce total.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"1009838.98\"} }\n```\n\n--- \n\n#### **Note:**\nIf you want only the *cash* part, not cash+bank, youâ€™d need to separate sources; this output, like in your example, is **total cash and cash equivalents (cash+bank) at end of period**. \n\nYou may want to double-check individual entries in case of typos in copy/paste, but this computation template is 100% methodologically transparent and matches your provided style.",
