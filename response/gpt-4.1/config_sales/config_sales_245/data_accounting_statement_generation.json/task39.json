Understanding the Task\n\nYou have a transaction listing that includes several entries of \"Interest Receivables\" and are asked to determine the “(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable” for a cash flow statement.\n\n#### Principle:\n- The cash flow adjustment is the change in the Interest Receivable account during the period.\n- Formula:\n  \\[\n  (\\text{Increase}) \\text{Decrease in Interest Receivable} = \\text{Interest Receivable at the end} - \\text{Interest Receivable at the beginning}\n  \\]\n  - If receivable increases, it subtracts from operating cash flow (shows as negative).\n  - If receivable decreases, it adds to operating cash flow (shows as positive).\n- For this task, sum only the *unpaid* \"Interest Receivables\" for each date, to determine the amount accrued but not yet received at each date.\n\n### 2. Find Opening and Closing Balances\n\n#### Starting Point:\n- The initial balance on 2023-12-31 is not directly given, but since the first transaction for \"Interest Receivables\" is on 2024-01-01, we may assume zero unless specified. Let's continue with '0' as opening.\n\n#### Extract All Interest Receivable Transactions:\n(Exclude any that don't say \"Interest Receivables\" or are not unpaid; in this data, all IR entries appear to be accruals not cash receipts.)\n\n| Date         | Amount         |\n|--------------|---------------|\n| 2024-01-01   | 427.2         |\n| 2024-01-02   | 376.47        |\n| 2024-01-03   | 376.47        |\n| 2024-01-04   | 358.67        |\n| 2024-01-05   | 358.67        |\n| 2024-01-06   | 358.67        |\n| 2024-01-07   | 358.67        |\n| 2024-01-08   | 358.67        |\n| 2024-01-09   | 358.67        |\n| 2024-01-10   | 358.67        |\n| 2024-01-11   | 346.21        |\n| 2024-01-12   | 346.21        |\n| 2024-01-13   | 346.21        |\n| 2024-01-14   | 335.53        |\n| 2024-01-15   | 335.53        |\n| 2024-01-16   | 335.53        |\n| 2024-01-17   | 335.53        |\n| 2024-01-18   | 335.53        |\n| 2024-01-19   | 335.53        |\n| 2024-01-20   | 335.53        |\n| 2024-01-21   | 335.53        |\n| 2024-01-22   | 334.195       |\n| 2024-01-23   | 334.195       |\n| 2024-01-24   | 334.195       |\n| 2024-01-25   | 334.195       |\n| 2024-01-26   | 325.295       |\n| 2024-01-27   | 325.295       |\n| 2024-01-28   | 325.295       |\n| 2024-01-29   | 325.295       |\n\n#### Opening Balance (2023-12-31): 0\n\n#### Closing Balance (2024-01-29): Cumulative sum as of 2024-01-29\n\n### 3. Calculate the Cumulative Amount\n\nLet's sum all the above amounts:\n\n```\n427.2\n+ 376.47\n+ 376.47\n+ 358.67\n+ 358.67\n+ 358.67\n+ 358.67\n+ 358.67\n+ 358.67\n+ 358.67\n+ 346.21\n+ 346.21\n+ 346.21\n+ 335.53\n+ 335.53\n+ 335.53\n+ 335.53\n+ 335.53\n+ 335.53\n+ 335.53\n+ 335.53\n+ 334.195\n+ 334.195\n+ 334.195\n+ 334.195\n+ 325.295\n+ 325.295\n+ 325.295\n+ 325.295\n```\n\nLet's sum step-by-step:\n\nFirst, count how many successive same amounts:\n\n- 2024-01-01: 427.2\n- 2024-01-02, 2024-01-03: 2 × 376.47 = 752.94\n- 2024-01-04 to 2024-01-10: 7 × 358.67 = 2510.69\n- 2024-01-11 to 2024-01-13: 3 × 346.21 = 1038.63\n- 2024-01-14 to 2024-01-21: 8 × 335.53 = 2684.24\n- 2024-01-22 to 2024-01-25: 4 × 334.195 = 1336.78\n- 2024-01-26 to 2024-01-29: 4 × 325.295 = 1301.18\n\nNow sum:\n\n427.2  \n+ 752.94  \n+ 2510.69  \n+ 1038.63  \n+ 2684.24  \n+ 1336.78  \n+ 1301.18  \n= ?\n\nLet's add cumulatively:\n\n427.2 + 752.94 = 1180.14  \n+ 2510.69 = 3690.83  \n+ 1038.63 = 4729.46  \n+ 2684.24 = 7413.70  \n+ 1336.78 = 8750.48  \n+ 1301.18 = 10051.66  \n\n### 4. (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\n\n\\[\n10051.66 - 0 = 10051.66\n\\]\n\nSince it's an *increase* in interest receivable (from 0 to 10051.66), this is shown as negative in the cash flow statement:\n\n\\[\n(\\text{Increase}) \\text{Decrease in Interest Receivable}: \\boxed{-10051.66}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-10051.66\"}}\n```",
