                        "content": "Let's analyze step by step:\n\n## 1. What is Paid-in Capital?\nPaid-in Capital = Original capital invested into the business by its shareholders/owners; it doesn't change with operating transactions (sales, purchases, expenses, etc.), nor from interest or depreciation, unless there's a new capital injection or withdrawal by owners.\n\n## 2. Find Initial Paid-in Capital\nLook for the \"Initial\" entries (usually labeled so), and consider only those identifying capital contributions. Ignore subsequent operating transactions unless there is a noted increase/decrease to share capital (such as secondary capital contributions or capital withdrawals, which do NOT appear in the data given).\n\nFrom the data, the \"Initial\" capitalization is as follows:\n\n| id                | type           | amount      |\n|-------------------|----------------|-------------|\n| Initial20231231001| Cash deposit   | 3,000,000.0 |\n| Initial20231231001| Bank deposit   | 5,000,000.0 |\n| Initial20231231001| Fixed Assets   | 5,000,000.0 |\n\nSum:  \n3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 = **13,000,000.0**\n\n\n## 3. Check for Additional Capital Contributions or Withdrawals\nReview the rest of the transactions for any further capital contributions (look for \"Initial\", \"Additional Capital\", \"Investment\", or explicit shareholder withdrawals). There are **none**; all other entries are ordinary business operations.\n\n**All purchases, sales, expenses, depreciation, and interest transactions do not affect paid-in capital.**\n\n## 4. Paid-in Capital End Value\nPaid-in Capital remains the same at period-end unless there are additional investments or withdrawals, which there are not.\n\n## 5. Solution\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"13000000.00\"} }\n```\nThis matches the method shown in your example. All logical steps are complete and cross-verified.",
