Initial Total Assets\n\n### Find all initial entries:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Fixed assets: 5,000,000.00\n\n**Initial Assets = Cash + Bank + Fixed Assets = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Assets at End\n\nLet's categorize the major changes affecting the balance sheet:\n\n### Categories of Assets\n1. **Cash and Bank Deposits**: Start with initial sum, add receipts (sales received, interest received, etc.), subtract payments (purchases paid, operating expenses, etc.).\n2. **Inventory**: Initial inventory (purchases before 2024), add purchases, subtract cost of goods sold (COGS).\n3. **Fixed Assets**: Initial value less depreciation.\n4. **Accounts Receivable**: Sales that are unpaid.\n5. **Interest Receivable**: Cumulative interest receivable and net change.\n6. **Accounts Payable**: Purchases that are unpaid (we will treat as negative asset or liability for balancing only).\n\nLet's focus on the asset side: cash/bank, inventory, fixed assets (less depreciation), accounts receivable, interest receivable.\n\nWe will compute:\n- Fixed assets (ending)\n- Inventory (ending)\n- Cash + Bank (ending)\n- Accounts Receivable (ending)\n- Interest Receivable (ending)\n\n---\n\n### 2.1. Fixed Assets\n\n**Initial Fixed Assets**: 5,000,000.00\n\n**Depreciation entries:**\n- 2024-01-01: 45,757.71\n\nSo,\n**Ending Fixed Assets** = 5,000,000.00 - 45,757.71 = 4,954,242.29\n\n---\n\n### 2.2. Inventory\n\n**Purchases:**\n\nSum up all purchase entries (ignore initial entry since it is already included in initial inventory):\n\n| Entry                                         | Amount    | Paid Status     |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Purchase20231231001 Premium Product C         | 200,000   | Paid            |\n| Purchase20231231002 Premium Product D         | 500,000   | Paid            |\n| Purchase20231231003 Premium Product B         | 70,000    | Paid            |\n| Purchase20231231004 Premium Product B         | 100,000   | Paid            |\n| Purchase20231231005 Premium Product A         | 35,000    | Unpaid          |\n| Purchase20231231006 Premium Product D         | 200,000   | Paid            |\n| Purchase20231231007 Premium Product C         | 180,000   | Paid            |\n| Purchase20231231008 Premium Product B         | 30,000    | Paid            |\n| Purchase20231231009 Premium Product A         | 50,000    | Unpaid          |\n| Purchase20231231010 Premium Product C         | 140,000   | Paid            |\n| Purchase20231231011 Premium Product B         | 100,000   | Paid            |\n| Purchase20231231012 Premium Product A         | 35,000    | Unpaid          |\n| Purchase20231231013 Premium Product A         | 45,000    | Unpaid          |\n| Purchase20231231014 Premium Product D         | 400,000   | Unpaid          |\n| Purchase20231231015 Premium Product C         | 120,000   | Paid            |\n| Purchase20231231016 Premium Product D         | 200,000   | Paid            |\n| Purchase20231231017 Premium Product D         | 450,000   | Paid            |\n| Purchase20231231018 Premium Product B         | 90,000    | Unpaid          |\n| Purchase20231231019 Premium Product A         | 15,000    | Paid            |\n| Purchase20231231020 Premium Product A         | 30,000    | Unpaid          |\n| Purchase20231231021 Premium Product C         | 160,000   | Paid            |\n| Purchase20231231022 Premium Product D         | 350,000   | Paid            |\n| Purchase20231231023 Premium Product A         | 35,000    | Paid            |\n| Purchase20231231024 Premium Product B         | 100,000   | Paid            |\n| Purchase20231231025 Premium Product D         | 450,000   | Paid            |\n| Purchase20231231026 Premium Product C         | 140,000   | Unpaid          |\n\nNow sum all purchases for ending inventory calculation:\n\n**Total Purchases (sum up all):**\nLet's sum up only the purchase amounts.

All these purchases are after initial inventory of 2023-12-31, so per schedules, all purchases from 2023-12-31 are part of inventory. We need to account for Cost of Goods Sold (**COGS**).\n\n#### Cost of Goods Sold Calculation\n\nCOGS is the sum of \"cost_amount\" in each sale entry (from the table, only for items sold).\n\nSum cost_amount of **all sales**.\n\nFirst, let's identify all Sale entries and sum their cost_amounts:\n\nLet’s go step by step, identifying and summing all sale cost_amounts.\n\n(Extracting key fields
