What are \"Total Liabilities\" in Balance Sheet context?\nLiabilities are obligations the company needs to pay: \n- **Short term (current)**: e.g. “Accounts Payable”, unpaid Interest (“Interest Payables” only, but here Unpaid Interest Receivables usually belong to assets), loans.\n- **Long term**: e.g. long-term loans.\n\nBased on the data, the only direct liabilities we can find are from:\n- **Purchases marked \"Unpaid\"** (look for \"Account Payable\" or payment_status \"Unpaid\" in Purchase)\n- **Purchases** (paid = not a liability; unpaid = liability)\n- Ignore “Unpaid” on “Sale” lines: These are amounts OTHERS owe TO US (Accounts Receivable = asset, not a liability).\n- “Interest Receivables” unpaid: These are assets, **not liabilities**.\n\nSo, for the “Initial” liabilities: Look for any initial unpaid payables or loan items.  \nFor “Ending” liabilities: Sum up the value of purchases marked “Unpaid” and payment/receipt_status: “Unpaid” for purchases (and NOT for sales!)\n\n### 2. Identify Initial Liabilities\nIn the initial (Initial20231231001) entries:\n- Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed assets. No liabilities listed. (No loans, no payables.)\n\nSo:  \n**Initial liabilities = 0.00**\n\n### 3. Identify Final Liabilities\nGo through all transactions and sum up purchases marked as “Unpaid”.\n\nFind all purchase lines with \"Unpaid\", which are liabilities (Accounts Payable).\n\n#### List all purchase lines with \"Unpaid\":\nLet’s systematically go through all \"Purchase\" transactions with \"Unpaid\".  \nThey will look like:\n| ... | Purchase | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | Unpaid | ... | Account Payable | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\nNow, let's enumerate these (extracting amount):\n\n| id               | type     | date       | amount    | payment/receipt_status  | payment_method        | ...         |\n|------------------|----------|------------|-----------|------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| Purchase20231231005 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 35000.0   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable      | ...         |\n| Purchase20231231009 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 50000.0   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable      | ...         |\n| Purchase20231231012 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 35000.0   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable      | ...         |\n| Purchase20231231013 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 45000.0   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable      | ...         |\n| Purchase20231231014 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 400000.0  | Unpaid                 | Account Payable      | ...         |\n| Purchase20231231018 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 90000.0   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable      | ...         |\n| Purchase20231231020 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 30000.0   | Unpaid                 | Account Payable      | ...         |\n| Purchase20231231026 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 140000.0  | Unpaid                 | Account Payable      | ...         |\n\nSum the \"amount\" column above:\n\n- 35000.0\n- 50000.0\n- 35000.0\n- 45000.0\n- 400000.0\n- 90000.0\n- 30000.0\n- 140000.0\n\nLet's add them:\n- 35000.0 + 50000.0 = 85000.0\n- 85000.0 + 35000.0 = 120000.0\n- 120000.0 + 45000.0 = 165000.0\n- 165000.0 + 400000.0 = 565000.0\n- 565000.0 + 90000.0 = 655000.0\n- 655000.0 + 30000.0 = 685000.0\n- 685000.0 + 140000.0 = 825000.0\n\n**Total purchases unpaid (\"Account Payable\") at period end: 825,000.00**\n\n#### Are there other liabilities?\nCheck for other types in this dataset.\n- Purchases with \"Unpaid\", but *not* \"Account Payable\" is sometimes paid in the future, but the only ones with \"Unpaid\" &1; \"Account Payable\" seem correct.\n\n**Interest Receivables with Unpaid**:  \nThese are \"Interest Receivables\", not interest payables. So, not a liability.\n\nSo, the only liabilities at the end of the period are the Accounts Payable from unpaid purchases.\n\n## 4. Final Calculation\n\n- Initial Total Liabilities: 0.00\n- End Total Liabilities: 825,000.00\n\n## 5. Final Answer in required format\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', 'Total Liabilities End Value': '825000.00'} }\n```",
