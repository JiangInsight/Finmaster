We should look for explicit \"Fixed Assets\" entries or similar.\n\n#### Scanning the data:\n- There is one entry:\n  - | Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0 | ... |\n- All other transactions marked as \"Purchase\" are for inventory (i.e., products for resale, current asset — these are **operating activities**, **NOT investing**).\n\n#### Is there any disposal (sale) of fixed assets?\n- No entries for sale/disposal of long-term/fixed assets are present.\n\n### 3. **Determine the Outflows**\n- The only investing cash outflow is the **purchase of fixed assets: 5,000,000.00**.\n\n### 4. **Other possible purchase of long-term assets?**\n- None. All \"Purchase\" entries are purchases of inventory.\n\n### 5. **Any interest, etc., included?**\n- No. Interest is **operating or financing**, not investing, unless it's interest received on long-term investments; here, all \"Interest Receivable\" is likely from operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculation:**\n\n- **Outflow**: Purchase of fixed assets = **5,000,000.00**\n- **Inflow**: None\n\n**Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities** = **-5,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer (as per instructions):**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-5000000.00\"}}\n```",
