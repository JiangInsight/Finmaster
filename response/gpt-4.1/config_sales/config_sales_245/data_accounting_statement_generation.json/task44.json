What is required?\nWe need to find the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" amount that should be shown as an investing cash outflow in the cash flow statement.\n\n## 2. Key Principle\nIn the cash flow statement, the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" refers to actual cash outflows for acquiring fixed/non-current assets (such as property, plant, and equipment). This is different from normal inventory or stock purchases.\n\n## 3. Identifying Relevant Transactions\nWe need to search for purchase transactions that specifically relate to fixed assets. From the table, asset purchases can usually be identified by the \"type\" field containing \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar, or by the description indicating the item is a fixed asset (not for resale/inventory).\n\n**In this dataset**:\n- Most \"Purchase\" rows are titled for inventory (Product A, B, C, D).\n- Only in the sample, the fixed asset purchase was titled \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" and indicated asset_name and asset_type.\n\n**In THIS data set:**\n- There is an \"Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | ... | 5000000.0\"\n- This is part of the initial opening balances, not a cash purchase in the current period.\n- There is NO transaction with \"type\" containing \"Fixed Assets Purchase\".\n- Reviewing the entire list, **all purchases are of inventory items/stock**, not non-current fixed assets.\n\n## 4. Conclusion\n- There is **no cash outflow for the purchase of fixed assets in the period**. All purchases are of inventory (intended for resale), not fixed assets for company use.\n- Initial balances are not shown in cash flow from operating/investing activities, because they are opening balances, not current-period flows.\n\n## 5. Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"0\"} }\n```\n\n---\n**Reasoning:**  \nAll purchases recorded in the period are inventory purchases. There is no fixed (non-current) asset purchase (such as machinery, land, building) in the transactions. Opening balance for fixed assets is not a cash flow of the period.  \n\n**Therefore, Purchase of Fixed Assets for this period is 0.**",
