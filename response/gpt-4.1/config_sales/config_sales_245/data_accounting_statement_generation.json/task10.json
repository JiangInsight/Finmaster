Find Initial Non-current Assets\n\nNon-current assets are typically property, plant and equipment (PPE), fixed assets, intangible assets, long-term investments, etc.\n\nBy looking at the initial balances:\n\n- | id | type | date | recorded_date | amount | recorded_amount | ... \n- | Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | ... | 3000000.0 |\n- | Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | ... | 5000000.0 |\n- | Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | ... | 5000000.0 |\n\n**The only \"non-current asset\" here is:**\n- Fixed Assets = 5,000,000\n\n> {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\"}\n\n---\n\n## 2. Adjust for New Transactions During the Period\n\nWe only pick transactions that affect \"Non-current assets (Property, Plant and Equipment)\", typically by keywords in type or items like \"Fixed Assets\", \"Depreciation\" (which REDUCES assets) and so on.\n\n### 2.1 Additions\n\nLooking through all lines, the only possible additions are \"Fixed Assets\" purchases, typically in the type or asset_name. Let's check if there are such lines:\n\nLook for:\n- Type \"Fixed Assets\", \"Fixed Asset Purchase\", or similar\n- Asset_name column (not shown in this data, but in the example)\n\n**There is NO entry for new fixed assets purchases.**\nAll purchases with \"Purchase\" type refer to inventory or goods for resale (based on suppliers, product IDs, etc).\n\n**Thus, likely no new additions to fixed assets.** (If there had been entries like \"Fixed Asset Purchase\" or \"Storage Facilities\", we would add that amount.)\n\n### 2.2 Depreciation\n\nFind all lines where type is \"Depreciation\":\n\n> | Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | ... | 45757.71 |\n\nDepreciation reduces the value of fixed assets/non-current assets.\n\n**Total depreciation:**\n- 45,757.71\n\nThere is only one Depreciation line.\n\n---\n\n### 2.3 Check for Disposals/Sales\n\nNo entries for \"Asset disposal\", \"Sale of Fixed Asset\", etc.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Calculate Final Value\n\nFormula:\n**Ending Balance = Initial Value + Additions - Depreciation - Disposals**\n\nIn numbers:\n- Initial value: 5,000,000.00\n- Additions: 0\n- Depreciation: 45,757.71\n- Disposals: 0\n\nEnding Value = 5,000,000.00 - 45,757.71 = 4,954,242.29\n\n---\n\n## 4. Final JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"4954242.29\"} }\n```\n",
