Since the invoice text specifies \"Administrative Expenses\" for $21993.97 and \"Sales Expenses\" for $16483.36, and the amounts and categories are swapped in the table, one must be mis-categorized. The more likely correct mapping (since invoice is more reliable) is:\n   - $16483.36 should be \"Sales Expenses\"\n   - $21993.97 should be \"Administrative Expenses\"\n   - The table has mistakenly swapped the categories.\n\n2. **Sale20240102002**: This entry records quantity=1.0, unit price=39170.93, amount=39170.93, cost amount=20000.0, status=Unpaid, and method=Account Receviable. The *next* entry with id Sale20240102003 has quantity=2.0, unit price=35078.23, amount=70156.46, cost amount=40000.0, status=Paid, method=Cash, etc. However, the invoice text for each confirms that 1 unit at 39170.93 (unpaid) and 2 units at 35078.23 (paid), but the table columns 'recorded_cost_per_unit' and 'recorded_payment_method' have the values \"20000.0\" and \"Cash\" for the first (when invoice says unpaid and account receviable), and \"20000.0\" and \"Cash\" for the second, instead of matching the invoice. Therefore, at least in one record, cost unit/payment method/quantity/unit price + status are misaligned; including that, their profits (3rd record) also don't align with \"Original profit\" (from the calculation in invoice) and \"Recorded profit\" in table. \n\n3. **Sale20240102003**: The risk issues already indicate a profit inconsistency: 'Original profit: 30156.46', 'Recorded profit: 35038.31'. So there is a miscalculation of profit—check: amount 70156.46, cost 40000.00; 70156.46 - 40000.00 = 30156.46; but table records 'Recorded profit': 35038.31, which is incorrect (matches difference between after-tax amount and cost, not sale minus cost, per company policy). So, profit is miscalculated.\n\n4. **Rest**: Other records do not show internal inconsistencies (amount = quantity × unit price; methods, statuses, categories, and key numbers align with the invoice text in each). \n\nIf you want ALL inconsistencies in these rows, let me know, but above are the most clear mismatches found. Let me know if you want the complete scan for minor mismatches as well.",
