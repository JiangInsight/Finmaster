The cost amount for this transaction was $10000.00, with a tax amount of $909.91, leading to a total amount due of $17288.35. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- But the following fields are inconsistent:\n    - `recorded_type`: \"Purchase\" (should be \"Sale\")\n    - `recorded_tax_amount`: 17997.44 (should be 909.91 as per invoice: $18198.26 - $10000.00 = $8198.26 profit, so tax should not be $17997.44; invoice confirms $909.91 is correct).\n- The rest of the values (quantity, amount, unit price) match the invoice.\n- All other records do not show such clear mismatches based on the invoice text.\n",
