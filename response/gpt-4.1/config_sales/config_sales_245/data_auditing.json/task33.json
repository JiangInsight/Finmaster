The cost amount for this transaction was $40000.00, with a tax amount of $3446.24, leading to a total amount due of $65478.64. The receive_method ... was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n  - However, the recorded fields are:\n    - recorded_type: \"Administrative Expenses\" (should be \"Sale\")\n    - recorded_date: \"2024-02-06\" (should be \"2024-01-14\")\n    - recorded_price: 29642.47 (should be 34462.44)\n    - recorded_amount: 75539.57 (should be 68924.88)\n    - recorded_tax: 57746.91 (should be 3446.24)\n  - All other fields (quantity, payment_method, payment/receipt_status, etc.) match or aren't present.\n  - Therefore, the answer is a dictionary capturing all the differences, formatted as above.\n```",
