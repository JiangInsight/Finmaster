The cost amount for this transaction was $150000.00, with a tax amount of $13343.41, leading to a total amount due of $253524.71. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- **Recorded fields:** \n  - quantity: 2.0\n  - amount: 177912.08 (matches 2 × 88956.04)\n  - profit: 130298.54\n  - payment/receipt_status: 'Unpaid'\n- **Invoice claims:** \n  - quantity: 3.0\n  - unit price: 88956.04\n  - total amount: 266868.12 (3 × 88956.04)\n  - payment was received (\"paid\")\n  - after-tax amount: 253524.71 \n  - cost: 150000.00\n  - profit should be (266868.12 - 150000.00) = 116868.12\n\nThe recorded quantity, amount, payment/receipt_status, and profit do **not** match the invoice, which is generally considered authoritative. \n\nThe inconsistencies are:\n- quantity: recorded as 2.0, but invoice says 3.0\n- amount: recorded as 177912.08, invoice says 266868.12\n- payment/receipt_status: recorded as 'Unpaid', invoice says 'Paid'\n- profit: recorded as 130298.54, but invoice logic (266868.12 - 150000 = 116868.12)\n\nThese match the ones outlined in the risk_issues cell in your input.\n\n#### Fields not relevant:\n- The other fields (Preparer, Approver, payment_method, receive_method) match or are not detailed in invoice, so we leave them blank.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Only this transaction (id Sale20240119071) reveals internal inconsistencies between the recorded fields and the 'invoice' field in your input dataset. All other records appear internally consistent based on your sample. If you need a full scan for the remainder just ask!",
