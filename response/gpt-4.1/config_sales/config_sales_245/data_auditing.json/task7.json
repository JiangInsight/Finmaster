However, the sum is inconsistent: it's likely each of the \"Bank deposit\" and \"Fixed Assets\" rows are both paired with the \"Cash deposit\" inappropriately OR the amounts are overstated/duplicated.\n    - More specifically, based on the invoice field, they all say \"An invoice was issued for...\" for each deposit type at each value, but only one of these should be the originating equity injection; it looks like assets (cash, bank, fixed asset) got double-counted, when the total equity injection was only 8,000,000. Ideal correction would be: either \"Cash deposit\" 3,000,000 and \"Bank deposit\" 5,000,000 for a total of 8,000,000, or relate the fixed asset properly to the bank withdrawal used to buy it, not to the original capital injection.\n\n2. **Sale20240122082**\n    - The invoice states: \"The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n    - The recorded_receive_method field is \"Interest receivable\", which does not match, and is a clear internal inconsistency.\n    - So, Original: \"Cash\", Recorded: \"Interest receivable\".\n\nNo other clear field-level inconsistencies are visible from the 'invoice' descriptions and their respective row fields. All other Sale, Purchase, and interest rows match up with their totals, quantities, methods, statuses, and the invoice text.\n\n**If more are required:** You may repeat this format for additional found errors.
