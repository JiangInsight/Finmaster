There are two entries for this id, one as `\"Administrative Expenses\"` on `\"2024-02-14\"` for `\"32980.69\"`, one as `\"Sales Expenses\"` on `\"2024-01-29\"` for `\"17247.75\"` and one as `\"Administrative Expenses\"` on `\"2024-01-29\"` for `\"5786.51\"`.  \n3. The invoice field for the record with `\"2024-02-14\"` says \"On January 29, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Administrative Expenses, totaling $32980.69.\"  \n4. The date in the invoice (and in all same-id entries) confirms the correct date should be `\"2024-01-29\"`, making the current `\"2024-02-14\"` wrong.  \n5. The `\"Administrative Expenses\"` of `\"32980.69\"` is the only record for that exact amount, but the date has been mis-recorded.  \n6. The other \"Administrative Expenses\" with this id on the correct date is only for `\"5786.51\"`, which does not match the invoice, and the invoice refers to the larger amount.  \n7. Based on the invoice and id grouping, the more reliable/correct info should be:  \n   - Date: `\"2024-01-29\"`  \n   - Category: `\"Administrative Expenses\"`  \n   - Amount: `\"32980.69\"`  \n8. Therefore, the entry currently dated `\"2024-02-14\"` for `\"32980.69\"` has an incorrect date, and possibly an incorrect amount as there is no invoice for Administrative Expenses for that amount on that date.\n9. So, mapping the correction:\n   - Original category: Should be `\"Administrative Expenses\"` (from invoice), but could also be an erroneous copy of `\"Sales Expenses\"` (if matched by amount, but not by description)\n   - Original date: `\"2024-01-29\"`\n   - Recorded date: `\"2024-02-14\"`\n   - Original amount: `\"32980.69\"`\n   - Recorded amount: `\"32980.69\"` (amount likely correct, but for a different date) \n   - id: `\"Expense20240129001\"`  \n10. The rest (status, method, preparer, approver) are consistent across the group; quantity, price, tax, profit, etc., are absent for expense entries.\n\nIf you want ONLY the date inconsistency, you could also focus solely on that element (as in the provided example in your question).
