Entries with ID \"Initial20231231001\"\n- The same transaction ID is being used for three different types (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) *and* with different amounts ($3,000,000, $5,000,000, $5,000,000).\n- The invoice, however, only lists one entry for each, making it ambiguous which is correct.\n- Best estimate: This likely should be three different IDs, each dedicated to a single type and amount.\n\n#### 2. Sale20240119071\n- **recorded_payment/receipt_status** = \"Unpaid\", but the invoice risk issues/summary says \"cash\" and the language of the invoice implies the transaction \"was paid\".\n- **Correct value**: Should be \"Paid\" as per the invoice.\n\n##### Other entries appear consistent with the invoice descriptions, or lack sufficient invoice/risk info to definitively determine a difference.\n\n---\n\n**If you want the answer only for the entries with actual discrepancies, just entries 1-3 (initial deposit ID splitting issue) and Sale20240119071 (paid/unpaid) need reporting.**",
