But here, the same id is used for three entries, and the numbers do not align consistently.\n- Moreover, both \"Bank deposit\" and \"Fixed Assets\" record $5,000,000 under same id and invoice for the same dateâ€”this is very likely a copy error.\n- Based on the pattern from other entries in this simulated (or actual) accounting system, initial capital should be the sum of \"Cash deposit\" and \"Bank deposit\" (likely split between account and physical) and if relevant, the \"Fixed Assets\" portion should deduct from those cash/bank sources (i.e., should *not* be entered separately on the same id/invoice for the full amount).\n- The most likely correct value, from an invoice/reconciliation perspective, for initial capital is $8,000,000 (sum of $3M cash + $5M bank, possibly with part of this used to buy fixed assets, not stated as an extra injection).\n- The field inconsistencies are:\n    - Multiple \"categories\"/types for same id\n    - Duplicated or inconsistent amounts under same id\n    - On the same id, amounts do not sum to correct injected capital\n    - Asset split/recording does not match standard practice\n- The \"original\" (most likely correct) category should be \"Initial Investment/Equity Injection\", not three separate types.\n- The \"original\" amount should be $8,000,000.\n- The recorded category is \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\" (all under same id, which is inconsistent).\n- All other fields are either blank or unchanged.\n- Thus, the primary inconsistencies are in the category/type and the total amount.\n\n**Note:** If you need separate outputs per entry per id, this can be split, but here, the main inconsistency is for the id as a whole.",
