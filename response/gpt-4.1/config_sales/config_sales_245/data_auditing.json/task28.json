(Administrative/Sales/Financial Expenses) are swapped between the pairs across the rows, as seen in the reliable invoice description (\"On January XX, 2024, an invoice was issued for a XXX Expenses, totaling $YYY\"). The recorded fields have the categories flipped with respect to the amounts. The best estimate for the correct value is to align the amount with the expense category given in the invoice narrative.\n- The process is repeated for all records matching this category swap pattern, focusing on those where the invoice suggests a different mapping than the table.\n- Only records with such inconsistencies are reported in this solution output per instruction. All other fields for these rows appear consistent with their invoice description.",
