The payment_method of this transaction was bank transfer, and this transaction was paid.\"\n  - The record says: 6.0 units, amount 60000.0, receipt status Unpaid, payment method Bank Transfer.\n\n- From the invoice (\"generally considered more reliable\") vs the recorded values:\n  - **quantity**: Invoice says 7.0, record says 6.0 → Invoice likely correct.\n  - **amount**: Invoice says $70000.0, record $60000.0 → Invoice likely correct ($10000 × 7 = $70000).\n  - **payment/receipt_status**: Invoice says Paid, record Unpaid → Invoice likely correct.\n- No mention of payment method discrepancy (both say Bank Transfer).\n\nTherefore:\n- The main fields with inconsistencies: quantity, amount, payment/receipt_status.\n- Best estimate of correct values (answer structure above) filled accordingly. Other fields (category, dates, etc.) show as null since not in error.\n",
