The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $1958.55, leading to a total amount due of $37212.38. The receive_method was account receivable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"**\n- However, the table's fields are as follows:\n  - recorded_type: **Sales Expenses** (should be **Sale**)\n  - recorded_amount: **44748.19** (should be **39170.93**)\n  - recorded_unit_price: **42393.68** (should be **39170.93**)\n  - recorded_tax_amount: **30206.88** (should be **1958.55**)\n\nSo, 'Original' comes from the invoice string, and 'Recorded' is the mis-entry in the data. All the other fields (Preparer, Approver, Profit) are either correct or not shown/matching in both, so left as is.",
