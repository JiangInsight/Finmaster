The `recorded_unit_price` says 18431.87, which doesn't match (18431.87 * 9 = 165886.83).\n- All other fields in that row are consistent with the invoice and the correct value (e.g., total amount, payment method, etc.).\n- Only this line contains actual inconsistencies in the data provided in the \"problem.\" No other rows in this set have internal inconsistencies (i.e., mismatching values between invoice and recorded fields).\n",
