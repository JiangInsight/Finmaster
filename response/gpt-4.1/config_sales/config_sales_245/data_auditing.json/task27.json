So, 'Recorded category' is wrongly set as \"Sales Expenses\" instead of \"Sale\".\n- **Amount:** The invoice states the sale is $9561.13, but the recorded_amount is $11439.62 (matches recorded_unit_price). So, recorded_amount should be $9561.13 per invoice.\n- **Unit Price:** The invoice total is $9561.13 and for 1 unit, so unit price should be $9561.13, but recorded_unit_price is $10618.35 (from another referenced line). So, recorded_unit_price should be $9561.13.\n- **Other fields:** Preparer, approver, date, payment/receipt_status, payment_method, quantity, receive_method, tax, profit all seem coherent or not contradicted by the invoice, so they are either equal or not applicable.\n\n**Note:** There is only one such error in the provided \"problem\" dataset; other rows are consistent or not a direct contradiction. If you need more, clarify which rows to check.",
