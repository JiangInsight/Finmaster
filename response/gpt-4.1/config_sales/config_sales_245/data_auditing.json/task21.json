The cost amount for this transaction was $60000.00, with a tax amount of $5259.95, leading to a total amount due of $99939.04. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n- In the table's columns, however, for id Sale20240122083:\n  - recorded_type is \"Depreciation\" (should be \"Sale\")\n  - recorded_amount is 124650.19 (should be 3 × 35066.33 = 105198.99, as per both unit price × quantity and invoice)\n- All other fields (quantity, unit price, receiving method, status, etc) match or are not provided in both sources.  \n- Therefore, primary inconsistencies: recorded_type and recorded_amount do not match the invoice (which is considered the most reliable source).\n- So we fill in the json fields accordingly (all other fields left null/\"______\" as there is no evidence for issues).",
