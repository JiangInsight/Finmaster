The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $1897.41, leading to a total amount due of $36050.81. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- In the table, for id \"Sale20240103005\":\n  - recorded_quantity: 1.0 (should be 2.0)\n  - recorded_unit_price: 20692.61 (should be 18974.11)\n  - recorded_amount: 18974.11 (should be 37948.22)\n  - recorded_tax_amount: 38290.83 (should be 1897.41)\n  - recorded_receive_method: '' (should be 'Cash')\n  - (One amount field may be secondary, but the profit is not stated, so it is left blank)\n\nAll other entries in the table conform to the invoice data and have no detectable internal inconsistency by this pattern.\n\n**Conclusion:** Only Sale20240103005 shows internal inconsistencies requiring correction as shown above; the rest of the transactions are consistent or have no mapping mismatches detectable from invoice and row data. If more errors are found, they would be included similarly, but for this selection only this one appears.",
