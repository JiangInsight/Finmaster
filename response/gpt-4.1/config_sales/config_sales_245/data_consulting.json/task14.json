Double-checking my approach against the pattern of the example (given Beginning AR = 0), the calculation appears to use Ending AR / 2 as average—confirming above logic.\n\nSo:\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio  \n= Total Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \n= 5,991,764.34 / 566,707.07  \n≈ 10.58\n\nHowever, the example gives a number that is about HALF that, suggesting an error. Let's check:\n\nIn the example:  \nTotal Revenue = 5,431,018.59  \nEnd AR = 2,429,482.13  \nAvg AR = (0 + 2,429,482.13)/2 = 1,214,741.07  \nTurnover = 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.07 = 4.47 (matches provided example!)\n\nSo our calculation is correct with this approach.\n\n**Final answer:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 5,991,764.34 / 566,707.07 = **10.58** (rounded to two decimal places)  \n(Previous draft said 6.22 -- this was an arithmetic slip.)\n\nSo the correct answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"10.58\"} }\n```",
