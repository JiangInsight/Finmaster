So the correct answer is **12.16**.\n\n   After reviewing the methodology and matching it with the example, my initial calculation should be presented as:\n\n   - Current Ratio: 6.51\n   - Inventory Turnover Ratio: 12.16\n\nSo, final answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Current Ratio\": \"6.51\", \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"12.16\"}}\n```",
