                        "content": "```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.21\",\n  \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-0.04\",\n  \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.04\",\n  \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.36\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\"\n} }\n```\n\n**Step-by-step Calculations:**\n\n1. **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio** = Total Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable\n   - Total Revenue = 5,064,939.23\n   - Accounts Receivable (beginning) = 0, (ending) = 1,851,327.29\n   - Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 1,851,327.29) / 2 = 925,663.65\n   - Ratio = 5,064,939.23 / 925,663.65 ≈ 5.47\n\n**However**, if you compare with the example which uses only ending AR for first period (since AR at start is 0), the typical approach is:\n   - Ratio = 5,064,939.23 / 1,851,327.29 ≈ 2.74\n\n**BUT the previous sample uses average (0+2,429,482.13)/2=1,214,741.07, and then 5,431,018.59/1,214,741.07=4.47**. So use average method for consistency.\n   - So: 5,064,939.23 / 925,663.65 ≈ 5.47\n\nBut let's check the example's numbers:\n- For example: Revenues=5,431,018.59; Avg AR=(0+2,429,482.13)/2=1,214,741.07; 5,431,018.59/1,214,741.07=4.47.\n\nSo yes: Average is [(start+end)/2]. Thus,\n- 5,064,939.23 / 925,663.65 ≈ 5.47\n\n**However, in the sample, \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": '4.47'**; but in the newest case:\n- Average AR = 925,663.65\n- Turnover = 5,064,939.23/925,663.65 ≈ 5.47\n\n2. **Operating cash flow ratio** = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Ending Current Liabilities\n    - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -64,099.10\n    - Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n    - Ratio = -64,099.10 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ -0.043\n\n3. **Operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio**: Same as above (as per example).\n    - Answer: -0.04\n\n4. **Total Asset Turnover Ratio** = Total Revenue / Average Total Assets\n    - Avg Total Assets = (13,000,000 + 15,200,446.16)/2 = 14,100,223.08\n    - Ratio = 5,064,939.23 / 14,100,223.08 ≈ 0.36\n\n5. **Debt to Equity Ratio** = Ending Total Liabilities / Ending Owner’s Equity\n    - Ending Total Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n    - Ending Owner’s Equity = 13,707,199.17\n    - Ratio = 1,493,246.99 / 13,707,199.17 ≈ 0.109\n\n**Final Values (rounded two decimal):**\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: 5.47\n- Op cash flow ratio: -0.04\n- Op cash flow to current liabilities ratio: -0.04\n- Total Asset Turnover Ratio: 0.36\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.11\n\n**But** looking at the example, it uses two decimal places for turnover and the ratios—let's match that.\n\nSo, the final answer should be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '5.47', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-0.04', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.04', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.36', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11'} }\n```\n",
