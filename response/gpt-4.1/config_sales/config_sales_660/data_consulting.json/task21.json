Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n- FCF is typically calculated as:\n  - FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities – Capital Expenditures (Purchases of Fixed Assets)\n- From the cash flow statement:\n  - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -64099.10\n  - Purchase of Fixed Assets = 528936.17\n  - FCF = -64099.10 – 528936.17 = **-593035.27**\n\nAlternatively, in the provided format, FCF is taken as the net change in cash and cash equivalents, which is **-593035.27**, matching the calculation above.\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n- Formula: Current Assets Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Average Current Assets\n- Revenue (from Income Statement): 5,064,939.23\n- Average Current Assets = (Beginning + Ending) / 2 = (8,000,000.00 + 9,717,259.46) / 2 = 8,858,629.73\n- Current Assets Turnover Ratio = 5,064,939.23 / 8,858,629.73 ≈ **0.57**\n\nHowever, the previous example used two decimal places (0.68 for similar numbers), so rounding:\n- 5,064,939.23 ÷ 8,858,629.73 = 0.572\n\nRounded to two decimal places: **0.57**\n\nBut in the sample answer above, to fully match the calculation (using the \"Total Revenue\" / Average Current Assets rounded to two decimal places):\n- **\"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.57\"**\n\nTherefore, updating:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-593035.27\",\n  \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.57\"\n}}\n```",
