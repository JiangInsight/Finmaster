So, there is no correction needed, but I've included it in the output for completeness with values matching.\n\n- No further inconsistencies are present in the provided sample for the remaining rows. All other fields, where the amount is calculated as quantity × price, match, and the amounts and other values are all supported by the invoice field. \n\n- The third solution block is left blank as a placeholder — it can be omitted or filled only if any additional issues are found, but in the given data, there aren’t others. \n\nFeel free to ask about any specific row or want a deeper explanation for another transaction.",
