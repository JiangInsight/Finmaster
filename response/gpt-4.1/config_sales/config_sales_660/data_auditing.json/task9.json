The cost amount for this transaction was $10000.00, with a tax amount of $932.32, leading to a total amount due of $17713.98. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n  - **Recorded tax** is 18035.45, while all calculated fields and the invoice text support it should be **932.32** (as 18646.30 * 0.05 = 932.32 assuming 5% VAT).\n  - All other fields match; only the tax value is inconsistent.\n- Thus, the field inconsistency is in the `recorded_tax_amount`: recorded 18035.45, should be 932.32. All other fields are consistent with the invoice.\n- The template is filled accordingly above, as per your output request. \n\n## There are no other inconsistencies in the provided data extract.
