The cost amount for this transaction was $150,000.00, with a tax amount of $13,569.10, leading to a total amount due of $257,812.85. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- The recorded fields:\n  - quantity: 2.0\n  - unit price: 90460.65\n  - amount: 180921.3 (= 2 Ã— 90460.65)\n  - cost amount: 150000\n- However, the invoice (which is considered more reliable) says 3.0 units, total amount of 271381.95, everything else matches.\n- Therefore:\n  - The recorded quantity should be 3.0, not 2.0\n  - The recorded amount should be 271381.95, not 180921.3\n  - The recorded profit should be 121381.95, but properly recalculated based on corrected amount and cost if needed.\n\nAll other fields are consistent.\n",
