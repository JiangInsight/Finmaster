For each transaction row, check if any of the standardized (hard to err) fields in the `invoice` summary disagree with the recorded values in the structured fields.\n2. For most rows, the structured fields and the invoice agree.\n3. For two rows (`Expense20240124001` and `Expense20240115001`), the `recorded_approver` is blank/None, but the `invoice` clearly states: \"This transaction was prepared by X, and the approver is Director.\" This is an inconsistency because the standardized invoice indicates Director as Approver, but this is missing in the recorded field.\n4. In both cases, the correction would be to record 'Director' in the approver field.\n5. No other discrepancies are found in other transactions for the sample provided.\n\n**Formatting explanation:**\n\n- Only fields with inconsistencies are filled in, per instruction and example (minimal fields are filled in the JSON output).\n- All other fields are omitted or left blank, matching example behavior.",
