The transaction with `id = Expense20240124001` is for Sales Expenses, Jan 24, 2024, amount 27788.26.\n2. The `recorded_payment_method` is 'Bank Transfer'.\n3. However, the invoice text says: \"The payment_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\" \n4. Multiple expense entries with the same id and similar structure on this day (as is common for expense batching) show 'Cash' as the payment method, matching their description.\n5. Therefore, it is clear the reliable invoice narrative is correct and the value should be 'Cash'.\n6. All other fields are consistent or have no direct conflict.\n\n**Thus, only the payment method is at issue; all other fields are consistent/absent.**",
