The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $1886.87, leading to a total amount due of $35850.48. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n   - The recorded category is \"Sales Expenses\" while the invoice says \"Sale\".\n   - The recorded date is \"2024-01-19\" whereas the original (invoice) date is \"2024-01-08\".\n   - The recorded price/unit is 31747.29; invoice price is 37737.35.\n   - The recorded amount is 46702.45; invoice says 37737.35.\n   - The recorded tax is 37511.58; invoice says 1886.87.\n\n2. **Correction Summary**\n   - Using the invoice as the most reliable reference, the original values are as outlined above.\n   - The corrected (original) values have been copied into the solution, replacing the inconsistent recorded ones.\n\n3. **No mismatch on payment/receipt_status, payment_method, receive_method, Preparer/Approver (those are present or same).**\n   - For any fields not explicitly stated in the invoice or that match, leave as is or null.\n\n4. **Output as requested in the format, as a list since only one true inconsistency was identified in this batch.**\n\nIf you wish to see more, please give more specific rows; this is the one with detectable inconsistency per your format.",
