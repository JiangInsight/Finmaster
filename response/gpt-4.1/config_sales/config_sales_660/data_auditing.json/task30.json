So it should be 70059.88 x 0.1 = 7005.99, but the invoice says tax is 3502.99, which aligns with prior rows, suggesting tax = 5%. Thus, 3502.99 is best estimate.\n    - Several sale fields like product info, cost, customer, etc., are present and match a sale, not an expense.\n    - The profit, approver, preparer etc. are left as null because the invoice and other fields do not provide values for them or there is no inconsistency/evidence to set them. \n\nTherefore, this entry is misclassified and the numeric fields are inconsistent with what the invoice describes.",
