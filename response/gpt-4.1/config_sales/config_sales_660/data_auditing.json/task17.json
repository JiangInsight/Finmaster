The cost amount for this transaction was $15000.00, with a tax amount of $1494.39, leading to a total amount due of $28393.47. The receive_method of this transaction was account receviable, and this transaction was unpaid.\"\n- But the row lists:\n  - `recorded_type`: **Purchase** (should be \"Sale\")\n  - `recorded_receive_method`: **Interest receivable** (should be \"Account Receviable\")\n- All other fields match the invoice.\n- Thus, the error is in the classification (`category`) and receive method fields.\n- We fill in all other fields (even if they are blank, for completeness).\n- The correct values are from the invoice, which is the gold standard in this use case.",
