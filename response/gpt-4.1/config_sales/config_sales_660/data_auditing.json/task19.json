The cost amount for this transaction was $10000.00, with a tax amount of $974.41, leading to a total amount due of $18513.77. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\n\n- The actual recorded fields are:\n  - `recorded_type`: **Sales Expenses** (should be **Sale**)\n  - `recorded_date`: **2024-01-23** (should be **2024-01-12**, per invoice and rest of batch on that id)\n  - All other fields (amount, quantity, price, payment/receipt status, etc.) match the invoice narration.\n\n- Therefore, the inconsistencies are:\n  - Category/type mismatch: should be \"Sale\", but recorded as \"Sales Expenses\".\n  - Date mismatch: should be 2024-01-12, but recorded as 2024-01-23.\n\n- All other fields (payment method, status, quantities, price, amounts) are consistent with the invoice.\n\n- Many other transactions are internally consistent or any differences are explainable by staff changes or are batch entries.\n\n**Final output above matches the required format.**",
