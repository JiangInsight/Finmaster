This is an inconsistency, and the correct date should be `2024-01-29`.\n   - For `Sale20240114047` the invoice says \"On January 14, 2024...\", but the recorded date is `2024-01-19`.\n\n3. **Check all other fields**:\n   - No other discrepancies are noticeable between invoice and recorded fields; all descriptions (amounts, payers, etc.) match.\n\n4. **Format the solution as specified**:\n   - For each detected inconsistency, provide the id, incorrect field, the value as recorded, and the correct value based on the invoice.\n\n5. **If there are no further inconsistencies, fill the rest with `None` as in your example.**\n\n**Therefore, the solution output above contains the two detected internal consistency errors in your sample.**",
