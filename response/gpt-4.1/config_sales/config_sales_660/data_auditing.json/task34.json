The cost amount for this transaction was \\$40000.00, with a tax amount of \\$3719.35, leading to a total amount due of \\$70667.67. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n\n- However, in the record:\n  - `recorded_type` is \"Financial Expenses\" instead of \"Sale\".\n  - `recorded_date` (\"2024-02-14\") does not match the invoice date (\"2024-01-27\").\n  - `recorded_quantity` is 1.0, not 2.0 as per the invoice.\n  - `recorded_unit_price` is 32274.37, not 37193.51.\n  - `recorded_tax_amount` is 83692.5, not 3719.35 (appears to be the total price Ã— 2 or a clear error).\n  - `recorded_amount` is 37193.51 (line record) vs invoice total (74387.02).\n- All other derived fields such as profit, after-tax-amount, etc., appear affected by the above incorrect values.\n\n- The most reliable source is the invoice. Fields should conform to the structured and regulated invoice, not to incorrect data capture.\n\n- This entry contains mismatched category/type, wrong quantity/price/tax, wrong date, etc., with reliable correct values available in the invoice text.\n```",
