The cost amount ... $20000.00, tax amount ... $1950.22, ... total ... $37054.20. ... was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n   - Quantity in words: 2.0 units\n   - Unit price: $19,502.21\n   - Total: $39,004.42\n   - Paid (not unpaid)\n   - Cash receive method\n\n2. **Compare to Recorded Fields**:\n   - `recorded_quantity`: 1.0 (Should be **2.0**)\n   - `recorded_payment/receipt_status`: Unpaid (Should be **Paid** according to invoice and payment via cash)\n   - `recorded_amount`: 19,502.21 (Should be **39,004.42**)\n   - `recorded_receive_method`: Cash (matches correct value)\n   - Other fields (tax, profit, preparer, approver): match or cannot be confirmed from this entry\n\n3. **Output Only Internal Inconsistencies**:\n   - The two major discrepancies: quantity (1 vs 2) and payment/receipt_status (Unpaid vs Paid). The amount is stored as 19,502.21, not matching the invoice total of 39,004.42, but this is a consequence of the quantity error. So the source error is the quantity.\n\n4. **Final Output Formatting**:\n   - As per format: Report both issues with the correct value inferred from the invoice.\n\nThus,\n- For id: Sale20240128107,\n  - 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid'\n  - 'Original quantity': '2.00', 'Recorded quantity': '1.00'\n\n_Note: Only one entry in your data set had an internal inconsistency based on the invoice as source of truth._",
