Bank deposit, Fixed Assets)  \n   - No internal inconsistency â€“ invoice amounts match amounts, all relevant fields align as per standard; no correction needed, but three entries share the same ID, which, depending on context, may be a system issue (but if expected, not an error per task instructions).\n\n2. **Purchase20231231001**  \n   - All details match, no discrepancies.\n\n3. **Purchase20231231020**  \n   - Invoice description (\"6.0 units at a unit price of $50000.00, totaling $300000.00\") is inconsistent with recorded_unit_price (\"54993.63\"). Recorded amount and invoice match, so invoice favors as correct; same for date (\"On December 31, 2023...\") but recorded_date is \"2024-01-08\". Thus:\n     - \"Original price\": 50000.0 (from invoice), \"Recorded price\": 54993.63 (recorded).\n     - \"Original date\": \"2023-12-31\" (invoice), \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-08\" (recorded).\n\nThe rest of the transactions in the sample all align with their invoice details and the recorded fields; other than repeated identical IDs for deposits and transfers (which do not contradict the instructions or describe contradictions within a single row), no row has a field-internal mismatch relative to the (assumed more reliable) 'invoice' narrative.\n\nIf there are other rows with discrepancies, please specify so I can add them to the output.",
