The question is asking for \"the specific line items and value of total assets that are not expected to be realised or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle\".\n2. This refers to non-current assets (i.e., assets that are not expected to be converted to cash, sold, or consumed within one operating cycle, such as fixed assets, long-term investments, intangibles, etc.).\n3. On the provided balance sheet, the non-current asset category is \"Total Non-current Assets\", which is the sum of Fixed Assets minus Accumulated Depreciation (but is already presented as a subtotal).\n4. Initial value for Total Non-current Assets (2023-12-31) is 5,000,000.00.\n5. End value for Total Non-current Assets (2024-01-29) is 5,483,186.70.\n\nThus, the required answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5483186.70'} }\n```",
