Only \"Fixed Assets\" balance is initialized.\n- So, **Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value = 0.00**.\n\n## Step 2: Find All Depreciation Expenses up to End Date\n- Look for \"Depreciation\" entries, or \"Depreciation Expense\" entries, during the period.\n- Among all entries, only one matches:  \n    | Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | ... | 45749.47 | 45749.47 | ... |\n- No other subsequent depreciation entries are found.\n- Therefore, the amount charged during this period is **45,749.47**.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Accumulated Depreciation End Value\n- Since the only (and first) depreciation entry is 45,749.47, and no initial accumulated depreciation existed,\n- **Accumulated Depreciation End Value = 45,749.47**\n\n## Step 4: Prepare Final Output\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"45749.47\"} }\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- Initial value is zero (no opening accumulated depreciation found).\n- End value is sum of all depreciation posted: 45,749.47.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"45749.47\"} }\n```",
