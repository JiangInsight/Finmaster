                        "content": "Let's walk through step by step:\n\n## 1. What is \"Accounts Receivable\" in Cash Flow Statement?\n- \"Accounts Receivable\" increases when sales are made on credit (not yet paid, i.e., \"Unpaid\" and \"Account Receviable\" in the data).\n- \"Accounts Receivable\" decreases when customers pay what they owed — this will show as cash received (so those sales with \"Paid\").\n\nFor the cash flow statement, we're interested in the **net change** in accounts receivable:  \n**(End balance of A/R) – (Start balance of A/R) = Net Increase (Decrease)**  \nThis amount needs to be shown as **a deduction from net profit** if it's an increase (i.e., more money tied up, cash outflow), or an addition if it's a decrease (customers are paying, freeing up cash).\n\n## 2. Start and End Periods\n- The opening balance date = 2023-12-31.\n- The transactions to include = 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-29.\n\n## 3. Find Opening (\"Initial\") Accounts Receivable\n**From provided data, there is NO separate opening \"account receivable\" listed for 2023-12-31**, so we assume starting A/R is **zero**.\n\n## 4. Identify ALL Sales on Credit (Unpaid/Account Receivable) Within the Period\n\nWe will sum up **ALL sales during Jan 2024 with \"Unpaid\" and receive_method \"Account Receviable\" (or similar)**.\n\nLet's go through the data from 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-29 and sum \"amount\" where:\n- type: Sale,\n- payment/receipt_status: Unpaid,\n- receive_method: Account Receviable (text variants: \"Account Receviable\", \"Account Receivable\", etc.).\n\n### List of All Sales on Credit:\n\nLet’s find & sum each sale (type = Sale, payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\", and obviously non-cash receive method):\n\n#### From the provided data, here are the credit sales:\n\n| id | date | amount |\n|---|---|---|\n| Sale20240103010 | 2024-01-03 | 38,997.09 |\n| Sale20240104012 | 2024-01-04 | 70,456.48 |\n| Sale20240106019 | 2024-01-06 | 55,318.92 |\n| Sale20240106020 | 2024-01-06 | 51,853.62 |\n| Sale20240107021 | 2024-01-07 | 54,295.02 |\n| Sale20240107023 | 2024-01-07 | 38,307.23 |\n| Sale20240109031 | 2024-01-09 | 9,336.67 |\n| Sale20240110034 | 2024-01-10 | 59,913.93 |\n| Sale20240110036 | 2024-01-10 | 105,182.97 |\n| Sale20240111037 | 2024-01-11 | 88,373.95 |\n| Sale20240112038 | 2024-01-12 | 178,436.76 |\n| Sale20240113044 | 2024-01-13 | 19,697.24 |\n| Sale20240113045 | 2024-01-13 | 36,195.87 |\n| Sale20240114094 | 2024-01-14 | 29,887.86 |\n| Sale20240115051 | 2024-01-15 | 25,833.39 |\n| Sale20240116057 | 2024-01-16 | 34,349.19 |\n| Sale20240120074 | 2024-01-20 | 17,898.02 |\n| Sale20240120075 | 2024-01-20 | 34,296.24 |\n| Sale20240121077 | 2024-01-21 | 36,421.21 |\n| Sale20240121079 | 2024-01-21 | 25,618.35 |\n| Sale20240122083 | 2024-01-22 | 199,540.68 |\n| Sale20240123088 | 2024-01-23 | 19,898.44 |\n| Sale20240123089 | 2024-01-23 | 76,210.5 |\n| Sale20240124093 | 2024-01-24 | 17,172.26 |\n| Sale20240125097 | 2024-01-25 | 268,595.22 |\n| Sale20240128108 | 2024-01-28 | 59,395.56 |\n| Sale20240128110 | 2024-01-28 | 199,844.62 |\n\nDouble-check: \n- Sale20240129054 is paid; \n- Sale20240129055 is paid; \n- Sale20240129113 is paid; \n- Sale20240129114 is paid; \n- Sale20240129115 is paid.\n- Sale20240129115 up to Sale20240129115: all \"Paid\".\n\nSo, up to 2024-01-29, the **last credit sales is Sale20240128110**.\n\n## 5. Total Credit Sales (Jan 2024):\n\nLet’s sum the above:\n\nSum:\n38,997.09  \n+ 70,456.48  \n+ 55,318.92  \n+ 51,853.62  \n+ 54,295.02  \n+ 38,307.23  \n+ 9,336.67  \n+ 59,913.93  \n+ 105,182.97  \n+ 88,373.95  \n+ 178,436.76  \n+ 19,697.24  \n+ 36,195.87  \n+ 29,887.86  \n+ 25,833.39  \n+ 34,349.19  \n+ 17,898.02  \n+ 34,296.24  \n+ 36,421.21  \n+ 25,618.35  \n+ 199,540.68  \n+ 19,898.44  \n+ 76,210.5  \n+ 17,172.26  \n+ 268,595.22  \n+ 59,395.56  \n+ 199,844.62  \n\nLet's sum these stepwise for accuracy.\n\n### Partial sums:\n\n1. 38,997.09  \n2. +70,456.48 = 109,453.57  \n3. +55,318.92 = 164,772.49  \n4. +51,853.62 = 216,626.11  \n5. +54,295.02 = 270,921.13  \n6. +38,307.23 = 309,228.36  \n7. +9,336.67 = 318,565.03  \n8. +59,913.93 = 378,478.96  \n9. +105,182.97 = 483,661.93  \n10. +88,373.95 = 572,035.88  \n11. +178,436.76 = 750,472.64  \n12. +19,697.24 = 770,169.88  \n13. +36,195.87 = 806,365.75  \n14. +29,887.86 = 836,253.61  \n15. +25,833.39 = 862,087.00  \n16. +34,349.19 = 896,436.19  \n17. +17,898.02 = 914,334.21  \n18. +34,296.24 = 948,630.45  \n19. +36,421.21 = 985,051.66  \n20. +25,618.35 = 1,010,670.01  \n21. +199,540.68 = 1,210,210.69  \n22. +19,898.44 = 1,230,109.13  \n23. +76,210.5 = 1,306,319.63  \n24. +17,172.26 = 1,323,491.89  \n25. +268,595.22 = 1,592,087.11  \n26. +59,395.56 = 1,651,482.67  \n27. +199,844.62 = 1,851,327.29  \n\n**Total Credit Sales = 1,851,327.29**\n\n## 6. Sum Up ALL Receipts of Prior Credit Sales (A/R Collections)\n\nBut did customers PAY off any of the credit sales during Jan 2024?\n- The \"Sale\" lines show \"Paid\", but in this data, payments always seem to match sales (i.e., paid at time of sale). There are no explicit payments received from prior period's A/R (because the opening A/R is 0).\n- Thus, all PAID sale lines are for deals done & paid on that date, NOT collections on old A/R.\n\nSo for the first period, **all \"Paid\" are not receipts on A/R, but current period sales**.  \nThus, the **accounts receivable increased by the sum of credit sales**.\n\n## 7. Net Change in A/R\n\nOpening A/R: 0  \nAdd: All credit sales: 1,851,327.29  \nCollections: 0 (no evidence of any cash collection on previous A/R since we started with 0)\n\n**Net Increase in Accounts Receivable:** 1,851,327.29\n\nFor the Cash Flow Statement:  \n**Increase in Accounts Receivable:** (1,851,327.29) (This is a CASH OUTFLOW; it reduces cash flow from operating activities)\n\n## 8. Format the Answer\n\nIn the requested json format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-1851327.29\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-1851327.29\"}}\n```",
