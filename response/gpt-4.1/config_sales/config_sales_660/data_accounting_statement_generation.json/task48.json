Bank Deposit (Initial): 5,000,000.00\nShould be included if bank deposits are cash equivalents; in example they are.\n\n#### If both cash and bank are counted as cash equivalents:\n\n- Initial Deposit (cash+bank): 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000\n\nBut the question is, net increase for THIS PERIOD. If initial is 8,000,000, total cash in/out as above, so we only count net cash inflow/outflow due to cash-based (since initial included in opening cash).\n\n### 11. Finally\n**Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents:** 5,452,719.05 - 3,356,648.21 = **2,096,070.84**\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Increase\": \"2096070.84\"} }\n```\nIf you wish to show a negative sign (if outflows > inflows), use the sign accordingly. Here, it is **positive**.\n\n---\n\n**If you have any required adjustments (for bank-only transactions, etc.) per your specific scenario, that can be re-checked.**",
