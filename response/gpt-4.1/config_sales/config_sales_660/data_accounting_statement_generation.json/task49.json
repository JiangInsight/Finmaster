Net Profit**\nSum all the profit from sales:\n- Each sale row with a 'profit' value given must be summed.\n- Total net profit from all sales = **927,702.20**\n\n### **2. Depreciation**\n- Only one row: 2024-01-01 = 45,749.47\n\n### **3. (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable**\n- Sum up all \"after_tax_amount\" on sales marked as \"Unpaid\" or with \"Account Receivable\" in receive_method (from the first to last entry). This is the increase in Receivable (since all are new).\n- Final AR balance = ending AR from all unpaid sales: **1,568,709.55** (negative since more AR at end than beginning). No AR at initial date.\n\n### **4. (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable**\n- Sum all \"Interest Receivables\" -- only those marked \"Unpaid\" each day:\n    - Jan 1:    445.0\n    - Jan 2:    443.22\n    - Jan 3:    398.72\n    - Jan 4:    392.14\n    - Jan 5:    384.13\n    - Jan 6:    344.08\n    - Jan 7:    323.48\n    - Jan 8:    323.48\n    - Jan 9:    323.48\n    - Jan 10:   323.48\n    - Jan 11:   323.48\n    - Jan 12:   323.48\n    - Jan 13:   323.48\n    - Jan 14:   323.48\n    - Jan 15:   312.16\n    - Jan 16:   295.13\n    - Jan 17:   259.53\n    - Jan 18:   259.53\n    - Jan 19:   259.53\n    - Jan 20:   259.53\n    - Jan 21:   259.53\n    - Jan 22:   259.53\n    - Jan 23:   259.53\n    - Jan 24:   259.53\n    - Jan 25:   259.53\n    - Jan 26:   259.53\n    - Jan 27:   259.53\n    - Jan 28:   255.08\n    - Jan 29:   255.08\n\n    **Total = 7,621.69** (No interest receivable at beginning, so increase = negative outflow)\n\n### **5. (Increase) Decrease in Inventory**\n- Total Purchases (amount, both paid and unpaid on all \"Purchase\" entries): Compute total purchases from all \"Purchase\" (exclude fixed assets) = 2,050,000.00\n  (No opening inventory is given, it's considered an increase, so negative outflow.)\n\n### **6. Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**\n- All unpaid purchases go to new payables:\n    - Jan 1:   140,000\n    - Jan 2:   40,000\n    - Jan 2:   50,000\n    - Jan 7:   100,000\n    - Jan 12:  60,000\n    - Jan 14:  60,000\n    - Jan 17:  70,000\n    - Jan 20:  30,000\n    - Jan 22:  160,000\n    - Jan 23:  45,000\n    - Jan 24:  15,000\n    - Jan 28:  15,000\n\n    **Total = 670,000.00** (All new AP, so positive adjustment.)\n\n### **7. Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable**\nSum all 'tax_amount' on sales (since all sales increase tax payable):\n- Add up all 'tax_amount' from each sale, assuming beginning balance is 0.\n- Total tax_amount from all sales = **163,491.55**\n  (All new tax liability, so positive)\n\n### **8. Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**\nPlug into cash flow indirect method:\nNet Cash Flow = Net Profit + Depreciation\n  - (Increase) Decrease in AR\n  - (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\n  - (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\n  + Increase in AP\n  + Increase in Tax Payable\n\n= 927,702.20 + 45,749.47 - 1,568,709.55 - 7,621.69 - 2,050,000.00 + 670,000.00 + 163,491.55  \n= **-2,563,888.02**\n\n### **9. Cash Flow from Investing Activities / Purchase of Fixed Assets**\n- All Fixed Asset purchases (\"Fixed Assets Purchase\" rows): total:\n    - 73,907.19 (production line 4)\n    - 171,448.09 (storage 5)\n    - 92,277.65 (production 6)\n    - 191,303.24 (production 7)\n    = 528,936.16\n\n### **10. Cash and Cash Equivalents**\n- Beginning: Only cash and bank from initial = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = **8,000,000**\n\n### **11. Ending Balance**\n- Calculate net cash flows:  \n  8,000,000 (beg.) - 2,563,888.02 (operating) - 528,936.16 (investing) = 4,907,175.82\n\n### **12. Net Increase**\n- Ending - Beginning = 4,907,175.82 - 8,000,000 = -3,092,824.18\n\n---\n\nAll above composed into JSON as required.\n\n**If you need explicit step-by-step numbers and cross-references, please let me know.**",
