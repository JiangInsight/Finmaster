We are to find the cash (actual) purchase of fixed assets for the cash flow statement, specifically the amount paid to acquire fixed assets during the period. \n2. In the table, only transactions with \"type\" = \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" represent purchases of fixed assets.\n3. Summing all such rows' \"amount\" values:\n\n- | FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 73907.19 |\n- | FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 171448.09 |\n- | FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 92277.65 |\n- | FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 191303.24 |\n\n- Add up: 73,907.19 + 171,448.09 + 92,277.65 + 191,303.24 = **454,936.17**\n\nBut on the line for 171,448.09, the \"FixedAsset20231231001\" code is the same as for the 73,907.19 and 191,303.24 amounts, but their \"amount\"s are different and each has a unique \"asset_name\" (Production Line4, Production Line6, Production Line7, Storage Facilities5), so each represents a separate asset purchase.\n\nHence, the sum for cash flow statement purposes (\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\") is:\n\n**73,907.19 + 171,448.09 + 92,277.65 + 191,303.24 = 454,936.17**\n\nHowever, to ensure correct addition (since amounts are to two decimal places), let's add:\n\n- 73,907.19  \n+171,448.09  \n+92,277.65  \n+191,303.24  \n--------------\n= 454,936.17\n\n**Final answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"454936.17\"} }\n```\n\n> If you had a typo or wanted to round up to two decimals, the answer remains **454936.17**.\n\n---\n\nThe previous draft said 454,936.98. That was a typo in summing up, so the correct sum is **454,936.17**.\n\n**Final JSON:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"454936.17\"} }\n```\n",
