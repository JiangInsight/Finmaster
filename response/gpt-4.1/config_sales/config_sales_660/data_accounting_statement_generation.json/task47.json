2,610,647.21\n\n**Calculation:**\n8,000,000.00  \n+ 2,924,781.66  \n- 2,610,647.21  \n= **8,314,134.45**\n\n---\n\n# FINAL ANSWER\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"8314134.45\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Notes/checks:**\n- We have assumed all payment methods 'Cash' and 'Bank Transfer' are included as 'cash and cash equivalents' per typical definition.\n- \"Unpaid\" rows do **not** affect cash–they’re only accruals.\n- Only 'Paid' and 'Cash/Bank Transfer' outflows are counted as actual payments.\n- Only \"Paid\" and immediate \"Cash\" sales are counted as cash receipts.\n\n---\n\n**If you have a specific view of \"cash only\" rather than \"cash & cash equivalents,\" deduct (or add) accordingly to treat bank movements. Here, bank transfers are included.**",
