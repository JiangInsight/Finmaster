Quick Ratio\n\nFormula:  \nQuick Ratio = (Cash + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities\n\n- Cash on Hand = 5,603,438.00\n- Bank Deposits = 3,642,142.45\n- Accounts Receivable = 1,355,463.34\n- Interest Receivable = 10,710.07\n- Total Current Liabilities = 2,110,671.05\n\nSum of Quick Assets (excludes Inventory):  \n= 5,603,438.00 + 3,642,142.45 + 1,355,463.34 + 10,710.07  \n= 10,611,753.86\n\nQuick Ratio = 10,611,753.86 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 5.03\n\nHowever, double-checking the 'Total Current Assets' row: It's 10,906,753.86, but includes inventory (295,000.00), so  \nQuick Assets = 10,906,753.86 - 295,000.00 = 10,611,753.86\n\nSo  \nQuick Ratio = 10,611,753.86 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 5.03\n\nBut the sum of cash on hand and bank deposits is:  \n5,603,438.00 + 3,642,142.45 = 9,245,580.45  \nAdd Accounts Receivable: 1,355,463.34  \nAdd Interest Receivable: 10,710.07  \nTotal = 9,245,580.45 + 1,355,463.34 + 10,710.07 = 10,611,753.86\n\nMatches above.\n\nTherefore,\nQuick Ratio = 10,611,753.86 / 2,110,671.05 = 5.030\n\nBut for standard business analysis, double-check if the question wants only more liquid assets (Cash and Bank only), or to include receivables (according to standard meaning: YES, accounts receivable and interest receivable are included).\n\nTo present with two decimals as in the example:\nQuick Ratio = 5.03\n\n#### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\nFormula:  \nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Revenue) × 100%\n\nFrom income statement:  \n- Net Profit = 1,103,190.60  \n- Main Business Revenue (Total Revenue) = 5,813,420.67  \n\nNet Profit Margin = (1,103,190.60 / 5,813,420.67) × 100% ≈ 18.97%\n\n---\n\n**Final answers:**\n- Quick Ratio: 5.03\n- Net Profit Margin: 18.97%\n\n***Update the solution for formatting as in the instruction:***\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Quick Ratio\": \"5.03\", \"Net Profit Margin\": \"18.97%\"} }\n```",
