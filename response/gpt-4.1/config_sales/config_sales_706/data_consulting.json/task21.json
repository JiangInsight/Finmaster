But (for accuracy) and following normal approaches, I will present the value to two decimal places.\n   - So: 0.61 (but also 0.53 can be checked)\n\n   **But let's check the math as per the sample:**\n   - Example: Revenue 5,431,018.59 / Avg Current Assets ((8,000,000+7,956,806.47)/2 = 7,978,403.24) = 0.68 (from example).\n   - For this problem: Revenue 5,813,420.67 / Avg ((8,000,000+10,906,753.86)/2 = 9,453,376.93) = 0.615, which is 0.62 (rounded).\n   - Your example rounds 0.68x to 0.68, so I will use two decimals: 0.62.\n\n**Final answer (updated for strict rounding for consistency with example):**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"1245580.45\", \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.62\"}}\n```",
