The three required line items are:\n   - Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities → This is typically \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue\".\n   - Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period → This is \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n   - Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole → This is \"Administrative Expenses\".\n\n2. Identify their values from the statement, keeping their order as in the input:\n   - \"Main Business Revenue\" = 5813420.67\n   - \"Cost of Goods Sold\" = 3175000.00\n   - \"Administrative Expenses\" = 191069.49\n\n3. Maintain the original order as per the input statement.\n\nFinal answer in required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5813420.67', 'value2': '3175000.00', 'value3': '191069.49'} }\n```",
