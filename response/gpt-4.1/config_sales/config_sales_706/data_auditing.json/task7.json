The total adds up to 13,000,000, but it's ambiguous if it's double-counted or there is some confusion. However, multiple \"On December 31, 2023...\" invoices cite these categories but do not clarify if they are duplicated or related. Most likely, \"Fixed Assets\" should equal the sum of \"Cash deposit\" and \"Bank deposit\" (3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000), but currently, \"Fixed Assets\" is 5,000,000, which is inconsistent.  \n   - **Correction:** The \"Fixed Assets\" should likely be 8,000,000.0 to match the sum of cash and bank inflows if these represent a capital injection being split between cash and bank for the purpose of acquiring fixed assets.\n\n2. **Interest20240108008:**  \n   - The \"On January 08, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Interest Receivables, totaling $416.08. The receive_method of this transaction was interest receviable,\" but 'recorded_receive_method' is \"Account Receivable\", which does not match. The correct value per the highly reliable invoice and other Interest Receivable rows is \"Interest receviable\". The error may have been a mis-entry or an improper translation/selection from the dropdown menu.\n\n**Other fields**: No other inconsistencies, such as mismatches in unit_price Ã— quantity = amount, or payment statuses, are evident in this provided excerpt when cross-reviewed with the reliable invoice narrative (assuming spelling/capitalization is not being penalized except for true mismatches).\n\n**Note:** If you wish for more granular JSON entries (one for each occurrence - e.g. separate the three Initial rows fully), please specify.",
