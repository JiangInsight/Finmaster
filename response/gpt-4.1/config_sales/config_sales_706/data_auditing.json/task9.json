The invoice explicitly details the total sale, cost, and the specific tax (\"The cost amount for this transaction was $100,000.00, with a tax amount of $8,850.10, leading to a total amount due of $168,151.86.\") The recorded_tax_amount, however, is the same as the gross sale amount, which is incorrect.\n- **Estimate of correct value**: The original tax amount \"8850.10\" from the invoice should be correct.\n- **Other columns**: All other fields appear consistent and supported by the invoice.\n\n**No other internal inconsistencies are detected in the provided rows.
