The cost amount for this transaction was $20000.00, with a tax amount of $1969.75, leading to a total amount due of $37425.15. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"*\n- However, the `recorded_type` is \"Sales Expenses\" instead of \"Sale\".  \n- The invoice is typically more reliable; so the transaction type should be `\"Sale\"`.\n- Other columns (amount, quantity, unit price, etc.) match; thus, only the \"category\" (`recorded_type`) is clearly incorrect.\n\n_No other inconsistencies are visible in the provided data compared to the invoice lines and the tabular entries._",
