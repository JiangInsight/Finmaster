Transaction \"Sale20240111034\":\n- **recorded_amount**: 234636.19\n- **invoice description**: \"an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $98033.67, totaling $196067.34...\"\n- 2.0 × 98033.67 = 196067.34 ≠ 234636.19\n- **recorded_payment/receipt_status**: Unpaid\n- **invoice**: \"...The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n  - So the transaction was \"paid\", not \"unpaid\".\n\nTherefore:\n- **Recorded amount** should be 196067.34 (per invoice/right math)\n- **Recorded payment/receipt_status** should be \"Paid\" (per invoice)\n- All other fields are correct or not applicable\n\n### Step 3: Output the solution as required\n\n- Note: If there are more than one inconsistency per row, report all for that row.\n- Use null for not applicable/missing values as above.\n\n### Step 4: Check for other inconsistencies\n\nOn close read of the sample `problem` block, this is the only inconsistency present. All other rows match invoice details with data.\n\n### Step 5: Format output\n\nOutput as a list (array) in 'solution' field, with all info as specified above. \n\n--- \n\n**If more inconsistencies were present, they'd also get an object like the one above in the array.**",
