However, there are three separate records:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.0\n\nBut by the nature of initial entries, these should balance out and not imply the company suddenly has 13,000,000.0 in assets (3M + 5M + 5M). Usually, the sum of \"Cash deposit + Bank deposit\" should equal \"Fixed Assets + Equity\" for initial capital formation, which they do not clearly explain or balance in these entries. The invoice on each single line only mentions that value, but the multiple entries sharing the same ID with inconsistent amounts is an inconsistency.\n\nIf these entries are all part of the same initial capital registration, the issue is they reuse the same ID, have distinct amounts, all have invoices matching the line amount, but don't clarify the offset. Since the invoice for each line matches its own amount, those are probably correct per line, but the IDs are not uniquely identifying specific transactions as required: **same ID for three different categories and values**.\n\nThus:\n- **id**: \"Initial20231231001\"\n- **Incorrect field**: id (shared across three disparate entries/categories/amounts)\n- **Recorded values**: as above\n- **Best estimate of correct value**: Each line should have its own unique ID, or the amounts should reconcile to a single initial capital record reflecting the company's real opening status.\n\nNo other rows in your sample have invoice/category/field-level inconsistencies at the transaction-level; most other values match line-to-description. Some fields for expense lines list different preparers, but these match the invoice description. All `Sale` lines, cost/quantity/unit_price/tax lines, reconcile.\n\nThis answer focuses on the only internal inconsistency present: a major record ID re-used for multiple distinct entries, which should NOT happen in a good accounting system.",
