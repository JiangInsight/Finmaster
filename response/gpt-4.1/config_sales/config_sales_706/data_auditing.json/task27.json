The cost amount for this transaction was $150000.00, with a tax amount of $13315.54, leading to a total amount due of $252995.27. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- Table row says: | Sale20240124092 | Purchase | ... | 285879.94 | ... | 3.0 | 75478.66 | ...\n- Issues:\n    - Category/Type: Should be \"Sale\", recorded as \"Purchase\".\n    - Price: Invoice unit price is 88770.27, recorded as 75478.66.\n    - Amount: Invoice amount is 266310.81 (= 3 * 88770.27), recorded amount is 285879.94.\n- Other fields (date, payment_method, quantity, etc.) are not clearly in contradiction or not fully observable. Leave as null.\n- Tax and profit are not visible (hence null).\n- Preparer/Approver not specified.\n- Receive method is the same type (\"cash\"), but not shown in the recorded row, so left as null.\n\nThis matches the pattern in the provided example outputs.",
