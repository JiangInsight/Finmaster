Profit by calculation should be 18,699.29 - 10,000.00 = 8,699.29 as per the invoice.\n- All other fields (date, payment/receipt status, receive method, etc.) agree between the table and the invoice.\n- So the answer above captures all the detected inconsistencies and what the correct values should be, referencing the invoice, which is more reliable.\n```",
