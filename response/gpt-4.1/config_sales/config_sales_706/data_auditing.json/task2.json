The standard is one row/transaction. Either the deposit category is misclassified or these are incorrectly split. This suggests an internal recording error (duplicate ID, sum mismatch). The invoice shows all three activities happened on the same day.\n\n2. **Interest20240114014**: The recorded date is \"2024-02-03\", but the invoice and the ID both indicate \"2024-01-14\" (the ID encodes \"20240114\", and invoices are typically most reliable for dating). Therefore, the recorded date should be corrected to \"2024-01-14\" as per invoice and consistent entries.\n\n**No other clear internal inconsistencies are found given the data provided, as most values follow logical cross-checks for quantities Ã— price = amount, cost amounts, tax, etc. Repeating similar styles to the example given.**",
