This is a small mismatch (possibly typo). As per invoice, the correct value is 45749.76.\n- **Sale20240115051**:  \n  - The invoice states \"On January 15, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Sale, consisting of 3.0 units at a unit price of $98095.74, totaling $294287.22...\"  \n  - However, in the row, \"recorded_unit_price\" is 111668.02 and \"recorded_date\" is 2024-02-14 (but id and the invoice say Jan 15, 2024).  \n  - This is an internal inconsistency; From the id and invoice, the best estimate is:\n    - date: \"2024-01-15\"\n    - unit price: \"98095.74\"  \n  - Other values are consistent.\n\n**No other inconsistencies in other lines (checked deposit, purchase, and sale lines, always amounts/unit prices/date match invoice, except the above ones).**",
