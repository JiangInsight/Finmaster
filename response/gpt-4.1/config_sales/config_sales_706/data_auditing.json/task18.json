The remaining rows examined seem to have correct internal logic and matching invoice, so no other rows are output.\n\n---\n\nIf you need a more condensed version (only audits when there are **real inconsistencies**), then the only output is for **Sale20240107019**. If you need all rows audited, then output as above.\n\n**Bottom line: in this sample, only Sale20240107019 has a true consistency issue between fields and the invoice.** The multiple Initial20231231001 rows with different types may indicate a system error or split initial capital contributions, but as the invoice matches the data exactly (just with duplicated IDs), it's not truly an internal *field* inconsistency for each row. If you prefer only the \"error\" rows, let me know!",
