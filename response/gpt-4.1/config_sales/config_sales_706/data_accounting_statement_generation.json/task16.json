It is typically set at the company's founding and only changes if there is a formal capital injection/resolution (new shares, additional investor money, etc.).\n\n2. **Where is Paid-in Capital in the Data?**\n   - It is *not* affected by sales, purchases, expenses, asset purchases (unless thereâ€™s a formal investor contribution).\n   - It is captured in opening balances, usually identified by entries like \"Initial\" or \"Capital injection.\"\n\n3. **Initial Value:**\n   - The first three lines are \"Initial20231231001\" and describe:\n     - Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n     - Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n     - Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.0\n   - These sum to 13,000,000.0, which matches a typical paid-in capital breakdown (cash, cash in bank, and fixed asset at start-up).\n\n4. **Are There Any Additional Capital Entries?**\n   - Scan the entire data for any other entries like \"Capital Increase\", \"Capital Injection\", \"Shareholder Investment\", or any new \"Initial\" or equity-raising transaction.\n   - There are none in the provided dataset; all other transactions are operational (sales, purchases, expenses, asset buys, depreciation, interest, etc.), which do **not** affect paid-in capital.\n\n5. **Final Value:** \n   - Since there are no new capital introduction events or reductions, the paid-in capital at the end remains **the same** as at the start.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Paid-in Capital Initial Value**: 13,000,000.00  \n- **Paid-in Capital End Value**: 13,000,000.00\n\n- Decimal format as per financial reporting: \"13000000.00\"\n\n---\n\nThus, the result is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"13000000.00\"}}\n```",
