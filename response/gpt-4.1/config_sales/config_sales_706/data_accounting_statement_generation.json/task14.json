However, let's check if any Purchase marked as \"Unpaid\" was later paid (but in this data, the payment status at purchase seems final).\n\n*All \"Unpaid\" purchases occur on 2023-12-31. No corresponding \"Paid\" actions for the same Purchase ID occur later, so unless instructions indicate otherwise, current liabilities stay as originally established unless paid.*\n\nAlso, **no new unpaid purchases** after 2023-12-31.\n\n### **New Unpaid Purchases (if any)**\n- None after 2023-12-31.\n\n### **Summary for Ending:**\n\nBecause there are no payments made on those payables (no cash outflows marked as settling AP), and no new payables raised after 2023-12-31, the list of \"Unpaid\" purchases above remain as the ending current liabilities.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Final Check\n\n- **Interest Receivables marked as \"Unpaid\" are not liabilities, they are classified on the asset side.**\n- All other expenses are already paid or are not payables.\n- No evidence of outward payments for these specific purchase payables via a marked \"accounts payable\" payment in any record.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Values**:\n\n- **Total Current Liabilities Initial Value**: `'1,820,000.00'`\n- **Total Current Liabilities End Value**: `'1,820,000.00'`\n\n---\n\n### **JSON Solution:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"1820000.00\", \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"1820000.00\"} }\n```",
