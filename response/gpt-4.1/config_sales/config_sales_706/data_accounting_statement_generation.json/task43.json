Identify relevant transactions:\n\n**Include:**\n- Sales *actually* received in cash (Paid, Cash, etc)\n- Cash paid for expenses (sales, admin, financial)\n- Purchases, only when paid in cash (supplier payment with Cash/Bank Transfer)\n- Ignore \"Unpaid\" for cash calculation (unless it's a reversal).\n- Depreciation and provisions: Non-cash, add back if they're deducting profit (need profit/income data).\n- Interest Receivables: Ignore unless cash received.\n- Ignore internal transfers and non-operating/fixed asset purchases.\n\n**Notes:**\n- Fixed asset purchases should NOT be included (investing cash flow).\n- Account for only real cash movements for operating items.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2.
