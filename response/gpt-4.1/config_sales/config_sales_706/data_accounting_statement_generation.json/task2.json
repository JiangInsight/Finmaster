                        "content": "Let's solve the problem step by step as instructed.\n\n## 1. Find the Initial Value of Bank Deposits\n\nFrom the data, initial lines:\n```\n| Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0 | ...\n```\n**Initial value = 5,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify All Transactions Affecting Bank Deposits\n\nBank Deposits in the balance sheet reflect the net cash balance in bank accounts. So all receipts into or payments from the bank account have to be considered. Let’s clarify the approach:\n\n- **INCREASES**: \n    - Incoming bank receipts that actually impact the bank balance.\n    - Payments received from customers by bank transfer (not shown in the provided data—all sales appear to be by cash or account receivable).\n    - Transfers from cash to bank (e.g., \"FixedAsset...Bank Transfer\" increases fixed assets, but decreases bank balance).\n    - Other explicit bank transfer-in transactions if listed (not apparent).\n\n- **DECREASES**:\n    - Payments TO suppliers by \"Bank Transfer\"\n    - Fixed Asset Purchases by \"Bank Transfer\"\n    - Any other \"Paid\" transactions with \"payment_method\" == \"Bank Transfer\" (withdrawals from the bank account).\n\n**Note:** Payments/receipts via cash, account receivable/payable, or not paid yet, do NOT affect bank balance.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Extract All Bank-Related Transactions\n\nLet’s go through all lines and select those:\n- With \"payment_method\" == \"Bank Transfer\" (and status Paid)\n- Or, for Fixed Asset Purchases, even if not explicit, as above.\n\n### 3.1 Purchases Paid by Bank Transfer\n\nCheck for purchases with \"Bank Transfer\" and \"Paid\":\n\n- Purchase20231231002: 40,000.0\n- Purchase20231231005: 45,000.0\n- Purchase20231231006: 140,000.0\n- Purchase20231231007: 100,000.0\n- Purchase20231231010: 500,000.0\n- Purchase20231231012: 60,000.0\n- Purchase20231231022: 120,000.0 (Bank Transfer + Paid)\n\nSum these up:\n- 40,000\n- 45,000\n- 140,000\n- 100,000\n- 500,000\n- 60,000\n- 120,000\n= **1,005,000.0** (for purchases).\n\n### 3.2 Fixed Asset Purchases Paid by Bank Transfer\n\n- FixedAsset20231231001: 352,857.55 (\"Bank Transfer\", \"Paid\"): **352,857.55**\n\nSum for Fixed Assets: **352,857.55**\n\n### 3.3 TOTAL BANK OUTFLOW\n\nSum: 1,005,000.0 + 352,857.55 = **1,357,857.55**\n\n---\n\n### 3.4 Any Other Bank Inflows? (Transfer from cash movement in)\n\nIn this dataset, there are **no transfers from cash to bank**: i.e. no \"Cash to Bank Transfer\" entries as in the sample. Also, all \"Sale\" transactions paid are by cash; no customer payments directly to \"Bank Transfer\".\n\n**So, no explicit cash->bank transfer in the data.**\n\n---\n\n## 4. Calculate The Final Value\n\n**Start with Initial Bank Deposits:** 5,000,000.00  \n**Subtract all outflows (Paid via Bank Transfer):** 1,357,857.55\n\n**End Value = 5,000,000.00 - 1,357,857.55 = 3,642,142.45**\n\n---\n\n## 5. Final JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"3642142.45\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n**EXPLANATION:**  \n- Only payments with \"Paid\" status and \"Bank Transfer\" method reduce the bank balance.\n- All other \"Paid\" transactions are \"Cash\" (do not affect the bank deposit), or are \"Unpaid\" (no cash flow yet).\n- No explicit receipts or transfers into the bank are present, so only the outflows are counted.\n\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"3642142.45\"} }\n```",
