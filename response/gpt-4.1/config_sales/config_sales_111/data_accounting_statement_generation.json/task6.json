To simplify, since all purchase payments are recorded as either bank or cash, and \"cash to bank transfer\" shows transfers, let's treat transfers as internal (not affecting total current assets).**\n\n#### **3.a. Sum receipts (inflow) to cash (from sales):**\n\n**A. Sales Paid by Cash**\nAll sales with \"receive_method: Cash\" (could be Paid) and all those with “Paid” status.\n\nBut sometimes the \"paid\" status may just note it's been paid; actual payment method is in \"receive_method\" or \"payment_method\".\n\nTo be safe, total cash received = sum for all sales with 'Cash' in receive_method OR payment_method.  \nBank sales would have outcome in bank account.\n\n**Let's sum up:**\n\nCheck sales for \"receive_method: Cash\" OR for which payment_method = Cash.\n\nAlternatively, sum all \"Paid\" sales in the period --- but where did the payment actually go, bank or cash?\n\nThe sales \"Paid\" categorization implies immediate receipt to cash or bank as specified.\n\n**To be precise:**\n- For each sale, add to either cash or bank depending on \"receive_method\".\n- For all \"Unpaid\"/\"Account Receivable\" sales, these increase A/R (receivables), not cash/bank.\n\n**Let's split:**\n\n#### **Cash receipts from customers = All Sales where receive_method = Cash**\n- sum sale amounts where receive_method = 'Cash' (could go through cautiously, but all show 'Cash', bank, or account receivable).\n\n#### **Let’s scan: For each sale, we need**\n- If receive_method == \"Cash\" → Cash\n- Else if receive_method == \"Account Receivable\" → Receivable\n- Otherwise, possibly bank?\n- Note: Bank deposit seems only initial; purchases paid by \"Bank Transfer\" seem to reduce bank.\n\n#### **Given cash and bank are both current assets, combined total matters. Individual balance is not strictly necessary unless required for detail.**\n\nLet's just track total cash+bank over time:\n\n#### **INITIAL:**\n- Cash: 3,000,000\n- Bank: 5,000,000\n- Combined: 8,000,000\n\n#### **Purchases and Fixed Asset Payments:**\n- Paid purchases by \"Cash\" reduce cash.\n- Paid purchases by \"Bank Transfer\" reduce bank.\n- Paid purchases by \"Account Payable\" are unpaid, so affect accounts payable (not affecting cash/bank immediately).\n\nLet's find all purchases (Paid) with payment_method = Cash: \n\n- Purchase20231231001: Paid, Bank Transfer, 40,000 (bank)\n- Purchase20231231006: Paid, Cash, 500,000 (cash)\n- Purchase20231231007: Paid, Bank Transfer, 70,000 (bank)\n- Purchase20231231011: Paid, Cash,30,000 (cash)\n- Purchase20231231013: Paid, Cash,350,000 (cash)\n- Purchase20231231015: Paid, Cash,180,000 (cash)\n- Purchase20231231016: Paid, Cash,70,000 (cash)\n- Purchase20231231017: Paid, Cash,120,000 (cash)\n- Purchase20231231020: Paid, Bank Transfer,250,000 (bank)\n- Purchase20231231021: Paid, Bank Transfer,500,000 (bank)\n- Purchase20231231023: Paid, Bank Transfer,40,000 (bank)\n- Purchase20231231024: Paid, Bank Transfer,160,000 (bank)\n\nPurchases (Paid) via Cash:\n- 500,000\n- 30,000\n- 350,000\n- 180,000\n- 70,000\n- 120,000\n\nSum: 500,000+30,000=530,000+350,000=880,000+180,000=1,060,000+70,000=1,130,000+120,000=**1,250,000**\n\nPurchases (Paid) via Bank Transfer:\n- 40,000\n- 70,000\n- 250,000\n- 500,000\n- 40,000\n- 160,000\n\nSum: 40,000+70,000=110,000+250,000=360,000+500,000=860,000+40,000=900,000+160,000=**1,060,000**\n\nBut let's make sure with the full Paid purchases with Bank Transfer:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 40,000\n- Purchase20231231007: 70,000\n- Purchase20231231020: 250,000\n- Purchase20231231021: 500,000\n- Purchase20231231023: 40,000\n- Purchase20231231024: 160,000\n\nSo, total paid purchases via bank: **1,060,000**\n\n#### **Fixed Assets Paid:**\n- FixedAsset20231231001: 321,724.42 (Processing Equipment) paid Bank Transfer\n- FixedAsset20231231001: 115,740.01 (Production Line) paid Bank Transfer\n\nSo, 321,724.42 + 115,740.01 = **437,464.43** (paid from bank)\n\n#### **Expenses:**\nAll expenses are paid by Cash.\n\nSum all expense \"amount\":\nLet's sum (just the first 5 as a test):\n\n- Expense20240101001: 3,623.3\n- Expense20240101001:20,805.83\n- Expense20240101001:27,596.64\n- Expense20240102001:25,623.25\n- Expense20240102001:23,995.56\n- Expense20240103001:22,391.18\n- Expense20240103001:15,317.72\n...
