What are \"Total Liabilities\" on the Balance Sheet?\n\n**Total Liabilities** typically includes **all payables and outstanding obligations**. In this transactions table, these will be identified as:\n- **Accounts Payable** (\"Account Payable\" in Payment Method for \"Unpaid\" purchases)\n- Any other explicit outstanding obligations (none found here except payables)\n- Interest payable is not separately listed, only \"Interest Receivables\" (an asset)\n- We should exclude any \"Interest Receivable\" and any items already paid (since those are not liabilities).\n\n#### Specifically:\n- Look for all purchase transactions that are **Unpaid** (meaning \"payment/receipt_status\" == \"Unpaid\" AND \"payment_method\" == \"Account Payable\").\n- Sum their **amount**.\n\n#### Initial Liabilities:\n- In most company setups, you only have initial assets (cash, bank, fixed assets), unless a line clearly shows an initial liability (such as \"Initial Borrowings\" or \"Initial Payable\").\n- In this table, only assets are listed as \"Initial\" rows. **No initial liabilities** are present.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Find all relevant Purchase transactions that increase Liabilities\n\n**Criteria:**\n- Type: \"Purchase\"\n- Payment/Receipt Status: \"Unpaid\"\n- Payment Method: \"Account Payable\"\n- Sum the \"amount\" USD.\n\n---\n\n#### Let's find all relevant lines:\n\nLet's go through all purchase entries:\n\n| id                | type     | amount   | payment/receipt_status | payment_method | Comment |\n|-------------------|----------|----------|-----------------------|----------------|---------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | Purchase  | 40000.0 | Paid                  | Bank Transfer  | Not unpaid, not AP |\n| Purchase20231231002 | Purchase  | 60000.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable| YES   |\n| Purchase20231231003 | Purchase  | 60000.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable| YES   |\n| Purchase20231231004 | Purchase  | 100000.0| Unpaid                | Account Payable| YES   |\n| Purchase20231231005 | Purchase  | 45000.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable| YES   |\n| Purchase20231231006 | Purchase  | 500000.0| Paid                  | Cash           | No     |\n| Purchase20231231007 | Purchase  | 70000.0 | Paid                  | Bank Transfer  | No     |\n| Purchase20231231008 | Purchase  | 20000.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable| YES   |\n| Purchase20231231009 | Purchase  | 160000.0| Unpaid                | Account Payable| YES   |\n| Purchase20231231010 | Purchase  | 250000.0| Unpaid                | Account Payable| YES   |\n| Purchase20231231011 | Purchase  | 30000.0 | Paid                  | Cash           | No     |\n| Purchase20231231012 | Purchase  | 140000.0| Unpaid                | Account Payable| YES   |\n| Purchase20231231013 | Purchase  | 350000.0| Paid                  | Cash           | No     |\n| Purchase20231231014 | Purchase  | 30000.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable| YES   |\n| Purchase20231231015 | Purchase  | 180000.0| Paid                  | Cash           | No     |\n| Purchase20231231016 | Purchase  | 70000.0 | Paid                  | Cash           | No     |\n| Purchase20231231017 | Purchase  | 120000.0| Paid                  | Cash           | No     |\n| Purchase20231231018 | Purchase  | 150000.0| Unpaid                | Account Payable| YES   |\n| Purchase20231231019 | Purchase  | 200000.0| Unpaid                | Account Payable| YES   |\n| Purchase20231231020 | Purchase  | 250000.0| Paid                  | Bank Transfer  | No     |\n| Purchase20231231021 | Purchase  | 500000.0| Paid                  | Bank Transfer  | No     |\n| Purchase20231231022 | Purchase  | 45000.0 | Unpaid                | Account Payable| YES   |\n| Purchase20231231023 | Purchase  | 40000.0 | Paid                  | Bank Transfer  | No     |\n| Purchase20231231024 | Purchase  | 160000.0| Paid                  | Bank Transfer  | No     |\n\nNow, sum up all \"YES\" lines:\n\n- 60000.0\n- 60000.0\n- 100000.0\n- 45000.0\n- 20000.0\n- 160000.0\n- 250000.0\n- 140000.0\n- 30000.0\n- 150000.0\n- 200000.0\n- 45000.0\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n1. 60000.0\n2. +60000.0 = 120000.0\n3. +100000.0 = 220000.0\n4. +45000.0 = 265000.0\n5. +20000.0 = 285000.0\n6. +160000.0 = 445000.0\n7. +250000.0 = 695000.0\n8. +140000.0 = 835000.0\n9. +30000.0 = 865000.0\n10. +150000.0 = 1,015,000.0\n11. +200000.0 = 1,215,000.0\n12. +45000.0 = 1,260,000.0\n\nThere are 12 \"YES\" lines totaling **1,260,000.0**\n\n#### Let's verify no lines are missed:\nCounting \"YES\" lines:\n1. 60000\n2. 60000\n3. 100000\n4. 45000\n5. 20000\n6. 160000\n7. 250000\n8. 140000\n9. 30000\n10. 150000\n11. 200000\n12. 45000\n\nYes, 12 lines.\n\n---\n\n### 3.
