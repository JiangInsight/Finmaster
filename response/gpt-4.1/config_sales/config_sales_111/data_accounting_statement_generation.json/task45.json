                        "content": "Let's solve the task step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Definition\n\n- **Net Cash Flows from Investing Activities** in a cash flow statement typically includes cash payments to acquire/construct long-term assets (such as fixed assets, equipment, property, etc.), cash receipts from sales of those assets, and sometimes investments in securities or similar.\n\n- Purchases of regular inventory/products for resale are NOT investing; they're operating activities.\n- Equipment/fixed asset purchases ARE investing.\n\n## Step 2: Identify Investing Activities Transactions\n\nFrom your data, we need to identify lines related to investment in fixed assets (usually type like \"Fixed Assets Purchase\") and sum CASH used for those.\n\n### Scan for Fixed Assets/Fixed Asset Purchases\n\nLet's look through the \"type\" field for fixed asset purchases:\n\n#### 1. Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 ... | amount: 5,000,000.0\n- This is an opening balance, not a cash movement during the period. **SKIP**\n\n#### 2. FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 ... | amount: 321,724.42\n- This is a cash outflow for fixed assets purchase (investing activity); should include.\n\n#### 3. FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 ... | amount: 115,740.01\n- Another cash outflow for fixed assets purchase (investing activity); should include.\n\n#### 4. Depreciation... and any Interest Receivables\n- These are NOT investing activities. **SKIP**\n\n#### Rest are regular \"Purchase\" or \"Expense\" of inventory or operations. Purchases of products are not investing activities. **SKIP**\n\n## Step 3: Add Up Cash Flows from Investing Activities\n\nOnly the purchases of fixed assets (using cash or bank) count.\n\n- **FixedAsset20231231001: 321,724.42** (Paid | Bank Transfer)\n- **FixedAsset20231231001: 115,740.01** (Paid | Bank Transfer)\n\nTotal net cash flow from investing activities = outflows = - (321,724.42 + 115,740.01)\n\n## Step 4: Calculation\n\n321,724.42  \n+115,740.01  \n= 437,464.43\n\nAs these are **cash outflows**, the net cash flow from investing activities is **-437,464.43**.\n\n## Step 5: JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-437464.43\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": \"-437464.43\"} }\n```",
