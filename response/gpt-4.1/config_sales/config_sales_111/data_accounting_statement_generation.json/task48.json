                        "content": "Let's solve step by step.  \nWe need to calculate the *net increase in cash and cash equivalents* as it would appear on a cash flow statement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Opening Balance**\n\nFrom the data:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000\n\nSo, Opening balance of cash and cash equivalents = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = **8,000,000**\n\n**Step 2: Cash Inflows**\n\nFind all **CASH INFLOWS**:\n\nThese are receipts related to \"Sale\" transactions where \"Paid\" and \"Cash\" or related (not \"Account Receivable\"!) AND \"Paid\" purchases/sales, etc.   \n- For sales: use only the *cash* part of \"Paid\" sales.\n- Purchases are cash OUTFLOWS, not inflows.\n- Ignore \"Unpaid\"/\"Account Receivable\" sales for cash movement now.\n- For fixed asset purchases: Outflow!\n- Ignore \"Interest Receivables\" (unpaid).\n\nSo, sum up all **sales with Paid status** (i.e., cash inflows):\n\nFrom the data, each \"Sale\" lists \"Paid\" status and sometimes shows the mode (e.g., Cash or Bank). Assume all \"Paid\" are immediate cash/bank inflows, regardless if it says 10,000, 50,000 etc.\n\nBut for these example-like statements (see row:  \n| Sale20240102003 | ... | amount | ... | Paid | | 20000 | ... |),  \nPaid means amount is actually received.\n\nBut, in actual practice, in the provided sample, we ***take the full amount of any Sale with \"Paid\" status as cash in***—as shown in the example.  \n\nLet me extract and sum all the relevant \"Sale\" records with Paid status.\n\nLet's look for all rows with:\n- type: \"Sale\"\n- payment/receipt_status: \"Paid\"\n\nI will extract and

But the question is about the *net increase in cash and cash equivalents*, i.e., the ***difference between closing and opening balance during the period***.\n\nClosing balance = (Opening balance + Inflows - Outflows)\n\nBut... the data only provides \"opening balances\" as initial cash = 3,000,000 and bank 5,000,000.\n\nIs there any cash to bank transfer or similar? In this dataset, does not appear.\n\n(Based on the example, Opening balance is 8,000,000, then all subsequent cash movements are calculated for Net Increase.)\n\nSo, the result is *\"Net Increase in cash and cash equivalents for the period\"* = Inflows - Outflows = **-199,503.10**\n\n**Step 5: Format the answer**\n\nThus:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Increase': '-199503.10'} }\n```\n\n---\n\n### Double-check: Did I miss any bank transfers or cash-to-bank or similar entries?\n\n- \"Bank Transfer\" mentioned as payment_method for purchases; but these are already included as cash equivalents (same as \"Cash\" for CFS).\n- No explicit \"Cash to bank transfer\" lines (these would be a transfer within cash equivalents, no effect on net increase).\n\n**Therefore, this calculation is proper.**  \n\n---\n\n## Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Increase': '-199503.10'} }\n```",
