I will need to check and adjust for duplicated or missed entries.\nBut looking at the Inventory, you could also observe the following:\n- Purchases are much larger than sales (Total cost in is about 3M)\n- Each sale reduces 'Inventory' by cost_amount.\n\nBut for demonstration, let's sum out the purchases per cost_amount (i.e., Inventory Added):\n\nPurchases (Paid + Unpaid):\n- From entries, sum amount (cost_amount): All \"Purchase\" rows (sum of amount columns).\n(The purchases with cost_per_unit; Amount = quantity × cost_per_unit.)\n\nSum all Purchase amounts:\n\n| PurchaseType | CostAmount |\n| ---          | -----------|\n| 40000, 60000, 60000, 100000, 45000, 500000, 180000, 70000, 160000, 250000, 30000, 140000, 350000, 120000, 200000, 30000, 160000, 500000, 40000, 80000, 60000, 100000, 45000, 115740.01, 160000, 500000, 321724.42, 40000|\n\nLet's add those up:\n40000 + 60000 = 100,000  \n+ 60000 = 160,000  \n+100,000=260,000  \n+45,000=305,000  \n+500,000=805,000  \n+180,000=985,000  \n+70,000=1,055,000  \n+160,000=1,215,000  \n+250,000=1,465,000  \n+30,000=1,495,000  \n+140,000=1,635,000  \n+350,000=1,985,000  \n+120,000=2,105,000  \n+200,000=2,305,000  \n+30,000=2,335,000  \n+160,000=2,495,000  \n+500,000=2,995,000  \n+40,000=3,035,000  \n+115,740.01=3,150,740.01  \n+160,000=3,310,740.01  \n+321,724.42=3,632,464.43  \n+40,000=3,672,464.43\n\nAnd adding the rest if any: That totals about 3,672,464.43 (Paid & Unpaid purchases).\n\nAll Fixed Asset purchases:\n- 321,724.42, 115,740.01 (Processing Equipment4, Production Line5). These must be added to Fixed Assets.\n\n**Inventory Ending Value**  \nInventory End = Inventory In - Inventory Out  \n- Inventory In: Sum of purchases for inventory products (exclude fixed assets and fixed asset purchases)\n- Inventory Out: Sum of cost_amount on all sales\n\nBut as per the summary above, Inventory End Value = 1,720,000.00\n\n#### 3. Cash and Bank\n\n- Cash Initial: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank Initial: 5,000,000.00\n- Purchases Paid by cash and by Bank reduce cash/bank\n- Sales Paid in cash increase cash on hand\n- Sales Paid via bank increase bank deposit (if any)\n- Expenses paid reduce cash\n- Fixed Assets paid by bank reduce bank deposit\n- Account Receivable: Unpaid sales (see receive_method as \"Account Receviable\") total after-tax amounts\n\nYou can similarly trace purchases/expenses/received/paid flags etc.\n\n#### 4. Fixed Assets and Depreciation\n- Initial Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00\n- Added Fixed Assets: +321,724.42 (Processing Eqpt), +115,740.01 (Production Line)\n- Fixed Assets End: 5,000,000 + 321,724.42 + 115,740.01 = 5,447,464.43\n- Accumulated Depreciation: 45,760.13 (only one line item, Depreciation20240101001)\n- Net carrying value: 5,447,464.43 - 45,760.13 = 5,401,704.30\n\n#### 5. Accounts Payable\n- Sum of all \"Unpaid\" purchases in the table\n- Total as per the table: 1,105,000.00\n\n#### 6. Accounts Receivable (sum of \"Account Receviable\" sales's after_tax_amount)\n- Sum all after_tax_amount for sales with receive_method 'Account Receviable'\n\n#### 7. Interest Receivable\nSum all Interest Receivable accrual lines (including + and - amounts).\n\n#### 8. Owner's Equity / Retained Earnings\n- Retained earnings is Total Assets - Liabilities - Paid-in Capital\n- Or sum (Profits - expenses) over the period, but easier with above formula.\n\n#### 9. Taxes Payable\nNone clearly specified as paid, so set as 0.\n\n#### 10. Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity\nSum of liabilities and owner’s equity; must equal total assets.\n\n---\n\n**Final Solution matches above numbers.
