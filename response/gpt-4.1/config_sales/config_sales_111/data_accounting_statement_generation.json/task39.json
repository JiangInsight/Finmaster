What does “(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable” mean in cash flow statements?\n\n- If Interest Receivable increases compared to prior period, it means more interest revenue has been recognized but not yet collected in cash → subtract this increase from operating cash flow.\n- If it decreases, it means cash was collected from previously accrued interest → add this to operating cash flow.\n\nSo, “(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable” = (Interest Receivable balance at period end) - (Interest Receivable balance at period start)\n\n## 2. Find opening and closing Interest Receivable balances\n\n- Start: **2024-01-01** (first day with a balance for this period)\n- End: **2024-01-28** (last day in the sample)\n\nLook for all transactions of type \"Interest Receivables\" and sum up the balances as they accumulate.\n\n### 2.1. List of all \"Interest Receivables\" entries\n\n#### Opening balance, 2024-01-01:\n\n- Interest20240101001 | 2024-01-01 | amount: 441.44\n\nThis is the only interest receivable on Jan 1, so opening balance = **441.44**\n\n#### During period:\n\nThen, on each day, more \"Interest Receivable\" are added (all with \"Unpaid\" status).\n\nLet's sum up as we go!\n\n| Date         | Amount           | Cumulative Balance |\n|--------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| 2024-01-01   | +441.44          | 441.44            |\n| 2024-01-02   | +441.44          | 882.88            |\n| 2024-01-03   | +441.44          | 1,324.32          |\n| 2024-01-04   | +435.21          | 1,759.53          |\n| 2024-01-05   | +435.21          | 2,194.74          |\n| 2024-01-06   | +435.21          | 2,629.95          |\n| 2024-01-07   | +435.21          | 3,065.16          |\n| 2024-01-08   | +435.21          | 3,500.37          |\n| 2024-01-09   | +435.21          | 3,935.58          |\n| 2024-01-10   | +435.21          | 4,370.79          |\n| 2024-01-11   | +435.21          | 4,806.00          |\n| 2024-01-12   | +435.21          | 5,241.21          |\n| 2024-01-13   | +435.21          | 5,676.42          |\n| 2024-01-14   | +435.21          | 6,111.63          |\n| 2024-01-15   | +435.21          | 6,546.84          |\n| 2024-01-16   | +435.21          | 6,982.05          |\n| 2024-01-17   | +435.21          | 7,417.26          |\n\n#### BUT! On 2024-01-18 the amount is 406.57652662, not 435.21.\n\nSimilarly, on subsequent days, the amount changes.\n\nLet's continue with the amounts as given:\n\n| Date         | Amount           | Cumulative Balance |\n|--------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| 2024-01-18   | +406.57652662    | 7,823.83652662    |\n| 2024-01-19   | +406.57652662    | 8,230.41305324    |\n| 2024-01-20   | +384.32652662    | 8,614.73957986    |\n| 2024-01-21   | +384.32652662    | 8,999.06610648    |\n| 2024-01-22   | +339.82652662    | 9,338.8926331     |\n| 2024-01-23   | +339.82652662    | 9,678.71915972    |\n| 2024-01-24   | +339.82652662    | 10,018.5456863    |\n| 2024-01-25   | +339.82652662    | 10,358.37221292   |\n| 2024-01-26   | +339.82652662    | 10,698.19873954   |\n| 2024-01-27   | +336.26652662    | 11,034.46526616   |\n| 2024-01-28   | +311.72566573    | 11,346.19093189   |\n\n## 3. Final: Calculate increase (change) over the period\n\n**(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable** = Closing - Opening\n= 11,346.19093189 - 441.44\n= **10,904.75093189**\n\nIf reporting as \"increase\", it's negative for cash flow (worsens operating cash flow):\n\nSo, present as a negative number.\n\n## 4. Round as per the example to two decimals\n\n10,904.75 (rounded to 2 decimals)\n\n## 5. Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-10904.75\"}}\n```",
