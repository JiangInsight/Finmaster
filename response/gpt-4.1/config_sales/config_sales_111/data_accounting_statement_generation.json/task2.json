Find Bank Deposits Initial Value\nLook for \"Bank deposit\" entry with initial value.\n\nLooking at the initial entries:\n- `| Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | ... | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0 | ...`\n\n**So, Initial Bank Deposits = 5,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Find All Cash Flow Through Bank (Affecting Bank Deposits)\n\nWe need to add/subtract the following:\n- Outflows via \"Bank Transfer\" or explicitly Paid via \"Bank Transfer\" (purchases, fixed asset)\n- Inflows via customers **to 'Bank'**, but in the table above, almost all sales received as \"Cash\" (\"payment_method\" column), not via bank.\n- Ignore purchases/unpaid/paid via \"cash\" or \"account payable\"—they do not directly change the bank balance.\n- Purchases/expenses/fixed assets \"Paid\" by Bank Transfer reduce the bank deposit.\n\n#### (A) Outflows - Payments by Bank Transfer:\n\nFind all transactions with:\n- \"Paid\" and \"Bank Transfer\" under payment_method (for both Purchase and Fixed Assets).\n- Also adjust for potential duplicate \"FixedAsset\" entry (to avoid double-counting).\n- Paid value is in \"amount\" field.\n\nGo through each transaction:\n\n#### Purchases (Paid/Bank Transfer):\n\n| id             | type             | amount     | payment_method    |\n|----------------|------------------|------------|-------------------|\n| Purchase20231231001 | Purchase       | 40000.0   | Bank Transfer     |\n| Purchase20231231007 | Purchase       | 70000.0   | Bank Transfer     |\n| Purchase20231231020 | Purchase       | 250000.0  | Bank Transfer     |\n| Purchase20231231021 | Purchase       | 500000.0  | Bank Transfer     |\n| Purchase20231231023 | Purchase       | 40000.0   | Bank Transfer     |\n| Purchase20231231024 | Purchase       | 160000.0  | Bank Transfer     |\n| FixedAsset20231231001| Fixed Assets Purchase| 321724.42 | Bank Transfer  |\n| FixedAsset20231231001| Fixed Assets Purchase| 115740.01 | Bank Transfer  |\n\nNote: There are two entries with the same FixedAsset20231231001 but different names and amounts and different asset_name (\"Processing Equipment4\", \"Production Line5\"), so both should be counted.\n\nNow, let's sum them all:\n\n- Purchase20231231001: 40,000.00\n- Purchase20231231007: 70,000.00\n- Purchase20231231020: 250,000.00\n- Purchase20231231021: 500,000.00\n- Purchase20231231023: 40,000.00\n- Purchase20231231024: 160,000.00\n- FixedAsset20231231001 (Processing Equipment4): 321,724.42\n- FixedAsset20231231001 (Production Line5): 115,740.01\n\n**Subtotal of Outflows by Bank Transfer:**\n- 40,000\n- 70,000\n- 250,000\n- 500,000\n- 40,000\n- 160,000\n- 321,724.42\n- 115,740.01\n------------------\nSum: \n\n40,000+70,000=110,000  \n110,000+250,000=360,000  \n360,000+500,000=860,000  \n860,000+40,000=900,000  \n900,000+160,000=1,060,000  \n1,060,000+321,724.42=1,381,724.42  \n1,381,724.42+115,740.01=1,497,464.43  \n\n**Total Paid by Bank Transfer = 1,497,464.43**\n\n---\n\n#### (B) Inflows to Bank\n\nLook for **sales received via \"Bank\" or \"Bank Transfer\"** (not found in this dataset; all sales \"Cash\" or blank), and any other specific inflows—doesn't seem to be any (no \"Cash to bank transfer\" in this table).\n\n---\n\n#### (C) Bank Deposit Increase: None found (no explicit inflows to bank)\n\n---\n\n#### (D) Summing up\n\n**Initial Bank Deposit**: 5,000,000.00  \n**Less**: All bank transfer outflows: 1,497,464.43  \n**Final Bank Deposit** = 5,000,000.00 - 1,497,464.43 = 3,502,535.57\n\n---\n\n### 3. Confirm the answer format\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"3502535.57\"} }\n```\n\n---\n\n## Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Bank Deposits Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Bank Deposits End Value\": \"3502535.57\"} }\n```",
