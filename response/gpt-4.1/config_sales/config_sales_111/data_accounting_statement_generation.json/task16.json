Understanding Paid-in Capital\n- Paid-in capital (Share capital) in the balance sheet usually is **the money that shareholders have invested in the company by purchasing stock**.\n- In accounting, these are typically \"Initial\" transactions like \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", and non-debt \"Fixed Assets\" that make up the initial equity, unless there are explicit additional capital increases or withdrawals.\n- Operating transactions (sales, purchases, expenses, depreciation, interest) do **not** affect paid-in capital.\n\n## 2. Find Initial Paid-in Capital\n\n### Look for \"Initial\" transactions:\n- | Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit        | 2023-12-31 | ... | 3,000,000.0 |\n- | Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit        | 2023-12-31 | ... | 5,000,000.0 |\n- | Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets        | 2023-12-31 | ... | 5,000,000.0 |\n\n#### Add them up:\n- Cash deposit:        3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit:        5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets:        5,000,000.00\n- **Total:**           13,000,000.00\n\n### Check for any Capital Increases or Decreases\n\n#### Review all other transactions (besides Initial):\n- No record of capital withdrawal, additional investment, or \"Owner's Draw\", or \"Paid-in Capital Increase\" events.\n- All other entries are regular business (expenses, revenues, purchases, interest, etc.).\n\n> **Paid-in capital is unchanged by business operations unless a new explicit capital transaction appears, which is not the case.**\n\n## 3. Paid-in Capital End Value\n\n- Remains the same as initial: **13,000,000.00**\n\n## 4. Fill the Solution JSON\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"13000000.00\"} }\n```",
