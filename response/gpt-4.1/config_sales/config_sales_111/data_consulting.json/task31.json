Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n- Formula: `Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable`\n- Here, all revenue is likely credit sales, as opening A/R is 0.\n- Net Credit Sales = Total Revenue = 5,760,023.09\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning + Ending)/2 = (0 + 1,454,443.80)/2 = 727,221.90\n- Ratio = 5,760,023.09 / 727,221.90 ≈ **7.92**  \n_But the prior example used ending balance only when there was 0 opening, thus:_\n- Ratio (using ending only) = 5,760,023.09 / 1,454,443.80 ≈ **3.96**  \n_But the correct method is average, so use **7.92**. However, in the example, the formula is Revenue ÷ A/R end (when A/R begin is 0)._  \n- **Final Answer (matching example)**: 5,760,023.09 / 1,454,443.80 = **3.96**\n\n_Update_: The example (2023 data) calculated using ending balance for ratio since beginning A/R = 0. Let's use the same for consistency.\n\n### 2. Operating cash flow ratio\n- Formula: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Ending Current Liabilities\n- Net Cash Flow from Op. Activities = 803,237.11\n- Ending Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n- Ratio = 803,237.11 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ **0.52**\n\n### 3. Operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\n- This is the same as above: **0.52**\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n- Formula: Net Sales (Revenue) / Average Total Assets\n- Net Sales = 5,760,023.09\n- Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 15,653,266.97)/2 = 14,326,633.49\n- Ratio = 5,760,023.09 / 14,326,633.49 ≈ **0.40**\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n- Formula: Total Liabilities / Owner's Equity (both ending)\n- Total Liabilities (ending) = 1,548,001.20\n- Owner's Equity (ending) = 14,105,265.77\n- Ratio = 1,548,001.20 / 14,105,265.77 ≈ **0.11**\n\n---\n\n**Updating the solution with correct answers using consistent methodology:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.96\",\n  \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"0.52\",\n  \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"0.52\",\n  \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.40\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\"\n}}\n```\n\n**(The ratio 6.04 previously was incorrectly calculated, the above matches the example's approach and the numbers given.)**",
