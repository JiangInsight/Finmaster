Some prefer end inventory only in this startup scenario. Most technically sound: with average, as above.  \nBut to be consistent with your sample (uses End Inventory only when initial is 0), then:\n\nInventory Turnover = 3,140,000 / 430,000 ≈ **7.30**\n\nBut given your example calculated: 4,410,000 / 5,090,000 = 0.87 (\"1.73\" in sample, which is 5,431,018.59 revenue / 5,090,000 inventory = 1.07, doesn't completely match).\n\nI'll use the standard approach: since start inventory is zero and this is first period, one standard convention is just use ending inventory:\n\nInventory Turnover = 3,140,000 / 430,000 ≈ **7.30**\n\nHowever, sometimes people use average: 3,140,000 / 215,000 ≈ **14.60**\n\nBut in your sample with initial inventory 0 and ending 5,090,000, and COGS 4,410,000:  \nYou gave ratio 1.73, which is 4,410,000 / 2,429,482.13 (which is not inventory, that's accounts receivable), but if I do 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 (avg of 0 and 5,090,000) = 1.73.\n\nThus, let's use average inventory:\n\nAverage Inventory = (0 + 430,000) / 2 = 215,000  \nInventory Turnover = 3,140,000/215,000 = **14.60**\n\n**EDIT:** Revisiting -- in your sample, for initial 0, ending 5,090,000, COGS 4,410,000, result is 1.73.  \n4,410,000 / ((0+5,090,000)/2) = 1.73\n\nUsing that method:\n\nInventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory  \nAverage Inventory = (0+430,000)/2 = 215,000\n\nInventory Turnover = 3,140,000/215,000 = **14.60**\n\nBut you posted 9.83, assuming some COGS is used differently? Let's check using Revenue:\n\n5,760,023.09 / ((0+430,000)/2) = 5,760,023.09/215,000 ≈ 26.81 (not matching).\n\nI will use **14.60** as calculated.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Debt to Equity Ratio**\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity = Total Liabilities / Total Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities = 1,548,001.20 (current liabilities only, no other interest-bearing/long-term)\n- Total Equity = 14,105,265.77\n\nCalculation:  \n1,548,001.20 / 14,105,265.77 ≈ **0.11**\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Quick Ratio**\n**Formula:**  \nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\n- Current Assets = 10,261,562.67\n- Inventory = 430,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n\n(10,261,562.67 - 430,000.00) / 1,548,001.20 = 9,831,562.67 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ **6.34**\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Current Ratio**\n**Formula:**  \nCurrent Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nCurrent Assets = 10,261,562.67  \nCurrent Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n\n10,261,562.67 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ **6.63**\n\n---\n\n**Final answers** (rounded to 2 decimal places for ratios except Inventory Turnover):\n\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: **0.52**\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: **0.52**\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio: **14.60**\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: **0.11**\n- Quick Ratio: **6.34**\n- Current Ratio: **6.63**\n\nBut, if you wish to round Inventory Turnover as an integer, provide as \"15\", but conventionally two decimals same as others: **14.60**.\n\n**But in your sample output, only one decimal is retained for ratios**. So rounding to two decimals:\n\n**Edited Final:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"0.52\",\n  \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"0.52\",\n  \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"14.60\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\",\n  \"Quick Ratio\": \"6.34\",\n  \"Current Ratio\": \"6.63\"\n}}\n```",
