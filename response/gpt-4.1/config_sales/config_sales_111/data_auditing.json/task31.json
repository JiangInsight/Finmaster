The cost amount for this transaction was $100,000.00, with a tax amount of $9,245.14, leading to a total amount due of $175,657.62. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\"\n- However, in the recorded fields:\n  - **recorded_quantity**: 1.0, but should be 2.0.\n  - **recorded_unit_price**: 90,326.91, but should be 92,451.38.\n  - **recorded_amount**: 92,451.38 (matches with 1×92,451.38), but should be 184,902.76 (2×92,451.38).\n  - **recorded_tax_amount**: 188,336.46, which is far too high and should be 9,245.14.\n- Other fields can be left null because either they're matching, not available in the record, or there are no inconsistencies detected for them in the context of this row.\n",
