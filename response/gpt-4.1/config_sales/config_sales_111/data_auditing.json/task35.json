The payment_method of this transaction was bank transfer, and this transaction was paid. This transaction was prepared by Senior Staff, and the approver is Director. The supplier ID is S005, and the supplier name is Supplier 5.\"\n- The recorded type is \"Financial Expenses\", but should be \"Purchase\".\n- The recorded date is \"2024-01-10\", should be \"2023-12-31\".\n- Recorded quantity is 8.0, should be 10.0.\n- Recorded price/unit is 58331.09, should be 50000.00.\n- Amount is 614179.59, should be 500000.00.\n- Everything else matches the more trusted source (invoice and its summary), so those are NOT errors.\n- There may be confusion because the product_id/unit price/number all point to a typical Purchase transaction (not a Financial Expense).\n- The correction is based solely on matching per-row invoice summary to row data.\n```",
