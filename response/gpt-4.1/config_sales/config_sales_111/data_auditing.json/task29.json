The invoice field, considered reliable, indicates $3,000,000 for Cash deposit but also entries for $5,000,000 both for Bank deposit and Fixed Assets.\n- This is internally inconsistent: you cannot have three simultaneous records (with the same ID) each for different types with conflicting amounts for a single transaction ID and date.\n- So, the `recorded_amount` for the latter two (\"Bank deposit\" and \"Fixed Assets\") should most likely be $3,000,000, matching the invoice for the ID, or possibly separated (which would require new unique IDs per asset/type for consistency).\n- From context (and matching with sample output format), this answer lists all conflicting rows of this ID with mismatched key value(s).\n\n- For `Sale20240102005`, according to the invoice:  \n  - Original price: 8620.88  \n  - Recorded price: 8369.43  \n  - Original amount: 25862.64  \n  - Recorded amount: 29451.85  \n  - Original date: 2024-01-02  \n  - Recorded date: 2024-01-28  \n  - Original tax: 1293.13  \n  - Recorded tax: 25478.46  \n  - The row has mismatches in these four fields.\n\nIf multiple mismatches are found per problem, list them as separate entries, like the \"Sale20240114023\" example showed in your examples.\n\nSince your new data only presents the above clear duplicate/inconsistent rows for `Initial20231231001`, I have listed those as the core inconsistencies. If you want ALL such incidents (including `Sale20240102005`), let me know, but based strictly on your immediate problem, these are shown above.",
