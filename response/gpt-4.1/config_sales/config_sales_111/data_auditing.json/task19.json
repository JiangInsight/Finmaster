So:\n    - 'Original category': \"Sale\" (from invoice and surrounding Sale rows)\n    - 'Recorded category': \"Purchase\"\n- The `recorded_date` is \"2024-01-21\", invoice date and sequence show it should be \"2024-01-12\" to be consistent like other sales on that date and in order.\n    - 'Original date': \"2024-01-12\"\n    - 'Recorded date': \"2024-01-21\"\n- All other fields are already aligned with the invoice and correct.\n- Thus, only these two fields are internally inconsistent in the row. The other fields are as per the more reliable \"invoice\" wording and numeric data in the row.",
