The payment_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid...\"\n\nHere, the \"invoice\" field clearly states \"this transaction was paid\", but the recorded field shows `\"Unpaid\"` in `recorded_payment/receipt_status`. All other context (date, method, amount, etc.) matches and does not provide further conflict.  \nThus, the invoice, being the more reliable source, shows the transaction was indeed **Paid**.\n\n---\n\nIf you need every inconsistency in the provided table to be listed (there are possibly more, but only one was explicitly flagged in risk_issues and the latest table for input), let me know!",
