The cost is 20000.00 and profit = 39865.25 - 20000.00 = 19865.25.\n\n2. **Tax Amount Inconsistency:**\n    - In this row, `recorded_tax_amount` is 35140.99, while the after-tax amount (`recorded_after_tax_amount`) is 37871.99.\n    - But from the standard calculation and the invoice description: \"cost amount ... $20000.00, with a tax amount of $1993.26, leading to a total amount due of $37871.99.\"\n    - So, the real tax should be 1993.26, but recorded as 35140.99.\n\n3. **Fields Comparison:**\n    - According to the invoice, the original category is \"Sale\" (not \"Purchase\").\n    - The original tax should be 1993.26 (not 35140.99).\n    - Other fields are not explicitly disproven; so set them as null.\n\n4. **JSON Output Format as Requested:**\n    - Fill only the inconsistent fields, put null in others.\n\n*Note:* If other fields (like the amount) disagreed between rows and invoice, we'd include them, but in this case the main issues are with the category/type and tax.\n\nThis matches the requested format and the specific inconsistencies found in the row.",
