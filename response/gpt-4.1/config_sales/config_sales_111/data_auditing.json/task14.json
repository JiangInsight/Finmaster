However, according to the invoice field, only `Cash deposit` 3,000,000.0 and `Bank deposit` 5,000,000.0 have correct mappings. The presence of a `Fixed Assets` row with the amount 5,000,000.0 appears to be an internal errorâ€”most likely, only `Cash deposit` and `Bank deposit` are appropriate for this id and date, and `Fixed Assets` is an incorrect duplicate or misclassification. \n- For `Sale20240106021`, the invoice text states, \"consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $38,390.92, totaling $38,390.92... the receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\" In the table, however, `recorded_quantity` is `0.0` and `recorded_payment/receipt_status` is `Unpaid`, whereas both should be `1.0` and `Paid`.\n\nNote: Some entries above will appear more than once in this output if they suffer from multiple internal mismatches in pairs (as with `Initial20231231001`). This is for precise reporting of which pairs of records are mismatched and what the inferred invoice-correct source was per your requirements. If only the two mismatches are required, reduce to just the two deviations above.",
