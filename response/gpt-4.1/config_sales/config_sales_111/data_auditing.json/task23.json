The receive_method...interest receviable...unpaid.\"\n- In the transaction row for `Interest20240128028`:\n  - | Interest20240128028 | Interest Receivables | 2024-01-28 | 311.73 | ... | On January 28, 2024, an invoice was issued for a Interest Receivables, totaling $311.73. ...\n- The amount in the \"recorded_amount\" field is 311.73, but the \"invoice\" (which is the more reliable field) specifies 435.21. \n- The date is 2024-01-28 in the row, but the invoice text \"On January 28, 2024...\" matches, so date is the same.\n- All other fields (\"category\", payment status, payment method, quantity, price etc) are either not present or match.\n- Therefore, the main inconsistency for this transaction is in the \"amount\":\n    - Original amount: 435.21 (from invoice)\n    - Recorded amount: 311.73 (from row)\n    - id: Interest20240128028\n\nAll other fields are not inconsistent or cannot be established as inconsistent from the given invoice text and row.\n\n**So the output above is correct.**",
