All other fields are either matching or not clearly inconsistent.\n- The best estimate for the correct values is what is stated in the invoice:\n  - Original category/type should be 'Purchase'\n  - Original amount should be 140000.0\n\nNo other fields have a clear, provable discrepancy from invoice relative to the recorded values.",
