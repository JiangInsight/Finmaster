So, profit = 178,308.04 - 100,000.00 = 78,308.04 (before tax), which matches invoice's provided profit calculation rather than the recorded value of 57,513.36.\"\n  }\n]}\n```\n\n**Explanation of approach**:\n\n- For `Initial20231231001`, there are 3 entries (cash deposit, bank deposit, fixed assets) but the amounts do not match. The bank & fixed asset amounts (5,000,000) agree with the invoice; cash deposit says 3,000,000. Per instructions, treat the invoice as more reliable: thus, 3,000,000 entry is incorrect and should be 5,000,000.\n- For `Sale20240112044`, calculating profit from invoice (sale - cost) matches the invoice value (78,308.04), but the recorded field says 57,513.36. This is inconsistent. Thus, original profit should be 78,308.04.\n- Only rows with an internal inconsistency are listed; other rows conform to the invoice or do not contain mismatches.",
