Scan for mismatches between \"recorded_...\" fields and invoice (\"On [date], an invoice was issued for ...\"), preferring invoice narrative as primary record.\n\n2. For `Expense20240109001` (second entry for that id, amount 16166.25, category \"Administrative Expenses\"): The invoice text says \"a Sales Expenses, totaling $16166.25\"—indicating a mis-recording of the expense type (\"Administrative Expenses\" vs \"Sales Expenses\").\n\n3. For `Interest20240125025`: The recorded date is \"2024-02-09\" but the invoice says \"On January 25, 2024, an invoice was issued...\"—thus, the date is incorrect and should match the invoice (2024-01-25). Also, the amount in all other Interest Receivables in this sample is $435.21, but here it's $339.83. The invoice string confirms $339.83, so the amount is correct. The main inconsistency is the date.\n\n**Key fields for each:**\n- category (expense type) mismatch\n- date mismatch\n\nIf you need additional inconsistencies, please specify further.",
