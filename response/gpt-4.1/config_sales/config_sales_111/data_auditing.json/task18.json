The invoice states a cash deposit for $3,000,000, bank deposit for $5,000,000, and fixed assets for $5,000,000, which is an inconsistency since IDs should be unique or represent a summarized transaction. The \"amount\" per invoice doesn't reconcile to a single sum per row with the same ID.\n\n2. **Sale20240127114:**\n   - The recorded quantity is 2, but the invoice and recorded unit price indicate 3 units (3*89491.6 = 268474.80), and the recorded amount (178983.20) does not match the per-invoice total. The recorded profit also does not match the profit implied by the invoice (total - cost). Moreover, payment/receipt status is 'Paid,' but invoice says 'account receviable' (unpaid), another discrepancy.\n\n**If only lines with internal inconsistencies are required, then these are the ones found above in your provided data.
