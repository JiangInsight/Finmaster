This is a classic misclassification.\n- All other fields agree, only the category (\"Financial Expenses\" vs \"Sales Expenses\") is at odds. The invoice, considered more reliable, should be the source of truth. The correct value is \"Sales Expenses\", not \"Financial Expenses\".\n\nNo other internal inconsistencies (such as mismatched quantities, prices, or calculation errors) are present in the given data set. All other entries line up with their invoice descriptions except this category mismatch.",
