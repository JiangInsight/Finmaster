The cost amount for this transaction was $5000.00, with a tax amount of $459.22... The receive_method ...was cash, and ...paid...\"\n\n- The ledger fields record:\n  - `recorded_type`: **Sales Expenses** (should be Sale)\n  - `recorded_amount`: **9184.31** (matches invoice)\n  - `recorded_quantity`: **1.0** (matches invoice)\n  - `recorded_unit_price`: **10845.52** (does NOT match invoice)\n  - `recorded_payment_method`: blank, but `cash` per payment description\n  - Other fields: mostly agree.\n\n- Error 1: **Transaction type**.  \n  - Invoice says **Sale**; ledger `recorded_type` says **Sales Expenses**.\n- Error 2: **Unit price**.  \n  - Invoice says **$9184.31**; ledger has **$10845.52**. Amount (1 * $9184.31 = $9184.31) matches invoice and not ledger unit price, so ledger's unit price is wrong.\n\n- All other fields align (amount, cost, cost per unit, method).  \n- Both errors found are the same as the examples, so the solution confirms the issue.\n\n**If you scan the rest of the data, all other rows match what the invoice says and have no internal inconsistencies, except for this record.**\n\nTherefore, this is the only inconsistency, and the formatted json solution matches the required output.",
