There can only be one initial transaction for the same id and date. Given the standard accounting treatment, likely the correct value is: Cash deposit + Bank deposit = Fixed Assets, i.e., (3000000.0 + 5000000.0) = 8000000.0. However, the invoice lines indicate each type separately. The inconsistency is multiple recorded types and amounts under a single id.\",\n        \"Original Approver\": \"\",\n        \"Recorded Approver\": \"\",\n        \"Other fields\": \"n/a: root cause is duplicate use of the id with conflicting type and amount\"\n    }\n]}\n```\nExplanation of solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Problem Identification**:\n   - The id `Initial20231231001` appears 3 times for the same date (2023-12-31), but with three different categories/types (`Cash deposit`, `Bank deposit`, `Fixed Assets`) and three different amounts (3,000,000; 5,000,000; 5,000,000). \n   - According to standard practice, the 'invoice' description is usually the most reliable and multiple entries with the same 'id' and date should not have different categories/types or amounts.\n\n2. **Type and Amount Inconsistency**:\n   - Each row claims a different 'recorded_type' and 'recorded_amount' for the same id (`Initial20231231001`).\n   - This is internal inconsistencyâ€”the same id should not represent three distinct transactions.\n\n3. **Estimate of Correct Value**:\n   - In a standard initial capital entry, the sum of asset entries (cash + bank deposit) should match the fixed assets if they are linked, or there should be unique ids for each asset type.\n   - Since 'invoice' lists each separately, the error is the repeated use of the same id for different asset types/amounts.\n\n4. **Fields Affected**:\n   - 'recorded_type'/category, 'recorded_amount', possibly others (fields for each asset individually should be split out with unique ids).\n\n5. **Solution Output**:\n   - One grouped entry, explicitly calling out the repeated id with conflicting type and amount, and reasoning the likely correct accounting structure.\n```",
