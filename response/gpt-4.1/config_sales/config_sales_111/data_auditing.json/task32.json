The cost amount for this transaction was $60,000.00, with a tax amount of $5,513.59, leading to a total amount due of $104,758.25. The receive_method of this transaction was cash, and this transaction was paid.\n\nBut the recorded row is:\n\n| id | recorded_type | recorded_date | recorded_amount | ... | recorded_quantity | recorded_unit_price | ... | \n|----|--------------|---------------|----------------|-----|-------------------|---------------------|-----| \n| Sale20240114051 | Sale | 2024-01-16 | 73514.56 | ... | 2.0 | 41733.96 | ... | \n\n- The recorded **date** is \"2024-01-16\", but the invoice (more reliable) is \"2024-01-14\".\n- The **quantity** recorded is 2.0, but the invoice says 3.0 units.\n- The **unit price** recorded is $41,733.96, but the invoice says $36,757.28.\n- The **amount** recorded is $73,514.56, but the invoice says $110,271.84.\n- The **tax** recorded matches the invoice, so it is correct.\n- The payment/receipt status, receive method, and category all match and are correct.\n- The profit row and some others could be blank/missing in the record (not material/inconsistent), so left blank unless specifically mentioned.\n\nThus, multiple fields in the row are inconsistent with the formal invoice. Above, the solution lists all detected discrepancies.",
