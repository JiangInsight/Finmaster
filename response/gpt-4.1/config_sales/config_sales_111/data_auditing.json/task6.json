The invoice says \"2.0 units at a unit price of $93317.37, totaling $186634.74\". However, the recorded_unit_price is 109001.61, which does NOT match the invoice or the calculation (2.0 x 93317.37 = 186634.74).\n- The correct unit price per the invoice is 93317.37, not 109001.61.\n- All other fields match the invoice. No other inconsistencies visible in this row.\n- Therefore, only recorded_unit_price is at issue. Everything else is either correct or not relevant for this error.\n\n**Summary**: The only inconsistency is the recorded unit price for id Sale20240120080 should be 93317.37 per invoice, but is incorrectly recorded as 109001.61.",
