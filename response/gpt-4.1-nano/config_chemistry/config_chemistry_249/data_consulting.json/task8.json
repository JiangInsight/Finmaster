However, “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities” is provided as -6,856,840.58, which likely also represents the operating cash flow.\n\n**Note:** In the example, the ratio uses \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities,\" but in the data, this field isn't directly filled. The \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" probably corresponds to the same.\n\nAnd the Net Income is given as -2,035,736.52.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the ratio**\n\nThe ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Net Income\n\n- Operating Cash Flow = -6,856,840.58\n- Net Income = -2,035,736.52\n\nNow, compute:\n\nRatio = (-6,856,840.58) / (-2,035,736.52) ≈ 3.37\n\nExpressed as a percentage: 3.37 * 100 ≈ 337%\n\n**Step 4: Round appropriately**\n\nThe example shows 4.41, suggesting typical rounding to two decimal places.\n\nThus, the ratio ≈ **3.37**\n\n---\n\n**Final answer in required format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '3.37'} }\n```",
