                        "content": "Let's break down the steps to calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the net cash flow from operating activities for the period.\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = **-6,856,840.58**\n\n### Step 2: Estimate the total debt for the period.\nTotal debt is typically represented by total liabilities, which include current liabilities and possibly long-term liabilities. In this case, no long-term liabilities are specified; hence, we will consider total liabilities as current liabilities since they are explicitly given.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = **1,601,835.08**\n\nSince no other liabilities are provided, we will use this as the total debt measure.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio.\nFormula:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[\n= \\frac{-6,856,840.58}{1,601,835.08} \\approx -4.28\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Round to two decimal places if needed.\nResult: **-4.28**\n\n### Final answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-4.28'} }\n```\nThis indicates that the company's operating cash flow is significantly negative relative to its current liabilities, implying it is not in a position to comfortably cover its short-term obligations based on cash flow.",
