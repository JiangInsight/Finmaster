Since the problem emphasizes liabilities, using total liabilities makes sense. \n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total current liabilities = 1,601,835.08\n- The main non-current liabilities are not explicitly listed, but total liabilities include all liabilities:\n  \nTotal liabilities can be extrapolated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Liabilities} = \\text{Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity} - \\text{Owner's Equity}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity (End amount) = 12,566,098.56\n- Total Owner's Equity (End amount) = 10,964,263.48\n\nCalculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Liabilities} = 12,566,098.56 - 10,964,263.48 = 1,601,835.08\n\\]\n\n(Note: the liabilities sum matches the total current liabilities, suggesting no additional long-term liabilities are listed)\n\nNow, from the cash flow statement:\n- Net cash flow from operating activities = -6,856,840.58\n- The cash flow measures what is available to pay debt, but for the ratio, we need net debt.\n\nCalculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents (Ending Balance)} = 477,081.24\n\\]\n\nAssuming the debt is approximated by total liabilities (since no long-term debt is specified), the ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nCompute:\n\\[\n\\frac{-6,856,840.58}{1,601,835.08} \\approx -4.28\n\\]\n\nExpressed as a ratio:\n\\[\n-4.28\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Gross Profit Margin\": \"16.62%\", \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-4.28\"}}\n```",
