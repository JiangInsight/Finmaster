Given that in the previous example, the ratio was less than 1, and considering the actual data, this one is close to 0.98, which can be approximated to \"0.98\".\n\n**Final answers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-7522918.76\",\n    \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.98\"\n  }\n}\n```",
