                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided data step by step to calculate the required financial ratios.\n\n**1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio**  \n- Formula: Operating Cash Flow / Total Current Liabilities  \n- From cash flow statement: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,856,840.58  \n- Total Current Liabilities at end date: 1,601,835.08  \n\nCalculation:  \n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -6,856,840.58 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ -4.28\n\n**2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**  \n- Assumption: Total debt = Total Current Liabilities + Long-term liabilities (not explicitly provided, but for comparison purposes, we'll use current liabilities)  \n- Since no long-term debt details are given, we'll approximate using current liabilities.  \n- Total debt ≈ 1,601,835.08  \n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -6,856,840.58  \n\nCalculation:  \n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -6,856,840.58 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ -4.28\n\n**3. Inventory Turnover Ratio**  \n- Formula: Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  \n- COGS = 5,700,000.00  \n- Average Inventory = (Beginning + Ending Inventory) / 2 = (0 + 3,420,000) / 2 = 1,710,000  \n(Note: beginning inventory is zero; this suggests purchases or inventory buildup after initial period)\n\nCalculation:  \n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = 5,700,000 / 1,710,000 ≈ 3.33\n\n**4. Debt to Equity Ratio**  \n- Formula: Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity  \n- Total Debt: Approximate with current liabilities = 1,601,835.08  \n- Equity = Total Owner's Equity = 10,964,263.48  \n\nCalculation:  \n- Debt to Equity Ratio = 1,601,835.08 / 10,964,263.48 ≈ 0.15\n\n**5. Quick Ratio**  \n- Formula: (Cash + Accounts Receivable + Short-term Investments) / Current Liabilities  \n- Cash + Accounts Receivable = 376,598.62 + 3,098,023.69 = 3,474,622.31  \n- Short-term investments (Bank Deposits): 100,482.62  \n- Sum: 3,474,622.31 + 100,482.62 = 3,575,104.93  \n- Current Liabilities: 1,601,835.08  \n\nCalculation:  \n- Quick Ratio = 3,575,104.93 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ 2.23\n\n**6. Current Ratio**  \n- Formula: Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \n- Total Current Assets = 7,000,260.27  \n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08  \n\nCalculation:  \n- Current Ratio = 7,000,260.27 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ 4.37\n\n---\n\n### Final formatted answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-4.28\",\n               \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-4.28\",\n               \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"3.33\",\n               \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.15\",\n               \"Quick Ratio\": \"2.23\",\n               \"Current Ratio\": \"4.37\"}}\n```",
