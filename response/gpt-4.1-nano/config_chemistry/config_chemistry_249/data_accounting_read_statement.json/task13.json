The task is to identify specific line items in the balance sheet that are *not expected to be realised or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle*. These typically include assets like fixed assets, which are held for use rather than sale.\n\n2. From the provided data, the relevant line items are:\n   - Fixed Assets\n   - Accumulated Depreciation (since it relates to Fixed Assets)\n   \n3. The total value of \"Fixed Assets\" at the initial date is 5,000,000.00 and at the end date it is 5,666,078.18.\n\n4. The accumulated depreciation (initially 0.00, then 100,239.89) is associated with the fixed assets; however, it reduces the net value of fixed assets. Since we are asked for assets not intended for sale or consumption, the net book value of fixed assets typically includes depreciation but excludes accumulated depreciation as a separate asset.\n\n5. The line item of interest here is \"Fixed Assets\" because these are long-term assets for use, not intended for sale: \n   - Initial value: 5,000,000.00\n   - End value: 5,666,078.18\n\n6. The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is a contra asset reducing fixed assetsâ€™ value, but not an asset held for sale.\n\nTherefore, the relevant line item that is not expected to be realised or intended for sale in the normal course of operations is **Fixed Assets**.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5666078.18'} }\n```",
