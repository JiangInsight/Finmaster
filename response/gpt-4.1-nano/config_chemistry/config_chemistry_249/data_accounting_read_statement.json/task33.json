We need to identify two specific line items:\n   - Income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities.\n   - Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\n2. Typically, in an income statement:\n   - Income from core operating activities is represented by \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue.\"\n   - The carrying amount of inventories sold corresponds to \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\n3. In this data:\n   - \"Main Business Revenue\" indicates income from core operations.\n   - \"Cost of Goods Sold\" indicates the carrying amount of inventories sold.\n\n4. Both of these line items are directly related to core operational activities, so they should be selected accordingly.\n\nNow, extracting the relevant values:\n\n- \"Main Business Revenue\" = 6,836,701.10\n- \"Cost of Goods Sold\" = 5,700,000.00\n\nFinally, present the output in the specified JSON format.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '6836701.10', 'value2': '5700000.00'}}\n```",
