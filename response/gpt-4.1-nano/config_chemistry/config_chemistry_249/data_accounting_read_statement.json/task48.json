The task asks for the two specific line items:\n   - The amount of profit retained after all expenses (which corresponds to Net Profit).\n   - The cash payments for property, plant, and equipment (which is related to purchases of fixed assets).\n\n2. According to the account titles:\n   - \"Net Profit\" is straightforward.\n   - \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" indicates cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment.\n\n3. Extracting these values from the provided data:\n\n   - Net Profit (the amount retained after expenses): **-2035736.52**\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets (cash payments for long-term assets): **666078.18**\n\n4. Maintaining the order as per the input statement (Net Profit first, then Purchase of Fixed Assets).\n\nNow, formatting these findings into the requested JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"-2035736.52\", \"value2\": \"666078.18\"}}\n```\n\nThis completes the solution.",
