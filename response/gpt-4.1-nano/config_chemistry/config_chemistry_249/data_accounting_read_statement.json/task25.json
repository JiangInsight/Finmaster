                        "content": "To identify and extract the costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers, we need to look for specific line items in the income statement that relate to sales and delivery costs.\n\nTypically, these costs are found under categories such as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" or \"Selling Expenses.\" \n\nIn this case:\n- \"Cost of Goods Sold\" directly represents the cost of producing or acquiring the goods that were sold, which relates to delivering the goods to customers.\n- \"Selling Expenses\" can include costs associated with securing orders (such as sales commissions, promotional expenses) and delivering goods (such as shipping costs).\n\nGiven the task, the relevant costs are:\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 5,700,000.00\n- Selling Expenses: 477,715.85\n\nSince the task asks for \"costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services,\" the most specific line item is \"Selling Expenses.\" However, \"Cost of Goods Sold\" also directly relates to the delivery of goods. \n\nTherefore, for completeness, I will include both line items.\n\nThe combined amount for these costs is:\n- 5,700,000.00 + 477,715.85 = 6,177,715.85\n\nBut if we are to provide specific line items and their values individually, the two are:\n\n1. Cost of Goods Sold: 5,700,000.00\n2. Selling Expenses: 477,715.85\n\nThe problem may expect just a single value, or possibly the key line items separately. Based on the examples and the wording \"identify and extract the specific line items and value,\" I'll pick \"Selling Expenses\" as the primary cost associated with securing orders and delivering services, since it explicitly encompasses these activities.\n\nAnswer:\n{\"solution\": {'value': '477715.85'}}\n\nNote: If a more comprehensive answer is needed, including both items, the combined amount should be provided. But following the pattern from examples, I choose the most relevant line item.\n\nFinal answer in the required format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"477715.85\"}}\n```",
