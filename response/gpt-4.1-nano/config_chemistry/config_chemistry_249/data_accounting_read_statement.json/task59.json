The end value of amounts of interest accrued but not yet received.\n2. The net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n### 1. Extracting interest accrued but not yet received:\n\n- Interest accrued but not yet received is typically represented by accounts named \"Interest Receivable.\"\n- From the balance sheet sections:\n  - First problem: Interest Receivable end amount = 5155.34\n  - Second problem: Interest Receivable end amount = 5155.34\n\n- From the income statement, \"Interest Income\" is recognized as 2672.87 (first problem), and 5155.34 (second problem). But we need the balance of \"Interest Receivable,\" which is explicitly shown in the balance sheet.\n\n### 2. Extracting the net addition in cash and cash equivalents:\n\n- The net increase/decrease in cash is usually given directly as the \"Net Increase\" or can be inferred from beginning and ending balances.\n- From the cash flow sections:\n  - First problem: Net increase = -7565348.53\n  - Second problem: Net increase = -7522918.76\n\n### Final step:\n\n- For each problem, pick the end balance of \"Interest Receivable.\"\n- For the net increase/decrease in cash, pick the \"Net Increase\" value from the cash flow statements because they directly represent the net change in cash during the period.\n\n### Results:\n\n- For the first problem:\n  - Interest accrued but not yet received = 5155.34\n  - Net addition/decrease in cash = -7565348.53\n\n- For the second problem:\n  - Interest accrued but not yet received = 5155.34\n  - Net addition/decrease in cash = -7522918.76\n\n### Final answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"5155.34\", \"value2\": \"-7565348.53\"}}\n```",
