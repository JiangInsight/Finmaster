Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers:\n   - These are generally reflected as selling expenses or administrative expenses in the income statement.\n   - Looking at the typical classification, \"Selling Expenses\" often relate to costs of securing customer orders, marketing, sales commissions, etc.\n   - \"Administrative Expenses\" relate more to general administrative costs.\n   - From the provided income statement, \"Selling Expenses\" is 477715.85, which aligns with costs of securing orders and delivering services.\n   - The other relevant line is \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (5700000.00), which is associated with delivering the goods/services (production costs). However, the task specifically asks for costs to secure orders and to deliver the goods/services, which collectively are usually \"Selling Expenses\" plus \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n   - But based on the initial instructions and typical accounting, \"costs to secure customer orders\" are part of \"Selling Expenses,\" and \"to deliver the goods/services\" are part of \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n   \n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets:\n   - These are reflected in the cash flow statement under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n   - From the cash flow statement, the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" value is 666078.18.\n\nSince the instructions ask for **two items** and provide an example that shows the \"costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services\" combined as a single item, the most precise line item combining these two is the sum of \"Selling Expenses\" and \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 5700000.00\n- Selling Expenses = 477715.85\n\nSum = 5700000.00 + 477715.85 = 6177715.85\n\nFor the second item:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets = 666078.18\n\nNow, the \"solution\" format in the example shows the output as string representations of the values, so we will format accordingly:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '6177715.85', 'value2': '666078.18'} }\n```\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '6177715.85', 'value2': '666078.18'} }\n```",
