These typically include current liabilities such as accounts payable and taxes payable, as they are generally settled within one year or the operating cycle.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n- Accounts Payable\n- Taxes Payable\n\nInitial amounts:\n- Accounts Payable: 0.00\n- Taxes Payable: 0.00\n\nFinal amounts:\n- Accounts Payable: 1,260,000.00\n- Taxes Payable: 341,835.08\n\nNow, sum the final liabilities to get the total liabilities expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle:\nTotal = 1,260,000.00 + 341,835.08 = 1,601,835.08\n\nThe initial total liabilities for these items are zero; the initial value was zero, and the final value reflects the expected settlement in the operating cycle.\n\nHence, the answer is:\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1601835.08'}}",
