This matches the description as \"reduction in assets...\" |\n| Cash flow from activities related to purchase/disposal of long-term assets and interest/dividends | -666078.18 | Cash flows from investing activities include \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = 666,078.18 (investment outflow). |\n| Net increase in cash and cash equivalents | -7522918.76 | Directly given as \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents entry for the period. |\n\n**Note:** The inventory decrease is -3,420,000, which matches the description of reduction in assets held for sale or in production.\n\n### Final step: Assemble the answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value1\": \"100239.89\",\n    \"value2\": \"-3420000.00\",\n    \"value3\": \"-666078.18\",\n    \"value4\": \"-7522918.76\"\n  }\n}\n```",
