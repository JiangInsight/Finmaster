Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the principal revenue-producing activities (Operating Cash Flow):**  \nFrom cash flow statement, this is typically the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities.  \nHere, it is **-6856840.58** (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities).  \n\n**b. The amounts of taxes accrued but not yet paid:**  \nThis corresponds to the \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" in the cash flow statement.  \nHere, it is **341835.08**.  \n\n**c. Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities (Net Profit):**  \nFrom the income statement, this is \"Net Profit.\"  \nHere, it is **-2035736.52**.  \n\n### 2. Confirm the grouping and order:\n\n- Balance Sheet:  \n  The group includes relevant assets, liabilities, and equity. The line items are as provided, but per instruction, only the three specific items are required.\n\n- Income Statement:  \n  \"Net Profit\" is directly available.\n\n- Cash Flow Statement:  \n  \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" captures the principal cash generated.\n\n### 3. Prepare the output:\n\nBased on the analysis:\n- **Value 1:** `341835.08` (Taxes payable accrued but not yet paid)\n- **Value 2:** `-6856840.58` (Net cash generated from operating activities)\n- **Value 3:** `-2035736.52` (Total income from ordinary activities)\n\n### Final Output:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '341835.08', 'value2': '-6856840.58', 'value3': '-2035736.52'}}\n```",
