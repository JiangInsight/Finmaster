Typically, these are labeled as \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue\" in the income statement.\n\nIn this case, the relevant line item is \"Main Business Revenue,\" which directly indicates the core operating income.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Check the \"Account\" column for revenue-related line items.\n2. Identify the line item that reflects income from core operations, usually \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n3. Extract the associated amount, which is 6,836,701.10.\n\nThus, the core operating income (or revenue) for this period is 6,836,701.10.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '6836701.10'} }\n```",
