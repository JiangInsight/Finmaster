The task is to identify the line item that represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, from the financial statement.\n\n2. Looking at the balance sheet, the key inventory-related line is \"Inventory,\" which shows the starting and ending amounts.\n\n3. The income statement provides the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS), which is the value of inventory sold during the period.\n\n4. Typically, the \"Carrying amount of inventories sold\" is represented by the COGS, as it reflects the cost associated with the inventory items sold during the period.\n\n5. In the second dataset, the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is 5,700,000.00.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item for the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is the \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" which is 5,700,000.00.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5700000.00'} }\n```",
