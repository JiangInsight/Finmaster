Expenses are typically found under categories such as \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" \"Selling Expenses,\" \"Administrative Expenses,\" \"Interest Expenses,\" etc. \n\nIn the provided data, the only relevant line item related to expenses appears to be \"Retained Earnings,\" which shows a negative change, indicating an expense or loss.\n\nLet's analyze the changes:\n\n- Initial Retained Earnings: 0.00\n- Final Retained Earnings: -2,035,736.52\n\nSince Retained Earnings decreased by 2,035,736.52, it suggests that expenses (or losses) totaling this amount were incurred during this period. \n\nIn the absence of more detailed profit or loss statement line items, the most reasonable extraction is the change in Retained Earnings as a proxy for expenses.\n\nNow, I will formalize the answer.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"-2035736.52\"}}\n```",
