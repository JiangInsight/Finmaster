Typically, such assets are classified separately if they are intended for sale and meet the criteria of being held for sale, including assets in the process of being disposed of or prepared for sale.\n\nIn the provided data, the relevant line items that reflect assets \"held for sale\" would include inventory and any assets under production or in the process of being manufactured that are specifically designated for sale.\n\nLooking at the values:\n\n- Inventory (end value): 3,420,000.00\n- Fixed Assets (end value): 5,666,078.18\n- Accumulated Depreciation (end value): 100,239.89 (related to fixed assets)\n- Total Non-current Assets (end value): 5,565,838.29\n\nIn this context, \"assets held for sale\" likely includes inventory and possibly fixed assets that are being prepared for sale. Since inventory directly represents assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, that line item is most clearly associated.\n\nThe fixed assets could also potentially be part of assets held for sale if they are classified as such, especially if in the process of being disposed of or prepared for sale.\n\nGiven the data, the most straightforward and recognizable asset held for sale is inventory, with a clear \"initial\" and \"final\" value.\n\nTherefore, the values to highlight are:\n\n- Initial value (at 2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End value (at 2024-02-01): 3,420,000.00\n\nThis indicates an increase in assets held for sale, matching the inventory increase.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3420000.00'}}\n```",
