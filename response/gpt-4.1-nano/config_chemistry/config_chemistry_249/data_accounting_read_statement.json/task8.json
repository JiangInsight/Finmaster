This corresponds to accounts such as \"Accounts Payable\" or other payable liabilities. \n\nStep 1: Review all line items for liabilities related to credit purchases.\nStep 2: The relevant account here appears to be \"Accounts Payable,\" since it represents amounts payable for goods/services purchased on credit.\nStep 3: Extract the initial and end values of \"Accounts Payable\" from the table.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Initial amount of Accounts Payable: 0.00 (on 2023-12-31)\n- End amount of Accounts Payable: 1,260,000.00 (on 2024-02-01)\n\nTherefore, the specific line items are \"Accounts Payable\" with the initial and final values as above.\n\nAnswer in the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1260000.00'} }\n```",
