Note the initial and end balances for Accounts Payable:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - End_amount: 1,260,000.00\n\n2. The increase in Accounts Payable during the period:\n   - 1,260,000.00 - 0.00 = 1,260,000.00\n\n3. This increase signifies the amount of goods or services received or purchased on credit that were not yet paid for by the period's end.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and value of the addition in the amount owed (accounts payable) during the period is 1,260,000.00.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1260000.00'} }\n```",
