For tangible items for operational use, \"Inventory\" and possibly \"Fixed Assets\" qualify.\n\n3. **Amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid:**\n   - This is represented by \"Taxes Payable\" (initial and end amounts).\n\nNow, selecting the three specific line items that meet the criteria:\n\n- **Cash items**: \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\"\n- **Tax accrued but not yet paid**: \"Taxes Payable\"\n\nGiven the instructions to maintain the order from the input statement for multiple outputs, the sequence is:\n\n1. **Cash on Hand** (Initial and End)\n2. **Bank Deposits** (Initial and End)\n3. **Taxes Payable** (Initial and End)\n\n---\n\n### Final extracted values:\n\n- \"Cash on Hand\"\n  - Initial: 3000000.00\n  - End: 376598.62\n- \"Bank Deposits\"\n  - Initial: 5000000.00\n  - End: 100482.62\n- \"Taxes Payable\"\n  - Initial: 0.00\n  - End: 341835.08\n\n---\n\n### JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '3000000.00', 'end valu1': '376598.62', 'initial value2': '5000000.00', 'end valu2': '100482.62', 'initial value3': '0.00', 'end valu3': '341835.08'}}\n```",
