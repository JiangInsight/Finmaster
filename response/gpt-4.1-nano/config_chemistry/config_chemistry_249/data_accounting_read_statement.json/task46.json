Here, only a purchase is reported, indicating a negative inflow.\n\n**Decomposition:**\n\n- The purchase of fixed assets already appears as a sub-item.  \n \nSince the only relevant signifying sub-item listed under investing activities related to acquisition (purchase of fixed assets), and there's no sale or disposal item explicitly listed, the sub-item for this component is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Final step:\n\n- The net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated (or used) in the acquisition/disposal of long-term assets, excluding cash equivalents, is represented by the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n\n- Final value: **-666,078.18**\n\n- Sub-item: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" value is **666,078.18**\n\n### Final answer in required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-666078.18\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"666078.18\"}}\n```",
