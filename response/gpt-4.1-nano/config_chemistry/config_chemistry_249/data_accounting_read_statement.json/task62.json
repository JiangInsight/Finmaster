Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit**  \n- This corresponds to Accounts Receivable, which is a current asset indicating amounts owed by customers.  \n- From the balance sheet, at the end date, Accounts Receivable = 3,098,023.69.\n\n**2. Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**  \n- This typically refers to interest expenses or financing expenses.  \n- Looking at the income statement, \"Financial Expenses\" are listed as 657,075.51 at the end date.  \n- Alternatively, in many contexts, interest expenses are explicitly listed; here, \"Financial Expenses\" is the most representative.\n\n**3. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets**  \n- This is represented in cash flow from investing activities, specifically \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"  \n- From the cash flow statement, \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = 666,078.18 at the end date.\n\n---\n\n### Final extracted values:\n- Line item for amounts owed for goods/services sold (Accounts Receivable): 3,098,023.69\n- Line item for financing costs (Financial Expenses): 657,075.51\n- Line item for cash payments for capital assets (Purchase of Fixed Assets): 666,078.18\n\n---\n\n### Final answer in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"3098023.69\", \"value2\": \"657075.51\", \"value3\": \"666078.18\"}}\n```",
