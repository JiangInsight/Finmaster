                        "content": "Let's analyze the data step by step:\n\n1. Identify initial paid-in capital:\n   - The initial capital is usually reflected as the first recorded capital input in the ledger.\n   - In this data, the earliest capital contributions are:\n     - \"Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit\" of 3,000,000\n     - \"Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit\" of 5,000,000\n     - \"Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets\" of 5,000,000\n   - However, the relevant initial paid-in capital (investment) typically includes cash contributions and other equity contributions, but fixed assets are usually capitalized as assets and are not part of \"paid-in capital\" per se.\n   - Since the main initial contribution is in cash (cash deposit and bank deposit), the total initial paid-in capital is:\n     - 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000\n\n2. Identify any additional contributions:\n   - The only significant inflow explicitly labeled as initial capital is the sum above.\n   - No other mentions indicate additional contributions or reductions that would affect paid-in capital directly.\n\n3. Determine final paid-in capital:\n   - Since the problem asks for both initial and final amounts, and typical accounting treatment considers the initial paid-in capital as the initial total contributions, and the final amount as the cumulative contributions after all activities.\n   - The data shows no further equity injections or distributions affecting paid-in capital.\n   - Therefore, unless there are withdrawals or reclassifications, the total paid-in capital remains the same.\n\n4. Final paid-in capital amount:\n   - Still 8,000,000.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Initial paid-in capital = 8,000,000\n- Final paid-in capital = 8,000,000\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
