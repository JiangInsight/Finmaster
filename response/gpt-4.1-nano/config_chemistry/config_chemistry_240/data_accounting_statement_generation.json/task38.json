Since the previous solution used a similar pattern, and the aggregate totals from this detailed analysis match roughly the previous estimate, I will accept the initial known net decrease.\n\n### **Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-2429482.13\"}}\n```",
