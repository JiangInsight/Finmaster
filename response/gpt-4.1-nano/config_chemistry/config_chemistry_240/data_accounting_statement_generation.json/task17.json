This suggests that accumulated losses or payouts exceeded the net income, or the initial retained earnings were negative.\n\nSince the explicit data shows a computed ending retained earnings of approximately -1,645,141.43, it indicates accumulated losses over the period.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**Initial Retained earnings** are logically 0 (start of period), and **ending retained earnings** are approximately **-1,645,141.43** as per the provided solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Retained Earnings Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Retained Earnings End Value\": \"-1645141.43\"}}\n```",
