                        "content": "To find the interest accrued but not yet received, we need to identify the relevant line item from the financial statements, focusing on the \"Interest Receivable\" account, which records interest that has been earned but not yet received.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Look at the balance sheet for the initial and final values of \"Interest Receivable\":\n   - Initial amount: 0.00\n   - End amount: 4535.06\n\n2. The initial value at the start of the period is zero, indicating no interest accrued or receivable at that point.\n\n3. The final value of 4535.06 shows the accrued interest that has not yet been received as of the end date.\n\n4. The change in \"Interest Receivable\" corresponds to the interest accrued during the period that remains receivable at the period's end.\n\nHence, the line items of interest accrued but not yet received are:\n\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- Final value: 4535.06\n\nFinal answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"4535.06\"}}\n```",
