Common line items that are relevant include:\n\n- Assets \"held for sale\" (if explicitly listed)\n- Assets \"in production for such sale\" or \"in the process of being manufactured\" (often part of inventory or specific manufacturing/production assets)\n\nIn the provided data, the most relevant line item appears to be \"Inventory,\" which is often associated with assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business or in production for such sale.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Initial inventory value: 0.00\n2. Final inventory value: 4,530,000.00 (End_amount on 2024-01-28)\n3. Inventory is a typical line item representing assets in the process of being manufactured or held for sale.\n4. No other line items explicitly mention assets held for sale; hence, inventory is the primary indicator.\n\nTherefore, the initial and final values of assets held for sale (inventory) are:\n\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- Final value: 4,530,000.00\n\nAnswer in the JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '4530000.00'} }\n```",
