End value of profit or loss before deducting tax expense**  \n- From the income statement, this is \"Profit Before Tax,\" which is (−923950.35).\n\n**b. The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**  \n- This refers to \"accounts payable\" or the change in \"Accounts Payable.\"\n- Initial accounts payable (2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End accounts payable (2024-01-28): 3,010,000.00\n- Increase (or addition): 3,010,000.00\n\n**c. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**  \n- From the balance sheet, \"Paid-in Capital\" is typically the capital contributed by shareholders.\n- End value (2024-01-28): 13,000,000.00\n\n### Step 2: Confirm the order and format\nOrder:\n1. Balance Sheet: capital contributed by shareholders → \"Paid-in Capital\"\n2. Income Statement: profit/loss before tax → \"Profit Before Tax\"\n3. Cash Flow Statement: addition to owed amount, i.e., change in Accounts Payable.\n\n### Final Answers:\n- value1 (capital contributed): 13,000,000.00\n- value2 (profit before tax): -923,950.35\n- value3 (increase in accounts payable): 3,010,000.00\n\n### Presenting the result in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '-923950.35', 'value3': '3010000.00'} }\n```\n\nThis matches the required format and correctly identifies the specified line items and end values.",
