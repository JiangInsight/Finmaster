Since the inventory started at zero at the beginning of the period and ended at 4,530,000.00, and the COGS is 6,720,000.00, the inventory sold should be the COGS, assuming no inventory was purchased or disposed of outside the regular business operations.\n\nThus, the line item and the value of inventories sold during the period are directly represented by the COGS, which equals 6,720,000.00.\n\nAnswer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"6720000.00\"}}\n```",
