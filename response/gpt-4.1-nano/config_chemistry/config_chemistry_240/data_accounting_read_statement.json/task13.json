The total assets include current assets and non-current assets.\n2. Current assets are expected to be realized or consumed within the operating cycle.\n3. Non-current assets, such as fixed assets, are generally not expected to be realized or sold within the normal operating cycle unless indicated otherwise.\n4. From the data, the relevant line item of non-current assets is \"Fixed Assets,\" which initially is 5,000,000.00 and ends at 6,593,203.67.\n5. This increase indicates changes in fixed assets over the period, but they are assets held for ongoing use, not for sale.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item is \"Fixed Assets,\" with initial and final values as specified.\n\nSolution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '6593203.67'}}\n```",
