Identify current liabilities from the given data:\n   - Accounts Payable: 3,010,000.00\n   - Taxes Payable: 418,090.41\n2. Sum these current liabilities:\n   - Total Current Liabilities = 3,028,090.41\n3. Initial total of current liabilities was 0.00, with the end value being 3,428,090.41, indicating the liabilities that are expected to be settled during the period.\n\nAnswer:\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"3428090.41\"}}",
