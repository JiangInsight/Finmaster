The amount of profit retained after all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, have been deducted from total revenue.  \n2. The cash payments made to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Net Profit**  \nFrom the table, the \"Net Profit\" is given:  \n**-1342040.76**\n\n**Step 2: Find Depreciation (and amortization if any)**  \nDepreciation is provided:  \n**45751.04**\n\n**Step 3: Identify cash payments for property, plant, and equipment**  \nThe investments in fixed assets are listed as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\":  \n**1593203.67**\n\n---\n\n**Note**:  \n- The \"retained profit\" after all expenses is typically reflected as Net Profit (or net income).  \n- The amount of cash paid to acquire property, plant, and equipment (capital expenditures) is directly given as the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nNow, ensure the order matches the original task statement:\n\n- First item: the amount of profit retained after all expenses (Net Profit).  \n- Second item: cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment (Purchase of Fixed Assets).\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer in the required format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '-1342040.76', 'value2': '1593203.67'}}\n```",
