                        "content": "To determine the costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services, we need to identify the relevant line items in the income statement that relate to these activities.\n\nTypically, expenses directly associated with acquiring customer orders (selling and marketing costs) and delivering goods/services (cost of goods sold) are considered.\n\n1. **Costs to secure customer orders**: Usually include selling expenses.\n2. **Costs to deliver goods/services**: Usually include the cost of goods sold.\n\nExamining the provided statement:\n\n- **Selling Expenses**: 404114.07\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: 6720000.00\n\nThus, the costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods/services are the sum of these two line items.\n\nCalculations:\n- Sum = Selling Expenses + Cost of Goods Sold\n- Sum = 404114.07 + 6720000.00\n- Sum = 7124114.07\n\nHowever, depending on the definition, sometimes only specific costs are considered. But generally, on an income statement, these two line items correspond directly to the costs related to securing orders and delivering services.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"404114.07\"}}\n```\n*(If focusing only on 'costs to secure customer orders' alone)*\n\nor\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"7124114.07\"}}\n```\n*(If referring to both combined costs for securing and delivery)*\n\nGiven the instruction, it's most appropriate to include both items, as both are costs related to delivering goods and securing customer orders.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"7124114.07\"}}\n```",
