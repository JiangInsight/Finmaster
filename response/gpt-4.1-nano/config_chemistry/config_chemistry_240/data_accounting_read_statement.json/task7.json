The requirement is to identify expense line items from the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, including their initial and ending values.\n\n2. In typical financial statements, expenses are usually reflected in various accounts, such as \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" \"Operating Expenses,\" \"Interest Expense,\" \"Depreciation Expense,\" etc.\n\n3. In the provided table, the relevant accounts that represent expenses or expenses-related items are:\n   - **Accumulated Depreciation** (related to depreciation expense)\n   - **Retained Earnings** (affected by net income, which is revenue minus expenses)\n\n4. Since the problem context involves balance sheet data with initial and final values, the \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is especially relevant because the change in this account reflects depreciation expense during the period.\n\n5. The initial value of **Accumulated Depreciation** was 0.00, and the final value is 45,751.04.\n\n6. The change (increase) in accumulated depreciation over the period typically represents the depreciation expense incurred during that period.\n\n**Therefore:**\n\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- Final value: 45,751.04\n\nThis aligns with how depreciation expense accumulates over time.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '45751.04'}}\n```",
