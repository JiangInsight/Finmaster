                        "content": "To identify the amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit, we need to look at liabilities related to accounts payable or similar accounts that represent credit obligations.\n\nStep 1: Focus on accounts under liabilities that typically indicate amounts owed for goods or services received on credit, such as \"Accounts Payable.\"\n\nStep 2: From the data, note the initial and end values of \"Accounts Payable.\"\n\n- Initial_amount (2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End_amount (2024-01-28): 3,010,000.00\n\nStep 3: The change in \"Accounts Payable\" indicates the new credit obligations incurred or paid over the period. Since the initial was zero, and the end value is positive, it suggests new credit amounts owed.\n\nFinal step: Present the initial and final values of \"Accounts Payable\" as the amounts owed.\n\nAnswer:\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3010000.00'} }",
