The goal is to identify two specific line items:\n   - Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit (Accounts Receivable).\n   - Amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit (Accounts Payable).\n\n2. Looking at the table:\n   - \"Accounts Receivable\" shows amounts owed to the entity for sold goods/services on credit.\n   - \"Accounts Payable\" shows amounts owed by the entity for purchased goods/services on credit.\n\n3. For both line items, we are interested in their initial and end values.\n\n4. Extracted values:\n   - Accounts Receivable:\n     - Initial: 0.00\n     - Final: 2,498,141.24\n   - Accounts Payable:\n     - Initial: 0.00\n     - Final: 3,010,000.00\n\nThese match the two specific line items, maintaining the original order.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '0.00', 'end valu1': '2498141.24', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '3010000.00'}}\n```",
