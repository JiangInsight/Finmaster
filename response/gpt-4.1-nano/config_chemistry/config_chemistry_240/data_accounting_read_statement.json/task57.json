Initial Accounts Payable (2023-12-31): 0.00\n2. End Accounts Payable (2024-01-28): 3,010,000.00\n3. Increase in Accounts Payable = 3,010,000.00 - 0.00 = 3,010,000.00\n\nThis increase reflects the amount of credit purchases made during the period that have not yet been paid.\n\nThe specific line item: **\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\"** from cash flow statements also confirms this:\n- From the first problem: 1,590,000.00\n- From the second problem: 3,010,000.00\n\nBetween the two, the second problem's Accounts Payable change is 3,010,000.00, which is the actual increase in liabilities owed from credit purchases in that period.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"3010000.00\"}}\n```",
