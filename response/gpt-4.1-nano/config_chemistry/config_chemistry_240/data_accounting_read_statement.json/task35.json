Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers:\n   - This generally corresponds to **\"Cost of Goods Sold\"**.\n   \n2. Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation:\n   - This is reflected in **\"Financial Expenses\"**.\n   \n3. The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life:\n   - This is **\"Depreciation\"**.\n   \n4. Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period:\n   - This is **\"Tax Expense\"**.\n\nUsing the given data:\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 6720000.00\n- Financial Expenses: 523376.99\n- Depreciation: 45751.04\n- Tax Expense: 418090.41\n\nNow, let's format the answer accordingly.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '6720000.00', 'value2': '523376.99', 'value3': '45751.04', 'value4': '418090.41'}}\n```",
