So, total liabilities are **2,736,025.72**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[\n\\frac{-5,714,107.45}{2,736,025.72} \\approx -2.09\n\\]\n\nTo express this ratio clearly, often rounded to two decimal places: **-2.09**.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.09'} }\n```",
