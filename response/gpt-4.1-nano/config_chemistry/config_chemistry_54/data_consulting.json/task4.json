Total liabilities given directly are the current liabilities:\n   - Accounts Payable = 2,390,000.00\n   - Taxes Payable = 346,025.72\n   - Total Liabilities = 2,390,000.00 + 346,025.72 = 2,736,025.72\n\n2. Total Owner's Equity at the end:\n   - 11,330,150.23\n\n3. Calculate the ratio:\n\\[ \\frac{2,736,025.72}{11,330,150.23} \\approx 0.2414 \\]\n\n4. Rounded to two decimal places:\n\\[ 0.24 \\]\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.24\"}}\n```",
