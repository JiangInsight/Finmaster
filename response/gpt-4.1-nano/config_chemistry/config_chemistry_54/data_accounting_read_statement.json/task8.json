Locate \"Accounts Payable\" in the table.\n2. Extract the initial amount (initial value) associated with Accounts Payable.\n3. Extract the end amount (end value) associated with Accounts Payable.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Initial amount for Accounts Payable: 0.00\n- End amount for Accounts Payable: 2,390,000.00\n\nThese figures represent the initial and final balances of amounts owed for credit purchases.\n\nTherefore, the extracted amounts are:\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- End value: 2,390,000.00\n\nThis accounts for the initial and final balance of liabilities related to credit purchases.\n\nFinal answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '2390000.00'}}\n```",
