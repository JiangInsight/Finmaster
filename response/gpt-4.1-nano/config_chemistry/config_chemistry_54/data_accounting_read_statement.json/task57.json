The task is to find the specific line item and value representing the addition to the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.\n\n2. Key accounts related to liabilities for goods or services purchased on credit are usually \"Accounts Payable.\"\n\n3. Check the change in \"Accounts Payable\" from the start to the end of the period:\n   - Initial Amount: 0.00\n   - End Amount: 2,390,000.00\n\n4. The increase in \"Accounts Payable\" during the period:\n   2,390,000.00 - 0.00 = 2,390,000.00\n\nThis increase represents the additional amount owed for goods or services purchased on credit during the period.\n\n**Therefore, the value of the addition to the amount owed for purchases on credit is 2,390,000.00.**\n\nHere's the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"2390000.00\"}}\n```",
