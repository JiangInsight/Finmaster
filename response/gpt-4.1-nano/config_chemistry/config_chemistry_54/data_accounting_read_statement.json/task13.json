Examine the line items representing assets.\n2. Focus on non-current assets, since these typically are not expected to be realized or consumed within the normal operating cycle.\n3. Identify the initial and final values of these non-current assets.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Fixed Assets (initial: 5000000.00, final: 6446972.73)\n- Accumulated Depreciation (initial: 0.00, final: 45742.50) â€” but since depreciation is a contra-asset, it adjusts fixed assets.\n- Total Non-current Assets: initial 5000000.00, final 6401230.23\n\nBecause total non-current assets include fixed assets net of depreciation, the specific item of interest that is not expected to be realized or consumed normally are **Fixed Assets** and the relevant accumulated depreciation.\n\nThus, the key line items are Fixed Assets with initial and final values.\n\nAnswer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '6446972.73'}}\n```",
