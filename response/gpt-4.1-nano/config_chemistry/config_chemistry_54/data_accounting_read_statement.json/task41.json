Review the provided cash flow statement details.\n2. Look for line items related to taxes, specifically \"Tax Payable\" or similar.\n3. Focus on the line \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable,\" which indicates the change in tax liabilities that are accrued but not yet paid.\n4. Identify the value associated with this line item:\n   - For 2024-01-31, the line \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" has a value of 346025.72.\n5. Since the task is to identify the increase in accrued but unpaid taxes, the relevant line item is \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable,\" and the value signifies an increase (positive number).\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '346025.72'}}\n```",
