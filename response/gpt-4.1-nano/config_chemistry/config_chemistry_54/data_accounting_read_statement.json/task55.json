Look for references to taxes payable, tax expense, or tax-related line items in the balance sheet, cash flow statement, or income statement.\n\n2. In the balance sheet, there is a line item \"Taxes Payable\" with an \"End_amount\" of 346,025.72 for the latest reporting date, which indicates the amount of tax the entity expects to pay during that period.\n\n3. In the cash flow statement, \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" shows 346,025.72, matching the \"Taxes Payable\" in the balance sheet, confirming the amount of taxes payable during the period.\n\n4. The income statement lists \"Tax Expense\" as 346,025.72, which is typically the amount of taxes expense recognized during the period.\n\nSince all these sources are consistent, and the task asks specifically for the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay or recover during the reporting period, the most accurate figure corresponds to the \"Taxes Payable\" line, representing the amount owed by the entity at the end of the period.\n\n**Therefore, the total amount of tax expected to pay during the period is 346,025.72.**\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '346025.72'} }\n```",
