The first line item needed: **the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**.  \n   - This is typically represented by \"Accounts Payable\" in the cash flow statement.\n   - The relevant figure is the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable,\" which shows the change during the period.\n   - From the statement: **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable** = 2,390,000.00\n\n2. The second line item: **acquisition of property, plant, and equipment**.  \n   - This is generally represented as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n   - From the statement: **Purchase of Fixed Assets** = 1,446,972.73\n\n3. The third line item: **cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period**.  \n   - This is directly listed as \"Beginning Balance\" in the statement.\n   - From the statement: **Beginning Balance** = 8,000,000.00\n\nKeeping the order consistent with the input:\n\n- First: **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable** = 2,390,000.00\n- Second: **Purchase of Fixed Assets** = 1,446,972.73\n- Third: **Beginning Balance** = 8,000,000.00\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2390000.00', 'value2': '1446972.73', 'value3': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
