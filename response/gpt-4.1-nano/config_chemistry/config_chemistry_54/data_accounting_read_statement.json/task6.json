We are asked to identify tangible items held for use in production, supply of goods/services, rental to others, or administrative purposes, including their initial and final values.\n\n2. Typically, such assets are classified as \"Fixed Assets\" in a balance sheet.\n\n3. Looking at the provided data:\n   - \"Fixed Assets\" initially are 5,000,000.00\n   - \"Fixed Assets\" at the end are 6,446,972.73\n\n4. The inventory, accounts receivable, cash, and deposits are current assets and thus do not fall under tangible fixed assets for use in production or administrative purposes.\n\n5. Therefore, the relevant line items are \"Fixed Assets\" with initial and final values.\n\nThe initial value of fixed assets is 5,000,000.00, and the final value is 6,446,972.73.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"5000000.00\", \"end value\": \"6446972.73\"}}\n```",
