The profit after all expenses (which is the net profit).\n2. The cash payment for property, plant, and equipment (which is the purchase of fixed assets).\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n- The profit retained after expenses is typically represented by the \"Net Profit\" figure.\n\n- The cash payments for property, plant, and equipment are represented by \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" (or similar line items in the cash flow statement).\n\nNow, extracting these values from the provided data:\n\n- Net Profit (Net income after all expenses): **-1669849.77**\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (cash paid for property, plant, and equipment): **1446972.73**\n\nFinally, formatting the answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '-1669849.77', 'value2': '1446972.73'}}\n```",
