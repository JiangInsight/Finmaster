                        "content": "To identify and extract the specific line items of assets held for sale, we need to look for assets that are specifically characterized as \"held for sale,\" \"in production for sale,\" or \"in the process of being manufactured.\" These are typically classified under current assets, especially inventory and other assets directly associated with such sale processes.\n\nExamining the provided data:\n\n1. Inventory appears to be a primary candidate, as it often includes assets in production or in the process of being manufactured for sale.\n2. Other asset accounts like \"Cash on Hand,\" \"Bank Deposits,\" \"Interest Receivable,\" and \"Accounts Receivable\" are not characterized as assets held for sale.\n3. Fixed assets are not typically held for sale unless explicitly stated, and depreciation suggests ongoing use rather than sale.\n\nIn both the initial and end balances, the \"Inventory\" account shows a significant amount (initial: 0, final: 3,900,000) and is the most relevant line item representing assets in the process of being manufactured or held for sale.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and value of assets held for sale in this context is the \"Inventory\" account.\n\n**Initial value:** 0.00  \n**Final value:** 3,900,000.00\n\n---\n\n**Final answer in the required JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3900000.00'}}\n```",
