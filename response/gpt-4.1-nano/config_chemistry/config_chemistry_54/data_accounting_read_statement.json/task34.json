Given the context and the task, the primary source of income from ordinary activities is usually the \"Total Revenue\" figure, which sums up actual income from the core operations.\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**:  \n   This is generally the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS). It reflects the cost associated with inventories that were sold during the period.\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**:  \n   This is represented by \"Administrative Expenses\".\n\nNow, extracting from the given data:\n\n- Total revenue: 6920513.79\n- Cost of goods sold: 5580000.00\n- Administrative expenses: 1241966.86\n\n**Final answer in the required format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '6920513.79', 'value2': '5580000.00', 'value3': '1241966.86'}}\n```",
