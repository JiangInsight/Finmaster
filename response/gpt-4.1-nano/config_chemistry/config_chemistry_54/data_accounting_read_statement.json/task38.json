Look for a line item related to \"Accounts Payable\" which represents amounts owed by the entity for goods and services received on credit.\n2. The line \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Payable\" indicates the change in obligations owed to the entity.\n3. A decrease (a negative amount) in Accounts Payable means the entity has paid off some of its liabilities, thus decreasing the amounts owed.\n\nIn the provided data:\n- The line \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Payable\" shows \"2390000.00\" with a positive sign, indicating an increase in payable.\n- The opposite, a decrease, would be represented by a negative figure. Since positive indicates an increase, the decrease would be captured by a negative of this amount.\n\nTherefore, the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services provided on credit is **-2390000.00**.\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-2390000.00\"}}\n```",
