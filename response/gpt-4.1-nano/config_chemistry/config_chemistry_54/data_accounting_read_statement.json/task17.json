The task is to identify and extract two specific line items related to credit sales and credit purchases:\n   - Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit (i.e., Accounts Receivable).\n   - Amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit (i.e., Accounts Payable).\n\n2. We're given the initial and end amounts for these accounts, along with their account names.\n\n3. According to the data:\n   - Accounts Receivable is the line item representing amounts the entity is owed for sales on credit.\n   - Accounts Payable is the line item representing amounts owed to suppliers for purchases on credit.\n\n4. Therefore:\n   - Initial value of Accounts Receivable: 0.00\n   - End value of Accounts Receivable: 2,923,459.19\n   - Initial value of Accounts Payable: 0.00\n   - End value of Accounts Payable: 2,390,000.00\n\n5. We maintain the order as per the problem statement, which is Accounts Receivable first, then Accounts Payable.\n\nNow, formatting the answer accordingly:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '0.00', 'end valu1': '2923459.19', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '2390000.00'}}\n```",
