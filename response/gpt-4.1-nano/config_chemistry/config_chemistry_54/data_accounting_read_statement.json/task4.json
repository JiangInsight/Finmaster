The accounts related to interest receivable are likely labeled as \"Interest Receivable.\"\n3. We need to identify the initial and final amounts for \"Interest Receivable\" from the data.\n\nIn the data given:\n\n- Initial amount of \"Interest Receivable\" on 2023-12-31: 0.00\n- End amount of \"Interest Receivable\" on 2024-01-31: 2566.71\n\nThis indicates that interest was accrued during the period and has not yet been received, as shown by the increase from 0 to 2566.71.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item of interest accrued but not yet received is \"Interest Receivable\" with initial and final values as above.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '2566.71'} }\n```",
