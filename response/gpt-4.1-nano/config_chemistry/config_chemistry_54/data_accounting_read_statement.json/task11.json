The problem asks for the line items that represent the profit or loss retained in the entity, i.e., the retained earnings, including initial and final values.\n\n2. From the provided balance sheets:\n    - Retained Earnings at initial date: 0.00\n    - Retained Earnings at end date: -1669849.77\n\n3. The change in retained earnings shows a decrease of 1,669,849.77, indicating a loss or decrease retained in the entity during the period.\n\n4. Since initial retained earnings are zero and final are negative, the retained profit/loss retained in the entity is the final value.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item is \"Retained Earnings\" with initial value 0.00 and final value -1669849.77.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"-1669849.77\"}}\n```",
