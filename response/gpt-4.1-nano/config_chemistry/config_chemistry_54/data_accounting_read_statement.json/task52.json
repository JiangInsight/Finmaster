                        "content": "First, I need to identify the line item that represents the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares, which is typically labeled as \"Paid-in Capital\" or similar.\n\nFrom the balance sheet sections provided for both problems:\n\n- In the first example, the \"Paid-in Capital\" value is 13,000,000.00 initially and remains the same at the end.\n\n- In the second problem, the \"Paid-in Capital\" is also 13,000,000.00 initially and remains unchanged at the end.\n\nSince \"Paid-in Capital\" explicitly refers to the amount contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares, it is the relevant line item.\n\nFurthermore, the question asks to identify both initial and final values of this contribution, which are indicated clearly as 13,000,000.00 at both points in time.\n\nThus, the specific line items are \"Paid-in Capital\" with initial value 13,000,000.00 and end value 13,000,000.00 in both cases. Given the instruction, I will present the solution based on the second problem provided.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"13000000.00\", \"end value\": \"13000000.00\"}}\n```",
