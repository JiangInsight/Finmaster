Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n**Step 1: Costs to secure and deliver customer orders, and to deliver goods/services.**  \n- In an income statement, these costs are often represented as \"Selling Expenses\" and \"Administrative Expenses,\" which include costs related to sales efforts and order fulfillment.\n- Summing \"Selling Expenses\" and \"Administrative Expenses\" and considering depreciation as part of operating costs, these are typical line items associated with costs to secure and deliver services.\n\n**In the provided income statements:**\n\n- First problem:\n  - Selling Expenses: 493,854.67\n  - Administrative Expenses: 1,425,164.20\n  - Depreciation (may be included in operating costs): 45,751.41\n\n- Second problem:\n  - Selling Expenses: 630,420.28\n  - Administrative Expenses: 1,241,966.86\n  - Depreciation: 45,742.50\n\nAdding these gives us a clear view of the total costs related to sales and administration.\n\n**Step 2: Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment (PPE) and other long-term assets**\n\n- In cash flow from investing activities, the key line item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which reflects cash spent on PPE and long-term assets.\n\n- First problem:\n  - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 305,354.43\n\n- Second problem:\n  - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 1,446,972.73\n\n**Final step:**\n\n- For the first problem:\n  - Costs to secure and deliver orders/services:\n    - Sum: Selling Expenses + Administrative Expenses + Depreciation\n    - = 493,854.67 + 1,425,164.20 + 45,751.41 = 1,964,770.28\n\n- For the second problem:\n  - Sum: 630,420.28 + 1,241,966.86 + 45,742.50 = 1,918,129.64\n\n- The cash payments for PPE are directly the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the cash flow statements:\n  - First: 305,354.43\n  - Second: 1,446,972.73\n\n**Answer in the required format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"1964770.28\", \"value2\": \"305354.43\"}}\n```",
