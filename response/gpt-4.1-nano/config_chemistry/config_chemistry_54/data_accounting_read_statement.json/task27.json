Review the income statement for a line that represents depreciation expenses.\n2. Confirm that \"Depreciation\" is explicitly listed as a line item.\n3. Extract the value associated with \"Depreciation,\" which is 45742.50.\n4. The value of depreciation represents the accumulated systematic allocation of the depreciable amount over the asset's useful life.\n\nAnswer:\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45742.50'} }",
