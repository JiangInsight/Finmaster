The cost incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services: This is typically related to sales and delivery costs; in the income statement, \"Selling Expenses\" often cover costs related to securing and delivering orders.\n2. The financing costs incurred to raise funds: Usually labeled as \"Financial Expenses.\"\n3. The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount over its useful life: This is the \"Depreciation.\"\n4. Total amount of taxes payable or recoverable: This is \"Tax Expense.\"\n\nNow, I will extract these values from the provided income statement:\n\n- Selling Expenses (costs to secure and deliver): 630420.28\n- Financial Expenses (financing costs): 748774.91\n- Depreciation (systematic allocation of asset amortization): 45742.50\n- Tax Expense (taxes payable): 346025.72\n\nFinally, I will present these in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"630420.28\", \"value2\": \"748774.91\", \"value3\": \"45742.50\", \"value4\": \"346025.72\"}}\n```",
