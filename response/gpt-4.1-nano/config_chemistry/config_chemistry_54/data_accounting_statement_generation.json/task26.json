The slight difference likely reflects rounding or minor accounting adjustments, but the key point is the most recent depreciation recorded is 45751.41.\n\nStep 3: Confirm the last recorded depreciation\n- The latest and most relevant depreciation entry in the aggregated data is 45751.41, occurring on 2024-01-01.\n\nTherefore, the final depreciation entry in the income statement is 45751.41.\n\nAnswer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Depreciation\": \"45751.41\"} }\n```",
