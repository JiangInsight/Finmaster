Considering the detailed entries, the net change in the recorded interest receivable is about **-2672.87**, which likely reflects the total decrease after considering all transactions and write-offs.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n{\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-2672.87\"}\n\n---\n\n**Final JSON output:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": \"-2672.87\"}}\n```",
