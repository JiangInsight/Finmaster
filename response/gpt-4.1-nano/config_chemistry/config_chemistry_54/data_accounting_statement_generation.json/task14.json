                        "content": "To determine the current liabilities at the initial and final points, we need to identify transactions related to liabilities, particularly focusing on \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Interest Payables/Receivables\" that are unpaid at each stage.\n\n**Step 1: Identify initial liabilities**  \nInitial assets include cash, bank deposits, and fixed assets. There are no explicit initial liabilities recorded as payables or interest obligations at the start because all initial data only shows assets.\n\n**Initial liabilities:**\n- Since the starting data contains no unpaid liabilities, the initial total current liabilities are **0.00**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate final liabilities**  \nAt the end, liabilities mainly include unpaid interest receivables and unpaid supplier debts.\n\n- Unpaid interest receivables are indicated as \"Interest Receivables\" with statuses \"Unpaid\" in numerous transactions.\n- Unpaid supplier bills are \"Purchase\" transactions marked as \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Payable\" in the payment method.\n\n**Gather unpaid interest receivables at the end:**\n\nFrom the dataset, unpaid interest receivables are repeatedly shown as entries with \"Interest Receivables\" and status \"Unpaid,\" with small amounts around 13. or 16. in each batch, ending close to the last date.\n\n**Unpaid interest receivables sum:**\n\n- 13.310501799999995 (multiple entries with similar amounts)\n- There are multiple such entries across the dataset.\n\nAdding them carefully from the latest entries:\n\n- On 2024-01-31: 9.169427029999996\n- Summing all \"Interest Receivables\" with \"Unpaid\" status:\n  - Let's sum all \"Interest Receivables\" with \"Unpaid\" status.\n\nFrom the dataset, the recent unpaid interests:\n\n- 16.433455729999995\n- 13.310501799999995\n- 84.51050179999999\n- 84.51050179999999\n- 16.870501799999996\n- 13.310501799999995\n- 84.51050179999999\n- 16.433455729999995\n- 13.310501799999995\n- 84.51050179999999\n- 16.870501799999996\n- 16.433455729999995\n- 84.51050179999999\n- 13.310501799999995\n- 84.51050179999999\n- 13.310501799999995\n- 84.51050179999999\n\nSum of unpaid interest receivables:\n\nSum = 16.43345573 + 13.3105018 + 84.5105018 + 84.5105018 + 16.8705018 + 13.3105018 + 84.5105018 + 16.43345573 + 13.3105018 + 84.5105018 + 16.8705018 + 16.43345573 + 84.5105018 + 13.3105018 + 84.5105018 + 13.3105018 + 84.5105018\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\nTotal interest receivable unpaid:\n\n(16.43345573 + 13.3105018 + 84.5105018 + 84.5105018 + 16.8705018 + 13.3105018 + 84.5105018 + 16.43345573 + 13.3105018 + 84.5105018 + 16.8705018 + 16.43345573 + 84.5105018 + 13.3105018 + 84.5105018 + 13.3105018 + 84.5105018) ≈\n\nLet’s sum:\n\n- 16.43345573 + 13.3105018 = 29.74395753\n- + 84.5105018 = 114.25445933\n- + 84.5105018 = 198.76496113\n- + 16.8705018 = 215.63546293\n- + 13.3105018 = 228.94596473\n- + 84.5105018 = 313.45646653\n- + 16.43345573 = 329.88992226\n- + 13.3105018 = 343.20042406\n- + 84.5105018 = 427.71092586\n- + 16.8705018 = 444.58142766\n- + 16.43345573 = 461.01488339\n- + 84.5105018 = 545.52538519\n- + 13.3105018 = 558.835887\n- + 84.5105018 = 643.3463888\n- + 13.3105018 = 656.6568906\n- + 84.5105018 = 741.1673924\n\nTotal unpaid interest receivables ≈ 741.17\n\n**Note:** There are no other liabilities explicitly marked as unpaid debts orPayables. \n\n**Total current liabilities at end:**\n\n- Unpaid interest receivables sum: **~741.17**\n\n- Unpaid supplier debts (accounts payable):\n\nLooking at \"Purchase\" transactions still marked as \"Unpaid\" (payment method \"Account Payable\"):\n\nUnpaid purchases:\n\n- On 2024-01-03: 90000.0 (payable S008)\n- Others also exist but are \"Paid\" or \"Unpaid\" with different amounts.\n\nFrom the last purchases:\n\n- 2023-12-31: 90000.0 (S008) unpaid → Add to liabilities\n- 2023-12-31: 240000.0 (S005) paid → ignore\n- 2023-12-31: 1400000.0 (S003) paid → ignore\n- 2023-12-31: 300000.0 (S008) paid → ignore\n- 2023-12-31: 60000.0 (S007) paid → ignore\n- 2023-12-31: 850,000 (S001) paid → ignore\n\nAdditionally, the detailed datasets show some unpaid bills, typically with \"Account Payable\" as the payment method.\n\n- For example, from the second dataset, on 2023-12-31, several unpaid bills are present in initial purchase entries with \"Account Payable.\"\n\nFrom the detailed list:\n\n- Latest unpaid bills exceeding 90,000 on various dates, but most are paid later.\n\nIn the revised data, the only remaining unpaid liabilities at the end are:\n\n- The purchase of 90,000 (S008) on 2023-12-31 in the second dataset (not paid). Since this is a valid unpaid payable at last, it adds to the liabilities.\n\nTotal unpaid supplier debts:\n\n- 90000.0\n\nTotal unpaid interest receivables:\n\n- ~741.17\n\n**Calculate total liabilities:**\n\nTotal Liabilities = Unpaid interest receivables + Unpaid supplier debts\n\n= 741.17 + 90000.0 ≈ **90741.17**\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\n**Final total liabilities:**\n\n- About **90741.17**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Initial liabilities: 0.00 (no unpaid liabilities at start)\n- Final liabilities: approx 90741.17\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"90741.17\"}}\n```",
