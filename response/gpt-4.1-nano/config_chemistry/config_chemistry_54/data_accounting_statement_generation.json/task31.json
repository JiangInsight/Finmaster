Typically, interest income is recognized when the interest is earned, regardless of whether it's paid or unpaid, but in accounting, interest receivable (unpaid interest earned) is considered interest income when accrued.\n\n2. **Extract interest receivable entries' amounts:**\n   Review all \"Interest Receivables\" entries:\n\n   -
