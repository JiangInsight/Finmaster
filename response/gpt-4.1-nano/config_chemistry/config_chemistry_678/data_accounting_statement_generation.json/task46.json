Since we're calculating cash flow, these are not outflows but internal transfers, so they don't affect cash balance directly.\n\n**Final Cash Balance Calculation:**\nStarting cash: 8,000,000.00\n\nAdd: total cash inflows: +3,098,410.29\n\nSubtract: total cash outflows: -2,834,020.06\n\nRemaining cash: 8,000,000 + 3,098,410.29 - 2,834,020.06 ≈ 8,264,390.23\n\nWe generally use two decimal places for reporting.\n\n**Result:**\n- Final cash and cash equivalents = approximately 8,264,390.23\n\n**Thus, the beginning balance of cash and cash equivalents at the start of the period is approximately 8,000,000, and after the period, it's approximately 8,264,390.23.**\n\nSince the task is to find the *final* beginning balance (which is the starting point for the current period in the cash flow statement after accounting for all inflows and outflows during the period), the final computed balance is:\n\n**Answer: 8,264,390.23**\n\nBut based on the available example response, the format uses a specified starting balance of 8,000,000.00.\n\nThe question asks for the starting balance in the cash flow statement, which equates to the *ending* balance of previous period, but generally, the \"final beginning cash\" for current period is the initial balance.\n\n**Given the initial starting point (initial deposit):** 8,000,000.00\n\nHowever, the example solution shows the starting balance after considering the transactions.\n\nConsidering the detailed analysis, the final *beginning* balance (after accounting for all transactions over the period) should be approximately:\n\n**Answer: 8,264,390.23**\n\nBut the example solution indicates the starting balance as 8,000,000.00, which seems to be the initial balance before any transaction.\n\nGiven the context and typical practice, the starting balance for the period is what was at the beginning of the period. Since initial deposits are recorded as 3,000,000 and 5,000,000, and no subsequent previous balance is provided, the initial balance can be taken as 8 million.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\"}}\n```",
