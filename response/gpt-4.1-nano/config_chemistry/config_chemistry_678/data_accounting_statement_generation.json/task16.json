Typically, paid-in capital only changes through issuance or withdrawal, which are not present here. All initial investments are recorded as initial contributions, and there are no new capital issuances or withdrawals recorded.\n\nNow, examine the latest transactions to determine if the paid-in capital changed by the end of the period.  \nThe last recorded totals for initial and final amounts should be consistent if no change occurred after the initial investment.\n\nSince no other transactions indicate an increase or decrease in paid-in capital, the final amount remains the same as the initial.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
