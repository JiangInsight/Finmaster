                        "content": "To calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio, we need the following formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\nIn typical financial analysis, \"Net Credit Sales\" is derived from sales revenue, assuming all sales are on credit unless specified otherwise. Given the data, the revenue figures provided are the total sales, which we will assume to be credit sales here.\n\n**Step 1: Extract necessary data**\n\n- **Total Revenue (or sales)**:\n\n  From the income statement for the latest period in each problem:\n\n  - For the first problem: \\$5,431,018.59\n  - For the second problem: \\$5,755,241.17\n\nWe will use these revenue figures as net credit sales for simplicity.\n\n- **Accounts Receivable at the beginning and end of period**:\n\n  - From balance sheet:\n\n    - First problem:\n\n      - Beginning (Initial_amount): \\$0.00 (on 2023-12-31)\n      - Ending (End_amount): \\$1,604,015.21 (on 2024-01-29)\n\n    - Second problem:\n\n      - Beginning: \\$0.00 (on 2023-12-31)\n      - Ending: \\$1,602,015.21 (on 2024-01-29)\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the average accounts receivable**\n\n- For the first problem:\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{0 + 1,604,015.21}{2} = 802,007.605\n  \\]\n\n- For the second problem:\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{0 + 1,602,015.21}{2} = 801,007.605\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the receivable turnover ratio**\n\n- First problem:\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{5,431,018.59}{802,007.605} \\approx 6.77\n  \\]\n\n- Second problem:\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{5,755,241.17}{801,007.605} \\approx 7.19\n  \\]\n\n**Final step: Present the answer**\n\nAssuming the user wants a single ratio based on these calculations, I'll provide the ratio for each problem separately.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"6.77\"}}\n```",
