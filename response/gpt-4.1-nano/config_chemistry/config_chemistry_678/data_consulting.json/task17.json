                        "content": "First, to compute the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio, we need two main components:\n\n1. **Cash Flow from Operating Activities (CFO)**\n2. **Total Debt (Liabilities)**\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Determine Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\nFrom the provided cash flow statements, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is given directly.\n\nFor the first problem:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = **-7,259,994.10**\n\nFor the second problem:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = **-7,724,112.71**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine Total Debt\n\nTotal debt is typically comprised of total liabilities, including both current and non-current liabilities.\n\nFor the first problem:\n- **Total Liabilities** = Total Current Liabilities + Total Non-current Liabilities\n- From the balance sheet:\n  - Total Current Liabilities = 1,861,550.92\n  - Total Non-current Liabilities (assumed to be primarily long-term debt) are not explicitly listed, but since the problem provides total liabilities, we can find total debt as total liabilities.\n\n- Total liabilities are not explicitly listed, but given the accounting equation:\n  Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Owner's Equity\n\n- For the first problem:\n  - Total Assets (End) = 13,216,409.49\n  - Owner's Equity (End) = 11,354,858.57\n  - Therefore,\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Liabilities} = \\text{Total Assets} - \\text{Owner's Equity} = 13,216,409.49 - 11,354,858.57 = 1,861,550.92\n  \\]\n\n- On the balance sheet, total liabilities are represented as \"Total Current Liabilities\", which is 1,861,550.92; since no additional non-current liabilities are provided, assume total debt equals total current liabilities.\n\nSimilarly, for the second problem:\n- Total Assets (End) = 12,385,382.42\n- Total Owner's Equity (End) = 11,647,620.37\n- Total Liabilities:\n  \n  \\[\n  12,385,382.42 - 11,647,620.37 = 737,762.05\n  \\]\n\n- Sum of \"Total Current Liabilities\" = 737,762.05, matching the total liabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Compute for both problems\n\n#### First problem:\n\\[\n\\frac{-7,259,994.10}{1,861,550.92} \\approx -3.90\n\\]\n\n#### Second problem:\n\\[\n\\frac{-7,724,112.71}{737,762.05} \\approx -10.47\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nSince only one solution field is requested, I will assume we're focusing on the first problem's result as per the example. Alternatively, if needed for both, could list both; but following the example, I will present the first problem's ratio.\n\n---\n\n### Output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-3.90\"}}\n```",
