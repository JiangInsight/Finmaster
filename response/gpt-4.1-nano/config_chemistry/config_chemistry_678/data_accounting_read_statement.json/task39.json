                        "content": "To find the reduction in assets held for sale during the period, we need to examine the cash flow statement details and identify the line item related to the decrease in such assets.\n\nKey points:\n- The relevant line item is the \"reduction in the amount of assets held for sale.\"\n- This typically appears as a decrease (or outflow) related to assets held for sale, which might be recorded explicitly or implied in the cash flows under investing activities.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n1. Look at the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section, as assets held for sale are classified as assets and would impact investing cash flows.\n2. The line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" indicates investment in fixed assets, which is not directly related.\n3. No specific line item explicitly mentions assets held for sale; however, the prompt focuses on the **reduction** of such assets, i.e., assets sold or derecognized.\n4. Since the cash flow statement shows \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" as 480,116.37, there's no explicit sale or disposal of assets listed here.\n5. The question implies that the reduction in assets held for sale is reflected as a cash inflow or outflow during the period.\n6. Given the overall change in cash and assets, and the nature of such transactions, a significant decrease in assets held for sale might be reflected as a large inflow in \"Proceeds from sale of assets\" if present, but it is not explicitly listed here.\n7. The key indicator here is that the net cash flow from investing activities is negative (-480,116.37), representing purchases rather than sales, hence no indication of reduction in assets held for sale.\n\nConclusion:\n- Since no explicit line item of assets held for sale is present, and the question asks for the \"reduction\" value, then the decrease in assets held for sale is best reflected by the change in the related asset account.\n- The prompt and the example suggest that if there was a reduction, it would be explicitly reported as a line item, but here, the only relevant figure related to asset disposal/sale is absent.\n\nGiven this, the most accurate is to report zero reduction since no explicit transaction aligning with assets held for sale is given.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'} }\n```",
