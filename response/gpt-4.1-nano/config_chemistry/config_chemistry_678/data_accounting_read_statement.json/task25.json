Typically, in such cases, \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is associated directly with delivery, and \"Selling Expenses\" relate to securing orders. \n\nIn the example's format, they extract only the selling expenses directly related to securing orders. Following that pattern, the most specific cost for securing customer orders is **Selling Expenses**.\n\n**Final answer**: \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '463643.51'} }\n```",
