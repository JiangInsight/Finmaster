Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities:\n   - This is typically represented by \"Total Revenue\" or similar.\n   - In the provided statement, \"Total Revenue\" is 5755241.17 on 2024-01-29.\n\n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period:\n   - This is generally reflected by \"Cost of Goods Sold\" or similar.\n   - Here, \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is 4680000.00 on 2024-01-29.\n\n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole:\n   - This usually corresponds to \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n   - In the statement, \"Administrative Expenses\" amount to 1082287.97 on 2024-01-29.\n\nMaintaining the original order as shown:\n\n- Total income: Total Revenue = 5755241.17\n- Inventories sold: Cost of Goods Sold = 4680000.00\n- General management and administration costs: Administrative Expenses = 1082287.97\n\nNow, formatting the answer accordingly:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5755241.17', 'value2': '4680000.00', 'value3': '1082287.97'}}\n```",
