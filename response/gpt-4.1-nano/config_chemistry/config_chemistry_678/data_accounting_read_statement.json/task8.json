Initial amount of Accounts Payable: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n2. End amount of Accounts Payable: 450,000.00 (as of 2024-01-29)\n3. The change in Accounts Payable over the period indicates the credit purchases made that are still owed at the end of the period.\n\nTherefore:\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- Final value: 450,000.00\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '450000.00'}}\n```",
