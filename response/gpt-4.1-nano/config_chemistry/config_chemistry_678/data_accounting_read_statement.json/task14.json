Locate the line item \"Total Current Liabilities\" in the provided data.\n2. The initial value at the start date is 0.00.\n3. The final value at the end date is 737,762.05.\n4. Since current liabilities are generally payable within the short-term operating cycle, this line item is relevant for the task.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item of liabilities expected to be settled in the normal course of the operating cycle is \"Total Current Liabilities,\" with a final value of 737,762.05.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"737762.05\"}}\n```",
