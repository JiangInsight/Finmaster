Identify the account that reflects retained earnings or accumulated profit/loss kept within the company rather than distributed to shareholders.\n2. The \"Retained Earnings\" account shows a starting value of 0.00 and an ending value of -1352379.63, indicating a loss retained in the entity (since it's negative).\n3. This account's change from 0.00 to -1352379.63 represents the profit or loss that has been retained in the company, adjusting the accumulated retained earnings over the period.\n\nTherefore, the initial value of retained earnings was 0.00, and the final value is -1352379.63, indicating a loss retained.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '-1352379.63'}}\n```",
