While not immediately realized, they are intended for ongoing business operations.\n8. **Accumulated Depreciation**: Contra-asset account related to Fixed Assets.\n9. **Total Non-current Assets**: Sum of fixed assets net of depreciation.\n10. **Total Assets**: Sum of current and non-current assets.\n\nSince the task focuses on assets **expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal operating cycle**, the main line items are:\n\n- Cash on Hand\n- Bank Deposits\n- Interest Receivable\n- Accounts Receivable\n- Inventory\n\nThe initial and end values of total current assets (which include assets expected to be realized) are:\n\n- Initial total current assets: 8,000,000.00\n- End total current assets: 6,951,011.84\n\n**Therefore, the relevant total assets expected to be realized or for sale in the normal cycle are the total current assets.**\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '6951011.84'}}\n```",
