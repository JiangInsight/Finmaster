This is typically reflected in the \"Accounts Payable\" account, which records amounts owed to suppliers.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet:\n- The \"Accounts Payable\" at the beginning (2023-12-31) is 0.00.\n- The \"Accounts Payable\" at the end (2024-01-29) is 450,000.00.\n\nThe increase or addition in amount owed is calculated as:\nEnd amount - Initial amount = 450,000.00 - 0.00 = 450,000.00\n\nThus, the specific line item of the addition in the amount owed for goods or services purchased on credit is \"Accounts Payable,\" with a value of 450,000.00.\n\nNow, I will format this in the required JSON structure.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"450000.00\"}}\n```",
