The first required line item: \"the amount of profit an entity retains after all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, have been deducted from total revenue.\"\n\n   - In financial statements, this is typically represented by **Net Profit** or **Net Income**.\n   - From the data, the line \"Net Profit\" is given as -1,352,379.63.\n\n2. The second required line item: \"the cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.\"\n\n   - This is usually represented as **Purchase of Fixed Assets** or **Capital Expenditures**.\n   - In the data, \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is given as 480,116.37.\n\n**Note:** Although the problem references \"cash payments,\" the data directly shows \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which aligns with capital expenditures paid in cash.\n\n**Summary:**\n- First value: Net Profit = -1,352,379.63\n- Second value: Purchase of Fixed Assets = 480,116.37\n\nNow, let's encode these into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"-1352379.63\", \"value2\": \"480116.37\"}}\n```",
