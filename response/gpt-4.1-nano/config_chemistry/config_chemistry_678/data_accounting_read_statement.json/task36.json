Identify the line item that corresponds to net profit or net income.\n2. In the provided data, \"Net Profit\" shows the profit after all expenses have been deducted.\n3. For the given problem, the \"Net Profit\" value is -1,352,379.63.\n\nSince the net profit is negative, this indicates an overall loss rather than a profit, but it still represents the residual amount after all expenses.\n\nFinal answer: the value of profit (retained earnings) after expenses is -1,352,379.63.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-1352379.63\"}}\n```",
