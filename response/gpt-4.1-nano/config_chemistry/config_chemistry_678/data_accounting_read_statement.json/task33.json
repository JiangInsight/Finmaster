Income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities: This is usually represented by \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue.\" Since the task specifies \"income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities,\" the most precise line item is \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n\n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period: This corresponds to \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" which directly relates to inventories sold.\n\nNext, extract their amounts from the provided table:\n\n- Main Business Revenue: 5755241.17\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 4680000.00\n\nFinally, maintain the original line item order:\n\n- First, the income from core business activities.\n- Second, the amount of inventories sold during the period.\n\nSo, the output JSON should be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5755241.17', 'value2': '4680000.00'}}\n```",
