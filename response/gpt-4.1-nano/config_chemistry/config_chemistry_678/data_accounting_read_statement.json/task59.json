Interest accrued but not yet received – from the balance sheet, the relevant line is \"Interest Receivable,\" with the end amount as of 2024-01-29, which is 1225.71.\n\n2. Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period – from the cash flow statement, the line \"Net Increase\" represents this change in cash and cash equivalents. For the period ending 2024-01-29, it is -8,204,229.08.\n\nTherefore, the two extracted values are:\n\n- Interest Receivable end amount: 1225.71\n- Net increase in cash and cash equivalents: -8,204,229.08\n\nNow, I will present them in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1225.71', 'value2': '-8204229.08'}}\n```",
