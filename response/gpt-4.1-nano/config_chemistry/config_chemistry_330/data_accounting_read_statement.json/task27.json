The line item \"Depreciation\" reflects the expense for the period, which is part of the systematic allocation.\n2. It is usually listed as \"Depreciation\" or \"Depreciation Expense.\"\n3. In the provided income statement, the line \"Depreciation\" appears with the amount.\n4. The value of \"Depreciation\" in this statement is 45765.70, which represents the depreciation expense for the period, i.e., the allocation of the depreciable amount for that period.\n\nThus, the value of the accumulated systematic allocation over the asset's useful life (for the period) is 45765.70.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"45765.70\"}}\n```",
