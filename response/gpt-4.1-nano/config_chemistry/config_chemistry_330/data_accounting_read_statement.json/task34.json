The line item for total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities is typically the \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue\". Both are present, but \"Total Revenue\" usually represents the total income from the main operations.\n\n2. The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is given by \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n\n3. The costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole are represented by \"Administrative Expenses\".\n\nNow, extracting these items:\n\n- Total income arising in the course of ordinary activities: \"Total Revenue\" → 7099920.95\n- Inventories sold: \"Cost of Goods Sold\" → 5540000.00\n- Administrative expenses: \"Administrative Expenses\" → 1529708.19\n\nFinal answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '7099920.95', 'value2': '5540000.00', 'value3': '1529708.19'} }\n```",
