Identify the total income arising in the course of entityâ€™s ordinary activities:\n   - The total income is typically represented by \"Total Revenue\".\n   - From the data, \"Total Revenue\" is 7,099,920.95\n\n2. Extract the name and value of \"Total Income\":\n   - Name: Total Revenue\n   - Value: 7,099,920.95\n\n3. Decompose total income into sub-items (typically, main revenue components). Given the data, the primary revenue is \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n   - Since only \"Main Business Revenue\" is specified, this will be considered as the component sub-item.\n\n4. Present the initial and final values of this sub-item:\n   - Initial value (at the start of the period): 7,099,920.95\n   - Final value (at the end of the period): 7,099,920.95\n\nFollowing these steps, the answer will reflect the total income and its sub-item with associated values.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"7099920.95\", \"Main Business Revenue\": \"7099920.95\"}}\n```",
