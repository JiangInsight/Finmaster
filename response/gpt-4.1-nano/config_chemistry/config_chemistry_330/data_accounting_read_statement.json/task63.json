Identify the three required line items:**\n\n- **Net cash amount generated from the entity's principal revenue-producing activities (Operating Cash Flows):**\n  - From the cash flow statement: \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" \n- **Taxes accrued but not yet paid:**\n  - From the balance sheet: \"Taxes Payable\"\n  - From the cash flow statement: \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\"\n- **Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities:**\n  - From the income statement: \"Net Profit\" (as it reflects the profit after all revenues and expenses from ordinary operations)\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n**a. Extract the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:**\n\n- For the first problem:\n  - **Value:** `-5394333.52` (from the cash flow statement)\n  \n**b. Extract Taxes Payable:**\n\n- From balance sheet:\n  - **Value:** `354996.05`\n- The \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" on the cash flow statement confirms the accrual amount:\n  - **Value:** `354996.05`\n\n**c. Extract Total Income (Net Profit):**\n\n- From the income statement:\n  - **Value:** `-1175062.19`\n\n---\n\n### Final assembled answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5394333.52', 'value2': '354996.05', 'value3': '-1175062.19'}}\n```\n\n**Note:** The cash flow from operating activities is negative, indicating net outflow, consistent with the data.",
