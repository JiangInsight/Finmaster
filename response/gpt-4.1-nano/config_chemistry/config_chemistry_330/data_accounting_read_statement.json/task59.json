The net addition (increase or decrease) in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\nNext, I will analyze each section (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement) in order, looking for these specific items.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Find interest accrued but not yet received**\n\n- From the **Balance Sheet**, look for a line item related to interest receivable.\n\n- In the **balance sheet**, I see the line:\n\n  | Interest Receivable | ... | End_amount | 1731.44 |\n\n  - The initial amount was 0.00, now 1731.44, indicating interest accrued but not yet received.\n\n- From the **income statement**, interest income is recorded as 1731.44, confirming the interest income matches interest receivable.\n\n- From the **cash flow statement**, the decrease in interest receivable is shown as -1731.44, consistent with the balance sheet.\n\nThus, **interest accrued but not yet received** = 1731.44.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Find net addition in cash and cash equivalents**\n\n- From the **cash flow statement**, the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents is directly provided:\n\n  - For both cases, the \"Net Increase\" is negative, indicating a decrease.\n\n- For the first problem, the net increase is: **-7565348.53**\n\n- For the second problem, the net increase is: **-7659621.94**\n\n- Since the task asks for the net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period, I will select the net increase/decrease value as the net addition.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Interest accrued but not yet received: 1731.44\n- Net addition in cash and cash equivalents: the \"Net Increase\" from the cash flow statement.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"1731.44\", \"value2\": \"-7565348.53\"}}\n```",
