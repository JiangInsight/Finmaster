The question asks for the line item and value of capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares, including initial and final values.\n\n2. In a balance sheet, the relevant line item typically is \"Paid-in Capital\" or similar, representing the amount of capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares.\n\n3. Looking at the provided balance sheet data:\n   - Initial value of \"Paid-in Capital\": 13,000,000.00\n   - End value of \"Paid-in Capital\": 13,000,000.00\n\n4. There are no indications of additional share capital issuance or buybacks that would alter these values between initial and final periods.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- The initial capital contributed by shareholders (through shares) is 13,000,000.00.\n- The final capital contributed remains at 13,000,000.00.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"13000000.00\", \"end value\": \"13000000.00\"}}\n```",
