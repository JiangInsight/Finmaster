Common cash line items in such balance sheets include:\n   - Cash on Hand\n   - Bank Deposits\n\n2. The relevant line items for cash are:\n\n   - **Cash on Hand**: initial and end amounts\n   - **Bank Deposits**: initial and end amounts\n\n3. The initial value of cash (\"Cash on Hand\") is 3,000,000.00, and the final value is 145,666.48.\n\n4. The initial value of bank deposits is 5,000,000.00, and the final value is 194,711.58.\n\n5. To understand the total cash available for operations, sum these two line items:\n\n   - Initial total cash = 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 8,000,000.00\n   - Final total cash = 145,666.48 + 194,711.58 = 340,378.06\n\nHowever, the problem specifically asks for the \"initial and final value\" as per the example, so we need to present the total initial and final cash holdings:\n\n- Initial value: 8,000,000.00\n- Final value: 340,378.06\n\nBut based on the provided example, we are supposed to extract the total cash line items directly, which correspond to \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" combined.\n\nThe previous example demonstrated extracting and reporting another combined value; thus, the answer should be the sum of cash and bank deposits:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"340378.06\"}}\n```\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"340378.06\"}}\n```",
