                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided financial statements step by step according to the instructions:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the three specific line items\n\n#### From the Balance Sheet:\nWe need the \"end value of profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense\" â€” this is typically the **Net Profit (or Loss)**, which is shown in the income statement but ends up in retained earnings on the balance sheet.\n\nThe balance sheet contains:\n- **Retained Earnings** at end date: **-1175062.19** \n- **Total Owner's Equity**: **11824937.81** (not directly needed here)\n- The net profit figure is explicitly given in the income statement as **Net Profit: -1175062.19**.\n\n#### From the Income Statement:\n- The \"profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense\" is **Profit Before Tax**, which is **-820066.14** for the current period.\n\n#### From the Cash Flow Statement:\n- \"the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period\" refers to **Accounts Payable** increase/decrease (i.e., change during the period).  \n- **Accounts Payable at start:** 0.00 (from balance sheet initial amounts)  \n- **Accounts Payable at end:** 2700000.00\n\nChange in Accounts Payable:\n= 2700000.00 - 0.00 = **+2700000.00**\n\n- \"capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares\" is represented by the **Paid-in Capital**, which remains the same at **13000000.00**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Summarize the findings\n\n- Profit/Loss before tax (from Income Statement): **-820066.14**\n- Increase in accounts payable (credit purchases): **2700000.00**\n- Capital contributed by shareholders: **13000000.00**\n\n### Step 3: Format the output\n\nThe problem asks for the five values grouped in order (but only three specific line items are needed).\n\n\"Within each group, maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement.\"  \nThe instruction's example solution only shows three values.\n\nTherefore, the output should contain:\n\n- The sum of the three identified line items:\n   - **Value1:** Paid-in Capital\n   - **Value2:** Profit Before Tax\n   - **Value3:** Increase in Accounts Payable\n\nThe example output only includes three values, matching the three items of interest:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '-820066.14', 'value3': '2700000.00'} }\n```\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '-820066.14', 'value3': '2700000.00'} }\n```",
