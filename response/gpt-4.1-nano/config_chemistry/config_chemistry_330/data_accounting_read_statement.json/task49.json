The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.\n2. Acquisition of property, plant, and equipment.\n3. Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the addition in the amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.**  \nThis corresponds to the change in accounts payable, which reflects credit purchases.  \nFrom the statement:  \n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable | 2700000.00 | 2024-01-29 |  \nSince there is a positive change, it indicates an increase, meaning more goods or services were received on credit.  \n**Value:** 2700000.00\n\n**Step 2: Find the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment.**  \nThis is usually reported as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".  \nFrom the statement:  \n| Purchase of Fixed Assets | 2265288.42 | 2024-01-29 |  \n**Value:** 2265288.42\n\n**Step 3: Determine cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.**  \nThis is explicitly labeled as \"Beginning Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\".  \nFrom the statement:  \n| Beginning Balance | 8000000.00 | 2024-01-29 |  \n**Value:** 8000000.00\n\nThe line order as per the statement is:\n1. Accounts payable increase\n2. Purchase of fixed assets\n3. Beginning balance\n\nNow, formulating the output in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2700000.00', 'value2': '2265288.42', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
