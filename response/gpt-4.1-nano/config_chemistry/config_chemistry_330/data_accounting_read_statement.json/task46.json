According to the cash flow statement structure, these items are generally included in \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\"\n\nStep 1: Find \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" total, which is provided.\n\nStep 2: Decompose this total into components. Typically, this includes:\n- Purchase of fixed assets (capital expenditures, cash outflows)\n- Proceeds from sale/disposal of long-term assets (cash inflows)\n- Investment income (interest and dividends received)\n\nIn the provided data, the only elaborated component in the \"Investing Activities\" section is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nStep 3: Understand that net cash flow from investing activities = proceeds from asset sales/disposals - purchase of fixed assets + income from interest/dividends if available.\n\nObservation:\n- The only item explicitly related to asset disposal proceeds is not directly provided.\n- The only relevant detailed component is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which has a negative value, indicating cash outflow for acquiring assets.\n\nStep 4: Since no proceeds from asset disposal or income from interest/dividends are explicitly stated, the net cash flow from investing activities appears to be the only component provided.\n\nStep 5: The net \"cash flow from investing activities\" is given: -2265288.42.\n\nAssuming that this figure equals the sum of all relevant investments/disposals and incomes, and given the data, the only quantifiable sub-item is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nFinal step: Present the total investing cash flow and the component sub-item value.\n\nAnswer:\n- Total net cash flow from investing activities: -2265288.42\n- Sub-item (purchase of fixed assets): 2265288.42 (as cash outflow)\n\nNow, assemble the answer in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-2265288.42\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"2265288.42\"}}\n```",
