The key line item we are interested in is the net profit after deducting operating costs, interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. This is commonly represented as \"Net Profit\" or \"Net Income\".\n\n2. Reviewing the data:\n- \"Net Profit\" listed is -1175062.19\n- There are also depreciation and other adjustments, but since the question asks for the profit after all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, and \"Net Profit\" is generally the bottom-line figure after all these expenses are deducted, the relevant value should be the \"Net Profit\" figure.\n\n3. Therefore, the amount of profit retained, after all expenses are deducted, is **-1175062.19**.\n\nFinal Answer: the value is -1175062.19\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-1175062.19\"}}\n```",
