                        "content": "To identify the costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers, I need to focus on relevant line items in the income statement.\n\nTypically, costs related to securing customer orders and delivering goods/services are categorized under terms like \"cost of sales,\" \"cost of goods sold,\" \"selling expenses,\" or similar. \n\nIn this income statement:\n- \"Cost of Goods Sold\" generally represents the direct costs of producing goods sold.\n- \"Selling Expenses\" often include costs associated with securing orders (such as sales commissions, advertising, promotion).\n\nGiven the context, the costs specifically related to securing customer orders and delivering goods/services are likely encompassed within \"Selling Expenses,\" since it relates directly to the sales process and distribution.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify \"Cost of Goods Sold\" as the cost associated directly with production/delivery.\n2. Identify \"Selling Expenses\" as the costs associated with securing customer orders and the sales process.\n3. Both components are relevant and together represent costs related to securing orders and delivering services/goods.\n\nNow, selecting the line item \"Selling Expenses\" with the value 395,393.99 for the provided data.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"395393.99\"}}\n```",
