Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers:\n   - These are typically reflected as Selling Expenses and Administrative Expenses in the income statement.\n   - Usually referred to broadly as \"costs to secure customer orders\" (selling expenses) and \"costs to deliver goods/services\" (administrative expenses).\n   - In many cases, these costs are combined under Selling Expenses and Administrative Expenses.\n\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets:\n   - These are reflected in the Cash Flow Statement under investing activities, specifically as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nFrom the data provided:\n- In the income statement, the expenses related to selling and administrative activities are:\n  - Selling Expenses: 493,854.67 (for first problem data)\n  - Administrative Expenses: 1,425,164.20 (for first problem data)\n\n- In the cash flow statement, the purchase of fixed assets is:\n  - 305,354.43 (for the first problem's data)\n  - 226,528.88 (for the second problem's data)\n\nSince the task asks for the specific line items and their values related to these activities, we identify:\n- Line item for costs to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services: **Selling Expenses**\n- Line item for cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment: **Purchase of Fixed Assets**\n\nUsing the first set of example values for the first problem's data:\n- Selling Expenses: 493,854.67\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 305,354.43\n\nThe second problem data has similar categories:\n- Selling Expenses: 395,393.99\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 226,528.88\n\nGiven the problem's instruction to group the results similarly to previous examples and to present the values in a JSON object, the final answer includes the first set of values (from the first problem's data):\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"493854.67\", \"value2\": \"305354.43\"}}\n```\n\nThis matches the pattern seen in the example and the typical interpretation of these line items.\n\n**Final answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"493854.67\", \"value2\": \"305354.43\"}}\n```",
