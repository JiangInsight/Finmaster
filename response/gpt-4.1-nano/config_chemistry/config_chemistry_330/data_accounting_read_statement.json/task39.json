Typically, such reductions would be reflected in the cash flow statement within the investing activities, often under a line like \"Reduction in assets held for sale\" or similar wording.\n\nIn the provided cash flow statement, the relevant line appears under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" which may involve asset purchases, disposals, or reductions.\n\nWithin the provided data:\n- The \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is an acquisition (outflow), not a reduction.\n- The net cash flow from investing activities is negative, indicating overall net outflow.\n\nThe only clear figure relating to assets being moved or reduced is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\" Since the task is about reduction, assets held for sale would typically be disposed of or reduced, reflected as inflows rather than purchases.\n\nGiven no explicit line item in the provided data indicating assets held for sale being reduced, the closest related line is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which denotes asset acquisition, not reduction.\n\nHowever, since the task is about reduction, and the only outflow associated with asset disposal that affects assets for sale could be inferred from \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" negative figure, but more specifically, nothing explicitly mentions assets held for sale reduction.\n\nTherefore, based on the details, it appears no specific line item explicitly mentions the reduction of assets held for sale.\n\n**Alternatively**, if we consider a generic approach: the reduction would be a line like \"Assets held for sale (decrease)\" which isn't explicitly listed here.\n\n**Conclusion**: Since there's no line item clearly indicating the reduction of assets held for sale in the given statement, the most relevant figure related to the change in assets—particularly reductions—appears to be the decrease in inventory, which may include assets held for sale.\n\nBetween the options, the \"Decrease in Inventory\" is a plausible candidate as inventory can include assets held for sale, and its reduction might reflect such assets being disposed of.\n\n**Final answer**: The line item \"Decrease in Inventory\" with value \"-3760000.00\" appears to be the most relevant.\n\n---\n\n**Answer in the required JSON format:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-3760000.00\"}}\n```",
