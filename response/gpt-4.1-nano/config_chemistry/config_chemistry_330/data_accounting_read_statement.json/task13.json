                        "content": "To determine the total assets that are not expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle, we need to identify assets classified as non-current assets, which typically include fixed assets (like property, plant, and equipment) and other long-term assets. These are assets not expected to be converted into cash or used up within the normal operating cycle.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify non-current assets in the given data:**\n   - Fixed Assets\n   - Accumulated Depreciation (though negative, it's associated with Fixed Assets)\n   - Total Non-current Assets\n\n2. **Compare initial and end values of Total Non-current Assets:**\n   - Initial value (2023-12-31): 5,000,000.00\n   - End value (2024-01-29): 7,219,522.72\n\n3. **Consider both the initial and final amounts:**\n   - Since the question asks for the line items \"initial and final value,\" and explicitly about assets not expected to be realized or for sale or consumption, the total non-current assets are the combined line item of interest.\n\n4. **Result:**\n   - Initial value: 5,000,000.00\n   - End value: 7,219,522.72\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"5000000.00\", \"end value\": \"7219522.72\"}}\n```",
