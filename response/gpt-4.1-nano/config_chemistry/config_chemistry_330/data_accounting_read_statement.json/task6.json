The accumulated depreciation is related but typically represents accumulated usage/depreciation rather than the asset's original or ending value.\n\nTherefore, the key figures are:\n- Initial value of tangible items: sum of Initial values of Inventory and Fixed Assets\n- Final value of tangible items: sum of Final values of Inventory and Fixed Assets\n\nCalculations:\n- Initial total tangible assets = 0.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 5,000,000.00\n- Final total tangible assets = 3,760,000.00 + 7,265,288.42 = 11,025,288.42\n\nHowever, considering the task's example, it appears they focus on individual line items rather than summed totals, typically selecting the main fixed asset line and its associated figures.\n\nGiven the pattern, the most relevant fixed asset line for value change is:\n- Initial value: 5,000,000.00\n- Final value: 7,265,288.42\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '7265288.42'} }\n```",
