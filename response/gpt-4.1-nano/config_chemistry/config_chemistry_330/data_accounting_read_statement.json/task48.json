The goal is to find two specific line items:\n   - The amount of profit retained after all expenses (basically, net profit).\n   - The cash paid to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets (from investing activities).\n\n2. From the provided table:\n   - The \"Net Profit\" for the period is clearly listed.\n   - The \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" indicates cash paid for property, plant, and equipment (PP&E).\n\n3. We identify:\n   - \"Net Profit\" value: -1175062.19\n   - \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" value: 2265288.42\n\n4. According to the example, the first item is the net profit, and the second is the purchase of fixed assets.\n\n5. Final answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '-1175062.19', 'value2': '2265288.42'}}\n```",
