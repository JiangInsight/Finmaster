This expense reflects the depreciation allocation for the asset, which systematically reduces the asset's depreciable amount over its useful life.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the depreciation expense**:  \n   - From the cash flow statement, \"Depreciation\" is listed as 45,765.70.\n   - From the income statement, \"Depreciation\" is also listed as 45,765.70.\n\n2. **Confirm that this line item represents the systematic allocation**:  \n   Depreciation expense in financial statements is the systematic allocation of an assetâ€™s depreciable amount over its useful life.\n\n3. **Check the consistent value**:  \n   Both statements report the same depreciation amount: 45,765.70, confirming this is the relevant figure.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe value of the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life is **45,765.70**.\n\n**Final answer in the required format**:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"45765.70\"}}\n```",
