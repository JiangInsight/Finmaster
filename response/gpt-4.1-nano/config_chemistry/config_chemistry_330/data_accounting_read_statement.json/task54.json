                        "content": "To identify the costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers, we should look for relevant line items in the financial statements, typically found under Expenses in the income statement, specifically those related to selling, administrative, or delivery costs.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The key description points to costs associated with obtaining customer orders (sales or promotional expenses) and delivering goods/services (distribution/delivery expenses).\n2. In the provided income statements, the relevant line items are usually \"Selling Expenses\" (which often covers costs related to securing customer orders, such as marketing and sales commissions) and \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (which covers the costs associated with delivering the goods/services to customers).\n3. Since the task specifies costs \"to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services,\" the relevant line items are:\n   - \"Selling Expenses\" (costs for securing orders)\n   - \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (costs for delivering goods/services)\n4. From the first case:\n   - Selling Expenses: 493,854.67\n5. From the second case:\n   - Selling Expenses: 395,393.99\n6. The task asks to extract the sum of these specific costs or possibly the line item value.\n\nGiven the sample examples, the typical answer format presents only one value, likely the total of these related costs or a single key line item representing these combined efforts.\n\nTo comply with the example, I will choose the \"Selling Expenses\" as it directly relates to securing customer orders, or \"Cost of Goods Sold\" as it relates to delivering products.\n\nBut since the task likely focuses on the costs *to secure* orders and *to deliver* goods and services—covering both activities—it makes sense to sum the relevant expenses:\n\n- For the first case:\n  - Selling Expenses: 493,854.67\n- For the second case:\n  - Selling Expenses: 395,393.99\n\nTotal relevant costs = 493,854.67 + 395,393.99 = 889,248.66\n\nHowever, in the previous example, the answer contains only a **single line item value**, and the example selected the **Selling Expenses** line item value in the first case (493,854.67).\n\nHence, following the pattern, the answer should be the value for \"Selling Expenses\" from the relevant case.\n\n**Final decision:** The value of \"Selling Expenses\" for the second case is 395,393.99, which best captures costs incurred in securing customer orders and delivering goods/services.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '395393.99'} }\n```",
