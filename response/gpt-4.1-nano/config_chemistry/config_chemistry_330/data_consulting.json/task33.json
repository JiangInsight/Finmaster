                        "content": "Let's proceed step-by-step to calculate each of the six financial ratios based on the provided data.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities / Average Current Liabilities\n\nFirst, calculate Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities:\n\n- Given: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -5,394,333.52\n\nNext, determine the average current liabilities:\n\n- End current liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n- Beginning current liabilities = 1,861,550.92 (from previous problem's balance sheet)\n  \nAverage current liabilities = (1,861,550.92 + 3,054,996.05) / 2  \n= (1,861,550.92 + 3,054,996.05) / 2  \n= 4,916,546.97 / 2  \n= 2,458,273.48\n\nCalculate Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\n\n= -5,394,333.52 / 2,458,273.48  \n≈ -2.20\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities / Total Debt\n\nTotal debt typically includes current liabilities and long-term liabilities; here, only current liabilities are explicitly given.\n\nTotal debt (approximated) = 3,054,996.05 (current liabilities at end)\n\nUsing net cash flows from operating activities:\n\n= -5,394,333.52 / 3,054,996.05  \n≈ -1.77\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\n- COGS = 5,540,000.00 (from income statement)\n\nAverage Inventory:\n\n- Beginning inventory = 3,760,000.00\n- Ending inventory = 3,760,000.00 (both are the same in start/end)\n\nAverage Inventory = (0 + 3,760,000) / 2 (since start inventory was zero, assume only endpoint)\n\nUse ending inventory:\n\n= 3,760,000.00\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 5,540,000 / 3,760,000  \n≈ 1.47\n\n*(Note: Since starting inventory is zero, the average is just the endpoint value)*\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity\n\n- Total debt = 3,054,996.05 (current liabilities)\n- Shareholders' equity at end:\n\n  = 11,824,937.81\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 3,054,996.05 / 11,824,937.81  \n≈ 0.26\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nQuick Ratio = (Cash + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n\n- Cash on hand + Bank deposits + Interest receivable + Accounts receivable:\n\n  =(145,666.48 + 194,711.58 + 1,731.44 + 3,558,301.64) = 3,900,411.10\n\n- Current liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n\nQuick Ratio = 3,900,411.10 / 3,054,996.05  \n≈ 1.28\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Current Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nCurrent Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\n- Total current assets = 7,660,411.14\n- Total current liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n\nCurrent Ratio = 7,660,411.14 / 3,054,996.05  \n≈ 2.51\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Calculations:\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio ≈ -2.20\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio ≈ -1.77\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio ≈ 1.47\n- Debt to Equity Ratio ≈ 0.26\n- Quick Ratio ≈ 1.28\n- Current Ratio ≈ 2.51\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.20', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.77', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '1.47', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.26', 'Quick Ratio': '1.28', 'Current Ratio': '2.51'} }\n```",
