                        "content": "To calculate the Free Cash Flow (FCF), we typically start with the net cash flow from operating activities, then subtract capital expenditures (fixed assets purchases). In the provided data, the relevant figures are:\n\n- Net cash flow from operating activities\n- Purchase of fixed assets (capital expenditures)\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -5,394,333.52\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets = 2,265,288.42\n\nNote: The net cash flow from investing activities is also provided as -2,265,288.42, which confirms that the purchase of fixed assets is the main investing activity expense.\n\n**Step-by-step calculation:**\n\n1. Start with net cash flows from operating activities:\n   - Operating cash flow = -5,394,333.52\n\n2. Subtract the purchase of fixed assets:\n   - Fixed assets purchase = 2,265,288.42\n\n3. Calculate FCF:\n   \n   FCF = Operating cash flow - Capital expenditures\n\n   FCF = -5,394,333.52 - 2,265,288.42\n\n   FCF = -7,659,621.94\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-7659621.94\"}}\n```",
