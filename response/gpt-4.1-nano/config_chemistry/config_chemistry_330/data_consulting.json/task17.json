We'll proceed with this amount.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{-5,394,333.52}{3,054,996.05} \\approx -1.77\n\\]\n\nExpressed as a ratio, rounded to two decimal places:\n\n**-1.77**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-1.77\"}}\n```",
