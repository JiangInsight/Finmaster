Then, find the latest depreciation entry, as that would represent the final depreciation amount for the period.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Search for all entries where the \"type\" indicates depreciation, typically labeled as \"Depreciation.\"\n\n2. From the first dataset, note the depreciation entries:\n\n   - **Depreciation20240101001**: 45751.41 on 2024-01-01\n\n   - **Depreciation20240101001 (second entry)**: 45765.70 on 2024-01-01\n\n(Note: Both entries occur on the same date but have slightly different amounts, possibly from different assets. Since the goal is to find the final depreciation item, the last or most recent depreciation should be considered. Here, both are on the same date; pick the latest amount listed for that date.)\n\n3. The second depreciation entry (45765.70) is slightly higher and appears after the first; thus, it is likely the final depreciation amount for that date.\n\n4. The final depreciation amount in the cash flow statement is therefore 45765.70 (rounded to two decimal places).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe last (final) depreciation value listed is **45765.70**.\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Depreciation\": \"45765.70\"}}\n```",
