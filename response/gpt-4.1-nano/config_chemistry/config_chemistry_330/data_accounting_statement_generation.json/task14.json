Based on the data, typical current liabilities include:\n- Accounts payable (money owed to suppliers)\n- Unpaid expenses or accrued expenses\n- Interest payables (interest receivables unpaid)\n- Any other short-term payables or accrued liabilities\n\nNote:\n- \"Initial\" amounts are the balances at the beginning, before transactions.\n- \"Final\" amounts are the balances after all transactions.\n\n## Step 2: Identify initial balances\nFrom the first dataset provided, initial balances are:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000\n\nNo opening balances are explicitly provided for liabilities, so initial current liabilities are assumed to be zero.\n\n**Initial Total Current Liabilities = 0.00**\n\n## Step 3: Determine the final liabilities\nNext, analyze the transactions to identify unpaid liabilities at the end of the period.\n\n### Key transactions:\n- \"Unpaid\" payments: Several Sale Receivables labeled as \"Unpaid\", with associated interest receivables also unpaid.\n- Adjustments to receivables for interest receivables.\n- Accounts payable related to purchases marked as \"Unpaid\" (notably, one large unpaid purchase of 1,300,000.0).\n\n### Step 4: Summarize unpaid liabilities and receivables:\n- Unpaid interest receivables: \n  - 85.64790488999998 (multiple entries), \n  - 127.279827090000015, \n  - 85.64790488999998 (again), \n  - 127.91932975999998 (multiple), \n  - 85.64790488999998 (multiple), \n  - 127.91932975999998, \n  - 85.64790488999998, \n  - 127.91932975999998, \n  - 85.64790488999998, \n  - 127.91932975999998, \n  - 85.64790488999998, \n  - 127.91932975999998, \n  - 85.64790488999998, \n  - 127.91932975999998, \n  - 85.64790488999998, \n  - 127.91932975999998, \n  - 85.64790488999998, \n  - 127.92453 (roughly similar, but a slight difference in last decimal)\n  \n  To simplify, summing all these unpaid interest receivables:\n  \n  - There are many entries with approximate value around 85.65 and sometimes 127.92.\n  - Let's sum all unique unpaid interest receivables:\n    - 85.64790489 * 10 = approximately 856.479\n    - 127.91932976 * 10 = approximately 1,279.193\n    - Total interest receivables unpaid ≈ 856.479 + 1279.193 = 2135.67\n  \n  For a precise sum, count each and sum:\n  - 85.6479 * 11 = 942.1267\n  - 127.9193 * 11 = 1407.113\n  \n  Sum = 942.1267 + 1407.113 ≈ 2349.24 (approximate)\n\n- Unpaid accounts receivable:\n  - Multiple sales labeled \"Unpaid\" with amounts:\n    - 535,393.08\n    - 685,524.45\n    - 68078.0\n    - 113,413.10\n    - 128,279.10\n    - 274,875.35\n    - 51911.56\n    - 243,734.24\n    - 11013.22\n    - 672,035.10\n    - 222,945.60\n    - 184,093.47\n    - 193,000.83\n    - 124,688.16\n    - 246,676.98\n    - 50199.88\n    - 68078.0\n    - 60283.00\n    \n  Sum of unpaid receivables:\n  \n  Let's sum a representative subset for approximation:\n  - 535,393.08 + 685,524.45 + 68078.0 + 113,413.10 + 128,279.10 ≈ 1,530,687.83\n  \n  Add more large unpaid receivables:\n  - 274,875.35 + 51911.56 + 243,734.24 + 11013.22 + 672,035.10 ≈ 1,262,569.67\n  \n  Similarly, sum other unpaid receivables:\n  - 222,945.60 + 184,093.47 + 193,000.83 + 124,688.16 + 246,676.98 + 50199.88 + 68078.0 + 60283.00\n  \n  Approximate summation:\n  - Sum ≈ 1,530,688 + 1,262,570 + 1,021,190 (roughly)\n  \n  Total unpaid receivables ≈ 3,814,448.00\n\n- Unpaid purchase of 1,300,000 (of the purchase of 1,500,000)\n  - This is a direct account payable:\n\n  Outstanding payable ≈ 1,300,000\n\n### **Step 5: Final total current liabilities**\n\nAdd unpaid interest receivables:\n- Approx. 2,349.24\n\nAdd unpaid accounts receivable (though typically receivables are assets, but sometimes receivables are considered short-term assets and liabilities are specific payable items).\n\nIn our context, trade receivables (assets) are categorized separately from liabilities.\n\nLiabilities are owed amounts:\n- Accounts payable: 1,300,000\n- The unpaid interest receivables are receivables, not liabilities.\n\nThus, liabilities are primarily:\n- 1,300,000 (the unpaid purchase payable).\n\n### Step 6: Final answer\nNo other liabilities such as accrued expenses, unpaid expenses, or interest payable are explicitly mentioned or owed.\n\n**Therefore:**\n- Initial liabilities: 0\n- Final liabilities: 1,300,000 + interest receivables don't constitute liabilities, only receivables.\n\n## Final conclusion:\n- Total current liabilities initial value: 0.00\n- Total current liabilities end value: 1,300,000.00\n\n## Final answer in the required format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"1300000.00\"}}\n```",
