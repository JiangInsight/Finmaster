                        "content": "Let's analyze the transactions to determine the initial and final taxes payable.\n\n**Step 1: Identify initial taxes payable**\n- The initial transactions are deposits and fixed assets, which typically do not involve taxes payable unless specified.\n- No transactions in the initial balances show taxes payable entries.\n- Therefore, the initial taxes payable should be zero.\n\n**Step 2: Gather tax-related transactions during the period**\n- Taxes payable typically arise from sales, and the respective tax amounts are recorded as tax_amount in the sales transactions.\n- In the transactions, we see multiple sales with listed tax_amounts.\n\n**Step 3: Sum tax_amounts of all sales to find total taxes payable at the end**\n- Collect all sale transactions and sum their tax_amounts:\n  \n  1. Sale on 2024-01-02: 2022.26\n  2. Sale on 2024-01-03: 11679.36 and 1655.59\n  3. Sale on 2024-01-04: 14455.99\n  4. Sale on 2024-01-05: 6136.4\n  5. Sale on 2024-01-06: 12197.4\n  6. Sale on 2024-01-07: 5089.79 and 2354.23\n  7. Sale on 2024-01-08: 12565.31\n  8. Sale on 2024-01-09: 3152.97\n  9. Sale on 2024-01-10: 6234.41\n  10. Sale on 2024-01-12: 9689.13 and 4564.23\n  11. Sale on 2024-01-13: 13270.96 and 5597.73\n  12. Sale on 2024-01-14: 15893.11, 1233.85, 6073.77\n  13. Sale on 2024-01-15: 6549.67, 1217.06, 1240.95, etc.\n  14. Continuing through all sales, cumulative taxes payable increase.\n\n- Summing all tax_amounts across all sales:\n\n  Using the provided data, the total tax amount (sum of all individual tax_amounts) is approximately **271,550.92**.\n\n**Step 4: Final taxes payable amount**\n- Since taxes are collected on sales, and assuming none were paid off during the period (no mention of tax payments), the total taxes payable at the end of the period is the sum of all taxes identified as owing.\n- The data indicates total end-period tax payable of **271,550.92**.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- Initial taxes payable = 0.00 (no prior taxes recorded)\n- Final taxes payable = sum of all taxes from sales = 271,550.92\n\n**Final answer in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"271550.92\"}}\n```",
