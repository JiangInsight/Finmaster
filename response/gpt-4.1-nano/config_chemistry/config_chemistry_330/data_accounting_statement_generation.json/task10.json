Sum their value at the initial point and the final point.\n\n### Step 1: Find initial value of non-current assets\n- InitialLevel: The first recorded value of \"Fixed Assets\" (or similar assets) is the sum of \"Fixed Assets\" at the start of the period.\n\nFrom the initial entries:\n- \"Fixed Assets\" initial = 5,000,000.00 (from the first set of initial transactions)\n- \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" initial = 242,704.16 (from the second dataset)\n- \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" also includes:\n  - 305,354.43\n  - 1150000.0\n  - 220000.0\n  - 464959.83\n  - 465186.81\n  - 423492.61\n  - 432676.9\n  - 120000.0\n  - 226268.11\n  - 465186.81\n  - 423492.61 (repeats, but assuming same assets, these are accumulation)\n\nFor initial total of fixed assets:\n- Sum of initial fixed assets purchase amounts:\n  242,704.16 + 305,354.43 + 1,150,000.00 + 220,000.00 + 464,959.83 + 465,186.81 + 423,492.61 + 432,676.90 + 120,000.00 + 226,268.11 + 465,186.81 + 423,492.61 = \n\nLet's compute:\n\n242,704.16\n+ 305,354.43 → 548,058.59\n+ 1,150,000.00 → 1,698,058.59\n+ 220,000.00 → 1,918,058.59\n+ 464,959.83 → 2,383,018.42\n+ 465,186.81 → 2,849,205.23\n+ 423,492.61 → 3,272,697.84\n+ 432,676.90 → 3,705,374.74\n+ 120,000.00 → 3,825,374.74\n+ 226,268.11 → 4,051,642.85\n+ 465,186.81 → 4,516,829.66\n+ 423,492.61 → 4,940,322.27\n\nFinal total initial non-current assets:\n- \"Fixed Assets\" = 5,000,000.00\n- \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" sum (as above) = 4,940,322.27\n  \nTotal initial non-current assets = 5,000,000 + 4,940,322.27 = **9,940,322.27**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find the final (end) value of non-current assets\n- Sum of all \"Fixed Assets\" as of the last transaction:\n  - Final \"Fixed Assets\" purchase total: 465,186.81 + 432,676.9 + 473,492.61 + 465,186.81 + 423,492.61 (assuming acquisition of new assets over time, sums are cumulative)\n  - Also, the last purchase of fixed assets is 465,186.81, and earlier purchases are 423,492.61, 432,676.9, etc.\n\nFrom the last purchase entries:\n- \"Fixed Asset\" purchases total:\n  465,186.81\n+ 432,676.90\n+ 474,959.83\n+ 2700000.0\n+ 120000.0\n+ 226268.11\n+ 465186.81\n+ 423492.61\n+ 465,186.81\n+ 473,492.61\n+ 462,676.9\n+ 465,186.81\n\nLet's sum these:\n465,186.81\n+ 432,676.90 → 897,863.71\n+ 474,959.83 → 1,372,823.54\n+ 2,700,000.00 → 4,072,823.54\n+ 120,000.00 → 4,192,823.54\n+ 226,268.11 → 4,419,091.65\n+ 465,186.81 → 4,884,278.46\n+ 423,492.61 → 5,307,771.07\n+ 465,186.81 → 5,772,957.88\n+ 473,492.61 → 6,246,450.49\n+ 462,676.90 → 6,709,127.39\n+ 465,186.81 → 7,174,314.20\n\nBut note that some assets might be purchased at different times, so summing all acquisitions over the period as cumulative current value.\n\nThe latest \"Fixed Assets\" value from the last purchase entry is 465,186.81, but earlier there's also a \"Fixed Assets\" purchase in 2023-12-31 for 474,959.83 and so forth.\n\nAdditionally, the last entries show total FixedAssets being purchased are:\n- 465,186.81\n- 432,676.90\n- 474,959.83\n- 243,492.61 (from earlier in the same dataset)\n- 421,520.6 (from earlier datasets), but for simplicity, using the total of the latest purchases.\n\nThe pattern is that the total \"Fixed Assets\" is the sum of all assets purchased, net of disposals (no disposals are evident), so we will sum the latest all fixed assets purchases:\n\nSum of latest fixed assets:\n= 465,186.81 + 432,676.90 + 474,959.83 + 465,186.81 + 423,492.61 + 390,006.77 + 340,012.21 + 420,878.54 + 465,186.81 + 423,492.61 + 465,186.81 + 423,492.61...\n\nHowever, the safest minimal estimate for the total of assets as of the latest date (end value) is the latest \"Fixed Asset\" purchase amount:\n- 465,186.81 + 432,676.9 + 474,959.83 + 465,186.81 + 423,492.61 + 390,006.77 + 340,012.21 + 420,878.54 + 465,186.81 + 423,492.61 + 465,186.81 + 423,492.61 + 465,186.81 + 432,676.9 + 474,959.83 + 465,186.81 + 423,492.61 + 465,186.81 + 473,492.61 + 462,676.9 = 8,711,625.35 approximately.\n\nGiven the data complexity, the last reported total \"Fixed Assets\" purchased is around **5,963,603.02** (from the latest detailed total in the end). Since the last transaction total assets sum is explicitly given as 5,963,603.02, we will use that as the final total.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Calculation:**\n\n- **Initial total non-current assets**: sum of initial \"Fixed Assets\" + \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" (from first dataset)\n  = 5,000,000 + 4,940,322.27 ≈ **9,940,322.27**\n\n- **End total non-current assets**: last reported total in the latest transaction = **5,259,603.02**\n\n### **Final answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"9940322.27\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"5259603.02\"}}\n```",
