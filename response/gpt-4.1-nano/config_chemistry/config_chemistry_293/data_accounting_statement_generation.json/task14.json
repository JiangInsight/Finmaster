Let's check recent unpaid purchases:\n    - 2024-01-25: Purchase 260,000, but paid; no outstanding payable.\n    - 2024-01-26: Purchase 9398.96, paid.\n    - 2024-01-31: Purchase 130,000, unpaid, payable S005. So end of period liability:\n      - 130,000 (unpaid purchase).\n    - There are other unpaid purchase obligations:\n      - 2023-12-31, purchase of 1,500,000, but paid immediately on that date.\n      - 2023-12-31: purchase 1,000,000, paid.\n      - For the period, the only outstanding account payables appear to be:\n        - 2024-01-26: 9398.96 (paid early January, so settled).\n        - 2023-12-31: 1,000,000 paid.\n\n  The only remaining purchase obligation on the last date seems to be:\n  - 2024-01-31: purchase of 130,000 (unpaid).\n\nThus, **Total accounts payable as of the last date = 130,000**.\n\n**Final calculation:**\n\n- Initial liabilities = 0.00\n- Final liabilities = sum of unpaid interest receivables + unpaid purchase obligations\n\nFinal liabilities = 4950.90 (interest) + 130,000 (accounts payable) = 134,950.90\n\n**Summary:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"134950.90\"}}\n```",
