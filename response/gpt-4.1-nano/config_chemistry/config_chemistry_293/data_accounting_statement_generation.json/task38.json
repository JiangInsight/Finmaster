To align with context and previous example, the difference can be interpreted as the change in receivables balance.\n\nGiven the data and the previous solution, the net change in accounts receivable is approximately **-2,429,482.13** (meaning receivables decreased).\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-2429482.13\"}}\n```",
