Let's double-check to ensure no duplicate or overcount.\n\nFinal unpaid total identified:\n\n- Unpaid accounts payable total:  \n= 1,500,000 + 1,300,000 + 800,000 + 1,300,000 (second dataset)  \n= 4,900,000\n\nPayments made total: 5,000,000\n\n**Step 5: Final answer**\n\nThe net change (increase/decrease) in accounts payable = Payments - unpaid balance = **(âˆ’$100,000)** (a decrease).\n\nConverting to positive or negative as per convention:\n\nSince overall accounts payable decreased, the \"Increase (Decrease)\" is negative.\n\nBut generally, the \"Increase (Decrease)\" in accounts payable is reported as the net change:\n\n**Answer:** -$100,000. \n\nBut, in the initial \"solution\" format, the amount is expected to be positive or negative within quotes.\n\nSuggesting the net change as:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable'\": \"-100000.00\"}}\n```\n\n**Final step:** match the format of the original answer, which shows positive for increase and negative for decrease.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable'\": \"-100000.00\"}}\n```",
