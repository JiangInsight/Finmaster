                        "content": "Let's analyze the transactions step by step to determine the Accounts Receivable (AR) initial and final balances.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\n- The **initial AR** includes all unpaid receivables at the beginning of the period (before new sales).\n- The **final AR** includes total outstanding receivables after all transactions, including unpaid sales and any accrued interest receivables at the end of the period.\n\n### Step 2: Find the initial AR\n- From the initial transactions, the main unpaid receivable at the start is:\n  - Interest Receivable on 2023-12-31: **420.08**\n\n- No other unpaid receivables are explicitly recorded before the period starts. All initial real receivables are therefore **$420.08**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total receivables added during the period\n- By examining the \"Sale\" transactions with \"Unpaid\" status, we identify outstanding receivables:\n  - **2024-01-03** (C010): 311.75\n  - **2024-01-04** (C004): 39119.85\n  - **2024-01-08** (C002): 12657.4\n  - **2024-01-11** (C019): 67132.14\n  - **2024-01-22** (C017): 119369.05\n  - **2024-01-23** (C015): 82693.5\n  - **2024-01-24** (C014): 128615.27\n  - **2024-01-25** (C011): 134146.46\n  - **2024-01-26** (C003): 39663.3\n  - **2024-01-28** (C011): 61846.6\n  - **2024-01-29** (C012): 206035.5\n  - **2024-01-30** (C011): 57306.1\n\n- Sum of these unpaid receivables:\n  - 311.75 + 39119.85 + 12657.4 + 67132.14 + 119369.05 + 82693.5 + 128615.27 + 134146.46 + 39663.3 + 61846.6 + 206035.5 + 57306.1 = **$1,242,482.13**\n\n### Step 4: Add unpaid interest receivables at the end\n- The latest interest receivable recorded is:\n  - On 2024-01-29: **5.75**\n  - On 2024-01-30: **135.54**\n  - On 2024-01-31: (not recorded)\n  - On 2024-01-31 or later, some interest receivables are still unpaid, e.g.,  \n    - 2024-01-29: 5.75  \n    - 2024-01-30: 135.54  \n    - 2024-01-31: 190.72 (from 2024-01-31 entry with 190.72)  \n    - 2024-01-31: 164.02\n\n- Sum of unpaid interest receivables as of the latest record:\n  - 5.75 + 135.54 + 190.72 + 164.02 = **$555.03**\n\n### Step 5: Calculate total final AR\n- Final AR = sum of all unpaid sales + unpaid interest receivables\n- Final AR = **$1,242,482.13 + $555.03 = $1,243,037.16**\n\n### Step 6: Confirm the initial AR\n- The only initial unpaid receivable at opening was interest receivable: **$420.08**\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- Initial Accounts Receivable: **$420.08**\n- Final Accounts Receivable: **$1,243,037.16**\n\n### Final step: Present the answer in the specified format\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Initial Value': '420.08', 'Accounts Receivable End Value': '1243037.16'}}\n```",
