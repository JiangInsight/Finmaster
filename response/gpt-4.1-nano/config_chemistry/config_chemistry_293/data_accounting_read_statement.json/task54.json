Review the income statements:\n   - The first income statement shows a line \"Selling Expenses\" with an amount of 493,854.67.\n   - The second income statement shows \"Selling Expenses\" with an amount of 627,729.56.\n2. These expenses are incurred for activities like marketing, order processing, delivery, etc., which align with costs to secure and deliver customer orders.\n3. Among these, \"Selling Expenses\" is the most relevant cost line item, as it directly relates to securing and delivering customer orders.\n4. We confirm from typical financial statement phrasing that \"Selling Expenses\" corresponds to costs associated with selling activities, including order-related costs and delivery.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the specific line item is \"Selling Expenses.\"\n\nThe relevant value is the amount associated with this item.\n\nAnswer: 493,854.67 (from the first dataset) or 627,729.56 (from the second). Since the instruction focuses on the current data set, we'll choose the first set for consistency.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"493854.67\"}}\n```",
