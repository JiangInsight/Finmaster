Since there was no change, the contributed capital remains constant over the period.\n\nFinal answer: The initial and final value of shareholders’ contributed capital (\"Paid-in Capital\") is 13,000,000.00.\n\nTherefore, the solution in the specified JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
