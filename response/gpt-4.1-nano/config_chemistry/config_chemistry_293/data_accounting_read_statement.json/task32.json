                        "content": "Let's analyze the income statement step by step to identify the net profit after all expenses, then decompose it into five component sub-items based on related data.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the net profit after all expenses**\n\n- The net profit figure is labeled as \"Net Profit,\" which is the final bottom-line figure in the income statement.\n- The **Net Profit** given is **-1401436.89** (loss).\n\n**Step 2: Confirm the calculation basis**\n\nThe net profit is calculated as:\n\n`Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Expenses + Other Income - Other Expenses`\n\nIn this case, related line items include:\n\n- Total Revenue\n- Total Expenses\n- Financial Income (Interest Income)\n- Financial Expenses\n\nCheck the data:\n\n- Total Revenue = 7,825,951.24\n- Total Expenses = 2,551,848.96\n- Interest Income = 5,758.38\n- Financial Expenses = 543,212.45\n\nThe calculation should roughly be:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Profit before tax} = \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Total Expenses} + \\text{Interest Income} - \\text{Financial Expenses}\n\\]\n\nCompute:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit before tax} = 7,825,951.24 - 2,551,848.96 + 5,758.38 - 543,212.45\n\\]\n\nCalculations:\n\n- Revenue minus expenses: 7,825,951.24 - 2,551,848.96 = 5,274,102.28\n- Add interest income: 5,274,102.28 + 5,758.38 = 5,279,860.66\n- Subtract financial expenses: 5,279,860.66 - 543,212.45 = 4,736,648.21\n\nThe \"Profit Before Tax\" is given as **-1,010,139.34**, which conflicts with this calculation. This indicates that other expenses not shown or adjustments affect the net result, but since the explicit \"Net Profit\" is provided, it's safest to use that.\n\nThe final \"Net Profit\" is **-1401436.89**.\n\n---\n\n### Decomposition into 5 sub-items:\n\nGiven standard income statement components, we could decompose the net profit as:\n\n1. **Gross Profit**: Represents profit after deducting Cost of Goods Sold from Total Revenue.\n2. **Operating Expenses**: Sum of Administrative and Selling Expenses, including Depreciation.\n3. **Financial Income**: Interest Income.\n4. **Financial Expenses**: Financial Expenses (interest paid).\n5. **Tax Expense**: The tax paid or expense.\n\nFurther, since the profit is negative, these sub-components are primarily moving the profit from gross profit through expenses, interest income, interest expenses, and taxes to the net.\n\n---\n\n### Values:\n\n- Gross Profit = 1,535,951.24\n- Operating Expenses = Administrative Expenses + Selling Expenses + Depreciation\n  - Administrative Expenses = 1,335,153.59\n  - Selling Expenses = 627,729.56\n  - Depreciation = 45,753.36\n\nOperating Expenses total: 1,335,153.59 + 627,729.56 + 45,753.36 = 2,008,636.51\n\n- Financial Income (Interest Income) = 5,758.38\n- Financial Expenses = 543,212.45\n- Tax Expense = 391,297.55\n\n---\n\n### Final answer in specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value\": \"-1401436.89\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item1\": \"1535951.24\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item2\": \"2008636.51\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item3\": \"5758.38\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item4\": \"543212.45\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item5\": \"391297.55\"\n  }\n}\n```",
