In a balance sheet, this is typically shown under \"Retained Earnings.\"\n\nGiven data:\n- Initial value of Retained Earnings: 0.00\n- End value of Retained Earnings: -1,401,436.89\n\nSince the question asks for the specific line items and the change in the balance of profit or loss retained in the entity, the relevant figures are these two.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The initial retained earnings are zero.\n2. The final retained earnings are negative, indicating a loss retained in the company.\n3. The change in retained earnings from initial to final reflects the profit or loss retained during the period.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item is \"Retained Earnings,\" with initial and final values provided.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"-1401436.89\"}}\n```",
