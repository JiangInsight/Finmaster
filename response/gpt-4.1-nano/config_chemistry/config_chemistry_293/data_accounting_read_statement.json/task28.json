Review the provided income statement for any line item explicitly labeled as \"Tax\" or related to tax expense.\n2. The line \"Tax Expense\" is the relevant item, representing the tax amount payable during the reporting period.\n3. The value associated with \"Tax Expense\" is 391297.55.\n\nTherefore, the total tax expected to be paid is 391297.55.\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '391297.55'}}\n```",
