Examine the relevant line items under operating activities.\n2. The key line item is \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable.\"\n3. An increase in tax payable indicates taxes accrued but not yet paid â€” i.e., taxes owed but not paid in cash during the period.\n4. In the provided data, the value of this line is **391297.55**.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and value representing the increase in amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid is the line \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with a value of **391297.55**.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"391297.55\"}}\n```",
