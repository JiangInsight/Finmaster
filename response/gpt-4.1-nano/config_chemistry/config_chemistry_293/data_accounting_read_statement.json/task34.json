Based on the problem, the three identified line items match the order they appear below \"Total Revenue\" and before \"Total Expenses\".\n\n**Final extracted values:**\n\n- Total income: 7825951.24\n- Inventories sold (COGS): 6290000.00\n- Administrative expenses: 1335153.59\n\n**Answer in the specified JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '7825951.24', 'value2': '6290000.00', 'value3': '1335153.59'}}\n```",
