From the balance sheet, under liabilities, there is an entry called \"Taxes Payable,\" which indicates the amount of taxes the entity is expected to pay or recover at the reporting date.\n\n2. For the first problem:\n- In the balance sheet, \"Taxes Payable\" ends at 391,297.55.\n- The cash flow statement also shows an increase in \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" of 391,297.55.\n- The income statement lists \"Tax Expense\" as 391,297.55, which aligns with the \"Taxes Payable\" figure.\n\nIn both cases, the value for taxes payable or recoverable is 391,297.55.\n\nThus, the specific line item and value related to taxes the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period is 391,297.55.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"391297.55\"}}\n```",
