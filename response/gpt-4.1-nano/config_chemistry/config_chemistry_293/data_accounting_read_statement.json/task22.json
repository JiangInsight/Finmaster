The revenue figures are given under \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\":\n   - Main Business Revenue = 7,825,951.24\n   - Total Revenue = 7,825,951.24\n   \n   Since both are the same, the total revenue is 7,825,951.24.\n\n2. The cost figures are given under \"Cost of Goods Sold\" and \"Total Cost\":\n   - Cost of Goods Sold = 6,290,000.00\n   - Total Cost = 6,290,000.00\n\n   Both are the same, so total cost is 6,290,000.00.\n\n3. The difference between total revenue and total cost:\n   - 7,825,951.24 - 6,290,000.00 = 1,535,951.24\n\n4. This difference is shown as \"Gross Profit,\" which confirms the calculation:\n   - Gross Profit = 1,535,951.24\n\nTherefore, the specific line item is \"Gross Profit,\" with a value of 1,535,951.24.\n\nAnswer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1535951.24'} }\n```",
