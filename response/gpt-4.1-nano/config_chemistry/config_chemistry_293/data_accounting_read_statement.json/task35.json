The first item to find is \"costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers.\" These are typically categorized as \"Selling Expenses\" in an income statement.\n\n2. The second item is \"financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation.\" This corresponds to \"Financial Expenses.\"\n\n3. The third item is \"the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.\" This is \"Depreciation.\"\n\n4. The fourth item is \"total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period,\" which is labeled as \"Tax Expense.\"\n\nNow, extracting these from the given data:\n\n- Selling Expenses: 627729.56\n- Financial Expenses: 543212.45\n- Depreciation: 45753.36\n- Tax Expense: 391297.55\n\nLet's compile the JSON solution accordingly:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"627729.56\", \"value2\": \"45753.36\", \"value3\": \"543212.45\", \"value4\": \"391297.55\"}}\n```",
