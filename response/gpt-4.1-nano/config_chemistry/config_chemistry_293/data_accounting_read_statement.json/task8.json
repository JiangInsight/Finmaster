We are looking for line items that represent amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit.\n\n2. Typically, such items are categorized under \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable,\" which fall under liabilities.\n\n3. From the table:\n   - The initial value of \"Accounts Payable\" is 0.00.\n   - The end value of \"Accounts Payable\" is 2,100,000.00.\n\n4. Since the initial value was zero and increased to a positive amount, this indicates the entity has accrued new amounts owed for credit purchases.\n\n5. \"Taxes Payable\" also increased from 0.00 to 391,297.55, which can represent taxes owed but are not necessarily related to goods/services received on creditâ€”they are taxes.\n\n6. The primary amount owed for goods or services on credit is \"Accounts Payable,\" as it directly relates to trade credit liabilities.\n\n7. Therefore, the relevant line items are \"Accounts Payable,\" with initial and final values as identified.\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"2100000.00\"}}\n```",
