The task is to identify and extract the line items and values of total assets that are **not expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle**. This generally refers to **non-current assets** that are not expected to be quickly converted to cash or used up within the operating cycle.\n\n2. From the provided data, the relevant line items are:\n   - **Fixed Assets** (and its associated *Accumulated Depreciation*), which are long-term assets used in operations.\n   - **Total Non-current Assets**, which aggregates fixed assets and potentially other long-term assets.\n\n3. Let's look at the **initial and end values** of total non-current assets:\n   - Initial Total Non-current Assets: 5,000,000.00\n   - End Total Non-current Assets: 5,278,924.21\n\n4. These figures are consistent with the description of assets that are not intended for sale in the normal operating cycle but are used in the business operations over the long term.\n\n**Therefore, the specific line items and values are:**\n\n**Initial value:** 5,000,000.00  \n**End value:** 5,278,924.21  \n\n---\n\n**Final answer in the required JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5278924.21'} }\n```",
