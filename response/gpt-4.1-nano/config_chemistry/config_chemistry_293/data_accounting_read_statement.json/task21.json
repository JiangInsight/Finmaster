Typically, this includes \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\" since they reflect income generated from core activities.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The \"Main Business Revenue\" explicitly indicates income from core operations.\n2. The \"Total Revenue\" often includes all income sources, including non-operating items, but generally reflects total income from core and non-core activities.\n3. To accurately identify core operating income, the \"Main Business Revenue\" is the most direct and relevant figure.\n4. \"Total Revenue\" can be used if \"Main Business Revenue\" is not explicitly provided, but here both are given, with \"Main Business Revenue\" being more precise.\n\nThus, the specific line item and value representing core operating income is \"Main Business Revenue\" with the amount 7825951.24.\n\nAnswer in the required json format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '7825951.24'}}\n```",
