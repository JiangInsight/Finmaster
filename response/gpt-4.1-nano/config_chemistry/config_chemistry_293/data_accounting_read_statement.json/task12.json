                        "content": "To find the line items of total assets expected to be realised or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle, we look at current assets, including cash, bank deposits, interest receivable, accounts receivable, and inventory. These items are generally expected to be liquidated, sold, or consumed within the operating cycle.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify current assets at initial and end dates:\n   - Cash on Hand\n   - Bank Deposits\n   - Interest Receivable\n   - Accounts Receivable\n   - Inventory\n\n2. Sum their initial and end values to get the total current assets at both points:\n   - Initial total current assets = 8,000,000.00 (given)\n   - End total current assets = 8,810,936.45 (from data)\n\n3. These totals reflect the amounts of assets expected to be realised or used in the operating cycle, including initial and final values.\n\nTherefore, the line items relevant are the current assets, and their initial and final totals are as shown.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '8810936.45'}}\n```",
