However, assets held for sale are typically categorized separately, often as \"Assets Held for Sale\" or similar line items.\n\n- The statement does not explicitly mention \"Assets Held for Sale\".\n\n- The \"Decrease in Inventory\" indicates a reduction in inventory assets during the period, which may include assets held for sale.\n\nGiven that inventory reduction is often associated with assets that might be held for sale, and no other specific line item mentions assets held for sale separately, the most relevant figure pointing towards reduction is the \"Decrease in Inventory\".\n\n**Therefore, the specific line item and amount associated with asset reduction related to assets held for sale during the period are:**\n\n- Line item: \"Decrease in Inventory\"\n- Amount: -3540000.00\n\n**Final answer in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-3540000.00\"}}\n```",
