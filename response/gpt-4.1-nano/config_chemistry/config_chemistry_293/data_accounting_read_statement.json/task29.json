In an income statement, **Total Revenue** or **Main Business Revenue** typically represents the total income from ordinary activities.\n2. Here, **Total Revenue** is explicitly listed and matches **Main Business Revenue**.\n\nNext, the problem asks us to decompose this total income into one component sub-item from the input statement.\n\n3. Usually, **Revenue** can be broken down into **Main Business Revenue**, **Interest Income**, or similar items. \n4. The most common primary component of total income from core operations is **Main Business Revenue**.\n\nSince **Total Revenue** equals **Main Business Revenue**, and interest income is usually considered other income rather than part of core operating income, the primary component sub-item should be **Main Business Revenue**.\n\nNow, the values:\n\n- Total Revenue: 7,825,951.24\n- Main Business Revenue: 7,825,951.24\n\nThe sub-item:\n\n- Name: Main Business Revenue\n- Value (initial): 7,825,951.24\n- Final value: same as initial, since no changes or additional info suggest otherwise.\n\n**FinalSteps**:\n\nConstruct the JSON as required.\n\nAnswer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"7825951.24\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value\": \"7825951.24\"}}}\n```",
