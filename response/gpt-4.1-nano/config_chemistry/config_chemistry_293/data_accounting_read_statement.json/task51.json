                        "content": "To identify and extract the amounts of interest accrued but not yet received, including initial and final values, I need to analyze the financial statements provided, focusing on the line item related to interest receivable or interest income.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Look for line items named \"Interest Receivable,\" \"Interest Income,\" or similar.\n\n2. In the balance sheet, \"Interest Receivable\" is explicitly listed, with initial and end amounts.\n\n3. The initial amount of \"Interest Receivable\" is 0.00, indicating no accrued interest at the beginning of the period.\n\n4. The end amount of \"Interest Receivable\" is 5758.38, representing accrued interest not yet received as of the end date.\n\n5. Since the question asks for the specific line item and its value of amounts interest accrued but not yet received, I focus on the \"Interest Receivable\" account.\n\n6. Initial value: 0.00\n\n7. Final value: 5758.38\n\nTherefore, the answer is the \"Interest Receivable\" line item with initial 0.00 and final 5758.38.\n\nFormatted in the required JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '5758.38'}}\n```",
