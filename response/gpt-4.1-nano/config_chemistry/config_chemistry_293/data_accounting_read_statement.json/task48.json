The amount of profit an entity retains after all expenses (i.e., \"net profit\").  \n2. The amount spent on acquiring property, plant, and equipment, which is represented by \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nFrom the provided data:\n\n1. The line labeled \"Net Profit\" has a value of -1,401,436.89.  \n2. The line labeled \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" has a value of 324,677.57.\n\nThese match the description:  \n- Net profit (profit after expenses) is given explicitly as \"Net Profit.\"  \n- Capital expenditure on property, plant, and equipment is given as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nOrder preservation:  \n- First, the \"Net Profit\" value.  \n- Second, the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" value.\n\nFinal values:  \n- Value1: -1,401,436.89  \n- Value2: 324,677.57\n\nPutting it into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '-1401436.89', 'value2': '324677.57'} }\n```",
