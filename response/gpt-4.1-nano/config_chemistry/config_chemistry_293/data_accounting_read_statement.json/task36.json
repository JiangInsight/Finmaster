In financial statements, this is typically represented by the Net Profit or Net Income line item.\n\nFrom the provided cash flow statement, the key line to identify is \"Net Profit.\"\n\n- The \"Net Profit\" for the period is listed as -1,401,436.89.\n- Although negative, this figure represents the profit (loss) after all expenses have been deducted.\n\nSince the problem asks for the amount of profit an entity retains after all expenses, that is precisely what the \"Net Profit\" figure conveys.\n\nTherefore, the amount of profit retained (considering it may be negative, indicating a net loss) is **-1,401,436.89**.\n\nNow, formatting this as required:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1401436.89'} }\n```",
