Look at the 'Accounts Payable' line item:\n   - Initial amount (2023-12-31): 0.00\n   - End amount (2024-01-30): 2,100,000.00\n\n2. The increase (or addition) in accounts payable is:\n   - End amount - Initial amount = 2,100,000.00 - 0.00 = 2,100,000.00\n\n3. This indicates that during the period, the entity increased its liabilities for goods or services received on credit by 2,100,000.00.\n\n4. Cross-reference with the cash flow statement:\n   - \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": 2,100,000.00, which confirms the increase.\n\nHence, the specific line item is \"Accounts Payable\" with an addition of 2,100,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"2100000.00\"}}\n```",
