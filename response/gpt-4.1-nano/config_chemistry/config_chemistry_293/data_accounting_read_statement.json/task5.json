Look at the \"Inventory\" line items:\n   - In the first scenario, Inventory initial: 0.00, final: 5,090,000.00\n   - In the second scenario, Inventory initial: 0.00, final: 3,540,000.00\n\n2. Since inventories can include goods in production or ready for sale, and because the problem asks for assets held for sale or in production for the sale, the Inventory line is the primary candidate.\n\n3. The initial value for inventory (assets in process of sale or sale-ready) is zero in both cases, indicating that there were no assets classified as such at the start.\n\n4. The final inventory values are:\n   - First scenario: 5,090,000.00\n   - Second scenario: 3,540,000.00\n\nThese values reflect the assets held for sale or in production for such sale at the end of the period.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- For the first problem, the initial value is 0.00, and the end value is 5,090,000.00.\n- For the second problem, the initial value is 0.00, and the end value is 3,540,000.00.\n\n**Final answer in the required JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"5090000.00\"}}\n```",
