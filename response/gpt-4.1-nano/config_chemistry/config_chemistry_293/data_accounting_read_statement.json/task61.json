Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers.\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify costs to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services\n\n- Commonly, such costs are reflected in expenses associated with sales and administrative functions.\n- From the income statement, typical relevant expenses include:  \n  - Selling Expenses (costs related to securing customer orders and delivering goods/services)\n  - Administrative Expenses (costs related to administration and support functions)\n\n- Since the explicit line item for \"costs to secure customer orders\" and \"costs to deliver goods and services\" isn't directly named, the closest relevant line is **Selling Expenses** (for securing orders/delivering services) and possibly **Administrative Expenses**.\n\n**In the provided examples:**  \n  - The first example identified '493854.67' (Selling Expenses) as costs to secure and deliver.\n  - The second example picked '627729.56' (Selling Expenses).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- The specific line item for costs to secure/ deliver is **Selling Expenses** in the income statement.\n\n### Step 2: Identify cash payments to acquire property, plant, and other long-term assets\n\n- Such payments are reflected in the cash flow statement under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" specifically called \"**Purchase of Fixed Assets**.\"\n\n**In the provided examples:**  \n  - The first example identified '305354.43' as the purchase of fixed assets.\n  - The second example identified '324677.57'.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- The line item is **Purchase of Fixed Assets** in cash flow statement.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the steps above:\n\n- Costs to secure customer orders and to deliver goods/services = Selling Expenses (Income Statement)\n- Cash payments for property, plant, equipment and long-term assets = Purchase of Fixed Assets (Cash Flow Statement)\n\n---\n\n### Presenting the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"493854.67\", \"value2\": \"305354.43\"}}\n```\n\nNote: These values are from the first provided input's respective line items in the income statement and cash flow statement, matching the pattern observed in the example.",
