Look at the accounts that typically represent cash or cash equivalents:\n   - **Cash on Hand**: directly represents physical cash available.\n   - **Bank Deposits**: represent cash held in bank accounts.\n   \n2. Summing these two accounts gives us the total cash that is readily available for operational use.\n\n3. For the initial value:\n   - Cash on Hand: 3,000,000.00\n   - Bank Deposits: 5,000,000.00\n   - Total initial cash = 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 8,000,000.00\n\n4. For the end value:\n   - Cash on Hand: 1,753,673.43\n   - Bank Deposits: 1,522,888.62\n   - Total end cash = 1,753,673.43 + 1,522,888.62 = 3,276,562.05\n\n5. The other accounts like Interest Receivable or Accounts Receivable are not considered cash equivalents; they are receivables, not cash on hand.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"3276562.05\"}}\n```",
