The closest matching line is **\" (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\"** — but note the wording “reduction in the amount of assets held for sale,” which likely corresponds to **decrease in inventory**.  \n   - The value given is **-3540000.00** (a decrease, which is a reduction).\n\n3. **Third Line Item:**  \n   - *\"net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends\"*  \n   - This refers to cash flows related to investments (acquisition or sale of assets, investments, and receipt of interest/dividends).  \n   - From the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" net cash flow is **-324677.57**, which aligns with investment activities including asset purchases/disposals and interest/dividends.\n\n4. **Fourth Line Item:**  \n   - *\"net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\"*  \n   - This is typically **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**, which is **-4723437.95**.\n\n**Summary of the four extracted items in order:**\n\n- Depreciation: 45753.36\n- Reduction in assets held for sale/inventory: -3540000.00\n- Cash generated from asset acquisitions/disposals, investments, interest, dividends: -324677.57\n- Net increase/decrease in cash and cash equivalents: -4723437.95\n\nNow, presenting in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"45753.36\", \"value2\": \"-3540000.00\", \"value3\": \"-324677.57\", \"value4\": \"-4723437.95\"}}\n```",
