Check initial and end amounts for \"Bank Deposits\":\n   - Initial amount: 15,000,000.00\n   - End amount: 1,103,978.40\n3. The problem specifies to find the *funds deposited into a bank*, including initial and final values.\n4. We also need to determine whether other accounts reflect funds that ultimately relate to bank deposits:\n   - \"Cash on Hand\": initial 5,000,000.00, end 3,041,599.18\n   - \"Accounts Receivable\" and \"Inventory\" have large amounts, but these are assets, not directly deposits.\n5. Based on the problem context, the primary account of interest is \"Bank Deposits.\"\n6. The initial value of funds deposited into the bank is 15,000,000.00.\n7. The final value of funds deposited into the bank is 1,103,978.40.\n\nHence, the key line items are \"Bank Deposits\" with their corresponding initial and end amounts.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"15000000.00\", \"end value\": \"1103978.40\"}}\n```",
