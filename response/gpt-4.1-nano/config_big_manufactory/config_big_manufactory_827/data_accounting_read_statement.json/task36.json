The question asks for the amount of profit an entity retains after all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, have been deducted from total revenue. Essentially, this is the net profit (also called net income).\n\n2. From the data, the relevant line item appears to be \"Net Profit,\" which is explicitly listed in the table.\n\n3. The \"Net Profit\" value is 1,250,911.98.\n\n4. Since this line reports the profit after all expenses, it matches exactly what we are asked to find.\n\n**Therefore, the answer is the value listed in \"Net Profit\".**\n\nFinal answer: 1250911.98\n\nNow, I'll format this in the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1250911.98'}}\n```",
