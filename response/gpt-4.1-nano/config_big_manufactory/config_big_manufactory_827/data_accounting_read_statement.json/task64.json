Identify and extract three specific line items and their end values:**\n\na) The profit or loss before tax (gross profit or profit before tax) from all statements.\nb) The addition to the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit (accounts payable increase/decrease).\nc) The capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares (paid-in capital).\n\n---\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n\n- The total equity at end of the period includes \"Paid-in Capital\" and \"Retained Earnings\". \n- The \"Paid-in Capital\" is the capital contributed by shareholders.\n- From the balance sheet data, \"Paid-in Capital\" at end is **28000000.00**.\n\n**Income Statement:**\n\n- Profit before tax at the end of the period: **2154033.87** (Net profit before tax is a key line).\n- The line \"Profit Before Tax\" is **2154033.87**.\n\n**Cash Flow Statement:**\n\n- The increase in accounts payable (credit for goods/services): **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable** is **1000000.00**.\n- The profit before tax from the cash flow statement matches the income statement: **1250911.98** (Net profit, but the task asks for profit/loss before tax, so use the \"Profit Before Tax\" from income statement).\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The problem asks for the \"profit or loss before tax\", so from the income statement, it is **2154033.87**.\n\n---\n\n### Final selections:\n\n- Profit or loss before tax: **2154033.87** (from income statement)\n- Increase in amount owed (accounts payable): **1000000.00**\n- Capital contributed by shareholders (paid-in capital): **28000000.00**\n\n---\n\n## Final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"2154033.87\", \"value2\": \"1000000.00\", \"value3\": \"28000000.00\"}}\n```",
