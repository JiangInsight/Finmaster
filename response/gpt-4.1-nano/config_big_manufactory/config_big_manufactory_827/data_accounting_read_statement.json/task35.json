Costs to secure and deliver: **Selling Expenses** = 1,468,071.54\n2. Financing costs: **Financial Expenses** = 351,260.94\n3. Depreciation: **Depreciation** = 138,957.79\n4. Taxes: **Tax Expense** = 903,121.89\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1468071.54', 'value2': '351260.94', 'value3': '138957.79', 'value4': '903121.89'}}\n```",
