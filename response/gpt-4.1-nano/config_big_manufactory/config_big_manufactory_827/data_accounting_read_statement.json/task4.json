This is typically recorded under \"Interest Receivable\" on the balance sheet.\n\n2. Examine the \"Interest Receivable\" line item for initial and end amounts:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n   - End_amount: 13555.89 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n3. Since the initial amount is zero, and the end amount is positive, the interest accrued but not yet received during this period is 13,555.89.\n\n4. The line item is specifically \"Interest Receivable.\"\n\nTherefore, the initial value of interest accrued but not received is 0.00, and the final value is 13,555.89.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"13555.89\"}}\n```",
