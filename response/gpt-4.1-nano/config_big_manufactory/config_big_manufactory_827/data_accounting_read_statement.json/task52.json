In a balance sheet, this is typically labeled as \"Paid-in Capital\" (or similar, such as \"Share Capital\").\n\nFrom the provided data:\n- Initial value of Paid-in Capital: 28,000,000.00 (on 2023-12-31)\n- End value of Paid-in Capital: 28,000,000.00 (on 2024-02-05)\n\nThis indicates that the shareholders' contribution (initial and final) remained the same and was not increased or decreased during this period.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item is \"Paid-in Capital\", with both initial and final values being 28,000,000.00.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"28000000.00\", \"end value\": \"28000000.00\"}}\n```",
