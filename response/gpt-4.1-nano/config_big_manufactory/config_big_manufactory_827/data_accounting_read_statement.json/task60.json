The end value of funds deposited into a bank, which is reflected in balance sheet accounts related to bank deposits or cash equivalents.\n2. The income earned by the entity from financial assets, which is represented as interest income in the income statement.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Identify the line item for funds deposited into a bank (end value)**\n\nIn the balance sheet, the relevant accounts are:\n\n- \"Bank Deposits\" (which represents funds deposited in the bank)\n- \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" (if applicable, but not explicitly listed as a specific account here)\n  \nThe most direct indicator is the \"Bank Deposits\" account, showing the amount at the end date.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet:\n\n- **\"Bank Deposits\" End_amount:** 1,103,978.40\n\nThis is the value of funds deposited into the bank at the end date.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify the income earned from financial assets**\n\nIn the income statement, the interest income is:\n\n- **\"Interest Income\"**: 13,555.89\n\nThis is the income earned from financial assets (interest on deposits, investments, etc.).\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Confirm the two values**\n\n- Funds deposited into a bank (end value): **1,103,978.40**\n- Income from financial assets: **13,555.89**\n\n---\n\n**Final answer formatting:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"1103978.40\", \"value2\": \"13555.89\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"1103978.40\", \"value2\": \"13555.89\"}}\n```",
