The amount of profit an entity retains after all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, have been deducted from total revenue. This is essentially the net profit (or net income).\n\n  2. The amount spent on property, plant, and equipment, and other long-term assets. This is usually seen as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in cash flow statements, which is a cash outflow.\n\n- The problem states these are the two specific line items, in order, as shown in the input.\n\nStep 2: Identify these two line items and their values.\n\n- First line item: Net Profit (or net income) â€“ straightforward; it's explicitly labeled \"Net Profit\" in the data.\n\n  From the data:\n  \"Net Profit  | 1250911.98\"\n\n- Second line item: Cash payments for property, plant, and equipment (PPE), which is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n\n  From the data:\n  \"Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 2496021.60\"\n\nStep 3: Confirm that these are the correct items to extract.\n\n- The first item aligns with the description: profit retained after deductions (net profit).\n- The second item aligns with the description: cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment.\n\nStep 4: Present the answer maintaining the original line order and in the specified JSON format.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"1250911.98\", \"value2\": \"2496021.60\"}}\n```",
