                        "content": "To find the specific line item related to the reduction in assets held for sale, we need to review the cash flow statement carefully, focusing on line items that indicate a decrease in assets that are classified as held for sale, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured.\n\nIn cash flow statements, reductions or disposals of assets held for sale are usually reflected under investing activities, often as \"Sale of assets\" or similar terminology, or sometimes as decreasing line items related to assets.\n\nLet's analyze the provided data:\n\n1. The statement shows the following relevant lines:\n\n- \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" and related net profit, depreciation, and changes in working capital.\n- \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" which includes \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an outflow (-2496021.60) and a net cash flow from investing activities (-2496021.60).\n\n2. There is no explicit line mentioning \"Sale of assets\" or \"Disposal of assets\" or similar. Also, the negative change in inventory (-6100000.00) relates to inventory changes, not assets held for sale.\n\n3. Since the question specifically pertains to reduction in assets held for sale (and similar assets), the relevant entry should show a decrease in such assets.\n\n4. However, in the provided data, there is no direct line item indicating the sale or disposal of assets held for sale.\n\n5. Given only these entries, the most relevant reduction in assets held for sale (if it existed) would typically be reflected as a note or a sale, which isn't explicitly listed.\n\nConclusion:\n\nSince the data doesn't explicitly mention sale or reduction of assets held for sale, the line item that indicates asset reduction would be the decrease in inventory if inventory is considered as assets held for sale, especially if they are in process of being manufactured or in sale process.\n\nThe decrease in inventory is -6,100,000.00, which seems substantial and related to assets in production or inventory for sale.\n\nHowever, the problem specifically asks for \"assets held for sale\" in the context of cash flow statement, and based on the data provided, the only relevant line indicating a reduction in assets (possible inventory assets or assets in process) is:\n\n**\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with value -6,100,000.00**\n\nTherefore, the answer in this context is:\n\n{\"value\": \"-6100000.00\"}\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-6100000.00\"}}\n```",
