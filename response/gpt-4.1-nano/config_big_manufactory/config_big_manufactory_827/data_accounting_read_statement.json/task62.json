Identify the three specific line items:**\n\n- Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit:  \n  This typically corresponds to **Accounts Receivable**.\n\n- Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation:  \n  This is represented by **Financial Expenses**.\n\n- Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets:  \n  This is represented by **Purchase of Fixed Assets**.\n\n---\n\n**2. Extract the end amounts (values at the end date) of these line items from the provided data:**\n\n- Accounts Receivable (balance sheet, end amount): **10537836.59**\n\n- Financial Expenses (income statement, note this is an expense, not a cash outflow, but the purchase of property and equipment is on the cash flow statement):  \n  *Note:* In the cash flow statement, cash payments for property, plant, and equipment are given directly under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": **2496021.60**\n\n- Purchases of fixed assets (cash flow statement): **2496021.60**\n\n---\n\n**3. Final data to include in output:**\n\n- Value 1 (amounts owed for goods/services provided on credit): **10537836.59**\n\n- Value 2 (financing costs to raise funds): **351260.94** (from the income statement, Financial Expenses)\n\n- Value 3 (cash payments for PPE and long-term assets): **2496021.60** (from cash flow statement)\n\n---\n\n**4. Maintain the order as specified:**\n\nOrder: Balance Sheet (accounts receivable), Income Statement (financing costs), Cash Flow Statement (property and equipment payments).\n\n---\n\n**Final answer in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"10537836.59\", \"value2\": \"351260.94\", \"value3\": \"2496021.60\"}}\n```",
