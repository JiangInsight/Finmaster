Common line items that often qualify include \"Assets held for sale,\" \"Assets in production,\" \"Assets in process,\" or similar terminology.\n\nIn the provided balance sheet data, relevant line items to consider are \"Inventory,\" \"Fixed Assets,\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" among others. Since the question asks for assets held for sale specifically in the context of initial and final values, and the data points over time are available, we look for values related to inventory or assets specifically designated as held for sale.\n\nFrom the data:\n- \"Inventory\" increased from 0.00 to 6,100,000.00\n- \"Fixed Assets\" increased from 8,000,000.00 to 10,496,021.60\n- \"Accumulated Depreciation\" increased but is generally a contra-asset account and not counted as an asset itself for held-for-sale purposes.\n\nGiven the common conventions, the **\"Inventory\"** line item likely reflects assets in production for sale or assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business.\n\n**Initial value of Inventory:** 0.00  \n**Final value of Inventory:** 6,100,000.00\n\n**Note:** Without explicit labels, the most appropriate line item matching the criteria is \"Inventory.\" Fixed assets might be included if they were specifically allocated as held for sale; since their value increased, but unless explicitly marked as such, inventory is the most straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"6100000.00\"}}\n```",
