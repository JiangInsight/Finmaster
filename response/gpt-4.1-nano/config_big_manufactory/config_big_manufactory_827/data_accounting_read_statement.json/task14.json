Typically, current liabilities include accounts payable, taxes payable, and other short-term obligations.\n\nStep 1: Identify current liabilities from the given data.\n- Accounts Payable: End amount = 1,000,000.00\n- Taxes Payable: End amount = 903,121.89\n\nStep 2: Sum these liabilities to get the total liabilities expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle.\n- Initial values are zeros, so focusing on the end values:\n  - Total current liabilities = 1,000,000.00 + 903,121.89 = 1,903,121.89\n\nStep 3: Verify if there are other liabilities listed that are short-term and relevant.\n- The table includes only the above liabilities as current liabilities; other liabilities are either not listed or are long-term, not expected to settle in the normal operating cycle.\n\nFinal step: Present the values.\n\nAnswer:\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1903121.89'} }",
