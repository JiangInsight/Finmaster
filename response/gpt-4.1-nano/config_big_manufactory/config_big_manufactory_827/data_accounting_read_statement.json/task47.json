We also need to decompose this into two sub-items from the input data.\n\nStep 1: Locate the line item \"Net Increase\" in the input table.\n- \"Net Increase\" = -15854422.42\n\nStep 2: Determine the sub-items that sum up to this net increase.\n- The typical source for change in cash involves:\n  1. Beginning Balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents\n  2. Ending Balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nFrom the data:\n- Beginning Balance = 20000000.00\n- Ending Balance = 4145577.58\n\nNote: The change in cash is the difference between ending and beginning balances:\n- Final change = Ending Balance - Beginning Balance = 4145577.58 - 20000000.00 = -15854422.42\n\nThis matches the \"Net Increase\" value, confirming that the net cash change equals the difference of these two sub-items.\n\nTherefore, the two sub-items are the Beginning Balance and Ending Balance.\n\nFinal answer:  \n- Total net addition in cash = -15854422.42  \n- Sub-item 1 (Beginning Balance): 20000000.00  \n- Sub-item 2 (Ending Balance): 4145577.58\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value\": \"-15854422.42\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value1\": \"20000000.00\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value2\": \"4145577.58\"\n  }\n}\n```",
