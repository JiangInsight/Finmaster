Since the net cash flow from investing activities is provided, we can consider that as the net amount generated/used from such activities.  \n   - The **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities** line fits this description.\n\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**  \n   - This is **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**.\n\n---\n\n### Extracted values:\n\n- **Value 1** (Depreciation): From line: **138,957.79**\n- **Value 2** (Assets held for sale reduction / inventory reduction): From line: **-6,100,000.00**\n- **Value 3** (Net cash from activities related to assets and investments): From line: **-2,496,021.60** (Net cash flow from investing activities)\n- **Value 4** (Net increase in cash and cash equivalents): From line: **-15,854,422.42**\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '138957.79', 'value2': '-6100000.00', 'value3': '-2496021.60', 'value4': '-15854422.42'}}\n```",
