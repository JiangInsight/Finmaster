The change in \"Accounts Payable\" from the initial to the end date indicates the addition of credit purchases.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Initial value of Accounts Payable: 0.00\n2. End value of Accounts Payable: 1,000,000.00\n3. The increase (or addition) in Accounts Payable = End value - Initial value = 1,000,000.00 - 0.00 = 1,000,000.00\n\nThis means the entityâ€™s amount owed for goods or services received on credit increased by 1,000,000.00 during the period.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1000000.00'} }\n```",
