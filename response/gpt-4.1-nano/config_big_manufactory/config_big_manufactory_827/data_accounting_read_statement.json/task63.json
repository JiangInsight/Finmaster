The principal revenue-producing activities of the entity and other activities that are not investing or financing activities:**\n\n- From the income statement, the main revenue figure is \"Main Business Revenue\" which indicates the primary revenue stream.\n- The cash flow statement's \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" represents cash generated from operational activities, which includes revenue-related cash flows.\n- The balance sheet does not directly show the revenue but contains assets and liabilities related to core operations.\n\n**Key line item:**\n\n- Income Statement: \"Main Business Revenue\" (or \"Total Revenue\", same as main revenue for most entities).\n- Cash Flow Statement: \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities.\"\n- Balance Sheet: The cash and cash equivalents do not directly show revenue, but cash flow from operating activities is the associated cash measure.\n\n---\n\n**2. The amounts of taxes accrued but not yet paid:**\n\n- From the balance sheet under \"Taxes Payable,\" which reflects taxes accrued but unpaid.\n  \n**Value:** The \"Taxes Payable\" at end date.\n\n**3. Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities:**\n\n- Typically, this is \"Net Profit\" or \"Net Income\" figure from the income statement, representing profit after all expenses, taxes, and revenues.\n\n---\n\n### Final extraction based on the data:\n\n- **Line item 1 (from income statement / cash flow):** Main Business Revenue / Net Cash from Operating Activities\n- **Line item 2 (from balance sheet):** Taxes Payable\n- **Line item 3 (from income statement):** Net Profit\n\n### Corresponding values:\n\n- **value1:** Taxes Payable = 903121.89\n- **value2:** Main Business Revenue = 18062437.45 (or Total Revenue, same value)\n- **value3:** Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -13358400.82\n\n---\n\n### Final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '903121.89', 'value2': '18062437.45', 'value3': '-13358400.82'}}\n```",
