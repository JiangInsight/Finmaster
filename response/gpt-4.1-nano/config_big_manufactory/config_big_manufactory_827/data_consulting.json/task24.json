                        "content": "Let's analyze the given data step-by-step to compute the required ratios:\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\nThis ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets financed through debt. \n\n**Formula:**\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Liabilities** (Major liabilities include Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable, since no other liabilities are specified):\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Liabilities} = 1,003,000 \\text{ (Accounts Payable)} + 903,121.89 \\text{ (Taxes Payable)} = 1,906,121.89\n  \\]\n- **Total Assets**:\n  \\[\n  31,154,033.87\n  \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{1,906,121.89}{31,154,033.87} \\approx 0.0612\n\\]\n\nExpressed as a ratio: approximately **0.06** or **6.12%**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Net Cash Ratio\nThis ratio indicates the company's liquidity position by comparing cash and cash equivalents to current liabilities:\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[\n\\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the cash flow and balance sheet:\n- **Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n  \\[\n  Beginning Cash + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable + Inventory = \\text{End balances}\n  \\]\n  But the cash flow statement indicates:\n  - Beginning balance (Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable + Inventory): \\(5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20,000,000\\)\n  - The ending cash and equivalents (from cash flow): \\$4,145,577.58.\n\n  For simplicity, considering the cash and cash equivalents as directly given in the balance sheet as Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable:\n  \\[\n  3,041,599.18 + 1,103,978.40 + 13,555.89 + 10,537,836.59 = 15,696,970.06\n  \\]\n  \n- **Total Current Liabilities**:\n  \\[\n  1,903,121.89\n  \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{15,696,970.06}{1,903,121.89} \\approx 8.25\n\\]\n\nThis indicates the company holds roughly 8.25 times its current liabilities in cash and cash equivalents, signifying strong liquidity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.06\",\n    \"Net Cash Ratio\": \"8.25\"\n  }\n}\n```",
