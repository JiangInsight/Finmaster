                        "content": "Let's carefully analyze and calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio for the given data.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the required components**\n\n- **Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: This is provided in the cash flow statement.\n- **Total Debt (Liabilities)**: Typically, this includes current liabilities (short-term debt) and non-current liabilities. In the balance sheet, we observe:\n  - Current Liabilities (Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable): 1,903,121.89\n  - Plus, we need to consider any long-term liabilities if available. However, the data only explicitly mentions current liabilities, and no long-term liabilities are provided. For the sake of this calculation, we will assume total debt equals the total liabilities, which is the sum of current liabilities (since no non-current liabilities are explicitly stated).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Total Debt**\n\n- Total Liabilities = 1,903,121.89 (current liabilities) + 0 (non-current liabilities not provided)\n- Total Debt â‰ˆ 1,903,121.89\n\n**Step 3: Use the cash flow from operating activities**\n\n- Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -13,358,400.82 (negative indicating outflow)\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-13,358,400.82}{1,903,121.89} \\approx -7.02\n\\]\n\nThis ratio indicates that the operating cash flow is about 7 times the total debt but is negative, meaning the company is experiencing outflows greater than its current debt level.\n\n**Step 5: Format the result**\n\nRound to two decimal places, and represent negative ratio clearly.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-7.02\"}}\n```",
