Here, the negative indicates a significant outflow.\n\n**Final step:** Present the answer rounded suitably, say to two decimal places.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Ratio': '-66.79'}}\n```\n\n**Note:** If the required is in decimal form, use '-0.67'; if percentage, '-66.79%'. The previous example suggests a numeric ratio, so the value '-66.79' is appropriate.",
