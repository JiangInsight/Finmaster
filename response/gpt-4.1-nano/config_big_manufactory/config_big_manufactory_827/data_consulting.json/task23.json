As non-current liabilities are not explicitly provided, we consider only current liabilities as total debt for this calculation.\n\n- Total debt = 1,903,121.89\n\n- Next, determine the net cash flow from operating activities.\n\nFrom cash flow statement:\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -13,358,400.82\n\n- The Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-13,358,400.82}{1,903,121.89} \\approx -7.03\n\\]\n\nExpressed as a ratio, approximately -7.03.\n\n**Final Formatting:**\n\n- Gross Profit Margin: \"27.48%\"\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: \"-7.03\"\n\n---\n\n### Final answer in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Gross Profit Margin\": \"27.48%\", \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-7.03\"}}\n```",
