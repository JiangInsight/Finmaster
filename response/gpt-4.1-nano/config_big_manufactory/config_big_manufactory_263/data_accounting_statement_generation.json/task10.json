Since the initial fixed assets are 8,000,000, and additional property/properties are added, plus the latest fixed asset purchase.\n\nTo keep consistent with standard practice, the total non-current asset at the end appears to be:\n\n- Initial: 8,000,000\n- Add: sum of new fixed asset purchases:\n  305,354.43 (latest fixed asset)\n  + 2,000,000 (latest heavy equipment C)\n  + 1,500,000 (heavy equipment D)\n  + 1,000,000 (heavy equipment B)\n  + 800,000 (heavy equipment B)\n  + 500,000 (heavy equipment A)\n  + 800,000 (heavy equipment B)\n  + 1,600,000 (heavy equipment C)\n  + 1,000,000 (heavy equipment C)\n  + 1,500,000 (heavy equipment D)\n  + 800,000 (heavy equipment C)\n  + 2,000,000 (heavy equipment C)\n  \nSummed purchases (excluding initial fixed): approximately 13,805,354.43\n\nAdding depreciation (~45750 per property asset line, total ~500,000-600,000), net value of assets at the end:\n≈ 8,000,000 + 13,805,354.43 - 600,000 ≈ 21,205,354.43\n\nBut the question likely expects a direct sum of assets: initial fixed asset value plus all purchase values minus depreciation.\n\nGiven the provided data and typical accounting practice, the most consistent answer is:\n\n- Initial: 8,000,000.00\n- Final total (including depreciation): approximately 5,259,603.02 (from the second set)\n\nThus, for consistency with the provided data, and noting the last value is about 5.26 million, which aligns with the final property value after depreciation.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '5259603.02'}}\n```",
