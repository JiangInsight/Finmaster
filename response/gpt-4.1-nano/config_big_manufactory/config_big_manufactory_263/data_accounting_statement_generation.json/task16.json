                        "content": "Let's analyze the data step-by-step to determine the paid-in capital amounts.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all transactions related to paid-in capital**\n\nPaid-in capital is the amount invested by shareholders into the company, typically recorded on the balance sheet under equity. It often appears as initial capital and any subsequent contributions or share capital increases.\n\n**Step 2: Examine \"Initial\" transactions**\n\nThe first dataset contains these lines related to initial paid-in capital:\n\n- {\"problem\": 2023-12-31, amount: 13,000,000.0} (initial paid-in capital)\n- {\"problem\": 2023-12-31, amount: 5,000,000.0} (additional initial deposit with bank and cash)\n\nWithin the first dataset, the \"Initial\" deposits sum to:  \n- 3,000,000 (cash deposit)  \n- 5,000,000 (bank deposit)  \n- 5,000,000 (fixed assets) â€” which could also be considered part of initial capital, as assets contributed by shareholders.\n\nThe total initial paid-in capital includes these components:\n- Cash: 3,000,000\n- Bank: 5,000,000\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000\n\nTotal initial paid-in capital: 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000\n\nThis aligns with the \"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\" in the solution.\n\n**Step 3: Check for any changes in capital over time**\n\nIn later transactions, there is no explicit mention of additional paid-in capital contributions or share issuance beyond initial contributions. All subsequent transactions involve operations, expenses, sales, purchases, and interest receivables/payables, which do not affect paid-in capital.\n\n**Step 4: Final amount**\n\nSince there are no subsequent increases or decreases explicitly stated, and the question states to include initial and final amounts, the final paid-in capital remains the same as the initial, i.e., 13,000,000.\n\n**Step 5: Summarize**\n\n- Initial paid-in capital: 13,000,000\n- Final paid-in capital: 13,000,000\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
