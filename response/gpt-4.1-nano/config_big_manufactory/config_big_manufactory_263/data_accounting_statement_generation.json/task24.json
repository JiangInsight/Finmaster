Since fixed assets are capitalized and depreciated, they are not part of the direct \"cost\" in the income statement as COGS. The typical \"cost\" for a product in income statement usually comes from the cost of inventory, raw materials, or direct costs associated with sales.\n\nIn the provided data, the first example suggests the total cost related to items sold (or inventory) is 4,410,000, which matches the sum of relevant purchase costs. \n\nGiven the pattern and the previous detailed example, the final total cost should be 4,410,000.00, as this appears to be the aggregated cost related to inventory or items in the income statement.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Cost\": \"4410000.00\"}}\n```",
