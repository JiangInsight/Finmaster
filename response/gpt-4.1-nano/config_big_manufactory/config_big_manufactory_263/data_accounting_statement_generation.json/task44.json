Identify all transactions that correspond to the purchase of fixed assets.\n\n2. Check the payment method and amount associated with each fixed asset purchase.\n\n3. Sum the actual amounts paid for fixed assets to get the total purchase amount in cash.\n\nFrom the first dataset:\n- There is a transaction labeled \"Fixed Asset20231231001\" with the following details:\n  - amount: 305354.43\n  - payment_method: Bank Transfer\n- No other fixed asset purchase transaction appears in the second dataset, but there is another fixed asset purchase with the same label and amount:\n  - Fixed Asset purchase on 2023-12-31 with amount 305354.43, paid via Bank Transfer.\n\nThus, the total amount spent on purchasing fixed assets (cash flow from the transaction) is **305354.43**.\n\nTherefore, the final purchase amount of fixed assets is **305354.43**.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"305354.43\"}}\n```",
