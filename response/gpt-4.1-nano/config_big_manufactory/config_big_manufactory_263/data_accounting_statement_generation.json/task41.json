The net change is based purely on the unpaid/paid status of purchases.\n\n**Additional unpaid:**\n\n- S002 on 2023-12-31: 290,000\n- S001 on 2023-12-31: 130,000\n\nTotal unpaid purchases as of the final period are 420,000.\n\n---\n\n### Dataset 2\n\nUnpaid Purchases:\n\n- 2023-12-31 S002: 800,000 (payable)\n- 2023-12-31 S001: 1,000,000 (payable)\n- 2023-12-31 S002: 1,600,000 (payable)\n- 2023-12-31 S009: 500,000 (payable)\n\nTotal unpaid amount: 800,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,600,000 + 500,000 = 3,900,000\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The net increase/decrease in AP is driven by unpaid purchases minus paid ones.\n\n- **Initial AP balance (from unpaid on 2023-12-31):**\n\n  - 420,000 (first dataset)\n  \n- **Additional unpaid (second dataset):**\n\n  - 3,900,000\n\n- **Total unpaid purchases at the end:**\n\n  - 420,000 + 3,900,000 = 4,320,000\n\n- **Total paid purchases** reduce AP, but the main focus for \"final accounts payable\" is to consider the remaining unpaid portion.\n\n---\n\n### Final Calculation:\n\n- The total accounts payable (unpaid bills) should be the sum of all unpaid purchases at the end of the period.\n\n- From **dataset 2**, the total unpaid amount is **3,900,000**.\n\n- From **dataset 1**, the total unpaid amount is **420,000**.\n\n- But since many paid purchases offset the unpaid, the **net change** in accounts payable over the period is:\n\n  - **Increase in AP = Total Unpaid at the end - Unpaid at the start**\n\n- At start, unpaid total was **420,000** (from first dataset).\n\n- At end, total unpaid is **3,900,000**.\n\n**Therefore, the net increase is:**\n\n3,900,000 - 420,000 = **3,480,000**\n\nBut, the problem asks for the *Final* accounts payable, which represents the total unpaid amount at the end of the period.\n\n**Final Accounts Payable: 3,900,000**\n\n---\n\n### Corrected answer: \n\nThe rise in accounts payable is the difference: **3,480,000**\n\nBut the *final amount* of accounts payable as per data is **3,900,000**.\n\n**Given the example's previous answer \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": 1590000.00**, it reflects the net change, which we have computed as:\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"3900000.00\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Final JSON Output:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": \"3900000.00\"}}\n```",
