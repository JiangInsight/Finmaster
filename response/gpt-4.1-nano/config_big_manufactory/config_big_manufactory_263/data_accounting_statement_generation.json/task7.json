(probably a different scenario)\n\nIn the first snippet, the initial fixed assets: 5,000,000.\n\nIn the second snippet, initial fixed assets: 8,000,000.\n\nAs the initial values are dated 2023-12-31, and the second snippet's total initial fixed assets add up to 8,000,000.\n\nConsidering the question asks about the initial and final amounts:\n\nThe initial fixed assets are given explicitly:\n\n- First snippet: 5,000,000\n\n- Second snippet: 8,000,000\n\nThe second snippet's total fixed assets value is 8,000,000, which is the initial amount plus the purchase amount minus depreciation.\n\nIt seems that the cumulative depreciation expense (around 45,748) is accounted for in the second snippet.\n\nFinal fixed assets in second snippet: 8,000,000.\n\nTherefore, the initial fixed assets are 5,000,000 (from the first snippet) and the final fixed assets are consistent with the second snippet's ending figure: 8,000,000 + additional purchases? The second snippet's final fixed assets amount is given explicitly as 8,000,000.\n\nIn summary, the initial fixed assets: 5,000,000\n\nThe final fixed assets: 8,000,000\n\nNow, these are the key figures required.\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Fixed Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Fixed Assets End Value': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
