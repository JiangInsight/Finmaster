However, per typical financial calculation, this is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Operating Cash Flow (from cash flow statement):**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -17,417,367.15\n\n**Net Income (from income statement):**\n- Net Profit: 405,999.64\n\n**Ratio:**\n- Operating Cash Flow / Net Income = -17,417,367.15 / 405,999.64 ≈ -42.90\n\nThis indicates a negative ratio since operating cash flow is negative and net income is positive.\n\n---\n\n### Final calculated ratios:\n- **Debt to Asset Ratio:** ~0.025\n- **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:** ~ -42.90\n\nBut considering the example solution provided in the description, perhaps the ratios are rounded or scaled differently. Since the example shows ratios like 0.14 and 4.41, but our calculations differ significantly.\n\n**Possible interpretation:** The original example ratios are simplified or scaled, but based on the actual calculated numerical data, these are our precise ratios.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.03\", \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-42.90\"}}\n```",
