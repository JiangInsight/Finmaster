                        "content": "Let's analyze the given data step by step to compute each required financial ratio.\n\n### Step 1: Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n- **Definition:** Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities / Average Current Liabilities\n- **Given:**\n  - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -17,417,367.15\n  - Current Liabilities at end = 727,140.68 (since no beginning balance for liabilities, assume the end value as best estimate)\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-17,417,367.15}{727,140.68} \\approx -23.96\n  \\]\n- Rounding to two decimal places: -23.96\n\n### Step 2: Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n- **Definition:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities / Total Debt\n- **Total Debt:**\n  - From balance sheet, total liabilities = 727,140.68 (current liabilities only, no info on long-term debt)\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{-17,417,367.15}{727,140.68} \\approx -23.96\n  \\]\n  (Same as previous, since only current liabilities are given)\n\n### Step 3: Inventory Turnover Ratio\n- **Definition:** Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n- **Given:**\n  - Cost of Goods Sold = 10,400,000.00\n  - Inventory at end = 8,400,000.00\n  - Inventory at start = 0.00\n- **Average Inventory:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{0 + 8,400,000}{2} = 4,200,000\n  \\]\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{10,400,000}{4,200,000} \\approx 2.48\n  \\]\n  (Total inventory turnover days: 2.48 times per period)\n\n### Step 4: Debt to Equity Ratio\n- **Definition:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Owner's Equity\n- **Total Debt:** 727,140.68\n- **Owner's Equity:** 2,840,599.64\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{727,140.68}{2,840,599.64} \\approx 0.256\n  \\]\n  Rounded to two decimal places: 0.26\n\n### Step 5: Quick Ratio\n- **Definition:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n- **Numerator:**\n  - Cash on Hand = 1,482,632.85\n  - Accounts Receivable = 10,221,447.35\n  - Interest Receivable = 20,559.00\n  - Sum = 1,482,632.85 + 10,221,447.35 + 20,559.00 = 11,724,639.20\n- **Denominator:** 727,140.68\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{11,724,639.20}{727,140.68} \\approx 16.12\n  \\]\n  However, previous ratio in example was 1.54, but that was with different values. Our calculation suggests very high quick ratio. Let's double-check.\n\nWait, note from the previous example, the quick ratio was 1.54, which suggests the numerator was about 1.54 times the denominator. Our calculation gives a much higher ratio due to larger receivables.\n\nBut the balance sheet shows:\n- Cash on Hand: 1,482,632.85\n- Accounts Receivable: 10,221,447.35\n- Interest Receivable: 20,559.00\n\nSum: approximately 11,724,639.20\n\nDividing by current liabilities:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{11,724,639.20}{727,140.68} \\approx 16.12\n\\]\n\nThis is a very high quick ratio, indicating strong liquidity of quick assets relative to liabilities.\n\n### Step 6: Current Ratio\n- **Definition:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{21,224,639.20}{727,140.68} \\approx 29.2\n  \\]\n  \nHigh current ratio indicates excellent liquidity position, but considering the large receivables and inventory, it makes sense.\n\n### Final summarized ratios:\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -23.96\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: -23.96\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio: 2.48\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.26\n- Quick Ratio: 16.12\n- Current Ratio: 29.2\n\nRounded to two decimals as per standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-23.96\", \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-23.96\", \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"2.48\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.26\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"16.12\", \"Current Ratio\": \"29.20\"}}\n```",
