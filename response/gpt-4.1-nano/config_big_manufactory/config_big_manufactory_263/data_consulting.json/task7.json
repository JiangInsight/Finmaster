                        "content": "To calculate the Free Cash Flow (FCF), we typically start with the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities and then subtract capital expenditures (purchase of fixed assets). \n\nGiven data:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -17,417,367.15\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -0.00 (which indicates no investments in fixed assets during this period)\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 0.00\n\nSince the purchase of fixed assets is zero, the FCF equates to the net cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures, which is zero here.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n1. Identify the net cash flow from operating activities: -17,417,367.15.\n2. Check for any cash spent on investments (purchase of fixed assets): 0.00.\n3. Free Cash Flow (FCF) = Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures.\n4. FCF = -17,417,367.15 - 0.00 = -17,417,367.15.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-17417367.15\"}}\n```",
