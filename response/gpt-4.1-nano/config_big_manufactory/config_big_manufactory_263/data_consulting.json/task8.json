Usually, ratios are expressed as decimal numbers.\n\nGiven the previous example's output of `'4.41'` for a ratio, it's likely that the ratio is in a decimal form and perhaps scaled by 1 or 100 as needed.\n\nIn our case:\n- The ratio ≈ -42.92\n\nExpressed as a positive ratio:\n- 42.92\n\nNow, to match the style of the example, the value might be rounded to two decimal places:\n\n- 42.92\n\n**Final step**:\n- Present the result:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"42.92\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Answer in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"42.92\"}}\n```",
