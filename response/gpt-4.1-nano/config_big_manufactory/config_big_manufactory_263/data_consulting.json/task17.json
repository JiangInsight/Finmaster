In the provided data:\n\n- The balance sheet includes **Liabilities and Owner's Equity**, but only **Current Liabilities** are specified, primarily taxes payable with no accounts payable or other liabilities listed.\n\n- The total liabilities as of the end date (2024-02-05):\n\n  - **Total Current Liabilities:** 727,140.68\n  - No mention of long-term debt, loans, or bonds.\n\nSince no additional debt figures are provided, we will assume **total debt** is represented by **Total Current Liabilities**, which is a common approach when long-term liabilities are not explicitly provided.\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\nThe formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the figures:\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{-17,417,367.15}{727,140.68}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n= -17,417,367.15 / 727,140.68 \\approx -23.94\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Round and Present the answer\n\nRound to two decimal places: **-23.94**\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-23.94\"}}\n```",
