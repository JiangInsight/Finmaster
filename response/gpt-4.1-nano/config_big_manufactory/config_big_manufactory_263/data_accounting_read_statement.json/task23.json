Review the provided income statement for any item explicitly indicating income from financial assets.\n2. Look for terms such as \"Interest Income,\" \"Financial Income,\" \"Investment Income,\" or similar.\n3. The only line item that fits this description in both the provided statements is \"Interest Income.\"\n4. The amount for \"Interest Income\" in the statement dated 2024-02-05 is 20559.00.\n\nTherefore, the income earned from financial assets is represented by \"Interest Income\" with an amount of 20559.00.\n\nFinal answer in required format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '20559.00'}}\n```",
