                        "content": "To find the income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities, we need to identify the positive revenue or income line items directly related to the core operations of the business.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Look for line items that represent revenue generated from the main business activities. Typically, these include \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue.\"\n2. The \"Total Revenue\" reflects the total income from core operations.\n3. The other income items, like \"Interest Income,\" are usually not part of core operating income but are non-operating income.\n\nIn the given data:\n- \"Main Business Revenue\" is 14,542,813.42\n- \"Total Revenue\" is also 14,542,813.42\n\nSince both match, and \"Main Business Revenue\" explicitly indicates core operational income, it is the most appropriate figure.\n\nTherefore, the income arising from the core operating activities is 14,542,813.42.\n\nAnswer in the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '14542813.42'} }\n```",
