                        "content": "First, I need to identify the relevant line items related to funds deposited into a bank. Typically, these include \"Cash on Hand,\" \"Bank Deposits,\" and possibly \"Interest Receivable\" or \"Accounts Receivable\" if they are directly related to bank funds, but generally, for deposit into a bank, the \"Bank Deposits\" account is the primary item.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Initial value of \"Bank Deposits\" is 15,000,000.00\n- Final value of \"Bank Deposits\" is 1,100,000.00\n\nThe change indicates funds deposited or withdrawn, but the task asks for funds deposited into the bank, including initial and final values.\n\n**Result:**\nInitial value: 15,000,000.00  \nFinal value: 1,100,000.00\n\n**Note:** Since the final value decreased, funds were withdrawn. Given the task wording, the deposit amounts are represented by these line items' initial and final balances.\n\nNow, I will format the answer according to the specified JSON structure.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"15000000.00\", \"end value\": \"1100000.00\"}}\n```",
