Locate the line involving \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable.\"\n2. The value associated with this line indicates how much the tax payable has changed.\n3. An increase in tax payable reflects an increase in taxes accrued but not yet paid.\n\nIn the provided data:\n- \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" has a value of **727140.68**, indicating an increase in tax payable.\n\nThus, the specific line item and value of the increase in amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'value': '727140.68'} }",
