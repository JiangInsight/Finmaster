Identify the two specific line items:\n   - Income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities: Typically, this is \"Main Business Revenue\" (or similar).\n   - Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period: Usually listed as \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\n2. Based on that, in the provided table:\n   - The line item \"Main Business Revenue\" with amount 14,542,813.42 represents income from core operations.\n   - The line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with amount 10,400,000.00 represents the inventories sold during the period.\n\n3. As per the instructions, maintain the order as shown in the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the extracted values are:\n- Income from core operating activities = 14,542,813.42\n- Inventories sold (Cost of Goods Sold) = 10,400,000.00\n\nFinal answer in the prescribed JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '14542813.42', 'value2': '10400000.00'}}\n```",
