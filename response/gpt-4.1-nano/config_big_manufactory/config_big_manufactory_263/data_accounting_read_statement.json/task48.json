The net profit (the amount of profit an entity retains after all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, have been deducted from total revenue).  \n2. The cash paid to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets (investing activities expenditure).\n\n**Step 2: Find the net profit**  \nFrom the line items, \"Net Profit\" explicitly states the profit figure:\n- **Net Profit:** 405999.64\n\n**Step 3: Find the cash paid for property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets**  \nThis corresponds to the line \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\":\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets:** 0.00\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the two required values**  \n- Profit retained after all expenses: **405999.64**  \n- Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment: **0.00**\n\n**Step 5: Construct the answer in the required JSON format**  \n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '405999.64', 'value2': '0.00'} }\n```\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '405999.64', 'value2': '0.00'} }\n```",
