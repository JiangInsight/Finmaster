From the balance sheet, we see the line item \"Interest Receivable\" has increased from 0.00 (initial) to 20559.00 (end). This indicates a change in the interest receivable during the period.\n\n2. The cash flow statement shows an \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" of -20559.00, meaning the interest receivable increased (since the change is negative, it's an increase in receivables).\n\n3. The initial interest receivable was 0.00, and the final value is 20559.00.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item with its initial and final amount for interest accrued but not yet received is:\n\n**Initial value:** 0.00  \n**Final value:** 20559.00\n\nAnswer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"20559.00\"}}\n```",
