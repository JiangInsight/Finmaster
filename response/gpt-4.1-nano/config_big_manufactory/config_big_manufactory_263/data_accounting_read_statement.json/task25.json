Typically, these costs are associated with selling, marketing, and delivery activities.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify relevant line items:**\n   - **Selling Expenses:** These are costs directly related to securing customer orders and promoting sales.\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold:** This is the cost of producing or purchasing the goods sold but isn't directly a selling or delivery cost; itâ€™s more about production.\n   - **Administrative Expenses:** Usually administrative costs are not directly related to sales or delivery.\n   - **Other expenses like Depreciation, Financial Expenses, etc.,** aren't directly linked to sales or delivery.\n\n2. **Focus on \"Selling Expenses\":**  \n   Selling Expenses typically include costs like advertising, sales commissions, shipping, and other costs to secure orders and deliver goods/services.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**  \n   The costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods/services are represented primarily by the \"Selling Expenses.\"\n\nFrom the given data:\n- **Selling Expenses** = 963,185.37\n\n**Answer:** 963,185.37\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"963185.37\"} }\n```",
