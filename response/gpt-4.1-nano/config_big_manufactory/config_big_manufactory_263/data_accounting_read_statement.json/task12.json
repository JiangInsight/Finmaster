Cash on Hand: initial = 5,000,000.00; end = 1,482,632.85 — current assets.\n2. Bank Deposits: initial = 15,000,000.00; end = 1,100,000.00 — current assets.\n3. Interest Receivable: initial = 0.00; end = 20,559.00 — current assets.\n4. Accounts Receivable: initial = 0.00; end = 10,221,447.35 — current assets.\n5. Inventory: initial = 0.00; end = 8,400,000.00 — current assets.\n\nSum of initial current assets:\n5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20,000,000\n\nSum of end current assets:\n1,482,632.85 + 1,100,000 + 20,559 + 10,221,447.35 + 8,400,000 = 21,224,639.20\n\nTherefore, the initial and final values of assets expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption are as above.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '20000000.00', 'end value': '21224639.20'}}\n```",
