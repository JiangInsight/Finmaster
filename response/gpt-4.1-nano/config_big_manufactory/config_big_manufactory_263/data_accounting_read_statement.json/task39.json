Examine the cash flow from investing activities, as assets held for sale are usually classified as non-current assets and would typically appear under investing activities.\n2. Look for line items mentioning assets in the context of sale or reduction.\n3. In the provided data, the relevant line item is \" (Increase) Decrease in Inventory,\" as inventory can include assets held for sale.\n4. The amount showing a decrease in inventory (which can include assets held for sale) is âˆ’8,400,000.00.\n\nSince the problem specifically asks for the line item and its value related to the reduction in assets held for sale, the decrease in inventories is a key indicator here.\n\nAnswer:\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-8400000.00\"}}",
