                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided income statement step by step.\n\n1. The line item representing profit or loss before tax (profit before tax) is explicitly given:\n   - Profit Before Tax: 1133140.32\n\n2. The total revenue, cost of goods sold, total expenses, and interest income involved in the calculation are provided:\n   - Total Revenue: 14542813.42\n   - Cost of Goods Sold: 10400000.00\n   - Total Expenses: 3030232.10\n   - Interest Income: 20559.00\n\n3. The task requires decomposing the profit before tax into four components from the input data. Based on typical income statement structure, a logical decomposition is:\n\n   Profit Before Tax = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses (Admin + Selling + Depreciation + Financial Expenses) + Interest Income\n\n   Alternatively, since \"Total Expenses\" usually includes all expenses (admin, selling, depreciation, financial expenses), and interest income impacts profit, the four components to consider could be:\n\n   - Gross Profit (from Main Business Revenue and Cost of Goods Sold)\n   - Administrative Expenses\n   - Selling Expenses\n   - Financial Expenses\n\n   Interest Income is an additional component affecting profit, so it can also be included.\n\n4. Final step: decompose profit before tax as:\n\n   Profit Before Tax = Gross Profit - (Admin + Selling + Depreciation + Financial Expenses) + Interest Income\n\n   Let's verify the calculation:\n\n   - Gross Profit = 4,142,813.42\n   - Sum of operating expenses (admin + selling + depreciation + financial expenses):\n     1. Administrative Expenses: 1,416,371.84\n     2. Selling Expenses: 963,185.37\n     3. Depreciation: 91,498.88\n     4. Financial Expenses: 559,176.01\n   - Total of these expenses: 1,416,371.84 + 963,185.37 + 91,498.88 + 559,176.01 = 3,030,232.10 (matches total expenses)\n\n   Then:\n   - Gross Profit - (Expenses) + Interest Income\n   = 4,142,813.42 - 3,030,232.10 + 20,559.00\n   = 1,112,580.32 + 20,559.00\n   = 1,133,139.32\n\n   The provided profit before tax is 1,133,140.32, which matches likely rounding differences (~1 difference).\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value\": \"1133140.32\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value1\": \"14542813.42\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value2\": \"10400000.00\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value3\": \"3030232.10\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value4\": \"20559.00\"\n  }\n}\n```",
