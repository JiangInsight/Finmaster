This typically relates to accounts payable, which records amounts owed to suppliers.\n\nSteps:\n1. Look for lines mentioning accounts payable.\n2. Focus on the values indicating a decrease, as a decrease in accounts payable means the entity has paid off some of its owed amounts.\n3. In the provided data, the relevant line is \"(Increase) (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\"\n4. The value for this line is 0.00, indicating no change during this period.\n5. Since the goal is to find a decrease, this would be a negative change, but the value is zero, so no reduction in accounts payable occurred.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided data, the specific line item indicating a decrease in amounts owed (if any) would be the one related to \"(Increase) (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\" Its value is 0.00, meaning there's no decrease in this period.\n\nAnswer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'}}\n```",
