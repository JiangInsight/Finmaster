                        "content": "To solve the problem, I need to identify and extract the liabilities that are expected to be settled in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle. These typically include current liabilities, such as accounts payable and taxes payable, but exclude non-current liabilities and ownerâ€™s equity.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Review the liabilities listed in the table:\n   - Accounts Payable: initial 0.00, end 0.00 (not included, as it remains zero)\n   - Taxes Payable: initial 0.00, end 727,140.68 (included, as it is a current liability payable in the normal course)\n2. Confirm these are within the current liabilities section, which generally indicates liabilities due in the short term.\n3. Sum the ending values of these current liabilities:\n   - Accounts Payable: 0.00\n   - Taxes Payable: 727,140.68\n4. Total amount of liabilities expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle = 727,140.68\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"727140.68\"}}\n```",
