Examine the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section.\n2. Locate any line item that indicates the purchase of assets, typically labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" or similar.\n3. The corresponding amount on this line represents the cash payments made for acquiring property, plant, and equipment.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is 0.00, indicating no cash payments for such assets during this period.\n- The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" also confirms no acquisitions occurred (âˆ’0.00).\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and value of cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment is zero in this case.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'}}\n```",
