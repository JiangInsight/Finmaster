Typically, this is labeled as \"Tax Expense\" or a similar term in financial statements.\n\nLet's analyze the provided data step-by-step:\n\n1. Review the line items to locate any line mentioning taxes:\n   - The line \"Tax Expense\" appears in the table.\n2. Check the value associated with \"Tax Expense\":\n   - Value is 727140.68\n3. The label \"Tax Expense\" indicates the amount of taxes payable or recoverable during the period. Since it is labeled as an expense, it represents taxes payable.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during this period is **727140.68**.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"727140.68\"}}\n```",
