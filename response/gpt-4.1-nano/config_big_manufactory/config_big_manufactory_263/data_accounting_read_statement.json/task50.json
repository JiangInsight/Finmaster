                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided cash flow statement step by step to extract the required four specific line items:\n\n1. **The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**:  \n   This is typically represented as **Depreciation**.\n\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period**:  \n   This is reflected by a decrease in **Inventory**.\n\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends**:  \n   This is the net cash flow from investing activities, excluding cash flows from operating activities and financing.\n\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**:  \n   This is given directly as **Net Increase** in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nNow, examining the data:\n\n- **Depreciation**: 91498.88\n- **Change in Inventory (assets held for sale/production)**: -8400000.00\n- **Net cash flow from investing activities**: -0.00 (since no cash flows are recorded, it indicates no acquisitions/dispositions of long-term assets or other investments)\n- **Net increase in cash and cash equivalents**: -17417367.15\n\n**Note:** The cash flow from investing is zero, which suggests no cash was involved in acquiring/disposing of assets, but the net cash flow from investing activities is what we're asked to identify â€” normally, this would include inflows/outflows from investments; here, it's zero.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91498.88', 'value2': '-8400000.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '-17417367.15'}}\n```",
