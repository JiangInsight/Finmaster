Subtract depreciation (~74,884.67 + previous depreciation).\n\nIn the second dataset, the \"fixed assets net End Value\" after adjustments are shown as approximately 12,019,968.64 from the detailed calculation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nFrom the provided detailed data, the initial value of fixed assets is 8,000,000, and the end value after the period and depreciation adjustments is approximately 12,019,968.64.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'fixed assets net Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'fixed assets net End Value': '12019968.64'}}\n```",
