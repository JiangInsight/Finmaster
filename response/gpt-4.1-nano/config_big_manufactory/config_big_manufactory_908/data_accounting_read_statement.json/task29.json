                        "content": "Let's analyze the income statement step by step to identify the total income and its decomposition:\n\n1. Identify the total income arising from the entity's ordinary activities:\n   - The key line item for total income is **Total Revenue**, which represents the total income from the entityâ€™s operations.\n   - From the statement, **Total Revenue** is 22,876,677.56.\n\n2. The total income can be decomposed into:\n   - **Main Business Revenue**: 22,876,677.56 (which is equal to Total Revenue here).\n  \n3. Since the task requires decomposition into at least one component sub-item originating from the statement, and the total (Main Business Revenue) is already a primary line item, its sub-item can be derived from categories that contribute to this main revenue.\n\n4. From the statement, the clear sub-components contributing to the overall income or gross profit can include:\n   - **Gross Profit**: 6,476,677.56. It is derived from Total Revenue minus Cost of Goods Sold.\n   - While Gross Profit is a profit measure (difference), for decomposition, we focus on component sub-items of total revenue.\n\n5. The only immediate sub-item directly related to total income that can be identified and related to the sources is **Interest Income**, which is an income component from financial activities.\n\n6. Based on the existing data:\n   - Total Revenue: 22,876,677.56\n   - Interest Income (component): 13,240.11\n  \n7. Because interest income is part of the total revenue and is explicitly listed, considering the guidelines, the sub-item will be Interest Income.\n\n8. Initial and final values for the sub-item:\n   - Initial value: 13,240.11\n   - Final value: 13,240.11\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"22876677.56\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"13240.11\"}}\n```",
