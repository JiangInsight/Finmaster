                        "content": "Let's analyze the given income statement step by step:\n\n1. The first target is the total income arising in the course of an entity's ordinary activities, which typically corresponds to \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue.\" Of these, \"Total Revenue\" explicitly summarizes income from ordinary activities.\n\n2. The second target is the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, which refers to \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\n3. The third target is the costs of general management and administration, which relates to \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n\nNow, checking the data:\n\n- Total income from ordinary activities: **Total Revenue** = 22876677.56\n- Inventory sold (costs): **Cost of Goods Sold** = 16400000.00\n- Administrative costs: **Administrative Expenses** = 1192395.86\n\nThe original order for output must follow the order of these three items:\n\n1. Total income arising from ordinary activities\n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold\n3. Costs of general management and administration\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '22876677.56', 'value2': '16400000.00', 'value3': '1192395.86'}}\n```",
