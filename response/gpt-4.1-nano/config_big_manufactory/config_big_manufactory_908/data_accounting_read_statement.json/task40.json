Locate the relevant line related to accounts payable: \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n2. The amount provided for \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is **2,000,000.00**.\n3. An increase in accounts payable indicates that the entity has received goods or services on credit and has not paid for them yet, thus increasing the amount owed.\n\nThus, the specific line item and value corresponding to the credit purchases (which increases the payable) are:\n\n- Line item: \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\"\n- Value: 2,000,000.00\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2000000.00'} }\n```",
