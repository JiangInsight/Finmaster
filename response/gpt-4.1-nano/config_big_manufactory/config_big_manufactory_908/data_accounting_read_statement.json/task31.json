                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided income statement data step by step:\n\n1. Identify the key line item: *Profit Before Tax*, which reflects the profit or loss before tax expense deduction.\n\n2. Extract the value of this item:\n   - Profit Before Tax = 3,082,821.36\n\n3. Decompose this profit into 4 components from the data:\n   - Main Business Revenue = 22,876,677.56\n   - Total Cost (or Cost of Goods Sold + Expenses) = 16,400,000.00 (Cost of Goods Sold) + 3,407,096.31 (Total Expenses) = 19,807,096.31\n   \n   However, note that \"Total Cost\" is given as 16,400,000.00 in the data, but based on typical structure, it consists of Cost of Goods Sold plus other expenses. To be precise, the calculation of profit components should be based on the main revenue minus the relevant expense components that contribute directly.\n\n   From the data, the components likely contributing directly to profit before tax are:\n   - Main Business Revenue: 22,876,677.56\n   - Total Expenses (sum of Administrative + Selling + Depreciation + Financial Expenses): 1,192,395.86 + 1,461,486.34 + 120,631.67 + 632,582.44 = 3,407,096.31\n   - Financial Income: 13,240.11 (added back)\n   - Total Expenses are credited as 3,407,096.31.\n\n4. Summarizing:\n   - Initial Data:\n     - Revenue: 22,876,677.56\n     - Expenses (Total Expenses): 3,407,096.31\n     - Financial Income: 13,240.11\n\n5. The profit before tax can be roughly calculated as:\n   Revenue - Expenses + Financial Income = 22,876,677.56 - 3,407,096.31 + 13,240.11 â‰ˆ 19,482,821.36, which differs from the provided Profit Before Tax (3,082,821.36). This indicates that other expenses or adjustments are involved, or the components breakdown elsewhere.\n\n6. The data show that the profit before tax is explicitly provided as 3,082,821.36, which aligns with the question's main requirement.\n\n7. Next, determine the four sub-items that make up this profit before tax:\n   - Likely candidates are the main components contributing to profit:\n     - Revenue (Main Business Revenue)\n     - Cost of Goods Sold\n     - Total Expenses\n     - Financial Income\n\n   - These are the core components involved in the profit calculation.\n\n**Final step:**\n\n- The profit before tax: **3,082,821.36**\n- Sub-items:\n  - Main Business Revenue: 22,876,677.56\n  - Cost of Goods Sold: 16,400,000.00\n  - Total Expenses: 3,407,096.31\n  - Interest Income: 13,240.11\n\n**Initial and final values of sub-items:**\n- sub_item value1 (Revenue): 22,876,677.56\n- sub_item value2 (Cost of Goods Sold): 16,400,000.00\n- sub_item value3 (Total Expenses): 3,407,096.31\n- sub_item value4 (Interest Income): 13,240.11\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"3082821.36\", \"sub_items_sub_item value1\": \"22876677.56\", \"sub_items_sub_item value2\": \"16400000.00\", \"sub_items_sub_item value3\": \"3407096.31\", \"sub_items_sub_item value4\": \"13240.11\"}}\n```",
