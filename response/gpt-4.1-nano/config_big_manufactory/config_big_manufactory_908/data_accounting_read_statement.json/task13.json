Typically, these are non-current assets such as property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and other long-term investments, which are not meant for immediate sale and are used in the company's operations.\n\nIn the given data, the relevant line items are:\n\n- Fixed Assets\n- Accumulated Depreciation\n- Total Non-current Assets\n\nSince we are interested in the total value of these assets as of initial and end dates, let's focus on Fixed Assets and its initial and final amounts.\n\n- Fixed Assets initial value: 8,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets end value: 10,729,032.26\n\nNote: Total Non-current Assets includes accumulated depreciation, but typically, the value of non-current assets for realization purposes is considered as the gross amount before depreciation. So, we consider Fixed Assets separately.\n\nThus, the initial value and final value of non-current assets are:\n\n- Initial value: 8,000,000.00\n- Final value: 10,729,032.26\n\n**Final answer in the required format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10729032.26'} }\n```",
