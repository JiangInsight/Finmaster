The main component of operating income is usually labeled as \"Main Business Revenue\" or similar.\n2. \"Total Revenue\" includes all income, but typically, the core operating income is represented by \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n3. Other income items such as \"Interest Income\" are considered financial income, not core operating income.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n- \"Main Business Revenue\" is 22,876,677.56\n- \"Total Revenue\" is also 22,876,677.56, indicating that \"Main Business Revenue\" is the primary revenue component.\n- There are no other revenues specified that are directly related to core operations.\n\nTherefore, the specific income from core operating activities is represented by the \"Main Business Revenue\" value.\n\nAnswer:\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"22876677.56\"}}",
