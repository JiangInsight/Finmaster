                        "content": "Let's analyze the cash flow statement step-by-step to identify the line item representing the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities related to the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments (excluding cash equivalents), as well as receipt of interest and dividends.\n\nStep 1: Locate the relevant section of cash flow from investing activities:\n\n- The given statement shows \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with a line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" of 2,729,032.26 and \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" of -2,729,032.26.\n\nStep 2: Recognize the sub-item involved:\n\n- The net cash flow from investing activities typically includes purchases/disposals of long-term assets and other investments, excluding cash equivalents, as well as receipt of interest and dividends (if any). Since the only explicit investment-related activity listed is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" and no other investments or interest/dividend receipts are separately listed, the net cash flow from investing activities appears to be the relevant figure.\n\nStep 3: Decompose the total net cash flow from investing activities:\n\n- In this case, the main component is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" of 2,729,032.26 (outflow). Since there is no mention of proceeds from asset disposal, interest, or dividends, we can consider \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" as the primary sub-item that contributed to the cash flows from investing activities.\n\nStep 4: Check for any other components:\n\n- The statement does not specify other investments or interest/dividends received, so the main sub-item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nFinal step: Present the answer in the required JSON format, indicating the total net cash flow from investing activities and its sub-item component.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value\": \"-2729032.26\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"2729032.26\"\n  }\n}\n```",
