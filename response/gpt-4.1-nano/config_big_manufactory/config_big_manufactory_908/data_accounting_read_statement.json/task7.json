The change in taxes payable is 1,143,833.89, hinting at tax expense during the period.\n\nTo find total expenses, we can consider:\n- Depreciation expense: 120,631.67\n- Taxes expense: 1,143,833.89\n\n**Total Expenses (approximate):** 120,631.67 + 1,143,833.89 = 1,264,465.56\n\nBut since typically, the direct expense line items are depreciation and taxes, and given the task's example focusing solely on line items, I will present these two key expense items as separate line items.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"120631.67\"}}\n```",
