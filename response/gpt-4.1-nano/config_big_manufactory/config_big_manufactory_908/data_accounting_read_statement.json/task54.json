These generally include selling expenses, administrative expenses related to sales, and costs directly associated with delivery such as shipping or distribution costs.\n\nIn the provided income statement section, the relevant line items are:\n\n- **Selling Expenses:** These are costs directly associated with promoting and securing customer orders, including sales commissions, advertising, and related costs.\n- **Administrative Expenses:** These often include costs related to the management and support functions that facilitate sales and delivery but also can encompass other administrative activities. When focusing specifically on costs to secure and deliver customer orders, selling expenses are the most relevant.\n\nThe line item explicitly related to costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services is **\"Selling Expenses\"**, with an amount of **1461486.34**.\n\nTherefore, the value to extract is **1461486.34**.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"1461486.34\"}}\n```",
