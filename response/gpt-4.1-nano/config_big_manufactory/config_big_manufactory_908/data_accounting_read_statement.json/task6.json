The task is to identify and extract tangible items held for use in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes, including their initial and final values.\n2. Based on accounting principles, such items are typically classified under \"Fixed Assets\" or similar categories.\n3. In the provided data, the relevant line items are \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation\" (which adjusts the value of fixed assets over time).\n4. The \"Initial amount\" for \"Fixed Assets\" is 8,000,000.00, and the \"End amount\" is 10,729,032.26.\n5. The accumulated depreciation, while relevant for net book value, is not included in the initial and final cost of the tangible fixed assets for purposes of initial and final valuation of fixed assets held.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item of interest is \"Fixed Assets.\"\n\nFinal Answer:\n- Initial Value: 8,000,000.00\n- End Value: 10,729,032.26\n\nHere's the JSON answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"10729032.26\"}}\n```",
