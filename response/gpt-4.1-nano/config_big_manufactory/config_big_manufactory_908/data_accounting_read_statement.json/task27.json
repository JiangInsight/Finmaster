                        "content": "To find the accumulated systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life, we need to identify the depreciation line item in the income statement.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Look for a line item that typically represents depreciation expense. Common terms are \"Depreciation,\" \"Amortization,\" or \"Depreciation and Amortization.\"\n2. In the provided income statement, the line item labeled \"Depreciation\" with an amount of 120631.67 on 2024-02-05 clearly indicates the depreciation expense for the period.\n3. Since the task is to identify the accumulated systematic allocation (which is the depreciation expense accumulated over time), and the given data only show a single period, the value provided (120631.67) represents the depreciation expense for that period, which is often assumed to be the systematic allocation for the period in question.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item value of accumulated depreciation (systematic allocation) in this context is 120631.67.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"120631.67\"}}\n```",
