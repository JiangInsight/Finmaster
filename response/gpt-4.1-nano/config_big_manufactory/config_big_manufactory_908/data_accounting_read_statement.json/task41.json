The line item **\"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\"** reflects changes in the amount of taxes owed but not paid yet. An increase indicates that taxes accrued are higher than taxes paid, meaning accrued taxes are increasing.\n\n2. The problem asks specifically for the value of \"increase\" in the amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid, which corresponds directly to the line **\"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\"**.\n\n3. In the given data for the date 2024-02-05, the value of \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" is **1143833.89**.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item is \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with the value **1143833.89**.\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1143833.89'} }\n```",
