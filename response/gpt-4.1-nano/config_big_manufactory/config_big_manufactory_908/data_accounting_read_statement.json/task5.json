Check for line items explicitly indicating assets held for sale (none explicitly labeled as such in the data).\n2. Consider \"Inventory\" as assets in production or ready for sale.\n3. Extract the initial and end values for inventory: \n\n- Initial Inventory: 0.00\n- End Inventory: 6,600,000.00\n\nThis matches the typical reporting of assets in the process of being manufactured or held for sale.\n\n**Final extraction:**\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- Final value: 6,600,000.00\n\n**Answer in required JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"6600000.00\"}}\n```",
