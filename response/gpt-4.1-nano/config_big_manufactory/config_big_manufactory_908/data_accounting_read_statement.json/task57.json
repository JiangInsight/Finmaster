                        "content": "Let's analyze the financial data step by step to identify any line items representing the addition to the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.\n\n1. Focus on the balance sheet section, particularly on liabilities related to accounts payable, as these typically represent credit purchases of goods/services.\n\n2. Notice the line: **\"Accounts Payable\"** with an **End_amount** of **2,000,000.00** as of 2024-02-05. This indicates the amount owed by the entity for goods/services received on credit that hasn't yet been paid.\n\n3. To find the specific addition during the period, compare the initial and end balances:\n\n   - Initial amount (2023-12-31): 0.00\n   - End amount (2024-02-05): 2,000,000.00\n\n4. The difference (addition) is:\n\n   2,000,000.00 - 0.00 = 2,000,000.00\n\n5. This signifies that during the period, the entity's accounts payable increased by 2,000,000.00, indicating an addition to the amount owed for goods/services purchased on credit.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe specific line item is **\"Accounts Payable,\"** and the value of the addition is **2,000,000.00**.\n\n**Final answer in the specified format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2000000.00'} }\n```",
