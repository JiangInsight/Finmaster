We look for account names related to taxes payable or accrued taxes.\n2. The relevant account in both balance sheets is \"Taxes Payable.\"\n3. The \"Taxes Payable\" account has initial and end amounts, indicating taxes accrued but not necessarily paid yet.\n\nFrom the first dataset:\n- Initial amount: 0.00\n- End amount: 271550.92\n\nFrom the second dataset:\n- Initial amount: 0.00\n- End amount: 1143833.89\n\nThese amounts represent the tax liabilities accrued but not yet paid at the initial and final dates respectively.\n\nSince the task asks specifically for the line items and values of tax accrued but not yet paid, and the line item is \"Taxes Payable,\" with initial and end values as provided, I will select the latest (end) values of \"Taxes Payable\" that reflect the current accrued taxes.\n\nAnswer:\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1143833.89'}}",
