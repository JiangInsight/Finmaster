These items typically include current assets such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and other assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within the operating cycle.\n\nExamining the provided data:\n\n- Cash on Hand: Initial 5,000,000.00; End 627,601.28\n- Bank Deposits: Initial 15,000,000.00; End -129,032.26 (a negative value suggests some correction, but overall it is an asset)\n- Interest Receivable: 0.00; 13,240.11\n- Accounts Receivable: 0.00; 15,362,611.64\n- Inventory: 0.00; 6,600,000.00\n\nTotal Current Assets are significant and include all these current assets. Since current assets are expected to be realized or consumed in the normal operating cycle, and the problem asks for the initial and final values of such assets, we sum the relevant line items.\n\nInitial Total Current Assets: 20,000,000.00  \nFinal Total Current Assets: 22,474,420.77\n\nThe total of current assets at the initial and end periods are directly provided and encompass assets expected to be realized or consumed.\n\nTherefore, the specific line items and values to report are the total current assets at the initial and end dates.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"20000000.00\", \"end value\": \"22474420.77\"}}\n```",
