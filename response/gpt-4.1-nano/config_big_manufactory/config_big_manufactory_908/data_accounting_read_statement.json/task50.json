The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life:\n   - Typically represented by \"Depreciation\" in cash flow statements.\n\n2. Reduction in assets held for sale, in production for sale, or in the process of manufacturing:\n   - Usually associated with declines in inventories or assets held for sale.\n   - Here, \"Decrease in Inventory\" seems relevant.\n\n3. Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities involving acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents, and receipt of interest and dividends:\n   - This should match \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\"\n\n4. Net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period:\n   - Represented directly by \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n**Step 2: Extract the relevant values:**\n\n- Depreciation: 120631.67\n- Reduction in assets held for sale/in manufacturing: -6600000.00 (Decrease in Inventory)\n- Cash flows from investing activities: -2729032.26 (Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities)\n- Net increase in cash and cash equivalents: -19501430.98 (Net Increase)\n\n**Step 3: Confirm the order:**\nThe task specifies to maintain the original order in the input, which is:\n\n1. Systematic allocation of depreciable amount: **Depreciation**\n2. Reduction in assets held for sale/in production: **Decrease in Inventory**\n3. Cash inflows/outflows from acquisition/disposal of long-term assets and investments: **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**\n4. Net addition in cash and cash equivalents: **Net Increase**\n\n---\n\n**Final reasoning:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value1\": \"120631.67\",\n    \"value2\": \"-6600000.00\",\n    \"value3\": \"-2729032.26\",\n    \"value4\": \"-19501430.98\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '120631.67', 'value2': '-6600000.00', 'value3': '-2729032.26', 'value4': '-19501430.98'}}\n```",
