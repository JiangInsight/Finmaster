The amount of profit the entity retains after all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization — this is the \"Net Profit\" value.\n\n2. The cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment, and other long-term assets — this is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" value.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n- The first line item is clearly labeled as \"Net Profit\" with the amount, which is the profit after expenses.\n\n- The second line item of interest in the investing activities section is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which is the cash payments for long-term asset acquisitions.\n\nMatching the values:\n\n- Net Profit = 1938987.47\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets = 2729032.26\n\nTherefore, the output should include these two values in the original order.\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1938987.47', 'value2': '2729032.26'}}\n```",
