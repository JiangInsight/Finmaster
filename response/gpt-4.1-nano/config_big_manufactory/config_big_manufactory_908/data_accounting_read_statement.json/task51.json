The task asks to identify and extract the specific line items representing interest accrued but not yet received, including their initial and final values.\n\n2. The relevant accounts related to accrued interest are typically labeled as \"Interest Receivable\" or similar.\n\n3. In the balance sheet data provided, the account \"Interest Receivable\" appears:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00 (on 2023-12-31)\n   - End_amount: 13240.11 (on 2024-02-05)\n\n4. The initial value of interest accrued but not yet received is zero, meaning no accrued interest at the start.\n\n5. The final value is 13240.11, indicating interest accrued but not yet received as of the latest date.\n\n6. Since only interest receivable directly relates to interest accrued but not yet received, and the initial and final amounts are provided, these are the key line items.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and amounts are:\n\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- Final value: 13240.11\n\nNow, present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"13240.11\"}}\n```",
