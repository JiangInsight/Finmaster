The key line item we are looking for is related to the \"carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period,\" which is typically recorded as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\n2. From the table, the line item that corresponds to this is \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" with the amount listed as 16,400,000.00.\n\n3. Since this value precisely represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, this is our target figure.\n\n4. No further calculations are necessary because the amount is directly given.\n\nTherefore, extracting the required information, the carrying amount of inventories sold is 16,400,000.00.\n\nThe answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"16400000.00\"}}\n```",
