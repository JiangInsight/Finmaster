                        "content": "Let's analyze the data step by step to compute the three financial ratios:\n\n**1. Net Cash Ratio:**  \nThis ratio measures the company's ability to cover its current liabilities with its cash and cash equivalents.\n- Cash and Cash Equivalents = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable  \n= 627,601.28 + (-129,032.26) + 13,240.11 = 511,809.13  \n(Note: Bank deposits here are negative, indicating a decrease or repayment, but since we're analyzing liquidity, negative balances are considered for actual cash equivalents, so total cash equivalents are: 627,601.28 - 129,032.26 + 13,240.11 = 511,809.13)\n\n- Total Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable  \n= 2,000,000 + 1,143,833.89 = 3,143,833.89\n\n- Net Cash Ratio = Cash and Cash Equivalents / Total Current Liabilities  \n= 511,809.13 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 0.163\n\n**2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio:**  \nThis ratio indicates how efficiently the company uses current assets to generate revenue.  \n- Total Current Assets = 22,474,420.77\n\n- Total Revenue = 22,876,677.56\n\n- Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Total Current Assets  \n≈ 22,876,677.56 / 22,474,420.77 ≈ 1.02\n\n**3. Quick Ratio (Acid-test ratio):**  \nThis evaluates the company's ability to meet short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.  \n- Quick Assets = Cash on Hand + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable  \n= 627,601.28 + 13,240.11 + 15,362,611.64 = 15,993,453.03\n\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n\n- Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \n≈ 15,993,453.03 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 5.09\n\n---\n\n### Final computed ratios:\n- **Net Cash Ratio** ≈ 0.16  \n- **Current Assets Turnover Ratio** ≈ 1.02  \n- **Quick Ratio** ≈ 5.09\n\n**Note:** The example provided in the initial solution used ratios like 4.41, 0.68, and 1.54, which seem based on different calculations or conventions. Our calculations are standard and based directly on the provided data.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Ratio\": \"0.16\", \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"1.02\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"5.09\"}}\n```",
