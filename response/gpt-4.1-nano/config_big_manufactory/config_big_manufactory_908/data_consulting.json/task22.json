Since deposits are cash in bank, we combine cash and deposits.\n\n**Quick Assets** = Cash + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n\n= 62,7601.28 + (−129,032.26) + 13,240.11 + 15,362,611.64\n\n= 62,760.128 + (−129,032.26) + 13,240.11 + 15,362,611.64\n\n= (62,760.128 - 129,032.26) + 13,240.11 + 15,362,611.64\n\n= (−66,272.132) + 13,240.11 + 15,362,611.64\n\n= (−66,272.132 + 13,240.11) + 15,362,611.64\n\n= (−53,032.022) + 15,362,611.64\n\n= 15,309,579.618\n\n**Quick Ratio** = 15,309,579.618 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 4.87\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Net Profit Margin\n\n**Net Profit Margin** = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1,938,987.47\n- Total Revenue = 22,876,677.56\n\nNet Profit Margin = (1,938,987.47 / 22,876,677.56) × 100 ≈ 8.48%\n\n---\n\n### Final answers:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Quick Ratio\": \"4.87\", \"Net Profit Margin\": \"8.48%\"}}\n```",
