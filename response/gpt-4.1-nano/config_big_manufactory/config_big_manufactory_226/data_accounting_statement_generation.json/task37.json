The relevant transaction type is \"Depreciation,\" and the amount recorded for this in the given data is the depreciation expense on assets.\n\nFrom the first dataset:\n- On 2024-01-01, there is a record:\n  - \"Depreciation\" with amount: 45751.41\n\nIn the second dataset:\n- On 2024-01-01, there is a record:\n  - \"Depreciation\" with amount: 45745.8\n- On 2024-02-01, there is a \"Depreciation\" with amount: 81887.42\n\nThe question asks for the *final* depreciation item, which would be the latest depreciation expense recorded just before or on the most recent date in the data, generally during the reporting period.\n\nThe latest depreciation expense recorded is on 2024-02-01, with an amount of **81887.42**.\n\nTherefore, the final depreciation item in the cash flow statement is **81887.42**.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Depreciation\": \"81887.42\"}}\n```",
