Typically, initial capital plus liabilities equal total assets; since no specific liabilities are given initially, assume all initial value correspond to owned assets and owners' equity.\n\nFrom the example, the total initial liabilities and owners' equity are given as **13,000,000.00**, but in the second dataset, the initial value is **13,000,000.00**, and the final is **13,216,409.49**.\n\nStep 2: Identify the ending total liabilities and owners' equity.\n- Summing all transaction amounts (purchases, expenses, sales, receivables, payables, etc.) will effectively change liabilities and equity accordingly.\n- Since the problem states \"calculate the total liabilities and owner's equity including initial and final amounts,\" we can sum all the changes during the period to the initial amount to get the final total.\n\nGiven the example solution, the total liabilities and ownersâ€™ equity at the initial point is **13,000,000.00**, and at the end point is **13,216,409.49**.\n\nTherefore, based on the data:\n\n**Final answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value': '13216409.49'}}\n```",
