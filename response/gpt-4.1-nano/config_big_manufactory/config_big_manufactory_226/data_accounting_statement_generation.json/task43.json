Cash received from sales (paid, unpaid, receivables collected)\n- Cash outflows from operating activities:\n  - Payments for purchases, expenses (administrative, sales, financial)\n  - Other operating cash payments\n\nStep 3: Sum total cash inflows from sales\n- Paid sales: cash payments, receivables collected\n- Unpaid sales: receivables, not received yet, so exclude\n\nStep 4: Sum total cash payments\n- Paid expenses (administrative, sales, financial, interest)\n- Purchased inventory or goods (cash payments for purchases)\n\nStep 5: Calculate net cash flow from operating activities\n- Net cash flows = total cash inflows from customers - total cash outflows to suppliers/employees\n\nNow, proceed step by step based on provided data:\n\n### Cash inflows:\nCollect cash from paid sales only (unpaid sales are receivables, not cash received yet).\n\nIdentify paid sales:\n- 2024-01-02: 40,445.25 (paid)\n- 2024-01-03: 233,587.28 (paid)\n- 2024-01-04: 289,119.85 (unpaid) -> exclude from cash inflows\n- 2024-01-05: 122,727.9 (paid)\n- 2024-01-06: 243,947.96 (paid)\n- 2024-01-07: 101,795.8 (paid)\n- 2024-01-08: 251,306.24 (unpaid) -> exclude\n- 2024-01-09: 63059.49 (paid)\n- 2024-01-10: 124,688.16 (unpaid) -> exclude\n- 2024-01-11: 749,601.75 (unpaid) -> exclude\n- 2024-01-12: 193,782.6 (paid)\n- 2024-01-13: 265,419.24 (paid)\n- 2024-01-14: 24676.98 (unpaid) -> exclude\n- 2024-01-15: 130,993.41 (paid)\n- 2024-01-16: 61926.77 (paid)\n- 2024-01-17: 101,795.8 (paid)\n- 2024-01-18: 203,158.77 (unpaid) -> exclude\n- 2024-01-19: 590,628.7 (unpaid)\n- 2024-01-20: 402,869.4 (paid)\n- 2024-01-21: 664,435.83 (paid)\n- 2024-01-22: 67,982.82 (unpaid) -> exclude\n- 2024-01-23: 54,818.96 (paid)\n- 2024-01-24: 121,475.35 (unpaid) -> exclude\n- 2024-01-25: 124,952.5 (unpaid) -> exclude\n- 2024-01-26: 168,960.87 (paid)\n- 2024-01-27: 120,789.8 (paid)\n- 2024-01-28: 12,697.67 (paid)\n- 2024-01-29: 35752.38 (paid)\n- 2024-01-30: 1,412,458.33 (unpaid) -> exclude\n- 2024-01-31: 1,417,458.33 (unpaid) -> exclude\n- 2024-02-01: 1,999,604.61 (unpaid) -> exclude\n- 2024-02-03: 2,028,402.09 (unpaid) -> exclude\n- 2024-02-04: 1,056,960.17 (unpaid) -> exclude\n- 2024-02-05: 480,059.69 (paid)\n\nTotal cash received from sales (paid only):\n\n- 40,445.25\n- 233,587.28\n- 122,727.9\n- 243,947.96\n- 101,795.8\n- 193,782.6\n- 265,419.24\n- 130,993.41\n- 61,926.77\n- 217,95.8\n- 54,818.96\n- 168,960.87\n- 120,789.8\n- 12,697.67\n- 35,752.38\n- 480,059.69\n\nSum:\n= 40,445.25 + 233,587.28 + 122,727.9 + 243,947.96 + 101,795.8 + 193,782.6 + 265,419.24 + 130,993.41 + 61,926.77 + 217,95.8 + 54,818.96 + 168,960.87 + 120,789.8 + 12,697.67 + 35,752.38 + 480,059.69\n\nCalculations:\n- 40,445.25 + 233,587.28 = 274,032.53\n- +122,727.9 = 396,760.43\n- +243,947.96 = 640,708.39\n- +101,795.8 = 742,504.19\n- +193,782.6 = 936,286.79\n- +265,419.24 = 1,201,706.03\n- +130,993.41 = 1,332,699.44\n- +61,926.77 = 1,394,626.21\n- +217,95.8 = 1,416,422.01\n- +54,818.96 = 1,471,241.97\n- +168,960.87 = 1,640,202.84\n- +120,789.8 = 1,760,992.64\n- +12,697.67 = 1,773,690.31\n- +35,752.38 = 1,809,442.69\n- +480,059.69 = 2,289,502.38\n\nTotal cash inflow from operating activities: **2,289,502.38**\n\nStep 6: Sum outflows for expenses and purchases\n- Payments for purchases (cash payments):\n  -
