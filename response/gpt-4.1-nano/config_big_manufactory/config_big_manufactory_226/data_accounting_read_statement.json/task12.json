These typically include current assets such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and other similar items.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. **Identify current assets**: They are usually the assets that are expected to be sold, consumed, or converted into cash within the operating cycle.\n2. **Locate relevant line items**: Metrics like Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Accounts Receivable, and Inventory are classic examples.\n3. **Note their initial and end values** as of specific dates.\n4. **Extract these values** for final reporting.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- Cash on Hand: initial = 5,000,000.00, end = -1,980,427.60\n- Bank Deposits: initial = 15,000,000.00, end = 385,137.69\n- Accounts Receivable: initial = 0.00, end = 12,792,007.89\n- Inventory: initial = 0.00, end = 9,100,000.00\n\nTotal current assets are the summation of these line items, but since the task specifies extracting specific line items, we'll identify individual line items.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"20000000.00\", \"end value\": \"20314894.50\"}}\n```\n\nThis reflects the total current assets, which are expected to be realized or used in the normal course of operations, as given in the balance sheet for initial and end periods.",
