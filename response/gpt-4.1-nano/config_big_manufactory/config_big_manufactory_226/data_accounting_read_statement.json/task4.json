Review the relevant line item: \"Interest Receivable\"\n2. Check the initial and end amounts:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n   - End_amount: 18176.52 (as of 2024-02-05)\n3. The interest receivable increased from 0.00 to 18176.52, indicating that this amount is interest accrued but not yet received at the end date.\n\nTherefore, the initial value of interest accrued but not yet received was 0.00, and the final value is 18176.52.\n\n**Final answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '18176.52'}}\n```",
