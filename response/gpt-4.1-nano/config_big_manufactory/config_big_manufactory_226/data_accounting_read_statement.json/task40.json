Review all line items for references to liabilities or payables:\n   - \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is the relevant line for amounts owed related to goods/services purchased on credit.\n   \n2. Check the value of this line:\n   - The value is 0.00, indicating no change in accounts payable during this period.\n\n3. Since no increase or decrease is recorded for accounts payable, there was no addition to the amount owed for credits purchased during this period.\n\nConclusion:\n- The specific line item for the addition in the amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit is \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\"\n- The amount is 0.00, indicating no change in this liability during the period.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
