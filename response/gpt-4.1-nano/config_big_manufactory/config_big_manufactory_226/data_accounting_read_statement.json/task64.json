If the second dataset is to be prioritized, then the values would be adjusted accordingly. But, generally, I will pick the first set for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"-1373590.51\", \"value2\": \"1590000.00\", \"value3\": \"13000000.00\"}}\n```",
