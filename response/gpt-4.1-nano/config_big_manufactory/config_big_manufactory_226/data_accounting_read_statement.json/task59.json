                        "content": "To solve the task, we need to extract two specific line items for each of the three financial statements: \n\n1. The amount of interest accrued but not yet received (interest receivable), specifically the **end value**.\n2. The net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period, which is the change in cash and cash equivalents from the beginning to the end.\n\nLet's analyze each statement in turn:\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet:\n- The interest accrued but not yet received is directly given as **Interest Receivable**.\n- The net change in cash and cash equivalents is the difference between **Ending Balance** and **Beginning Balance** of cash and cash equivalents.\n\n**Interest Receivable end value**: 18,176.52  \n**Cash and Cash Equivalents net increase**:\n- Beginning balance of cash and cash equivalents: 20,000,000.00\n- Ending balance: -1,595,289.91\n- Net change = Ending - Beginning = -1,595,289.91 - 20,000,000.00 = -21,952,289.91\n\n### 2. Income Statement:\n- The specific interest income is given directly as **Interest Income**, which is 18,176.52 (the same as interest receivable at the end).\n- There is no direct additional cash flow figure here. However, based on the pattern, the net addition in cash corresponds to the change in cash and cash equivalents, which we already calculated from the Balance Sheet: **-21,952,289.91**.\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement:\n- The interest accrued but not yet received again appears as **Interest Income**: 18,176.52.\n- The net change in cash during the period already provided as **Net Increase**: -21,595,289.91\n\n### Final answers:\n- Interest accrued but not yet received (interest receivable / interest income): 18,176.52\n- Net addition in cash and cash equivalents: -21,595,289.91\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The differences in the net cash flow actual used in calculations come from the beginning and ending balances, which match the data. The interest income from the income statement aligns with interest receivable.\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"18176.52\", \"value2\": \"-21595289.91\"}}\n```",
