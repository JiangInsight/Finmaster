The question asks us to identify and extract the line item related to \"tax accrued but not yet paid,\" based on the balance sheet data.\n\n2. The relevant line items related to taxes are:\n   - \"Taxes Payable\" (which indicates taxes owed but unpaid at a specific date).\n\n3. In the provided data, \"Taxes Payable\" appears in both the initial and end values:\n   - Initial value: 0.00\n   - End value: 1015922.54\n\n4. Since \"Taxes Payable\" reflects taxes accrued but not yet paid, we are asked for:\n   - Initial value\n   - Final value\n\n**Therefore:**\n\nInitial value of taxes accrued but not yet paid = 0.00\n\nFinal value of taxes accrued but not yet paid = 1,015,922.54\n\nNow, presenting the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"1015922.54\"}}\n```",
