Generally, these are included in cash flow or income statements. Since the question asks for \"the amount of profit an entity retains after all expenses,\" it corresponds to the net profit after these deductions.\n\nIn typical financial statements, the \"Net Profit\" already accounts for all those expenses, unless specified otherwise. The depreciation amount is listed, but as per standard accounting, net profit is calculated after depreciation, interest, and taxes.\n\nThe key term here is \"profit an entity retains after all expenses,\" which aligns with the net profit figure provided.\n\nTherefore, the retained profit after all expenses is: **1,842,166.21**\n\nAnswer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1842166.21'}}\n```",
