The key line items to consider are \"Paid-in Capital\" and \"Total Owner's Equity.\"\n2. \"Paid-in Capital\" represents the amount shareholders contributed in exchange for shares. It generally indicates the initial capital contribution.\n3. \"Total Owner's Equity\" includes the paid-in capital and retained earningsâ€”reflecting the total equity attributable to shareholders at a given point.\n\nIn this sheet:\n\n- \"Paid-in Capital\" initially was 28,000,000.00 and remained the same at the end, indicating no additional contributions or withdrawals.\n- \"Total Owner's Equity\" increased from 28,000,000.00 initially to 29,842,166.21 at the end, likely due to retained earnings.\n\nSince the question specifically asks for the amount of capital contributed by shareholders at initial and final points, the most relevant line item is \"Paid-in Capital.\"\n\n**Therefore:**\n\n- Initial value of shareholder contribution: 28,000,000.00\n- Final value of shareholder contribution: 28,000,000.00\n\n**Answer in the required JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '28000000.00', 'end value': '28000000.00'}}\n```",
