Look at the liabilities section, specifically current liabilities which are usually settled in the normal course of operations.\n2. The most relevant line items include Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable.\n3. In this case:\n   - Accounts Payable initial value: 0.00 (no change, not relevant for liabilities expected to settle in operating cycle)\n   - Taxes Payable initial value: 0.00, final value: 1,015,922.54 (this is a short-term liability and expected to settle in the normal operating cycle)\n4. The total current liabilities include Taxes Payable as the only non-zero item, which is 1,015,922.54 at the end.\n\nFinal answer:\n- Initial value of liabilities expected to be settled in the operating cycle: 0.00\n- Final value of liabilities expected to be settled in the operating cycle: 1,015,922.54\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1015922.54'}}\n```",
