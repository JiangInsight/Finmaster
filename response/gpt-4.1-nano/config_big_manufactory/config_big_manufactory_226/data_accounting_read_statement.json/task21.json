However, for the pure income from core operating activities, gross profit is typically the primary indicator, with consideration of operational costs if we want net income from core activities.\n\nGiven the task specifies \"income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities,\" the key figures are:\n- Main Business Revenue\n- Total Revenue\n\nThe most relevant, straightforward measure of core operating income is the main revenue item.\n\nTherefore, the income arising in the course of core operations is the amount of \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n\nFinal step: Present the identified figure in the expected JSON response.\n\nAnswer:\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"20318450.67\"}}",
