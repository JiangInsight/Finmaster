A decrease in accounts payable over the period indicates that the entity paid off some of its liabilities, i.e., decreased what it owes.\n\nLooking at the provided data:\n\n- The line \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" shows a value of 0.00, indicating no change in accounts payable during this period. Since no reduction is recorded here, there's no decrease in liabilities owed, based on this line.\n\n- The main indicator for decrease would be a negative value in \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable,\" but here it's 0.00, meaning no decrease.\n\nTherefore, the key line to consider is \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable,\" and since it is zero, **there is no decrease in amounts owed to the entity during this period** based on the data provided.\n\nHowever, the task states to identify and extract the specific line items and value of a decrease. Since no decrease is recorded explicitly, the answer should reflect that.\n\n**Final step:** If a decrease existed, it would be shown as a negative value in \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\" Since it's zero, the answer is that there's no decrease.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'}}\n```",
