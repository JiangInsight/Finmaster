Common terminology includes \"Held for Sale,\" \"Assets in Production for Sale,\" or similar descriptions.\n\nIn the given data, the relevant line items are:\n- Inventory: Often includes assets in the process of being manufactured or prepared for sale.\n- Assets held for sale explicitly are not directly labeled, but inventory generally covers assets intended for sale or in production for sale.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Check all asset-related line items.\n2. Determine which ones are held for sale or in production for sale.\n3. The \"Inventory\" line item typically encompasses assets in various stages of being manufactured or prepared for sale.\n4. The value should reflect the initial and final amounts as per the data provided.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Inventory initial value: 0.00\n- Inventory final value: 9,100,000.00\n\nThus, the assets held for sale in this context can be identified as inventory, with the initial and final values.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '9100000.00'}}\n```",
