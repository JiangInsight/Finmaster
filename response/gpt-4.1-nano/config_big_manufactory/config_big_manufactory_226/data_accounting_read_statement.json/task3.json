Typically, \"Accounts Receivable\" is the line item that records amounts owed by customers for credit sales.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Examine the provided table for relevant line items: The primary item of interest here is \"Accounts Receivable\".\n2. Check the initial and end amounts for \"Accounts Receivable\" to find the initial and final values.\n3. The initial value of \"Accounts Receivable\" is 0.00 (at 2023-12-31).\n4. The end value of \"Accounts Receivable\" is 12792007.89 (at 2024-02-05).\n\nTherefore, the amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit increase from 0.00 to 12,792,007.89.\n\nFinal answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '12792007.89'}}\n```",
