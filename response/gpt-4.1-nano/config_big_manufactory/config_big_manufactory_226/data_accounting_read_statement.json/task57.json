This is typically represented in the financial statements as \"Accounts Payable\" or similar, indicating amounts due for credit purchases.\n\n- In the balance sheet, \"Accounts Payable\" is shown with initial and end amounts. At the start, it is zero; at the end, there is a certain amount.\n- The change in \"Accounts Payable\" over the period indicates the increase in credit obligations.\n- In the cash flow statement, the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is listed, reflecting the net change in credit obligations.\n\nIn the balance sheet:\n- Initial Amount: 0.00\n- End Amount: 0.00\n\nIn the cash flow:\n- Change in Accounts Payable: 0.00\n\nThe change in \"Accounts Payable\" is zero, which indicates no new increase in credit owed during the period.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and value of the addition to the amount owed for goods/services purchased on credit during the period is zero.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'} }",
