Average Accounts Receivable:**\n\n- Initial Accounts Receivable (2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End Accounts Receivable (2024-02-05): 12,792,007.89\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable = (Initial + End) / 2\n= (0.00 + 12,792,007.89) / 2\n= 6,396,003.945\n\n**2. Net Credit Sales:**\n\n- Since the problem provides total revenue and the cash flow statement shows the decrease in Accounts Receivable (which corresponds to cash collections), we can assume that total revenue approximates credit sales over the period because no other sales data is provided.\n\n- From the income statement:\n\nTotal Revenue = 20,318,450.67\n\n- From cash flow:\n\nDecrease in Accounts Receivable = 12,792,007.89\n\nNet credit sales (assuming all sales are on credit and collected within this period) = 20,318,450.67\n\n**3. Calculate Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:**\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n= 20,318,450.67 / 6,396,003.945 â‰ˆ 3.18\n\n**4. Final rounding:**\n\nRound to two decimal places: 3.18\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.18\"}}\n```",
