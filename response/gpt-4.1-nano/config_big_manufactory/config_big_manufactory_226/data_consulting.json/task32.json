Free Cash Flow (FCF):**  \nFCF = Cash flow from operating activities - Purchase of fixed assets  \n= -18,924,462.44 - 2,670,827.47  \n= **-21,952,289.91**\n\n**2. Return on Assets (ROA):**  \nROA = Net income / Average total assets  \nSince we only have one year's data, we'll use end-year assets as the basis:  \nNet income = 1,842,166.21  \nTotal assets at end: 30,858,088.75  \nROA = (1,842,166.21 / 30,858,088.75) * 100 ≈ 5.97%  \n(Note: Given the negative cash flows and high expenses, actual ROA in other contexts might differ, but we'll go with this calculation.)\n\nHowever, the net income is positive here, so ROA is positive.\n\n**3. Return on Equity (ROE):**  \nROE = Net income / Average equity  \nEquity at end: 29,842,166.21  \nROE = (1,842,166.21 / 29,842,166.21) * 100 ≈ 6.17%\n\n**4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:**  \n= Operating cash flow / Net income  \n= -18,924,462.44 / 1,842,166.21 ≈ -10.27\n\nSince the ratio is often expressed as a positive percentage or value, but here it's negative, indicating negative operational cash flow relative to income. We keep the ratio as is.\n\n**5. Net Profit Margin:**  \n= Net income / Total revenue  \n= 1,842,166.21 / 20,318,450.67 ≈ 0.0908 or 9.08%\n\n**6. Gross Profit Margin:**  \n= Gross profit / Total revenue  \n= 5,718,450.67 / 20,318,450.67 ≈ 0.281 or 28.1%\n\n---\n\n**Final JSON answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-21952289.91\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"5.97%\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"6.17%\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-10.27\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"9.08%\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"28.10%\"\n  }\n}\n```",
