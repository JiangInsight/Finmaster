                        "content": "To find the Cash to Current Debt Ratio, we need the value of Cash and the value of Current Debt (which is the Total Current Liabilities). The ratio is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash to Current Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nStep 1: Determine Cash at the End of Period\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand at end: -1,980,427.60\n- Bank Deposits at end: 385,137.69\n- Interest Receivable at end: 18,176.52 (considered as cash equivalent)\n- Accounts Receivable at end: 12,792,007.89 (also a liquid asset, but typically cash equivalents are only cash + immediate equivalents)\n\nHowever, in typical financial ratios, Cash includes Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable, assuming all are liquid assets.\n\nCalculate total cash:\n\\[ \\text{Cash} = -1,980,427.60 + 385,137.69 + 18,176.52 = -1,577,113.39 \\]\n\nNote: The negative cash balance indicates an overdraft situation. We will use the actual balance for calculation.\n\nStep 2: Determine Current Liabilities\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Taxes Payable at end: 1,015,922.54\n- Accounts Payable: 0.00 (no accounts payable at end)\n\nTotal Current Liabilities:\n\\[ \\text{Current Liabilities} = 1,015,922.54 \\]\n\nStep 3: Calculate the ratio\n\\[ \\text{Cash to Current Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-1,577,113.39}{1,015,922.54} \\approx -1.55 \\]\n\nSince the negative ratio indicates negative cash relative to current debt, but ratios are typically reported as positive figures representing liquidity, we can report the absolute value.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is approximately 1.55, or expressed as a ratio of 0.23 considering typical ratio presentation, but in this case, the magnitude is about 1.55.\n\nHowever, the initial problem's example shows a ratio of 0.23, so it's likely they used only the positive cash balance (excluding negative overdraft) or specific cash components.\n\nFor conservativeness, let's take the sum of positive cash components:\n- Bank Deposits: 385,137.69\n- Interest Receivable: 18,176.52\n- Cash on Hand: treat as positive for calculation (but original is negative, so exclude negative cash)\n\nTotal positive cash:\n\\[ 385,137.69 + 18,176.52 = 403,314.21 \\]\n\nUsing this, the ratio:\n\\[ \\frac{403,314.21}{1,015,922.54} \\approx 0.397 \\]\n\nRounded to two decimal places: 0.40\n\nGiven the example's ratio of 0.23 in the example, and in common practice, the ratio is often calculated with total cash on hand (including bank deposits and cash), but negative cash indicates liquidity problems; hence, reporting the ratio based on positive cash components aligns better.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"0.40\"}}\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"0.40\"}}\n```",
