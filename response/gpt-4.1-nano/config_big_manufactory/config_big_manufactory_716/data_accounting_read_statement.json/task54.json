Since the question asks for the specific line item, \"Selling Expenses\" is the relevant line.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item of costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services is \"Selling Expenses.\"\n\nThe value is the amount listed under \"Selling Expenses.\"\n\nAnswer: 493854.67 (from the first problem example, consistent with the typical classification).\n\nBut since the problem states \"Based on the financial statement,\" and we're applying that to the provided financial data, the precise line item is \"Selling Expenses,\" and the value is 1177105.26 (from the second problem data).\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1177105.26'} }",
