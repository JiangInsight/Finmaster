The task is to identify and extract line items from the balance sheet that are expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle.\n2. These items generally include current assets such as cash, receivables, inventory, and other assets that are expected to be converted into cash or consumed within the operating cycle.\n3. Non-current Assets like fixed assets and accumulated depreciation are typically not included unless they are intended for sale.\n4. From the given data, the key current assets are:\n   - Cash on Hand\n   - Bank Deposits\n   - Interest Receivable\n   - Accounts Receivable\n   - Inventory\n\n5. We are asked to note both the initial and end values of these line items, which represent the total assets expected to be realized or for sale/consumption during the operating cycle.\n\n**Extracted line items:**\n- Cash on Hand: initial 5,000,000.00; end 6,057,264.53\n- Bank Deposits: initial 15,000,000.00; end 1,020,005.47\n- Interest Receivable: initial 0.00; end 14,887.89\n- Accounts Receivable: initial 0.00; end 14,921,566.06\n- Inventory: initial 0.00; end 7,400,000.00\n\nSum of initial current assets:\n5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20,000,000.00\n\nSum of end current assets:\n6,057,264.53 + 1,020,005.47 + 14,887.89 + 14,921,566.06 + 7,400,000.00 = 29,413,723.95\n\n**Final answer in the required format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"20000000.00\", \"end value\": \"29413723.95\"}}\n```",
