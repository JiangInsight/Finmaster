The two specific line items are:\n   - Income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities, which is generally \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue.\"\n   - Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, which corresponds to \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\n2. In the provided income statement, the first line (Main Business Revenue) represents income from core operations.\n\n3. The \"Cost of Goods Sold\" indicates the amount of inventories sold during the period.\n\n4. According to instructions, maintain the original order as shown in the input, so the first item is the revenue, and the second item is the cost of goods sold.\n\nApplying this reasoning to the given data:\n\n- Revenue: 28572608.70\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 20200000.00\n\nNow, formulate the answer in the specified JSON format.\n\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28572608.70', 'value2': '20200000.00'} }",
