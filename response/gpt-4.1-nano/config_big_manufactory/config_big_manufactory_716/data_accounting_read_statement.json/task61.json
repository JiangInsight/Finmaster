Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets\n\n**Step 1: Identify the costs to secure orders and deliver goods/services**\n\nIn financial statements, these costs are generally reflected as:\n\n- Selling Expenses: These include costs related to marketing, selling, and delivering products/services. Typically, \"Selling expenses\" cover costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services.\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Selling Expenses = 1177105.26\n\nIn the example, \"costs to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services\" are associated with \"Selling Expenses.\"\n\n**Step 2: Identify cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets**\n\nIn the cash flow statement, cash payments for property, plant, and equipment are usually shown as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets = 2479994.53\n\nThis directly relates to cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment.\n\n**Step 3: Summarize and prepare the answer**\n\nSince the question requests the two specific line items and their values:\n\n- First: Costs for securing customer orders and delivering goods/services -> Selling Expenses\n- Second: Cash payments for property, plant, and equipment -> Purchase of Fixed Assets\n\n**Step 4: Match with the example format**\n\nThe example output shows the values only, labeled as 'value1' and 'value2'. We'll follow the same.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1177105.26', 'value2': '2479994.53'}}\n```",
