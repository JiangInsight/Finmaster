Locate the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section.\n2. Extract the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" which indicates the net amount of cash associated with investment activities (purchase and sale of fixed assets, investments, etc.).\n3. The value for \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is given as -2,479,994.53.\n\nThe problem asks for this amount, which represents the net cash flows from investing activities, including acquisitions/disposals of long-term assets and investments, receipt of interest and dividends (if included), but the provided data primarily shows the purchase of fixed assets.\n\nThe sub-item component here is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which has a value of 2,479,994.53 (noting the sign convention: this is an outflow, hence negative).\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n- The net cash flow from investing activities is -2,479,994.53.\n- This net value directly reflects the net acquisition of long-term assets.\n- The sole component provided is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which amounts to 2,479,994.53.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-2479994.53\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"2479994.53\"}}\n```",
