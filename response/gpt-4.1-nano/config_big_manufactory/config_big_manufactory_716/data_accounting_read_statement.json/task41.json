The key indicator here is \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable.\"\n2. An increase in tax payable suggests more taxes have been accrued but not paid, thus increasing the liability.\n3. The amount listed under \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" reflects the change in tax payable for the period.\n\nFrom the provided statement:\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable | 1428630.43 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThis line item shows an increase of 1,428,630.43, indicating that the amount of tax accrued but not yet paid has increased.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1428630.43'}}\n```",
