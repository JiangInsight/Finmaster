                        "content": "Let's analyze the income statement step by step and identify the four specific line items based on the provided descriptions:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**  \n   - This typically refers to selling and administrative expenses, often categorized under \"Selling Expenses\" and \"Administrative Expenses.\"  \n   - In this context, the combined value of \"Selling Expenses\" and \"Administrative Expenses\" reflects costs related to securing and delivering customer orders.\n\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**  \n   - This refers to \"Financial Expenses.\"\n\n3. **The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**  \n   - This is \"Depreciation.\"\n\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period**  \n   - This is \"Tax Expense.\"\n\nNow, extract each value from the statement:\n\n- Selling Expenses: 1,177,105.26\n- Administrative Expenses: 1,544,669.73\n- Financial Expenses: 372,003.12\n- Depreciation: 120,970.16\n- Tax Expense: 1,428,630.43\n\nThe question asks only for these four specific line items, so the selected values are:\n\n- Cost to secure and deliver customer orders: Since both Selling and Administrative Expenses contribute, but the task's previous example indicates to select a single relevant line item, but if considering multiple, they are maintained in order. The example's pattern is to pick the main element (here, \"Selling Expenses\" is closely linked to costs of securing and delivering orders). Alternatively, since both are about costs related to customer orders, perhaps both should be included?  \n   - The instruction suggests maintaining order for multiple outputs. The earlier example shows four separate values; similarly, here, we are asked to only identify and extract four specific line items. The description involves four key items, so I will treat \"Selling Expenses\" as the first.\n\nOrder of extraction:\n\n1. Cost to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services --> \"Selling Expenses\"\n2. Financing costs --> \"Financial Expenses\"\n3. Depreciation --> \"Depreciation\"\n4. Taxes --> \"Tax Expense\"\n\nNow, prepare the output.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"1177105.26\", \"value2\": \"372003.12\", \"value3\": \"120970.16\", \"value4\": \"1428630.43\"}}\n```",
