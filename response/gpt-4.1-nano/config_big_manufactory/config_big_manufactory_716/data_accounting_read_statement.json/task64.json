Profit or loss before tax (end value):  \n   From the Income Statement, the line item \"Profit Before Tax\" is `5172748.32`.\n\n2. Addition to the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period:  \n   Credit purchases are generally associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the income statement or increases in accounts payable.  \n   Since the question specifies the addition in the amount owed (accounts payable increase), look at the balance sheet for \"Accounts Payable\" change:  \n   End amount = 6600000.00 (2024-02-05)  \n   Start amount = 0.00 (2023-12-31)  \n   Increase in Accounts Payable = 6600000.00 - 0.00 = 6600000.00\n\n3. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares:  \n   From the balance sheet, \"Paid-in Capital\" = 28000000.00, which is unchanged during the period, but represents the capital contributed by shareholders.\n\n**Step 2: Arrange the outputs group-wise:**\n\n- **Balance Sheet IDs:**\n  - Capital contributed by shareholders: 28000000.00\n- **Income Statement IDs:**\n  - Profit before tax: 5172748.32\n- **Cash Flow Statement IDs:**\n  - Addition to the amount owed (accounts payable): 6600000.00\n\n**Step 3: Format the answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28000000.00', 'value2': '5172748.32', 'value3': '6600000.00'}}\n```\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28000000.00', 'value2': '5172748.32', 'value3': '6600000.00'}}\n```",
