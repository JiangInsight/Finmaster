Here, initial inventory is zero, so purchases must have been 20,200,000 in total, but only 7,400,000 is reported at the end.\n\nTherefore, the inventory sold during the period corresponds to the COGS of 20,200,000.\n\n**Note:** Since the initial inventory was zero and we know the ending inventory, and COGS, it's safe to conclude that the inventory sold is at the value of the COGS, i.e., 20,200,000.  \n\nBut considering the data, the only inventory value presented is 7,400,000 at the end, indicating that purchases during the period were probably at least that much, but the COGS indicates total inventory sold was 20,200,000.\n\nGiven key data, the most precise answer based on the given COGS is:\n\n**Value of inventories sold during the period: 20,200,000.**\n\n**However, note the original question asks for the 'carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period' â€” which is generally represented by the COGS in financial statements.**\n\nHence, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '20200000.00'}}\n```",
