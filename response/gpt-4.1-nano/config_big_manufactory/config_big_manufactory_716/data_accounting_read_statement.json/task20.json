Typically, this is reported under \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS), which represents the carrying amount of inventories that were sold.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Review the provided income statement data.\n2. Identify the line item that explicitly relates to inventories sold.\n3. In standard financial statements, \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (or similar) reflects the carrying amount of inventories sold during the period.\n4. Locate the value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\nFrom the data:\n- \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is listed as 20,200,000.00.\n\nTherefore, the carrying amount of inventories sold during the period is 20,200,000.00.\n\nFinal answer in the required format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"20200000.00\"}}\n```",
