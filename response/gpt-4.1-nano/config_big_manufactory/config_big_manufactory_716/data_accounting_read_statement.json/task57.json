The key account associated with amounts owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit is \"Accounts Payable.\"\n\n2. In the balance sheet, \"Accounts Payable\" changes from an initial amount of 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31) to an end amount of 6,600,000.00 (as of 2024-02-05).\n\n3. The change (increase) in Accounts Payable during the period is:\n\n   6,600,000.00 - 0.00 = 6,600,000.00\n\n4. This increase reflects additional credit purchases or obligations incurred by the entity during the period.\n\nHence, the specific line item is \"Accounts Payable,\" and the value of the addition in the amount owed on credit is 6,600,000.00.\n\n**Note:** The \"Accounts Payable\" line item appears both in the balance sheet and is represented as an increase in the cash flow statement under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable,\" which confirms this is the relevant figure.\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '6600000.00'} }\n```",
