However, this represents the net for all investing activities, not just the reduction of assets held for sale.\n\nUnfortunately, the data does not provide a more specific line item explicitly indicating a sale or reduction of assets held for sale.\n\nGiven typical cash flow presentations, a sale of assets held for sale would usually be reflected as a cash inflow, often under investing activities, labeled accordingly. Since we do not see any such labeled inflow, and considering the question, the most relevant figure reflecting a decrease in such assets would be the net cash flows from investing activities demonstrating asset disposals.\n\n**In this case, the relevant value is the total cash flow from investing activities that indicates reduction, which is -2,479,994.53.**\n\n**Final answer:** The line item is \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with an amount of -2,479,994.53.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-2479994.53\"}}\n```",
