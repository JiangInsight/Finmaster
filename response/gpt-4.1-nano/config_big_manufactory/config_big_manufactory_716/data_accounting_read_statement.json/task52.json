Check the \"Paid-in Capital\" line item at the initial date (2023-12-31): 28,000,000.00\n2. Check the same line item at the end date (2024-02-05): 28,000,000.00\n3. Since this amount remains unchanged over the period, it indicates that the initial capital contributed by shareholders has not changed during this timeframe.\n\nBased on this analysis, the initial and final contributions of shareholders in exchange for shares are both 28,000,000.00.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"28000000.00\", \"end value\": \"28000000.00\"}}\n```",
