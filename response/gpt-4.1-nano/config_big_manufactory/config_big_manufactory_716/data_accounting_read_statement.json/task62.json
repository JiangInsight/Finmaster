Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit: This corresponds to **Accounts Receivable**.\n2. Financing costs incurred by the enterprise to raise funds: This is **Financial Expenses**.\n3. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets: This is **Purchase of Fixed Assets**.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n- **Line item for amounts owed to the entity for goods/services sold on credit:**  \n  From the balance sheet and cash flow statements, the relevant line is **Accounts Receivable**.  \n  - End_amounts are provided for Accounts Receivable in the balance sheet: **14921566.06** and **14921566.06** in the cash flow (decrease in accounts receivable).  \n  - We'll extract the value **14921566.06** since it explicitly represents receivables at the end of the period.\n\n- **Line item for financing costs incurred to raise funds:**  \n  From the income statement, **Financial Expenses** are given as **432511.69** and **372003.12** in the cash flow.  \n  - The end-period value is **432511.69**.  \n  - This is the amount of financing costs incurred.\n\n- **Line item for cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment:**  \n  From the cash flow statement, **Purchase of Fixed Assets** are **305354.43** and **2479994.53** in the cash flow.  \n  - Use the **Purchase of Fixed Assets** value, which is **305354.43** â€” the actual cash paid to acquire property, plant, and equipment (as indicated in the cash flow investing activities).\n\n**Final extracted values:**\n\n- Amounts owed for goods or services (Accounts Receivable): **14921566.06**  \n- Financing costs (Financial Expenses): **432511.69**  \n- Payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment (Purchase of Fixed Assets): **305354.43**\n\nNow, formatting the answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"14921566.06\", \"value2\": \"432511.69\", \"value3\": \"305354.43\"}}\n```",
