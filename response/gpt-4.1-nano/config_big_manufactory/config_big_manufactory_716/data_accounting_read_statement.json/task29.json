In this statement, however, the only explicit revenue component provided is \"Main Business Revenue.\" \n\nGiven the instructions, and since only one sub-item is required:\n   \n- The sub-item for total income (Total Revenue) is \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n\n4. **Extract the initial and final values:**\n\n- For \"Main Business Revenue,\" initial: 28,572,608.70, final: 28,572,608.70\n- For \"Total Revenue,\" initial: 28,572,608.70, final: 28,572,608.70\n\n(Values are the same, confirming that the total income is entirely from Main Business Revenue in this statement.)\n\n**Final answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"28572608.70\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"28572608.70\"}}\n```",
