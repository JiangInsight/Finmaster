The first line item related to credit purchases (amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period) corresponds to \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable,\" which reflects changes in amounts owed for goods or services. \n   - In this case, it is 6,600,000.00.\n\n2. The second line item involves the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment (capital expenditure). This is represented by \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n   - In this case, it is 2,479,994.53.\n\n3. The third line item is the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.\n   - Here, it is 20,000,000.00.\n\nNow, following the original order and details:\n\n- First item: \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": 6,600,000.00\n- Second item: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": 2,479,994.53\n- Third item: \"Beginning Balance\" of cash and cash equivalents: 20,000,000.00\n\nFinal answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"6600000.00\", \"value2\": \"2479994.53\", \"value3\": \"20000000.00\"}}\n```",
