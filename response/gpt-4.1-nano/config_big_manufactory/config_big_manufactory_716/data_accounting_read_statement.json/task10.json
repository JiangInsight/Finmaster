Since the initial and end values of \"Paid-in Capital\" are both the same in this context, it indicates the original amount contributed in exchange for shares has not changed over the period.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify the \"Paid-in Capital\" line item in the balance sheet.\n2. Extract the initial value of \"Paid-in Capital\" at the start.\n3. Extract the final value of \"Paid-in Capital\" at the end.\n4. Since both are the same, the total capital contributed by shareholders remains the same.\n\nIn the provided data:\n- Initial value of Paid-in Capital: 28,000,000.00\n- End value of Paid-in Capital: 28,000,000.00\n\nTherefore, the initial and final capital contributed by shareholders are both 28,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"28000000.00\", \"end value\": \"28000000.00\"}}\n```",
