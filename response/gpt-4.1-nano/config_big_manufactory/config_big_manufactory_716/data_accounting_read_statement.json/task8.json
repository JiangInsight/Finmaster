In typical financial statements, \"Accounts Payable\" is the primary line item that signifies amounts owed to suppliers for credit purchases.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n1. Look for line items related to liabilities for goods or services received or purchased on credit.\n2. The relevant account is \"Accounts Payable.\"\n3. From the data:\n   - Initial value on 2023-12-31: 0.00\n   - End value on 2024-02-05: 6,600,000.00\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe initial value of accounts payable was zero, and the final amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit is 6,600,000.00.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"6600000.00\"}}\n```",
