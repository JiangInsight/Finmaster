But for accounts payable, we need unpaid purchases.\n\n- Unpaid purchases in the second dataset:\n\n  - `Purchase20231231002`: amount = 1,000,000 (Unpaid, as payment method is 'Account Payable', and payment status is 'Unpaid').\n\n  - `Purchase20231231002`: amount = 1,000,000 (Unpaid). \n\n  - `Purchase20231231002`: amount = 500,000 (Unpaid).\n\n- For the first dataset, similarly, initial unpaid purchases:\n\n  - Let's check for unpaid purchase transactions:\n  \n    - `Purchase20231231001`: Paid on 2023-12-31\n   \n    - `Purchase20231231002`: Paid on 2023-12-31\n\n    - `Purchase20231231002` (second occurrence): paid\n\n    - `Purchase20231231003`: paid\n\n    - `Purchase20231231004`: paid\n\n    - `Purchase20231231005`: paid\n\n    - `Purchase20231231006`: paid\n\n    - `Purchase20231231007`: paid\n\n    - `Purchase20231231008`: paid\n\n    - `Purchase20231231009`: paid\n\n    - `Purchase20231231010`: paid\n\n    - `Purchase20231231011`: paid\n\n    - `Purchase20231231012`: unpaid (amount = 1,400,000)\n\n    - `Purchase20231231013`: paid\n\n    - `Purchase20231231014`: paid\n\n    - `Purchase20231231015`: paid\n\n    - `Purchase20231231016`: paid\n\n    - `Purchase20231231017`: paid\n\n    - `Purchase20231231018`: unpaid (amount = 3,000,000)\n\n    - `Purchase20231231019`: paid\n\n    - `Purchase20231231020`: paid\n\n    - `Purchase20231231021`: paid\n\n  So, unpaid purchases at the beginning:\n\n  - From first dataset: 1,400,000 + 3,000,000 = **4,400,000**\n\n  - From second dataset: 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 = **2,500,000**\n\nTotal initial Accounts Payable:\n\n= 4,400,000 + 2,500,000 = **6,900,000**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Final Accounts Payable**\n\n- The final Accounts Payable balance includes the sum of unpaid purchase transactions as of the end of the period.\n\nChecking last transactions:\n\n- In the second dataset, near the end:\n\n  - `Purchase20231231018`: paid\n\n  - `Purchase20231231017`: paid\n\n  - `Purchase20231231016`: paid\n\n  - `Purchase20231231015`: paid\n\n  - `Purchase20231231014`: paid\n\n  - `Purchase20231231013`: paid\n\n  - `Purchase20231231012`: unpaid (amount = 800,000)\n\n  - `Purchase20231231011`: paid\n\n  - `Purchase20231231010`: paid\n\n  - others paid or irrelevant for unpaid amount.\n\nRemaining unpaid as of last record:\n\n- `Purchase20231231012`: 800,000, unpaid as of last date.\n\n- `Purchase20231231018`: 3,000,000 unpaid.\n\nTotal final Accounts Payable = 800,000 + 3,000,000 = **3,800,000**\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Summary**\n\n- Initial accounts payable: sum of unpaid purchases before period = **6,900,000**\n- Final accounts payable: sum of unpaid purchases at the end = **3,800,000**\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"6900000.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"3800000.00\"}}\n```",
