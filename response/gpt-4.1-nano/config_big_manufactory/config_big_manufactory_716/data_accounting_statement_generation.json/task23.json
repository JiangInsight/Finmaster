                        "content": "To determine the cost of goods sold (COGS), we need to sum the cost amounts for all products sold during the period. This involves identifying the \"sale\" transactions and their related \"purchase\" costs, then summing the appropriate cost values.\n\nLet's analyze the provided transaction data:\n\n1. Look for all \"Sale\" transactions.\n2. For each sale, identify the quantity and the product involved.\n3. For each product involved in sales, find the corresponding purchase cost per unit.\n4. Calculate total cost for each sale as: quantity x cost per unit.\n5. Sum these costs across all sales.\n\nGiven the data, focus on sales and associated purchase costs:\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n- Sale20240204039:  \n  *Quantity*: 1.0  \n  *Product*: Heavy
