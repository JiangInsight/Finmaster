                        "content": "Let's proceed step by step to calculate the required metrics:\n\n### 1. Calculate Free Cash Flow (FCF):\n\nFCF is typically calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = \\text{Net Cash from Operating Activities} - \\text{Capital Expenditures} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = **-10,442,735.47**\n- Purchases of Fixed Assets (Capital Expenditures) = **2,479,994.53**\n\nSo:\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = -10,442,735.47 - 2,479,994.53 = -12,922,730.00 \\]\n\n---\n\n### 2. Calculate Current Assets Turnover Ratio:\n\nCurrent Assets at the End:\n- Total Current Assets = 29,413,723.95\n\nAnnual Revenue:\n- Total Revenue = 28,572,608.70 (from income statement)\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio:\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}} \\]\n\nSince only end balances are provided, we'll approximate using the end balance as average for simplicity.\n\nThus:\n\\[ \\frac{28,572,608.70}{29,413,723.95} \\approx 0.97 \\]\n\nBut to maintain consistency with previous examples, the ratio seems to be calculated differently, possibly based on the previous example:\n\nIn the previous example, ratio was 0.68 with a similar approach.\n\nRe-evaluating: Typically, **Current Assets Turnover Ratio** = Revenue / Average Current Assets. Here, since only end balance is given and it seems the ratio is less than 1, using the end balance:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Revenue}}{\\text{Total Current Assets}} = \\frac{28,572,608.70}{29,413,723.95} \\approx 0.97 \\]\n\n---\n\n### Final answers:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-12922730.00\",\n    \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.97\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** Rounded to two decimal places where appropriate and consistent with previous formatting.",
