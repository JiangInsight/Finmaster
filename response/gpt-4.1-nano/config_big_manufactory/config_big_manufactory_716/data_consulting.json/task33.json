Since no long-term debt is provided, we assume total debt is represented by current liabilities.)\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:** Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\n- COGS = 20,200,000.00\n- Beginning Inventory (from previous data, assumed 0 since initial Inventory was 0 and only end inventory provided): 7,400,000.00\n- So, assuming starting inventory was zero:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{20,200,000.00}{7,400,000.00} \\approx 2.73\n\\]\n\n*(Note: Since we only have ending inventory, we can approximate this as 2.73.)*\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Formula:** Total Liabilities / Shareholders' Equity\n\n- Total Liabilities (from current liabilities only, as no long-term debt provided): 8,028,630.43\n- Total Equity: 31,744,117.89\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{8,028,630.43}{31,744,117.89} \\approx 0.25\n\\]\n\n*(Note: Based solely on current liabilities; if total debt included, the ratio could be higher.)*\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Quick Ratio\n\n**Formula:** (Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n\n- Cash + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable:\n\n\\[\n6,057,264.53 + 1,020,005.47 + 14,887.89 + 14,921,566.06 = 21,013,723.95\n\\]\n\n- Current Liabilities: 8,028,630.43\n\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{21,013,723.95}{8,028,630.43} \\approx 2.62\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Current Ratio\n\n**Formula:** Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\n\\[\n\\frac{29,413,723.95}{8,028,630.43} \\approx 3.66\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## Final answers in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.30\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-1.30\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"2.73\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.25\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"2.62\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"3.66\"\n  }\n}\n```",
