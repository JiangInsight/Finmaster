Given the data, we'll assume \"Total Liabilities\" is represented by total current liabilities for this calculation.\n\n**Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets**\n\n= 8,028,630.43 / 39,772,748.32\n\n≈ 0.2018 or 20.18%\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Gross Profit Margin**\n\n- Gross Profit from income statement = 8,372,608.70\n- Total Revenue = 28,572,608.70\n\n**Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100**\n\n= (8,372,608.70 / 28,572,608.70) * 100\n\n≈ 0.293 or 29.3%\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Operating Cash Flow Ratio**\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -10,442,735.47\n- Total Liabilities (current liabilities) = 8,028,630.43\n\n**Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities / Total Liabilities**\n\n= -10,442,735.47 / 8,028,630.43\n\n≈ -1.30\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Calculations:**\n- Debt to Asset Ratio ≈ 20.18%\n- Gross Profit Margin ≈ 29.30%\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio ≈ -1.30\n\n---\n\n**Final answer in required JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.20\", \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"29.30%\", \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.30\"}}\n```",
