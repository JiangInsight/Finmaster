Current Liabilities (CL)\n\n**Step 1: Find Operating Cash Flow**\n\nFrom the cash flow statement of the second problem:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -10,442,735.47\n\n**Step 2: Find Current Liabilities**\n\nFrom the balance sheet of the second problem:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the ratio**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-10,442,735.47}{8,028,630.43} \\approx -1.30\n\\]\n\nThe ratio indicates the cash flow generated from operations relative to current liabilities. Since the flow is negative, it suggests the companyâ€™s operating cash flows are insufficient to cover its current liabilities.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.30\"}}\n```",
