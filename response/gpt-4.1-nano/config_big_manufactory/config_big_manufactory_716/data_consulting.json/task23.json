From the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43\n- We only have current liabilities; no information on long-term liabilities is provided, so we will consider total liabilities as current liabilities for this calculation.\n\nTotal Debt = 8,028,630.43\n\n3. **Compute the ratio:**\n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\n= -10,442,735.47 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ -1.30\n\nExpressed as a ratio, it is approximately -1.30.\n\n---\n\n### Final Result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"29.33%\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-1.30\"\n  }\n}\n```",
