The total debt (usually represented by total liabilities).\n\n**Step 1: Extract Data**\n\nFrom the cash flow statement, the net cash flow from operating activities is given as:\n\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -10,442,735.47\n\nFrom the balance sheet, the total liabilities (current liabilities plus any long-term liabilities) need to be considered.\n\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 8,028,630.43\n- **Total Liabilities:** Since not explicitly given separately, and given the structure, total liabilities generally include current liabilities plus non-current liabilities, but the total liabilities can generally be inferred from the total liabilities and equity side.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet:\n\n- Total liabilities can be roughly estimated as Total Assets minus Owner's Equity.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Total Assets: 39,772,748.32\n- Total Owner's Equity: 31,744,117.89\n\nTherefore:\n**Total Liabilities = Total Assets - Total Owner's Equity = 39,772,748.32 - 31,744,117.89 = 8,028,630.43**\n\nThis matches the total current liabilities, indicating no separate non-current liabilities are provided, so total liabilities = 8,028,630.43.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{-10,442,735.47}{8,028,630.43}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[\n= -1.30 \\quad \\text{(approximate)}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Format the answer**\n\nRounded to two decimal places: -1.30\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.30'} }\n```",
