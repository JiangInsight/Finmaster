The key data points are:\n   - Net profit: 3,744,117.89\n   - Depreciation: 120,970.16\n   - Changes in working capital components:\n     - Accounts receivable: -14,921,566.06\n     - Interest receivable: -14,887.89\n     - Inventory: -7,400,000.00\n     - Accounts payable: 6,600,000.00\n     - Tax payable: 1,428,630.43\n\n2. The net cash flow from operating activities is already provided as:\n   - Net cash flow from operating activities: -10,442,735.47\n\n3. The cash flow from investing activities is:\n   - Purchase of fixed assets: 2,479,994.53 (outflow)\n   - Net cash flow from investing activities: -2,479,994.53\n\n4. The Free Cash Flow (FCF) is calculated as:\n   \n   FCF = Net cash flow from operating activities + Net cash flow from investing activities\n\n5. Plugging in the numbers:\n   \n   FCF = -10,442,735.47 + (-2,479,994.53) = -12,922,730.00\n\nNote: Alternatively, if we wanted to reconstruct the calculation from scratch using the components, we would add back depreciation and account for changes in working capital, but since the net cash flow from operating activities is provided directly, and investing cash flows are also provided, the simplest accurate calculation is the sum of these two, which yields the Free Cash Flow.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-12922730.00\"}}\n```",
