Given the second dataset is more comprehensive and shows the initial fixed asset value as 8,000,000, which matches the overall initial fixed assets.\n\nAlso note, the most recent purchase of heavy machinery and equipment has been added.\n\nThe last fixed asset value as of the latest date is the sum of assets minus depreciation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Initial fixed assets value:** 8,000,000.00\n- **Latest fixed assets value:** approximately 8,361,161.25 + 305,354.43 + 886,161.25 + 839,853.83 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 839,853.83 - accumulated depreciation**\n\nIn the latest data, the last mentioned fixed asset value was:\n\n- 839,853.83 (the last listed purchase)\n- The sum of fixed assets purchased in recent transactions (more refined data):\n\n  Total fixed assets end value:\n\n  From the most recent \"Fixed Asset Purchase\" entries:\n\n  - 839,853.83\n  - 305,354.43\n  - 886,161.25\n\nSum: 839,853.83 + 305,354.43 + 886,161.25 = 2,031,369.51\n\nAdding the initial 8,000,000.00 gives a total of 10,031,369.51. But in the initial fixed asset value, the total was 8,000,000 + recent additions.\n\nThe most recent fixed asset value listed (in the last data set):\n\n- 839,853.83 (last purchase)\n\nAdd all fixed assets:\n\n- From most recent: 839,853.83\n- Plus earlier fixed assets: 8,000,000 + 305,354.43 + 886,161.25 (from the first dataset)\n\nSum:\n\n8,000,000 + 305,354.43 + 886,161.25 + 839,853.83 = 10,031,369.51\n\nAdjusting for depreciation (sum of depreciation expenses in 2024):\n\n- 45,751.41 + 45,745.88 + 60,147.44 + 45,751.41 = 197,396.14 total depreciation.\n\nSubtract depreciation:\n\n10,031,369.51 - 197,396.14 ≈ **9,833,973.37**\n\nGiven the data, the most straightforward approach is:\n\n- **Initial fixed assets:** 8,000,000.00 (most reliable starting point)\n- **Final fixed assets:** sum of latest purchase and previous fixed assets minus depreciation.\n\nBased on the latest listed fixed assets latest purchase:\n\n- Latest fixed asset purchase: 839,853.83\n\nAdding up:\n\n- Initial: 8,000,000.00\n- Purchases: 839,853.83 (latest) + previous acquisitions\n\nFrom the total purchases:\n\n- 305,354.43\n- 886,161.25\n- 839,853.83\n\nTotal acquisitions in the period:\n\n305,354.43 + 886,161.25 + 839,853.83 ≈ 2,031,369.51\n\nSum of assets before depreciation:\n\n8,000,000 + 2,031,369.51 ≈ 10,031,369.51\n\nSubtract total depreciation accumulated over the period:\n\n- 45,751.41 + 45,745.88 + 60,147.44 = 151,644.73\n\nTotal fixed assets net:\n\n10,031,369.51 - 151,644.73 ≈ **9,879,724.78**\n\nFor the purpose of the answer, matching the example format, I will round the final figures.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n- **Initial fixed assets value:** 8,000,000.00\n- **Final fixed assets value:** 9,879,725.00 (rounded)\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Fixed Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Fixed Assets End Value': '9879725.00'}}\n```",
