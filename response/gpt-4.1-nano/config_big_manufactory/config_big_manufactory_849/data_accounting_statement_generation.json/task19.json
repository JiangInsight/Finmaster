This suggests the total liabilities and owner’s equity (including changes and transactions) summed up as per the dataset is **13216409.49**.\n\n---\n\n### Dataset 2:\n**Initial Liabilities and Owner’s Equity:**\n- Cash deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: 15,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.00\n\nSum:\n= 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = **28,000,000**\n\nThe dataset states the total initial value for liabilities and owner’s equity as **13,000,000**. The initial values being recorded are the assets, but for the purposes of liability and owner's equity, initial total likely equals their sum plus initial liabilities.\n\n**Final total liabilities and owner’s equity (as per latest record):**  \nSummed in the last record of dataset 2, the total is **13,216,409.49**, corresponding to the last entry.\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\n\n- The initial total liabilities and owner's equity: Both datasets' initial values are approximately **13,000,000** (dataset 2 explicitly).\n- The final total liabilities and owner's equity: Dataset 1 and 2's latest total are **13216409.49** accordingly.\n\n**Note:** Since the datasets seem to give totals directly, I'll take the initial as roughly **13,000,000** (dataset 2 explicitly) and the final explicitly as **13216409.49**.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value': '13216409.49'}}\n```",
