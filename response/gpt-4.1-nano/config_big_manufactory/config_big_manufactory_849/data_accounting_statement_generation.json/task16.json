The transactions consist mostly of purchases, sales, expenses, and receivables, with some fixed assets purchases.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the final paid-in capital**\n\nSince there are no records indicating any capital withdrawal or additional capital input beyond the initial contribution, the final amount of paid-in capital would be the same as the initial amount unless there's evidence to suggest otherwise.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nBoth datasets suggest that the company's paid-in capital remained unchanged at **28,000,000** throughout the period.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '28000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '28000000.00'} }\n```",
