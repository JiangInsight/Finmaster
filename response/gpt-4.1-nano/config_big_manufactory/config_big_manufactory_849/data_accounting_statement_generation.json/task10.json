The provided balances and purchase records seem cumulative.\n\nIn the second dataset, the total \"Fixed Assets\" balance is explicitly given as **8,861,161.25 + 886,161.25 + 839,853.83 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 16,607,329.19**\n\nAlternatively, the balance on the last record also provides a cumulative value after cumulative purchases, but the balancing should be done via the recorded balances.\n\nThe last total asset value provided is: **839,853.83** (from latest fixed asset purchase record), but note the record \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" with 839,853.83 was made multiple times, so the cumulative balance considering all these should be tallied.\n\n### Step 4: Final estimation\nThe initial assets sum: **14,701,015.08**\n\nThe recorded total fixed assets at end, as per the last explicit record, is **839,853.83** for the latest purchase, but total cumulative fixed assets account for all acquisitions.\n\nSum of last known fixed assets (from the balances):\n- 14,701,015.08 (initial)\n- + summation of all new fixed asset additions:\n  - 886,161.25\n  - 839,853.83\n  - 1,500,000.00\n  - 1,000,000.00\n  - 500,000.00\n  - 1,000,000.00\n  - 1,000,000.00\n  - 1,500,000.00\n  - 1,000,000.00\n  - 500,000.00\n  - 1,000,000.00\n  - 1,500,000.00\n- Sum of added assets:\n  886,161.25 + 839,853.83 + 1,500,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 = **13,726,868.91**\n\nTotal fixed assets at end:\n14,701,015.08 + 13,726,868.91 = **28,427,883.99**\n\n### Step 5: Final answer\n**Initial non-current assets balance**: sum of initial fixed assets (first dataset): **5,000,000 + 8,861,161.25 + 839,853.83 = 14,701,015.08**\n\n**Final non-current assets balance**: sum of initial plus all subsequent purchases:\n- Initial: 14,701,015.08\n- Add: all acquisition costs from second dataset (total of assets purchased): 13,726,868.91\n= **28,427,883.99**\n\n### Step 6: Round to two decimals and prepare output\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"14,701,015.08\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"28,427,883.99\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"14,701,015.08\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"28,427,883.99\"}}\n```",
