From the given data, **Total Revenue** is the sum of income components generated by the entityâ€™s main business operations.\n3. According to the structure of the income statement, the total income is **Total Revenue**.\n4. The sub-item we need to decompose is a component of Total Revenue. Typically, in an income statement, the primary sub-component under revenue is **Main Business Revenue**.\n\nBased on the provided data:\n\n- **Total Revenue** is 16,388,736.33\n- The main component (or sub-item) that makes up Total Revenue is **Main Business Revenue**, which is also 16,388,736.33.\n\nThe initial and final values for the sub-item are both 16,388,736.33, indicating the entire total revenue originates from this single sub-item.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"16388736.33\", \"sub_item value\": \"16388736.33\"}}\n```",
