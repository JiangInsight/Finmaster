                        "content": "To determine the capitalization contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares, we need to identify the relevant line items in the financial statements that represent initial and final contributions of equity (capital stock). Typically, these are represented in the \"Paid-in Capital\" or \"Share Capital\" line items in the balance sheet.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify paid-in capital or share capital line items:**\n   - Both balance sheets include a line called \"Paid-in Capital.\"\n   \n2. **Extract initial and end values:**\n   - From the initial date (2023-12-31), the \"Paid-in Capital\" is 28,000,000.00.\n   - From the end date (2024-02-05), the \"Paid-in Capital\" remains the same at 28,000,000.00.\n\n3. **Determine if there was any change:**\n   - There is no change in \"Paid-in Capital,\" indicating no new capital was contributed during this period.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The initial contribution (capital contributed by shareholders at the start) equals 28,000,000.00.\n   - The final value remains the same at 28,000,000.00.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and its value for the contribution by shareholders are \"Paid-in Capital\" with initial and final values as above.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '28000000.00', 'end value': '28000000.00'}}\n```",
