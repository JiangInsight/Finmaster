                        "content": "To identify the assets held for sale, we examine the line items related to assets in the accounting records, focusing on those that are in the process of being sold, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured.\n\nIn both given data sets, the relevant asset line items are typically \"Inventory\" and possibly \"Fixed Assets,\" but assets held for sale are most often classified under \"Assets Held for Sale\" or similar. Since the provided data do not explicitly label any line item as \"Assets Held for Sale,\" the focus is on inventory that is specifically identified as being for sale.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. Look at the \"Inventory\" line item:\n   - In the first dataset, Inventory increased from 0.00 to 5,090,000.00.\n   - In the second dataset, Inventory increased from 0.00 to 5,600,000.00.\n\n2. Since inventory represents assets that are in production, in the process of being manufactured, or held for sale in the ordinary course of business, these are the assets relevant to this task.\n\n3. The problem asks for initial and final values of such assets. Given the data, the initial value for inventory was zero, and the final value is the latest \"End_amount\" figure provided.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n- For the first dataset: initial value = 0.00, final value = 5,090,000.00\n- For the second dataset: initial value = 0.00, final value = 5,600,000.00\n\nSince only one such line item per dataset is asked and the general approach is consistent, I will format the answer based on the second dataset as per the problem statement.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '5600000.00'} }\n```",
