Identify the relevant line items:  \n   The line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Payable\" indicates changes in the amount owed for goods or services purchased on credit. An increase signifies additional credit purchases leading to an increase in liabilities.\n\n2. Find the value of this change:  \n   From the data, the \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Payable\" is **3500000.00**.\n\n3. Confirm the significance:  \n   Since this is an increase, it reflects new credit purchases and the addition to the amount owed during the period.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and its value are the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" at **3500000.00**.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3500000.00'}}\n```",
