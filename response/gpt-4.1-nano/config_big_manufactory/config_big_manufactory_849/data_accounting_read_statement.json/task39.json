                        "content": "Let's analyze the cash flow statement provided to identify any line item related to a reduction in the amount of assets held for sale, or assets in the process of being manufactured for sale.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Review each line item:\n   - Cash Flow From Operating Activities: Not relevant.\n   - Net Profit: Not relevant.\n   - Depreciation: Not relevant.\n   - Changes in receivables, inventory, payables, tax payable: Not relevant.\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: Not relevant.\n   \n2. Cash Flow from Investing Activities:\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: This refers to acquiring fixed assets, not assets held for sale.\n   - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: Summarizes investing activities, no direct link to assets held for sale.\n   \n3. Look for entries that speak about assets held for sale:\n   - The problem asks specifically about a *reduction in the amount of assets held for sale* in the ordinary course of business, or assets in the process of being manufactured or in production for such sale.\n\n4. In the data:\n   - The relevant asset-related line item would be labeled with something indicating sale assets or assets in production for sale.\n   \n5. Examination:\n   - The provided table does not explicitly mention \"assets held for sale\" or \"assets in process of sale.\" The only relevant line that indicates a decrease in assets related to assets possibly intended for sale is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which is an investment, not a sale or reduction.\n\n6. Since the question focuses on reductions in assets held for sale in the period, and this data lacks any explicit line referring to such reductions, but based on prior understanding and typical accounting entries, reductions in assets held for sale are often realized through sales, which would typically be recorded as proceeds or reductions.\n\n7. Alternatively, sometimes, reductions in assets held for sale are reflected as an \"Assets Held for Sale\" line item, or similar, but this is not explicitly present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The only asset-related line showing a reduction from the assets in the previous period is the \"Ending Balance\" of cash in the context of the assets, but there is no explicit entry indicating assets held for sale reduction.\n\n**However:**  \nGiven the task, and if we consider that the decrease in assets held for sale relates indirectly to the movement in assets, then:\n\n- The only specific number related to assets reduction could be the change from Beginning to Ending Balance of cash or inventory.  \n- The larger decrease in inventory (5600000.00) could relate to assets in production moving out of inventory, but not necessarily assets held for sale.\n\n**Important Point:**  \nThe question asks for the *specific line items and value* of *reduction* of assets held for sale. Since there is **no explicit line item** about assets held for sale, the answer should be the **value associated with the biggest reduction in inventory** or assets related to assets in production.\n\n**But based on standard accounting:**\n\n- Assets held for sale could be represented under assets in inventory intended for sale.\n- The reduction in inventory (5600000.00) suggests assets moved out of inventory, possibly as assets held for sale.\n\n**Therefore:**\n\nThe identified reduction value would be the value of the inventory decreased, which is **-5600000.00**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-5600000.00\"}}\n```",
