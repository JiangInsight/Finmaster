Income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities: This is typically represented by \"Main Business Revenue\" or similar, which indicates the core income from operations.\n\n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period: This is generally listed as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" or similar, representing the inventory costs associated with sales.\n\nLooking at the provided data:\n\n- The first relevant line item is \"Main Business Revenue\" with amount 16,388,736.33.\n- The second relevant line item is \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with amount 11,600,000.00.\n\nThe instruction also says to maintain the original line item order, which in this case is first \"Main Business Revenue\" then \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n\nTherefore, the answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16388736.33', 'value2': '11600000.00'}}\n```",
