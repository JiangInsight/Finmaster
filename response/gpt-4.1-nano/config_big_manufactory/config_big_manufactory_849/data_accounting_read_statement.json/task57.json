Initial \"Accounts Payable\" amount: 0.00 (on 2023-12-31)\n2. End \"Accounts Payable\" amount: 3,500,000.00 (on 2024-02-05)\n3. The change (addition) in Accounts Payable = End amount - Initial amount = 3,500,000.00 - 0.00 = 3,500,000.00\n\nThis increase in Accounts Payable represents the new amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and value are:\n{\"value\": \"3500000.00\"}\n\nFinal answer in required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3500000.00'} }\n```",
