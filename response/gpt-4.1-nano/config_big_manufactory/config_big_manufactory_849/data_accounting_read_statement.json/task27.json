                        "content": "To identify the specific line item related to the accumulated systematic allocation of the depreciable amount over its useful life, we need to focus on depreciation expenses recorded in the income statement.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Look for line items that directly refer to depreciation or amortization, typically labeled as \"Depreciation\" or similar.\n2. The amount associated with this line item is the depreciation expense for the period.\n3. Since we are asked for the accumulated systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset (i.e., total depreciation recognized to date), in a typical income statement, unless otherwise specified, the line \"Depreciation\" usually indicates the current period's depreciation expense.\n4. The accumulated depreciation (total depreciation over the asset’s useful life up to the reporting date) is often assets’ \"accumulated depreciation\" on the balance sheet. However, in the income statement, only the current period’s depreciation expense is explicitly stated unless it's summarized elsewhere.\n   \nGiven the context, the question most likely asks for the line item that records the annual (or current period) depreciation expense, which is \"Depreciation\".\n\nIn this income statement, the depreciation expense is:\n\n- Amount: 105893.32\n- Line item: \"Depreciation\"\n\nHence, the specific line item value of the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount over its useful life is 105,893.32.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"105893.32\"}}\n```",
