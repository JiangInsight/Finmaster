Value 1 (Depreciation): **105893.32**  \n2. Value 2 (Reduction in assets held for sale or in process): **-5600000.00**  \n3. Value 3 (Cash flows from acquisitions/disposals, investments, etc.): **-1726015.08**  \n4. Value 4 (Net change in cash and equivalents): **-8042420.52**\n\n---\n\n**Final answer in the required JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"105893.32\", \"value2\": \"-5600000.00\", \"value3\": \"-1726015.08\", \"value4\": \"-8042420.52\"}}\n```",
