Accounts like \"Inventory\" are also tangible, but they represent stock for sale or production, which may or may not be specifically held for administrative use; however, generally, \"Inventory\" is classified separately from fixed tangible assets used in operations.\n\nStep 5: For clarity and based on typical accounting classifications, the relevant line item is \"Fixed Assets.\"\n\nFinal answer: The initial and end values of \"Fixed Assets\" are the figures to report.\n\nAnswer in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '9726015.08'}}\n```",
