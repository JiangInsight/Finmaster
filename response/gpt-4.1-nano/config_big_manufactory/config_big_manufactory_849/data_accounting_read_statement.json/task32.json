The specific line item we are interested in is **Net Profit**, which is the amount of profit retained after all expenses, taxes, interest, depreciation, etc., have been deducted.\n\n2. From the provided data:\n   - Total Revenue = 16,388,736.33\n   - Total Expenses include:\n     - Cost of Goods Sold = 11,600,000.00\n     - Administrative Expenses = 738,427.41\n     - Selling Expenses = 1,334,099.97\n     - Depreciation = 105,893.32\n     - Financial Expenses = 523,627.32\n     - Total Expenses = 2,702,048.02\n   - Other relevant figures:\n     - Interest Income = 23,583.67\n     - Tax Expense = 819,436.82\n   - Profit Before Tax = 2,110,271.98\n   - Net Profit = 1,290,835.16\n\n3. The net profit here (after all deductions including tax) is **1,290,835.16**.\n\n4. Next, decompose this net profit into 5 components originating from the input statement. Based on typical income statement components:\n\n   - Revenue (from total revenue)\n   - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\n   - Total Expenses (aggregate of expenses before tax)\n   - Interest Income (income component)\n   - Tax Expense (deduction component)\n\nLet's assign initial and final values accordingly:\n\n- Income from Total Revenue: 16,388,736.33\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 11,600,000.00\n- Total Expenses (before tax): 2,702,048.02 (includes operating and financial expenses)\n- Interest Income: 23,583.67\n- Tax Expense: 819,436.82\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"value\": \"1290835.16\",\n  \"sub_items_sub_item1\": \"16388736.33\",  // Total Revenue\n  \"sub_items_sub_item2\": \"11600000.00\", // Cost of Goods Sold\n  \"sub_items_sub_item3\": \"2702048.02\",  // Total Expenses\n  \"sub_items_sub_item4\": \"23583.67\",    // Interest Income\n  \"sub_items_sub_item5\": \"819436.82\"    // Tax Expense\n}}\n```",
