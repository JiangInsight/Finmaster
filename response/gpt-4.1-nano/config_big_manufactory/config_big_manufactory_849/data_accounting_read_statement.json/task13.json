Review the provided balance sheet data.\n2. Identify total assets, including current and non-current (long-term) assets.\n3. Focus on non-current assets, which are generally not expected to be realized or consumed within the normal operating cycle.\n4. Within non-current assets, distinguish the initial and ending values for the relevant line items.\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- Total non-current assets are listed as \"Fixed Assets\" with initial amount of 8,000,000.00 and ending amount of 9,726,015.08.\n- Accumulated depreciation (not a separate asset but a contra asset) is also listed, but it is not an asset itself to be realized.\n- For assets not intended for sale or consumption, **fixed assets** are typically long-term assets that are not expected to be liquidated within the operating cycle unless explicitly stated.\n\nTherefore, the relevant line item is \"Fixed Assets.\"\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"9726015.08\"}}\n```",
