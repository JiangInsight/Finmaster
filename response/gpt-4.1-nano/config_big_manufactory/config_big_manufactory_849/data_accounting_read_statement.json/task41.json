Since the problem refers to the \"amount of increase,\" the positive figures are relevant.\n\nStep 4: Finalize the value:\n- The instruction does not specify cumulative or selective; generally, we would output the amount corresponding directly to the increase in tax payable.\n\nGiven the pattern and example, the value to report should be the latest or the most significant increase in tax accrued but not paid, which is 819,436.82 from the second data set.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '819436.82'}}\n```",
