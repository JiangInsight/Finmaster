This represents the current tax liability at the reporting date.\n- In the cash flow statement, the line \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" shows an increase of 819,436.82, consistent with the amount in the balance sheet.\n- In the income statement, there is a line \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of 819,436.82, indicating the tax cost for the period.\n\nStep 2: Determine whether the total expected tax to pay or recover during the period is the tax expense or the change in the tax payable.\n\n- The \"Tax Expense\" of 819,436.82 pertains to the taxes incurred during the period, which the company expects to pay.\n- The \"Taxes Payable\" amount at the end of the period also reflects the tax liabilities due.\n\nSince both the \"Tax Expense\" and \"Taxes Payable\" amount are the same (819,436.82), and the problem asks for the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay or recover, the most relevant figure for the total expected tax payable during the period is the \"Tax Expense\" as it indicates the tax cost recognized for this period.\n\nFinal answer: 819,436.82\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"819436.82\"}}\n```",
