                        "content": "First, let's identify each of the three specified line items from the given data:\n\n1. **Profit or loss before deducting tax expense**  \n   From the Income Statement, this is typically labeled as \"Profit Before Tax.\"  \n   In the first income statement, it is \"-1373590.51\"; in the second, \"2110271.98.\"  \n   The problem states \"before deducting tax expense,\" so pick the \"Profit Before Tax\" value:  \n   - For first, `-1373590.51`  \n   - For second, `2110271.98`  \n   Since the task wants a single output, we need to decide which statement to consider. The problem provides multiple statements but expects a combined result.  \n   Based on the instructions, we should process the data similarly, extracting the relevant value from each statement, and perhaps outputting the value that corresponds with the provided data example. Given the instructions, the expected output seems to be the \"Profit Before Tax\" from the income statement.\n\n2. **Addition in the amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**  \n   This is typically reflected in \"Accounts Payable\" changes, or the increase in liabilities related to purchases on credit.  \n   From the balance sheet, \"Accounts Payable\" change from initial to end also indicates this.  \n   - For first: 0.00 to 1,590,000.00 → increase of 1,590,000.00  \n   - For second: 0.00 to 3,500,000.00 → increase of 3,500,000.00  \n   The snippets in the cash flow also show \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable,\" which is consistent. The task specifies \"during the period,\" so the change in Accounts Payable (end - initial).\n\n3. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**  \n   This is represented by \"Paid-in Capital\" in the balance sheet.  \n   - For first: 13,000,000.00 (no change)  \n   - For second: 28,000,000.00 (no change)  \n   The instructions also specify grouping, but the example output shows three values, so the last value corresponds to \"Paid-in Capital.\"\n\n**Now, selecting the values:**\n\n- For the **profit/loss before tax**: take the \"Profit Before Tax\" from the income statement.  \n  The second income statement shows **2110271.98**.\n\n- For **increase in liabilities for goods/services received on credit**:  \n  Change in \"Accounts Payable\" from initial to end:  \n  0.00 to 3,500,000.00, which is **3,500,000.00**.\n\n- For **capital contributed by shareholders**:  \n  From \"Paid-in Capital\" in the balance sheet: **28,000,000.00**.\n\n**Final output in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"2110271.98\", \"value2\": \"3500000.00\", \"value3\": \"28000000.00\"}}\n```\n\nThis corresponds with extracting the relevant financial statement line items as requested.",
