Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\nFrom the given data:\n\n- The costs to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services typically appear as selling and administrative expenses (or related costs) on the income statement, as they relate to selling and general operations.\n- The cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment are reflected in the cash flow statement under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nStep-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify cost to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services:**\n   - From the income statement, \"Selling Expenses\" and \"Administrative Expenses\" include costs associated with securing and delivering customer orders.\n   - The relevant line item here is **Selling Expenses** (since it directly relates to delivering goods/services and possibly securing orders) and possibly \"Administrative Expenses\" as well.\n   - The example provided in the initial template shows \"Selling Expenses\" with a value of 493854.67, which aligns with costs for selling activities.\n\n2. **Identify cash payments for property, plant, and equipment:**\n   - From the cash flow statement, \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" shows the cash outflow related to acquiring long-term assets.\n   - The value given is 305354.43 in the first problem example and 1726015.08 in the second. So, the relevant line item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nFinal selection based on the data:\n\n- For the first item (costs to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services), \"Selling Expenses\" is most appropriate.\n- For the second item (cash payments for property, plant, and equipment), \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is correct.\n\nAnswer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '493854.67', 'value2': '1726015.08'}}\n```",
