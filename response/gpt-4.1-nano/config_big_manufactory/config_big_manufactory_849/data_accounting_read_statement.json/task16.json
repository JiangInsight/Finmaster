Total Liabilities: sum of \"Total Current Liabilities\" (initial and end)  \n2. Total Owner's Equity: sum of \"Total Owner's Equity\" (initial and end)\n\nFrom the data:\n- Total Liabilities initial: 0.00 (since \"Total Current Liabilities\" was 0.00 initially but the overall total liabilities are embedded in the total, for decomposition, we consider the total liabilities as the sum of specific liabilities)  \n- Total Liabilities end: 4,319,436.82  \n- Total Owner's Equity initial: 28,000,000.00  \n- Total Owner's Equity end: 29,290,835.16\n\nHowever, as per the structure, the liabilities are represented by \"Total Current Liabilities,\" and the equity by \"Total Owner's Equity.\"\n\nThus, the sub-items are:\n- Initial liabilities: 0.00  \n- Final liabilities: 4,319,436.82  \n- Initial equity: 28,000,000.00  \n- Final equity: 29,290,835.16\n\nNow, formulating the JSON answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"initial value\": \"28000000.00\",\n    \"end value\": \"33610271.98\",\n    \"sub_items_initial sub_item value1\": \"0.00\",\n    \"sub_items_end sub_item value1\": \"4319436.82\",\n    \"sub_items_initial sub_item value2\": \"28000000.00\",\n    \"sub_items_end sub_item value2\": \"29290835.16\"\n  }\n}\n```",
