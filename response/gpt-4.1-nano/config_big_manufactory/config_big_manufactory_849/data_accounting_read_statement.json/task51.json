Specifically, we look for \"Interest Receivable,\" which represents interest accrued but not yet received at the initial and final dates.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Initial value of Interest Receivable at the start of the period: Given directly as 0.00.\n2. Final value of Interest Receivable at the end of the period: Given as 23,583.67.\n3. This line item captures the accrued interest not yet received during the period.\n\nTherefore, the initial value is 0.00, and the final value is 23,583.67.\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"23583.67\"}}\n```",
