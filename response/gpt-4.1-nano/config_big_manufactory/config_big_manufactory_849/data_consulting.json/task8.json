                        "content": "To calculate the Net Cash Ratio, we need to understand what the ratio represents. Typically, the Net Cash Ratio measures the company's net cash position relative to its total assets or other relevant total, but since the problem specifically references the cash flow statement and provides balances, it is often interpreted as:\n\n**Net Cash Ratio** = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Beginning Cash & Equivalents)\n\nor sometimes as the net change in cash compared to the beginning cash balance.\n\nGiven the data, the most straightforward approach based on available figures appears to be:\n\n**Net Cash Ratio** = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Beginning Balance of Cash & Equivalents\n\nLet's check the provided data:\n\n- For 2024-02-05:\n  - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,316,405.44\n  - Beginning Balance (Cash & Cash Equivalents) = 20,000,000.00\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\nNet Cash Ratio = -6,316,405.44 / 20,000,000.00 â‰ˆ -0.31582\n\nExpressed as a percentage: -31.58%\n\n---\n\n### Final step:\n\nPresent the answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Ratio': '-31.58'}}\n```\n\n**Note:** Since the previous example shows the ratio rounded to two decimal places, I will follow the same rounding.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Ratio': '-31.58'}}\n```",
