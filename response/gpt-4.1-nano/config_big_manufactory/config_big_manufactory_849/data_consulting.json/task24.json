Calculate Total Debt (Liabilities):**\n\nFrom the balance sheet, total liabilities include:\n\n- Accounts Payable: 3,500,000.00\n- Taxes Payable: 819,436.82\n\nTotal Liabilities = 3,500,000 + 819,436.82 = **4,319,436.82**\n\n---\n\n**2. Calculate Total Assets:**\n\nAlready given as:\n\n- End of period Total Assets = 33,610,271.98\n\n---\n\n**3. Calculate Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{4,319,436.82}{33,610,271.98} \\approx 0.1285\n\\]\n\nExpressed as a percentage: approximately **12.85%**.\n\n---\n\n**4. Calculate Net Cash (Cash and Cash Equivalents):**\n\nFrom balance sheet:\n\n- Cash on Hand = 9,383,594.56\n- Bank Deposits = 2,573,984.92\n\nTotal Cash and Cash Equivalents = 9,383,594.56 + 2,573,984.92 = **11,957,579.48**\n\n---\n\n**5. Calculate Operating Cash Flow (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities):**\n\nFrom cash flow statement:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,316,405.44\n\nNote that this is a negative cash flow, but since we are asked for Net Cash Ratio, which typically refers to the ratio of cash and cash equivalents to total assets, using the ending cash balance is more direct.\n\n---\n\n**6. Calculate Net Cash Ratio:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{11,957,579.48}{33,610,271.98} \\approx 0.3557\n\\]\n\nExpressed as a percentage: approximately **35.57%**.\n\n---\n\n### Final answers:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.13\", \"Net Cash Ratio\": \"0.36\"}}\n```\n\n(Slight rounding to two decimal places.)",
