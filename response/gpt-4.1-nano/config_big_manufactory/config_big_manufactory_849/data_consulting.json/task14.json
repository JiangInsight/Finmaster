                        "content": "Let's proceed step by step to calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio for the given problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the formula for Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio.**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n\\]\n\nIn typical analysis, net credit sales are approximated by total revenue if the entire sales are on credit, unless specified otherwise. Here, the income statement provides total revenue (Main Business Revenue). We will assume that all revenue is on credit for this calculation.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the period for the calculation.**\n\nSince the data is for a period from December 31, 2023, to February 5, 2024, roughly 36 days, but for simplicity and standard practice, we use an annualized ratio based on the accounts receivable data. We can calculate for an actual period, but most ratios are annualized. \n\nGiven the data, let's proceed with the ratio based on the period:\n\n- Total revenue over the period: From the income statement, the revenue during this period is approximately 16,388,736.33.\n\n- The average Accounts Receivable: \n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{\\text{Initial Accounts Receivable} + \\text{End Accounts Receivable}}{2}\n\\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n\n- Initial (Dec 31, 2023): 0.00\n- End (Feb 5, 2024): 6,408,987.07\n\nSince initial is zero, average is simply:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0 + 6,408,987.07}{2} = 3,204,493.54\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio.**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \n= \\frac{16,388,736.33}{3,204,493.54} \\approx 5.12\n\\]\n\nNote: Since the period is less than a year, this ratio reflects the receivables turnover over that period; however, these ratios are typically annualized. To annualize, we'd adjust:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Annualized Ratio} = \\frac{365}{\\text{Number of days in period}} \\times 5.12\n\\]\n\nNumber of days in period: Dec 31, 2023 to Feb 5, 2024 is 36 days.\n\nAnnualized:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{365}{36} \\times 5.12 \\approx 10.40\n\\]\n\nBut generally, unless specified, the ratio as calculated over the period is acceptable.\n\n**Final step: Present the answer in the required format.**\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"5.12\"}}\n```",
