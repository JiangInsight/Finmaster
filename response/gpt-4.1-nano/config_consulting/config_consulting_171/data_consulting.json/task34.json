                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided data step-by-step to compute each ratio:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n- Operating Cash Flow from cash flow statement: **-862,455.97**\n- Current Liabilities (from balance sheet): **624,988.48**\n\nCalculation:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities} = \\frac{-862,455.97}{624,988.48} \\approx -1.38\n\\]\nInterpretation: Since the cash flow is negative, the ratio is approximately **-1.38**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n- Total liabilities = Total current liabilities + any non-current liabilities (none explicitly given; assume all liabilities are current)\n- From balance sheet:\n  - Total current liabilities: **624,988.48**\n- Total equity:\n  - From balance sheet: **14,903,401.82**\n- Since no non-current liabilities are provided, total liabilities = current liabilities.\n\nCalculation:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Shareholders' Equity}} = \\frac{624,988.48}{14,903,401.82} \\approx 0.042\n\\]\nRounded to two decimals: **0.04**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n- Total revenue: **4,879,769.51**\n- Total assets at end of period: **15,528,390.30**\n\nCalculation:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\nAverage total assets:\n\\[\n\\frac{13,000,000 + 15,528,390.30}{2} = 14,264,195.15\n\\]\n\nAlternatively, since we have only the end period asset figure, we can approximate with end assets:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4,879,769.51}{15,528,390.30} \\approx 0.314\n\\]\n\nLikely the more accurate approach is to use average assets, but given only end figures, we'll proceed with the end period value for simplicity: **0.31**\n\n---\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\n- Quick assets = Cash + Marketable Securities (Bank deposits + Interest receivable + Accounts receivable)\n- From balance sheet:\n  - Cash on Hand: **4,058,544.03**\n  - Bank Deposits: **3,079,000.00**\n  - Interest Receivable: **13,279.60**\n  - Accounts Receivable: **2,984,071.72**\n\nSum:\n\\[\n4,058,544.03 + 3,079,000.00 + 13,279.60 + 2,984,071.72 \\approx 10,134,175.95\n\\]\n\n- Current liabilities: **624,988.48**\n\nQuick Ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{10,134,175.95}{624,988.48} \\approx 16.20\n\\]\n\nNote: Inventory is excluded, as quick assets don't include inventory.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nSame as ratio 1, just confirming:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Net cash from operating activities}}{\\text{Current liabilities}} = -1.38\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n- Net profit: **1,903,401.82**\n- Average equity:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{13,000,000 + 14,903,401.82}{2} = 13,951,700.91\n  \\]\n\nROE:\n\\[\n\\frac{1,903,401.82}{13,951,700.91} \\approx 0.1364 \\text{ or } 13.64\\%\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n- Net Sales (Total Revenue): **4,879,769.51**\n- Accounts Receivable: **2,984,071.72**\n\nCalculation:\n\\[\n\\text{AR Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n\\]\nUsing end accounts receivable:\n\\[\n\\frac{4,879,769.51}{2,984,071.72} \\approx 1.63\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## Final answers:\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.38\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.04\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.31\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"16.20\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.38\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"13.64%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"1.63\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** Ratios are rounded to two decimal places, and percentages are presented clearly.",
