                        "content": "Let's analyze each required ratio step by step:\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how many times a company collects its average accounts receivable per year.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\nAssuming all sales are on credit (since receivables increased), so:\n- Net Sales for the period = Total Revenue from income statement = 4,879,769.51\n- Accounts Receivable at the start = 0 (initial period)\n- Accounts Receivable at the end = 2,984,071.72\n\n**Average Accounts Receivable:**\n\\[ \\frac{0 + 2,984,071.72}{2} = 1,492,035.86 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\frac{4,879,769.51}{1,492,035.86} \\approx 3.27 \\]\n\n**Result:** ~3.27 times\n\n---\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom cash flow:\n- Net cash from operating activities = -862,455.97\n- Current liabilities end = 624,988.48\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\frac{-862,455.97}{624,988.48} \\approx -1.38 \\]\n\n---\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio indicates coverage of current liabilities by operating cash flow:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nSame as ratio 2:\n\\[ \\approx -1.38 \\]\n\n---\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis measures how efficiently the assets generate sales:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\n- Total Revenue = 4,879,769.51\n- Total Assets at start = 15,528,390.30\n- Total Assets at end = 15,528,390.30\n\nSince the total assets are the same at start and end:\n\\[ \\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{15,528,390.30 + 15,528,390.30}{2} = 15,528,390.30 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\frac{4,879,769.51}{15,528,390.30} \\approx 0.31 \\]\n\n---\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities + Total Non-current Liabilities; Since only current liabilities are given (others not specified), assuming total liabilities = 624,988.48\n- Owner's Equity end = 14,903,401.82\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\frac{624,988.48}{14,903,401.82} \\approx 0.042 \\]\n\nRounded to two decimal places, about 0.04.\n\n---\n\n### Final answers:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"3.27\", \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-1.38\", \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.38\", \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.31\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.04\"}}\n```",
