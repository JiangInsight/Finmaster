                        "content": "First, let's understand the components needed to calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio.\n\n**Cash Flow to Debt Ratio** is typically calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Cash Flow from Operating Activities**\n\nFrom the given cash flow statement for the latest period:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = **-862,455.97**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Total Debt**\n\nTotal debt generally includes long-term and short-term obligations. From the balance sheet:\n\n- **Current Liabilities** (short-term debt obligations):  \n  Accounts Payable: 381,000.00  \n  Taxes Payable: 243,988.48  \n  Total Current Liabilities = 624,988.48\n\n- **Long-term liabilities** are not explicitly provided; however, in many cases, total liabilities combine all liabilities. Since the balance sheet provides \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" = 15,528,390.30, and total owner's equity is 14,903,401.82, then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Liabilities} = 15,528,390.30 - 14,903,401.82 = 624,988.48\n\\]\n\nwhich matches the sum of current liabilities.\n\n**Note:** The total debt is often taken as total liabilities for the purpose of this ratio if no specific long-term debt info is given.\n\nSo, **Total Debt** = 624,988.48\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the ratio**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-862,455.97}{624,988.48} \\approx -1.38\n\\]\n\nExpressed as a ratio, itâ€™s approximately **-1.38**.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.38'} }\n```",
