Free Cash Flow (FCF):**  \nFCF = Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures  \nFrom the cash flow statement:  \n- Operating cash flow (Net Cash from Operating Activities): -862,455.97  \n- Capital expenditures (Purchase of Fixed Assets): 0.00  \nThus,  \nFCF = -862,455.97 - 0 = **-862,455.97**\n\n---\n\n**2. Return on Assets (ROA):**  \nROA = (Net Income / Average Total Assets) × 100%  \n\n- Net Income (Net Profit): 1,903,401.82  \n- Assets at end of period: 15,528,390.30  \n- Assets at start of period: 13,000,000.00  \n- Average Total Assets = (13,000,000 + 15,528,390.30) / 2 = 14,264,195.15\n\nROA = (1,903,401.82 / 14,264,195.15) × 100% ≈ 13.33%\n\n---\n\n**3. Return on Equity (ROE):**  \nROE = (Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity) × 100%  \n\n- Shareholders' Equity at end: 14,903,401.82  \n- Shareholders' Equity at start: 13,000,000.00  \n- Average Equity = (13,000,000 + 14,903,401.82) / 2 = 13,951,700.91\n\nROE = (1,903,401.82 / 13,951,700.91) × 100% ≈ 13.63%\n\n---\n\n**4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:**  \n= Operating Cash Flow / Net Profit  \n= -862,455.97 / 1,903,401.82 ≈ -0.45\n\nExpressed as a ratio, approximately 0.45 (positive).  \nBut note that cash flow is negative while profit is positive, so the ratio is negative. To match typical reporting, we can note it as **-0.45**.  \n\nAlternatively, sometimes the absolute value is used, but based on the given data, the ratio is approximately **-0.45**.\n\n---\n\n**5. Net Profit Margin:**  \n= (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%  \n= (1,903,401.82 / 4,879,769.51) × 100% ≈ 38.97%\n\n**6. Gross Profit Margin:**  \n= (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100%  \n= (2,861,769.51 / 4,879,769.51) × 100% ≈ 58.64%\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-862455.97\",\n    \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"13.33%\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"13.63%\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-0.45\",\n    \"Net Profit Margin\": \"38.97%\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"58.64%\"\n  }\n}\n```",
