Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end of period):  \n- **Total Liabilities** = Total Current Liabilities + Total Non-current Liabilities\n\nGiven Data (from balance sheet):  \n- Total Current Liabilities = 624,988.48  \n- Total Non-current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 381,000 + 243,988.48 = 624,988.48\n\n**Note:** The balance sheet provides \"Total Current Liabilities\" but not explicitly non-current liabilities; however, since Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable are typically current liabilities, and no other liabilities are listed, we can assume total liabilities are the sum of these.\n\n- **Total Liabilities** = 624,988.48\n\n- **Total Assets** = 15,528,390.30\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{624,988.48}{15,528,390.30} \\approx 0.0403\n\\]\n\nExpressed as a ratio: approximately **0.04**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}}\n\\]\n\nFrom cash flow statement:  \n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -862,455.97\n\n- Net Profit (Net Income): 1,903,401.82\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{-862,455.97}{1,903,401.82} \\approx -0.4537\n\\]\n\nGiven the negative cash flow from operating activities but positive net income, the ratio is approximately **-0.45**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.04\", \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-0.45\"}}\n```",
