Since the earlier example shows \"4.41\" (likely a decimal ratio), we will present the ratio as approximately **-0.45**.\n\n**Note:** The negative sign indicates that cash flow from operations is negative while net income is positive, which can occur in certain cases.\n\n**Final Step:** Present the result appropriately.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-0.45\"}}\n```",
