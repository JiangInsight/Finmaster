For FCF, we typically start with Operating Cash Flow, then subtract capital expenditures.\n\n3. **Identify Capital Expenditures (CapEx):**\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets = 0.00 (indicates no new investments in fixed assets during the period)\n\n4. **Calculate Free Cash Flow (FCF):**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{FCF} = \\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities} - \\text{Capital Expenditures}\n   \\]\n\n   Since CapEx = 0:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{FCF} = -862,455.97 - 0 = -862,455.97\n   \\]\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-862455.97\"}}\n```",
