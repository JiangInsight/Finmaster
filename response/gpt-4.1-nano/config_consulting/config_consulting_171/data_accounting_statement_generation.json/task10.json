From the data, the initial recognized property, plant, and non-current assets are those recorded on 2023-12-31. The relevant entries are:\n\n- Fixed Assets (initial) = 5,000,000.00  \n- Fixed Assets Purchase (purchase during period) = 20000.00  \n- Fixed Assets Purchase (another during the period) = 1150000.00  \n- Fixed Assets Purchase (another during the period) = 305354.43  \n- Fixed Assets Purchase (another during the period) = 1150000.00  \n- Fixed Assets Purchase (another during the period) = 10000.00  \n- Fixed Assets Purchase (another during the period) = 60000.00  \n- Fixed Assets Purchase (another during the period) = 1300000.00  \n- Fixed Assets Purchase (another during the period) = 2400000.00  \n- Fixed Assets Purchase (another during the period) = 305354.43 (additional purchase)  \n\nAll the above are purchases of fixed assets, and initial fixed assets are 5,000,000.\n\n**Initial total property, plant, and non-current assets** = initial fixed assets as recorded on 2023-12-31:  \n**= 5,000,000.00**\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify final non-current assets**  \nThe latest recorded date in the dataset is 2024-02-05 (or very close). At this date, fixed assets include:\n\n- Fixed Assets (initial) + Purchases - Depreciations (if any).  \nHowever, to simplify, the \"Fixed Assets\" entries should reflect the current asset base, including purchases and deducting depreciation.\n\nFrom the last mentions:\n- Fixed Assets (on 2023-12-31) initial: 5,000,000.00  \n- Purchases after initial: multiple, summarized below:\n  - Several fixed asset purchases during 2024, especially:\n    - 305354.43 (on 2023-12-31, but for end of period, more relevant are Purchases after this date)\n    - 1150000.00 (multiple times)\n    - 60000.00\n    - 10000.00\n    - 2400000.00\n    - 305354.43 (additional)\n    - 305354.43 (latest purchase in 2024)\n    - 45750.41 (depreciation)\n  \nGiven the last fixed asset purchase on 2023-12-31 was recorded at 305,354.43, and additional fixed assets were purchased during 2024, the total assets value would be the sum of the latest non-current assets, including those purchases.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate total assets on the latest date (2024-02-05 or the latest recorded date):**  \nTotal fixed assets (end) is approximately:\n\nStart: 5,000,000  \n+ Total purchases during period (~sum of 2024 fixed assets purchases):  \n  305,354.43 + 1,150,000 + 60,000 + 10,000 + 2,000,000 + 305,354.43 + 45750.41 + 4,000,000 + 305,354.43 + 60000 + 100000 + 45750.41 + 305354.43 + 45750.41 + 305354.43\n  \nCalculations:  \n= 5,000,000 (initial)  \n+ 305,354.43  \n+ 1,150,000.00  \n+ 60,000.00  \n+ 10,000.00  \n+ 2,000,000.00  \n+ 305,354.43  \n+ 45,750.41  \n+ 4,000,000.00  \n+ 305,354.43  \n+ 60,000.00  \n+ 100,000.00  \n+ 45,750.41  \n+ 305,354.43  \n+ 45,750.41  \n+ 305,354.43  \n\nSum these:  \n= 5,000,000 + 305,354.43 + 1,150,000 + 60,000 + 10,000 + 2,000,000 + 305,354.43 + 45,750.41 + 4,000,000 + 305,354.43 + 60,000 + 100,000 + 45,750.41 + 305,354.43 + 45,750.41 + 305,354.43\n\nTotal sum:  \n= 5,000,000  \n+ 305,354.43 (initial fixed assets)  \n+ 1,150,000 (purchase)  \n+ 60,000 (purchase)  \n+ 10,000 (purchase)  \n+ 2,000,000 (purchase)  \n+ 305,354.43 (purchase)  \n+ 45,750.41 (Depreciation)  \n+ 4,000,000 (purchase)  \n+ 305,354.43 (purchase)  \n+ 60,000 (purchase)  \n+ 100,000 (purchase)  \n+ 45,750.41 (Depreciation)  \n+ 305,354.43 (purchase)  \n+ 45,750.41 (Depreciation)  \n+ 305,354.43 (purchase)  \n\nAdding:  \n= 5,000,000 + 305,354.43 + 1,150,000 + 60,000 + 10,000 + 2,000,000 + 305,354.43 + 45,750.41 + 4,000,000 + 305,354.43 + 60,000 + 100,000 + 45,750.41 + 305,354.43 + 45,750.41 + 305,354.43\n\nTotal:  \n= 5,000,000 + 305,354.43 + 1,150,000 + 60,000 + 10,000 + 2,000,000 + 305,354.43 + 45,750.41 + 4,000,000 + 305,354.43 + 60,000 + 100,000 + 45,750.41 + 305,354.43 + 45,750.41 + 305,354.43\n\nSum step-by-step:  \n5,000,000  \n+ 305,354.43 = 5,305,354.43  \n+ 1,150,000 = 6,455,354.43  \n+ 60,000 = 6,515,354.43  \n+ 10,000 = 6,525,354.43  \n+ 2,000,000 = 8,525,354.43  \n+ 305,354.43 = 8,830,708.86  \n+ 45,750.41 = 8,876,459.27  \n+ 4,000,000 = 12,876,459.27  \n+ 305,354.43 = 13,181,813.7  \n+ 60,000 = 13,241,813.7  \n+ 100,000 = 13,341,813.7  \n+ 45,750.41 = 13,387,564.11  \n+ 305,354.43 = 13,692,918.54  \n+ 45,750.41 = 13,738,668.95  \n+ 305,354.43 = 14,044,023.38\n\nNote: the depreciation entries are deducted from the total fixed assets, but unless explicitly given as cumulative depreciation, we assume they are reductions. However, the dataset assigns \"Depreciation\" as negative, but for simplicity, and given the question, the total fixed assets in the last data point is approximately **around 5,000,000 + sum of purchases**.\n\nAlternatively, since the depreciation is shown as an expense, it effectively reduces value; for simplicity here, focusing on the cumulative property, plant, and equipment, the latest recorded value in the data is:\n\n- On 2024-02-05: **about 5,000,000 + all subsequent asset investments** minus depreciation.\n\nFrom the explicit fixed asset value entry at the latest date, we see:\n\n- Fixed Assets (latest) as recorded on 2024-02-05:  \n  **Approximately 5,000,000 (initial) + relevant purchases âˆ’ depreciation**\n\nThe most accurate approach is to consider the \"Fixed Assets\" record at the last date, which is:\n\n- 305,354.43 (latest purchase)  \n- Accounts for the accumulated reporting in the dataset.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n- Initial total property, plant, and non-current assets: **5,000,000.00**  \n- Ending total property, plant, and non-current assets: **approximately 5,259,603.02** (from last recorded fixed asset value explicitly shown)\n\n---\n\n### **Final output:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '5259603.02'}}\n```",
