There's no sale of assets listed in the data provided.\n\n### Final calculation:\n\n- **Net cash flows from investing activities = Cash inflows from asset sales - Cash outflows from asset purchase**\n\n- Since no asset sales are listed, the inflow is **0**\n\n- Outflow: **-305,354.43** (cash spent on fixed asset purchase)\n\n**Result:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-305354.43'} }\n```",
