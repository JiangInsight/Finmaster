Typically, this would be represented as \"Taxes Payable\" in the balance sheet. \n\n1. The relevant line item is \"Taxes Payable\".\n2. Initial amount (initial value): 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n3. Final amount (end value): 243988.48 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\nThus, the initial accrued taxes not yet paid was zero, and by the end date, it increased to 243,988.48.\n\nAnswer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '243988.48'}}\n```",
