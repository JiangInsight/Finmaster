The focus is on the line item that represents interest accrued but not yet received, which typically appears as an asset called \"Interest Receivable.\" \n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Look for the line item named \"Interest Receivable\" in the provided data.\n2. Note the initial amount at the start date.\n3. Note the final amount at the end date.\n4. These values represent the interest accrued but not yet received, with initial and final values.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Initial value for Interest Receivable at 2023-12-31: 0.00\n- End value for Interest Receivable at 2024-02-05: 13279.60\n\nTherefore, the specific line items and amounts of interest accrued but not yet received are identified with:\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- Final value: 13279.60\n\nNow, present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '13279.60'} }\n```",
