Review the accounts listed in the data.\n2. Focus on accounts representing amounts owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit.\n3. These typically include \"Accounts Payable.\"\n4. Check the initial and end values of \"Accounts Payable\" for the given period.\n\nFrom the provided table:\n- Accounts Payable initial value: 0.00\n- Accounts Payable end value: 381,000.00\n\nThis indicates that the account started with no amount owed and at the end of the period, the amount owed for goods or services purchased on credit is 381,000.00.\n\nSolution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"381000.00\"}}\n```",
