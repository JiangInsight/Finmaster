Typically, such amounts are reflected under \"Accounts Receivable\" in a balance sheet, which indicates credit sales receivables owed to the company.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Initial \"Accounts Receivable\" value: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- End \"Accounts Receivable\" value: 2,984,071.72 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\nSince the initial value was zero and increased to approximately 2.98 million, this indicates new credit sales made during the period are now owed to the entity.\n\nAll other accounts listed like \"Cash on Hand,\" \"Bank Deposits,\" \"Interest Receivable,\" and \"Inventory\" refer to different types of assets but not specifically amounts owed for goods or services sold on credit.\n\nTherefore:\n\n**Line item:** Accounts Receivable  \n**Initial amount:** 0.00  \n**Final amount:** 2,984,071.72\n\n__Final answer in the required JSON format:__\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"2984071.72\"}}\n```",
