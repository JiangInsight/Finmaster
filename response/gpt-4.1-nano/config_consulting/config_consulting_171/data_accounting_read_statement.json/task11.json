In the given data, the relevant account is \"Retained Earnings.\"\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Initial value of \"Retained Earnings\": 0.00 (on 2023-12-31)\n- End value of \"Retained Earnings\": 1903401.82 (on 2024-02-05)\n\nSince the initial value of retained earnings was zero and the ending value is positive, the change represents the profit retained in the entity over this period.\n\nTherefore, the profit retained (and not distributed) in the entity is 1,903,401.82.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"1903401.82\"}}\n```",
