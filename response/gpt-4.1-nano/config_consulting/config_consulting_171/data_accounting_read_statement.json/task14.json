These typically include current liabilities such as accounts payable and taxes payable.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n\n- Accounts Payable (initial: 0.00, end: 381,000.00)\n- Taxes Payable (initial: 0.00, end: 243,988.48)\n\nBoth are current liabilities likely to be settled within the operating cycle.\n\nNext, sum their end values to get the total liabilities expected to be settled in the normal course.\n\nCalculation:\n- End value of Accounts Payable: 381,000.00\n- End value of Taxes Payable: 243,988.48\n\nTotal liabilities expected to be settled:\n381,000.00 + 243,988.48 = 624,988.48\n\nInitial total for these liabilities was zero, and the final corresponds to the sum above.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '624988.48'} }\n```",
