Initial \"Accounts Payable\" (2023-12-31): 0.00\n2. End \"Accounts Payable\" (2024-02-05): 381,000.00\n3. Since the initial amount was zero and increased to 381,000.00, the addition during this period is 381,000.00.\n\nThis represents the new liabilities incurred for goods or services received on credit.\n\nAnswer:\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"381000.00\"}}",
