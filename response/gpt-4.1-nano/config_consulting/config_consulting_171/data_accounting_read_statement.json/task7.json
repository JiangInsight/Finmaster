From the data, the only line item related directly to expenses is \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" which reflects accumulated depreciation expense over time.\n\n- Initial value for \"Accumulated Depreciation\": 0.00\n- End value for \"Accumulated Depreciation\": 91505.05\n\nSince depreciation accumulated over the period represents an expense during this time frame, the change (increase) in accumulated depreciation is recognized as depreciation expense for the period.\n\nTherefore, the expense value is the increase in accumulated depreciation:\n\n**Expense (Depreciation) = End value - Initial value = 91505.05 - 0.00 = 91505.05**\n\n**Note:** The other line items such as interest receivable and accounts receivable are assets, not expenses. Accounts payable and taxes payable are liabilities, and no explicit expense items like interest expense are listed separately. Given the data, the only accounting expense available is depreciation.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"91505.05\"}}\n```",
