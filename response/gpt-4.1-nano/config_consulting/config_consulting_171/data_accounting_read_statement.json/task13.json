Typically, these are non-current assets, such as property, plant, equipment, intangible assets, and other long-term investments.\n\nFrom the given data, the relevant line item is:\n- Fixed Assets (including accumulated depreciation, which is a contra-asset and not a separate asset itself)\n\nThe \"Fixed Assets\" line in the data shows:\n- Initial value: 5000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- End value: 5000000.00 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\nSince these are not expected to be realized or sold in the normal operating cycle, they should be included.\n\nTherefore, the output is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5000000.00'} }\n```",
