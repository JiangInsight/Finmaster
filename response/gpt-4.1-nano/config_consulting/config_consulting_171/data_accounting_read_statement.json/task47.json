Look for the line item \"Net Increase\" which represents the net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n2. The value of \"Net Increase\" in the data is -862455.97.\n3. The starting balance (\"Beginning Balance\") of cash and cash equivalents is 8,000,000.00.\n4. The ending balance (\"Ending Balance\") is 7,137,544.03.\n5. The net addition (or net increase) in cash during the period is confirmed as -862,455.97, which is consistent with the change from beginning to ending balances:\n   \n   8,000,000.00 + (-862,455.97) = 7,137,544.03 (which matches the ending balance).\n\n6. To decompose this net addition into two components, we can consider the main sources affecting cash:\n   - \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" \n   - \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\"\n\n7. From the data:\n   - \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" = -862,455.97\n   - \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" = -0.00\n\n8. Since the total \"Net Increase\" equals the sum of these, the components are:\n   \n   sub_item 1: Cash flow from operating activities = -862,455.97\n\n   sub_item 2: Cash flow from investing activities = -0.00\n\nTherefore, the decomposition of net addition (-862,455.97) is into:\n- Operating activities component: -862,455.97\n- Investing activities component: -0.00\n\n**Final Answer in required JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-862455.97\", \"sub_items_sub_item value1\": \"-862455.97\", \"sub_items_sub_item value2\": \"-0.00\"}}\n```",
