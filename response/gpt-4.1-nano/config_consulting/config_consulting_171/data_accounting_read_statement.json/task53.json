The key is to understand that the COGS represents the value of inventory sold during the period.\n\nStep 4: Interpretation:\n- The 'carrying amount of inventories sold' during the period is represented by the COGS value, which reflects the book value of inventories sold.\n\nTherefore, the value of inventories sold is 2,018,000.00.\n\nFinal step: Present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"2018000.00\"}}\n```",
