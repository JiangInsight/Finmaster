This item represents the capital contributed by shareholders when the shares were issued and any changes over the period.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n- Initial Paid-in Capital (2023-12-31): 13,000,000.00\n- End Paid-in Capital (2024-02-05): 13,000,000.00\n\nThe amount remains the same, indicating no additional capital was contributed during this period.\n\nTherefore, the initial and final values of shareholder contributions are both 13,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"13000000.00\", \"end value\": \"13000000.00\"}}\n```",
