                        "content": "To identify the tangible items held for use in production, supply of goods/services, rental, or administrative purposes, we need to look for fixed assets or similar line items. These are typically categorized under \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Total Non-current Assets.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. **Fixed Assets**: This line item explicitly refers to tangible items used in business operations. Initial value: 5,000,000.00; End value: 5,000,000.00.\n2. **Total Non-current Assets**: Also includes fixed assets along with other non-current assets, but since we are asked for specific tangible items used in operations (fixed assets), the \"Fixed Assets\" line is most precise.\n3. Although \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is related to fixed assets, it represents depreciation deducted from the initial value, so the initial and end values are not both tangible asset valuesâ€”they describe associated depreciation.\n4. The \"Inventory\" item, while tangible, is typically held for sale, not for use in production or administrative purposes, based on general accounting classifications.\n\nTherefore, the relevant line item is \"Fixed Assets\" with initial and end values.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5000000.00'}}\n```",
