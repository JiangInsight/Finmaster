The relevant line items for taxes in cash flow statements are typically \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" or \"Tax Expense\" adjustments.\n2. From the provided data, the line \"(Increase) Decrease in Tax Payable\" appears, which indicates the change in tax accrued that has not yet been paid.\n3. For the date 2024-02-05, this line shows an amount of 243988.48.\n4. The positive value suggests an increase in tax payable (tax accrued but not yet paid).\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and its value related to the increase in tax accrued but not yet paid is \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with the amount 243988.48.\n\nSolution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '243988.48'}}\n```",
