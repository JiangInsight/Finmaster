                        "content": "Let's analyze the cash flow statement step by step to identify the line item that indicates a decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit during the period.\n\n1. Look for line items that relate to liabilities owed by the company, such as \"Accounts Payable\" or similar.\n\n2. The change in \"Accounts Payable\" reflects how much the company either increased or decreased its amounts owed to suppliers or creditors.\n\n3. The line \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Payable\" shows the net change in this liability.\n\n4. Since the problem asks for the specific line item and value of decrease in amounts owed (liabilities owed to the entity), we are particularly interested in decreases. A decrease in accounts payable indicates that the company paid off some of its liabilities, thus reducing what it owes.\n\n5. The value provided for \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Payable\" on the given date is **381,000.00**. Because it is labeled as \"Increase (Decrease),\" a positive value here indicates an increase; a negative value indicates a decrease.\n\n6. In the provided statement, the value for \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Payable\" is **381,000.00** (positive), which suggests an increase in accounts payable. To find a decrease, we look for a negative value.\n\n7. Since the value is positive, the decrease in amounts owed to the entity (accounts payable reduction) would be the opposite sign, i.e., **-381,000.00**.\n\n8. Thus, the line item and value representing the decrease in amounts owed to the entity on this date is:\n   - Line item: \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Payable\"\n   - Amount: **-381,000.00**\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-381000.00'} }\n```",
