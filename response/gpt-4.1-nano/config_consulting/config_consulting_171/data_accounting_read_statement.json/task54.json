The relevant expenses are typically classified under **Selling Expenses** because they are associated with securing customer orders and delivering products/services.\n2. From the income statement, the \"Selling Expenses\" line item reflects costs directly related to sales efforts, order fulfillment, and delivery mechanisms.\n\nIn the provided data:\n- For the first problem set, Selling Expenses = 493,854.67\n- For the second problem set, Selling Expenses = 274,260.07\n\nSince the task asks for the specific line item and value for costs to secure customer orders and to deliver goods/services, and considering typical accounting practices, **\"Selling Expenses\"** is the appropriate line item.\n\nGiven the example, the answer should be the value from the \"Selling Expenses\" line.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '493854.67'} }\n```",
