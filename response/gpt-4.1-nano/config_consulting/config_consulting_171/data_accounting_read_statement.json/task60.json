Funds deposit into a bank: The \"Bank Deposits\" end amount: **3,079,000.00**\n2. Income from financial assets: \"Interest Income\": **13,279.60**\n\nFinal step: Present the values in JSON as required.\n\nAnswer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"3079000.00\", \"value2\": \"13279.60\" }}\n```\n\nThis matches the data examined and the typical interpretation of these line items.",
