The first line item of interest is the income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities. Based on standard income statement structure, this is typically termed as \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Revenue from core operations.\"\n\n2. From the provided data, the \"Main Business Revenue\" is listed as 4,879,769.51 on 2024-02-05.\n\n3. The second line item relates to the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, which is typically recorded as \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\n4. In the given data, \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is 2,018,000.00.\n\n**Therefore, the extracted values are:**\n\n- Income from core operating activities: 4,879,769.51\n- Inventories sold during the period: 2,018,000.00\n\nThe order of output should match the original sequence: first the income arising from core operations, then the inventory cost.\n\n**Final answer in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '4879769.51', 'value2': '2018000.00'}}\n```",
