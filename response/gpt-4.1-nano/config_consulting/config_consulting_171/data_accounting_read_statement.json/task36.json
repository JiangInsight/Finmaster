Since the question asks for the amount of profit retained after everything, and \"Net Profit\" represents that figure, no further calculation is needed.\n\n**Final answer:** The specific line item is \"Net Profit,\" and its value is 1903401.82.\n\n---\n\n**Answer in the required format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1903401.82'} }\n```",
