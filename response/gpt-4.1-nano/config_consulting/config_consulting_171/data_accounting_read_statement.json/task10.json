The initial amount (at the start date) and final amount (at the end date) reflect the capital contributed by shareholders.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Initial value of Paid-in Capital: 13,000,000.00\n- End value of Paid-in Capital: 13,000,000.00\n\nSince there is no change in this account over the period, it indicates the initial capital contributed by shareholders and the remaining value as of the end date.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n1. Identify \"Paid-in Capital\" account.\n2. Extract initial and final amounts.\n3. Confirm these amounts represent the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"13000000.00\", \"end value\": \"13000000.00\"}}\n```",
