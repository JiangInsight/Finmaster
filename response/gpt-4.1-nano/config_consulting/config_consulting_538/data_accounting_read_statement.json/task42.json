Look at the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section.\n2. Find the line item that indicates the purchase of fixed assets.\n3. The amount associated with \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is the cash payment related to acquiring property, plant, and equipment.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is listed with an amount of 0.00.\n- The net cash flow from investing activities is also -0.00, which confirms no cash was paid for these purposes during this period.\n\nThus, the specific line item and value of cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment is 0.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
