This is typically referred to as \"Depreciation expense\" and is usually found in the financial statements, especially in the income statement or cash flow statement.\n\nStep 1: Look for depreciation-related line items in the income statement and cash flow statement.  \n- In the latest income statements provided, the depreciation line appears explicitly as \"Depreciation\" with consistent amounts.  \n- In the cash flow statements, \"Depreciation\" also appears as an adjustment, reflecting its role in non-cash expense allocation.\n\nStep 2: Review the values.  \n- In the first dataset: Depreciation is 45,751.41  \n- In the second dataset: Depreciation is 91,503.06\n\nStep 3: Confirm the correct line item and value.  \nSince the question asks for the \"systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life,\" the relevant line item is \"Depreciation.\"  \n\nThe value to extract is the depreciation expense recognized during the period, which is explicitly mentioned.\n\nFor the first provided dataset, the depreciation expense is 45,751.41.  \nFor the second dataset, it's 91,503.06.\n\nGiven the structure of the task and the example, I will extract the depreciation value from the dataset in question.\n\n**Final answer:**  \nThe second dataset shows a depreciation value of **91,503.06**.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"91503.06\"}}\n```",
