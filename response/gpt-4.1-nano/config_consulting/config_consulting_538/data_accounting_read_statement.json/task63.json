End value of net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the principal revenue-producing activities (Net cash flow from operating activities).\n2. The amounts of taxes accrued but not yet paid (Tax Payable).\n3. Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities (Net Profit).\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Find each value in the financial statements**\n\n- **Cash and Cash Equivalents Generated from Principal Revenue-Producing Activities:**\n  From the Cash Flow Statement, the line \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" shows the cash generated from core operational activities.\n  \n  **Value:** 116,257.19\n\n- **Taxes accrued but not yet paid:**\n  From the Balance Sheet (Liabilities section), \"Taxes Payable\" shows taxes that are accrued but not yet paid.\n  \n  **Values in both data sets:** \n    - First problem: 151,271.87\n    - Second problem: 151,271.87\n  \n  Use this value.\n\n- **Total income arising in the course of ordinary activities:**\n  This is represented by \"Net Profit\" (or net income).\n  \n  **Values in both sets:** \n    - First problem: -1,645,141.43\n    - Second problem: 963,263.19\n  \n  The net income for the period in the second problem is positive and indicates income from regular operations.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Format the answer as per instructions**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '116257.19', 'value2': '151271.87', 'value3': '963263.19'}}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"116257.19\", \"value2\": \"151271.87\", \"value3\": \"963263.19\"}}\n```",
