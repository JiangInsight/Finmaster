                        "content": "To identify the reduction in the amount of assets held for sale during the period, we need to look for line items that typically represent reductions in assets classified as held for sale, especially those related to assets in the process of being manufactured, in production, or for sale.\n\nIn the cash flow statement, reductions in such assets are often reflected as decreases or disinvestments associated with \"Assets held for sale\" or similar line items. Usually, the line item is explicitly called out as \"Assets held for sale,\" \"Proceeds from assets held for sale,\" or \"Reduction in assets held for sale.\"\n\nIn the provided cash flow statement, the only line item that closely matches this description is the \"Decrease in Inventory\", because inventory that is in the normal course of business or in process of being manufactured could be classified under assets held for sale or in inventory, which is part of assets being prepared or ready for sale.\n\nThe \"Decrease in Inventory\" amount is -174,000.00, indicating a reduction in inventory assets, which include assets held for sale in process or ready for sale.\n\nHence, the specific line item and value of reduction during the period is:\n- Line item: \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\"\n- Value: -174000.00\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-174000.00\"}}\n```",
