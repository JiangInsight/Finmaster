Look for the line item that directly mentions tax payable or taxes accrued but not paid.\n2. In this case, the line \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" matches this description.\n3. The value given for \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" on the date 2024-02-05 is 151271.87.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and value of increase in the amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid is 151271.87.\n\nNow, I will format the answer in the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"151271.87\"}}\n```",
