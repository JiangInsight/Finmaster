                        "content": "To identify the costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services, we need to look at relevant expenses in the income statement related to sales, order processing, and delivery.\n\nStep 1: Review the expenses in the income statement:\n- Administrative Expenses: These often include costs related to securing customer orders, such as sales and marketing, as well as other administrative costs.\n- Selling Expenses: These typically include costs directly related to selling products and services, such as advertising, sales commissions, delivery, and freight.\n- Distribution and delivery costs are commonly categorized under Selling Expenses.\n\nStep 2: Focus on the 'Selling Expenses' and 'Administrative Expenses':\n- In the first example, the 'Selling Expenses' are $493,854.67, covering costs associated with marketing, sales commissions, transportation, and delivery.\n- In the second example, 'Selling Expenses' are $345,311.74, which also include similar costs.\n\nStep 3: Determine the specific line item:  \nThe task asks for the costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services. Those are generally captured within:\n- \"Selling Expenses\" for delivery costs.\n- \"Administrative Expenses\" may include costs for securing orders and customer relationship management.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion:\nGiven the typical categorization, the primary line item that directly relates to the costs for delivering goods and services, and often those associated with securing orders, is \"Selling Expenses.\"\n\nTherefore, in both cases, the specific line item and value for costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods/services are best represented by \"Selling Expenses.\"\n\nStep 5: Select the value:\n- First example: $493,854.67\n- Second example: $345,311.74\n\nThe question is posed generally and only one answer is requested. Since the second problem is the more recent accounting period, and the task does not specify which example to reference, the most consistent approach is to provide the variable for the second problem.\n\nAnswer:\n{\"solution\": {'value': '345311.74'}}\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"345311.74\"}}\n```",
