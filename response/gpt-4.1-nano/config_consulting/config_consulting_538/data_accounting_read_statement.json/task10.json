The initial value of \"Paid-in Capital\" is 13,000,000.00.\n2. The end value of \"Paid-in Capital\" remains the same at 13,000,000.00.\n3. Since the \"Paid-in Capital\" accounts for contributed capital, these figures reflect the initial and final capital contributed by shareholders.\n\nAnswer in the required format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
