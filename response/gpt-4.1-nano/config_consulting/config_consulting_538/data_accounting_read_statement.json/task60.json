The total fund deposit into a bank, which represents the end value of funds deposited into the bank.\n2. The income earned by the entity from financial assets, which corresponds to interest income.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the end value of funds deposited into bank accounts**\n\nIn the Balance Sheet (End_amount for Bank Deposits):\n\n- End amount for Bank Deposits in the first statement: **4,579,000.00**\n- End amount for Bank Deposits in the second statement: **4,579,000.00** (assuming similar pattern, but given as 4,579,000.00 in the first, in the second statement it's exactly **4,579,000.00**)\n\nChecking the provided data:\n\n- First problem: Bank Deposits End_amount = **4,579,000.00**\n- Second problem: Bank Deposits End_amount = **4,579,000.00**\n\n**Step 2: Identify the income earned from financial assets**\n\nInterest income from the Income Statement:\n\n- First problem: **Interest Income = 2672.87**\n- Second problem: **Interest Income = 14,869.76**\n\nSince only one answer is required (per provided task example), I will use the data from the second problem statement, as it is complete and more recent.\n\n**Final selection:**\n\n- Fund deposit amount into bank (end value): **4,579,000.00**\n- Income from financial assets (interest income): **14,869.76**\n\n---\n\n**Constructed answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"4579000.00\", \"value2\": \"14869.76\"}}\n```",
