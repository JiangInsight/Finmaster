Depreciation | 91,503.06 |\n| 2. Reduction in assets held for sale/in production | -174,000.00 |\n| 3. Cash flows from acquisition/disposal of long-term assets and investments | -0.00 |\n| 4. Net increase in cash and cash equivalents | 116,257.19 |\n\n---\n\n### Final answer in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91503.06', 'value2': '-174000.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '116257.19'}}\n```",
