Common line items that represent costs of securing and delivering customer orders include \"Selling Expenses,\" \"Distribution Expenses,\" or similar items.\n\nIn the provided income statement, the relevant line item is \"Selling Expenses,\" which generally encompasses costs related to securing customer orders and distributing goods and services.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Review all line items for labels associated with sales, marketing, distribution, or related activities.\n2. \"Selling Expenses\" are explicitly related to the sales process, including costs to secure orders.\n3. The value of \"Selling Expenses\" is 345311.74.\n\nTherefore, the specific cost to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services is 345,311.74.\n\nFinal answer in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '345311.74'}}\n```",
