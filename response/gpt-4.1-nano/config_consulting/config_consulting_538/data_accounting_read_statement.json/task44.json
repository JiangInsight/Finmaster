In the provided table, the relevant line is labeled as \"Cash and Cash Equivalents.\"\n\nStep 2: Look at the value next to \"Ending Balance\" on the date 2024-02-05. The value listed is 8,116,257.19.\n\nStep 3: Confirm that this is the final cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the period because \"Ending Balance\" on that date is the standard line item representing the cash and cash equivalents at the period's close.\n\nTherefore, the cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period are 8,116,257.19.\n\nAnswer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"8116257.19\"}}\n```",
