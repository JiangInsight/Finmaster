In both balance sheets, there is a line \"Taxes Payable\":\n   - First balance sheet: Initial amount = 0.00, End amount = 271550.92\n   - Second balance sheet: Initial amount = 0.00, End amount = 151271.87\n\n3. Since these are \"taxes payable,\" they represent taxes that are accrued but not yet paid as of the respective dates.\n\n4. The question asks for the initial and final values for \"tax accrued but not yet paid.\" Therefore, for both balance sheets, the initial value is 0.00, and the final value is the respective \"Taxes Payable\" amount.\n\nIn this case, since the problem is mainly about the concept of accrued but unpaid taxes, the relevant line item and its values are:\n\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- Final value: 271550.92 (from the first balance sheet) or 151271.87 (from the second balance sheet)\n\nTo match the format requested, I will provide the answer based on the latest (final) balance sheet data, i.e., the second one.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"151271.87\"}}\n```",
