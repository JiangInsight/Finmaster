                        "content": "Let's analyze the data step-by-step:\n\n1. The total amount of liabilities and equity at initial and final points:\n\n- Initial: 13,000,000.00\n- Final: 14,930,535.06\n\n2. These are composed of two main components:\n- Total Liabilities (sum of Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable + Total Current Liabilities, or directly from \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" minus Owner's Equity)\n- Total Owner's Equity\n\n3. From the data:\n- At initial:\n  - Total Owner's Equity = 13,000,000.00\n  - Total Liabilities = 0.00 (from \"Total Current Liabilities\" = 0.00, \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" = 13,000,000.00, so liabilities = total - equity)\n    - Liabilities = 13,000,000.00 - 13,000,000.00 = 0.00\n- At final:\n  - Total Owner's Equity = 13,963,263.19\n  - Total Liabilities = 14,930,535.06 - 13,963,263.19 = 967,271.87\n\n4. Sub-items for liabilities:\n- Initial liabilities components:\n  - Accounts Payable = 0.00\n  - Taxes Payable = 0.00\n  - Total Current Liabilities = 0.00\n  - So, initial liabilities = 0.00\n\n- Final liabilities components:\n  - Accounts Payable = 816,000.00\n  - Taxes Payable = 151,271.87\n  - Total Current Liabilities = 967,271.87\n\n5. For Equity:\n- Initial Equity = 13,000,000.00\n- Final Equity = 13,963,263.19\n\nNow, summary:\n\n- Total liabilities and equity initial and final: 13,000,000.00 and 14,930,535.06\n- Sub-items:\n  - Liabilities initial: 0.00\n  - Liabilities final: 967,271.87\n  - Owner's Equity initial: 13,000,000.00\n  - Owner's Equity final: 13,963,263.19\n\nFinally, formatting the answer as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '14930535.06', 'sub_items_initial sub_item value1': '0.00', 'sub_items_end sub_item value1': '967271.87', 'sub_items_initial sub_item value2': '13000000.00', 'sub_items_end sub_item value2': '13963263.19'}}\n```",
