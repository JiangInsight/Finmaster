Gross Profit (from sales less COGS)\n2. Administrative Expenses (expenses reducing profit)\n3. Selling Expenses (expenses reducing profit)\n4. Financial Expenses and Income (interest income and expenses net effect)\n\nThus, I will choose these four sub-items involved in the calculation:\n\n- Gross Profit\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Selling Expenses\n- Financial Expenses (net of interest income)\n\nNow, find the initial and final values of these sub-items:\n\n- Gross Profit: 1713437.82\n- Administrative Expenses: 126790.73\n- Selling Expenses: 345311.74\n- Financial Expenses: 50166.99\n- Interest Income: 14869.76 (not a direct expense, but impacts net financial expenses)\n\nThe \"final\" value in the context of why I've chosen these four components corresponds to these same line items as they appear in the input, representing their contribution to determining the profit before tax.\n\nPutting it all together in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"1114535.06\", \"sub_items_sub_item_value1\": \"1713437.82\", \"sub_items_sub_item_value2\": \"126790.73\", \"sub_items_sub_item_value3\": \"345311.74\", \"sub_items_sub_item_value4\": \"50166.99\"}}\n```",
