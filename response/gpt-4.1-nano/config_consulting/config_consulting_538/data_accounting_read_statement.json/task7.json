Since we are comparing initial and end values, the difference represents the change over the period, which may correspond to expenses incurred.\n\nStep 2: Look at the relevant accounts, especially those that might reflect expenses, such as \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" \"Interest Receivable,\" or others. In this case, \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is a contra-asset account, which typically increases with depreciation expense.\n\nStep 3: Find the initial and final values for \"Accumulated Depreciation\":\n\n- Initial value: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- End value: 91503.06 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\nStep 4: The change in \"Accumulated Depreciation\" = Final - Initial = 91503.06 - 0.00 = 91503.06. Since accumulated depreciation increases over time due to depreciation expense, this figure represents the depreciation expense for the period.\n\nStep 5: Confirm no other account shows a similar relevant change that would indicate an expense. \"Interest Receivable\" increased (from 0.00 to 14869.76), but that is an asset, not an expense. Assets rising are not expenses; expenses decrease assets or net income.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the depreciation expense over this period is 91503.06.\n\nSolution formulation:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '91503.06'}}\n```",
