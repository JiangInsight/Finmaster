The goal is to find the **net profit after all expenses** and the **cash payments for property, plant, and equipment (PPE) and other long-term assets**, which corresponds to the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" line.\n\n2. In the statement:\n   - \"Net Profit\" represents the profit after all expenses.\n   - \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" indicates cash payments for long-term assets.\n\n3. The problem asks for:\n   - The amount of profit retained after deductions (which is \"Net Profit\").\n   - The cash payments for property, plant, and equipment (which is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\").\n\n4. Extract the relevant values:\n   - Net Profit: 963263.19\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 0.00\n\nNow, forming the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '963263.19', 'value2': '0.00'} }\n```",
