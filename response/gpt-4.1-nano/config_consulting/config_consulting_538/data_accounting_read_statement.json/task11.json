The key account to look for is \"Retained Earnings,\" which typically reflects the accumulated profit or loss retained in the entity, not distributed to shareholders.\n2. At the initial date (2023-12-31), Retained Earnings was 0.00.\n3. At the end date (2024-02-05), Retained Earnings is 963,263.19.\n4. The change in Retained Earnings from initial to end date indicates the amount of profit retained over the period (assuming no dividends distributed).\n\nTherefore, the initial value of retained earnings was 0.00, and the final value is 963,263.19.\n\nNow, presenting the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '963263.19'}}\n```",
