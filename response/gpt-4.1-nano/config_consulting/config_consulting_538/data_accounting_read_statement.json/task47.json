This is labeled as \"Net Increase\" in the statement.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Net Increase / Decrease in Cash and Cash Equivalents: 116,257.19\n\nNext, decompose this net addition into two components: beginning balance and ending balance of cash and cash equivalents, which are provided:\n\n- Beginning Balance: 8,000,000.00\n- Ending Balance: 8,116,257.19\n\nThe net increase is actually the difference between ending and beginning balances:\n- 8,116,257.19 - 8,000,000.00 = 116,257.19\n\nThus, the net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period is 116,257.19, decomposed into:\n- Beginning Balance: 8,000,000.00\n- Ending Balance: 8,116,257.19\n\nNow, format the answer according to the required structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value\": \"116257.19\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value1\": \"8000000.00\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value2\": \"8116257.19\"\n  }\n}\n```",
