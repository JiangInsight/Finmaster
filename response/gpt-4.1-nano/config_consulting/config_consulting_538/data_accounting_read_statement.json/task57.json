The task is to find the specific line item and its value related to the increase in liabilities for credit purchases, typically found in the Accounts Payable account on the balance sheet.\n\n2. In the first data set (balance sheet), the relevant account is \"Accounts Payable,\" which shows the opening and closing balances.\n\n3. Looking at the change in \"Accounts Payable\" from initial to end balance:\n\n   - Initial Balance (2023-12-31): 0.00\n   - End Balance (2024-02-05): 816,000.00\n\n4. The increase (or addition) in Accounts Payable is calculated as:\n\n   \\( \\text{Increase in Accounts Payable} = \\text{End Balance} - \\text{Initial Balance} = 816,000.00 - 0.00 = 816,000.00 \\)\n\n5. Since the initial balance was zero, the entire ending balance indicates the new amount owed due to credit purchases during the period.\n\n6. This amount of 816,000.00 represents the additional liabilities for goods or services received on credit.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item is \"Accounts Payable,\" and the value of its increase during the period is 816,000.00.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"816000.00\"}}\n```",
