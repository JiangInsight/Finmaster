This account represents interest income that has been earned but not yet received in cash.\n\nStep 1: Find the initial and final amounts of interest receivable.\n- Initial amount (as of 2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End amount (as of 2024-02-05): 14869.76\n\nStep 2: Since the \"interest receivable\" increased from 0.00 to 14869.76, this indicates the accrued interest not yet received during this period.\n\nStep 3: The problem asks for the specific line item and its initial and final values, both of which are known.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n- initial value: 0.00\n- end value: 14869.76\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"14869.76\"}}\n```",
