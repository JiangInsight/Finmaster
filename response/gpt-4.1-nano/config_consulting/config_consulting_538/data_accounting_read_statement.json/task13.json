                        "content": "To identify the line items of total assets that are not expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle, we need to consider non-current assets, specifically fixed assets and accumulated depreciation, as these are long-term assets typically not intended for sale within the normal operating cycle.\n\n1. The initial value of Fixed Assets is 5,000,000.00, and the end value is 5,000,000.00. Since this asset is a long-term asset and not intended for sale, it qualifies.\n\n2. Accumulated Depreciation is a contra-asset account linked to fixed assets, with initial value 0.00 and final value 91,503.06. Although it's a liability offset, it is associated with fixed assets, which are not intended for sale.\n\n3. Total Non-current Assets initially is 5,000,000.00, ending at 4,908,496.94, representing the net book value of fixed assets after depreciation.\n\nTherefore, the specific line items and values of total assets that are not expected to be realized or intended for sale in the normal cycle are the fixed assets and accumulated depreciation.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '4908496.94'}}\n```",
