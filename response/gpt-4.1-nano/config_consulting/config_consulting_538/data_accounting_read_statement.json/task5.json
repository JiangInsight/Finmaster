Since the provided data does not explicitly label any assets as \"held for sale,\" but we are given information on inventories and non-current assets over different dates, we need to interpret whether any assets might meet these criteria.\n\nIn this context:\n\n- Inventory at both dates appears to relate to assets in the process of being manufactured or held for sale.\n- Fixed assets are stable and do not seem to be assets held for sale unless specified.\n- The change in inventory values can reflect assets in production or in sale process if the context suggests so.\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- Inventory initial value = 0.00\n- Inventory end value = 174,000.00\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Total current assets initial = 8,000,000.00\n- Total current assets end = 10,022,038.12\n\nAnd the cash, bank deposits, receivables, are not classified as assets held for sale.\n\nAlso, non-current assets are stable or decreasing slightly, but no indication they are assets held for sale.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable assumption is that the \"Inventory\" line item is the asset in question, which is held in the process of manufacturing or in sale, especially given its initial and final values.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n- Initial value of assets held for sale (inventory in process) = 0.00\n- Final value = 174,000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"174000.00\"}}\n```",
