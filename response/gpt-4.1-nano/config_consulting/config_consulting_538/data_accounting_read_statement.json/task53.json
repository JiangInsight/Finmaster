This amount represents the carrying amount of inventories that were sold during the period, as it reflects the value of inventory that was transferred from the balance sheet's inventory asset to expense on the income statement.\n\nIn the provided income statement, the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is listed as 1,312,000.00.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n1. Locate the income statement section.\n2. Identify \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n3. Record its value, which reflects the carrying amount of inventories sold during the period.\n\n**Answer:**\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1312000.00'} }",
