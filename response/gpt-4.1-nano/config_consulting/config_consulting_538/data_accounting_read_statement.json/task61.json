The costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers.\n2. The cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment, and other long-term assets.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identifying the costs to secure and deliver customer orders:\n\n- In the **income statement**, typical line items related to costs to secure and deliver goods/services are:\n  - Selling Expenses\n  - Cost of Goods Sold (sometimes considered the cost to deliver goods)\n  \n- The description specifically asks for:\n  - Costs incurred to secure customer orders\n  - Costs to deliver the goods and services\n  \nIn financial statements, **Selling Expenses** generally encompass costs to secure orders (like marketing, sales commissions) and to deliver (such as shipping, delivery).\n\n**For the second problem:**\n\n- **First value:** Selling Expenses  \n- **From the second problem:** Selling Expenses = 345311.74\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment, and other long-term assets:\n\n- In the **cash flow statement**, under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" the line \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" indicates cash payments for property, plant, and equipment.\n\n- **From the second problem:**\n\n  - Purchase of Fixed Assets = 0.00\n  \nThus:\n- **Second value:** Purchase of Fixed Assets  \n- **Value:** 0.00\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"345311.74\", \"value2\": \"0.00\"}}\n```\n\nThis aligns with the instructions for extracting the required line items and their values.",
