                        "content": "Let's carefully calculate each ratio step by step.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\n**Using data:**  \nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 116,257.19  \nTotal Current Liabilities = 967,271.87\n\n**Calculation:**  \n116,257.19 / 967,271.87 ≈ 0.12\n\n---\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities / Total Debt\n\n**Data:**  \nTotal Debt = Total Current Liabilities + Non-current Liabilities (which are not explicitly detailed, but customary practice indicates considering total liabilities, i.e., total liabilities = total current liabilities + total non-current liabilities).  \nFrom the balance sheet, total liabilities = total liabilities and owner’s equity - owner’s equity \n\nTotal liabilities include:  \n- Current liabilities = 967,271.87  \n- Non-current liabilities: Since no specific non-current liabilities are provided, the total liabilities are implied as roughly the difference in total liabilities and owner's equity.  \nBut to stay accurate, total liabilities are:  \nTotal Liabilities + Owner's Equity = Total Assets (since accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity).  \n- Total Assets on end date: 14,930,535.06  \n- Owner's Equity: 13,963,263.19  \n- Therefore, total liabilities = Total Assets - Owner's Equity = 14,930,535.06 - 13,963,263.19 ≈ 967,271.87 (which matches total current liabilities, implying no non-current liabilities are explicitly detailed)\n\n**Net Cash flow:** 116,257.19  \n**Total Debt:** 967,271.87\n\n**Calculation:**  \n116,257.19 / 967,271.87 ≈ 0.12\n\n---\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\n**Data:**  \nCost of Goods Sold = 1,312,000.00  \nBeginning Inventory (from previous period) = 174,000.00  \nEnding Inventory = 174,000.00\n\n**Average Inventory:** (since we are only given the ending inventory, assume it is constant or use the given ending inventory as a representative figure)\n\nAverage Inventory ≈ 174,000.00\n\n**Calculation:**  \n1,312,000 / 174,000 ≈ 7.54\n\n---\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Equity\n\n**Data:**  \nTotal Debt = Total liabilities (967,271.87)  \nTotal Owner's Equity = 13,963,263.19\n\n**Calculation:**  \n967,271.87 / 13,963,263.19 ≈ 0.07\n\n---\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nQuick Ratio = (Cash + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n\n**Data:**  \nCash & Bank Deposits = 3,537,257.19 + 4,579,000.00 = 8,116,257.19  \nInterest Receivable = 14,869.76  \nAccounts Receivable = 1,716,911.17  \nTotal quick assets = 8,116,257.19 + 14,869.76 + 1,716,911.17 = 9,848,038.10\n\nLiabilities = 967,271.87\n\n**Calculation:**  \n9,848,038.10 / 967,271.87 ≈ 10.18\n\n---\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nCurrent Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\n**Data:**  \nTotal Current Assets = 10,022,038.12  \nTotal Current Liabilities = 967,271.87\n\n**Calculation:**  \n10,022,038.12 / 967,271.87 ≈ 10.37\n\n---\n\n## Final answers in requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"0.12\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"0.12\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"7.54\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.07\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"10.18\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"10.37\"\n  }\n}\n```",
