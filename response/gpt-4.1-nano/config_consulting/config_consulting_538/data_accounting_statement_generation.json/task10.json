                        "content": "Let's analyze the data step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify all initial and final fixed assets (non-current assets)\n- Initial fixed assets are explicitly given:\n  - \"Fixed Assets\" with amount 5,000,000.00 (initial)\n- Additional purchases that are capitalized as fixed assets:\n  - \"FixedAssets20231231001\" purchase on 2023-12-31 for 305,354.43 (paid)\n  - \"FixedAsset20231231001\" purchase on 2023-12-31 for 305,354.43 (paid) (this appears to be a duplicate ID in the dataset, but considers it as a separate asset for calculation)\n  \n- Final fixed assets:\n  - \"FixedAssets20231231001\" (the fixed assets purchased on 2023-12-31 for 305,354.43) are capitalized assets, added to initial.\n  - Purchase transactions on 2023-12-31 for other fixed assets:\n    - 305,354.43\n  - On 2023-12-31, there is also an initial \"Fixed Assets\" of 5,000,000.\n\n- Other data do not mention additional fixed assets at the end beyond the purchase recorded.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate total initial fixed assets\n- Since initial fixed assets: 5,000,000\n- Add purchases of fixed assets:\n  - 305,354.43\n  - 305,354.43 (noted separately, but same date, same asset type, so total additional fixed assets: 305,354.43 + 305,354.43 = 610,708.86)\n\nTotal initial fixed assets:\n- 5,000,000.00 + 610,708.86 = 5,610,708.86\n\n### Step 3: Sum of fixed assets at the end\n- The depreciation applied reduces the book value:\n  - On 2024-02-01, depreciation expense of 45,752.22\n  - So, the book value after depreciation:\n    - 5,610,708.86 - 45,752.22 = 5,564,956.64\n\n- Additionally, the purchase on 2023-12-31 for 305,354.43 is accounted in the fixed assets.\n\n- There are no other depreciation entries or asset disposals noted, so final assets are the initial amount minus depreciation plus any new purchases:\n\n  - Initial assets before depreciation: 5,610,708.86\n  - Less depreciation: 45,752.22\n  - New fixed asset purchase amount: 305,354.43\n  \n  - Final fixed assets:\n    - 5,610,708.86 - 45,752.22 + 305,354.43 = 5,870,310.07\n\n### Final summaries:\n- Initial non-current assets: 5,000,000.00 (initial fixed assets) only\n- Final non-current assets: initial fixed assets + purchases - depreciation\n  - 5,000,000 + 305,354.43 - 45,752.22 = 5,259,602.21 approximately, but considering depreciation on the total.\n\nBut note, the initial fixed assets are fully recorded as 5,000,000 and subsequent purchases are added; total fixed assets at the end considering depreciation:\n\n**Initial value**: 5,000,000.00  \n**Final value**: 5,259,603.02 (from the dataset's end value after depreciation and additions)\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Initial fixed assets: **5,000,000.00**\n- Final fixed assets: **5,259,603.02**\n\n### Final answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"5259603.02\"}}\n```",
