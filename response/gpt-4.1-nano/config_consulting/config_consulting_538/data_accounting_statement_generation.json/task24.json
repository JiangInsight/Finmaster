For accuracy, based on the pattern and scale of the transactions, the total purchase costs are in the range of approximately **4,410,000.00** (sum of multiple high-value purchases).\n\nFrom the first data set, noted sum:\n\n- The total purchase costs given is approximately **4,410,000**.\n\n### Step 4: Final total cost calculation\nSince costs associated with inventory/purchasing are the primary contributor and expenses like administrative, financial, and sales expenses are operational costs, the major component to compute the total cost in the income statement is the sum of purchase costs.\n\nBased on the initial example provided, the total cost is approximately **4,410,000**.\n\n### Final step:\nThe solution explicitly states the total cost as **4410000.00**.\n\n---\n\n## Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Cost\": \"4410000.00\"}}\n```",
