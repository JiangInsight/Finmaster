If greater, an increase (a cash outflow).\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Sum of all unpaid accounts receivable at the start** (Beginning balance)  \nThe dataset lists multiple records with \"Unpaid\" status and \"Account Receivable\" as receive_method.  \nWe'll sum their \"after_tax_amount\" to find the starting A/R balance.\n\n**Unpaid Accounts Receivable and their after_tax_amounts:**  \n- Sale 2024-01-03 (C010): 31456.16  \n- Sale 2024-01-04 (C004): 274663.86  \n- Sale 2024-01-08 (C002): 238740.93  \n- Sale 2024-01-12 (C014): 115401.58  \n- Sale 2024-01-14 (C008): 23443.13  \n- Sale 2024-01-19 (C011): 59906.52  \n- Sale 2024-01-22 (C017): 64583.68  \n- Sale 2024-01-23 (C015): 52078.01  \n- Sale 2024-01-24 (C014): 115401.58  \n- Sale 2024-01-25 (C008): 118704.88  \n- Sale 2024-01-29 (C002): 220302.45  \n- Sale 2024-01-30 (C019): 205584.96  \n- Sale 2024-01-31 (C019): 229109.86  \n- Sale 2024-02-05 (C007): 39451.51\n\nTotal unpaid receivable amount at the start (before new sales):  \n= 31456.16 + 274663.86 + 238740.93 + 115401.58 + 23443.13 + 59906.52 + 64583.68 + 52078.01 + 115401.58 + 118704.88 + 220302.45 + 205584.96 + 229109.86 + 39451.51  \n= 1,425,408.69\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Sum of all unpaid accounts receivable at the end** (Ending balance)  \nCurrent unpaid receivables at the end of period:  \n- Sale 2024-02-04 (C005): 11301.97  \n- Sale 2024-02-05 (C007): 39451.51\n\nRemaining unpaid total: 11301.97 + 39451.51 = 50753.48\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the change in A/R**  \nChange = Ending balance - Beginning balance  \n= 50,753.48 - 1,425,408.69  \n= -1,374,655.21\n\nBut note that for the cash flow statement, an increase in accounts receivable is a cash outflow (negative), a decrease is a cash inflow (positive). In reporting, the typical convention is:\n\n**(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable** = Final A/R - Initial A/R\n\nSince the initial A/R was higher, and now it's lower, the change is negative.\n\n**Final calculation:**  \n*(Decrease in A/R)* = -1,374,655.21\n\n**Answer in required format:**  \n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-1374655.21\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The detailed transaction assessments support that accounts receivable decreased by approximately **1,374,655.21** over the period.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-1374655.21\"}}\n```",
