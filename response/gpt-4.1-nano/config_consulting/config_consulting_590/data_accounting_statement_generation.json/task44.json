Search for transactions labeled as fixed asset purchases, identified by \"Fixed Assets\" or similar descriptions.\n2. From the provided data, there is a clear transaction:\n   - On 2023-12-31, a transaction labeled \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" with an amount of 305354.43, paid via Bank Transfer, with the asset being \"Storage Facilities\".\n3. This is the only fixed asset purchase transaction explicitly indicating acquisition of fixed assets paid in cash or bank transfer.\n4. Since the question asks for the amount in the cash flow statement for the purchase of fixed assets, we consider only the cash payment associated with acquiring fixed assets.\n\nTherefore, the final purchase of fixed assets in cash is **305,354.43**.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"305354.43\"}}\n```",
