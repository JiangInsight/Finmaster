The purchase prices vary around 100,000 per unit, with minor differences. To get accurate cost, use the most recent, or average unit price from bulk purchases.\n\nFrom the last Purchase of P001 (2023-12-31): 145,000 units at 50,000 each indicates approximate cost per unit: 50,000.\n\nEarlier, units purchased are consistent at 100,000 each.\n\nAssumption: The cost per unit for P001 (Chemical Product A) is approximately 100,000.\n\n- Product P002 (Chemical Product B): Multiple purchases at 20000 per unit generally, with some at 20000, some at 10000.\n\nFrom latest entries:\n\n  - Purchase20231231005: 200 units at 100,000 -> perhaps a different context.\n\n  - Also, earlier, purchases show 20,000 per unit.\n\nGiven the data, we can assume average purchase cost per unit for P002 around 20,000.\n\n- Product P003 (Chemical Product C): Purchased at around 50,000 to 70,000 per unit:\n\n  - For example, latest purchase: 290,000 units at 50,000 each (Dec 31), which is 50,000 per unit.\n\n  - Some lot at 50,000, some at 100,000 observed, but mostly around 50-100 thousand.\n\n- Product P004 (Chemical Product D): Purchase price appears to be around 100,000 per unit.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate COGS for each sale**\n\nNow, for each sale, use the estimated unit cost.\n\n- P001 (Chemical Product A): approx 100,000 per unit.\n- P002 (Chemical Product B): approx 20,000 per unit.\n- P003 (Chemical Product C): approx 50,000 per unit.\n- P004 (Chemical Product D): approx 100,000 per unit.\n\nCalculate total cost for each sale:\n\n1.
