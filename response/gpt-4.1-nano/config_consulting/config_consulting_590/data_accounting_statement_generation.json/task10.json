                        "content": "Let's analyze the transactions step by step to determine the initial and final amounts of the property, plant, and non-current assets.\n\nStep 1: Identify initial non-current assets:\n- The initial data shows:\n  - Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00\n  - Fixed Assets Purchase (2023-12-31): 305,354.43\n  - Storage Facilities Purchase (2023-12-31): 1,150,000.00\n  - Other property purchases (various dates): \n    - S009: 220,000.00\n    - S010: 305,354.43\n    - S006: 200,000.00\n    - Also, accumulated depreciation (on some assets) needs to be considered.\n\nStep 2: Aggregate initial property, plant, and equipment:\n- Initial property, plant, and equipment as of 2023-12-31:\n  - From initial data:\n    - Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00\n  - Plus purchases on or before 2023-12-31:\n    - 305,354.43 (Purchase, S010)\n    - 1150000.00 (Purchase, S006)\n    - 220,000.00 (Purchase, S009)\n    - 305,354.43 (Purchase, S001)\n  \n  Total initial non-current assets:\n  = 5,000,000 + 305,354.43 + 1,150,000 + 220,000 + 305,354.43\n  = 5,000,000 + 305,354.43 + 1,150,000 + 220,000 + 305,354.43\n  = 7,000,000 + 855,062.86\n  = 7,855,062.86\n\nBut note: the initial Fixed Assets are already 5 million, and the purchase records add to that total. Since the initial \"Fixed Assets\" of 5 million is likely a summary, and subsequent records indicate additional investments and purchases, we can sum all identified assets up to the date.\n\nStep 3: Consider depreciation:\n- Depreciation established on 2024-01-01 and onwards:\n  - Depreciation as of 2024-01-01: 45,751.41\n  - Additional depreciation on 2024-02-01: 45,744.93\n\nTotal accumulated depreciation (by the latest date): 45,751.41 + 45,744.93 = 91,496.34 (approximate; only these are explicit).\n\nStep 4: Final value calculation:\n- Total property values after considering additions and depreciation:\nInitial total property value (per above): ~7,855,062.86\n- Additions (2024 purchases):\n  - Fixed Asset Purchase (2023-12-31): 305,354.43\n  - Storage Facilities: 305,354.43\n  - Other purchases:\n    - 220,000 + 1,150,000 + 305,354.43 + 200,000 = 1,875,354.43\n  - Sum of recent large purchases: 305,354.43 + 305,354.43 + 220,000 + 1,150,000 + 200,000 = 2,180,708.86\n\nTotal assets sum (initial + purchases): \n- From above: 7,855,062.86 (initial fixed assets sum) + 2,180,708.86 \n≈ 10,035,771.72\n\nRemove accumulated depreciation (~91,496.34):\n- Final estimated value ≈ 10,035,771.72 - 91,496.34 ≈ 9,944,275.38\n\nBut considering only the provided data and the most explicit asset purchases, the original initial amount is primarily the 'Fixed Assets' of 5,000,000. On the other hand, the latest property, plant & equipment (PP&E) total value appears to be around 2025-01-31 to 2024-01-31 properties totaling approximately 5,259,603.02 (from the problem data).\n\nGiven the problem's solution format and previous pattern observed, the initial value is based on the original fixed assets (5 million), and the final value includes all subsequent additions minus depreciation. The data implies an initial of 5,000,000, and final of approximately 5,259,603.02, reflecting the assets after investment and depreciation.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"5259603.02\"}}\n```",
