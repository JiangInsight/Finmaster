                        "content": "Let's analyze the given data step-by-step to calculate each financial ratio.\n\n### Step 1: Extract data for calculations\n\n#### Balance Sheet Data (End amounts as of 2024-02-05)\n- Total Assets = 14,799,664.61\n- Total Liabilities:\n  - Accounts Payable = 462,000\n  - Taxes Payable = 169,880.98\n  - Total Current Liabilities = 631,880.98\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,167,783.63\n- Total Liabilities = Total Liabilities + Owner's Equity \n  = 631,880.98 + 14,167,783.63 = 14,799,664.61\n\n*Note:* Total Liabilities (including all current liabilities) = Total liabilities.\n\nTotal liabilities = 631,880.98 (current liabilities). Since total liabilities and ownerâ€™s equity sum to total assets, the total liabilities are verified as 631,880.98 for the purpose of ratio, but typically, total liabilities include both current and non-current. Here, only current liabilities are specified; non-current liabilities are not provided, so we proceed with this.\n\n- Owner's Equity = 14,167,783.63\n\n- Net Profit = 1,167,783.63\n- Total Revenue = 3,397,619.40\n\n- Accounts Receivable (End Amount) = 2,902,136.39\n\n#### Income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1,167,783.63\n- Total Revenue = 3,397,619.40\n\n#### Cash flow (for ROA and receivables turnover):\n- Net Profit (cash basis) is provided as 1,167,783.63.\n\n### Step 2: Calculations\n\n#### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Owner's Equity}}\n\\]\n\nBased on total liabilities = 631,880.98, Owner's Equity = 14,167,783.63\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{631,880.98}{14,167,783.63} \\approx 0.0446\n\\]\n\nExpressed in standard form, roughly 0.045, but to match the previous example's style:\n\n**Result:** 0.04 or 4%. Let's keep it precise:\n\n**Debt to Equity Ratio:** 0.04\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\\[\n\\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1,167,783.63}{3,397,619.40} \\times 100 \\approx 34.39\\%\n\\]\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n\\[\n\\text{ROA} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\times 100\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1,167,783.63}{14,799,664.61} \\times 100 \\approx 7.89\\%\n\\]\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n\\]\n\nSince only the end amount is provided, assume the initial receivables were zero (or consider the value as the average, given data limitations).\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{3,397,619.40}{2,902,136.39} \\approx 1.17\n\\]\n\n*However, in the previous example, the turnover ratio was about 4.47, so this seems reasonable considering the receivables are roughly 85% of assets, but the ratio is less because revenue is lower as compared to receivables. We'll stick with this calculation.*\n\n### Final result:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.04\",\n  \"Net Profit Margin\": \"34.39%\",\n  \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"7.89%\",\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"1.17\"\n}}\n```\n\n**Note:** Rounded to two decimal places for ratios and percentage.",
