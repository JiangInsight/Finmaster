                        "content": "Let's analyze the data step by step to compute each ratio.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio (ARTO)\n\n**Formula:**  \n\\[ \\text{ARTO} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\n- Assumption: All revenue is credit sales since no cash sales info is given.\n- Net credit sales (from income statement): 3,397,619.40\n- Accounts receivable at beginning (2023-12-31): 0.00  \n- Accounts receivable at end (2024-02-05): 2,902,136.39\n\n**Average Accounts Receivable:**  \n\\[ \\frac{0 + 2,902,136.39}{2} = 1,451,068.20 \\]\n\n**ARTO:**  \n\\[ \\frac{3,397,619.40}{1,451,068.20} \\approx 2.34 \\]\n\n---\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n- Net cash flow from operating activities: -1,368,775.90\n- Current liabilities end (2024-02-05): 631,880.98\n\n**Ratio:**  \n\\[ \\frac{-1,368,775.90}{631,880.98} \\approx -2.17 \\]\n\n---\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nThis ratio is similar to the above but sometimes refers specifically to liquidity ratio, but based on context, it's the same as cash flow to current liabilities:\n\n**Same as above:**  \nApproximately **-2.17**\n\n---\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\n- Total revenue: 3,397,619.40\n- Total assets at start: 13,000,000.00\n- Total assets at end: 14,799,664.61\n\n**Average Total Assets:**  \n\\[ \\frac{13,000,000 + 14,799,664.61}{2} = 13,899,832.31 \\]\n\n**Total Asset Turnover:**  \n\\[ \\frac{3,397,619.40}{13,899,832.31} \\approx 0.24 \\]\n\n---\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\n- Total liabilities = Total current liabilities + total non-current liabilities (unknown directly).\n- From balance sheet:\n  - Total current liabilities: 631,880.98\n  - Total liabilities include accounts payable and taxes payable, but no long-term debt specified.\n  - We consider total liabilities as the sum of current liabilities if no other info given.\n\n- Total ownerâ€™s equity end: 14,167,783.63\n\n- Total liabilities end:  \n\\[ \\text{Total Liabilities} = 631,880.98 \\]\n\n**Debt to Equity:**  \n\\[ \\frac{631,880.98}{14,167,783.63} \\approx 0.045 \\]\n\nHowever, since liabilities are very minimal compared to equity, the ratio is approximately 0.045.\n\n---\n\n### Final answers:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"2.34\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-2.17\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-2.17\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.24\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.045\"\n  }\n}\n```\nThis provides a detailed step-by-step reasoning and the final calculations.",
