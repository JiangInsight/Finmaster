Calculate Gross Profit Margin:**\nGross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100%\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 2,060,619.40\n- Total Revenue = 3,397,619.40\n\nGross Profit Margin = (2,060,619.40 / 3,397,619.40) * 100%  \n= 0.6069 * 100% ≈ **60.69%**\n\n**2. Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:**\n- First, identify the net cash flow from operating activities:  \n  Net cash flow from operating activities = -1,368,775.90\n\n- Next, determine total debt, which is generally total liabilities:  \n  From the balance sheet:  \n  Total Current Liabilities = 631,880.98  \n  Total Non-current Liabilities are not explicitly given, but since only current liabilities are specified under liabilities, it seems total liabilities = current liabilities = 631,880.98\n\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt\n\n= -1,368,775.90 / 631,880.98 ≈ -2.17\n\nExpressed as a ratio, approximately **-2.17**\n\n**Final answers:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Gross Profit Margin\": \"60.69%\", \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-2.17\"}}\n```",
