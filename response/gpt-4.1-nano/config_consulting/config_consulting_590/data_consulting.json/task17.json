However, in this dataset, specific liabilities labeled 'Debt' are not explicitly provided.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the relevant debt**\n\nIn the balance sheet, the **liabilities** and **owner's equity** are present. Since interest-bearing liabilities are not explicitly distinguished, the most logical approach is to consider **Total liabilities** as a proxy for total debt.\n\n- From balance sheet, the only liability data is:\n\n| Account | End_amount | End_date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Total Current Liabilities | 631,880.98 | 2024-02-05 |\n\n- Non-current liabilities are not explicitly provided, but since total liabilities are not directly listed, and the only liabilities detailed are current liabilities, we will proceed with **Total Current Liabilities** as an approximation of total debt.\n\n**Step 3: Extract the figures**\n\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: from cash flow statement, it's **-1,368,775.90**\n- **Total Debt (approximated by current liabilities)**: **631,880.98**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the ratio**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-1,368,775.90}{631,880.98} \\approx -2.169\n\\]\n\nExpressed as a ratio, it is approximately **-2.17** when rounded to two decimal places.\n\n**Step 5: Present in required JSON format**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-2.17\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-2.17\"}}\n```",
