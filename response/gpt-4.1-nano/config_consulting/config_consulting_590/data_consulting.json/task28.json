Debt to Asset Ratio\n- Total Assets (End of period): 14,799,664.61\n- Total Liabilities (Liabilities are given in current liabilities; total liabilities include both current liabilities and long-term liabilities if any, but in this case, only current liabilities are shown):\n  - Accounts Payable: 462,000\n  - Taxes Payable: 169,880.98\n  - Total Liabilities: 631,880.98\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets = 631,880.98 / 14,799,664.61 ≈ 0.0427 or 4.27%\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n- Gross Profit: 2,060,619.40\n- Total Revenue: 3,397,619.40\n\nGross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Total Revenue = 2,060,619.40 / 3,397,619.40 ≈ 0.6068 or 60.68%\n\n*(Note: The previous solution example shows margins as a percentage; to align, we'll present it as a percentage with two decimal points.)*\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -1,368,775.90\n- Average Total Assets (approximate, since only end balance is given, we take that as representative): 14,799,664.61\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Operating Cash Flow / Total Assets = -1,368,775.90 / 14,799,664.61 ≈ -0.0925 or -9.25%\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '4.27%', 'Gross Profit Margin': '60.68%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-9.25%'}}\n```",
