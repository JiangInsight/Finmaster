The **Current Liabilities** at the end date are given as **631,880.98**.\n3. The **Current Ratio** is calculated by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nCalculations:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9,891,156.92}{631,880.98} \\approx 15.66\n\\]\n\nThe ratio indicates that the company has approximately 15.66 times more current assets than current liabilities, which suggests strong liquidity.\n\nNow, presenting the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Current Ratio\": \"15.66\"}}\n```",
