Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit (Accounts Receivable).\n2. Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation (Financial Expenses).\n3. Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets (Purchase of Fixed Assets).\n\n**Step 1: Identify Accounts Receivable (Amounts owed for goods/services sold on credit)**  \nIn the balance sheet, the relevant line item is \"Accounts Receivable.\"  \nFrom the input, End_amount on 2024-02-05 is **2902136.39**.  \nThis represents the amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Financial Expenses (Financing costs incurred to raise funds)**  \nIn the income statement, \"Financial Expenses\" is listed with an amount of **54544.72** on 2024-02-05.  \nThis corresponds to financing costs.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Purchase of Fixed Assets (Cash payments for property, plant, equipment)**  \nIn the cash flow from investing activities, \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" shows an amount of **0.00** on 2024-02-05, indicating no cash outflow for acquisition of property, plant, and equipment during this period.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Value for amounts owed (Accounts Receivable): **2902136.39**  \n- Value for financing costs (Financial Expenses): **54544.72**  \n- Value for property, plant, and equipment purchases (Purchase of Fixed Assets): **0.00**\n\nNow, prepare the final answer in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"2902136.39\", \"value2\": \"54544.72\", \"value3\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
