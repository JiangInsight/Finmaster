                        "content": "Let's analyze the given financial statements step-by-step to identify the required line items:\n\n1. **From the income statement**, the key item is:\n   - Total income from the course of ordinary activities, which is the **Net Profit**.\n\n2. **From the cash flow statement**, the principal revenue-producing activities are reflected by:\n   - Cash flow from operating activities. The net cash flow from operating activities indicates the cash generated or used from core business operations. The **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities** is the primary measure here.\n\n3. **From the balance sheet**, the specific line item related to cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities is \"Cash and Cash Equivalents.\" Since we are asked for the end value (closing balance) of cash and cash equivalents, the relevant line is the **Ending Balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents**.\n\n4. **Taxes accrued but not yet paid** are directly given as **Taxes Payable**.\n\n**Summarizing:**\n- Income Statement: Total income arising in ordinary activities = **Net Profit**\n- Cash Flow Statement: Cash flow from principal activities = **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**\n- Balance Sheet: End value of cash and cash equivalents = **Cash and Cash Equivalents (Ending Balance)**\n- Taxes accrued but not paid = **Taxes Payable**\n\nNow, extracting the specific numbers from the relevant sections of the latest data:\n\n- **Net Profit (Income Statement)** = 1,167,783.63\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities (Cash Flow Statement)** = -1,368,775.90\n- **Ending Balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents (Balance Sheet)** = 6,631,224.10\n- **Taxes Payable (Balance Sheet)** = 169,880.98\n\nFinally, presenting the answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"169880.98\", \"value2\": \"1167783.63\", \"value3\": \"-1368775.90\"}}\n```\n\n**Note:** The order specified is:\n1. Balance Sheet - Taxes Payable\n2. Income Statement - Net Profit\n3. Cash Flow Statement - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\nThis matches the provided example format and the instructions.",
