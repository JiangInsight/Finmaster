Typically, accounts payable reflects amounts owed for credit purchases.\n\nStep 1: Examine the \"Accounts Payable\" account:\n- Initial amount: 0.00\n- End amount: 462,000.00\n\nStep 2: Confirm there are no other accounts representing liabilities for credit purchases:\n- Taxes Payable is related to taxes, not purchases.\n- Other liabilities are not listed.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, the change in \"Accounts Payable\" represents the amounts owed for goods or services bought on credit during the period.\n\nFinal conclusion:\n- Initial value of accounts payable at the start: 0.00\n- Final value of accounts payable at the end: 462,000.00\n\nAnswer in the required format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '462000.00'} }\n```",
