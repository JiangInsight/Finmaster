The task is to identify the specific line item and value of \"carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period\" from the provided financial statements.\n\n2. The key clue is in the income statement where \"Cost of Goods Sold\" appears, as this represents the carrying amount of inventory items that were sold.\n\n3. In the provided income statement for the second dataset, the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is listed as 1,337,000.00.\n\n4. There are no additional details, such as inventory movement or other notes, indicating any adjustments or specific inventory sale figures other than the \"Cost of Goods Sold.\" Usually, in financial statements, the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) is the relevant line item representing the carrying amount of inventories sold.\n\nTherefore, the required value is the amount listed under \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1337000.00'} }",
