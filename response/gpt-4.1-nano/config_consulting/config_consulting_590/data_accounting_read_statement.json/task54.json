Often, the question aims for the specific expenses directly linked to customer acquisition and delivery costs, which would be Selling Expenses (to secure orders) and Cost of Goods Sold (to deliver).\n\nSince the example solution only references a single value, it's likely the intended answer is the Selling Expenses as the specific amount incurred to secure orders and deliver services.\n\nTherefore, the value to extract is: **319828.12**\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '319828.12'}}\n```",
