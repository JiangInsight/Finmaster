Look at the balance sheet section:\n   - Accounts Payable at the start (Initial_amount, 2023-12-31): 0.00\n   - Accounts Payable at the end (End_amount, 2024-02-05): 462,000.00\n\n2. Since the initial balance was zero and the ending balance increased to 462,000.00, this indicates that the entity has accumulated additional payables during the period, corresponding to purchases on credit.\n\n3. The increase in accounts payable from 0.00 to 462,000.00 during the period reflects new credit purchases.\n\n4. The cash flow statement confirms this pattern:\n   - Increase in Accounts Payable: 462,000.00 (positive, indicating an addition)\n\nTherefore, the specific line item representing the addition to amounts owed for goods or services received on credit is \"Accounts Payable\" with a value of 462,000.00.\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"462000.00\"}}\n```",
