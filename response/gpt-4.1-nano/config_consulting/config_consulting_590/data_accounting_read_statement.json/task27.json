                        "content": "To solve this, I need to identify the line item that represents the accumulated systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life, which is the typical definition of accumulated depreciation.\n\nIn the provided income statement, the relevant line item is \"Depreciation,\" which usually refers to the expense for the period, and \"Accumulated depreciation\" would represent the total depreciation allocated to date. However, in this statement, only \"Depreciation\" for the period is listed, not accumulated depreciation.\n\nGiven the task and the example provided, the answer must be the specific line item from the table that indicates the accumulated systematic allocationâ€”here. Since only \"Depreciation\" is listed, and there's no explicit mention of accumulated depreciation, the most relevant line for accumulated depreciation is the \"Depreciation\" expense for the period.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- In income statements, \"Depreciation\" typically refers to the depreciation expense for the period, which is a part of accumulated depreciation.\n- If the statement provided was for a specific period, the total accumulated depreciation would be at a previous reporting period plus current period depreciation.\n- The problem explicitly asks for the line item that reflects the systematic allocation over its useful life, which is usually the \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line, but since it is absent, the closest match is the current period \"Depreciation.\"\n\nTherefore, the value to extract is **\"91492.31\"**.\n\n**Answer:**\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91492.31'} }",
