The relevant line items for credit purchases or the increase in owed amounts are typically \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n2. In the provided data, \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" shows the change in the amount owed to suppliers based on credit transactions.\n3. For this period, the change in accounts payable is 462,000.00, indicating an increase in what the entity owes for goods or services received on credit.\n\nTherefore, the amount of addition in the amount owed due to credit purchases during the period is 462,000.00.\n\nAnswer: \"462000.00\"\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '462000.00'} }\n```",
