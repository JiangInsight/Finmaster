A decrease in accounts receivable means that the entity has received cash for sales made on credit, reducing the amount owed.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and value are:\nLine item: (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\nValue: -2902136.39\n\nNow, formatting the answer in the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2902136.39'}}\n```",
