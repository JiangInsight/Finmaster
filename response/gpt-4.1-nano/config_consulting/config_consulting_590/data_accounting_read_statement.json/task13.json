We are asked to identify and extract line items of total assets that are **not expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle**. Essentially, this refers to **non-current assets** that are held for purposes other than immediate sale or consumption.\n\n2. In typical balance sheets, **fixed assets** (like property, plant, equipment) are non-current assets, but they are not intended for sale in the ordinary course; they are used in operations.\n\n3. **Accumulated depreciation** is a contra asset account linked to fixed assets, so it generally offsets the value of fixed assets.\n\n4. From the provided data:\n   - Initial value of Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00\n   - End value of Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00\n   - Initial value of Accumulated Depreciation: 0.00\n   - End value of Accumulated Depreciation: 91,492.31\n   - Total Non-current Assets initially: 5,000,000.00\n   - Total Non-current Assets at end: 4,908,507.69\n\n5. The initial and final values of Fixed Assets are consistent with the assets held for operational purposes, not for sale.\n\n6. Therefore, the relevant line items that are not expected to be realized or intended for sale within the operating cycle are:\n   - Fixed Assets\n   - Accumulated Depreciation (as a contra asset to Fixed Assets)\n\n7. Based on the example and context, the typical answer emphasizes **Fixed Assets** as the main line item.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe total value of fixed assets at the initial and final points clearly represents assets not intended for sale in the normal course but used in operations.\n\n**Answer:**\n{\n  \"initial value\": \"5000000.00\",\n  \"end value\": \"4908507.69\"\n}\n\nNow, formalizing the answer in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"5000000.00\", \"end value\": \"4908507.69\"}}\n```",
