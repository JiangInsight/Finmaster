                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided cash flow statement step by step to identify the four specific line items:\n\n1. The first item is \"the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life\".  \n   - Typically, this is represented by the \"Depreciation\" line item.\n\n2. The second item is \"reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period\".  \n   - This would be reflected in \"assets held for sale\" or similar line, but such line is not explicitly listed.\n   - Alternatively, the reduction in inventory (\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\") can relate to assets being sold or decreased.\n\n3. The third item is \"net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends\".  \n   - This involves cash flows from investing activities, especially acquisitions and disposals of long-term assets.  \n   - The relevant line here is \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n\n4. The fourth item is \"net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\".  \n   - This is directly provided by \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nFrom the problem statement and typical cash flow components, the expected mappings are:\n\n- Value1: Depreciation = 91492.31  \n- Value2: Reduction in assets held for sale or inventories = (Increase) Decrease in Inventory = -343000.00  \n- Value3: Cash flows from investing activities = Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -0.00  \n- Value4: Net increase in cash and cash equivalents = -1368775.90\n\nNow, prepare the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91492.31', 'value2': '-343000.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '-1368775.90'}}\n```",
