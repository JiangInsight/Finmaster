Review all asset line items.\n2. Determine which assets are likely to be held for sale or in production:\n   - Inventory is often associated with assets in production or ready for sale.\n   - Other categories like cash, receivables, fixed assets, are generally not assets held specifically for sale unless explicitly indicated (which it isn't here).\n3. Since \"Inventory\" is the most relevant for assets held for sale in the process, and as per accounting standards, inventory in production for sale or in process is included in this category.\n4. The initial inventory value was 0.00, and the end inventory is 343,000.00.\n5. These values reflect assets that are now in inventory and are consistent with assets held for sale or in the process.\n\nTherefore, the specific line items and their values related to assets held for sale (in inventory, in production, or in process) are:\n- **Initial value:** 0.00 (before the period started)\n- **Final value:** 343,000.00 (at the end of the period)\n\nFinal answer in the requested format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '343000.00'}}\n```",
