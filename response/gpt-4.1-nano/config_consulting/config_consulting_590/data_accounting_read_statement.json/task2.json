The decrease suggests some withdrawals or transfers out, but the amount initially deposited is the initial deposit, and the current amount is the final deposit value.\n\nTherefore, the solution is based on the \"Bank Deposits\" account's initial and end amounts.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"5000000.00\", \"end value\": \"4292000.00\"}}\n```",
