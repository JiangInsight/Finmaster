This account shows the amount of interest that has been earned but not yet collected or received.\n\nLet's analyze each problem:\n\n1. For the first dataset:\n- Initial amount: 0.00\n- End amount: 2672.87\n- Account: Interest Receivable\n\n2. For the second dataset:\n- Initial amount: 0.00\n- End amount: 14796.43\n- Account: Interest Receivable\n\nIn both cases, the initial value is zero, which indicates no accrued interest at the beginning, and the final amount shows the accrued interest not yet received.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"14796.43\"}}\n```",
