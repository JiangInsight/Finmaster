The two specific line items to identify are:\n   - Income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities (this typically refers to \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue\").\n   - Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period (this is typically \"Cost of Goods Sold\").\n\n2. For the first item, \"income arising in the course of core operating activities,\" the most appropriate line is \"Main Business Revenue\" as it indicates generated income from core operations.\n\n3. For the second item, \"carrying amount of inventories sold,\" the relevant line is \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\n4. Now, extract the values:\n   - Main Business Revenue: 3397619.40\n   - Cost of Goods Sold: 1337000.00\n\nAnswer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3397619.40', 'value2': '1337000.00'}}\n```",
