From the balance sheet, \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" at the end date is a typical reference, but since the task asks for \"the end value of net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities,\" the appropriate line is the change in cash (from the cash flow statement).\n\n**Cash Flow Statement:**\n- The \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" directly reflects the cash generated from the primary revenue-producing activities.\n- The end value of cash and cash equivalents is given under \"Ending Balance,\" which also shows the effect of the cash flow.\n\n**Income Statement:**\n- The total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities corresponds to \"Total Revenue.\"\n\n**Taxes Paid (accrued but not yet paid):**\n- The line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" in cash flow indicates the change in taxes payable. Since taxes payable at the end are given, and the change is indicated in cash flow, the accrued taxes that are not yet paid but recognized as expense are reflected in \"Tax Expense\" (from the income statement) or the change in \"Taxes Payable\" (from the balance sheet). The task asks specifically for the amount of taxes accrued but not yet paid, which aligns with the change in taxes payable during the period.\n\nNow, extracting the values for the solution:\n\n1. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities:**  \n   The relevant value is from the cash flow statement: **\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\"**, which is **-650,630.22**.\n\n2. **Total income arising in the course of an entity's ordinary activities:**  \n   From the income statement: **\"Total Revenue\"**, which is **2,869,560.42**.\n\n3. **Amount of taxes accrued but not yet paid:**  \n   From the cash flow statement: **\"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\"**, which is **143,478.02**.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"-650630.22\", \"value2\": \"2869560.42\", \"value3\": \"143478.02\"}}\n```",
