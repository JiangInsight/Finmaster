Locate \"Tax Expense\" in the income statement: it is 143,478.02.\n2. Confirm the \"Taxes Payable\" amount in the balance sheet: 143,478.02, aligning with the income statement.\n3. Note the change in \"Tax Payable\" during the period in the cash flow statement: 143,478.02, consistent with the above figures.\n4. The amount from \"Tax Expense\" is the expected tax payment/receipt for the reporting period.\n\n**Final answer:**\n{\"solution\": {'value': '143,478.02'}}\n(Note: The number format can be kept as shown. If the format excludes commas, it would be 143478.02.)",
