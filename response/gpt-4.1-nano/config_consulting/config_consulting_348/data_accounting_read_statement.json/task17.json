The amount owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit (Accounts Receivable).\n2. The amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit (Accounts Payable).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the line items related to credit sales and credit purchases**\n\n- **Accounts Receivable:** Represents amounts owed to the entity for sales made on credit.\n- **Accounts Payable:** Represents amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit.\n\n**Step 2: Extract the initial and ending values for these line items**\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- **Accounts Receivable:**\n  - Initial value: 0.00 (2023-12-31)\n  - End value: 2,149,792.45 (2024-02-05)\n\n- **Accounts Payable:**\n  - Initial value: 0.00 (2023-12-31)\n  - End value: 485,000.00 (2024-02-05)\n\n**Step 3: Confirm the order**\n\nThe instructions specify to maintain the original line item order, which is:\n\n1. Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit — **Accounts Receivable**\n2. Amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit — **Accounts Payable**\n\n---\n\n**Final answer in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value1\": \"0.00\", \"end valu1\": \"2149792.45\", \"initial value2\": \"0.00\", \"end valu2\": \"485000.00\"}}\n```",
