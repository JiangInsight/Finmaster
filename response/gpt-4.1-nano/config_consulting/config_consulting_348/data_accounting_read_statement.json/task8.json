Look for liability accounts related to credit purchase obligations.\n2. Identify their initial and final amounts.\n3. The relevant accounts are \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable.\"\n4. Extract the initial and end values for these accounts.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n- \"Accounts Payable\" initially was 0.00 and increased to 485,000.00.\n- \"Taxes Payable\" initially was 0.00 and increased to 143,478.02.\n\nSince the question asks specifically about amounts owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit, the most representative account is \"Accounts Payable.\"\n\nFinal answer:\n- Initial amount: 0.00\n- Final amount: 485,000.00\n\nPutting this into the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"485000.00\"}}\n```",
