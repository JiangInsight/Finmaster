Identify the net addition/decrease in cash and cash equivalents:\n\n- The relevant line is \"Net Increase\", which shows the net change in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n- From the data: \"Net Increase\" = -650,630.22\n\n2. Confirm the starting and ending balances:\n\n- Beginning Balance = 8,000,000.00\n- Ending Balance = 7,349,369.78\n\n3. Verify that the net increase matches the change between beginning and ending balances:\n\n- Change = Ending Balance - Beginning Balance = 7,349,369.78 - 8,000,000.00 = -650,630.22\n- This matches the \"Net Increase\" line, confirming consistency.\n\n4. Decompose the net change into two component sub-items:\n\n- These are generally the primary sources of cash flows, such as the \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" and \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n\n- From the data:\n  - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -650,630.22\n  - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -0.00\n\nSince the total net increase/decrease is the sum of these components, and both are identifiable, they form suitable sub-items.\n\n5. Final values of sub-items:\n\n- Sub-item 1: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -650,630.22\n- Sub-item 2: Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -0.00\n\n6. Final answer:\n\nNote: Although the cash flows from investing are zero, we still include them as components, per the task instructions.\n\nNow, present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-650,630.22\", \"sub_items_sub_item value1\": \"-650,630.22\", \"sub_items_sub_item value2\": \"-0.00\"}}\n```",
