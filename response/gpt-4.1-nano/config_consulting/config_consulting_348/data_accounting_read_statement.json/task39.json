                        "content": "To identify the line item and value of reduction in assets held for sale, we need to look for entries related to assets that are being reduced due to sale or disposal, especially those in the ordinary course of business, in production, or being manufactured.\n\nExamining the provided cash flow statement entries, the relevant details are:\n\n1. The total change in assets held for sale isn't explicitly listed.\n2. However, the key indicator of a reduction in such assets is the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" which often includes proceeds from the sale of assets or assets held for sale.\n3. In this case, the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is zero, and the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is -0.00, indicating no asset sale proceeds reported here.\n4. The balances for cash and cash equivalents show a significant decrease (~1.3 million), but this is related to operating activities and overall cash flow.\n\nGiven the structure and typical presentation, reductions related specifically to assets held for sale would often appear as proceeds from sale transactions within investing activities. Since no such transactions are explicitly shown, but there is a significant decrease in assets (reflected by the cash flow data and balance changes), the most relevant line item indicating asset reduction in the context of assets held for sale is not explicitly listed beyond the overall cash flows.\n\nConsidering the problem and the data provided, the critical reduction appears to be the net cash flow indicating a disposal or reduction of assets â€” but without explicit sale proceeds listed, the most relevant figure related to reduction of assets held for sale is:\n\n- The change in assets, which is indirectly indicated by the overall decrease in cash (though this isn't specific to assets held for sale).\n\nHowever, to align with the task's focus, the best extraction is the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" which, when negative, often corresponds to purchases of assets. Since the only investing activity is a zero value (no purchase), the actual reduction in assets holdings for sale would be reflected in asset write-offs or sale proceeds, which seem absent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe only explicit asset reduction figure involves a \"sale\" or \"disposal\" of assets, which, in this case, appears to be zero or not explicitly listed. But the question asks for the specific line item and value related to reduction of assets held for sale; if we interpret \"Reduction\" broadly, the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" would be the best indicator, unless specifically indicated.\n\n**Given this context, the most appropriate answer based on the data provided and task requirements is:**\n\n- The value related to asset disposals or reductions isn't explicitly listed.  \n- The closest relevant figure is the absence of cash inflow or outflow related to sale proceeds.\n\nWithout explicit sale details, the best estimate is that **no specific line item for asset sale exists**, meaning the reduction in assets held for sale during the period is zero.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'} }\n```",
