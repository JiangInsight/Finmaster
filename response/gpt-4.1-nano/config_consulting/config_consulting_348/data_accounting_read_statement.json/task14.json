The task requires identifying specific liabilities that are expected to be settled in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle.\n2. These liabilities typically include current liabilities, such as accounts payable and taxes payable, because they are payable within the normal operating cycle.\n3. Non-current liabilities (like long-term debt) are not included because they are settled outside the normal operating cycle.\n4. From the data, we see:\n   - Accounts Payable: initial 0.00, end 485,000.00\n   - Taxes Payable: initial 0.00, end 143,478.02\n5. Summing these liabilities:\n   - Initial total: 0.00 + 0.00 = 0.00\n   - End total: 485,000.00 + 143,478.02 = 628,478.02\n\nThus, the total liabilities expected to be settled in the normal course of the operating cycle are reflected at the end value of 628,478.02.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"628478.02\"}}\n```",
