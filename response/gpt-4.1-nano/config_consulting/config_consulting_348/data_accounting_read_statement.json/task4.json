In the provided problem, the relevant account is \"Interest Receivable.\" It records amounts of interest earned but not yet received.\n\nNext, examine the data:\n- Initial amount on 2023-12-31: 0.00\n- End amount on 2024-02-05: 14575.80\n\nSince the initial value is zero and the end value reflects the accumulated interest receivable at the close of the period, these values represent the initial and final balances of interest accrued but not yet received.\n\nTherefore, the initial amount is 0.00, and the final amount is 14575.80.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '14575.80'}}\n```",
