The question asks to identify and extract \"specific line items and value of total assets that are not expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle,\" including initial and final values.\n\n2. Such assets generally include non-current assets, idle, or fixed assets that are not actively being used or are not expected to be realized in the short term.\n\n3. Reviewing the given data, most assets are current assets and fixed/non-current assets.\n\n4. Fixed Assets and Total Non-current Assets are typically not expected to be realized or sold in the normal course unless the company intends to dispose of them.\n\n5. Initial and final values of \"Total Non-current Assets\" are provided:\n   - Initial: 5,000,000.00\n   - End: 4,908,490.75\n\n6. The other relevant line item is the total of the \"Total Assets\" which includes current and non-current assets, but the problem emphasizes non-current assets.\n\nGiven these observations, the specific line item of interest is \"Total Non-current Assets,\" with initial and final amounts.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '4908490.75'} }",
