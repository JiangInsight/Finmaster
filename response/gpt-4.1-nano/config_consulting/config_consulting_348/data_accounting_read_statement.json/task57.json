Since accounts payable increased from zero to 485,000.00, this indicates new credit obligations.\n\nStep 3: Cross-verify with cash flow statement for payments related to accounts payable.\n\n- Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable: 485,000.00\n\nThis confirms the increase specifically pertains to new liabilities created for goods or services received on credit during the period.\n\nThus, the line item representing the addition in the amount owed for credit purchases is \"Accounts Payable\" with a change of 485,000.00.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"485000.00\"}}",
