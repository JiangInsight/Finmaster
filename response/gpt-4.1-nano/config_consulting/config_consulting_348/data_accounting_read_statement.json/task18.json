Cash held by the entity that is available for use in its day-to-day operations:\n   - Typically, this is captured under \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits.\" These represent liquid funds readily available for operational purposes.\n   \n2. Tangible items held for use in production or supply of goods/services, for rental, or administrative purposes:\n   - This is commonly represented by \"Inventory\" and \"Fixed Assets.\" Inventory is for sale or production use, and Fixed Assets include property, plant, and equipment used in operations.\n\n3. The amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid:\n   - This is represented by \"Taxes Payable,\" both initially and at the end of the period.\n\nNow, examining the data:\n\n**From the first problem:**\n- Cash on Hand:\n  - Initial: 3,000,000.00\n  - End: 3057369.78\n- Bank Deposits:\n  - Initial: 5,000,000.00\n  - End: 4,292,000.00\n- Inventory:\n  - Initial: 0.00\n  - End: 112,000.00\n\n**From the second problem:**\n- Cash on Hand:\n  - Initial: 3,000,000.00\n  - End: 3,057,369.78\n- Bank Deposits:\n  - Initial: 5,000,000.00\n  - End: 4,292,000.00\n- Inventory:\n  - Initial: 0.00\n  - End: 112,000.00\n\n- Taxes Payable:\n  - Initial: 0.00\n  - End: 143,478.02\n\n### Final selection:\n\n- **Liquid cash for operations**:\n  - Initial: Cash on Hand: 3,000,000.00\n  - End: 3,057,369.78\n\n- **Tangible items used in operations**:\n  - Initial: Inventory: 0.00\n  - End: 112,000.00\n\n- **Tax accrued but not yet paid**:\n  - Initial: 0.00\n  - End: 143,478.02\n\n### Final answer in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"initial value1\": \"3000000.00\",\n  \"end valu1\": \"3057369.78\",\n  \"initial value2\": \"0.00\",\n  \"end valu2\": \"112000.00\",\n  \"initial value3\": \"0.00\",\n  \"end valu3\": \"143478.02\"\n}}\n```",
