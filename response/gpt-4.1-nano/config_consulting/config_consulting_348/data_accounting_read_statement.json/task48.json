The amount of profit retained (\"Net Profit\") after deducting all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization.  \n2. The cash payments made to acquire property, plant, and equipment, which is represented by \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the investing activities.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Find the \"Net Profit\"**\n\nFrom the table:\n\n| Account | Amount |\n| --- | --- |\n| Net Profit | 905750.76 |\n\n**Step 2: Find the cash payments for property, plant, and equipment**\n\n\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" indicates cash spent to acquire such assets:\n\n| Account | Amount |\n| --- | --- |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets | 0.00 |\n\nSo, the cash payments are zero, as no purchase was made during the period.\n\n---\n\n**Final result:**\n\n- Value of profit retained (Net Profit): 905750.76  \n- Value of cash payments for property, plant, and equipment: 0.00\n\n---\n\n**Answer in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"905750.76\", \"value2\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
