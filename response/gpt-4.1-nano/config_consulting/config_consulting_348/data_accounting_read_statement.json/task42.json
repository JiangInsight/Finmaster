Look at the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section.\n2. Find the line item that indicates purchase or acquisition of fixed assets or long-term assets.\n3. The relevant line in this data is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n4. The associated amount for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is 0.00, indicating no cash payments were made for acquiring property, plant, and equipment during this period.\n\nTherefore, the cash payment amount for acquiring property, plant, and equipment (and other long-term assets) is 0.00.\n\nAnswer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'} }\n```",
