The first item of interest is \"Income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities.\"  \n   Typically, this refers to the revenue generated from main business operations, which is often labeled as \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue.\"  \n   \n   In this case, the relevant line is \"Main Business Revenue\" with the amount 2,869,560.42.\n\n2. The second item of interest is \"carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\"  \n   This is typically represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).  \n   \n   Here, the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is 1,249,000.00.\n\n**Therefore, the two specific line items are:**\n\n- Income from core operating activities: **Main Business Revenue (2,869,560.42)**\n- Inventories sold (COGS): **Cost of Goods Sold (1,249,000.00)**\n\nThe answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"2869560.42\", \"value2\": \"1249000.00\"}}\n```\n",
