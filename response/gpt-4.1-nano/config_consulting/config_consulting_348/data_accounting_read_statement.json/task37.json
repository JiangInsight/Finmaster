This line directly refers to the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset.\n\nIt is standard practice to identify depreciation expense in cash flow statements as a non-cash expense added back to net income in operating activities, explicitly representing the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount.\n\nTherefore, the line item I need to extract is:\n- **Depreciation** with the value 91509.25.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"91509.25\"}}\n```",
