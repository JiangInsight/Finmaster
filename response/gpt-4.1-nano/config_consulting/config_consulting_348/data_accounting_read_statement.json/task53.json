(indicating an increase, not a sale).  \nThe cash flow statement shows a decrease in inventory of 112,000. during the period, which suggests inventory was sold.\n\nStep 3: Understand that the COGS (1249000.00) already accounts for the inventory sold during the period.  \nThe amount of inventory sold is represented by the COGS, which indicates the carrying amount of inventories that were sold during the period.\n\nTherefore, the line item value for the carrying amount of inventories sold is 1,249,000.00.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1249000.00'} }\n```",
