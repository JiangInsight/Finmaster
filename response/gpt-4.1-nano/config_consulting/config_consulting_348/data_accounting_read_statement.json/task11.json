Look at the \"Retained Earnings\" line item:\n   - Initial amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n   - End amount: 905750.76 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n2. The change in retained earnings over this period is:\n   - 905750.76 - 0.00 = 905750.76\n\n3. Since retained earnings represent the accumulated profit or loss retained in the entity, the change from initial to final value reflects profit earned during this period and retained in the company.\n\n**Therefore:**\n- Initial value of retained earnings = 0.00\n- End value of retained earnings = 905750.76\n\n**Final answer in the specified format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '905750.76'} }\n```",
