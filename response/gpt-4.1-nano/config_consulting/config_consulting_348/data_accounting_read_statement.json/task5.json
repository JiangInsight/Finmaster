The task is to identify assets held for sale, including assets in the process of being manufactured or in production for sale. \n\n2. Looking at the account entries, \"Inventory\" is a common line item associated with assets in production or ready for sale.\n\n3. In this case:\n   - Initial Inventory: 0.00\n   - End Inventory: 112,000.00\n\n4. Since inventory can represent assets in various stages of manufacturing or ready for sale, and the context of \"assets held for sale\" aligns with inventory, the relevant figures are those associated with \"Inventory.\"\n\nTherefore, the initial value and final value of assets held for sale are:\n\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- End value: 112,000.00\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '112000.00'} }\n```",
