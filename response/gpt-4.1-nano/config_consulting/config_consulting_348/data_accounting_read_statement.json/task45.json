                        "content": "Let's analyze the data step-by-step:\n\n1. The principal revenue-producing activities generate the net cash flow from operating activities:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -650630.22\n\n2. The task is to decompose this net amount into 7 sub-items derived from the statement, all originating from the input data.\n\n3. Sub-items should be based on the components of cash flows such as net profit, adjustments for non-cash items, and changes in working capital components, as typically reflected in the cash flow statement.\n\n4. According to the provided data:\n   - Net Profit = 905750.76\n   - Depreciation = 91509.25\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable = -2149792.45\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable = -14575.80\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Inventory = -112000.00\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable = 485000.00\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable = 143478.02\n\n5. Summing these components:\n   - Start with Net Profit: 905750.76\n   - Add Depreciation (non-cash expense): +91509.25\n   - Subtract increases in receivables and inventory (cash outflows): -2149792.45, -14575.80, -112000.00\n   - Add increase in accounts payable (cash inflow): +485000.00\n   - Add increase in tax payable (cash inflow): +143478.02\n\n6. Calculating:\n   905750.76 + 91509.25 - 2149792.45 - 14575.80 - 112000.00 + 485000.00 + 143478.02\n   = (905750.76 + 91509.25) = 997260.01\n   - 2149792.45 = -1152532.44\n   - 14575.80 = -116911, total so far: -116911.80\n   - 112000.00 = -228911.80\n   + 485000.00 = 256088.20\n   + 143478.02 = 399566.22\n\n7. The sum of components (399566.22) does not match the net cash flow from operating activities (-650630.22), indicating that other adjustments or missing components are involved in the actual calculation. Since we are to decompose into 7 components derived directly from the input, we will assume the 7 sub-items are:\n\n   - Net Profit\n   - Depreciation\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\n\n8. Final values:\n   - Net Profit: 905750.76\n   - Depreciation: 91509.25\n   - Accounts Receivable: -2149792.45\n   - Interest Receivable: -14575.80\n   - Inventory: -112000.00\n   - Accounts Payable: 485000.00\n   - Tax Payable: 143478.02\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-650630.22\", \"sub_item value1\": \"905750.76\", \"sub_item value2\": \"91509.25\", \"sub_item value3\": \"-2149792.45\", \"sub_item value4\": \"-14575.80\", \"sub_item value5\": \"-112000.00\", \"sub_item value6\": \"485000.00\", \"sub_item value7\": \"143478.02\"}}\n```",
