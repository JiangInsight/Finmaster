These are typically recorded under accounts such as \"Accounts Receivable.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Look for accounts that indicate amounts owed to the company for sales made on credit.\n2. The relevant account is \"Accounts Receivable.\"\n3. The initial value of \"Accounts Receivable\" is 0.00 at the start date.\n4. The end value of \"Accounts Receivable\" is 2,149,792.45 at the end date.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item of interest is \"Accounts Receivable\" with an initial amount of 0.00 and a final amount of 2,149,792.45.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '2149792.45'} }\n```",
