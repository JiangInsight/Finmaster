The key line item in these statements typically is \"Net Profit,\" which reflects the residual earnings after all expenses.\n\nGiven the provided data for the problem:\n\n- Net Profit = 905750.76\n\nThis value explicitly represents the profit retained after all expenses have been deducted.\n\nThere is no need for further calculations because the Net Profit already provides the desired figure.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'value': '905750.76'} }",
