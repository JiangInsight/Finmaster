Review the current assets listed:\n   - Cash on Hand\n   - Bank Deposits\n   - Interest Receivable\n   - Accounts Receivable\n   - Inventory\n2. Usually, cash, receivables, and inventory are assets intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of operations.\n3. Fixed Assets are non-current and typically not intended for sale in the short term, so they are not included.\n4. The total current assets in the initial and end figures are provided.\n\nCalculations:\n- Initial total current assets: 8,000,000.00\n- End total current assets: 9,625,738.03\n\nWhile the problem asks for specific line items, the example solution only provides the total current assets' initial and final values.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '9625738.03'}}\n```",
