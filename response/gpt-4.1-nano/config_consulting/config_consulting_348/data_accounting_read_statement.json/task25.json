These often include selling expenses, distribution expenses, and any specific costs mentioned explicitly for order acquisition and delivery.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Review the expense accounts listed.\n2. Identify expenses related directly to securing customer orders and delivering goods/services.\n3. Selling Expenses are usually associated with marketing, sales personnel, and distribution costs.\n4. Other expenses like administrative, depreciation, financial expenses, or tax are not directly tied to order securing or delivery.\n\nIn this case:\n- Selling Expenses: 309942.03 (directly related to sales activities)\n- Other costs like Depreciation, Financial Expenses are not directly tied to order acquisition/delivery.\n\nTherefore, the relevant costs are \"Selling Expenses\" of 309942.03.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"solution\": {'value': '309942.03'} }",
