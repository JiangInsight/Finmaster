This corresponds to the accounts affecting accounts receivable (or similar), where a decrease indicates that the entity has received cash from customers for credit sales.\n\nIn the provided data, the relevant line item is:\n- (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\n\nA decrease in accounts receivable means that the entity received cash for credits extended in previous periods.\n\nIn the second statement, the amount listed is:\n- (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable: -2149792.45\n\nAlthough labeled \"Increase\" in the account name, the value is negative, which indicates a decrease in accounts receivable. Therefore, this is the line item of interest.\n\nBased on the task, the required value is:\n- Amount of decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit: **-2149792.45**\n\nNow, let's present this as per the solution format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2149792.45'}}\n```",
