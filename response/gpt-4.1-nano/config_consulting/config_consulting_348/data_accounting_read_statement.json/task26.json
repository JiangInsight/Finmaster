In the provided income statement, the relevant line is \"Financial Expenses.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Review all line items for any mention of financing costs or expenses related to raising funds.\n2. The line \"Financial Expenses\" directly indicates costs associated with financing (such as interest on debt).\n3. The amount listed under \"Financial Expenses\" is 50283.07 on the given date.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and value representing financing costs are:  \n**Financial Expenses: 50283.07**\n\nFinal answer in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '50283.07'} }\n```",
