Locate the line item related to accounts payable changes in the cash flow statement.\n2. The \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is recorded as a positive number when it increases, indicating additional amounts owed for goods/services received on credit during the period.\n3. In the provided data, the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is 485,000.00 as of 2024-02-05. This signifies an increase, meaning the company owes more for credit purchases during that period.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and value of the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit is 485,000.00.\n\nFinal answer in the specified format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"485000.00\"}}\n```",
