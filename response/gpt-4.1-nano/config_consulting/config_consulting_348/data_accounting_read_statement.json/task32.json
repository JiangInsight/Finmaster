                        "content": "Let's analyze the income statement step by step to find the net profit retained after all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization.\n\nStep 1: Identify total revenue\n- Total Revenue: 2,869,560.42\n\nStep 2: Deduct total costs (Cost of Goods Sold + Total Expenses)\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 1,249,000.00\n- Total Expenses: 585,907.44\n\nStep 3: Calculate gross profit:\nGross Profit = Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold\n= 2,869,560.42 - 1,249,000.00 = 1,620,560.42\n\nStep 4: Deduct operating expenses (Administrative Expenses + Selling Expenses + Depreciation + Financial Expenses)\n- Administrative Expenses: 134,173.09\n- Selling Expenses: 309,942.03\n- Depreciation: 91,509.25\n- Financial Expenses: 50,283.07\n\nTotal Operating Expenses (excluding COGS and other expenses): \n= 134,173.09 + 309,942.03 + 91,509.25 + 50,283.07 = 635,907.44\n\nNote: The total expenses listed are 585,907.44, but since we've broken down operating expenses separately, their sum matches.\n\nStep 5: Find profit before tax:\n- Profit Before Tax: 1,049,228.78\n\nStep 6: Deduct tax expense:\n- Tax Expense: 143,478.02\n\nStep 7: Calculate net profit:\nNet Profit = Profit Before Tax - Tax Expense\n= 1,049,228.78 - 143,478.02 = 905,750.76\n\nSo, the net profit retained after all expenses is 905,750.76.\n\nComponent sub-items (from the data):\n1. Total Revenue: 2,869,560.42\n2. Cost of Goods Sold: 1,249,000.00\n3. Total Expenses (including operating expenses and others): 585,907.44\n4. Interest Income (not directly affecting profit reduction, but relevant): 14,575.80\n5. Tax Expense: 143,478.02\n\nNow, let's format the answer as requested.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '905750.76', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '2869560.42', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '1249000.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value3': '585907.44', 'sub_items_sub_item value4': '14575.80', 'sub_items_sub_item value5': '143478.02'}}\n```",
