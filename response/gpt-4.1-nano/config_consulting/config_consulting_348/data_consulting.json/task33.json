                        "content": "Let's carefully calculate each of the required ratios step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n- **Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n- From cash flow statement:  \n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -650,630.22 (outflow)  \n- From balance sheet:  \n  Total Current Liabilities = 628,478.02  \n- **Calculation:**  \n  Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -650,630.22 / 628,478.02 ≈ -1.035\n\n### Step 2: Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n- **Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt  \n- Debt = Total Liabilities (which is Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity minus Equity)  \n- Total Assets at End: 14,534,228.78  \n- Owner's Equity at End: 13,905,750.76  \n- Therefore, Total Debt = Total Assets - Owner's Equity = 14,534,228.78 - 13,905,750.76 ≈ 628,478.02 (which matches total current liabilities, as liabilities mainly comprise current liabilities here)  \n- Using Operating Cash Flow = -650,630.22  \n- **Calculation:**  \n  Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -650,630.22 / 628,478.02 ≈ -1.035\n\n### Step 3: Inventory Turnover Ratio\n- **Formula:** Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  \n- From income statement:  \n  COGS = 1,249,000.00  \n- Inventory at start = 112,000.00 (2024-02-05) end = 112,000.00, so average Inventory = (0 + 112,000) / 2 = 56,000  \n  *Note: Since beginning inventory was zero at start, and the ending is 112,000, approximate average as (0 + 112,000)/2 = 56,000*  \n- **Calculation:**  \n  Inventory Turnover Ratio = 1,249,000 / 56,000 ≈ 22.30\n\n### Step 4: Debt to Equity Ratio\n- **Formula:** Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity  \n- Total Debt = 628,478.02  \n- Shareholders’ Equity = 13,905,750.76  \n- **Calculation:**  \n  Debt to Equity Ratio = 628,478.02 / 13,905,750.76 ≈ 0.0452 (or about 0.045)\n\n### Step 5: Quick Ratio\n- **Formula:** (Cash + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable) / Current Liabilities  \n- Cash and Cash Equivalents:  \n  Cash on Hand = 3,057,369.78  \n  Bank Deposits = 4,292,000.00  \n  Interest Receivable = 14,575.80  \n  Accounts Receivable = 2,149,792.45  \n- **Subtotal:**  \n  Quick Assets = 3,057,369.78 + 4,292,000.00 + 14,575.80 + 2,149,792.45 ≈ 9,513,738.83  \n- Current Liabilities = 628,478.02  \n- **Calculation:**  \n  Quick Ratio = 9,513,738.83 / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.13\n\n### Step 6: Current Ratio\n- **Formula:** Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \n- Total Current Assets = 9,625,738.03  \n- Total Current Liabilities = 628,478.02  \n- **Calculation:**  \n  Current Ratio = 9,625,738.03 / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.32\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer in JSON:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.04\",\n  \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-1.04\",\n  \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"22.30\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.045\",\n  \"Quick Ratio\": \"15.13\",\n  \"Current Ratio\": \"15.32\"\n}}\n```",
