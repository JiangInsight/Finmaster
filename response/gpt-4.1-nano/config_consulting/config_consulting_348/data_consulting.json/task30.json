                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided data step by step to calculate the required financial ratios.\n\n---\n\n**1. Current Ratio**\n\n**Formula:**  \nCurrent Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\n**Data:**  \n- Total Current Assets = 9,625,738.03  \n- Total Current Liabilities = 628,478.02\n\n**Calculation:**  \nCurrent Ratio = 9,625,738.03 / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.32\n\n---\n\n**2. Quick Ratio**\n\n**Formula:**  \nQuick Ratio = (Total Current Assets - Inventory) / Total Current Liabilities\n\n**Data:**  \n- Total Current Assets = 9,625,738.03  \n- Inventory = 112,000.00  \n- Total Current Liabilities = 628,478.02\n\n**Calculation:**  \nQuick Assets = 9,625,738.03 - 112,000 = 9,513,738.03\n\nQuick Ratio = 9,513,738.03 / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.13\n\n---\n\n**3. Debt to Asset Ratio**\n\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\n**Data:**  \n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities + Other liabilities (not explicitly listed, but from balance sheet, Total Liabilities = sum of current liabilities + non-current liabilities).  \n- From balance sheet, total liabilities = 628,478.02 (current) + 0 (not explicitly given for non-current liabilities) → Assuming only current liabilities are listed, total liabilities = 628,478.02.\n\n- Total Assets = 14,534,228.78\n\n**Calculation:**  \nDebt to Asset Ratio = 628,478.02 / 14,534,228.78 ≈ 0.0432 or 4.32%  \nHowever, note the initial data indicates only current liabilities are listed, the total liabilities should include other, but we are given only current liabilities and owner’s equity. Since no other liabilities are explicitly listed, we proceed with this.\n\nAlternatively, considering only current liabilities as debt (which is a conservative approach):\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio ≈ 0.0432\n\n---\n\n**4. Debt to Equity Ratio**\n\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n\n**Data:**  \n- Total Liabilities = 628,478.02  \n- Owner’s Equity = 13,905,750.76\n\n**Calculation:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = 628,478.02 / 13,905,750.76 ≈ 0.0452\n\n---\n\n**5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**\n\n**Definition:**  \nRatio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt\n\n**Data:**  \n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -650,630.22  \n- Total Debt (assumed from current liabilities list) = 628,478.02\n\n**Calculation:**  \nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -650,630.22 / 628,478.02 ≈ -1.035\n\nSince the ratio is negative, it indicates the cash flow from operations is not sufficient to cover debt, and the negative sign indicates cash outflow.\n\n---\n\n**Final answers:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Current Ratio\": \"15.32\",\n  \"Quick Ratio\": \"15.13\",\n  \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.043\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.045\",\n  \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-1.04\"\n}}\n```",
