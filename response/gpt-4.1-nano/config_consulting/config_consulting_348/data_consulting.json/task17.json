                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided data step by step to calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio.\n\n**Step 1: Identify necessary components**\n\n- **Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: Given as Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n- **Total Debt**: Typically, total debt can be approximated as total liabilities. Since explicit debt figures are not directly provided, we can use total liabilities, which consist of current liabilities and any long-term liabilities.  \n  In both examples, total liabilities are not explicitly provided. However, from the balance sheet, we see total current liabilities and total liabilities and owner’s equity together.\n\n- **Total liabilities**: In the provided balance sheet, the \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" are given. To approximate the debt, we can assume total liabilities are:\n\n  Total Liabilities = Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity - Owner's Equity\n\n  Alternatively, since total liabilities are not explicitly broken down, a reasonable assumption is to use \"Total Current Liabilities\" plus any non-current liabilities (not explicitly given).  \n  As non-current liabilities are not provided, we can take total liabilities as the sum of current liabilities and non-current liabilities. If non-current liabilities are not given, and owner’s equity is available, then total liabilities are total assets minus owner’s equity.\n\n- **Calculate total debt as total liabilities**: For the second problem, total liabilities approximate as:\n\n  Total liabilities = Total assets - Owner's Equity\n\n  Using the balance sheet:\n\n  Total assets = 14534228.78  \n  Total owner’s equity = 13905750.76\n\n  Therefore, total liabilities = 14534228.78 - 13905750.76 = 628478.02\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Extract the necessary figures from the new problem**\n\n- **Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: From the cash flow statement: -650630.22\n- **Total Debt**: From the balance sheet: 628,478.02\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{-650,630.22}{628,478.02} \\approx -1.035\n\\]\n\nFor reporting purposes, it's customary to express ratios with two decimal points.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Final answer formatting**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-1.04\"} }\n```\n\n**Note**: The ratio is negative because the cash flow from operating activities is negative, indicating that the company’s operational cash flows are insufficient to cover its debt obligations.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-1.04\"} }\n```",
