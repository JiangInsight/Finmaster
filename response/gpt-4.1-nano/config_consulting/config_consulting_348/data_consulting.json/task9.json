                        "content": "To calculate the Cash to Current Debt Ratio, we need two key figures:\n\n1. Current Cash and Cash Equivalents\n2. Current Debt (which is typically represented by Total Current Liabilities)\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n\n- Cash and Cash Equivalents:\n  - Cash on Hand: 3,057,369.78\n  - Bank Deposits: 4,292,000.00\n  - Interest Receivable: 14,575.80\n  - Accounts Receivable: 2,149,792.45\n  - Inventory: 112,000.00\n\nTotal Cash and Cash Equivalents = 3,057,369.78 + 4,292,000.00 + 14,575.80 + 2,149,792.45 + 112,000.00  \n= 3,057,369.78 + 4,292,000.00 + 14,575.80 + 2,149,792.45 + 112,000.00  \n= 9,625,738.03\n\n- Total Current Liabilities (Current Debt):\n  - Accounts Payable: 485,000.00\n  - Taxes Payable: 143,478.02\n\nTotal Current Liabilities = 485,000.00 + 143,478.02 = 628,478.02\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = Cash and Cash Equivalents / Total Current Liabilities  \n= 9,625,738.03 / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.30\n\nHowever, in the example solution, the ratio is presented as a decimal, approximately 0.23. Since the ratio is typically expressed as a decimal or a ratio, and given the magnitude, it's common to express it as a ratio:\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the ratio is expressed as a decimal to indicate how many times cash covers current liabilities. The calculation yields approximately 15.3, meaning cash exceeds current debt by 15 times.\n\nIf the desired format is a ratio like 0.23 (from the example), it might have been expressed as:\n\nCash / Current Debt = (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / (Total Current Liabilities)\n\nwhich we have as ~15.30, so the ratio is roughly 15.3.\n\nBut in the example given for the solution, the ratio is 0.23, which suggests cash is less than current debt. To match the example pattern, we should express the ratio accordingly.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the data:\n\n**Final Ratio:** approximately **15.30**\n\nBut the template indicates a value like 0.23, which might be an example or a misinterpretation. Usually, ratios above 1 indicate ample cash coverage; ratios below 1 indicate less cash coverage.\n\nSince the user asked for the Cash to Current Debt Ratio, it's more conventional to leave it as:\n\n- Cash and Cash Equivalents / Total Current Liabilities ≈ 15.3\n\nExpressed as a decimal:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"15.30\"}}\n```\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"15.30\"}}\n```",
