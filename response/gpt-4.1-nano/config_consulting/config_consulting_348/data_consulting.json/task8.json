However, the example indicates the answer is presented as a straightforward ratio without percentage signs.\n\nIn the example, the ratio was 4.41, which suggests they are likely presenting the ratio as a multiple, not in percentage terms. Since the example shows a ratio over 1, and our number is less than 1, it might be acceptable to present as a decimal or a ratio.\n\nGiven that, the ratio is approximately **0.72**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"0.72\"}}\n```",
