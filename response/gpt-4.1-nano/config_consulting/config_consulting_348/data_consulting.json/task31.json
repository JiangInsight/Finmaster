                        "content": "Let's calculate each ratio step by step.\n\n**Given Data:**\n\nFrom the latest balance sheet:\n- Accounts Receivable (End Amount): 2,149,792.45\n- Total Current Assets (End): 9,625,738.03\n- Total Assets (End): 14,534,228.78\n- Total Current Liabilities (End): 628,478.02\n- Total Owner's Equity (End): 13,905,750.76\n- Total Liabilities = Total Assets - Equity = 14,534,228.78 - 13,905,750.76 = 628,478.02 (matching Total Current Liabilities; implying possibly no long-term debt)\n\nFrom cash flow:\n- Net Accounts Receivable Decrease: 2,149,792.45\n- Operating Cash Flow (Net): -650,630.22\n\nFrom income statement:\n- Revenue: 2,869,560.42\n- Net Profit: 905,750.76\n\n---\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio = Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nSince we only have end balances, and no data for the prior period, assume the average ≈ end balance for simplicity.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Revenue}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} = \\frac{2,869,560.42}{2,149,792.45} \\approx 1.33\n\\]\n\nBut, typically, the ratio uses an average of opening and closing receivables; here, since opening is zero, we take the end balance.\n\n**However, in the previous example, the answer was 4.47, which is higher.** To be consistent, perhaps the actual turnover considers period-specific revenue and receivables. But given data, this is our best estimate.\n\n**Result:**\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio ≈ 1.33\n\n---\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n= \\frac{-650,630.22}{628,478.02} \\approx -1.04\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis is typically:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nFrom beginning and ending cash balances:\n- Beginning Cash: 8,000,000.00\n- Ending Cash: 7,349,369.78\n\nWe'll use the ending balance for calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7,349,369.78}{628,478.02} \\approx 11.70\n\\]\n\nThis indicates the company's ability to cover current liabilities with cash.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Revenue}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n= \\frac{2,869,560.42}{14,534,228.78} \\approx 0.197\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Owner's Equity}} = \\frac{628,478.02}{13,905,750.76} \\approx 0.045\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final answers formatted:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"1.33\",\n  \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-1.04\",\n  \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.04\",\n  \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.197\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.045\"\n}}\n```\n(Note: I aligned \"operating cash flow ratio\" and \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\" since they are often considered similar; however, if needed, \"operating cash flow ratio\" can be based on cash vs current liabilities, and \"ratio\" may vary slightly depending on definition.)",
