Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n- Operating Cash Flow (from cash flow statement): -650,630.22\n- Current Liabilities: 628,478.02\n- Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities = -650,630.22 / 628,478.02 ≈ -1.036\n\n#### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n- Since total liabilities are total assets minus equity:\n  - Total Assets = 14,534,228.78\n  - Equity = 13,905,750.76\n  - Total liabilities = 14,534,228.78 - 13,905,750.76 ≈ 628,478.02 (which matches total current liabilities, indicating no non-current liabilities are given)\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Shareholders' Equity = 628,478.02 / 13,905,750.76 ≈ 0.045\n\n#### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n- Total Revenue: 2,869,560.42\n- Total Assets (end): 14,534,228.78\n- Ratio = Total Revenue / Total Assets = 2,869,560.42 / 14,534,228.78 ≈ 0.197 (about 0.20)\n\n#### 4. Quick Ratio\n- Quick Assets = Cash + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n  - = 3,057,369.78 + 4,292,000.00 + 14,575.80 + 2,149,792.45 = 9,513,738.03\n- Current Liabilities: 628,478.02\n- Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities = 9,513,738.03 / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.12\n\n#### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n- Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities = same as first ratio: -1.036\n\n#### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n- ROE = Net Profit / Total Owner's Equity = 905,750.76 / 13,905,750.76 ≈ 0.0651, or 6.51%\n\n#### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n- Accounts Receivable: 2,149,792.45\n- Revenue: 2,869,560.42\n- Ratio = Revenue / Accounts Receivable = 2,869,560.42 / 2,149,792.45 ≈ 1.34\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.04\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.045\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.20\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"15.12\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.04\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"6.51%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"1.34\"\n  }\n}\n```",
