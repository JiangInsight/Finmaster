only the change is pertinent.\n\n### Step 6: Final inventory change\n- Overall, there is a decrease in inventory since sales exceeded purchases:\n  \\[\n  \\text{(Decrease)} = 108 \\text{ units}\n  \\]\n\n- The approximate monetary impact (assuming the units are inventory units and valued at purchase prices) can be represented in currency:\n\n  - P001: Units sold exceeded stock â€” net 0 (no inventory remaining)\n  - P002: Remaining units of 3 at an average unit price of 20,000\n  - P003: Remaining units of 29 at 50,000\n  - P004: Remaining units of 36 at 100,000\n\nCalculations (rounded):\n- P001: 0 units\n- P002: 3 units * 20,000 = 60,000\n- P003: 29 units * 50,000 = 1,450,000\n- P004: 36 units * 100,000 = 3,600,000\n\nTotal closing inventory value: approximately\n\\[\n60,000 + 1,450,000 + 3,600,000 = 5,110,000\n\\]\n\nInitial inventory value:\n- P001: 3 units * 10,000 = 30,000\n- P002: 46 units * 20,000 = 920,000\n- P003: 53 units * 50,000 = 2,650,000\n- P004: 36 units * 100,000 = 3,600,000\n\nTotal initial value: \n\\[\n30,000 + 920,000 + 2,650,000 + 3,600,000 = 7,200,000\n\\]\n\nChange:\n\\[\n7,200,000 - 5,110,000 = 2,090,000 \\text{ decrease}\n\\]\n\nBut considering the simplified approach aligning with typical inventory impact, the net reduction based on units:\n\n**Final inventory: approximately: -$5,090,000**\n\n### **Answer:**\n\nThe negative indicates a reduction; the earlier simplified calculation suggests a decrease of about **$5,090,000**.\n\n### Final output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-5090000.00\"}}\n```",
