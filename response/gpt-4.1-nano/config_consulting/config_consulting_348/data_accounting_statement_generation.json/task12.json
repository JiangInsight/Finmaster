But the example suggests initial is zero; perhaps comprehensive calculation suggests starting at zero, and unpaid amounts accumulate during the period.\n\nBased on the provided details and aligning with example, the initial is 0, and the end balance just the sum of unpaid purchase amounts.\n\n**Final step:**\n\n**Initial Accounts Payable:** 0.00  \n**Final Accounts Payable:** 1,590,000.00\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accounts Payable End Value': '1590000.00'}}\n```",
