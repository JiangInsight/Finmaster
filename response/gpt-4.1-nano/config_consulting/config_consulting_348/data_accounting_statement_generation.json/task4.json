The initial balances listed are cash, bank deposit, and fixed assets, which do not affect receivables.\n- The first transactions with Accounts Receivable are from Sale20240103006 and Sale20240103006, both unpaid, totaling:\n\n  - Sale20240103006: 31456.16\n  - Sale20240103005: 33587.28\n\n- Before these, no previous receivables are recorded. So, initial accounts receivable are zero.\n\n**Step 2: Sum of receivables at the beginning**\n\n- Given the first listed receivables are unpaid sales, the initial accounts receivable balance is **0.00**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Identify all unpaid receivable transactions and their amounts**\n\nThe unpaid receivables after initial are:\n\n- From the entire list, unpaid (or \"Unpaid\") sales and interest receivables are accumulated.\n\nSumming all \"Unpaid\" after the initial date:\n\n1.
