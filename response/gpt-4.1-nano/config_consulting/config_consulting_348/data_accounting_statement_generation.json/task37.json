However, considering the second dataset's figure of 45756.35 on 2024-01-01 and the subsequent figure of 45752.90 on 2024-02-01, the latest depreciation expense recorded is 45752.90.\n\nThe standard approach is to take the depreciation expense incurred during the period, which is 45752.90 in the second dataset.\n\n**Final step:** The depreciation amount in the cash flow statement is 45752.90.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Depreciation\": \"45752.90\"}}\n```",
