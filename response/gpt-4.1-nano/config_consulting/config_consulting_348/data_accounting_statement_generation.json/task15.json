The initial assets include cash deposits, bank deposits, and fixed assets, but liabilities are zero.\n\nInitial liabilities:\n- **Total Liabilities Initial Value** = 0.00\n\n**Step 2: Identify liabilities in the end data set**\n\nLiabilities primarily come from:\n- Accounts payable (unpaid purchases)\n- Unpaid interest receivables and accrued expenses\n- Any other unpaid obligations\n\nLet's go through the data and sum the unpaid or payable amounts.\n\n---\n\n### End data analysis:\n\n- **Accounts Payable (Purchases unpaid):**\n  -
