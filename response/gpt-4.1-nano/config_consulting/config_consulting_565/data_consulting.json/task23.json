From the balance sheet:\n  - Total Current Liabilities = 499,821.72\n  - Total Non-current Liabilities are not explicitly given, but since total liabilities equal total assets minus owner's equity:\n    - Total Assets = 14,890,758.71\n    - Owner's Equity = 14,390,936.99\n    - Total Liabilities = Total Assets - Owner's Equity = 14,890,758.71 - 14,390,936.99 = 499,821.72 (which matches total current liabilities, so no additional non-current liabilities are specified)\n  \n- Total liabilities (Liabilities) = 499,821.72\n\n- Cash flow from operating activities (net cash flow) = -1,182,491.05\n\n- Debt at the end (Total liabilities) = 499,821.72\n- Net debt (assuming debt is represented by total liabilities, as no other debt info is provided)\n\nNow, compute the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nPlugging values:\n\\[ \\frac{-1,182,491.05}{499,821.72} \\approx -2.366 \\]\n\nExpressed as a ratio: approximately -2.37\n\n### Final answers in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Gross Profit Margin\": \"57.48%\", \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-2.37\"}}\n```",
