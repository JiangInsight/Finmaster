                        "content": "To calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio, we need two key figures:\n\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** – which is available in the income statement.\n2. **Average Inventory** – which can be calculated from the balance sheet data.\n\n### Step 1: Extract the COGS\nFrom the latest income statement:\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** 1,684,000.00\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Average Inventory\n- **Beginning Inventory:** 0.00 (since initial inventory is zero at the start of the period)\n- **Ending Inventory:** 0.00 (as per the end balance)\n\nGiven this, the **average inventory**:\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2} = \\frac{0 + 0}{2} = 0\n\\]\n\nHowever, to have a meaningful inventory turnover ratio, if the inventory at the end is zero, the ratio will be undefined or tend to infinity. But since the initial inventory is zero and ending inventory is zero, the implication is that inventory turnover calculation isn't meaningful here due to zero inventory.\n\n**But**, considering the context and typical calculation, since the starting inventory was zero and ending inventory is also zero, the ratio would mathematically approach infinity (or be undefined). \n\n**In practice**, if inventory is zero at both ends, the ratio could be considered as the maximum possible, indicating super-high inventory turnover. For purposes of this calculation, if the inventory turns over more than once, it would be conceptually infinite, but since no inventory exists, we might report as a very high number or \"not applicable.\"\n\n**Alternatively**, some calculations ignore the zero inventory case and produce a ratio based on non-zero values if available.\n\n### Final step:\nGiven the data, the best way is to recognize the inventory turns over at a very high rate—ideally, the ratio tends toward infinity. But in specific financial ratios, if inventory is zero, practically, the ratio could be considered as very high.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Since average inventory is zero, the Inventory Turnover Ratio is undefined or tends toward infinity.\n\n**For expression purposes,** I'll set the ratio as a very high value, e.g., \"Infinity\" or a very large number.\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"Infinity\"}}\n```",
