However, here, the value is not provided explicitly; instead, we are given \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities,\" which likely refers to the cash flow from operating activities. The main difference is that \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" may include adjustments, but based on the typical cash flow statement format, it appears to be the same as the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities.\"\n\nGiven that, the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" is likely **-1,182,491.05** based on the last data point.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nThe formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-1,182,491.05}{1,390,936.99} \\approx -0.8505\n\\]\n\nExpressed as a ratio or percentage. Usually, this ratio is presented as a positive number to indicate the magnitude, but since the cash flow is negative, the ratio will be negative.\n\n### Step 4: Format to required decimal point or fraction\n\nTo match the example, the ratio seems rounded to two decimal places:\n\n\\[\n-0.85\n\\]\n\nor, if expressing in percentage:\n\n\\[\n-85\\%\n\\]\n\nBut since the example's ratio is `4.41` (positive), we should keep the raw ratio with a negative sign for accuracy, as it indicates negative operating cash flow relative to net income.\n\n### Final step: Prepare the answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-0.85\"}}\n```\n\n**Note:** If the expected output prefers a positive ratio, ignore the sign, but typically, the sign indicates the direction (positive or negative relationship). For clarity, and matching typical practice, I will include the sign.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-0.85\"}}\n```",
