Since the ratios are quite low for debt ratio and negative for cash flow ratio, we'll round and present in a consistent format.\n\n**However, the previous example solution had Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.14 and Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: 4.41, which seems inconsistent with typical cash flow ratios (likely they took absolute value or used different rounding).**\n\nGiven the negative cash flow and small debt ratio, let's follow the example style and provide the ratios accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.03\", \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-0.85\"}}\n```",
