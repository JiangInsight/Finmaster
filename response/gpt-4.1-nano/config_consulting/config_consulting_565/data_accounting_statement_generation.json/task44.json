Search for transactions indicating purchase or acquisition of fixed assets.\n2. There are several relevant entries, but the most direct one is:  \n   - \"Fixed Asset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase\" with amount: 305,354.43.\n3. Check if there are any other transactions involving fixed assets.  \n   - Not explicitly present; most other fixed assets are marked as \"Initial\" or just recorded as assets, but since the task is to find the final purchase of fixed assets, the transaction labeled \"Fixed Asset20231231001\" is the key indicator.\n4. The amount of purchase of fixed assets is 305,354.43.\n\nTherefore, the total purchase of fixed assets in these transactions is **305,354.43**.\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '305354.43'} }\n```",
