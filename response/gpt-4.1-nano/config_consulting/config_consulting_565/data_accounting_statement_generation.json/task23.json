summing these values:\n\nTotal sum â‰ˆ 4,410,000 (approximately, after adding all precise values).\n\nStep 4: Finalize the total.\n\nThe total cost of goods sold (COGS) is approximately 4,410,000.\n\nSince the problem statement suggests a precise figure, based on the sum of the detailed costs, the total approximates to 4,410,000 or a close value.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n{\"solution\":
