                        "content": "Let's analyze the transactions to identify changes in non-current assets from initial to final.\n\n**Step 1: Identify initial non-current assets**\n- Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets = 5,000,000.00\n\n**Step 2: Look for transactions involving non-current assets purchase, sale, or disposal after initial date**\n\n**Purchases of non-current assets:**\n- \"FixedAsset20231231001\" | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 305,354.43\n\n**Additional fixed asset purchases (if any):**\n- \"Fixed Asset\" purchase on 2023-12-31: 305,354.43\n- \"Purchase\" on 2023-12-31: 1,500,000.00 (likely a long-term asset)\n- Additional purchase on 2023-12-31: 1,100,000.00 (implied from \"Purchase\" transactions, but mainly the largest one was captured initially; the more detailed ones are not explicitly designated as fixed assets, so for clarity, assume the main fixed assets sum includes only the truly specified fixed assets)\n\n**Sale or disposal:**\n- No sell or disposal of fixed assets recorded explicitly.\n\n**Additional purchase of fixed assets:**\n- \"Fixed Asset\" on 2023-12-31: 305,354.43 (already included)\n- Other significant fixed asset transactions: \n  - 2023-12-31: 1,500,000.00\n  - 2023-12-31: 1,100,000.00\n  - 2023-12-31: 1150000.00 (another fixed asset purchase)\n\n**Step 3: Sum initial and subsequent fixed assets**\n- Initial fixed assets: 5,000,000.00\n- Purchase of fixed assets during period:\n  - 305,354.43\n  - 1,500,000.00\n  - 1,100,000.00\n  - 305,354.43 (same as above, so total of fixed asset purchases after initial: 305,354.43 + 1,500,000.00 + 1,100,000.00 + 305,354.43 = 3,210,708.86)\n\n**Total non-current assets initial value:**\n- 5,000,000.00 (initial) â€” (since no disposals are recorded, initial is straightforward)\n\n**Total non-current assets end value:**\n- Sum of initial + total purchases:\n  5,000,000.00 + 3,210,708.86 = 8,210,708.86\n\n**Step 4: Sum the final amounts of fixed assets (from latest transactions):**\n- The last large fixed asset purchase amount labeled as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" on 2023-12-31: 305,354.43 (already included)\n- Additional fixed asset investments noted in later transactions:\n  - 2023-12-31: 1,500,000.00\n  - 2023-12-31: 1,100,000.00\n  - 2023-12-31: 1150000.00\n- Final recorded fixed asset amount: 305,354.43 (latest) + any other fixed asset purchases or values recorded at later dates, but current transactions mainly reflect purchases, not disposals or revaluations.\n\n**Correcting the sum based on explicit asset purchases and the latest fixed assets:**\n- Sum of all fixed asset purchases recorded:\n  - 305,354.43 + 1,500,000.00 + 1,100,000.00 + 1,150,000.00 = 4,055,354.43\n\n- Initial fixed assets: 5,000,000.00\n\n- No sales of fixed assets are indicated, so final amount:\n  - 5,000,000 + total of purchases = 5,000,000 + 4,055,354.43 = 9,055,354.43\n\nBut there's a discrepancy; earlier, I summed the purchases cumulatively. To clarify, assume the initial fixed assets taken at 5 million, then subsequent investments add to it.\n\n**Final approximate fixed assets:**\n- Initial fixed assets: 5,000,000\n- Additions:\n  - 305,354.43 (on 2023-12-31, possibly a new fixed asset)\n  - 1,500,000.00\n  - 1,100,000.00\n  - 1,150,000.00\n- Total additions: 305,354.43 + 1,500,000 + 1,100,000 + 1,150,000 = 4,055,354.43\n\n**Total fixed assets at the end:**\n- 5,000,000 + 4,055,354.43 = 9,055,354.43\n\nSimilarly, considering the recorded fixed asset purchase at the latest date (from \"FixedAsset20231231001\" with 305,354.43), and the cumulative total fixed assets, the most accurate approach is to sum total of all fixed asset purchases.\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\n\n- **Initial non-current assets**: 5,000,000.00\n- **Final non-current assets**: sum of initial + all fixed asset purchases:\n  \n  **Initial**: 5,000,000.00  \n  **Additional fixed assets purchased**: 305,354.43 + 1,500,000 + 1,100,000 + 1,150,000 = 4,055,354.43\n\n**Total at end**: 5,000,000 + 4,055,354.43 = 9,055,354.43\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '9055354.43'} }\n```",
