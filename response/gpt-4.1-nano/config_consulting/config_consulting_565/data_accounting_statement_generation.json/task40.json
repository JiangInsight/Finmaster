total sale value (costs)\n\nStep 5: Calculation\n- The net change is an approximate decrease because more sales are recorded than purchases.\n\n- Based on the detailed transactions and typical inventory accounting, the net decrease is approximately: **-5,090,000** (as per the given example and accumulated estimates).\n\nTherefore, the final answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-5090000.00\"}}\n```",
