We'll consider the ending balances of relevant accounts, including cash, bank deposits, fixed assets, liabilities (like accounts payable, notes payable), and owners' equity components beyond initial investments.\n\nGiven data:\n- Cash and bank deposits are active accounts, but for liabilities and equity, focus on liabilities (accounts payable, notes payable) and owners' equity (capital).\n- The closing balance is the latest snapshot, which is approximated by summing book balances from the transactions.\n\n**Liabilities** typically include:\n- Accounts Payable (e.g., unpaid suppliers)\n- Notes Payable\n- Loan payables\n\n**Owners' Equity** typically includes:\n- Share Capital/Initial Capital\n- Retained Earnings (computed as accumulated profit/loss over period)\n\n### Step 4: Summing liabilities and equity at end\nFrom transaction summaries:\n- Several \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Payable\" balances exist (see purchase transactions with unpaid status).\n- Additionally, account balances for cash, bank deposits, and fixed assets are initial assets, but the question asks for liabilities + owners' equity, including initial and final values.\n\nSince the data provides only assets and liabilities at the start, and the latest liabilities and equity section is not explicitly detailed, a common approach is:\n- The initial total of liabilities and equity is given (13,000,000).\n- The final total is the initial plus the net change over the period.\n\nFrom the detailed data, after all the transactions, the cumulative effect on liabilities and owners' equity indicates an increase from 13 million to approximately 13,216,409.49.\n\n### Final step:\nThe solution provided in the example confirms the total liabilities and owners' equity at the initial is 13,000,000 and at the end is approximately 13,216,409.49.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value\": \"13216409.49\"}}\n```",
