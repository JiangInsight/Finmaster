The other expenses (Administrative, Depreciation, Financial Expenses) are not directly tied to these activities.\n\nTherefore, the costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods/services are indicated by the \"Selling Expenses\" amount.\n\nAnswer:\n{\"solution\": {'value': '360961.15'} }",
