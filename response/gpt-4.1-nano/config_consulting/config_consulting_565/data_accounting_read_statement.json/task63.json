From the Balance Sheet:**\nWe need the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from the entity's principal revenue-producing activities that are not investing or financing activities — this closely corresponds to the cash generated from operating activities.\n\nWhile the balance sheet shows the ending cash and cash equivalents, it does not directly provide cash flow from operating activities. However, we can note the **cash and cash equivalents** at the end of the period, as it relates to net cash flow from operating activities, and the change in cash can be linked to cash flow from operating activities.\n\n**2. From the Income Statement:**\nWe need total income arising in ordinary activities, which corresponds to total revenue.\n\n**3. From the Cash Flow Statement:**\nWe need the amounts of taxes accrued but not yet paid, which is the \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable.\"\n\nWe also need the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from the principal revenue-producing activities — this is represented more precisely by the **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**, which is directly presented in the cash flow statement.\n\n---\n\n### Extracted items:\n\n- **Value 1:** Taxes accrued but not yet paid — \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" from cash flow statement: **197821.72**\n  \n- **Value 2:** Total income arising in the course of an entity's ordinary activities — \"Total Revenue\" from income statement: **3956433.90**\n\n- **Value 3:** Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from the principal revenue-producing activities — \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": **-1182491.05**\n\n---\n\n### Final answer in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '197821.72', 'value2': '3956433.90', 'value3': '-1182491.05'}}\n```",
