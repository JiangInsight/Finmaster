In the provided data, the relevant account is \"Interest Receivable,\" which increases from 0.00 to 15414.09.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The account \"Interest Receivable\" is specifically associated with interest that has been earned but not yet received.\n2. The initial amount of \"Interest Receivable\" is 0.00, indicating no accrued interest at the start.\n3. The end amount of \"Interest Receivable\" is 15414.09, representing interest accrued during the period but not yet received.\n4. The initial and final values are:\n\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- Final value: 15414.09\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and values are as follows.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '15414.09'} }\n```",
