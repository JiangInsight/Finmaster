The problem specifies assets \"expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle.\"\n2. Typically, this includes current assets such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and other short-term assets.\n3. Non-current assets (like fixed assets) are generally not meant for sale within the operating cycle, unless indicated otherwise.\n4. From the provided data, the relevant line items are:\n    - Cash on Hand\n    - Bank Deposits\n    - Interest Receivable\n    - Accounts Receivable\n    - Inventory (although in the second report, inventory is zero, but it is included in the examples as a current asset)\n5. The initial and end values for total current assets are given:\n    - Initial total current assets: 8,000,000.00\n    - End total current assets: 9,982,261.98\n\nNow, extracting the total current assets values at initial and end points:\n\n**Initial value**: 8,000,000.00  \n**End value**: 9,982,261.98\n\nThis matches the example format, focusing on total current assets.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '9982261.98'} }\n```",
