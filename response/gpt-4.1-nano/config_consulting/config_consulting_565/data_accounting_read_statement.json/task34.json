Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities.\n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole.\n\n**Step 1: Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**\n\nTypically, this would correspond to the main revenue figure, which reflects the income from the core operating activities.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Main Business Revenue: 3956433.90\n- Total Revenue: 3956433.90\n\nUsually, \"Total Revenue\" encompasses the income in the ordinary course of business, so the value of total income is **3956433.90**.\n\n**Step 2: Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**\n\nThis is generally represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\nFrom the table:\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 1684000.00\n\n**Step 3: Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**\n\nThis refers to administrative expenses.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Administrative Expenses: 165230.64\n\n**Step 4: Presenting in original order**\n\nThe issue states to maintain the order as shown in the input:\n- First item: total income (from ordinary activities) — Total Revenue\n- Second item: inventory sold (COGS)\n- Third item: administrative costs\n\nThus, the solutions are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3956433.90', 'value2': '1684000.00', 'value3': '165230.64'}}\n```",
