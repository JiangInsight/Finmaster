Review all line items:\n   - Main Business Revenue: 3956433.90\n   - Total Revenue: 3956433.90\n   - Cost of Goods Sold: 1684000.00\n   - Total Cost: 1684000.00\n   - Gross Profit: 2272433.90\n   - Administrative Expenses, Selling Expenses, Depreciation, Financial Expenses,などは経営活動のコア収益には含まれません。\n   \n2. The \"Main Business Revenue\" is directly associated with the core operating activities.\n\n3. Other items such as \"Interest Income\" or expenses are typically finance-related and not part of core operating income.\n\nBased on this, the core operating income (or the income arising in core operating activities) in this context can be identified as \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n\n**Answer: 3956433.90**\n\nNow, I will present this in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"3956433.90\"}}\n```",
