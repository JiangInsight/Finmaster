                        "content": "To identify the costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services, we need to examine the relevant expenses in the income statement, which typically include selling expenses, administrative expenses, and other related costs linked to the sales process and delivery.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Look at the income statement's line items:\n   - Selling Expenses\n   - Administrative Expenses\n   - Other possible costs related to delivery and securing orders\n\n2. From the provided data, the relevant expenses are:\n   - Selling Expenses: costs associated with marketing, sales commissions, distribution, etc.\n   - Administrative Expenses: costs related to order processing, customer service, and overall administration\n\n3. The sum of these costs can represent the total costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services.\n\n4. For each problem:\n   - First problem: Selling Expenses = 493,854.67; Administrative Expenses = 1,425,164.20\n   - Second problem: Selling Expenses = 360,961.15; Administrative Expenses = 165,230.64\n\n5. It's common to combine both selling and administrative expenses as they both relate to the process of securing and delivering orders.\n\nCalculations:\n\n- First problem:\n  493,854.67 + 1,425,164.20 = 1,919,018.87\n\n- Second problem:\n  360,961.15 + 165,230.64 = 526,191.79\n\nBut since the task is to extract the specific line item and value, and the examples suggest focusing on a single line item rather than a sum, the example given chose \"Selling Expenses\" as the key cost.\n\nGiven the example solution selected the \"Selling Expenses\" line item value, I will follow the same pattern and select \"Selling Expenses\" as the relevant cost.\n\nThus, for the first problem, the specific line item is \"Selling Expenses\" with the value 493,854.67  \nFor the second problem, the specific line item is \"Selling Expenses\" with the value 360,961.15\n\nBut per instructions, I should present only the answer for the second problem, which is:\n\n{\"solution\": {'value': '360961.15'}}\n\nHowever, since the user only wants the final answer, I will provide only that.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"360961.15\"}}\n```",
