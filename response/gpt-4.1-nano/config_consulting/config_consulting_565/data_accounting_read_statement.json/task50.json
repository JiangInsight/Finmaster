                        "content": "Let's proceed by analyzing each of the four specified line items in the context of the provided cash flow statement.\n\n1. The first item refers to the \"systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life\" â€” this is the depreciation expense, which is explicitly listed as \"Depreciation\" with a value of 91503.27.\n\n2. The second item pertains to the \"reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business\" or related inventory changes. Here, \"Increase (Decrease) in Inventory\" is a key indicator. The value shown is -0.00, which essentially indicates no change in inventory during the period.\n\n3. The third item involves the \"net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities related to the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments.\" This corresponds to the cash flows from investing activities. The relevant line is \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" which is -0.00.\n\n4. The fourth item is the \"net increase in cash and cash equivalents during the period,\" which is provided directly as \"Net Increase\" with a value of -1182491.05.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n- Identify depreciation expense: 91503.27.\n- Identify change in assets held for sale/inventory: -0.00.\n- Find cash flow from investing activities: -0.00.\n- Find net increase in cash and cash equivalents: -1182491.05.\n\nNow, we present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91503.27', 'value2': '-0.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '-1182491.05'} }\n```",
