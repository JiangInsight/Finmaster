This account represents liabilities owed to suppliers for goods or services received but not yet paid.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The relevant line item is \"Accounts Payable.\"\n2. In the balance sheet, the initial amount for \"Accounts Payable\" on 2023-12-31 was 0.00.\n3. At the end date, 2024-02-05, \"Accounts Payable\" increased to 302,000.00.\n4. The difference, or the addition in owed amount, is 302,000.00 - 0.00 = 302,000.00.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and the amount of the addition to the owed amount are as follows:\n- Line item: Accounts Payable\n- Addition: 302,000.00\n\nFinal formatted answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '302000.00'} }\n```",
