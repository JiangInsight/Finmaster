                        "content": "To find the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the beginning and ending inventory amounts.\n2. Recognize the inventory cost of goods sold (COGS) reported in the income statement.\n3. The inventory sold during the period is calculated as:\n   \n   Inventory Sold = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory\n\n4. In this case:\n\n   - The beginning inventory for this period is 0.00 (as per the balance sheet data at the start).\n   - The ending inventory at the end of the period is 0.00 (as per the balance sheet data at the end).\n   - The COGS from the income statement is 1,684,000.00.\n\n5. Since beginning and ending inventories are both zero, the entire COGS of 1,684,000.00 must come from inventory that was available for sale during the period, implying the inventories sold amount is 1,684,000.00.\n\n6. Therefore, the carrying amount of inventories sold is the COGS amount.\n\nAnswer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"1684000.00\"}}\n```",
