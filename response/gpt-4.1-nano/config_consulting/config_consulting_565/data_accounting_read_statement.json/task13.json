In the given data, the relevant line items are:\n\n- Fixed Assets (including initial and end values)\n- Accumulated Depreciation (though depreciation reduces asset value, it is a contra-asset account and not directly an asset for realization)\n\nSince the \"Total Non-current Assets\" represent assets that are held long-term or are not intended for sale in the ordinary course, these are what we are interested in.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n1. Look at the \"Fixed Assets\" line: initial and end values.\n2. Confirm that \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is a contra-asset and does not count as an asset for sale or realization.\n3. The problem asks for the total line items and their values, but specifically those assets not expected to be realized or for sale.\n4. The total non-current assets are aggregated in \"Total Non-current Assets,\" which in this case includes the net book value after depreciation.\n5. Extract the initial and end values for \"Total Non-current Assets.\"\n\nFrom the data:\n- Initial value of Total Non-current Assets = 5,000,000.00\n- End value of Total Non-current Assets = 4,908,496.73\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"5000000.00\", \"end value\": \"4908496.73\"}}\n```",
