Identify the line items related to amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit (Accounts Receivable).\n2. Identify the line items related to amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit (Accounts Payable).\n3. For each, extract the initial and final values.\n\nIn the provided table:\n\n- \"Accounts Receivable\" represents amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit.\n- \"Accounts Payable\" represents amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit.\n\nInitial and final values:\n\n- Accounts Receivable:\n  - Initial: 0.00\n  - End: 3,149,338.94\n\n- Accounts Payable:\n  - Initial: 0.00\n  - End: 302,000.00\n\nNow, format these findings into the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value1\": \"0.00\", \"end valu1\": \"3149338.94\", \"initial value2\": \"0.00\", \"end valu2\": \"302000.00\"}}\n```",
