According to the data provided:\n\nProfit Before Tax = 1588758.71\n\nNext, extract the relevant components involved in the calculation of this profit before tax. Typically, profit before tax is derived from:\n\n- Total Revenue (or Main Business Revenue)\n- Total Expenses (including Cost of Goods Sold, Administrative Expenses, Selling Expenses, Depreciation, Financial Expenses, etc.)\n- Financial Income (Interest Income, etc.) which can influence profit.\n\nIn this context, the key components are:\n\n- Total Revenue (or Main Business Revenue)\n- Total Expenses\n- Financial Income (Interest Income)\n\nNow, list their initial and final values:\n\n- Total Revenue: 3956433.90\n- Total Expenses: 699089.28\n- Interest Income: 15414.09\n\nThe goal is to decompose profit before tax into four sub-items, which are the main components contributing to its calculation. Based on typical income statement structure, these sub-items are:\n\n1. Revenue\n2. Cost of Goods Sold (or Total Cost)\n3. Operating Expenses (including Administrative, Selling, Depreciation)\n4. Financial Income (Interest Income)\n\nBut the problem asks to decompose the profit into 4 components originating from the input, and their initial and final values should be provided.\n\nGiven the typical calculation:\n\nProfit Before Tax = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold - Operating Expenses + Financial Income\n\nIn specific, the four sub-items (with their initial and final values) are:\n\n- Revenue: 3956433.90\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 1684000.00\n- Operating Expenses (Total Expenses): 699089.28\n- Interest Income: 15414.09\n\nNow, present the data in the required JSON format.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"1588758.71\", \"sub_item value1\": \"3956433.90\", \"sub_item value2\": \"1684000.00\", \"sub_item value3\": \"699089.28\", \"sub_item value4\": \"15414.09\"}}\n```",
