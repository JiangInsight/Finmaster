                        "content": "First, I need to identify each of the three specific line items:\n\n1. The end value of profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense (Profit Before Tax).\n\n2. The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period: this is typically the increase in Accounts Payable (or similar current liabilities), which represents credit purchases.\n\n3. The capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares: this is \"Paid-in Capital.\"\n\nNext, I will examine each statement group carefully, maintaining the original order:\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n\n- There are no direct line items explicitly referring to profit before tax before tax expense; however, Profit Before Tax appears on the income statement, not the balance sheet.\n\n- The relevant account for increase in credit owed is Accounts Payable. The change is from 0.00 to 302,000.00.\n\n- Shareholders' capital is \"Paid-in Capital,\" which remains at 13,000,000.00.\n\n**Income Statement:**\n\n- Profit Before Tax is listed as 1,588,758.71 (2024-02-05).\n\n- Tax Expense is 197,821.72, but the problem asks for the profit or loss before deducting tax expense, which is Profit Before Tax.\n\n**Cash Flow Statement:**\n\n- The cash flow from operating activities involves net profit, adjustments, etc., but the line items are not directly what we're asked for, so it's less relevant here.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Profit or loss before tax: 1,588,758.71\n\n- Addition in the amount owed for goods/services received on credit: change in Accounts Payable: from 0.00 to 302,000.00 (so, 302,000.00)\n\n- Capital contributed by shareholders: Paid-in Capital: 13,000,000.00\n\nNow, I will prepare the JSON output accordingly, maintaining the order:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1588758.71', 'value2': '302000.00', 'value3': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
