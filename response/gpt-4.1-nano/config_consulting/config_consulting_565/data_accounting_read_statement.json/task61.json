                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided financial statements to identify the two specific line items and their values.\n\n**Step 1: Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**\n\n- These costs typically appear under selling expenses or administrative expenses related to sales and delivery.  \n- Specifically, costs to secure customer orders are often classified as \"Selling Expenses\" or \"Sales and Marketing Expenses.\"\n- Costs to deliver goods and services are usually included under \"Cost of Goods Sold\" or relevant selling expenses.\n\nReviewing the income statements:\n\n- In the first income statement (from the first problem):  \n  - Selling Expenses = 493,854.67  \n  - Administrative Expenses = 1,425,164.20  \n  - Cost of Goods Sold = 4,410,000.00\n\nIn the second income statement (from the second problem):  \n  - Selling Expenses = 360,961.15  \n  - Administrative Expenses = 165,230.64  \n  - Cost of Goods Sold = 1,684,000.00\n\nThe task specifically asks for \"costs incurred to secure customer orders\" and \"to deliver the goods and services.\" Typically, this is captured under \"Selling Expenses\" as these relate directly to sales activities, such as sales commissions, advertising, and transportation costs associated with delivering goods.\n\n**Best fit**:  \n- Costs to secure customer orders: **Selling Expenses**  \n- Costs to deliver goods and services: **Cost of Goods Sold**\n\n**Step 2: Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets**\n\n- These are cash outflows for capital expenditures, generally listed under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the cash flow statements.\n\nFrom the first cash flow statement:  \n  - Purchase of Fixed Assets = 305,354.43\n\nFrom the second cash flow statement:  \n  - Purchase of Fixed Assets = 0.00\n\nThe actual cash paid depends on the cash flow statement, as it shows the cash effect.  \n- For the first problem, the cash payment was 305,354.43.  \n- For the second, it was 0.\n\n**Step 3: Final answer**\n\nThe task probably expects one pair of values representing these two line items from the provided data sets.\n\nBased on the example provided, the output includes the value for:\n\n1. Costs to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services: **Selling Expenses** (or Cost of Goods Sold) â€” the example chooses the specific costs related to sales process, which in most cases is \"Selling Expenses.\"\n\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets: **Purchase of Fixed Assets**\n\nSince the example solution uses \"493854.67\" and \"305354.43\", corresponding to \"Selling Expenses\" and \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" I will follow the same pattern.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"493854.67\", \"value2\": \"305354.43\"}}\n```",
