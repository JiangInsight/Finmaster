                        "content": "Let's analyze the data step-by-step to compute each ratio:\n\n**1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio**\n\n- Formula: Operating Cash Flow / Total Current Liabilities\n- From cash flow statement: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,028,375.55\n- From balance sheet: Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51\n\nCalculation:\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 ≈ -2.72\n\n**2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**\n\n- Usually: Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n- Here, \"Total Debt\" = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable\n- From balance sheet:\n  - Accounts Payable = 247,000\n  - Taxes Payable = 131,850.51\n- Total Debt = 247,000 + 131,850.51 = 378,850.51\n\nCalculation:\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 ≈ -2.72\n\n**3. Inventory Turnover Ratio**\n\n- Formula: Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 1,015,000.00 (from income statement)\n- Inventory:\n  - Initial = 0\n  - End = 203,000.00\n- Average Inventory = (0 + 203,000) / 2 = 101,500\n\nCalculation:\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = 1,015,000 / 101,500 ≈ 10.00\n\n**4. Debt to Equity Ratio**\n\n- Formula: Total Debt / Total Owner's Equity\n- Total Debt: as above, 378,850.51\n- Owner's Equity:\n  - Initial = 13,000,000\n  - End = 13,835,266.51\n- Average Equity = (13,000,000 + 13,835,266.51) / 2 ≈ 13,417,633.25\n\n- For simplicity, we can take the end equity:\n  - Total Owner's Equity = 13,835,266.51\n\nCalculation:\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = 378,850.51 / 13,835,266.51 ≈ 0.0274\n\n**5. Quick Ratio**\n\n- Formula: (Cash + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n- Cash + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable:\n  - Cash: 2,602,624.45 + 4,885,110.81 (bank deposits) (Total cash equivalents?)\n  - But typically, \"Cash\" includes cash on hand + bank deposits:\n    - Cash on Hand: 2,602,624.45\n    - Bank Deposits: 4,283,110.81\n  - Interest Receivable: 15,023.59\n  - Accounts Receivable: 2,117,339.65\n\nSum:\n- Cash & cash equivalents = 2,602,624.45 + 4,283,110.81 = 6,885,735.26\n- Quick Assets = 6,885,735.26 + 15,023.59 + 2,117,339.65 = 9,018,098.50\n\n- Current Liabilities = 378,850.51\n\nCalculation:\n- Quick Ratio = 9,018,098.50 / 378,850.51 ≈ 23.81\n\n**6. Current Ratio**\n\n- Formula: Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n- Total Current Assets = 9,221,098.50\n- Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51\n\nCalculation:\n- Current Ratio = 9,221,098.50 / 378,850.51 ≈ 24.33\n\n---\n\n### Final answers:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-2.72\",\n  \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-2.72\",\n  \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"10.00\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.027\",\n  \"Quick Ratio\": \"23.81\",\n  \"Current Ratio\": \"24.33\"\n}}\n```\n\n**Note:** Ratios are rounded to two decimal places where appropriate, and the negative sign in the cash flow ratios indicates negative cash flow from operations.",
