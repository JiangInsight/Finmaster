Since total liabilities are not explicitly given, but total assets minus ownerâ€™s equity gives total liabilities:\n\nTotal Assets at end = 14,214,117.02  \nOwner's Equity at end = 13,835,266.51  \n\nTherefore:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Assets - Total Owner's Equity  \n= 14,214,117.02 - 13,835,266.51  \n= 378,850.51\n\nThis matches the total current liabilities only, indicating there are no non-current liabilities explicitly listed or they are managed within these figures. We will use this total liabilities number for the calculation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\\[\n= \\frac{-1,028,375.55}{378,850.51} \\approx -2.72\n\\]\n\nExpressed with two decimal places, this is approximately **-2.72**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Output:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-2.72\"}}\n```",
