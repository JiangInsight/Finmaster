                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided data step by step to compute each financial ratio and measure:\n\n### 1. **Current Ratio**\nCurrent Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 9,221,098.50\n- Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 9,221,098.50 / 378,850.51 ≈ 24.3\n\n**Note:** The initial example shows a current ratio of 4.27, but based on these figures, it's significantly higher. We'll report the calculated value.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Gross Profit Margin**\nGross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 1,622,011.03\n- Total Revenue = 2,637,011.03\n\nCalculation:\nGross Profit Margin = (1,622,011.03 / 2,637,011.03) × 100 ≈ 61.52%\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Debt to Asset Ratio**\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nLiabilities include:\n- Accounts Payable = 247,000.00\n- Taxes Payable = 131,850.51\n- Total Liabilities = 378,850.51\n\nTotal Assets = 14,214,117.02\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 378,850.51 / 14,214,117.02 ≈ 0.0267 or 2.67%\n\n*Note:* The example shows 0.14, but actual calculation yields ~0.027.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Net Profit Margin**\nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100\n\nNet Profit = 835,266.51\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (835,266.51 / 2,637,011.03) × 100 ≈ 31.69%\n\nThe example shows a negative margin; here, it's positive, indicating profit.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Cash to Current Debt Ratio**\nCash and Cash Equivalents = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable\n\n- Cash on Hand = 2,602,624.45\n- Bank Deposits = 4,283,110.81\n- Interest Receivable = 15,023.59\n\nTotal Cash = 2,602,624.45 + 4,283,110.81 + 15,023.59 ≈ 6,900,758\n\nCurrent Debt (Total Current Liabilities) = 378,850.51\n\nCalculation:\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = 6,900,758 / 378,850.51 ≈ 18.2\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**\nFCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,028,375.55\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets = 85,889.19\n\nCalculation:\nFCF = -1,028,375.55 - 85,889.19 ≈ -1,114,264.74\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Return on Assets (ROA)**\nROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) × 100\n\nTotal Assets = 14,214,117.02\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (835,266.51 / 14,214,117.02) × 100 ≈ 5.88%\n\n---\n\n### Final answer in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Current Ratio\": \"24.30\", \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"61.52%\", \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.0267\", \"Net Profit Margin\": \"31.69%\", \"Cash to Current Debt Ratio\": \"18.20\", \"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-1114264.74\", \"Return on Assets (ROA)\": \"5.88%\"}}\n```",
