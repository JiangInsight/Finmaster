                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided data step-by-step to calculate each financial ratio.\n\n### Step 1: Extract necessary values\n\n#### 1. Current Assets\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 9,221,098.50\n\n#### 2. Quick Assets\nQuick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory\n- Inventory = 203,000.00\n- Quick Assets = 9,221,098.50 - 203,000.00 = 9,018,098.50\n\n#### 3. Total Current Liabilities\n- 378,850.51\n\n#### 4. Total Assets\n- 14,214,117.02\n\n#### 5. Total Liabilities\nTotal liabilities = Total Assets - Owner's Equity\n- Owner's Equity = 13,835,266.51\n- Total Liabilities = 14,214,117.02 - 13,835,266.51 = 378,850.51\n\n**Note:** The sum of current liabilities (378,850.51) matches total liabilities in this case.\n\n#### 6. Owner's Equity\n- 13,835,266.51\n\n#### 7. Debt (Liabilities)\n- 378,850.51\n\n#### 8. Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n- -1,028,375.55\n\n#### 9. Short-term debt (Liabilities)\n- Same as total liabilities (since current liabilities include all liabilities here): 378,850.51\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Ratios\n\n#### Current Ratio\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{9,221,098.50}{378,850.51} \\approx 24.33\n\\]\nBut given previous data examples, ratios are usually rounded to 2 decimal places, and the example's value was about 4.27, so check calculation carefully.\n\nBut in this case, the ratio is quite high; let's re-check.\n\nActually, in the example, the ratio was around 4.27, but in ours, it's much higher given the basis. Let's verify:\n\nCalculation:\n\\[\n\\frac{9,221,098.50}{378,850.51} \\approx 24.33\n\\]\n\nSo, **Current Ratio â‰ˆ 24.33**\n\n#### Quick Ratio\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{9,018,098.50}{378,850.51} \\approx 23.8\n\\]\n\n#### Debt to Asset Ratio\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{378,850.51}{14,214,117.02} \\approx 0.0266\n\\]\n\nExpressed as a decimal: approximately 0.027\n\n#### Debt to Equity Ratio\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Owner's Equity}} = \\frac{378,850.51}{13,835,266.51} \\approx 0.0274\n\\]\n\n#### Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n- Net cash flow from operations: -1,028,375.55\n- Total debt (liabilities): 378,850.51\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} = \\frac{-1,028,375.55}{378,850.51} \\approx -2.71\n\\]\n\n### Final step: formatting answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"24.33\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"23.80\",\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.027\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.027\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-2.71\"\n  }\n}\n```",
