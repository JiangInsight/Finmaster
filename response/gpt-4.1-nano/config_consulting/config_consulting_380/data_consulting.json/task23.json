But since it's directly the ratio of cash flow to debt, the numerical value is about -2.71.\n\nTo match the example's format, we typically round to two decimal places.\n\n### Final Answers:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"61.53%\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-2.71\"\n  }\n}\n```",
