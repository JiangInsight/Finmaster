Since both are listed separately, the combined amount is the sum of these two components.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total initial cash and cash equivalents:\n3,000,000.00 (Cash on Hand) + 5,000,000.00 (Bank Deposits) = 8,000,000.00\n\nStep 4: Confirm if the \"Beginning Balance\" in the cash flow statement aligns with this amount.\n- The Beginning Balance listed in the cash flow section is 8,000,000.00, consistent with the sum of cash on hand and bank deposits.\n\nFinal answer: 8,000,000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"8000000.00\"}}\n```",
