These typically include expenses like sales commissions, marketing expenses, delivery, freight, and other costs directly associated with acquiring and fulfilling customer orders.\n\nIn the provided income statement, the relevant line items are:\n\n- Selling Expenses (which usually include costs related to marketing, sales commissions, distribution, and delivery)\n- Any specific mentioning of costs explicitly related to sales and distribution activities (not present here beyond Selling Expenses).\n\nGiven that, the \"Selling Expenses\" line item most directly corresponds to costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n1. Review all line items to determine which relate to sales acquisition and delivery.\n2. \"Selling Expenses\" are explicitly associated with sales activities, including securing orders.\n3. No other line items specifically titled for distribution or delivery costs.\n4. Therefore, the amount of \"Selling Expenses\" is the key figure to extract.\n\n**Value of Selling Expenses on the provided income statement:**\n- 402,699.98\n\n**Final answer:**\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"402699.98\"}}",
