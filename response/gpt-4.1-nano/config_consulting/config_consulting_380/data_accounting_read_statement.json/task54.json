Typically, expenses directly related to delivering goods and services, including selling and administrative expenses, are relevant.\n\nLooking at the provided income statement:\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold (COD) represents the direct costs of producing goods sold.\n- Selling Expenses include costs incurred to promote and deliver the product to customers, such as advertising, distribution, and sales commissions.\n- Administrative Expenses relate to general administrative functions but may not be directly tied to securing and delivering goods.\n\nHowever, since the task focuses specifically on costs related to securing customer orders and delivering goods/services, the most relevant line item is \"Selling Expenses,\" as these often include costs directly associated with the sales process and delivery.\n\nIn both examples provided, the answer was the \"Selling Expenses.\" Therefore, applying the same logic here:\n\n**Selling Expenses = 402699.98**\n\nHence, the line item and its value are \"Selling Expenses\" with the amount 402,699.98.\n\nwhere:\n- account: Selling Expenses\n- value: 402699.98\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '402699.98'} }\n```",
