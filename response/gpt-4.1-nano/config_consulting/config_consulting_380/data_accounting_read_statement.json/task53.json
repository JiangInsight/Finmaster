From the balance sheet:\n   - The inventory at the end of the period is given as 203,000.00.\n\n2. From the income statement:\n   - The Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is 1,015,000.00.\n\n3. Interpretation:\n   - The COGS represents the cost of the inventories sold during the period.\n   - The initial inventory is zero at the beginning of the period (as per the data provided for start).\n   - The ending inventory is 203,000.00.\n   - Since the initial inventory is zero, the inventory purchased during the period is equal to the COGS plus the ending inventory.\n\nHowever, for the purpose of identifying the specific line item for inventories sold, the key figure is the COGS, representing the carrying amount of inventories sold during the period.\n\nTherefore, the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is **1,015,000.00**.\n\nNow, presenting the answer in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1015000.00'} }\n```",
