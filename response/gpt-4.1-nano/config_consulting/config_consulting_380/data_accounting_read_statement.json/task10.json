The key line item indicating capital contributed by shareholders is \"Paid-in Capital.\"\n2. The \"Paid-in Capital\" line shows the amount invested by shareholders in exchange for shares.\n3. We examine the initial and end amounts for \"Paid-in Capital\" from the table.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Initial amount of Paid-in Capital: 13,000,000.00 (on 2023-12-31)\n- End amount of Paid-in Capital: 13,000,000.00 (on 2024-02-05)\n\nNote: The Paid-in Capital remains unchanged over the period, indicating no additional share capital was contributed.\n\nTherefore, the specific line items and values related to shareholder contribution are:\n\n- Initial value: 13,000,000.00\n- Final value: 13,000,000.00\n\nHere is the JSON formatted answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"13000000.00\", \"end value\": \"13000000.00\"}}\n```",
