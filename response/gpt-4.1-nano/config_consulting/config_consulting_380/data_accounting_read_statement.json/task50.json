Identify the four specific line items described in the task:\n   - Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life → This corresponds to **Depreciation**.\n   - Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale, in production for sale, or being manufactured during the period → Typically reflected as **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**.\n   - Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities related to acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and investments not included in cash equivalents, and receipt of interest and dividends → This is represented by **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**.\n   - Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period → This is the **Net Increase** in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n2. Extract the corresponding amounts from the input data:\n   - Depreciation: 92870.67\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Inventory: -203000.00\n   - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -85889.19\n   - Net Increase: -1114264.74\n\n3. These are matched in the order specified:\n   1. Depreciation\n   2. Reduction in assets (inventory change)\n   3. Cash flow from investing activities\n   4. Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '92870.67', 'value2': '-203000.00', 'value3': '-85889.19', 'value4': '-1114264.74'}}\n```",
