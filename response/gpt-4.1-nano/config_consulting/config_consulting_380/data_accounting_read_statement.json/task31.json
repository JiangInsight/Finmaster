                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided income statement to identify the profit or loss before tax and decompose it into the four component sub-items.\n\nStep 1: Identify the specific line item of profit or loss before tax and its value.\n- The line item \"Profit Before Tax\" shows the profit before deducting tax expenses.\n- According to the data, \"Profit Before Tax\" = 967117.02\n\nStep 2: Find the relevant financial data involved in calculating this profit before tax.\n- Typically, it includes total revenue, total costs, and other income/expenses.\n- From the data:\n  - Total Revenue = 2,637,011.03\n  - Total Cost (or expenses) = 669,917.60\n  - Interest Income = 15,023.59\n  - Financial Expenses = 37,809.98\n\nStep 3: Determine the four component sub-items of the profit before tax.\n- Common decompositions include:\n  1. Main Business Revenue (Initial value)\n  2. Total Cost (Initial value)\n  3. Total Expenses (including operating and financial expenses)\n  4. Financial Income (Interest Income)\n\n- Based on the example, the sub-items are:\n  - Main Business Revenue\n  - Total Cost\n  - Total Expenses\n  - Interest Income\n\nStep 4: Extract initial and final values for each sub-item.\n- Main Business Revenue: 2,637,011.03\n- Total Cost: 669,917.60\n- Total Expenses: in this context, it can be considered the total of all expenses including Operating expenses, Depreciation, Financial Expenses, etc., totaling 669,917.60 as given (including all expenses).\n- Interest Income: 15,023.59\n\n(Note: Since the example's decomposition is aligned with total revenue, total cost, total expenses, and interest income, we will follow the same approach.)\n\nNow, assemble the answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value\": \"967117.02\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value1\": \"2637011.03\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value2\": \"669917.60\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value3\": \"669917.60\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value4\": \"15023.59\"\n  }\n}\n```",
