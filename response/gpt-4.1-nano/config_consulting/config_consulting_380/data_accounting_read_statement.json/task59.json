For \"interest accrued but not yet received\":**  \nWe look for \"Interest Receivable\" in both the balance sheet and cash flow statement.  \n- Balance sheet \"Interest Receivable\": End_amount = 15023.59 (value as of 2024-02-05)  \n- Cash flow \" (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": -15023.59 (which indicates a decrease in interest receivable, i.e., interest received or adjusted)  \n- Income statement \"Interest Income\": 15023.59\n\nThe key is the *interest accrued but not yet received*, which is the interest receivable amount at the period end: **15023.59**\n\n**2. For \"net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents\":**  \nWe examine the cash flow statement:  \n- Beginning balance of cash and cash equivalents: 8000000.00  \n- Ending balance of cash and cash equivalents: 6885735.26  \n- Net increase (or decrease): -1114264.74\n\nThis net change in cash and cash equivalents during the period is the net addition (which can be negative indicating a decrease): **-1114264.74**\n\n---\n\n### Final extracted values:\n- **Interest accrued but not yet received**: 15023.59  \n- **Net addition in cash and cash equivalents**: -1114264.74\n\n---\n\n### Final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"15023.59\", \"value2\": \"-1114264.74\"}}\n```",
