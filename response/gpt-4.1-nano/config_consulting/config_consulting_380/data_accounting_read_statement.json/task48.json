The amount of profit retained after all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization. This typically corresponds to the \"Net Profit\" (also known as Net Income).\n\n2. The cash payments made to acquire property, plant, and equipment, and other long-term assets. These are typically part of the Investing Activities, and in the cash flow statement, the cash outflows related to the purchase of fixed assets (property, plant, equipment, etc.) are recorded as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\n---\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n**Step 1:** Find the line item representing profit after expenses:  \n- \"Net Profit\" is clearly listed as 835266.51.\n\n**Step 2:** Find the cash outflow for property, plant, and equipment:  \n- Under Investing Activities, \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is 85889.19.\n- Typically, this represents cash payments for long-term asset acquisition.\n\n**Step 3:** Confirm if these two items match the descriptions:  \n- The first one reflects profit retained after expenses (Net Profit).\n- The second one is the cash outflow for long-term assets (property, plant, equipment).\n\nBoth align with the problem's description.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"835266.51\", \"value2\": \"85889.19\"}}\n```",
