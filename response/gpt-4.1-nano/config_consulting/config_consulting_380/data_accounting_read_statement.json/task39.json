Since the problem refers to assets held for sale or in the process of being made ready for sale, inventory is the most relevant line item.\n\nThe decrease in inventory of -203000.00 indicates a reduction in assets held for sale or in production during this period.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and value are:\n\n**\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" | -203000.00**\n\nThe answer in the requested format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-203000.00'}}\n```",
