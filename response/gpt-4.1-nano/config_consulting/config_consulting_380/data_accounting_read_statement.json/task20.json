Typically, in an income statement, the value related to inventories sold is reflected in the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) line item.\n\nIn the given data:\n- \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is listed as 1015000.00 on 2024-02-05.\n\nSince the question asks for the carrying amount of inventories sold during the period, and the conventional line item for that in income statements is \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" the value we're looking for is 1,015,000.00.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n1. Review the provided income statement.\n2. Locate the line item that represents the cost associated with inventories sold.\n3. Confirm the amount listed for that item.\n4. Extract that value as it represents the carrying amount of inventories sold.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1015000.00'}}\n```",
