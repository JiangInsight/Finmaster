The key line item for the total amount of tax an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period is typically labeled as \"Tax Expense\" or similar.\n\nIn the balance sheet, \"Taxes Payable\" indicates the amount owed but not yet paid, whereas \"Tax Expense\" on the income statement shows the tax amount for the reporting period that the entity expects to pay.\n\nFrom the provided income statement, the \"Tax Expense\" is visible as a line item:\n- Tax Expense: 131850.51\n\nSince the task is to identify and extract the specific line items and value of total amount of tax payable or recover during the reporting period, the most relevant figure here is \"Tax Expense\" as it represents the tax amount accrued for that period.\n\nThe \"Taxes Payable\" in the balance sheet (e.g., 131850.51) reflects the amount owed at the period end, which aligns with the tax expense recorded in the income statement for the period.\n\nTherefore, the total tax amount expected to pay or recover during this period is 131,850.51.\n\nFinal answer formatted as per instructions:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"131850.51\"}}\n```",
