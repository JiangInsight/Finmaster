                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided balance sheet data step by step:\n\n1. The total amount of liabilities and equity is given by the line item \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" at both the initial and final dates:\n   - Initial value: 13,000,000.00\n   - Final value: 14,214,117.02\n\n2. The sub-items related to liabilities and equity are:\n   - Total Liabilities, which can be summed from \"Total Current Liabilities\" and other liabilities (if present). From the data:\n     - Initial liabilities: 0.00 (Current) + (No other liabilities listed) = 0.00\n     - Final liabilities: 378,850.51\n   - Total Owner's Equity:\n     - Initial: 13,000,000.00\n     - Final: 13,835,266.51\n\n3. Decomposing total liabilities and equity:\n   - Since liabilities are zero initially and increased to 378,850.51, and equity decreased from 13,000,000.00 to 13,835,266.51, but note that equity actually increased in final value, so the total change comes from adding liabilities.\n\n4. Calculating changes:\n   - Liabilities initial: 0.00 → final: 378,850.51\n   - Equity initial: 13,000,000.00 → final: 13,835,266.51\n\nFinal answer formatting:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"initial value\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"end value\": \"14214117.02\",\n    \"sub_items_initial sub_item value1\": \"0.00\",\n    \"sub_items_end sub_item value1\": \"378850.51\",\n    \"sub_items_initial sub_item value2\": \"13000000.00\",\n    \"sub_items_end sub_item value2\": \"13835266.51\"\n  }\n}\n```",
