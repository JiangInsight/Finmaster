Typically, expenses are items that decrease net income and are often labeled explicitly as expenses, costs, or similar.\n\nIn this problem, the relevant expense line item appears to be \"Accumulated Depreciation\" because it reflects depreciation expense recognized during the period. The initial value is 0.00, indicating no depreciation accumulated at the start, and the end value shows 92870.67, signifying depreciation expense recognized during the period.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n- Look for line items representing expenses in the statement; \"Accumulated Depreciation\" fits as an expense.\n- Note the initial value: 0.00\n- Note the end value: 92870.67\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '92870.67'}}\n```",
