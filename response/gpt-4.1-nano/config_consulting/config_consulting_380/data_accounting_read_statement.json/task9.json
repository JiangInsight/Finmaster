Typically, the second dataset is more recent.\n\nFrom the second dataset:\n- Initial value: 0.00  \n- Final value: 131850.51\n\nThis indicates that taxes accrued but not yet paid increased from 0 to 131,850.51.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"131850.51\"}}\n```",
