Identify the two specific line items:\n   - Income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities: This is typically represented by \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue.\"\n   - Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period: This is usually \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\n2. Confirm the exact line items:\n   - The first is \"Main Business Revenue\" with an amount of 2,637,011.03.\n   - The second is \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with an amount of 1,015,000.00.\n\n3. Maintain the original order as shown:\n   - First, the revenue (from \"Main Business Revenue\")\n   - Second, the inventory-related cost (\"Cost of Goods Sold\")\n\nFinal answer in the JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2637011.03', 'value2': '1015000.00'}}\n```",
