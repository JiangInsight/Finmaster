Review the line items:\n   - \"Cash on Hand,\" \"Bank Deposits,\" \"Interest Receivable,\" \"Accounts Receivable\" are not assets held for sale; they are trading or receivable assets.\n   - \"Inventory\" is usually the asset held for sale or in the process of being manufactured for sale.\n   - The total current assets include \"Inventory,\" but the total also includes other assets.\n\n2. Focus on the \"Inventory\" line item:\n   - Initial amount: 0.00 (probably not relevant, as inventory could be new or in process)\n   - End amount: 203000.00 (from the second table, for the latest date, reflecting current inventory held)\n\n3. Since inventory comprises assets meant for sale, the line item and value to extract are:\n   - Line item: Inventory\n   - Initial value: 0.00\n   - Final value: 203000.00\n\nHence, the asset held for sale during this period is inventory with a closing value of 203,000.\n\nFinal answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '203000.00'} }\n```",
