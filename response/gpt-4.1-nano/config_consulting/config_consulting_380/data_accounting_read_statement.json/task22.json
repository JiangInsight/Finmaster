The goal is to find the difference between revenue and cost, which is commonly known as gross profit.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n- Total Revenue = 2,637,011.03\n- Total Cost = 1,015,000.00\n\nCalculate the difference:\nGross Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost\nGross Profit = 2,637,011.03 - 1,015,000.00 = 1,622,011.03\n\nThis value is also explicitly listed as \"Gross Profit\" in the data, confirming our calculation.\n\nNow, present the answer as per the instruction:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"1622011.03\"}}\n```",
