From the balance sheet, the key line items related to depreciation are:\n   - \"Accumulated Depreciation\" which shows the total depreciation charged over time.\n   - \"Fixed Assets\" which are the assets being depreciated.\n\n2. From the cash flow statement, the line item \"Depreciation\" shows the depreciation expense recorded for the period, which is the allocation of the depreciable amount during the period.\n\n3. In the income statement, \"Depreciation\" appears and is consistent with the cash flow statement, indicating the expense recognized in the period.\n\n4. The question specifically asks for the line item and its value that represent the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount over the assetâ€™s useful life.\n\nThe key line item here is **\"Depreciation\"** with a value of **92,870.67** in the latest period. This value represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of the assets over their useful lives during this period.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe value of the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount during the period is **92,870.67**.\n\n**Answer in the required format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '92870.67'} }\n```",
