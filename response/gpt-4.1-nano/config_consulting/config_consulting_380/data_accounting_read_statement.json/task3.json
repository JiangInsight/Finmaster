We need to identify the line item(s) that represent amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit. This is typically recorded under \"Accounts Receivable.\"\n\n2. Both initial and end values are provided for \"Accounts Receivable.\"\n\n3. The initial value of \"Accounts Receivable\" is 0.00 (meaning no amounts owed initially).\n\n4. The end value of \"Accounts Receivable\" is 2,117,339.65.\n\n5. The task is to extract these initial and final values related to amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit.\n\nBased on this analysis, the line item is \"Accounts Receivable,\" with initial and end values noted.\n\nTherefore, the answer in the required format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"2117339.65\"}}\n```",
