Typically, these are non-current assets that are not actively used or are held for purposes other than immediate sale or consumption.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify total assets**: \n   - Initial total assets: 13,000,000.00\n   - End total assets: 14,214,117.02\n\n2. **Look at fixed assets**:\n   - These are long-term assets used in operations.\n   - Initial: 5,000,000.00\n   - End: 5,085,889.19\n   - These are typically expected to be used in operations, not held for resale.\n\n3. **Examine accumulated depreciation**:\n   - This reduces the value of fixed assets as they depreciate.\n   - Initial: 0.00\n   - End: 92,870.67\n   - This is a contra-asset related to fixed assets, not a separate asset held for sale.\n\n4. **Assess total non-current assets**:\n   - Initial: 5,000,000.00\n   - End: 4,993,018.52\n   - These are long-term assets, including fixed assets, possibly intangible assets, or other property held for use.\n\n5. **Determine if there are other assets**:\n   - No mention of intangible assets, investments, or other non-current asset types.\n   - The total non-current assets match the fixed assets less accumulated depreciation.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The fixed assets are not expected to be realized or intended for sale in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle; they are used for operations.\n\nTherefore, the line item corresponding to such assets is \"Fixed Assets.\"\n\n**Initial value** of fixed assets: 5,000,000.00  \n**End value** of fixed assets: 5,085,889.19\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"5000000.00\", \"end value\": \"5085889.19\"}}\n```",
