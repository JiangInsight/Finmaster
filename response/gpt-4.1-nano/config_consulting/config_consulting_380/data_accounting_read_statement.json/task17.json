We are asked to identify and extract two specific line items:\n   - The amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit.  \n   - The amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit.\n\n2. From accounting terminology:\n   - \"Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit\" corresponds to \"Accounts Receivable\".\n   - \"Amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit\" corresponds to \"Accounts Payable\".\n\n3. Look at the initial and end amounts for these line items:\n   - Accounts Receivable:\n     - Initial: 0.00\n     - End: 2,117,339.65\n   - Accounts Payable:\n     - Initial: 0.00\n     - End: 247,000.00\n\n4. Combine these values in the specified JSON output format.\n\n**Final output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"initial value1\": \"0.00\",\n    \"end valu1\": \"2117339.65\",\n    \"initial value2\": \"0.00\",\n    \"end valu2\": \"247000.00\"\n  }\n}\n```",
