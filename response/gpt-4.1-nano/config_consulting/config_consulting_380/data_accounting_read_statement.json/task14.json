Typically, these liabilities are current liabilities, which include accounts payable, taxes payable, and other short-term obligations.\n\nFrom the provided balance sheet data:\n\n- Initial values (2023-12-31):\n  - Accounts Payable: 0.00\n  - Taxes Payable: 0.00\n  - Total Current Liabilities: 0.00\n\n- End values (2024-02-05):\n  - Accounts Payable: 247,000.00\n  - Taxes Payable: 131,850.51\n  - Total Current Liabilities: 378,850.51\n\nWe focus on the change in these current liabilities:\n\n- Initial total: 0.00\n- Final total: 378,850.51\n\nSince these liabilities are current and are expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle, the total amount of liabilities expected to be settled is the final value at the end of the period.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of liabilities to be settled in the normal course of the operating cycle (initial and final values):\n\n- Initial amount: 0.00\n- Final amount: 378,850.51\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"378850.51\"}}\n```",
