The relevant section is **\"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\"**, which includes:\n    - Purchase of Fixed Assets (outflows).\n\n2. The value associated with *Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities* is **-85889.19**, which signifies the total net cash flow from investment activities.\n\n3. These activities typically involve:\n    - Purchase or sale of long-term assets (e.g., fixed assets), which affects cash flows.\n    - Receipt of interest and dividends, if included, are part of investing activities and reflected in the cash flow statement.\n\n4. For this particular statement:\n    - The line \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is **85889.19**, indicating a cash outflow for acquisition of long-term assets.\n    - There is no explicit line for sale of assets or investments, so the net investing cash flow already accounts for inflows and outflows.\n\n5. Since the net cash flow from investing activities is **-85889.19**, and this includes all related cash movements, the *net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from investing activities* corresponds directly to this figure.\n\n6. Regarding the sub-item decomposition:\n   - The main sub-item is the **\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\"** which has a value of **85889.19**.\n   \n7. The net decrease in cash due to investing activities (-85889.19) results from the purchase of assets.\n\n**Final deduction:**\n\n- The total net cash flow from investment activities is **-85889.19**.\n- The relevant sub-item (purchase of fixed assets) is **85889.19**.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value\": \"-85889.19\",\n    \"sub_item value\": \"85889.19\"\n  }\n}\n```",
