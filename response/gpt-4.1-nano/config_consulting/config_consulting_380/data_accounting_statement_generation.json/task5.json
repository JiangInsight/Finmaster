The first interest receivable recorded appears on 2024-01-01 with a value of 445.0, which indicates accrued interest.\n\nStep 2: Gather all interest receivables entries\n- Entries with \"Interest Receivables\" and \"Unpaid\" status indicate interest receivables at specific points.\n- The first interest receivable is recorded on 2024-01-01: 445.0\n- Subsequent interest receivables are recorded periodically, with the last one on 2024-02-05 showing 381.19686208999997.\n\nStep 3: Sum all interest receivable entries\n- Initial interest receivable (as per the first record): 445.0\n- Final interest receivable (latest record): 381.19686208999997\n\nStep 4: Determine the total interest receivable at the start and the end\n- The \"initial\" interest receivable considers the earliest uncollected interest, which is 445.0 on 2024-01-01.\n- The \"final\" interest receivable is the latest amount recorded for outstanding interest, which is approximately 381.20 on 2024-02-05.\n\nNote: The initial interest receivable balance was set at 445.0 on 2024-01-01, indicating accrued interest up to that point. The subsequent entries show interest accrued afterward, with remaining unpaid interest decreasing or staying around similar amounts, but only the earliest and latest recorded amounts are considered for initial and final balances.\n\nFinal step:\n- Initial Interest Receivable: 445.00\n- Final Interest Receivable: approximately 381.20\n\nNow, I will present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"445.00\", \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"381.20\"}}\n```",
