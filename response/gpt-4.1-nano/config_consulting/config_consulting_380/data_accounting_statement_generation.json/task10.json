                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided transactions step by step for the initial and final amounts of property, plant, and non-current assets.\n\n### Step 1: Identify initial non-current assets\nInitial amounts are given at the beginning of the data with an \"Initial\" label:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00\n\nTotal initial non-current assets = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = **13,000,000**\n\n### Step 2: Identify additions to non-current assets during the period\n- Fixed Asset Purchase on 2023-12-31: 305,354.43 (bank transfer)\n- Fixed Assets Purchase on 2023-12-31: 85889.19 (bank transfer)\n\nTotal additions = 305,354.43 + 85,889.19 = **391,243.62**\n\n### Step 3: Final non-current assets\nFinal recorded assets are likely updated after purchases:\n- The last fixed asset record: 85889.19 (office equipment)\n- The fixed asset purchase earlier in 2023: 305,354.43\n- The fixed asset purchase on 2023-12-31: 85,889.19\n\nTotal fixed assets at the end:\n- Sum of all fixed assets: 305,354.43 + 85,889.19 = 391,243.62\n\nAdditional assets:\n- Storage Facilities: 4 (as per latest info)\n- Office Equipment: 4 (as per latest info)\n\nAdding these relevant assets:\n- Storage Facilities: 4 units (asset type: Storage Facilities). Since no specific total for these units is provided, but in the initial data, the total for non-current assets was 5,000,000, and the new purchases have increased totals.\n\nThe last total non-current asset value in the data shows approximately **5,259,603.02**, which aligns with the sum of initial and subsequent assets recorded.\n\n### Final step:\n- Initial total: 13,000,000\n- Final total: 5,259,603.02 (per the last recorded value in the data)\n\n### Final answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"5259603.02\"}}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The initial non-current assets are taken from the record labeled \"Fixed Assets\" at the start, which is 5,000,000.\n- The final total is given directly in the last transaction indicating the total property, plant, and non-current assets at period end.\n\n**Note:** The initial value for non-current assets is 5,000,000 based on the first fixed assets record labeled \"Initial\" in the dataset, and the final total is 5,259,603.02 as per the last recorded total in the dataset.\n\n---\n\n**Final Output:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"5259603.02\"}}\n```",
