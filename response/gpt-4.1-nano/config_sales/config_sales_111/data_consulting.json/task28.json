Debt to Asset Ratio\nThis ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets financed by debt.\n\n- **Total Assets (End of period):** 15,653,266.97\n- **Total Liabilities (via current liabilities and other liabilities):**\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Accounts Payable = 1,260,000.00\n- Taxes Payable = 288,001.20\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n\nLiabilities are generally represented by current liabilities here; since no long-term liabilities are specified, we assume total liabilities equal current liabilities.\n\n**Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets**\n\n= 1,548,001.20 / 15,653,266.97  \n= approximately 0.0989 or **9.89%**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\nGross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100\n\nFrom income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 2,620,023.09\n- Total Revenue = 5,760,023.09\n\nGross Profit Margin = (2,620,023.09 / 5,760,023.09) × 100  \n≈ 0.4553 × 100 = **45.53%**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio measures the ability of operating cash flow to cover current liabilities.\n\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 803,237.11**\n- **Total Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20**\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\n≈ 803,237.11 / 1,548,001.20  \n≈ 0.5186\n\nWe often express this as a ratio, so approximately **0.52**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"9.89%\", \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"45.53%\", \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"0.52\"}}\n```",
