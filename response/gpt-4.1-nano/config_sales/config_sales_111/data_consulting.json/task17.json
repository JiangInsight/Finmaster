                        "content": "To calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio, we need two components:\n\n1. **Cash Flow from Operating Activities (CFO)**: This is directly given in the cash flow statement.\n2. **Total Debt**: Typically, this includes both short-term and long-term liabilities from the balance sheet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Extract Cash Flow from Operating Activities\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities** = 803,237.11\n\n### Step 2: Determine Total Debt\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Accounts Payable (Current Liability) = 1,260,000.00\n- Taxes Payable (Current Liability) = 288,001.20\n\nAssuming no other liabilities are provided, the total debt is the sum of these current liabilities.\n\n**Total Debt** = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 1,260,000.00 + 288,001.20 = 1,548,001.20\n\n*Note:* The balance sheet does not specify long-term debt. For this calculation, we will proceed with only the liabilities listed, assuming these are the total debts.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{803,237.11}{1,548,001.20} \\approx 0.5187\n\\]\n\nExpressed as a ratio:\n\n**â‰ˆ 0.52**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"0.52\"}}\n```",
