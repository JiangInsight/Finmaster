Return on Equity (ROE):\n\nROE = (Net Profit / Average Owner's Equity) * 100\n\n- Given:\n  - Net Profit = 1,105,265.77\n  - Owner's Equity at the end = 14,105,265.77 (from the ending balance of Total Owner's Equity)\n  - Assuming beginning owner’s equity is the same as initial, which is 13,000,000 (from initial balance), since it increased to 14,105,265.77.\n\n- Calculate the average owner's equity:\n  \n  Average Owner's Equity = (Beginning + Ending) / 2\n  = (13,000,000 + 14,105,265.77) / 2\n  = 13,552,632.885\n\n- ROE:\n  \n  = (1,105,265.77 / 13,552,632.885) * 100\n  ≈ 8.16%\n\n### 2. Debt to Asset Ratio:\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities + Total Non-Current Liabilities (which is Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable as liabilities)\n\n  - Accounts Payable = 1,260,000\n  - Taxes Payable = 288,001.20\n  - Total Liabilities = 1,260,000 + 288,001.20 = 1,548,001.20\n\n- Total Assets = 15,653,266.97\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio:\n\n  = 1,548,001.20 / 15,653,266.97 ≈ 0.0988\n\n  Approximately 0.10 or 9.88%. For simplicity, we can express as 0.10.\n\n### 3. Gross Profit Margin:\n\nGross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\n- Gross Profit = 2,620,023.09\n\n- Total Revenue = 5,760,023.09\n\n- Gross Profit Margin:\n\n  = (2,620,023.09 / 5,760,023.09) * 100 ≈ 45.53%\n\n---\n\n### Final answers in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '8.16%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.53%'} }\n```",
