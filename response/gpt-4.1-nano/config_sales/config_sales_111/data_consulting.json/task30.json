                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided data step-by-step to compute each financial ratio.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Extract relevant data\n\n**Assets:**\n- Total Current Assets (End): 10,261,562.67\n- Total Non-current Assets (End): 5,391,704.30\n- Total Assets (End): 15,653,266.97\n\n**Liabilities:**\n- Accounts Payable (End): 1,260,000.00\n- Taxes Payable (End): 288,001.20\n- Total Current Liabilities (End): 1,548,001.20\n\n**Equity:**\n- Total Owner's Equity (End): 14,105,265.77\n\n**Debt:**\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities (Current Liabilities + possibly Long-term debt). Since long-term debt isn't explicitly provided, assume Total Liabilities = Current Liabilities + No fixed long-term debt info. For simplicity, treat total liabilities as composed of current liabilities plus taxes payable (which is standard for current ratios).\n\n**Cash Flow data:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities (end): 803,237.11\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (Investing activities): 437,464.43\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate each ratio\n\n#### 1. **Current Ratio**\n- Formula: Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n- = 10,261,562.67 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 6.63\n\n#### 2. **Quick Ratio**\n- Formula: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n- Inventory: 430,000.00\n- = (10,261,562.67 - 430,000.00) / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 9,831,562.67 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 6.35\n\n#### 3. **Debt to Asset Ratio**\n- Formula: Total Debt / Total Assets\n- Total Debt (approximated as current liabilities + taxes payable): 1,548,001.20 + 288,001.20 ≈ 1,836,002.40\n- = 1,836,002.40 / 15,653,266.97 ≈ 0.117\n\n#### 4. **Debt to Equity Ratio**\n- Formula: Total Debt / Total Equity\n- = 1,836,002.40 / 14,105,265.77 ≈ 0.13\n\n#### 5. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**\n- Cash Flow from Operating Activities: 803,237.11\n- Total Debt: 1,836,002.40\n- Ratio: 803,237.11 / 1,836,002.40 ≈ 0.44\n- Since ratio typically indicates how many times cash flow can cover debt, a value below 1 suggests limited coverage.\n\n---\n\n### Final Step: Format the answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '6.63', 'Quick Ratio': '6.35', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.12', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.13', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.44'}}\n```\n\n**Note:** Rounded to two decimal places where appropriate.",
