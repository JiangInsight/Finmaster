Initial Accounts Receivable\n\nGiven the initial data, at the earliest date, December 31, 2023, there are no records labeled as receivables or unpaid sales prior to that date. The first relevant mention appears on January 1, 2024, where unpaid sales and interest receivables are recorded.\n\n- The earliest unpaid receivables are on:\n  \n  - 2024-01-02: Sale (C018) with after_tax_amount 52,235.38\n  - 2024-01-02: Interest Receivables (C018): 523.54\n  - 2024-01-03: Sale (C016): 58,117.50\n  - 2024-01-03: Interest Receivables (C016): 441.44\n  \n  - 2024-01-04: Sale (C014): 46,601.93\n  - 2024-01-04: Interest Receivables (C014): 435.21\n  \n  - 2024-01-05: Sale (C012): 61,364.00\n  - 2024-01-05: Interest Receivables (C012): 10.20345\n  \n  - 2024-01-06: Sale (C020): 30,912.00\n  - 2024-01-06: Interest Receivables (C020): 270.56\n\nAdditional unpaid sales and interest receivables from later dates are also present until the end of the dataset.\n\n**However, I will sum only the unpaid interest receivables recorded at the start of the period (before any payments or adjustments).**\n\n### 2. Final Accounts Receivable\n\n- As of the latest date (2024-01-28 to 2024-01-29), unpaid receivables are:\n\n  - 2024-01-28: Interest Receivables: 311.73\n  - 2024-01-29: Interest Receivables: 5.75\n  - 2024-01-30: Interest Receivables: 339.83\n  - 2024-01-23: Interest Receivables: 339.83\n  - 2024-01-24: Interest Receivables: 339.83\n  - 2024-01-25: Interest Receivables: 339.83\n  - 2024-01-26: Interest Receivables: 10.20\n  - 2024-01-27: Interest Receivables: 336.27\n  - 2024-01-17: Interest Receivables: 435.21\n  - 2024-01-19: Interest Receivables: 406.58\n  - 2024-01-21: Interest Receivables: 384.33\n  - 2024-01-22: Interest Receivables: 339.83\n  - 2024-01-23: Interest Receivables: 339.83\n  - 2024-01-24: Interest Receivables: 339.83\n  - 2024-01-25: Interest Receivables: 339.83\n  - 2024-01-28: Interest Receivables: 311.73\n  - 2024-01-28: Interest Receivables: 16.43\n  - 2024-01-29: Interest Receivables: 5.75\n  - 2024-01-30: Interest Receivables: 13.76 (or similar small amount possibly due to adjustments)\n  - 2024-01-31: (Note: No further data beyond the latest date, assume no additional unpaid interests)\n\n- Summing all unpaid interest receivables at the latest point:\n  - 339.83 + 5.75 + 339.83 + 339.83 + 339.83 + 10.20 + 336.27 + 435.21 + 406.58 + 384.33 + 339.83 + 339.83 + 339.83 + 339.83 + 311.73 + 16.43 + 5.75 + 13.76\n\nTotal approximate receivable interest at the latest date:\n= 339.83 + 5.75 + 339.83 + 339.83 + 339.83 + 10.20 + 336.27 + 435.21 + 406.58 + 384.33 + 339.83 + 339.83 + 339.83 + 339.83 + 311.73 + 16.43 + 5.75 + 13.76\n\nCalculating:\nSum = 339.83 * 8 (first 8 terms) = 2718.64\nPlus remaining: 5.75 + 10.20 + 336.27 + 435.21 + 406.58 + 384.33 + 339.83 * 6 (next 6 terms) = 339.83 * 6 = 2038.98\nSum of 339.83 six more times: 2038.98\nRemaining: 16.43 + 5.75 + 13.76 = 35.94\n\nAdding all:\nTotal = 2718.64 + 5.75 + 10.20 + 336.27 + 435.21 + 406.58 + 2038.98 + 35.94\n\nTotal ≈ 2718.64 + 5.75 + 10.20 + 336.27 + 435.21 + 406.58 + 2038.98 + 35.94\n≈ 2718.64 + 5.75 = 2724.39\n2724.39 + 10.20 = 2734.59\n2734.59 + 336.27 = 3070.86\n3070.86 + 435.21 = 3506.07\n3506.07 + 406.58 = 3912.65\n3912.65 + 2038.98 = 5951.63\n5951.63 + 35.94 ≈ 5987.57\n\n**The current unpaid interest receivables at the end of the period sum to approximately 5987.57.**\n\n---\n\n### 3.
