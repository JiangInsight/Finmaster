This involves calculating the total amount of sales on credit (unpaid sales) and subtracting the collections (cash received from receivables).\n\nStep 1: Identify all sales transactions and categorize whether they are cash sales or on account (receivables).\n\nStep 2: Sum all unpaid (on account) sales at the beginning of the period.\n\nStep 3: Sum all paid sales during the period.\n\nStep 4: The net change in accounts receivable is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{(Increase) / Decrease in Accounts Receivable} = \\text{Total Unpaid Receivables at the Start} + \\text{New Unpaid Sales} - \\text{Collections from Receivables} \\]\n\nFrom the given data, it appears the transactions are cumulative and cover the entire period.\n\nKey observations:\n\n- Unpaid sales are represented by transactions with \"Unpaid\" status.\n- Paid sales are represented by transactions with \"Paid\" status.\n- Interest receivable is a separate account and does not directly affect accounts receivable.\n\nNow, analyze the data:\n\n- Start of period (initial): The initial receivables aren’t explicitly listed, but the change is computed cumulatively.\n- Sum of all unpaid sales transaction amounts (accounts receivable) at the end of the period.\n- Sum of all cash collections from receivables during the period.\n\nCalculate the total unpaid receivables at the end:\n\n- Several sales are marked as \"Unpaid,\" with corresponding amounts.\n\nSum of unpaid receivables (examples):\n\n- 2024-01-03 | P002 | 110,532.58\n- 2024-01-04 | P003 | 274,663.86\n- 2024-01-04 | P002 | 23443.13\n- 2024-01-08 | P002 | 238740.93\n- 2024-01-12 | P003 | 184093.47\n- 2024-01-14 | P002 | 301969.04\n- 2024-01-18 | P003 | 193000.83\n- 2024-01-22 | P002 | 64583.68\n- 2024-01-23 | P001 | 52078.01\n- 2024-01-24 | P002 | 115401.58\n- 2024-01-24 | P001 | 48906.08\n- 2024-01-25 | P004 | 93760.7\n- 2024-01-26 | P003 | 102024.78\n- 2024-01-27 | P003 | 112072.83\n- 2024-01-28 | P001 | 24552.52\n- 2024-01-29 | P003 | 220302.45\n- 2024-01-29 | P004 | 175657.62\n- 2024-01-30 | P001 | 16420.16\n- 2024-01-30 | P004 | 82011.19\n- 2024-01-31 | P004 | 173051.28\n\nSum all unpaid receivables:\n\nTotal Unpaid (approximate sum from the provided values):\n\n= 110,532.58 + 274,663.86 + 23,443.13 + 238,740.93 + 184,093.47 + 301,969.04 + 193,000.83 + 64,583.68 + 52,078.01 + 115,401.58 + 48,906.08 + 93,760.7 + 102,024.78 + 112,072.83 + 24,552.52 + 220,302.45 + 175,657.62 + 16,420.16 + 82,011.19 + 173,051.28\n\nTotal ≈ 3,329,974.28\n\n- Total cash received from receivables during the period:\n\n  -
