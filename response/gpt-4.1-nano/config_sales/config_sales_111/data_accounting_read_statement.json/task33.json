The task asks for two specific line items:\n   - Income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities.\n   - Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\n2. Typically, income from core operating activities is represented by \"Main Business Revenue\" or a similar line item such as \"Total Revenue.\"\n\n3. The carrying amount of inventories sold during the period is represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\n4. Looking at the provided data:\n   - \"Main Business Revenue\" (or \"Total Revenue\") indicates core operating income.\n   - \"Cost of Goods Sold\" indicates inventories sold.\n\n5. The problem contains \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\"; both are closely related, but \"Main Business Revenue\" specifically refers to core operating income.\n\n6. Therefore, the two line items to extract are:\n   - Income from core operating activities: \"Main Business Revenue\" with amount 5760023.09\n   - Inventories sold: \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with amount 3140000.00\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5760023.09', 'value2': '3140000.00'}}\n```",
