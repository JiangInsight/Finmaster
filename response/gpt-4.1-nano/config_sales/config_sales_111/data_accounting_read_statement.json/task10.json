Locate the line item \"Paid-in Capital\" in the table.\n2. Extract both the initial and final values.\n3. Determine the change, which in this case is zero, indicating no additional share capital was contributed during this period.\n4. The initial and final contributed capital values are both 13,000,000.00.\n\n**Final answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13,000,000.00', 'end value': '13,000,000.00'} }\n```",
