The relevant line item is phrased as \"addition in the amount owed\" â€” this indicates an increase in liabilities related to credit purchases.\n2. Accounts payable (AP) directly reflects what the company owes for goods/services bought on credit.\n3. An increase in accounts payable during the period suggests additional credit purchases that remain unpaid.\n4. For the provided problem data:\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable = 1260000.00\n   - Since this is a positive figure, it indicates an increase (addition) in the amount owed.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item is \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable,\" and the value of the addition is 1,260,000.00.\n\nFinal answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1260000.00'}}\n```",
