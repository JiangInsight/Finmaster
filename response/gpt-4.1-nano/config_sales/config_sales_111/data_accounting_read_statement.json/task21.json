Typically, these are:\n\n- Main Business Revenue (or Revenue)\n- Total Revenue\n\nGiven the context, \"Main Business Revenue\" is the most specific line item indicating income from core operating activities.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Review the income statement for revenue-related items.\n2. Identify the line item that directly relates to core operational income. Usually, \"Main Business Revenue\" or similar is the key indicator.\n3. Extract the value associated with that line item.\n\nIn this case:\n- Main Business Revenue: 5760023.09 (on 2024-01-28)\n\nSince \"Main Business Revenue\" explicitly states core operating income, it is the precise figure we are asked to extract.\n\nFinal answer in specified JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5760023.09'}}\n```",
