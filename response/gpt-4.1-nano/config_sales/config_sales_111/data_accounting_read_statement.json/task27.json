According to accounting standards, this line item is commonly called \"Depreciation\" and reflects the amount allocated as depreciation expense during the period.\n\nLet's analyze the provided income statement step by step:\n1. The key line item we are looking for is \"Depreciation.\"\n2. In the data, the \"Depreciation\" figure for this period is 45760.13.\n3. This value reflects the systematic allocation of depreciation expense over the asset's useful life for the given period.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the exact value of the accumulated systematic allocation of the depreciable amount (i.e., depreciation expense for this period) is 45760.13.\n\nNow, formatting this into the specified JSON output.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"45760.13\"}}\n```",
