Usually, these items are listed separately or can be inferred from the context.\n\nIn the provided balance sheet data, the relevant line item appears to be \"Inventory,\" which often includes assets in production or in process of sale. The initial and end values of \"Inventory\" are directly relevant.\n\n- Initial Inventory value: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- End Inventory value: 430,000.00 (as of 2024-01-28)\n\nThese values represent assets that are in the process of being manufactured or held for sale.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n1. Scan the balance sheet for segments involved with assets that are in sale or in the process of being prepared for sale.\n2. The \"Inventory\" line item captures assets in the process of being manufactured or ready for sale.\n3. The initial and final values of \"Inventory\" are 0.00 and 430,000.00 respectively, indicating the assets in this state during the period.\n\n**Final answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"430000.00\"}}\n```",
