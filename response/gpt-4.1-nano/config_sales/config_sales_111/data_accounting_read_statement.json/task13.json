Typically, these include Non-current Assets (e.g., Fixed Assets less accumulated depreciation).\n\nStep 1: Look at the total non-current assets at initial and end values.\n- Initial value of Total Non-current Assets: 5000000.00\n- End value of Total Non-current Assets: 5391704.30\n\nStep 2: Determine if the change reflects assets not expected to be realized or consumed in a normal operating cycle. Since these are fixed assets (like property, plant, equipment), and their values increase, they are not typically intended for sale in the normal course.\n\nStep 3: The specific line item is \"Total Non-current Assets\" with its initial and final values.\n\nAnswer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5391704.30'} }\n```",
