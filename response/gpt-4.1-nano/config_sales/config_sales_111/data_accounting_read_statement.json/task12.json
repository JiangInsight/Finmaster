Current assets generally include cash, bank deposits, receivables, and inventory, which are typically expected to be converted into cash or used within that cycle.\n\nStep 1: Identify current assets at initial date (2023-12-31):\n- Cash on Hand: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank Deposits: 5,000,000.00\n- Interest Receivable: 0.00\n- Accounts Receivable: 0.00\n- Inventory: 0.00\n\nTotal initial current assets = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 8,000,000.00\n\nStep 2: Identify current assets at end date (2024-01-28):\n- Cash on Hand: 4,863,237.11\n- Bank Deposits: 3,502,535.57\n- Interest Receivable: 11,346.19\n- Accounts Receivable: 1,454,443.80\n- Inventory: 430,000.00\n\nTotal end current assets = 4,863,237.11 + 3,502,535.57 + 11,346.19 + 1,454,443.80 + 430,000.00 = 10,261,562.67\n\nThus, the line items and values relevant to assets expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal operating cycle are the current assets listed above.\n\nAnswer in the required format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10261562.67'}}\n```",
