The amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period — this corresponds to \"Accounts Payable\" change, indicating the increase or decrease in amounts owed.\n\n2. Acquisition of property, plant, and equipment — this is typically represented as the purchase of fixed assets.\n\n3. Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period — this is explicitly labeled as \"Beginning Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n- For the first item, look for \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\"  \n  The value is **1260000.00**.\n\n- For the second item, look for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\"  \n  The value is **437464.43**.\n\n- For the third item, look at \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" at the start of the period.  \n  The value is **8000000.00**.\n\nNow, ensure the order matches the example: first \"amount owed for goods/services received on credit,\" then \"acquisition of property, plant, and equipment,\" and finally \"cash and cash equivalents at the beginning.\"\n\nAnswer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1260000.00', 'value2': '437464.43', 'value3': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
