This is typically reported as \"Net Profit\" or \"Net Income.\"\n\nLooking at the provided data:\n\n- \"Net Profit\" for the date 2024-01-28 is 1,105,265.77.\n- Other relevant figures such as \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" (803,237.11) are not what we are asked for; we need the profit figure after all expenses, which is \"Net Profit.\"\n\nTherefore, the amount of profit retained after all expenses (i.e., the net profit) is **1105265.77**.\n\nNow, I'll format this as specified:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1105265.77'} }\n```",
