In the balance sheet, accounts related to liabilities for purchases on credit include \"Accounts Payable.\"\n2. The change in \"Accounts Payable\" from the beginning to the end of the period indicates an increase or decrease in what is owed for goods or services received on credit.\n3. The data shows:\n   - Starting \"Accounts Payable\" (Initial_amount): 0.00\n   - Ending \"Accounts Payable\" (End_amount): 1,260,000.00\n\nSince the initial was zero and the ending balance increased by 1,260,000, this increase represents additional amounts owed for goods or services received and purchased on credit during the period.\n\nThe amount of the increase is 1,260,000.00.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item is \"Accounts Payable,\" and the value of the addition is 1,260,000.00.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"1260000.00\"}}\n```",
