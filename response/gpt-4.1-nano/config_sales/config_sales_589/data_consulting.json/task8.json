                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided data step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Net Profit:**  \n   From the problem:  \n   `Net Profit = 1,193,771.08`\n\n2. **Identify Operating Cash Flow:**  \n   `Cash Flow From Operating Activities` is not directly provided, but the `Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities` is given as **-224,133.22**.  \n   Usually, \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" refers to net cash flow from operations, which in this context is **-224,133.22**.  \n   \n   To avoid confusion, since the problem explicitly asks for Operating Cash Flow, and the data presents `Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities` as **-224,133.22**, we will consider this as the Operating Cash Flow.\n\n3. **Calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Net Income}}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{-224,133.22}{1,193,771.08}\n   \\]\n\n   Proceed with the calculation:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{-224,133.22}{1,193,771.08} \\approx -0.1877\n   \\]\n\n   Since ratios are typically expressed as positive numbers, reflecting the magnitude of cash flow relative to net income, take the absolute value:  \n   \\[\n   \\approx 0.1877\n   \\]\n\n   To match the style from the example, round to two decimal places:  \n   \\[\n   0.19\n   \\]\n\n**Note:** The previous example's ratio was 4.41, which represents a positive multiple. Here, the negative sign results from negative operating cash flow, so interpret accordingly. For most financial analysis, the ratio considers absolute value unless specified otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"0.19\"}}\n```",
