                        "content": "First, understand the definition of the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:\n\n**Cash Flow to Debt Ratio** = (Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Debt)\n\nWhere:\n- **Cash Flow from Operating Activities** is obtained from the cash flow statement.\n- **Total Debt** typically includes all interest-bearing liabilities, such as short-term and long-term borrowings or liabilities that accrue interest. However, since the balance sheet does not explicitly list debt, we will assume \"Total Liabilities\" as the approximation for total debt unless specified otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Extract the relevant data\n\n**From the latest cash flow statement:**\n\nFor the current problem (latest date: 2024-01-28):  \n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities** = **-224133.22**\n\n**From the balance sheet:**\n\n- **Total Liabilities** (Current liabilities + Non-current liabilities)  \n  - Accounts Payable = 545,000  \n  - Taxes Payable = 284,755.77  \n  - Total Current Liabilities = 829,755.77  \n  - Since no long-term debt is specified, we assume total liabilities = total current liabilities = 829,755.77  \n\n**Note:** The total liabilities are often higher if there are long-term loans, but they are not provided explicitly here. Considering the context, weâ€™ll proceed with total liabilities as $829,755.77.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Compute the ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{-224133.22}{829755.77}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[\n\\approx -0.270\n\\]\n\nExpressed as a ratio, approximately **-0.27** (or -27%). Conventionally, ratios are often expressed with two decimal points.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.27\"}}\n```",
