Here, the income statements provide total revenue, which we will assume as net credit sales for calculation purposes.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate average Accounts Receivable\nFrom the balance sheet data:\n\n- **Initial Accounts Receivable (2023-12-31):** 0.00\n- **End Accounts Receivable (2024-01-28):** 1,562,598.26\n\nSince the beginning balance is zero and the end balance is given, the average for the period is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{0 + 1,562,598.26}{2} = 781,299.13\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Identify Net Credit Sales\nFrom the income statement:\n\n- **Total Revenue (assumed as credit sales):** 5,695,115.02\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nUsing the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{ART Ratio} = \\frac{5,695,115.02}{781,299.13} \\approx 7.28\n\\]\n\n### Final result:\nThe Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is approximately **7.28**.\n\n**Note:** Rounding to two decimal places.\n\n---\n\n**Answer in the required format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"7.28\"}}\n```",
