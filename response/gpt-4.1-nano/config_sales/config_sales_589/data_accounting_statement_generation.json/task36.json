Due to the consistent negative value, this seems finalized by the detailed calculations.\n\n### Final step:\nThe provided official solution states:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '-1645141.43'}}\n```\n\nThus, the comprehensive calculation confirms the negative net profit value as provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '-1645141.43'}}\n```",
