But these affect inventory and receivables, not direct paid-in capital.\n\n- In the given data, there are no further recorded injections of capital after initial entries.\n\n- All subsequent transactions involve purchases, sales, expenses, and receivables, but no additional capital contributions are documented.\n\n- Since no additional capital injections or reductions are explicitly recorded, the final paid-in capital remains the same as the initial.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- Initial paid-in capital = 13,000,000\n- Final paid-in capital = 13,000,000\n\n---\n\n**Answer in the required format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
