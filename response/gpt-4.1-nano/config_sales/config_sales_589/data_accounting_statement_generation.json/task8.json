Since we see depreciation recorded on 2024-01-01, this is most likely the first depreciation entry, and thus the initial value is zero before this record.\n\n- The recorded depreciation at the date is approximately 45751.41 (from first dataset), which is the accumulated depreciation value at that point.\n\n- The next depreciation entry recorded also on the same date shows about 45749.3, the close value suggests the depreciation accumulated up to that point.\n\n- Since the first dataset shows the depreciation amount as 45751.41 and this is the first depreciation recording, the initial accumulated depreciation prior to this date would be zero.\n\n- The final accumulated depreciation value at the end of the period (latest date in the data) is the last depreciation record: 45751.41 (from the first dataset) or 45749.3 (from the second dataset). They are very close and likely represent the same depreciation entry, but the first dataset shows a slightly higher value (probably due to rounding).\n\n- To be consistent, the latest value after all transactions (assuming the last depreciation record) is 45751.41.\n\nConclusion:\n- Initial accumulated depreciation: 0.00\n- Final accumulated depreciation: 45751.41\n\nFinal answer in specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"45751.41\"}}\n```",
