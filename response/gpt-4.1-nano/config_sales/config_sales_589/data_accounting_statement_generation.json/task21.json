It appears the total revenue considers all sales regardless of payment status, based on the example.\n\nFinal decision: sum of all sales listed, regardless of payment status, equals **5431018.59**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final main business revenue item in the income statement is **5431018.59**.\n\n---\n\nNow, presenting the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Main Business Revenue\": \"5431018.59\"}}\n```",
