From the data, relevant items are:\n\n- Cash deposit\n- Bank deposit\n- Accounts receivable (interest receivables, sales receivables)\n\n2. **Initial amounts:**\n\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000 (not included in current assets)\n\nInitial current assets total = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = **8,000,000**\n\n3. **Final amounts:**\n\n- **Cash:** Sum of all cash transactions:\n  - Multiple cash inflows from sales or transfers\n  - Deducted by expenses (mostly paid in cash)\n  - Receivables: some sales are paid in cash, some on account\n  \n  For simplicity, actual cash flows in the dataset and cash deposit/transfer entries are considered.\n  \n  The detailed cash transactions over time suggest the main cash balance is around 2,796,806.47 (from the last balance at the end of the period). Using the total cash-related movements, the final cash balance is approximately 2,796,806.47.\n\n- **Bank deposits:** Sum of all bank transfers and bank purchases:\n  \n  The last recorded bank deposit after all transfers and purchases totals to approximately 4,108,692.00.\n\n- **Accounts Receivable:**\n  \n  Unpaid sales and interest receivables at the end of the period:\n  \n  - C006: 4,820.38\n  - C014: 2,604.50\n  - C017: 8,177.84\n  - C018: 9,511.76\n  - C020: 6,413.96\n  - C015: 3,599.08\n  - C011: 21,468.72\n  - C009: 10,157.94\n  \n  Summing these: 4,820.38 + 2,604.50 + 8,177.84 + 9,511.76 + 6,413.96 + 3,599.08 + 21,468.72 + 10,157.94 ≈ **66,753.18**\n\n4. **Total Final Current Assets:**\n\n- Cash: approx 2,796,806.47\n- Bank deposits: approx 4,108,692.00\n- Receivables: approx 66,753.18\n\nTotal = 2,796,806.47 + 4,108,692.00 + 66,753.18 ≈ **6,972,251.83**\n\n5. **Rounding:**\n\nRound to two decimal places as per standard financial reporting.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Total Current Assets End Value': '6972251.83'}}\n```",
