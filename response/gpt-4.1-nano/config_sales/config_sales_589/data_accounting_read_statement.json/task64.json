From both balance sheets, it's consistently 13,000,000.00 with no change.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Extract the end value of profit or loss before tax  \n\"Profit Before Tax\" on the income statement for the latest period: **1478526.85**\n\n### Step 3: Extract the increase in liabilities for goods or services purchased on credit  \nChange in Accounts Payable:  \nEnd amount: 545,000.00\n\n### Step 4: Extract the capital contributed by shareholders  \n\"Paid-in Capital\": 13,000,000.00\n\n---\n\n### Final groupings:\n\n- **Balance Sheet:**  \n  - Capital contributed by shareholders: **13,000,000.00**\n\n- **Income Statement:**  \n  - Profit before tax: **1478526.85**\n\n- **Cash Flow Statement:**  \n  - Increase in amount owed for goods/services (Accounts Payable): **545,000.00**\n\n---\n\n### Final answer in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1478526.85', 'value3': '545000.00'} }\n```",
