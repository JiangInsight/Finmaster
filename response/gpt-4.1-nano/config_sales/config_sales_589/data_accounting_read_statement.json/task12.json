Identify current assets:\n   - Cash on Hand: initial and end values are provided.\n   - Bank Deposits: initial and end values are provided.\n   - Interest Receivable: initial is 0, end is 10811.11.\n   - Accounts Receivable: initial 0, end 1562598.26.\n   - Inventory: initial 0, end 720000.00.\n\n2. These are the line items associated with assets that are either cash, receivables, or inventory, all of which are expected to be realized or used in the normal business cycle.\n\n3. Summing the initial and end values of these items:\n\n   Initial total assets expected for realization:\n   - Cash on Hand: 3,000,000.00\n   - Bank Deposits: 5,000,000.00\n   - Interest Receivable: 0.00\n   - Accounts Receivable: 0.00\n   - Inventory: 0.00\n\n   Total initial value = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 8,000,000.00\n\n   End total assets expected for realization:\n   - Cash on Hand: 3,730,866.78\n   - Bank Deposits: 3,938,781.80\n   - Interest Receivable: 10,811.11\n   - Accounts Receivable: 1,562,598.26\n   - Inventory: 720,000.00\n\n   Total end value = 3,730,866.78 + 3,938,781.80 + 10,811.11 + 1,562,598.26 + 720,000.00 = 9,963,057.95\n\nThe sum of the current assets in the initial and end columns gives us the expected assets to be realized or used in the normal operating cycle.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"9963057.95\"}}\n```",
