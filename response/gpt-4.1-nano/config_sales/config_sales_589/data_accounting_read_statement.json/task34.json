In the table, this is the \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**:  \n   This is represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" indicating the cost associated with inventory that was sold.\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**:  \n   This corresponds to \"Administrative Expenses,\" which relate to the entity's management and administration.\n\nNow, extracting the specific values:\n\n- **Total income arising in the course of ordinary activities** = Main Business Revenue = 5695115.02  \n- **Carrying amount of inventories sold** = Cost of Goods Sold = 3085000.00  \n- **Costs of general management and administration** = Administrative Expenses = 399315.81\n\nFinally, presenting in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5695115.02', 'value2': '3085000.00', 'value3': '399315.81'}}\n```",
