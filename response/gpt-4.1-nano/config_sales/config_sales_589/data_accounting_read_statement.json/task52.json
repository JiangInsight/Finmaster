Since the problem explicitly asks for the initial and final values of such capital, we look at the \"Paid-in Capital\" entries at both dates.\n\nFrom the provided balance sheet data:\n\n- Initial Paid-in Capital (2023-12-31): 13,000,000.00\n- Final Paid-in Capital (2024-01-28): 13,000,000.00\n\nThere is no change in the \"Paid-in Capital\" between the initial and final dates, indicating no additional capital was contributed during this period; the initial shareholders' contribution remains the same at the end.\n\nThus, the specific line items are \"Paid-in Capital\" with initial and final values both at 13,000,000.00.\n\nAnswer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"13000000.00\", \"end value\": \"13000000.00\"}}\n```",
