Look for the account that reflects amounts owed by customers for goods/services sold on credit.\n2. In accounting terms, this is generally \"Accounts Receivable.\"\n3. Extract the initial and end values of \"Accounts Receivable\" from the provided data.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Initial value of Accounts Receivable (2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End value of Accounts Receivable (2024-01-28): 1,562,598.26\n\nThis represents the amounts owed to the entity on credit at the start and end of the period.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"1562598.26\"}}\n```",
