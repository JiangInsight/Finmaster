In financial statements, this is typically found under a line item labeled \"Tax Expense\", \"Tax Paid\", \"Income Tax Payable\", or similar.\n\nLooking at the provided data:\n\n- In the income statement, the line \"Tax Expense\" appears with an amount of 284755.77 (for the respective period). This indicates the tax that the entity is expected to pay during the period. \n\n- In the cash flow statement, the line \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" is 284755.77, matching the tax expense, which further confirms this is the expected tax payment.\n\nTherefore, the relevant line item and its value for total expected tax to pay or recover during this reporting period are the \"Tax Expense\" amount of 284755.77.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '284755.77'} }\n```",
