In the provided income statements, the relevant line items are:\n\n- \"Selling Expenses\" in the income statements.  \n- In the cash flow statements, these costs arenâ€™t explicitly shown but are directly associated with operating activities.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n- First problem's income statement shows \"Selling Expenses\" as 493,854.67 (first problem)\n- Second income statement shows \"Selling Expenses\" as 555,218.93 (second problem)\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the second required line item \"cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.\"**\n\nThis relates to cash flow from investing activities, specifically \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the cash flow statements.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n- First problem's cash flow shows \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = 305,354.43\n- Second problem's cash flow shows \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = 106,218.20\n\nSince the task involves the specific line items, and the examples match this pattern, the two costs are:\n\n- Costs to secure and deliver to customers: \"Selling Expenses\"\n- Payments for property, plant, and equipment: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\"\n\n**Step 3: Final answer grouping**\n\nThe outputs are to be grouped as:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': 'Selling Expenses', 'value2': 'Purchase of Fixed Assets'}}\n```\n\nBecause the instructions specify to give the value (amounts), but the example outputs show descriptions, and the input asks to identify the line items and their values, I will assign values accordingly.\n\n**Final step:**  \nExtract the values:\n\n- Selling Expenses (from first problem's income statement): 493,854.67\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (from first problem's cash flow): 305,354.43\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '493854.67', 'value2': '305354.43'}}\n```",
