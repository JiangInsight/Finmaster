Initial amount of interest receivable (at the start date): 0.00\n2. End amount of interest receivable (at the end date): 10811.11\n\nSince the initial interest receivable was zero and now it is 10811.11, this increase reflects the accrued interest that has not yet been received during the period.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Initial value of interest accrued but not yet received: 0.00\n- Final value of interest accrued but not yet received: 10811.11\n\nAnswer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '10811.11'} }\n```",
