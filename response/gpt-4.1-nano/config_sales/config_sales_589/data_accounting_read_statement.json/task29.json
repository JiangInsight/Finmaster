In income statements, this is typically reflected by the \"Total Revenue\" line.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n- Total Revenue = 5695115.02\n\nNext, decompose this total income into a component sub-item that also originates from the statement. Usually, \"Main Business Revenue\" is the primary component of \"Total Revenue.\"\n\nThe \"Main Business Revenue\" is given as 5695115.02, which matches the total revenue, indicating it serves as the component sub-item.\n\nNow, prepare the output in the required JSON format, clearly stating the total income and its component sub-item with their initial and final values.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"5695115.02\", \"sub_item value\": \"5695115.02\"}}\n```",
