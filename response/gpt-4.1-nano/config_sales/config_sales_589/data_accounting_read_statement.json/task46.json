                        "content": "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the relevant line items related to cash flow from investing activities, specifically:\n   - The acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments (not included in cash equivalents)\n   - Receipt of interest and dividends\n\n2. From the provided data, the key line item is:\n   - \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" which is -106218.20\n\n3. According to the problem, the net amount derived from these activities should be decomposed into sub-items:\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets (a cash outflow for acquisition of long-term assets), which is 106218.20\n\n4. The net cash flow from investing activities in this case appears to only involve the purchase of fixed assets (no other investments or receipt of interest/dividends are explicitly listed).\n\n5. Since there's no explicit indication of cash inflows from asset disposals or receipt of interest/dividends, the main component is the purchase of fixed assets.\n\n6. Therefore:\n   - The net amount of cash from these activities: -106218.20\n   - Sub-item (component): Purchase of Fixed Assets: 106218.20\n\nNow I will prepare the JSON output accordingly.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-106218.20\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"106218.20\"}}\n```",
