The task asks for the \"carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period,\" which typically corresponds to the inventory value at the start of the period, the purchase and usage during the period, or the cost of goods sold related to inventory. \n\nIn the provided balance sheet, the \"Inventory\" account shows the ending inventory value, but it is not directly the amount sold. However, the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) in the income statement indicates the cost associated with the inventory that has been sold during the period.\n\nGiven that, the specific line item for inventory sold is best represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" which reflects the carried amount of inventories that were sold during the reporting period.\n\nIn the second problem:\n- \"Cost of Goods Sold\" = 3,085,000.00\n\nThis value represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the period.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" amount.\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3085000.00'} }\n```",
