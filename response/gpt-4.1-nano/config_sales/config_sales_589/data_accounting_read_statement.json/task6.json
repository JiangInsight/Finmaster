These items are usually recorded under \"Fixed Assets\" with initial and end values, and may include land, buildings, machinery, equipment, furniture, vehicles, etc.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n- The line \"Fixed Assets\" directly represents tangible items used in operations.\n- The initial value of Fixed Assets is 5,000,000.00.\n- The final value of Fixed Assets is 5,106,218.20.\n\nThese values align with tangible assets used across operations over the period.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n1. Identify fixed or tangible assets: \"Fixed Assets.\"\n2. Record their initial value: 5,000,000.00.\n3. Record their end value: 5,106,218.20.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item is \"Fixed Assets\" with the associated initial and final values.\n\n**Final answer in the required JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"5000000.00\", \"end value\": \"5106218.20\"}}\n```",
