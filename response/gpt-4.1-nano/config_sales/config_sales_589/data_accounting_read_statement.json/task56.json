Look for the depreciation amount in the income statement. It should be labeled as \"Depreciation\" or similar.\n2. Verify the depreciation amount listed in the income statement; in this case, it appears as \"Depreciation\" with a value of 45,749.30.\n3. Check the cash flow statement for confirmation of depreciation as a non-cash expense. It is listed as 45,749.30, consistent across statements.\n4. The depreciation expense indicates the systematic allocation of the assetâ€™s depreciable amount over its useful life.\n\nThus, the depreciation expense amount, representing the systematic allocation, is 45,749.30.\n\nAnswer:\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45749.30'} }",
