These typically include short-term (current) liabilities such as accounts payable and taxes payable.\n\nStep 1: Identify potential liabilities\n- Accounts Payable (current liability)\n- Taxes Payable (current liability)\n\nStep 2: Extract initial and end values for these liabilities\n- Accounts Payable:\n  - Initial: 0.00\n  - End: 545,000.00\n- Taxes Payable:\n  - Initial: 0.00\n  - End: 284,755.77\n\nStep 3: Sum the end values for current liabilities\n- Total liabilities expected to be settled within the operating cycle:\n  - 545,000.00 + 284,755.77 = 829,755.77\n\nStep 4: Prepare the answer in the specified format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"initial value\": \"0.00\",\n    \"end value\": \"829755.77\"\n  }\n}\n```",
