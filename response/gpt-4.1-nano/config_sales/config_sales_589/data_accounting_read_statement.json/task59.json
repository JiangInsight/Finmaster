Since the task asks for interest accrued but not yet received, the relevant line item is \"Interest Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n   From the balance sheet:\n   - Interest Receivable: 10,811.11 as of 2024-01-28.\n\n2. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**  \n   This refers to the change in cash and cash equivalents from the beginning to the end of the period. This can be calculated as:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Net increase in cash and cash equivalents} = \\text{Ending Balance} - \\text{Beginning Balance}\n   \\]\n   \n   From the cash flow section:\n   - Beginning Balance: 8,000,000.00\n   - Ending Balance: 7,669,648.58\n\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   7,669,648.58 - 8,000,000.00 = -330,351.42\n   \\]\n\nSo, the two values are:\n- Interest accrued but not yet received: **10,811.11**\n- Net addition to cash and cash equivalents: **-330,351.42**\n\nFinally, I need to present these in the specified JSON format.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '10811.11', 'value2': '-330351.42'}}\n```",
