Since we are asked to identify the line item that reflects an addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit, we are looking for changes related to liabilities or accounts payable.\n\n2. The relevant line item to look at is \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\" An increase in accounts payable indicates the entity has purchased goods or services on credit and hasn't yet paid for them, which increases the amount owed.\n\n3. The value for this line item in the given statement is 545,000.00, showing an increase in accounts payable during the period, meaning the entity's credit purchases increased by this amount.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and value of the addition in the amount owed (credit purchases) are:\n\n**\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": 545000.00**\n\nNow, constructing the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '545000.00'}}\n```",
