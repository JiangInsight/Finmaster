The end value of funds deposited into a bank.\n  2. Income earned by an entity from financial assets.\n\nFrom the balance sheet, the relevant line item for the funds deposited into a bank is typically labeled as \"Bank Deposits\" (sometimes also as \"Cash and Bank Deposits\" depending on the terminology). Here, \"Bank Deposits\" at the end date is 3,938,781.80.\n\nFor the income earned from financial assets, that would usually be reflected as \"Interest Income\" in the income statement, but in the balance sheet you might find it as \"Interest Receivable\" (if accrued) or part of \"Cash and Cash Equivalents,\" but given the structure, \"Interest Receivable\" at the end amount is 10,811.11, which represents accrued interest income but not realized yet.\n\nTherefore:\n- Funds deposit into a bank (end of period): **3,938,781.80**\n- Income earned from financial assets (interest income): **10,811.11**\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"3938781.80\", \"value2\": \"10811.11\"}}\n```",
