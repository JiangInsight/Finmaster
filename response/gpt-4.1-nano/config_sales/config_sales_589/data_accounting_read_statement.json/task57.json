Note the initial amount and the end amount:\n- Initial_amount (2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End_amount (2024-01-28): 545,000.00\n\nStep 3: Since \"Accounts Payable\" increased from 0 to 545,000.00 during the period, this indicates new credit purchases or goods/services received on credit amounting to 545,000.00.\n\nStep 4: Check other liabilities such as Taxes Payable, but since these are related to taxes, not goods/services, ignore them for this specific task.\n\nStep 5: Confirm no other liabilities related to purchase credits are listed, so the main increase relevant here is \"Accounts Payable.\"\n\nConclusion: The increase in accounts payable during the period is 545,000.00.\n\nFinal answer in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"545000.00\"}}\n```",
