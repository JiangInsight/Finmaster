First line item: \"amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period\"  \n   - This typically corresponds to accounts like Accounts Payable, which increase when the entity makes purchases on credit.  \n   - In the statement, the relevant line is: \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with an amount of 545000.00.\n\n2. Second line item: \"acquisition of property, plant and equipment\"  \n   - This relates to cash outflows for purchasing fixed assets, often labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"  \n   - In the statement, this is: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an amount of 106218.20.\n\n3. Third line item: \"cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period\"  \n   - This is directly given as \"Beginning Balance\" in the cash flow statement, which is 8000000.00.\n\nNow, following the original order:\n\n- First: amount owed (credit purchases) — 545000.00  \n- Second: acquisition of property, plant, and equipment — 106218.20  \n- Third: beginning cash and cash equivalents — 8000000.00\n\nFinal step: format the answer as per instructions.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '545000.00', 'value2': '106218.20', 'value3': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
