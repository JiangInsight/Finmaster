The amount of profit retained after all expenses (which is essentially net profit or net income).\n2. The cash payments made to acquire property, plant, and equipment (which are reflected as purchases of fixed assets in the investing activities section).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the profit (net income)**\n\n- The line \"Net Profit\" shows the profit after all expenses, taxes, interest, etc. Since this is a cash flow statement, the \"Net Profit\" listed here is the profit figure we're looking for.\n- From the provided data, **Net Profit = 1193771.08**\n\n**Step 2: Identify the cash payment for property, plant, and equipment**\n\n- The line \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" indicates cash paid for property, plant, and equipment.\n- From the provided data, **Purchase of Fixed Assets = 106218.20**\n\n**Step 3: Present the answer in the required JSON format as per instructions**\n\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value1\": \"1193771.08\",\n    \"value2\": \"106218.20\"\n  }\n}\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"1193771.08\", \"value2\": \"106218.20\"}}\n```",
