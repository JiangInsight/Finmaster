The income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities—this generally corresponds to the main revenue generated from core business operations, which is typically labeled as \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n2. The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period—this is commonly represented as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n- First, locate the line item that indicates the revenue generated from the core operating activities. In the provided table, this is \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n- Extract the corresponding amount for this line item.\n- Next, locate the line item that shows the cost associated with the inventories sold, which is usually \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n- Extract the corresponding amount for this line item.\n\nNow, applying these steps to the given data:\n\n- \"Main Business Revenue\" amount: 5695115.02\n- \"Cost of Goods Sold\" amount: 3085000.00\n\nThese are the two required values.\n\nFinal answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5695115.02', 'value2': '3085000.00'}}\n```",
