Examine the provided cash flow statement for relevant line items.\n2. Look for entries that mention \"Tax Payable\" or similar.\n3. The line \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" reflects changes in tax liabilities.\n4. An increase in tax payable indicates more taxes accrued but not yet paid.\n\nIn the provided data:\n- The line \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" has the value **284755.77** on 2024-01-28.\n\nSince the question asks specifically about the increase in tax accrued but not yet paid, the correct line item is \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with the corresponding value.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '284755.77'}}\n```",
