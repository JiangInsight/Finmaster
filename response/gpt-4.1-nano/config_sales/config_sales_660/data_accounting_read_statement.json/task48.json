The goal is to find the amount of profit retained after all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, have been deducted from total revenue, i.e., net profit.\n\n2. The first line to look at is \"Net Profit\" which in this case is 707,199.17.\n\n3. The instructions specify that we also need to identify the second value related to cash payments for property, plant, and equipment, which is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" listed under the investing activities section as 528,936.17.\n\n4. The net income (profit) is directly given as \"Net Profit\".\n\n5. The cash payments for acquiring property, plant, and equipment are given as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n\nBased on the task, the two specific line items and their values are:\n\n- The net profit after all expenses (Net Profit): 707,199.17\n- The cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment (Purchase of Fixed Assets): 528,936.17\n\nNow, presenting the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '707199.17', 'value2': '528936.17'}}\n```",
