This indicates that other components or different arrangements might be involved, or perhaps the \"Interest Income\" and \"Financial Expenses\" are already accounted for in Total Expenses.\n\n   Given that Total Expenses include Financial Expenses and other expenses, and that the profit before tax is directly provided, perhaps the breakdown of the components into sub-items is straightforward:\n\n   **Alternatively**, since the actual profit before tax is provided directly as **960446.16**, and the inputs come from the same level as the total revenue and total expenses, a reasonable decomposition involves:\n   \n   - **Main revenue**: Total Revenue\n   - **Total expenses**: Total Expenses\n   - **Financial Income**: Interest Income\n   - **Financial Expenses**: Financial Expenses\n\n5. **Prepare the final JSON output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value\": \"960446.16\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item1\": \"5064939.23\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item2\": \"1378460.51\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item3\": \"8967.44\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item4\": \"226258.90\"\n  }\n}\n```",
