We are looking for the line item that shows the profit or loss retained in the entity, which is typically represented by \"Retained Earnings\" on the balance sheet.\n\n2. For this problem, the initial value of \"Retained Earnings\" is 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31).\n\n3. The final value of \"Retained Earnings\" is 707,199.17 (as of 2024-01-29).\n\n4. The increase in retained earnings from initial to end reflects the profit retained in the entity during the period.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item of interest is \"Retained Earnings\" with an initial value of 0.00 and an end value of 707,199.17.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '707199.17'}}\n```",
