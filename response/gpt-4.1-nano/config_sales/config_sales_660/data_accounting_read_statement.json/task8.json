These accounts reflect liabilities due for goods or services received on credit.\n\nExamining the data:\n\n- **Accounts Payable**: Initial amount is 0.00, final amount is 1,240,000.00\n- **Taxes Payable**: Initial amount is 0.00, final amount is 253,246.99\n\nBoth accounts relate to amounts owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit.\n\nHowever, the core focus seems to be on trade payables, i.e., \"Accounts Payable,\" which directly indicates amounts owed to suppliers for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\n**Therefore:**\n- Initial amount owed for goods/services on credit: 0.00\n- Final amount owed for goods/services on credit: 1,240,000.00\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe relevant line item is \"Accounts Payable\" with initial and end values as identified.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"1240000.00\"}}\n```",
