Review the list of line items from the income statement.\n2. Specifically look for any line that mentions \"Tax\" or \"Tax Expense.\"\n3. The line \"Tax Expense\" indicates the amount of tax payable or recoverable during the period.\n4. The value associated with \"Tax Expense\" is what needs to be extracted.\n\nIn this case:\n- The line \"Tax Expense\" shows an amount of 253246.99.\n\nThus, the specific line item \"Tax Expense\" with value 253246.99 is the total amount of tax expected to be paid or recovered.\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"253246.99\"}}\n```",
