                        "content": "Let's analyze each section step by step:\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n- Find the relevant line items that represent principal revenue-producing activities and other activities:\n  - No direct line item labeled as \"net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities,\" but in balance sheets, cash and cash equivalents are usually included under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" or might be implied under \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits.\"\n- The other two line items requested:\n  1. Taxes accrued but not yet paid: \"Taxes Payable\" (indicates taxes accrued but unpaid).\n  2. Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities: The net profit or net income, which is the ultimate income from normal operations. Although net profit appears on the income statement, since the balance sheet shows retained earnings and profit, the income is directly tied to the net income figure.\n\n**From the balance sheet:**\n- Cash and cash equivalents (End_amount): Usually \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" is not explicitly listed in the balance sheet, but \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" are described:\n  - Sum: 4540900.90 + 2866063.83 = 7,006,964.73 approximately.\n- Taxes payable: 253,246.99.\n- Total income arising in the course of the entity’s ordinary activities: The net income for the period, which from the income statement is \"Net Profit.\" For the latest period, \"Net Profit\" = 707,199.17.\n\n**Cash Flow Statement:**\n- The cash flow from operating activities is given directly; for the latest data, it is -64099.10.\n- The \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" is directly provided.\n\n**Income Statement:**\n- The total income arising during the course of the entity's ordinary activities is \"Net Profit\": 707,199.17 (for the latest period).\n\n---\n\n**Final extracted values:**\n1. The net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities that are principal revenue-producing activities is commonly the cash flow from operating activities, which is -64099.10.\n2. Taxes accrued but not yet paid: 253,246.99.\n3. Total income from ordinary activities (net profit): 707,199.17.\n\n---\n\n**Solution in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '64099.10', 'value2': '253246.99', 'value3': '707199.17'} }\n```",
