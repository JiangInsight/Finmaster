The amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit are typically reflected in \"Accounts Receivable\".\n2. The amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit are typically shown under \"Accounts Payable\".\n\nFrom the provided data:\n\n- \"Accounts Receivable\" initial value: 0.00, final value: 1,851,327.29\n- \"Accounts Payable\" initial value: 0.00, final value: 1,240,000.00\n\nThese are the key line items representing credit receivables and payables.\n\nFinal answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '0.00', 'end valu1': '1851327.29', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '1240000.00'} }\n```",
