Typically, these are classified as \"Fixed Assets\" or \"Property, Plant, and Equipment\" in a balance sheet.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Look for line items related to tangible assets held for operational purposes.\n2. The \"Fixed Assets\" line item represents tangible assets used in operations.\n3. The initial value of \"Fixed Assets\" is 5,000,000.00.\n4. The end value of \"Fixed Assets\" is 5,528,936.17.\n\nThese values reflect the initial and final amounts of tangible assets used for the company's operational needs, including any acquisitions or disposals during the period.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5528936.17'}}\n```",
