Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers:  \n   This typically corresponds to *Selling Expenses* or similar (costs directly related to fulfillment and sales).\n\n2. Financing costs incurred by the enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation:  \n   Usually represented by *Financial Expenses*.\n\n3. The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life:  \n   Known as *Depreciation*.\n\n4. The total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period:  \n   Known as *Tax Expense*.\n\nNow, looking at the data:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n|---|---|---|\n| Selling Expenses | 855800.20 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Financial Expenses | 226258.90 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Depreciation | 45749.47 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Tax Expense | 253246.99 | 2024-01-29 |\n\nMatching these to the required line items:\n\n- Cost of securing and delivering customer orders: **Selling Expenses** = 855800.20\n- Financing costs: **Financial Expenses** = 226258.90\n- Systematic allocation of depreciation: **Depreciation** = 45749.47\n- Total taxes during the period: **Tax Expense** = 253246.99\n\nFinal answer in the specified format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '855800.20', 'value2': '226258.90', 'value3': '45749.47', 'value4': '253246.99'}}\n```",
