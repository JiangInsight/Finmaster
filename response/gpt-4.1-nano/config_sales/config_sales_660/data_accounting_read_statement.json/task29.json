Typically, total income is primarily constituted by \"Main Business Revenue\" (or similar). In this case, \"Main Business Revenue\" is provided.\n\n- So, component sub-item: \"Main Business Revenue\" with value 5,064,939.23.\n\n- Since the total income (Total Revenue) equals Main Business Revenue here, there's no indication of other revenue components in the statement. Thus, the sub-item is the same as the total income.\n\nNow, present the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"5064939.23\", \"sub_item value\": \"5064939.23\"}}\n```",
