Cash held by the entity that is available for use in daily operations and other purposes:\n   - Usually represented by \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits.\"\n   \n2. Tangible items held for use in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes:\n   - Typically referred to as \"Inventory\" and \"Fixed Assets.\"\n   \n3. Amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid, including initial and final values:\n   - Usually shown under \"Taxes Payable.\"\n\nNow, identify the values for each:\n\n- For \"Cash on Hand\":\n  - Initial: 3,000,000.00\n  - Final: 4,540,900.90\n\n- For \"Bank Deposits\":\n  - Initial: 5,000,000.00\n  - Final: 2,866,063.83\n\n- For \"Inventory\" (tangible items for operational or production use):\n  - Initial: 0.00\n  - Final: 450,000.00\n\n- For \"Fixed Assets\" (tangible items used for production or administrative purposes):\n  - Initial: 5,000,000.00\n  - Final: 5,528,936.17\n\n- For \"Taxes Payable\" (taxes accrued but not paid):\n  - Initial: 0.00\n  - Final: 253,246.99\n\nSince the task requires three line items:\n- The Cash items (Cash on Hand and Bank Deposits) are both cash holdings.\n- The relevant tangible items are Inventory and Fixed Assets.\n- The tax amount is \"Taxes Payable.\"\n\nThe answer should include three line items, incorporating the relevant values.\n\nFinal, selecting \"Cash on Hand,\" \"Bank Deposits,\" and \"Taxes Payable\" as the three key line items for the purposes described (cash and taxes), or \"Inventory\" as well for tangible items.\n\nBut based on the instruction and typical classification, the three line items are:\n\n1. Cash on Hand\n2. Bank Deposits\n3. Taxes Payable\n\nHere's the constructed solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"initial value1\": \"3000000.00\",\n    \"end valu1\": \"4540900.90\",\n    \"initial value2\": \"5000000.00\",\n    \"end valu2\": \"2866063.83\",\n    \"initial value3\": \"0.00\",\n    \"end valu3\": \"253246.99\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis maintains the original order and selects the relevant cash and tax items as specified.",
