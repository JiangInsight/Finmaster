The total amount of liabilities and equity (\"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\") is given in the balance sheet. \n   - Initial value: 13,000,000.00\n   - End value: 15,200,446.16\n\n2. The two components that sum into this total usually are:\n   - Total Liabilities\n   - Total Owner's Equity\n\n3. From the given data:\n   - Total Owner's Equity:\n     - Initial: 13,000,000.00\n     - End: 13,707,199.17\n   - Total Current Liabilities (a part of liabilities):\n     - Initial: 0.00\n     - End: 1,243,246.99\n   - Total Liabilities (which includes both current and non-current liabilities):\n     - Initial: 0.00\n     - End: 1,243,246.99\n\n   Since total liabilities aren't explicitly broken into current/non-current, but \"Total Current Liabilities\" is given, and the non-current liabilities can be inferred as the difference between total liabilities and current liabilities.\n\n4. To decompose liabilities further, check if \"Total Non-current Liabilities\" is listed, but it is not. Instead, for simplicity and based on common practice, the total liabilities can be considered as the sum of \"Total Current Liabilities\" (given) and other liabilities which might be zero or not separately listed here.\n\n   In this case, it appears the total liabilities are equivalent to \"Total Current Liabilities\" since no other liabilities are explicitly given.\n\n5. Therefore:\n   - Initial total liabilities: 0.00\n   - End total liabilities: 1,243,246.99\n\n6. The total liabilities and equity sums are:\n\n   Initial: 13,000,000.00\n   \n   End: 15,200,446.16\n\n7. The decomposition:\n   - Initial liabilities: 0.00\n   - Final liabilities: 1,243,246.99\n   - Initial owner's equity: 13,000,000.00\n   - Final owner's equity: 13,707,199.17\n\n**Final step: Prepare the JSON output following the specified format.**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"initial value\": \"13000000.00\",\n  \"end value\": \"15200446.16\",\n  \"sub_items_initial sub_item value1\": \"0.00\",\n  \"sub_items_end sub_item value1\": \"1243246.99\",\n  \"sub_items_initial sub_item value2\": \"13000000.00\",\n  \"sub_items_end sub_item value2\": \"13707199.17\"\n}}\n```",
