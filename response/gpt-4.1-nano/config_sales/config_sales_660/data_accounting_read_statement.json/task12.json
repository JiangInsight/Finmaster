Initial total current assets: 8,000,000.00\n2. End total current assets: 9,717,259.46\n3. Items contributing to current assets include:\n   - Cash on Hand\n   - Bank Deposits\n   - Interest Receivable\n   - Accounts Receivable\n   - Inventory\n\n4. Since total assets include both current and non-current assets, but the question emphasizes assets expected for sale or consumption within the operating cycle, we focus on current assets.\n\n5. Initial value of current assets = 8,000,000.00  \n   Final value of current assets = 9,717,259.46\n\nThese values represent the initial and final amount of assets expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption.\n\nAnswer in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '9717259.46'}}\n```",
