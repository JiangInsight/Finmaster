Commonly, these assets appear under categories such as \"Assets Held for Sale,\" \"Assets in the process of sale,\" or similar. \n\nIn this given balance sheet, the relevant line item is likely \"Inventory,\" especially since inventory can include assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business or under process of sale.\n\nNow, check the provided data:\n\n- Initial Inventory: 0.00\n- End Inventory: 450,000.00\n\nSince inventory can include assets held for sale, the change here suggests that inventory now includes assets that are ready or in the process of being sold.\n\nTherefore, the assets held for sale are reflected under the \"Inventory\" line item, with a final (end) value of 450,000.00.\n\nThe initial value of inventory was zero, indicating these assets may have been acquired or reclassified recently as assets held for sale or in the process of sale.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '450000.00'}}\n```",
