Identify the \"Tax\" line item in the income statement:\n   - The income statement shows \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of **253246.99**.\n\n2. Confirm the context:\n   - The problem asks for the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay or recover during the reporting period.\n   - The relevant line item is \"Tax Expense,\" which indicates the expected tax payable or recoverable for the period.\n\n3. Verify consistency:\n   - Both examples and other sections confirm that \"Tax Expense\" corresponds to the tax amount payable or recoverable, and is typically reported as \"Tax Expense\" or similar in income statements.\n\n**Therefore, the total tax amount expected to pay or recover during the period is 253,246.99.**\n\n---\n\n**Final answer in the required format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '253246.99'} }\n```",
