The task is to identify and extract the line item referring to interest accrued but not yet received, including its initial and final values, from the given financial statements.\n\n2. In typical financial statements, interest accrued but not yet received is usually recorded under:\n   - \"Interest Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet (assets section).\n\n3. From the balance sheet data:\n   - Initial amount of Interest Receivable at 2023-12-31: 0.00\n   - End amount of Interest Receivable at 2024-01-29: 8967.44\n\n4. Since the initial value is zero, and the final value is 8967.44, the change over this period represents interest accrued but not yet received at the end of the period.\n\n5. The net change in \"Interest Receivable\" is the interest accrued but not yet received during this period.\n\n6. The relevant line items:\n   - Initial value: 0.00\n   - End value: 8967.44\n\nTherefore, the extracted interest accrued but not yet received is represented by:\n\n{\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"8967.44\"}\n\nNow, reflecting this reasoning in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"8967.44\"}}\n```",
