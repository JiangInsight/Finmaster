This increase is reflected as a positive amount in the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" line.\n\nLet's analyze the data:\n\n- \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is 1,240,000.00. Since it is positive, it indicates an increase in the amount owed, representing new credit purchases during the period.\n\nGiven this, the specific line item of interest is \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with the value of 1,240,000.00.\n\nNow, formatting the answer accordingly:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1240000.00'} }\n```",
