There is no direct line item indicating sale or reduction of assets held for sale, in production, or under manufacturing.\n\n**Key insight:**  \n- The problem asks for the **reduction in assets held for sale**.  \n- The common indicator here could be a **sale of assets or decrease in assets held for sale** shown as cash inflow or outflow.\n\nSince no specific line item explicitly mentions the reduction of assets held for sale, and given the data, the best matching item related to asset reduction is **not explicitly present**.\n\nTherefore, based on this cash flow statement, **there is no identifiable line item and corresponding value indicating a reduction in assets held for sale** in the given period.\n\n**Final answer:**  \n- No line item reflecting the reduction is provided, so the value should be null or omitted.\n\n**Answer in the required format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': null}}\n```",
