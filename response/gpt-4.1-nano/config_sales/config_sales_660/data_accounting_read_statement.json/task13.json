                        "content": "To identify the non-current assets that are not expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle, I need to analyze the \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line items. These typically represent items such as property, plant, and equipment, which are long-term assets not held primarily for sale.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. **Fixed Assets**: This line item indicates the initial and end values of long-term tangible assets used in operations.\n2. **Accumulated Depreciation**: This reduces the book value of fixed assets over time; for the purpose of this task, it is relevant because it directly relates to fixed assets and indicates their used or consumed status.\n3. **Total Non-current Assets**: This is the net of gross fixed assets and accumulated depreciation, representing the book value of long-term assets.\n\nThe instruction focuses on assets *not expected to be realized or intended for sale* â€” which characteristically include fixed assets, not current assets like cash or receivables.\n\nThus:\n- Initial value of fixed assets: 5,000,000.00\n- End value of fixed assets: 5,528,936.17\n\nFinal value of fixed assets after depreciation is already netted and given as \"Total Non-current Assets,\" but the task asks specifically for the original fixed assets and their net book value.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5483186.70'} }\n```",
