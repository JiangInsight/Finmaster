Review the provided balance sheet data.\n2. Identify all liabilities that are payable within the normal operating cycle. Usually, these are the current liabilities.\n3. The relevant line items for settlement are:\n   - Accounts Payable\n   - Taxes Payable\n4. Sum the initial and final amounts of these liabilities.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Initial amount of Accounts Payable: 0.00\n- Final amount of Accounts Payable: 1,240,000.00\n- Initial amount of Taxes Payable: 0.00\n- Final amount of Taxes Payable: 253,246.99\n\nSum of initial liabilities expected to be settled:\n0.00 + 0.00 = 0.00\n\nSum of final liabilities expected to be settled:\n1,240,000.00 + 253,246.99 = 1,493,246.99\n\nFinal total liabilities expected to be settled in the normal course of the operating cycle:\n**1,493,246.99**\n\nAnswer in the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1493246.99'}}\n```",
