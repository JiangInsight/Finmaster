Typically, such items are classified as \"Accounts Receivable\" or similar receivable accounts on the balance sheet.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Look for accounts related to receivables, which indicate amounts owed to the entity due for sales or services on credit.\n2. Within the provided table, the account named \"Accounts Receivable\" fits this description.\n3. The initial value for \"Accounts Receivable\" is 0.00.\n4. The end value for \"Accounts Receivable\" is 1,851,327.29.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item tracking amounts owed to the entity for credit sales is \"Accounts Receivable\" with an initial amount of 0.00 and a final amount of 1,851,327.29.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1851327.29'}}\n```",
