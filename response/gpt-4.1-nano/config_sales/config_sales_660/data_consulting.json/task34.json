To match example formatting, keep to two decimal places.\n\n**Step 2: Debt to Equity Ratio**\n\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities + Non-current Liabilities (not explicitly given but can be inferred: since total liabilities = total assets - total equity)\n- Total Assets = 15,200,446.16\n- Total Owner's Equity = 13,707,199.17\n- Total Liabilities = 15,200,446.16 - 13,707,199.17 = 1,493,246.99 (matching current liabilities, indicating no other liabilities)\n\nDebt to Equity:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} = \\frac{1,493,246.99}{13,707,199.17} \\approx 0.109 \\text{ or } 0.11\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Total Asset Turnover Ratio**\n\n- Total Revenue = 5,064,939.23\n- Total Assets = 15,200,446.16\n\nAsset Turnover:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{5,064,939.23}{15,200,446.16} \\approx 0.333\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Quick Ratio**\n\nQuick Assets = Cash + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable\n= 4,540,900.90 + 1,851,327.29 + 8,967.44 = 6,401,195.63\n\nCurrent Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n\nQuick Ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{6,401,195.63}{1,493,246.99} \\approx 4.29\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Operating Cash Flow Ratio**\n\n- Operating Cash Flow: -64,099.10 (same as step 1)\n- Current Liabilities: 1,493,246.99\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\approx -0.043\n\\]\n\n(Identical to step 1)\n\n**Step 6: Return on Equity (ROE)**\n\n- Net Profit: 707,199.17\n- Average Equity = (Beginning Equity + Ending Equity)/2\n  = (13,700,000 + 13,707,199.17)/2 = 13,703,599.59\n\nROE:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Equity}} = \\frac{707,199.17}{13,703,599.59} \\approx 0.0516 \\text{ or } 5.16\\%\n\\]\n\n**Step 7: Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio**\n\n- Revenue: 5,064,939.23\n- Accounts Receivable at end: 1,851,327.29\n\nAssumption: Use period (approx 1 month). Usually, AR turnover uses average AR. Since initial AR = 0, we can approximate average AR = 0 + 1,851,327.29 / 2 = 925,663.64\n\nBut more accurately, because initial AR is zero and final is 1,851,327.29, approximate average AR = (0 + 1,851,327.29)/2 = 925,663.64\n\nAR Turnover Ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} = \\frac{5,064,939.23}{925,663.64} \\approx 5.47\n\\]\n\nAlternatively, if we simply use ending AR (since initial was zero and the period is one month), the ratio is 5.47.\n\n---\n\n### Final answers in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.04\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\", \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.33\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"4.29\", \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.04\", \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"5.16%\", \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"5.47\"}}\n```\n\n**Note:** The ratios are rounded to two decimal places where appropriate.",
