                        "content": "Let's proceed step-by-step to calculate the Quick Ratio and the Net Profit Margin.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the necessary data\n\n**For Quick Ratio:**\n- Quick assets typically include Cash, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, Accounts Receivable.\n- Exclude Inventory and Fixed Assets.\n\n**For Net Profit Margin:**\n- Use Net Profit from the income statement.\n- Use Total Revenue from the income statement.\n\n### Step 2: Extract data from the problem\n\n**From balance sheet:**\n\n| Account | End_amount | \n| --- | --- | \n| Cash on Hand | 4,540,900.90 |\n| Bank Deposits | 2,866,063.83 |\n| Interest Receivable | 8,967.44 |\n| Accounts Receivable | 1,851,327.29 |\n\nTotal Quick Assets = Sum of above\n\n**Total Quick Assets = 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 + 8,967.44 + 1,851,327.29**\n\nCalculations:\n\n- 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 = 7,406,964.73\n- 7,406,964.73 + 8,967.44 = 7,415,932.17\n- 7,415,932.17 + 1,851,327.29 = 9,267,259.46\n\n**Total Quick Assets = 9,267,259.46**\n\nTotal Current Assets = 9,717,259.46 (from balance sheet), so the Quick Ratio is: \n\nQuick Ratio = Quick Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nLiabilities:\n\n| Account | End_amount |\n| --- | --- |\n| Accounts Payable | 1,240,000.00 |\n| Taxes Payable | 253,246.99 |\n\nTotal Current Liabilities = 1,240,000 + 253,246.99 = 1,493,246.99\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Quick Ratio\n\nQuick Ratio = 9,267,259.46 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.21\n\n**Note:** The provided example solution used 1.54, but based on calculations here, the actual ratio is approximately 6.21.\n\n---\n\n**Now, for the Net Profit Margin:**\n\nFrom the income statement:\n\n- Net Profit = 707,199.17\n- Total Revenue = 5,064,939.23\n\nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\n= (707,199.17 / 5,064,939.23) * 100 ≈ 13.97%\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Quick Ratio\": \"6.21\", \"Net Profit Margin\": \"13.97%\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The calculations are based solely on the provided data, and rounding has been applied to two decimal places for clarity.",
