Since only current liabilities are given, and no long-term debt data, we consider total liabilities as current liabilities:\n  - Total Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt\n- Because Net Cash Flow is negative, the ratio will be negative, indicating cash outflow relative to debt.\n\nCalculating:\nRatio = -64,099.10 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ -0.0429\n\nExpressed as a ratio or percentage, approximately -4.29%. \n\n### Final answers:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Gross Profit Margin\": \"45.99%\", \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-4.29\"}}\n```\nThis ratio indicates the company's cash flow efficiency relative to its current liabilities.",
