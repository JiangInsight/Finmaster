                        "content": "To calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio, we need two main components:\n\n1. **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**\n2. **Total Debt (Liabilities)**\n\n**Step 1: Determine Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -64,099.10\n\n**Step 2: Determine Total Debt**\n\nTotal debt typically includes current liabilities and long-term liabilities. From the balance sheet:\n\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n- The balance sheet does not explicitly specify long-term liabilities, but since Total Liabilities are implied as Total Assets minus Owner's Equity:\n\nTotal Assets = 15,200,446.16  \nOwner's Equity = 13,707,199.17\n\nTotal Liabilities = Total Assets - Owner's Equity  \n= 15,200,446.16 - 13,707,199.17  \n= **1,493,246.99**\n\nThis matches the Total Current Liabilities, indicating no additional non-current liabilities are reported separately. Therefore, Total Debt = 1,493,246.99\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{-64,099.10}{1,493,246.99} \\approx -0.043\n\\]\n\nExpressed as a percentage: approximately -4.3%. But as per the example, we are presenting it as a ratio.\n\n**Final answer in required format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.043\"}}\n```",
