Debt to Asset Ratio**\n\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities + Total Non-current Liabilities\n  - Total Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n  - Total Liabilities (assumed to be total liabilities including payables and taxes payable) = 1,493,246.99 (current liabilities) + taxes payable (not explicitly labeled as liabilities, but taxes payable are liabilities) = 253,246.99\n  - Total Liabilities = 1,493,246.99 + 253,246.99 = 1,746,493.98 (Assuming total liabilities sum up to current liabilities + taxes payable)\n  \n- Total Assets = 15,200,446.16\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets = 1,746,493.98 / 15,200,446.16 ≈ 0.115 (or 11.5%)\n\n**2. Gross Profit Margin**\n\n- Gross Profit = 2,329,939.23\n- Total Revenue = 5,064,939.23\n\n- Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Total Revenue = 2,329,939.23 / 5,064,939.23 ≈ 0.4599 (or 45.99%)\n\n**3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio**\n\n- Operating Cash Flow from Cash Flow Statement = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -64,099.10\n\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flows / Total Liabilities \n  = -64,099.10 / 1,746,493.98 ≈ -0.0367 (or -3.67%)\n\nNow, formatting the answers:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"11.50%\",\n    \"Gross Profit Margin\": \"45.99%\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-3.67\"\n  }\n}\n```",
