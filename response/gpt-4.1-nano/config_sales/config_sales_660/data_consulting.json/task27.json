                        "content": "Let's analyze each ratio step by step:\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n- From the cash flow statement, Net Profit = 707,199.17\n- Operating Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -64,099.10\n- Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Net Income\n\nSince Net Income is positive, but Operating Cash Flow is negative, this will result in a negative ratio.\n\nCalculation:\n- Operating Cash Flow / Net Income = -64,099.10 / 707,199.17 ≈ -0.0907\n- Expressed in ratio form with two decimal places: approximately -0.09\n\n### 2. Turnover Ratio (Current Assets Turnover Ratio)\n- Total Revenue = 5,064,939.23\n- Average current assets = (Beginning + End) / 2\n  - Beginning current assets = 8,000,000.00\n  - End current assets = 9,717,259.46\n  - Average current assets = (8,000,000 + 9,717,259.46) / 2 = 8,858,629.73\n\n- Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Current Assets\n- Calculation:\n  = 5,064,939.23 / 8,858,629.73 ≈ 0.572\n\nExpressed to two decimal places: approximately 0.57\n\n### 3. Quick Ratio\n- Quick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n  - Cash on Hand = 4,540,900.90\n  - Bank Deposits = 2,866,063.83\n  - Interest Receivable = 8,967.44\n  - Accounts Receivable = 1,851,327.29\n- Sum: 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 + 8,967.44 + 1,851,327.29 = 9,267,259.50\n\n- Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable\n  - Accounts Payable = 1,240,000.00\n  - Taxes Payable = 253,246.99\n  - Sum: 1,493,246.99\n\n- Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities\n- Calculation:\n  = 9,267,259.50 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.21\n\nNow, formatting all results:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-0.09\", \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.57\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"6.21\"}}\n```\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-0.09\", \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.57\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"6.21\"}}\n```",
