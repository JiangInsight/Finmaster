                        "content": "Let's analyze the data step by step to compute each ratio.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\n**Data:**  \nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -64,009.10  \nCurrent Liabilities (End of period):  \n- Accounts Payable = 1,240,000  \n- Taxes Payable = 253,247  \nTotal Current Liabilities = 1,493,247\n\n**Calculation:**  \n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -64,009.10 / 1,493,247 ≈ -0.0429\n\n---\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Assumption:**  \n'Debt' here refers to total short-term liabilities (current liabilities).\n\n**Formula:**  \nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities / Total Short-term Debt\n\n**Data:**  \nSame as above, numerator: -64,009.10  \nDebt (Total Current Liabilities) = 1,493,247\n\n**Calculation:**  \n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -64,009.10 / 1,493,247 ≈ -0.0429\n\n---\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\n**Data:**  \nCost of Goods Sold = 2,735,000  \nInitial Inventory (2023-12-31) = 0  \nEnd Inventory (2024-01-29) = 450,000\n\n**Average Inventory:**  \n= (0 + 450,000) / 2 = 225,000\n\n**Calculation:**  \n= 2,735,000 / 225,000 ≈ 12.16\n\n---\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Shareholders' Equity\n\n**Data:**  \nTotal Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities + Non-current Liabilities  \n- Current Liabilities = 1,493,249 (from above)  \n- No info on non-current liabilities explicitly, but assuming total liabilities are same as current liabilities (since no other info) or total liabilities equal Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity.\n\nAlternatively, we can use Total Liabilities = Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity - Paid-in Capital and Retained Earnings.  \nFrom balance sheet, Total Liabilities + Owner’s Equity = Total Assets\n\nTotal Assets = 15,200,446.16  \nOwner's Equity = 13,707,199.17\n\n**Liabilities:**  \n= Total Assets - Owner's Equity = 15,200,446.16 - 13,707,199.17 ≈ 1,493,247\n\nThis matches the sum of current liabilities — so total liabilities ≈ 1,493,247\n\n**Equity:**  \nOwner's Equity = 13,707,199.17\n\n**Calculation:**  \n= 1,493,247 / 13,707,199.17 ≈ 0.109\n\n---\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nQuick Ratio = (Cash + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n\n**Data:**  \nCash on Hand (end): 4,540,900.90  \nAccounts Receivable: 1,851,327.29  \nInterest Receivable: 8,967.44  \nSum: 4,540,900.90 + 1,851,327.29 + 8,967.44 = 6,401,195.07\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 1,493,247\n\n**Calculation:**  \nQuick Ratio = 6,401,195.07 / 1,493,247 ≈ 4.28\n\n---\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nCurrent Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\n**Data:**  \nTotal Current Assets = 9,717,259.46  \nTotal Current Liabilities = 1,493,247\n\n**Calculation:**  \n= 9,717,259.46 / 1,493,247 ≈ 6.51\n\n---\n\n## Final answers:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.04\",\n  \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.04\",\n  \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"12.16\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.11\",\n  \"Quick Ratio\": \"4.28\",\n  \"Current Ratio\": \"6.51\"\n}}\n```",
