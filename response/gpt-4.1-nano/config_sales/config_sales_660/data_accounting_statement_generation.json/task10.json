                        "content": "Let's analyze the transaction data step by step to determine the total non-current assets before and after all transactions.\n\nStep 1: Identify all initial non-current assets (at the starting point)\n\nFrom the data, the initial non-current assets are:\n\n- \"Fixed Assets\" recorded on 2023-12-31 with amount 5,000,000.00\n- \"Storage Facilities\" (asset_type) recorded on 2023-12-31 with amount 305,354.43\n- \"Storage Facilities4\" purchased on 2023-12-31 with amount 305,354.43\n- \"Storage Facilities5\" purchased on 2023-12-31 with amount 171,448.09\n- \"Storage Facilities6\" purchased on 2023-12-31 with amount 92277.65\n- \"Storage Facilities7\" purchased on 2023-12-31 with amount 191303.24\n- \"Production Line4\" purchased on 2023-12-31 with amount 73907.19\n- \"Production Line5\" purchased on 2023-12-31 with amount 191303.24\n- \"Production Line6\" purchased on 2023-12-31 with amount 92277.65\n- \"Production Line7\" purchased on 2023-12-31 with amount 191303.24\n\nTotal initial value of non-current assets = sum of all above.\n\nCalculations:\n\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00\n- Storage Facilities: 305,354.43\n- Storage Facilities4: 171,448.09\n- Storage Facilities5: 171,448.09\n- Storage Facilities6: 92,277.65\n- Storage Facilities7: 191,303.24\n- Production Line4: 73,907.19\n- Production Line5: 191,303.24\n- Production Line6: 92,277.65\n- Production Line7: 191,303.24\n\nSum: 5,000,000 + 305,354.43 + 171,448.09 + 171,448.09 + 92,277.65 + 191,303.24 + 73,907.19 + 191,303.24 + 92,277.65 + 191,303.24 = 6,479,323.82\n\nInitial total non-current assets = 6,479,323.82\n\n---\n\nStep 2: Track any acquisitions or disposals of non-current assets during the period.\n\nFrom the data, additional \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" entries:\n\n- 2023-12-31: 305,354.43 (Storage Facilities4)\n- 2023-12-31: 171,448.09 (Storage Facilities5)\n- 2023-12-31: 191,303.24 (Storage Facilities6)\n- 2023-12-31: 73907.19 (Production Line4)\n- 2023-12-31: 191,303.24 (Production Line5)\n- 2023-12-31: 92277.65 (Production Line6)\n- 2023-12-31: 191,303.24 (Production Line7)\n\nAll these seem to be additions (purchases). Summing these:\n\nSum of new assets purchased:\n\n- Storage Facilities4: 305,354.43\n- Storage Facilities5: 171,448.09\n- Storage Facilities6: 191,303.24\n- Production Line4: 73,907.19\n- Production Line5: 191,303.24\n- Production Line6: 92,277.65\n- Production Line7: 191,303.24\n\nSum: 305,354.43 + 171,448.09 + 191,303.24 + 73,907.19 + 191,303.24 + 92,277.65 + 191,303.24 = 1,215,899.84\n\nTotal assets after purchases:\n\nInitial + Purchases: 6,479,323.82 + 1,215,899.84 = 7,695,223.66\n\nStep 3: Check for any disposals or depreciation (which would decrease the asset value)\n\n- Depreciation entries on 2024-01-01 (45751.41), 2024-01-01 (45749.47), etc., indicate depreciation expense, but the total depreciation reduces the net book value of non-current assets, so we subtract depreciation amounts:\n\nSum depreciation entries (on 2024-01-01):\n\n- 45751.41\n- 45749.47\n\nTotal depreciation: 45751.41 + 45749.47 = 91,500.88 (approximate, ignoring small rounding differences)\n\nDepreciation reduces non-current assets' book value.\n\n- Other depreciation entries are on 2024-01-01 and seem to apply to fixed assets.\n\n- For simplicity, we assume total depreciation applied to existing assets is about 91,500.88 up to the end.\n\nRemaining value after depreciation:\n\n7,695,223.66 - 91,500.88 â‰ˆ 7,603,722.78\n\n- No disposal or sale transactions of assets are evident.\n\nStep 4: Final calculation\n\nTotal non-current assets at the end of the period:\n\nInitial assets + Purchases - Depreciation = approximately 7,603,722.78\n\nTo match the level of precision typical in financial statements, round to two decimals.\n\nFinal assets: 7,603,722.78\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Initial non-current assets: 6,479,323.82\n- Final non-current assets: approximately 7,603,722.78\n\n---\n\n**Answer in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"6,479,323.82\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"7,603,722.78\"}}\n```",
