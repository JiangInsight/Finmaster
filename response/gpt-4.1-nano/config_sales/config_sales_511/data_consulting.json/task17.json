So, we proceed with total liabilities = 728,279.50.)\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting:\n\\[\n\\frac{-81,548.37}{728,279.50} \\approx -0.1121\n\\]\n\nExpressed as a percentage:\n\\[\n-0.1121 \\times 100 \\approx -11.21\\%\n\\]\n\nHowever, since the problem's example solution appears in a decimal form with two decimal places, the ratio approximately is **-0.11**.\n\n### Final answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.11\"}}\n```",
