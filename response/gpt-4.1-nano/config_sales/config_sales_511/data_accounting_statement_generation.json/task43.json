Specifically, we look at cash received from customers (sales), cash paid to suppliers and for operating expenses, and cash paid or received in interest and taxes.\n\nStep 1: Identify cash inflows from operating activities (cash received from customers)\n\n- Sales (Paid): Sum of all sales with status \"Paid\"\n- Unpaid sales are not included because they are receivables, not cash received yet\n- Interest receivables are unpaid, so they are not cash inflows until received\n\nStep 2: Identify cash outflows for operating activities\n\n- Operating expenses paid in cash\n- Financial expenses paid in cash\n- Administrative expenses paid in cash\n- Sales expenses paid in cash\n- Other expenses (if any paid in cash)\n- Interest receivables are unpaid, so not cash outflows\n   \nStep 3: Sum all relevant cash inflows and outflows to compute net cash flow\n\nLet's sum up the key cash inflow items:\n\n**Cash inflows**:\n- Sum of all *Paid* sales in cash\n- Sum of all *Paid* expenses in cash (administrative, sales, financial, other)\n- Summing all cash inflows from sales, which are marked \"Paid\"\n\n**Cash outflows**:\n- Sum of all *Paid* expenses in cash (administrative, sales, financial, other)\n\nNote: We exclude any cash receipts from unpaid sales, receivables, or unpaid interest receivables until payment is received.
