There are various purchases and asset additions, but these are not equity contributionsâ€”they are asset exchanges or expenses.\n\nTherefore, assuming no further contributions or withdrawal of capital occur, the paid-in capital remains the same as initial.\n\n**Step 3: Confirming the result**\n\nNo other entries explicitly show an increase or decrease in paid-in capital.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Initial paid-in capital: sum of initial deposits and contributions = 13,000,000\n- Final paid-in capital: remains the same, as no evidence of additional contributions or withdrawals\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
