These would impact cash balances but the task is to determine the starting balance in the cash flow statement, which is the opening balance, before any transactions.\n\nThe initial amount of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the reporting period is 8,000,000.\n\n**Answer:** 8,000,000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Beginning Balance\": \"8000000.00\"}}\n```",
