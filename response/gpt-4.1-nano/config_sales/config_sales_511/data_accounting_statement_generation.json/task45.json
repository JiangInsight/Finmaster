                        "content": "Let's analyze the transactions to calculate the net cash flows from investing activities.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all investing activities**\n\nInvesting activities typically include:\n- Purchase of fixed assets or other long-term assets (cash outflows)\n- Sale or disposal of fixed assets or other long-term assets (cash inflows)\n\n**Step 2: Extract fixed asset purchase and sale transactions**\n\nFrom the second dataset:\n\n**Fixed Assets Purchases (cash outflows):**\n- 2023-12-31: 305354.43 (Bank Transfer)\n- 2023-12-31: 171985.91 (Bank Transfer)\n- 2023-12-31: 117840.57 (Bank Transfer)\n- 2023-12-31: 73932.79 (Bank Transfer)\n\n_Total Fixed Assets Purchase Outflow:_\n- 305354.43 + 171985.91 + 117840.57 + 73932.79 = 668113.7\n\n**Fixed Assets Purchase (cash outflow):**\n- 2023-12-31: 60000.0 (Cash)\n- 2023-12-31: 25000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n- 2023-12-31: 25000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n- 2023-12-31: 60000.0 (Cash)\n- 2023-12-31: 73932.79 (Bank Transfer) (duplicate fixed asset purchase?)\n\nWait, multiple entries for fixed assets are present, but these seem to represent different fixed assets purchased on the same date. The total sum of these fixed asset purchases is:\n\n- 255,877.41 (from above) + 200,000.0 + 100,000.0 + 60000.0 + 25000.0 + 25000.0 + 60000.0 + 73932.79, but need to confirm the exact transactions.\n\nPowerful approach:\n\n**Fixed Assets Purchases total:**\n- 305354.43\n- 171985.91\n- 117840.57\n- 73932.79\n- 60000.0\n- 25000.0\n- 25000.0\n- 60000.0\n- 73932.79 (duplicate fixed asset purchase, same as previously listed? Possibly, but as per data, the last batch seems separate, so total fixed assets purchased sum is:\n\nTotal fixed assets expenses (cash outflows):\n= 305354.43 + 171985.91 + 117840.57 + 73932.79 + 60000.0 + 25000.0 + 25000.0 + 60000.0 + 73932.79\n= sum these up:\n\n305354.43\n+ 171985.91 = 477340.34\n+ 117840.57 = 595180.91\n+ 73932.79 = 669113.7\n+ 60000.0 = 729113.7\n+ 25000.0 = 754113.7\n+ 25000.0 = 779113.7\n+ 60000.0 = 839113.7\n+ 73932.79 = 913046.49\n\nTotal cash outflows for fixed assets = **913,046.49**\n\n---\n\n**Sale or Disposal of Fixed assets:**\n\nChecking for any disposal of fixed assets:\n\n- 2023-12-31: 305354.43 (Bank Transfer) -- appears to be a purchase, not sale\n- 2023-12-31: 171985.91 (Bank Transfer) -- purchase\n- 2023-12-31: 117840.57 (Bank Transfer)\n- 2023-12-31: 73932.79 (Bank Transfer)\n\nNo sales of assets (cash inflows from sale of assets) are explicitly listed. So, the only relevant cash flows for investing activities are the fixed assets purchase expenses.\n\n**Step 3: Summing all purchase-related cash outflows**\n\nOnly cash outflows for fixed asset purchases are relevant:\n- Total outflow: **-913,046.49**\n\n**Step 4: Final net cash flow from investing activities**\n\nSince there are no sales or proceeds from fixed assets:\n\n**Net cash flow from investing activities = sum of sale proceeds - sum of purchase payments**\n\n= 0 (no asset sales) - 913,046.49 (total purchase payments) = **-913,046.49**\n\n**Note:** As per the initial example, the provided answer was: '-305354.43', but that corresponds only to a subset of the asset purchase. Based on the entire data, the total fixed asset purchase outflows are higher, summing to 913,046.49.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe total cash flows from investing activities are negative, representing cash spent on acquiring long-term assets.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-913046.49'} }\n```",
