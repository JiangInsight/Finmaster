From the first dataset, we have:\n\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000\n\nTotal initial owners' equity:\n\n```\nInitial cash + bank deposit + fixed assets\n= 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000\n= 13,000,000\n```\n\n**Initial Owners' Equity = 13,000,000**\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the final owners' equity**\n\n- Start with initial equity (1,3000,000).\n- Add net income over the period: total revenues minus total expenses.\n- Include investments and withdrawals if any.\n\n**Total Revenue:**\n\nSumming all sales (paid + unpaid):\n\n- Sale on 2024-01-02: 36,215.84\n- Sale on 2024-01-02: 59,124.48\n- Sale on 2024-01-02: 19,969.83\n- Sale on 2024-01-02: 72,765.04\n- Sale on 2024-01-03: 34,946.56\n- Sale on 2024-01-03: 109,147.29\n- Sale on 2024-01-04: 34,944.94\n- Sale on 2024-01-04: 35,220.92\n- Sale on 2024-01-04: 77,327.76\n- Sale on 2024-01-05: 130,993.41\n- Sale on 2024-01-06: 175,639.68\n- Sale on 2024-01-06: 180,204.56\n- Sale on 2024-01-06: 8,723.75\n- Sale on 2024-01-07: 179,351.74\n- Sale on 2024-01-07: 38,713.30\n- Sale on 2024-01-07: 18,296.79\n- Sale on 2024-01-08: 25,130.62\n- Sale on 2024-01-08: 103,073.34\n- Sale on 2024-01-09: 59,099.85\n- Sale on 2024-01-09: 8,870.11\n- Sale on 2024-01-10: 124,688.16\n- Sale on 2024-01-10: 85,124.14\n- Sale on 2024-01-10: 17,440.81\n- Sale on 2024-01-11: 26,826.50\n- Sale on 2024-01-11: 196,469.06\n- Sale on 2024-01-11: 183,722.86\n- Sale on 2024-01-12: 39,531.9\n- Sale on 2024-01-12: 18,136.94\n- Sale on 2024-01-12: 102,464.10\n- Sale on 2024-01-13: 35,406.18\n- Sale on 2024-01-13: 109,147.29\n- Sale on 2024-01-14: 171,957.0\n- Sale on 2024-01-14: 93,318.97\n- Sale on 2024-01-14: 59318.97\n- Sale on 2024-01-15: 85,787.44\n- Sale on 2024-01-15: 180,059.60\n- Sale on 2024-01-15: 288,034.92\n- Sale on 2024-01-16: 9,991.92\n- Sale on 2024-01-16: 19,331.28\n- Sale on 2024-01-16: 8,723.75\n- Sale on 2024-01-17: 180,62.03\n- Sale on 2024-01-17: 9,051.66\n- Sale on 2024-01-18: 197,627.2\n- Sale on 2024-01-18: 37,388.12\n- Sale on 2024-01-19: 188,177.44\n- Sale on 2024-01-19: 263,727.12\n- Sale on 2024-01-19: 39,034.46\n- Sale on 2024-01-20: 53,687.91\n- Sale on 2024-01-20: 35,219.04\n- Sale on 2024-01-20: 17,810.62\n- Sale on 2024-01-21: 27,826.50\n- Sale on 2024-01-21: 85,459.24\n- Sale on 2024-01-21: 17,812.71\n- Sale on 2024-01-21: 9,229.85\n- Sale on 2024-01-22: 39,531.9\n- Sale on 2024-01-22: 18,136.94\n- Sale on 2024-01-23: 18,437.32\n- Sale on 2024-01-23: 15268.37\n- Sale on 2024-01-24: 171,957.0\n- Sale on 2024-01-24: 97,831.72\n- Sale on 2024-01-24: 176,720.04\n- Sale on 2024-01-25: 39,867.96\n- Sale on 2024-01-25: 28,313.49\n- Sale on 2024-01-25: 29,133.60\n- Sale on 2024-01-26: 26,410.40\n- Sale on 2024-01-26: 289,537.89\n- Sale on 2024-01-26: 97,702.96\n- Sale on 2024-01-27: 120,789.80\n- Sale on 2024-01-27: 9,419.76\n- Sale on 2024-01-27: 18,732.69\n- Sale on 2024-01-28: 12,697.67\n- Sale on 2024-01-28: 113,413.10\n- Sale on 2024-01-28: 56,746.47 (total from last + current;
