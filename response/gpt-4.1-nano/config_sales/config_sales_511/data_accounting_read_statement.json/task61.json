                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided financial statements carefully to identify the two specific line items:\n\n1. Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers.\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify costs to secure and deliver goods/services\n\n- Typically, these are reflected under selling and administrative expenses in the income statement.\n- Costs to secure customer orders are usually part of **Selling Expenses** and/or **Administrative Expenses**.\n- Costs related to delivering goods/services are generally included in **Cost of Goods Sold** and Selling Expenses.\n\n**From the income statement**, the relevant expenses include:\n\n- Selling Expenses\n- Administrative Expenses\n\nIn the given data:\n\n**Income Statement (both periods)** show:\n\n- Selling Expenses: e.g., 493,854.67 (first problem), 662,884.34 (second problem)\n- Administrative Expenses: e.g., 1,425,164.20 (first), 278,023.19 (second)\n\n**Typically**, costs to secure customer orders are considered part of Selling Expenses, while costs to deliver services may incorporate Cost of Goods Sold or parts of Selling Expenses.\n\nBut the problem asks for \"costs incurred to secure customer orders AND to deliver the goods and services,\" which generally suggests overall selling and delivery costsâ€”commonly these are captured under *Selling Expenses*. Cost of Goods Sold relates directly to the production of goods, but some delivery costs might be included in Selling Expenses.\n\nGiven the context, the most appropriate line items are:\n\n- **Selling Expenses** (for costs to secure and deliver orders/services)\n- **Cost of Goods Sold** (for direct production costs related to goods delivery)\n\nHowever, considering the example, the first solution picks Selling Expenses and Purchase of Fixed Assets (which aligns with investments in long-term assets).\n\n### Step 2: Identify cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment, and other long-term assets\n\nIn the cash flow statement:\n\n- Under **Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n  - Purchase of Fixed Assets (e.g., 305,354.43 in the first problem, 676,195.87 in the second)\n\nThis line item clearly indicates cash paid for property, plant, and equipment (PP&E).\n\n---\n\n### Final decision:\n\nBased on the example and typical financial statement line items:\n\n- **Costs to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services**: **Selling Expenses**\n- **Cash payments for property, plant, and equipment/long-term assets**: **Purchase of Fixed Assets**\n\n---\n\n### **Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '493854.67', 'value2': '676195.87'}}\n```\n\nThe values correspond to the relevant line items in the income statement (Selling Expenses) and cash flow statement (Purchase of Fixed Assets).",
