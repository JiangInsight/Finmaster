Look for the account \"Bank Deposits.\"\n2. Record its initial amount (at December 31, 2023): 5,000,000.00\n3. Record its end amount (at January 27, 2024): 2,938,804.13\n\nThe change in these amounts shows the increase or decrease in deposited funds during the period.\n\nFinal answer:\n- Initial value: 5,000,000.00\n- End value: 2,938,804.13\n\nbut the task involves *funds deposited into a bank*, which generally means the initial deposit (funds at the start) and the final deposited funds (funds at the end). Given the data, the account \"Bank Deposits\" and its initial and final values precisely reflect this.\n\nHere's the JSON-formatted answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"5000000.00\", \"end value\": \"2938804.13\"}}\n```",
