Look for the line item that refers to depreciation, which is typically listed as “Depreciation” or similar.\n2. In both given examples and the current problem, this line item directly shows the amount allocated as depreciation expense for the period.\n3. Since this is a standard line item, the value in this row represents the systematic allocation (often called accumulated depreciation if cumulative over periods, but here, since only a single period's expense is shown, we are referring to the current period's depreciation expense).\n\nIn the provided income statement, the line:\n| Depreciation | 45748.43 | 2024-01-27 |\n\nThe value 45748.43 corresponds to the amount of depreciation allocated systematically for that period.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"45748.43\"} }",
