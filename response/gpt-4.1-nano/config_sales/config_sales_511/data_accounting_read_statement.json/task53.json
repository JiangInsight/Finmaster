                        "content": "To find the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, we need to analyze the relevant data, primarily from the income statement and any changes in inventory balances from the balance sheet. \n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the opening and closing inventories:** \n   - From the balance sheet:\n     - Initial (opening) inventory (2023-12-31): 0.00\n     - End (closing) inventory (2024-01-27): 440,000.00\n\n2. **Identify the cost of goods sold (COGS):** \n   - From the income statement:\n     - COGS: 3,020,000.00\n\n3. **Understanding inventory movement:**\n   Since the opening inventory was zero, the inventory sold during the period would be largely associated with the purchases made during the period, which contributed to the COGS.\n\n4. **Calculating the inventory sold:**\n   - Given that opening inventory is zero, and the COGS corresponds to the cost of inventory sold, the carrying amount of inventories sold during the period is the COGS itself, unless there's additional info about inventory write-offs or other factors.\n   \n5. **Assumption:**\n   - The inventory balance increase (from 0 to 440,000.00) reflects purchases or production during the period.\n   - The COGS is the cost associated with the inventories sold during the period.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe \"carrying amount of inventories sold\" is represented by the COGS figure.\n\n**Answer:** 3,020,000.00\n\n---\n\n**Final formatted answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"3020000.00\"}}\n```",
