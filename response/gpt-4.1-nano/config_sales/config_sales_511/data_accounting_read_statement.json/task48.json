The net profit, which is the amount of profit retained after all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization have been deducted from total revenue.\n2. The amount of cash payments made to acquire property, plant, and equipment (PPE) and other long-term assets, which is reflected in the purchase of fixed assets.\n\n---\n\nStep 1: Find Net Profit  \nIn the given data, \"Net Profit\" is explicitly listed as `1095371.35`.  \n\nStep 2: Find the cash paid for PPE and long-term assets  \nThis is usually represented by the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" line item, which in this case is `676195.87`.  \n\n---\n\nFinal step: Output in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1095371.35', 'value2': '676195.87'}}\n```\n\nThis matches the problem requirements:  \n- The first value is the net profit after all expenses.  \n- The second is the cash payments for property, plant, and equipment.\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1095371.35', 'value2': '676195.87'}}\n```",
