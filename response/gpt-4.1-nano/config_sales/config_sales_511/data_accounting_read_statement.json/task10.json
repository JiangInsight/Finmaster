                        "content": "To identify the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares, we need to look at the line item \"Paid-in Capital.\" This account represents the amount contributed by shareholders at the initial issuance of shares (initial value). The \"Paid-in Capital\" usually does not change unless additional share capital is issued or repaid, so the end value can also be referenced from the same line.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n\n- Initial value of Paid-in Capital: 13,000,000.00\n- End value of Paid-in Capital: 13,000,000.00\n\nThis suggests that the shareholders' contributed capital remains the same over the period, with no additional issuance or repayment.\n\nTherefore, the specific line items are \"Paid-in Capital\" with initial and final values both being 13,000,000.00.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
