Line item for amounts owed to the entity for goods/services (credit sales):\n- Look in the balance sheet entries for \"Accounts Receivable.\"\n- End-of-period value: **1502354.84** (from the second table, both in the balance sheet and confirmed in cash flow via \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Receivable\").\n\n### 2. Financing costs:\n- Check the income statement for \"Financial Expenses.\"\n- End value: **432511.69**.\n\n### 3. Cash payments for property, plant, and equipment:\n- In the cash flow statement, under “Purchase of Fixed Assets,” the amount is **676195.87**.\n- This amount reflects cash paid for acquiring long-term assets.\n\n---\n\n**Group the extracted line items:**\n- **Balance Sheet:** Accounts Receivable\n- **Income Statement:** Financial Expenses\n- **Cash Flow Statement:** Purchase of Fixed Assets\n\n---\n\n**Final step:**\nFormat the answer as required.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"1502354.84\", \"value2\": \"432511.69\", \"value3\": \"676195.87\"}}\n```",
