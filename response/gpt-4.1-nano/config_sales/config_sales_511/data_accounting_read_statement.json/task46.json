According to the problem, this involves the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and investments not included in cash equivalents, as well as receipt of interest and dividends.\n\nIn the given data:\n\n- The line \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is blank, but the next line \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" shows an amount, and the subsequent line \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" shows a negative amount. \n- The \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" indicates an outflow related to acquiring long-term assets.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The net amount from investing activities is given explicitly as:\n   - **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities** = -676195.87\n\n2. To decompose this, we need to identify the components that comprise this net cash flow. \n   \n3. Typically, purchasing fixed assets is a major component of investing outflows, which is directly provided: **Purchase of Fixed Assets = 676195.87**.\n\n4. The net cash flow from investing activities (-676195.87) is the only explicit component shown, with no other items (like sale of assets, interest receipts, dividends) listed separately.\n\nConclusion:\n- The main component here is the purchase of fixed assets with a value of 676195.87.\n\nNow, prepare the output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-676195.87\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value\": \"676195.87\"}}}\n```",
