Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities:\n   - This is typically represented by \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue\".\n   \n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period:\n   - Usually indicated by \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n   \n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole:\n   - Usually reflected by \"Administrative Expenses\".\n\nFrom the data provided:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 5565589.48 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Total Revenue | 5565589.48 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 3020000.00 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Total Cost | 3020000.00 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 278023.19 | 2024-01-27 |\n\nSince the problem specifies to maintain the original order, the sequence should be:\n\n1. Total income (arising in ordinary activities): \"Total Revenue\" of 5565589.48\n2. Inventories sold: \"Cost of Goods Sold\" of 3020000.00\n3. General management and administration costs: \"Administrative Expenses\" of 278023.19\n\nNow, formatting the answer accordingly:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5565589.48', 'value2': '3020000.00', 'value3': '278023.19'}}\n```",
