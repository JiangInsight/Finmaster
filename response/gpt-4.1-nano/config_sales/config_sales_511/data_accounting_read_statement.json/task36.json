Identify the key line item representing profit after all expenses: \"Net Profit.\"  \n   In this case, the \"Net Profit\" listed is **1095371.35**.\n\n2. Usually, the \"Net Profit\" already accounts for all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization.\n\n3. Since the instruction asks for the amount of profit retained after all expenses have been deducted, the \"Net Profit\" value is exactly the figure needed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the value of \"Net Profit\" as given.\n\nAnswer:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"1095371.35\"}}",
