The main item of interest is the net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period, which is already given as \"Net Increase\" (or net change). \n   \n2. From the data:\n   - Beginning Balance = 8,000,000.00\n   - Ending Balance = 7,242,255.76\n   - Net Increase = Ending Balance - Beginning Balance = 7,242,255.76 - 8,000,000.00 = -757,744.24 (which matches the provided Net Increase).\n\n3. The value of the net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period is -757,744.24.\n\n4. To decompose this net change into two components, we look at the cash flows from operating and investing activities:\n   - Cash flow from Operating Activities: net cash flow = -81,548.37\n   - Cash flow from Investing Activities: net cash flow = -676,195.87\n\n5. Sum of these components:\n   - -81,548.37 + (-676,195.87) = -757,744.24, which matches the total net change, confirming our decomposition.\n\nFinal outputs:\n- Total net addition: -757,744.24\n- Decomposition:\n  - Component 1 (Operating cash flow): -81,548.37\n  - Component 2 (Investing cash flow): -676,195.87\n\nNow, formatted in the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-757744.24\", \"sub_items_sub_item value1\": \"-81548.37\", \"sub_items_sub_item value2\": \"-676195.87\"}}\n```",
