The key points are:\n\n- Initial value of \"Interest Receivable\" at the start date.\n- End value of \"Interest Receivable\" at the end date.\n- The change in the balance reflects the interest accrued but not yet received during the period.\n\nFrom the provided balance sheet data:\n\nInitial value of Interest Receivable (at 2023-12-31): 0.00  \nEnd value of Interest Receivable (at 2024-01-27): 8592.81\n\nThus, the interest accrued but not yet received over this period is the end balance of 8592.81, since it was zero initially and increased to 8592.81 by the end date.\n\nNow, the initial and final values to report are:\n\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- End value: 8592.81\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"8592.81\"}}\n```",
