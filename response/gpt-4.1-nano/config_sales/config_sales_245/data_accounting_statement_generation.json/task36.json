But in context, probably they are included in revenue when accrued.\n   - Depreciation is a non-cash expense, so to get net profit, it is added back after subtracting other expenses.\n   \n5. **Calculate total revenue and total expenses:**\n   - Sum of all sales (paid + unpaid)\n   - Sum of all expenses, including administrative, sales, financial, and other expenses.\n   - Add back depreciation expense.\n\n6. **Consider unpaid interest receivables:**\n   - Add to total income due to interest receivable.\n\n7. **Calculate net profit:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Profit} = \\text{Total Revenues} + \\text{Interest Receivable} + \\text{Other gains} - \\text{Expenses} - \\text{Interest receivable (if unpaid interest is considered cash, itâ€™s a receivable)} + \\text{Depreciation (non-cash).}\n   \\]\n\n**Performing calculations:**\n\n- Sum all \"Sale\" amounts (both paid and unpaid).\n\n- Sum all expense amounts.\n\n- Sum all interest receivables (interest income), unpaid interest receivables are an income.\n\n- Sum depreciation expenses.\n\n### Summing revenues:\n\nSales (Paid and Unpaid):\n\nLet me extract all \"Sale\" values:\n\n- Sale20240102002: 39170.93 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240102003: 70156.46 (paid)\n- Sale20240103005: 233587.28 (paid)\n- Sale20240103006: 33111.75 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240104007: 289119.85 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240105008: 122727.90 (paid)\n- Sale20240106009: 243947.96 (paid)\n- Sale20240106010: 116591.50 (paid)\n- Sale20240107011: 101795.80 (paid)\n- Sale20240107012: 47084.68 (paid)\n- Sale20240108014: 251306.24 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240108001: 63059.49 (paid)\n- Sale20240108001: 590628.70 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240109032: 19006.32 (paid)\n- Sale20240109033: 27822.78 (paid)\n- Sale20240109034: 19170.40 (paid)\n- Sale20240110016: 124688.16 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240110017: 96447.68 (paid)\n- Sale20240111040: 77774.76 (paid)\n- Sale20240111041: 78657.2 (paid)\n- Sale20240112018: 193782.60 (paid)\n- Sale20240112019: 91284.56 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240113021: 265419.24 (paid)\n- Sale20240113050: 9548.59 (paid)\n- Sale20240114022: 24676.98 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240114023: 317862.15 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240115025: 130993.41 (paid)\n- Sale20240115056: 9327.25 (paid)\n- Sale20240115057: 296895.30 (paid)\n- Sale20240116027: 61926.77 (paid)\n- Sale20240117028: 50583.60 (paid)\n- Sale20240118030: 12697.67 (paid)\n- Sale20240119032: 63059.49 (paid)\n- Sale20240119033: 590628.70 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240119070: 52668.75 (paid)\n- Sale20240119071: 266868.12 (paid)\n- Sale20240120072: 17832.11 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240120073: 17673.74 (paid)\n- Sale20240120074: 177214.12 (paid)\n- Sale20240121035: 402869.40 (paid)\n- Sale20240121076: 9561.13 (paid)\n- Sale20240121077: 51657.21 (paid)\n- Sale20240122036: 67982.82 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240122037: 119369.05 (paid)\n- Sale20240123038: 54818.96 (paid)\n- Sale20240124041: 262602.87 (paid)\n- Sale20240124042: 29895.72 (paid)\n- Sale20240125044: 124952.50 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240125045: 24341.12 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240126047: 168960.87 (paid)\n- Sale20240126100: 103824.27 (paid)\n- Sale20240126101: 27687.18 (paid)\n- Sale20240126102: 27512.10 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240127050: 120789.80 (paid)\n- Sale20240127104: 97119.22 (paid)\n- Sale20240127105: 98243.33 (paid)\n- Sale20240127106: 195738.24 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240128052: 12697.67 (paid)\n- Sale20240128053: 113413.10 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240129054: 35752.38 (paid)\n- Sale20240129055: 231897.32 (paid)\n- Sale20240129070: 52668.75 (paid)\n- Sale20240129071: 266868.12 (paid)\n- Sale20240129113: 259290.33 (paid)\n- Sale20240130056: 128279.1 (paid)\n- Sale20240130057: 74300.25 (paid)\n- Sale20240130058: 16857.72 (unpaid)\n- Sale20240130059: 119280.49 (unpaid)\n\nNow, sum all sales:\n\nPaid Sales:\n- 70156.46\n- 233587.28\n- 122727.90\n- 243947.96\n- 116591.50\n- 101795.80\n- 47084.68\n- 63059.49\n- 19006.32\n- 27822.78\n- 19170.40\n- 96447.68\n- 77774.76\n- 78657.2\n- 193782.60\n- 91284.56\n- 265419.24\n- 9548.59\n- 317862.15\n- 130993.41\n- 9327.25\n- 296895.30\n- 61926.77\n- 50583.60\n- 12697.67\n- 590628.70\n- 52668.75\n- 266868.12\n- 17673.74\n- 177214.12\n- 402869.40\n- 9561.13\n- 51657.21\n- 119369.05\n- 54818.96\n- 262602.87\n- 29895.72\n- 12639.86\n- 231897.32\n- 259290.33\n- 128279.10\n- 74300.25\n- 17832.11\n- 17673.74\n- 177214.12\n- 402869.40\n- 9561.13\n- 51657.21\n- 119369.05\n- 54818.96\n- 262602.87\n- 29895.72\n- 231897.32\n- 259290.33\n\nUnpaid Sales:\n- 39170.93\n- 33111.75\n- 289119.85\n- 116591.50\n- 2024.01.
