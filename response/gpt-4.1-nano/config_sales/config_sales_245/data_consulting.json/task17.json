If we consider only current liabilities as debt for this calculation, then total debt = total current liabilities.\n\n**Total Debt = 1,124,588.25**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Ratio**\n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / (Total Debt)\n\n= 215,423.24 / 1,124,588.25 â‰ˆ 0.1915\n\nExpressed as a ratio or percentage, approximately 0.19.\n\n**Step 4: Format the answer**\n\nTo match the example, round to two decimal places:\n\n- 0.19 or 0.19\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.19'} }\n```",
