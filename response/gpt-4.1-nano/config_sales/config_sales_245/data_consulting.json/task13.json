                        "content": "Let's analyze the data step by step to calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Inventory Turnover Ratio Formula**\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory\n\n**Step 2: Extract Necessary Data**\n\n- COGS is given in the income statement.\n- Average Inventory is calculated as:\n  \n  (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2\n\nWe have the ending inventory values from the balance sheet for the start and end dates.\n\n**Step 3: Retrieve Data from the Provided Data**\n\n*Income Statements:*\n\n- For the first problem:\n  - COGS = 4,410,000.00\n\n- For the second problem:\n  - COGS = 3,250,000.00\n\n*Balance Sheet (Inventory):*\n\n- For the first problem:\n  - End Inventory (2024-01-30): 5,090,000.00\n  - Start Inventory (2023-12-31): 0.00\n\n- For the second problem:\n  - End Inventory (2024-01-29): 975,000.00\n  - Start Inventory (2023-12-31): 0.00\n\nSince Inventory was zero at the start in both cases, the average Inventory equals (0 + ending inventory) / 2 = ending inventory / 2.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Average Inventory**\n\n- First problem: (0 + 5,090,000) / 2 = 2,545,000.00\n- Second problem: (0 + 975,000) / 2 = 487,500.00\n\n**Step 5: Calculate Inventory Turnover Ratio**\n\n- For the first problem:\n  \n  4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73\n\n- For the second problem:\n  \n  3,250,000 / 487,500 ≈ 6.67\n\n**Final step: Present the results as per instruction**\n\nSince the user asked for the calculation based on the provided problem data, I will give the answer for the second problem as per the user's input.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"6.67\"}}\n```\n\n*(Note: If the user wants the ratio for the first problem, it is approximately 1.73. But since the user provided the second problem, I will respond with that calculation.)*",
