                        "content": "Let's go through each ratio step-by-step:\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Given Data:**\n\n- Net Income = 1,163,543.07 (from the income statement)\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 215,423.24 (from the cash flow statement)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{215,423.24}{1,163,543.07} \\approx 0.185 \\text{ or } 18.5\\%\n\\]\n\nHowever, since the problem's example solution shows ratios in a simplified form (possibly multiplied by 100 for percentage), but the example gives \"4.41,\" which suggests it is not in percentage but a ratio.\n\nActually, in the example, the ratio is 4.41, which is roughly 4.4 times.\n\nOur calculation yields roughly 0.185, which suggests that in the example, they used the ratio as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Net Income}}\n\\]\n\nwhich for their data was 4.41, possibly indicating a different scale, but generally, ratios are usually expressed as such.\n\nIn the example, the ratio is greater than 1, indicating cash flows are many times net income, which is common.\n\nOur calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{215,423.24}{1,163,543.07} \\approx 0.185\n\\]\n\nmeaning Operating Cash Flow is about 18.5% of net income.\n\n**Alternatively,** the common practice is to consider cash flow over net income:\n\n- If we flip it (Net Income over Operating Cash Flow) â€” but in the example they calculated Operating Cash Flow to Net Income, so it is Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities divided by Net Income.\n\nThus,\n\n**Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} \\approx 0.185\n\\]\n\nExpressed as string: \"0.19\" (rounded to 2 decimal places).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Turnover Ratio (Current Assets Turnover)\n\n**Given data:**\n\n- Total Revenue = 5,991,764.34\n- Total Current Assets at end date = 10,333,889.03\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}}\n\\]\n\nSince only the end balance is given, and no average, we approximate using the end balance:\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{5,991,764.34}{10,333,889.03} \\approx 0.579\n\\]\n\nRounded to two decimal places: \"0.58\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. Quick Ratio\n\n**Quick Assets:** Cash + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable\n\n**Given data:**\n\n- Cash on Hand: 4,560,423.24\n- Accounts Receivable: 1,133,414.13\n- Interest Receivable: 10,051.66\n\nTotal Quick Assets:\n\n\\[\n4,560,423.24 + 1,133,414.13 + 10,051.66 = 5,703,889.45\n\\]\n\n**Current Liabilities:**\n\n- Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 825,000 + 299,588.25 = 1,124,588.25\n\n**Quick Ratio:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{5,703,889.45}{1,124,588.25} \\approx 5.07\n\\]\n\nExpressed as a rounded number: \"5.07\"\n\n---\n\n## Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"0.19\",\n    \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.58\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"5.07\"\n  }\n}\n```",
