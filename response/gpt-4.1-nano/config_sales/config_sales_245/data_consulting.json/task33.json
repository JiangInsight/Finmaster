                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided data step by step to calculate each of the financial ratios.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\n**Values:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 215,423.24\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{215,423.24}{1,124,588.25} \\approx 0.1914\n\\]\nExpressed as a ratio:\n\\(\\approx 0.19\\)\n\n---\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:**\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n\\]\n*Note:* Since total debt is not explicitly provided, we typically consider total liabilities (current + non-current) as total debt.\n\n**Values:**\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities + Long-term debt (assumed to be fixed assets minus equity-related adjustments). But since long-term debt isn't provided, and current liabilities are present, use total liabilities = 1,124,588.25 + (Total Non-current Liabilities can be interpreted as the difference). \n- For simplicity, the best approach here is to consider total liabilities as given: Total Liabilities on the balance sheet = 1,124,588.25 (current) + other liabilities if any, but only current liabilities are given. \n- Since no other liabilities are specified, assume total debt roughly equals total current liabilities (as the total liabilities including non-current aren't provided).  \n- Alternatively, as total liabilities are not specified separately, use total liabilities as the sum of current liabilities only in this context, which is 1,124,588.25.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{215,423.24}{1,124,588.25} \\approx 0.1914\n\\]\nSame as above, ratio ≈ 0.19.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n\\]\n*Assuming inventory change over the period.*\n\n**Values:**\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 3,250,000.00 (from income statement)\n- Initial Inventory = 975,000.00\n- End Inventory = 975,000.00 (since only one value is given for end-period; initial at 0, so average is (0 + 975,000) / 2 = 487,500)\n\n*Actually, initial inventory was zero, so the average is:*\n\\[\n\\frac{0 + 975,000}{2} = 487,500\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{3,250,000}{487,500} \\approx 6.67\n\\]\nBut based on real practice, because initial inventory was zero, only the ending inventory matters for the ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover} = \\frac{3,250,000}{975,000} \\approx 3.33\n\\]\n\nHowever, considering average inventory more accurately: initial inventory was zero, ending is 975,000, so average is:\n\\[\n(0 + 975,000) / 2 = 487,500\n\\]\nwhich gives:\n\\[\n\\frac{3,250,000}{487,500} \\approx 6.67\n\\]\n\nUsing the more precise average, Inventory Turnover ≈ 6.67.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Owner's Equity}}\n\\]\n\n**Values:**\n- Total Liabilities = 1,124,588.25 (current liabilities only as no other liabilities are provided)\n- Owner's Equity = 14,163,543.07\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{1,124,588.25}{14,163,543.07} \\approx 0.0794\n\\]\n\n*Round to two decimal places: 0.08*\n\n---\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\n**Values:**\n- Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= (4,560,423.24 + 3,655,000.00 + 10,051.66 + 1,133,414.13)\n= 4,560,423.24 + 3,655,000 + 10,051.66 + 1,133,414.13 ≈ 9,358,888.69\n\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{9,358,888.69}{1,124,588.25} \\approx 8.32\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Formula:**\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\n**Values:**\n- Total Current Assets = 10,333,889.03\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{10,333,889.03}{1,124,588.25} \\approx 9.19\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final summarized ratios:\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio ≈ 0.19\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio ≈ 0.19\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio ≈ 6.67\n- Debt to Equity Ratio ≈ 0.08\n- Quick Ratio ≈ 8.32\n- Current Ratio ≈ 9.19\n\n---\n\n### Returning in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.19', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.19', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '6.67', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.08', 'Quick Ratio': '8.32', 'Current Ratio': '9.19'} }\n```",
