The first required line item is the amount of profit an entity retains after all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, are deducted from total revenue. This typically corresponds to the \"Net Profit\" in the statement.\n\n2. The second required line item relates to cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment, and other long-term assets. This is represented by the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" line item under the Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n- The \"Net Profit\" listed is 1,163,543.07.\n- The \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is 0.00, indicating no cash was spent on acquiring property, plant, or equipment during this period.\n\n**Therefore:**\n- The first value is the \"Net Profit\": 1163543.07.\n- The second value is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": 0.00.\n\n**Final answer in the prescribed JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1163543.07', 'value2': '0.00'}}\n```",
