The line item \"Main Business Revenue\" (or \"Total Revenue\") represents income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities.  \n   - The value for \"Main Business Revenue\" is 5,991,764.34  \n   - The value for \"Total Revenue\" is also 5,991,764.34\n\n2. The line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.  \n   - The value for \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is 3,250,000.00\n\nAccording to the task, I need to extract two specific line items and their values in the original order: \n- Income arising from core operations (represented by \"Main Business Revenue\")\n- Carrying amount of inventories sold (represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\")\n\nThe first line is \"Main Business Revenue\" with value 5,991,764.34  \nThe second line is \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with value 3,250,000.00\n\nNow, I'll format the answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5991764.34', 'value2': '3250000.00'}}\n```",
