Review total current assets, which typically include cash, receivables, inventory, and other assets expected to be converted to cash or consumed within the operating cycle.\n2. Filter the relevant accounts:\n   - Cash on Hand\n   - Bank Deposits\n   - Interest Receivable\n   - Accounts Receivable\n   - Inventory\n3. Sum their initial and end values, as these are the components expected to be realized or used in operations, including initial and final values as per task instruction.\n\nNow, summing the initial and end values:\n\nInitial values:\n- Cash on Hand: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank Deposits: 5,000,000.00\n- Interest Receivable: 0.00\n- Accounts Receivable: 0.00\n- Inventory: 0.00\n\nTotal initial = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 8,000,000.00\n\nEnd values:\n- Cash on Hand: 4,560,423.24\n- Bank Deposits: 3,655,000.00\n- Interest Receivable: 10,051.66\n- Accounts Receivable: 1,133,414.13\n- Inventory: 975,000.00\n\nTotal end = 4,560,423.24 + 3,655,000.00 + 10,051.66 + 1,133,414.13 + 975,000.00 = 10,333,889.03\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"10333889.03\"}}\n```",
