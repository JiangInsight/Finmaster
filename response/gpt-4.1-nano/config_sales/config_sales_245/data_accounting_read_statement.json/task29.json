Given the data:\n\n   - **Main Business Revenue** is the total revenue from operational activities.\n   - Since no further breakdown is provided, the simplest approach is to consider the entire amount as the sub-item.\n\n4. **Final output:**\n   - Total income (Total Revenue): 5,991,764.34\n   - Sub-item representing this total: Main Business Revenue = 5,991,764.34\n\nNow, let's format the answer accordingly.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"5991764.34\", \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"5991764.34\"}}\n```",
