We need to identify the net addition/decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the period, which is given explicitly as \"Net Increase\" under the cash flow statement.\n\n2. From the data:\n   - Beginning Balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents: 8,000,000.00\n   - Ending Balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents: 8,215,423.24\n   - Net Increase: 215,423.24 (which should equal ending balance minus beginning balance: 8,215,423.24 - 8,000,000.00 = 215,423.24)\n\n3. The task asks for:\n   - The specific line item value of net addition/decrease, which matches \"Net Increase\": 215,423.24\n   - To break down this net change into two component sub-items originating from the statement.\n\n4. The Cash Flow from Operating Activities and Cash Flow from Investing Activities are relevant:\n   - Operating activities net cash flow: 215,423.24\n   - Investing activities net cash flow: -0.00\n   - These total net cash flows should sum to the net change.\n\n5. Since the net change is solely driven by the operating activities (investing was zero), the two sub-items must be:\n   - Cash inflow from Operating Activities (or simply Operating activities net cash flow): 215,423.24\n   - Cash inflow/outflow from Investing Activities: 0.00 (or corresponding zero impact), but as per instructions, we want two component sub-items.\n\nGiven this reasoning, a logical decomposition is:\n\n- Sub-item 1: Cash flow from Operating Activities: 215,423.24\n- Sub-item 2: Cash flow from Investing Activities: 0.00\n\nHowever, since the net change is directly from operating activities, and investing activities net is zero, the entire net increase is due to operating activities, and the second component can be zero or the cash flows from investing which is zero.\n\n**Final step:**\n\n- The total net addition/decrease: 215,423.24\n- Sub-items:\n  - Sub-item 1: Operating activities cash flow: 215,423.24\n  - Sub-item 2: Investing activities cash flow: 0.00\n\nNow, format this into the JSON output as required.\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"215423.24\", \"sub_item value1\": \"215423.24\", \"sub_item value2\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
