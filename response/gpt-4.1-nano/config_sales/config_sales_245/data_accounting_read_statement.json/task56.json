From the balance sheet, the \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line shows how much depreciation has been allocated up to that date, which is 45,757.71.\n\n2. The \"Depreciation\" value appears in the cash flow statement, income statement, and is explicitly shown as 45,757.71.\n\n3. Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.\n\n4. The value consistently appearing as \"Depreciation\" in the income statement and cash flow statement indicates it is the amount of depreciation expense recognized during this period.\n\nTherefore, the line item representing the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life is **\"Depreciation\"** with a value of **45,757.71**.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"45757.71\"}}\n```",
