This is the current liability representing taxes the entity is expected to pay.\n\nStep 2: Review the cash flow statement:\n- The \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" line shows how the tax payable has changed during the period, which is 299,588.25. This confirms that the entity has recognized this amount as owed but not yet paid.\n\nStep 3: Consider the income statement:\n- The \"Tax Expense\" line confirms the amount of taxes expected for the period, which is 299,588.25, matching the tax payable at the end of the period.\n\nConclusion:\nThe total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period is represented by the \"Taxes Payable\" or \"Tax Expense,\" both indicating 299,588.25.\n\nAnswer:\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"299588.25\"}}",
