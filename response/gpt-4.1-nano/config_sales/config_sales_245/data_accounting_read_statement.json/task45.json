                        "content": "Let's analyze step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the net cash flow from operating activities:\n   - From the given data, \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" = 215,423.24\n\n2. To decompose this net amount into 7 components, we need to look at the items contributing to cash flows from operations, typically starting from Net Profit and adjusting for non-cash items and changes in working capital components.\n\n3. Relevant sub-items and their values are provided:\n   - Net Profit: 1,163,543.07\n   - Depreciation: 45,757.71\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable: -1,133,414.13\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable: -10,051.66\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Inventory: -975,000.00\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable: 825,000.00\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable: 299,588.25\n\n4. Summing these adjusted items should give the net cash flow from operating activities:\n   \n   Let's verify:\n   \n   ```\n   Net Profit: 1,163,543.07\n   + Depreciation: 45,757.71\n   + Decrease in Accounts Receivable: -1,133,414.13\n   + Decrease in Interest Receivable: -10,051.66\n   + Decrease in Inventory: -975,000.00\n   + Increase in Accounts Payable: 825,000.00\n   + Increase in Tax Payable: 299,588.25\n   \n   Sum:\n   1,163,543.07 + 45,757.71 - 1,133,414.13 - 10,051.66 - 975,000.00 + 825,000.00 + 299,588.25\n   \n   Let's do the calculation:\n   \n   1,163,543.07 + 45,757.71 = 1,209,300.78\n   1,209,300.78 - 1,133,414.13 = 75,886.65\n   75,886.65 - 10,051.66 = 65,834.99\n   65,834.99 - 975,000.00 = -909,165.01\n   -909,165.01 + 825,000.00 = -84,165.01\n   -84,165.01 + 299,588.25 = 215,423.24\n\n   This matches the \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" = 215,423.24.\n\nNow, breaking down into 7 sub-items (as per the example):\n\n- Starting from net profit (which is a key component)\n- Add back depreciation (non-cash expense)\n- Adjust for changes in receivables, inventory, payables, and interest\n\nSo, the 7 sub-items are:\n\n1. Net Profit\n2. Depreciation\n3. Change in Accounts Receivable\n4. Change in Interest Receivable\n5. Change in Inventory\n6. Change in Accounts Payable\n7. Change in Tax Payable\n\nFinal values are taken directly from the table.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer in requested JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value\": \"215423.24\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value1\": \"1163543.07\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value2\": \"45757.71\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value3\": \"-1133414.13\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value4\": \"-10051.66\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value5\": \"-975000.00\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value6\": \"825000.00\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value7\": \"299588.25\"\n  }\n}\n```",
