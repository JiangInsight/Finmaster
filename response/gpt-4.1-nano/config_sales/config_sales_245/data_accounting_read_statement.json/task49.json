Identify the line item representing the increase in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.\n   - Typically, this is reflected under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\"\n   - The value given is 825000.00, indicating an increase in accounts payable, meaning the entity owes more for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\n2. Find the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment.\n   - This is usually labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n   - The amount shown here is 0.00, indicating no acquisitions during this period.\n\n3. Determine the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.\n   - This is listed under \"Beginning Balance.\"\n   - The amount shown is 8000000.00.\n\nMatching these findings with the problem requirement:\n\n- Value 1 (amount owed for goods/services received/purchased on credit): 825000.00\n- Value 2 (acquisition of property, plant, and equipment): 0.00\n- Value 3 (cash and cash equivalents at beginning): 8000000.00\n\nNow, formatting the answer as per the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '825000.00', 'value2': '0.00', 'value3': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
