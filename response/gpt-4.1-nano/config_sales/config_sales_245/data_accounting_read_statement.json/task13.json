These typically include non-current assets, such as fixed assets (property, plant, equipment), and possibly investments or intangible assets if present. \n\nIn the given data:\n- Fixed Assets are listed as \"Fixed Assets\" with initial amount 5,000,000.00 and end amount 5,000,000.00.\n- Accumulated Depreciation is generally a contra asset account, reflecting depreciation on fixed assets, but it is not itself a separate asset for realization.\n- Total Non-current Assets are summarized as 5,000,000.00 initially and decreased slightly in the end.\n\nGiven that \"Fixed Assets\" are long-term assets not typically realized or intended for sale in normal operations, they qualify.\n\nNow, note the specific line items:\n- Fixed Assets (initial: 5,000,000.00; end: 5,000,000.00)\n- Total Non-current Assets (initial: 5,000,000.00; end: 4,954,242.29)\n\nSince the Total Non-current Assets includes fixed assets minus accumulated depreciation, the key asset for realization is the fixed assets directly.\n\nHowever, Total Non-current Assets represent a summary; the question appears to seek the specific line item of tangible fixed assets (which are most commonly considered non-current assets not intended for sale).\n\nTherefore, the relevant line item is **\"Fixed Assets\"** with initial value 5,000,000.00 and end value 5,000,000.00.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5000000.00'}}\n```",
