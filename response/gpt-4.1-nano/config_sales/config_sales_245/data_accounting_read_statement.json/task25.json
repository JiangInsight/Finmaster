Typically, these costs are reflected under selling expenses or similar categories. \n\nStep 1: Review the line items for relevant costs:\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Selling Expenses\n- Depreciation\n- Financial Expenses\n- Total Expenses\n\nStep 2: Determine which of these specifically relate to securing customer orders and delivering goods/services:\n- Selling Expenses generally cover costs related to marketing, sales staff, order processing, and delivery logistics.\n\nStep 3: From the provided data:\n- Selling Expenses = 782,775.93 (2024-01-29)\n\nSince \"Selling Expenses\" usually encompass costs involved in securing and delivering customer orders, this is the most appropriate line item.\n\nFinal step: Extract this value.\n\nAnswer:\n{\"solution\": {'value': '782775.93'}}\n",
