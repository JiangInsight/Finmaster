The problem describes the profit remaining after deducting all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, from total revenue. This is typically reflected as Net Profit, which is already provided in the data.\n\n2. In the given financial statement, the line item \"Net Profit\" directly states the profit after all expenses are deducted.\n\n3. No need to perform further calculations because \"Net Profit\" represents the retained profit after all expenses.\n\n4. The \"Net Profit\" value given is 1,163,543.07 on 2024-01-29.\n\nTherefore, the amount of profit the entity retains after all expenses is 1,163,543.07.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"1163543.07\"}}\n```",
