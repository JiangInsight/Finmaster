In a balance sheet, \"Retained Earnings\" represents the accumulated net income that has been retained in the company rather than distributed as dividends.\n\nStep 1: Find the initial and final values of \"Retained Earnings\" from the table.  \n- Initial value (2023-12-31): 0.00  \n- End value (2024-01-29): 1163543.07\n\nStep 2: The change in \"Retained Earnings\" over this period reflects the profit retained during the period (since initial was zero, this represents the profit earned and retained).\n\nStep 3: Confirm that this change is due to profit or loss retained, not a dividend payout or other adjustment. Given the context, \"Retained Earnings\" directly pertains to accumulated profits retained in the company.\n\nTherefore, the profit (or loss if negative) retained is the difference in \"Retained Earnings\" from initial to final.\n\nFinal answer:  \n- Initial value: 0.00  \n- End value: 1163543.07\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"1163543.07\"}}\n```",
