Initial Accounts Payable: 0.00 (on 2023-12-31)\n2. End Accounts Payable: 825,000.00 (on 2024-01-29)\n3. The change (increase) is calculated as:\n   Change = End amount - Initial amount\n   = 825,000.00 - 0.00\n   = 825,000.00\n4. Since the initial was zero and the balance increased, the addition in amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is 825,000.00.\n\nFinal answer in the requested JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '825000.00'}}\n```",
