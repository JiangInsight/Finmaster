                        "content": "First, identify the two specific line items of interest:\n\n1. Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers.\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment, and other long-term assets.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Finding costs incurred to secure orders and deliver goods/services**\n\n- From the **Income Statement**, typical line items related to these costs include selling and administrative expenses, and possibly depreciation (which is a non-cash expense).  \n- Specifically, **Selling Expenses** (associated with securing and delivering orders) and **Cost of Goods Sold** (related to delivering goods).  \n- By definition, **Cost of Goods Sold** directly relates to the costs of producing or delivering goods.\n- The **Selling Expenses** are also directly related to securing and delivering customer orders.\n  \nGiven the question's focus, the common interpretation is:\n\n- \"Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services\" = **Selling Expenses**.\n\n**From the first dataset:**\n\n| Account | Amount |  \n| --- | --- |  \n| Selling Expenses | 493854.67 |  \n\n- From the second dataset:  \n| Selling Expenses | 782775.93 |  \n\n**Decision:** Since the task's example solution uses the Selling Expenses (e.g., in the provided example, they used \"Selling Expenses\"):\n\n- **Value1**: Selling Expenses.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: For the costs to deliver goods/services**\n\n- The line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is the most comprehensive measure of costs directly related to delivering goods/services.\n\n**First dataset:**\n\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 4410000.00 |  \n\n**Second dataset:**\n\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 3250000.00 |  \n\n- The prompt indicates that the first value corresponds to the first dataset, and the second value to the second dataset.\n\n**Decision:** Typically, this is the \"cost to deliver the goods/services\" â€” i.e., **Cost of Goods Sold**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment**\n\n- From the **cash flow** statement, the relevant line is **\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\"**.\n- For dataset one, the purchase is **305354.43**.\n- For dataset two, it is **0.00**.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- \"costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers\" = **Selling Expenses**.\n- \"cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets\" = **Purchase of Fixed Assets**.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"493854.67\", \"value2\": \"305354.43\"}}\n```\n\nThis matches the pattern shown in the example output, where the first value is Selling Expenses and the second is Purchase of Fixed Assets.",
