No direct mention of the net cash generated from activities, taxes payable, or income. Usually, for cash-generating activity, the key data appears in cash flow statements.\n- Taxes accrued but not yet paid: \"Taxes Payable\" shows the amount not yet paid.\n- Total income from operations: not on the balance sheet, but can be inferred from net profit on the income statement.\n\n**From the balance sheet:**\n- Taxes payable = 299,588.25\n\n---\n\n### Income Statement\n- Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities = Net Profit = 1,163,543.07\n\n**From the income statement:**\n- Net Profit = 1,163,543.07\n\n---\n\n### Cash Flow Statement\n- Cash generated from principal revenue-producing activities = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n- The amount provided: 215,423.24 (from cash flow statement's \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\").\n- Taxes paid or payable are shown as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" — this is 299,588.25, indicating taxes accrued but not paid, which matches the amount on the balance sheet.\n\n**From the cash flow statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: 215,423.24\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Net cash generated from operating activities:** 215,423.24\n- **Taxes accrued but not yet paid:** 299,588.25\n- **Total income from ordinary activities (Net Profit):** 1,163,543.07\n\n---\n\n### Final answer in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"215423.24\", \"value2\": \"299588.25\", \"value3\": \"1163543.07\"}}\n```",
