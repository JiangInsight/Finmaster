This indicates no net cash flow from investing activities during this period.\n\n3. **Decompose into sub-items:**\n   - The sub-item under investing activities is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n   - The value of that sub-item is 0.00.\n\nSince the net amount is zero, the decomposition confirms that there were no acquisitions or disposals of long-term assets or investments, nor receipt of interest/dividends, during this period.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value\": \"-0.00\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"0.00\"\n  }\n}\n```",
