The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life:  \n   This is typically represented as **Depreciation**.\n\n2. Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period:  \n   Often reflected as **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory** or similar.  \n   Here, we have \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with an amount of -975000.00, indicating a decrease in inventory (which is a reduction in assets held for sale or in production).\n\n3. Cash and cash equivalents generated from activities involving the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents, and the receipt of interest and dividends:  \n   This is generally summarized as **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**.  \n   The entry shows -0.00, meaning no net cash flow from investing activities.\n\n4. Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period:  \n   Typically, this is **Net Increase** in cash and cash equivalents.  \n   The amount here is 215423.24.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Extract the values for each**\n\n- Value1 (systematic allocation of depreciation): **45757.71**  \n- Value2 (reduction in assets held for sale/in production): **-975000.00**  \n- Value3 (cash flow from asset purchase/disposal, etc.): **-0.00**  \n- Value4 (net increase in cash and equivalents): **215423.24**\n\n---\n\n**Final answer in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '45757.71', 'value2': '-975000.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '215423.24'} }\n```\n",
