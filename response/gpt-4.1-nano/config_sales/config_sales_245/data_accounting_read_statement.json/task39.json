                        "content": "To identify the reduction in the amount of assets held for sale, we need to look for specific line items in the cash flow statement that indicate a decrease in assets classified as held for sale, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured. Typically, such reductions are reflected as an inflow of cash and are usually explicitly labeled or associated with asset disposition activities.\n\nIn this provided cash flow statement, the relevant line item that indicates a reduction in assets held for sale is:\n\n- \"Decrease\" in assets held for sale, or similar wording.\n\nLet's examine the data step by step:\n\n1. The statement details various cash flows, but there is no explicit line item mentioning assets \"held for sale,\" \"in production for sale,\" or \"manufacturing in progress.\"\n\n2. The only line that aligns with asset reduction is under the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" but the line \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" indicates asset acquisition, not disposal.\n\n3. There is no line item explicitly indicating sale or disposal of assets held for sale.\n\n4. Since the problem specifically asks for reduction in assets held for sale, but no sale or disposal activity is explicitly reported in the given data, the strongest candidate for such a reduction—if implied—is not explicitly present.\n\n**However,** sometimes, reductions in assets, like inventory, could relate to assets in the process of being manufactured or held for sale. In the data, the line:\n\n- \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with a value of **-975,000.00**.\n\nA negative change in inventory indicates a decrease in inventory, which may reflect the sale or reduction of inventory assets, possibly assets held for sale or in production, depending on context.\n\nBut since the task specifically asks for \"assets held for sale,\" the most accurate answer based solely on the cash flow statement data and typical practice is to identify any line item reflecting asset reduction related to assets held for sale.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The only relevant line item (because no specific line is provided otherwise) is the decrease in inventory, which is -975,000.00.\n\nGiven the context and typical presentation, this reduction could be associated with assets held for sale in inventory.\n\n**Final step:**\n\n- Extract the amount of the asset reduction: **-975000.00**\n\nHence, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-975000.00'}}\n```",
