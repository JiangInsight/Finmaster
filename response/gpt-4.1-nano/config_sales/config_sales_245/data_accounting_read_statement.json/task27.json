This typically corresponds to the \"Depreciation\" expense.\n\nStep 2: Find the relevant line item.\nLooking at the provided income statement, the line labeled \"Depreciation\" shows an amount of 45757.71 for the date 2024-01-29.\n\nStep 3: Confirm if this is the accumulated depreciation.\nBased on typical income statement reports, \"Depreciation\" refers to the expense for the period and the amount provided likely represents the depreciation expense for that period, not the accumulated depreciation. \n\nHowever, since the question asks explicitly for the \"accumulated systematic allocation,\" if the statement reports only the expense for the period (which is standard in income statements), then that amount is the depreciation expense for the period.\n\nBut frequently, \"accumulated depreciation\" is a balance sheet line item, not an income statement item. Yet, based solely on the income statement, the depreciation line item shows the amount of depreciation expense in that period.\n\nGiven the task and the pattern from the example, the expectation is to identify this depreciation expense line rather than accumulated depreciation balance, because income statements usually show current period depreciation expense.\n\nHence, the value to extract is the amount of depreciation expense reported:\n\n45757.71\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45757.71'}}\n\n---\n\n**Final JSON:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"45757.71\"}}\n```",
