This account reflects amounts owed to the company for sales or services provided on credit.\n\nExamining the data:\n- The initial value of \"Accounts Receivable\" is 0.00.\n- The end value of \"Accounts Receivable\" is 1,133,414.13.\n\nSince the initial value was zero and the end value increased, this indicates new credit sales or services provided on credit during the period. Therefore, \"Accounts Receivable\" is the line item of concern.\n\nAnswer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1133414.13'} }\n```",
