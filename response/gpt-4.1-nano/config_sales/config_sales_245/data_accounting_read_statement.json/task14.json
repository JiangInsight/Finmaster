Current liabilities are short-term obligations that are typically settled within the operating cycle. \n\nFrom the provided table:\n- Initial current liabilities (on 2023-12-31): 0.00\n- End current liabilities (on 2024-01-29): 1,124,588.25\n\nSince the initial value is zero and the end value reflects the liabilities settled or incurred during this period, the total liabilities expected to be settled in the normal course are represented by the end value of current liabilities.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1124588.25'}}\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1124588.25'} }\n```",
