An increase in accounts payable indicates that the company has purchased goods or services on credit that it has not yet paid for, thereby increasing its amount owed.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Locate the relevant account: \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\"\n2. Check its value: 1820000.00.\n3. Since it's an increase, it indicates the company has purchased on credit, increasing what it owes.\n4. The amount of this increase is the value owed for credit purchases during the period.\n\nFinal answer: 1820000.00\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"1820000.00\"}}\n```",
