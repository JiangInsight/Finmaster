                        "content": "Let's identify and extract the three specific line items from the given income statement.\n\nThe required line items are:\n1. Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities (commonly referred to as \"Total Revenue\" or similar).\n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period (typically \"Cost of Goods Sold\").\n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole (generally \"Administrative Expenses\").\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n- For total income: The line titled \"Total Revenue\" directly reflects the total income arising from ordinary activities.\n- For inventories sold: The line \"Cost of Goods Sold\" reports the carrying amount of inventories sold.\n- For administrative costs: The line \"Administrative Expenses\" captures the costs of general management and administration.\n\nNow, extracting the values:\n- Total Revenue: 5813420.67\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 3175000.00\n- Administrative Expenses: 191069.49\n\nFinally, formatting the answer as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5813420.67', 'value2': '3175000.00', 'value3': '191069.49'}}\n```",
