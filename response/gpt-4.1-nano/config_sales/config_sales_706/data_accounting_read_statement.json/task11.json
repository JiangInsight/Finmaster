According to the balance sheet data, the \"Retained Earnings\" initially was 0.00 and increased to 1,103,190.60. \n\nThis change reflects the accumulation of profit (net income) retained in the business over the period, since it wasn't distributed as dividends or otherwise.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Initial retained earnings: 0.00\n2. Final retained earnings: 1,103,190.60\n3. The change in retained earnings (net profit or loss retained) is the difference between final and initial: 1,103,190.60 - 0.00 = 1,103,190.60.\n\nThus, the retained profit (or loss) in the period is 1,103,190.60.\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"1103190.60\"}}\n```",
