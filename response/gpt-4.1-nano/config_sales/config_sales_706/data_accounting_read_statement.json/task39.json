                        "content": "First, I need to identify the line item related to the reduction in the amount of assets held for sale, which are assets in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period, based on the given cash flow statement.\n\nReviewing the provided data:\n\n- The relevant section is under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\"\n- The line item related to changes in assets held for sale in accounting typically appears as \"Assets held for sale\" or similar wording, but in this case, the only line under investing activities is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which is unrelated.\n- The data does not explicitly mention assets held for sale or similar, but the problem references \"reduction in the amount of assets held for sale\" during the period.\n\nConsidering the typical presentation:\n\n- Assets held for sale are often decrease or increase shown in cash flow statements due to sale or disposal.\n- Since there is no direct item about assets held for sale, but given the context, assets disposed of (or reduced) would be reflected in cash flows if relevant.\n\nHowever, the only relevant line is:\n\n- \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" which here is negative, indicating investments or disposals.\n\nAdditionally, the question explicitly asks for the **reduction in assets held for sale**, which generally would show as a decrease in such assets (a \"reduction\"), reflected as a cash inflow (sale proceeds) or outflow (asset disposal).\n\nIn this case, since no direct line item indicates \"assets held for sale,\" the most relevant related line is **not explicitly provided**. But we might infer that the disposal of assets would show as a positive cash flow or decrease assets.\n\nGiven the data, the only line that might be related to assets disposed or reduced that is explicitly visible is **\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\"**, which is **-352857.55**, but that shows an overall investment expenditure, a purchase, not an asset reduction.\n\nSince the instructions specify to identify and extract the \"specific line items and value\" of reduction in assets held for sale, and such line item is **not explicitly listed**, the best interpretation is that the asset reduction value should match the change in cash associated with disposal.\n\nIn this scenario, the only relevant numeric change indicating a reduction in assets is:\n\n- Not explicitly listed, but often, asset disposal proceeds would be reflected as cash inflow, which is absent here.\n\nAlternatively, analyzing the asset amount:\n\n- The beginning balance of cash is 8,000,000.00, ending is 9,245,580.45, indicating overall cash increase.\n\nGiven the data, and understanding typical cash flow reporting, **if assets held for sale assets are disposed of, the reduction would be reflected in a cash inflow**.\n\nIn the absence of any explicit \"Assets held for sale\" line, perhaps the intended answer is a zero or null value indicating no explicit reduction.\n\nBut, since the user is asking for a specific line item and value, considering the most relevant data, the only cash flow that could relate to reduction in assets is the cash inflow from disposal, which might be part of \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" but here it is negative, indicating net investments, not disposals.\n\n**Alternatively**, perhaps the best approach is to look for any item that references \"assets held for sale\" explicitly.\n\nFinal conclusion:\n\n- Since no such line item exists, if the question is based on the pattern, the only plausible data reflecting reduction in assets held for sale would be **the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\"**, which indicates an investment, not reduction.\n\n- Hence, if assets are being reduced, that would be a sale, reflected as a cash inflow, but no such is indicated.\n\n- Given the absence of explicit information, the most appropriate answer is that **there is no explicit reduction in assets held for sale documented in these statements**.\n\n**Therefore, the value of reduction is zero or not applicable.**\n\n**However, the task asks for the line item and value â€” if no explicit line is provided, perhaps the most logical answer is to set the value to null or zero.**\n\n**Alternatively, considering standard practice, sometimes \"Assets Held for Sale\" are disclosed separately; if not present, then no data.**\n\nBased on this analysis, I will set the value to 0.00.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
