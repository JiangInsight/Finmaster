The task asks for two specific items:\n   - The income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities.\n   - The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\n2. Core operating activities typically relate to the main revenue-generating activities of the business, which are often reflected as \"Main Business Revenue\" or similar. In the dataset, \"Main Business Revenue\" appears as the primary line item for income.\n\n3. The inventory sold amount is represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS), which indicates the carrying amount of inventories sold during the period.\n\n4. The dataset has:\n   - \"Main Business Revenue\": 5813420.67\n   - \"Cost of Goods Sold\": 3175000.00\n\n5. The order of these items matches the original order, so the first is income from core activities and the second is inventories sold.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"5813420.67\", \"value2\": \"3175000.00\"}}\n```",
