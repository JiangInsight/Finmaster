In the balance sheet, such assets typically include \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation\", as they are intended for long-term use rather than sale.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify total non-current assets**: From the balance sheet, the relevant line is \"Total Non-current Assets.\"\n2. **Check the initial and end values**:\n   - Initial value of Total Non-current Assets: 5,000,000.00\n   - End value of Total Non-current Assets: 5,307,107.79\n3. **Exclude accumulated depreciation**: \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is a contra-asset account and not a separate class of assets, so it is not considered as a separate asset item in this context.\n4. **Determine the specific line items**:\n   - The main asset component here is \"Fixed Assets\" (or \"Property, Plant, and Equipment\" in some descriptions). Its initial and final values are explicitly listed:\n     - Initial: 5,000,000.00\n     - End: 5,352,857.55\n5. **Final answer**: The fixed assets are the assets not expected to be realized or intended for sale, held for long-term use.\n\nThis aligns with the example provided.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5352857.55'}}\n```",
