These typically include sales or selling expenses directly related to customer acquisition and order fulfillment processes.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The account titles that typically relate to costs of securing customer orders and delivering goods/services include \"Selling Expenses\" because they generally cover costs associated with sales activities such as marketing, sales commissions, and distribution costs.\n\n2. Other expense categories like \"Administrative Expenses,\" \"Depreciation,\" \"Financial Expenses,\" etc., do not directly relate to the costs of securing and delivering customer orders.\n\n3. From the provided income statement data, the relevant line item appears to be \"Selling Expenses.\"\n\n4. The value for \"Selling Expenses\" in the data is 731171.32 (for the date 2024-01-28).\n\nConclusion: The specific line item related to costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services is \"Selling Expenses\" with the amount 731171.32.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '731171.32'} }\n```",
