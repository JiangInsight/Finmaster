Revenue (or Total Revenue)\n     2. Cost of Goods Sold (or related cost)\n     3. Operating Expenses (sum of Administrative, Selling, Depreciation)\n     4. Financial Items (interest income and expenses)\n\n4. **Extract the initial and final values for each sub-item**:\n   - Revenue: 5,813,420.67\n   - Cost of Goods Sold: 3,175,000.00\n   - Operating Expenses: sum of Administrative Expenses (191,069.49), Selling Expenses (731,171.32), Depreciation (45,749.76)\n     - Sum: 191,069.49 + 731,171.32 + 45,749.76 = 968,990.57\n   - Financial Items: Interest Income (10,710.07), Financial Expenses (287,278.52)\n\nNow, prepare the final JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value\": \"1393861.65\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value1\": \"5813420.67\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value2\": \"3175000.00\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value3\": \"968990.57\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value4\": \"10710.07\"\n  }\n}\n```",
