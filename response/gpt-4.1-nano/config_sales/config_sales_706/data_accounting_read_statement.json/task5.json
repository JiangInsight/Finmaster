Review the provided balance sheet data, focusing on asset line items.\n2. Look for \"Inventory\" since it typically includes assets held for sale or in process of sale.\n3. Check initial and end values for \"Inventory\" as they probably reflect assets held for sale.\n\nAnalyzing the data:\n\n- Initial inventory value: 0.00\n- End inventory value: 295,000.00 (for the second statement)\n\nThis indicates assets in process of being sold or held for sale at the end of the period.\n\nConclusion:\n\n- The relevant line item is \"Inventory\"\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- Final value: 295,000.00\n\nAnswer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"295000.00\"}}\n```",
