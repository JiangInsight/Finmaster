Accounts Receivable: **1355463.34** (from the balance sheet end amount)\n2. Financing costs (Financial Expenses):  \n   - First problem: **432511.69**  \n   - Second problem: **287278.52**  \n   - Since we're to extract the relevant value, it makes sense to pick from the first problem set (matching the context of the task).  \n3. Purchase of Fixed Assets:  \n   - First problem: **305354.43**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Prepare the grouped output:**\n\n- **Balance Sheet:** Account and value  \n  - Accounts Receivable: 1355463.34\n\n- **Income Statement:** Financial Expenses (financing costs)  \n  - 432511.69\n\n- **Cash Flow Statement:** Cash payments for property, plant, and equipment  \n  - 305354.43\n\nFinally, format the answer in the required JSON structure.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1355463.34', 'value2': '432511.69', 'value3': '305354.43'}}\n```",
