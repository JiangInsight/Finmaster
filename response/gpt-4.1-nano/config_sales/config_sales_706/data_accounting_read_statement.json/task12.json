These generally include current assets such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and other assets that are part of the company's regular operations.\n\nFrom the data provided:\n- \"Cash on Hand\" is part of cash equivalents.\n- \"Bank Deposits\" are cash equivalents or short-term investments.\n- \"Interest Receivable\" pertains to interest expected to be received.\n- \"Accounts Receivable\" are amounts owed by customers, expected to be received.\n- \"Inventory\" are goods intended for sale in the normal course of business.\n\nAll these collectively comprise current assets that are expected to be either realized or consumed within the operating cycle.\n\nNow, sum the initial and end values of these items:\n- Initial values:\n  - Cash on Hand: 3,000,000.00\n  - Bank Deposits: 5,000,000.00\n  - Interest Receivable: 0.00\n  - Accounts Receivable: 0.00\n  - Inventory: 0.00\n  - Total initial current assets: 8,000,000.00\n\n- End values:\n  - Cash on Hand: 5,603,438.00\n  - Bank Deposits: 3,642,142.45\n  - Interest Receivable: 10,710.07\n  - Accounts Receivable: 1,355,463.34\n  - Inventory: 295,000.00\n  - Total end current assets: 10,906,753.86\n\nThus, the answer is based on these line items with their respective initial and final values.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"10906753.86\"}}\n```",
