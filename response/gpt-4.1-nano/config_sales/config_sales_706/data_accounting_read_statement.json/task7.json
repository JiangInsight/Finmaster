Expenses are typically reflected as decreases in assets or increases in liabilities, or as specific expense line items in the profit or loss statement. In this balance sheet data, expenses are not directly listed, but the change in certain accounts over time can indicate expenses.\n\n2. The key accounts to examine are:\n   - **Retained Earnings**: The change in retained earnings can reflect net income or losses, which are influenced by expenses.\n   - Additionally, *Accumulated Depreciation* increases represent depreciation expenses during the period.\n\n3. From the data:\n   - Initial Retained Earnings: 0.00\n   - Final Retained Earnings: 1,103,190.60\n   - Initial Accumulated Depreciation: 0.00\n   - Final Accumulated Depreciation: 45,749.76\n\n4. The change in retained earnings (assuming no dividends or other adjustments) approximately reflects net income, which includes expenses.\n\n5. The increase in accumulated depreciation (about 45,749.76 from initial to final) represents depreciation expenses.\n\nThus, combining the increase in accumulated depreciation gives us a partial picture of expenses.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Depreciation expense: 45,749.76\n\nSince no other expense line items (like salaries, cost of goods sold, etc.) are provided, the only concrete expense identified here is depreciation expense.\n\n**Final step:**\n- Initial value (Accumulated Depreciation): 0.00\n- Final value: 45,749.76\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '45749.76'}}\n```",
