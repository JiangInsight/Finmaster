Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers\n2. Financing costs incurred to raise funds needed for production and operation\n3. The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life\n4. Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during the reporting period\n\nIn the provided income statement, we look for line items that match these descriptions:\n\n- For costs to secure and deliver goods/services, the relevant line item is typically \"Selling Expenses\" or similar.\n- For financing costs, the relevant line item is \"Financial Expenses.\"\n- For systematic depreciation, the relevant line item is \"Depreciation.\"\n- For taxes, the relevant line item is \"Tax Expense.\"\n\nNow, extracting the values from the data:\n\n- Selling Expenses: 731171.32\n- Financial Expenses: 287278.52\n- Depreciation: 45749.76\n- Tax Expense: 290671.05\n\nFinally, assemble these in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"731171.32\", \"value2\": \"45749.76\", \"value3\": \"287278.52\", \"value4\": \"290671.05\"}}\n```",
