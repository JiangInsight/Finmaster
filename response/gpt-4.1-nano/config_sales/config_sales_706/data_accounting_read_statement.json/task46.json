                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to identify from the cash flow statement the line item representing the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from long-term asset acquisitions and disposals, as well as receipt of interest and dividends. This information is typically captured under the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Locate the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section.\n2. The key item of interest is the net cash flow from investing activities, which represents cash paid or received due to acquiring or disposing of long-term assets or other investments.\n3. From the provided data:\n   - \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = 352857.55\n   - \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" = -352857.55\n\nSince \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is the principal component representing cash outflows from asset acquisition, and the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" totals -352857.55, this is our specific line item value.\n\n4. Typically, the cash flow from acquiring and disposing of long-term assets and investments is summarized in \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\". The sub-item here is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" as a main component.\n\nFinal step:\n- The net amount generated (or used) from these activities is -352857.55.\n- The primary component that contributed to this net amount is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n\nTherefore, the decomposed sub-item:\n\n- Sub-item: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" value = 352857.55\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-352857.55', 'sub_item value': '352857.55'}}\n```",
