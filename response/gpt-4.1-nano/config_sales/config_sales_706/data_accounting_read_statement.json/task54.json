Examine the Income Statement, as costs related to sales and delivery often appear here as \"Selling Expenses\" or similar line items.\n2. In the given income statements, there is a line called \"Selling Expenses\" in both cases.\n3. Selling Expenses typically include costs incurred for marketing, sales commissions, transportation of goods to customers, and other costs directly related to securing and delivering customer orders.\n4. In the first data set, \"Selling Expenses\" are 493,854.67.\n5. In the second data set, \"Selling Expenses\" are 731,171.32.\n6. Since the task asks for the specific line item and value, and the most relevant line item for costs to secure orders and deliver goods/services is \"Selling Expenses,\" I will select \"Selling Expenses\" as the answer.\n\nAnswer: 493,854.67 (from the first data set)\n\nThis matches the example in the prompt, where \"Selling Expenses\" was the specific item.\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"493854.67\"}}\n```",
