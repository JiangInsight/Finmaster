But generally, the line item that captures costs to both secure orders and deliver goods/services in typical financial statements is reflected in **Selling Expenses** (for securing and delivering), and **Cost of Goods Sold** for the actual production/delivery cost.\n\nGiven the instructions and common interpretation, the two line items are:\n1. **Selling Expenses** (costs to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services)\n2. **Cost of Goods Sold** (cost to deliver the goods/services)\n\n### Step 2: Identify cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment \nThis information is in the cash flow from investing activities:\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets** indicates the cash outflows for acquiring property, plant, and equipment.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets = 352,857.55\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n- First value: Selling Expenses (costs to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services): 731,171.32\n- Second value: Purchase of Fixed Assets (cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment): 352,857.55\n\n### JSON output:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '731171.32', 'value2': '352857.55'}}\n```",
