Identify Total Liabilities (Debts):\n   From the balance sheet, total liabilities are represented by \"Total Current Liabilities.\"  \n   As of 2024-01-28, Total Current Liabilities = 2,110,671.05\n\n2. Identify Total Owner's Equity:\n   As of 2024-01-28, Total Owner's Equity = 14,103,190.60\n\n3. Calculate Debt to Equity Ratio:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{2,110,671.05}{14,103,190.60} \\approx 0.1497\n   \\]\n\n4. Round the ratio to two decimal places for clarity:\n   0.15\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.15\"}}\n```",
