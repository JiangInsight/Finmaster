From the data, the earliest balance sheet items are:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000\n- Fixed Assets: 8,000,000\n\nTotal initial paid-in capital:\n\\[ 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 16,000,000 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the end period total capital\nThe total capital at the end includes the original capital plus any additional paid-in capital (e.g., share issuance), minus withdrawals, plus retained earnings. Since the dataset does not specify retained earnings or changes in share capital, we consider only the initial value for changes.\n\nHowever, to confirm, let's check the final balance sheet items:\n- The last entries show significant balances with purchases, sales, and cash transfers, but not specifically additional paid-in capital.\n\nGiven the data, the only clear recorded initial capital is **16,000,000**.\n\n### Step 3: Final value\nThe total assets at the end can be approximated by summing up current asset-like items:\n- Cash, receivables, inventory, fixed assets, etc.\n\nBut since the problem specifies the paid-in capital, and the data shows that the company started with 16 million, and there are no indications of new share issuances or reductions, the paid-in capital remains the same unless explicitly changed.\n\n### Final conclusion:\n- Initial paid-in capital: 16,000,000\n- Final paid-in capital: 16,000,000 (no data indicating change)\n\n### Final answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\", \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"16000000.00\"}}\n```",
