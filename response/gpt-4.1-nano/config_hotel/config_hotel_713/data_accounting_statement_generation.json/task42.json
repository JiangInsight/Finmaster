Some transactions include tax amounts (tax_amount), and some transactions affect tax payable.\n\n**Goal:** Calculate the final change (increase or decrease) in the tax payable item in the cash flow statement based on these transactions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify relevant transactions affecting tax payable\n\nTransactions involving tax_amount:\n- They are primarily associated with sales or purchases where taxes are incurred or paid.\n- Tax amounts are positive when taxes are owed (e.g., from sales).\n- When taxes are paid (cash outflows), tax payable decreases.\n- When taxes are accrued (e.g., sales with tax), they increase tax payable.\n\n### Step 2: Sum all tax amounts associated with sales (tax collected) and purchases (input tax)\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Summarize the transactions in data\n\nSince the data is extensive, I will analyze and sum the relevant tax impacts:\n\n1. **Sales with tax:**\n   -
