                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided financial data step by step.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n* Formula: Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n* Operating Cash Flow (from cash flow statement): -2,868,695.86\n* Total Debt = Current Liabilities + Long-term Debt\n  * Current Liabilities (from balance sheet): 5,042,389.63\n  * Since there's no explicit long-term debt listed, assume total debt = current liabilities.\n* Calculation:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-2,868,695.86}{5,042,389.63} \\approx -0.57\n  \\]\n* Note: The example shows a negative ratio similar to -3.90, but based on the data, our calculation is approximately -0.57.\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n* Same numerator as Operating Cash Flow, denominator as total debt.\n* Using the same assumption:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{-2,868,695.86}{5,042,389.63} \\approx -0.57\n  \\]\n* Since the example's ratio was -3.90, our ratio aligns with the same approach.\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n* Formula: Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n* Cost of Goods Sold: 353,220.00\n* Inventory at start: 7,848,830.00\n* Inventory at end: 7,848,830.00 (assuming no info on interim change, using end values)\n* Since only end inventory is given, approximate average inventory as end inventory:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Inventory Turnover} = \\frac{353,220.00}{7,848,830.00} \\approx 0.045\n  \\]\n* The example's ratio was roughly 1.73, but here, given the high inventory value relative to COGS, ratio is low. To get a more realistic figure, we can assume the average is close to end inventory for simplicity.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n* Formula: Total Debt / Owners' Equity\n* Total Debt: current liabilities (assume no long-term debt indicated): 5,042,389.63\n* Owner’s Equity: 16,056,497.85\n* Calculation:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{5,042,389.63}{16,056,497.85} \\approx 0.31\n  \\]\n* The example ratio was 0.16, but our calculation uses the data available.\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio\n* Formula: (Cash + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n* Cash: 2,179,154.14\n* Accounts Receivable: 200,359.99\n* Interest Receivable: 9,881.70\n* Sum: 2,179,154.14 + 200,359.99 + 9,881.70 = 2,389,395.83\n* Divide by current liabilities:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2,389,395.83}{5,042,389.63} \\approx 0.47\n  \\]\n* The example's quick ratio was about 1.54—our calculation suggests a lower liquidity position.\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n* Formula: Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n* Current Assets: 13,190,375.83\n* Current Liabilities: 5,042,389.63\n* Calculation:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{13,190,375.83}{5,042,389.63} \\approx 2.62\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n**Final answers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.57\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.57\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"0.045\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.31\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.47\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"2.62\"\n  }\n}\n```",
