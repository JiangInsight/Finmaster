                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided data step-by-step to calculate the Required Ratios.\n\n---\n\n**1. Current Ratio**\n\nThe **Current Ratio** is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its short-term assets:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n\n- Total Current Assets = 13,190,375.83\n- Total Current Liabilities = 5,042,389.63\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{13,190,375.83}{5,042,389.63} \\approx 2.62\n\\]\n\n**Note:** The previous example used a Current Ratio of 4.27, but our calculation based on given data is approximately 2.62.\n\n---\n\n**2. Inventory Turnover Ratio**\n\nThe **Inventory Turnover Ratio** indicates how many times inventory is sold and replaced over a period:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 353,220.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end of period):\n\n- Inventory at end of period = 7,848,830.00\n\nGiven only end-period inventory, and no previous period data, we will assume the starting inventory is zero or negligible, so the average inventory roughly equals the ending inventory.\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{353,220.00}{7,848,830.00} \\approx 0.045\n\\]\n\nThis seems very low, which indicates inventory turns roughly 0.045 times in the period, meaning inventory is turned over about once every 22 periods (or very slowly).  \nAlternatively, considering the context and typical business practice, and since only end data is provided, using the end inventory as average inventory is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Final answers:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Current Ratio\": \"2.62\", \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"0.045\"}}\n```",
