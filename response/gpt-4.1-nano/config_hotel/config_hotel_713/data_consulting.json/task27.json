                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided data step-by-step to calculate the required ratios:\n\n### Step 1: Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n- From the cash flow statement:\n  - Net Profit = 56,497.85\n  - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -2,868,695.86\n\n- Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Net Income\n- Importantly, Operating Cash Flow is derived directly from the cash flow statement — here, it is -2,868,695.86 (cash flows are consistent with the data).\n\n- Calculation:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{-2,868,695.86}{56,497.85} \\approx -50.78\n  \\]\n  \n- However, ratio usually refers to the magnitude or test of cash flow coverage, so considering absolute value:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\approx 50.78\n  \\]\n\n*(Note: The provided example's ratio is around 4.41, but our calculated ratio is quite high due to significant cash flow decrease relative to net income. We will present the actual computed value.)*\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Turnover Ratio (Total Assets Turnover)\n- From the balance sheet:\n  - Total Assets at the end = 21,098,887.48\n- From the income statement:\n  - Total Revenue = 547,392.30\n\n- Turnover Ratio:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}}\n  \\]\n  \n- Since only end-of-period assets are provided and no beginning balance:\n  - Assume midpoint (average) ≈ end balance (approximate for this scenario).\n\n- Calculation:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{547,392.30}{21,098,887.48} \\approx 0.0259\n  \\]\n\n*(Expressed as a ratio: approximately 0.026)*\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Quick Ratio\n- Quick Assets include Cash, Interest Receivable, Accounts Receivable.\n- From the balance sheet:\n  - Cash on Hand = 2,179,154.14\n  - Interest Receivable = 9,881.70\n  - Accounts Receivable = 200,359.99\n- Total Quick Assets:\n  \\[\n  2,179,154.14 + 9,881.70 + 200,359.99 = 2,389,395.83\n  \\]\n- Current liabilities:\n  - Accounts Payable = 5,015,020.00\n  - Taxes Payable = 27,369.63\n  - Total current liabilities = 5,042,389.63\n\n- Quick Ratio:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{2,389,395.83}{5,042,389.63} \\approx 0.473\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### Final results:\n- Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: approximately **50.78**\n- Turnover Ratio: approximately **0.026**\n- Quick Ratio: approximately **0.473**\n\n---\n\n### Presenting in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"50.78\", \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.026\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.473\"}}\n```",
