                        "content": "Let's start by understanding what the Inventory Turnover Ratio is and how to calculate it.\n\n**Inventory Turnover Ratio formula:**\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are provided with year-end inventory amounts:\n- End inventory: **7,848,830.00**\n\nSince no beginning inventory is explicitly provided, and given the data structure, a common approach is to use the year-end inventory as the average inventory if no other data is available or to assume beginning inventory is zero (though less accurate). But typically, when only end inventories are provided, and no beginning figure is given, we consider the inventory value as the average.\n\nHowever, in this case, the \"Initial_amount\" for inventory is 0.00 (see the balance sheet), suggesting the starting inventory was zero, and it increased to 7,848,830.00. For simplicity, and since no explicit beginning inventory, we can approximate average inventory as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- Beginning inventory = 0.00\n- Ending inventory = 7,848,830.00\n\nAverage inventory:\n\\[\n\\frac{0 + 7,848,830.00}{2} = 3,924,415.00\n\\]\n\nNext, we look at the COGS:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 353,220.00 (from the income statement for the second problem)\n\nCalculate the ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{353,220.00}{3,924,415.00} \\approx 0.09\n\\]\n\nBut looking at the previous example, they have a ratio of 1.73 for a similar scale inventory and COGS (roughly).\n\nHowever, it appears in the previous solution, they used the actual inventory amount at the end (without averaging). Let's try that approach:\n\nUsing **end inventory** directly:\n\\[\n\\frac{353,220.00}{7,848,830.00} \\approx 0.045\n\\]\n\nwhich is quite low.\n\nAlternatively, considering the previous example, the ratio was calculated based on total COGS and average inventory, possibly over a period.\n\nGiven the pattern, in the previous example, the ratio was 1.73 with similar methods.\n\nTo unify, most financial ratios use the average inventory; hence, we'll proceed with the average inventory calculation.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{353,220}{3,924,415} \\approx 0.09\n\\]\n\nResult rounded appropriately:\n- Approximately **0.09**\n\n**Therefore, the Inventory Turnover Ratio is about 0.09** (indicating how many times inventory is turned over during the period).\n\n---\n\n### Final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"0.09\"}}\n```",
