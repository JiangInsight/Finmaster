                        "content": "Let's analyze the given cash flow statement step-by-step to identify the four specific line items:\n\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life:**  \n   This is typically represented as \"Depreciation\" in the cash flow statement.\n\n   - From the data: `\"Depreciation\": 91488.35` on 2024-02-05\n\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period:**  \n   This refers to \"write-downs\" or reductions in assets held for sale.  \n   \n   - Such items are often reflected as decreases in inventory or assets held for sale, but the statement explicitly mentions a reduction in assets held for sale, which may correspond to a decrease in inventory or specific asset items.  \n   \n   - In this data, Inventory change is listed as \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": -7,848,830.00  \n   \n   - Since this is a decrease, it aligns with a reduction in assets held for sale.\n\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends:**  \n   - This generally covers cash flows from investing activities, including the purchase and sale of assets, investments, and receipt of interest/dividends.  \n   - The closest figure reflecting this impact, excluding financing and operations, is \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".  \n   \n   - From the data: `\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": -0.00`, which indicates no net cash flow from investments during this period.\n\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period:**  \n   - This is directly given as \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents.  \n   \n   - From the data: `\"Net Increase\": -2868695.86`.\n\n---\n\n### Final extracted values:\n- Value 1 (Depreciation): 91488.35\n- Value 2 (Reduction in assets held for sale): -7848830.00\n- Value 3 (Cash from acquisition/disposal of long-term assets and investments): -0.00\n- Value 4 (Net increase in cash and cash equivalents): -2868695.86\n\n---\n\n### Presenting the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91488.35', 'value2': '-7848830.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '-2868695.86'} }\n```",
