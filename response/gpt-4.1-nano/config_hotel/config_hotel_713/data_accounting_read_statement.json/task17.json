The amount owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit (Accounts Receivable).\n2. The amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit (Accounts Payable).\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Accounts Receivable (`End_amount`=200,359.99) reflects amounts owed to the organization for credit sales.\n- Accounts Payable (`End_amount`=5,015,020.00) reflects amounts owed by the organization for credit purchases.\n\nNow, we need the initial and final values for each of these items:\n\n- For Accounts Receivable:\n  - Initial value: 0.00\n  - Final value: 200,359.99\n\n- For Accounts Payable:\n  - Initial value: 0.00\n  - Final value: 5,015,020.00\n\nFinally, maintaining the order as shown: first the receivables, then the payables.\n\nThe answer should be formatted as follows:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': 'XXXXX', 'end valu1': 'XXXXX', 'initial value2': 'XXXXX', 'end valu2': 'XXXXX'}}\n```\n\nLet's prepare the final output.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value1\": \"0.00\", \"end valu1\": \"200359.99\", \"initial value2\": \"0.00\", \"end valu2\": \"5015020.00\"}}\n```",
