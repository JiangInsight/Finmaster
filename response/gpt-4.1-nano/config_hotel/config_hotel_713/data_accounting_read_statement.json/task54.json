This typically includes selling expenses, which directly relate to selling efforts, attracting customers, and delivering goods/services.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. **Identify the relevant expense categories**:  \n   - Costs directly associated with sales and delivery are usually classified under \"Selling Expenses.\"\n2. **Locate \"Selling Expenses\" in the income statement**:  \n   - In the provided income statement, \"Selling Expenses\" amount to 14714.68.\n3. **Confirm no other item more precisely matches the description**:  \n   - Administrative Expenses relate to general management, not directly to customer orders or delivery.\n   - Cost of Goods Sold is about production, not selling/delivery.\n   - Other expenses like financial expenses are unrelated.\n4. **Conclude**:  \n   - The expenses related to securing customer orders and delivering goods/services are best represented by the \"Selling Expenses.\"\n\nAnswer: **14714.68**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"14714.68\"}}\n```",
