These are the primary sources of income from core activities.\n\nGiven the data:\n- Main Business Revenue: 547392.30\n- Total Revenue: 547392.30\n\nIn most income statements, \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue\" reflect income from core operations.\n\nTherefore, the income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities is 547392.30.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"547392.30\"}}\n```",
