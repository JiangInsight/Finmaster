These items often appear in the investing or operating sections as increases or decreases in assets specifically categorized as assets held for sale.\n\nIn the provided cash flow statement, the key line item related to the reduction of such assets should be identified as a decrease or some indication that assets held for sale decreased during the period.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- The usual indicator would be a line mentioning assets held for sale or similar assets in the 'Investing Activities' section, or an indicator of a decrease in assets classified as held for sale.\n\nIn this case, the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is zero, and there's no explicit mention of assets held for sale in the statements.\n\nHowever, the main suspicion is the line in the \"Assets\" section, specifically the \"Ending Balance\" and \"Beginning Balance\" of Cash and Cash Equivalents, which don't directly reflect assets held for sale.\n\nGiven the absence of a direct line item, the best candidate for a reduction related to assets held for sale is the decrease seen in the inventory or other asset accounts.\n\nIn the first example, the decrease of -5090000.00 was the \"reduction in the amount of assets held for sale.\" Similarly, in the second example, the largest decrease appears in \"Decrease in Inventory\" of -7848830.00, which might be associated with assets being sold or reclassified.\n\nBut since the original question specifically asks for assets held for sale, in production, or in manufacturing, the most relevant line item in this data appears in the \"Decrease in Inventory.\"\n\nGiven that, the decrease in inventory of -7,848,830.00 is the most relevant figure representing a reduction in assets that could be classified as assets held for sale or in the process.\n\n**Therefore, the answer is -7848830.00.**\n\n---\n\n**Final answer in the required JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-7848830.00'}}\n```",
