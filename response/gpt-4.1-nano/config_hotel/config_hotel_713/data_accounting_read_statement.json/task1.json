These generally include:\n\n- Cash on Hand\n- Bank Deposits\n\nOther accounts like interest receivable, accounts receivable, and inventories are not considered liquid cash available for operational use in the same manner; they are receivables or assets.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Cash Holdings:**\n   - Cash on Hand: 3,000,000.00\n   - Bank Deposits: 5,000,000.00\n   - Total initial cash: 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000.00\n\n2. **Final Cash Holdings:**\n   - Cash on Hand: 2,179,154.14\n   - Bank Deposits: 2,952,150.00\n   - Total final cash: 2,179,154.14 + 2,952,150.00 = 5,131,304.14\n\nThis total reflects the liquid cash available at the start and end of the period.\n\n**Answer in the required JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '5131304.14'}}\n```",
