Since the task is to identify assets expected for sale or consumption in the normal operating cycle, these are generally excluded unless specifically intended for sale.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**  \n   The total current assets at the initial and end dates are the relevant line items for assets expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the operating cycle.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '13190375.83'}}\n```",
