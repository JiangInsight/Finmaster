                        "content": "Let's analyze the income statement step by step to identify the four specific line items:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**  \n    These are typically related to selling and administrative expenses but often are represented directly as specific costs related to sales. The most relevant line item appears to be **Selling Expenses** as these typically cover costs associated with securing customer orders and delivering goods/services.\n\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**  \n    This is usually represented explicitly as **Financial Expenses**.\n\n3. **The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**  \n    This refers to **Depreciation**.\n\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period**  \n    This is represented by **Tax Expense**.\n\nNow, extracting the corresponding values from the provided statement:\n\n- Selling Expenses: 14714.68\n- Financial Expenses: 2220.62\n- Depreciation: 91488.35\n- Tax Expense: 27369.63\n\nFinally, presenting the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '14714.68', 'value2': '2220.62', 'value3': '91488.35', 'value4': '27369.63'}}\n```",
