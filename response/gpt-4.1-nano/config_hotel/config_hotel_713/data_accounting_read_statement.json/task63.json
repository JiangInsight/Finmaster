Here, we focus on \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" which are typically investing activities.\n\n   - **Amounts of taxes accrued but not yet paid, and total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities:**\n\n     - Taxes accrued but not yet paid are shown as \"Tax Payable\" in the balance sheet.\n     - Total income arising in the course of ordinary activities is represented by \"Net Profit\" in the income statement.\n\n2. **Extract the required values from the input data:**\n\n   - **Value 1:** Cash flow from operating activities (cash generated from principal revenue-producing activities)  \n     From cash flow statement: `Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities`  \n     - First example: `-7259994.10`  \n     - Second example: `-2868695.86`  \n\n   - **Value 2:** The amount of activity that is not investing or financing (investing activity)  \n     - From cash flow statement: `Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities`  \n     - Both examples show: `-305354.43` and `-0.00`\n\n   - **Value 3:** Total income arising in the course of ordinary activities (Net Profit)  \n     - From income statement: `Net Profit`  \n     - First example: `-1645141.43`  \n     - Second example: `56497.85`\n\n   - **Additional info for clarity:**\n\n     - Taxes accrued but not yet paid: `Taxes Payable` in the balance sheet  \n       - First example: `271550.92`  \n       - Second example: `27369.63`\n\n3. **Matching with the output format:**\n\n   The task asks to identify and extract **three specific line items**:\n\n   1. The net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from principal activities (operating cash flow)  \n   2. The amount of other activities that are **not** investing or financing (investing activities)  \n   3. Total income arising in ordinary activities (net profit)\n\nBased on these, the final answer will include:\n\n- `value1`: cash flow from operating activities  \n- `value2`: net cash flow from investing activities  \n- `value3`: net profit\n\n---\n\n## Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '-7259994.10', 'value2': '-305354.43', 'value3': '-1645141.43'}}\n```",
