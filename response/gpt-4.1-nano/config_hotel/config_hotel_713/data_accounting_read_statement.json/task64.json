                        "content": "Let's analyze each part step by step.\n\n**1. From the Balance Sheet**, identify the three specific line items:\n\n- End value of profit/loss before tax expense:\n  - Profit before tax is a common line item.\n  - From the balance sheet, note that \"Retained Earnings\" is a component of equity, but the line item similar to profit before tax isn't explicitly listed in the balance sheet here.\n  - However, given typical structure, the profit before tax is recorded in the income statement, not the balance sheet.\n  - The balance sheet shows \"Total Owner's Equity\" but not the profit before tax directly.\n\n- The required items are:\n  - Profit or loss before tax (from the income statement): **Profit Before Tax** = -1373590.51\n  - Addition to the amount owed for goods/services received or purchased on credit during the period:\n    - This is represented by \"Accounts Payable\" (liability for credit purchases)\n    - End amount of Accounts Payable = 5,015,020.00\n  - Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares:\n    - Usually the \"Paid-in Capital\"\n    - End amount of Paid-in Capital = 16,000,000.00\n\n**2. From the Income Statement**, identify the three specific line items:\n\n- Profit/loss before tax (already noted above): **-1373590.51**\n- Addition in the amount owed by the entity (accounts for credit purchase): **Accounts Payable at end = 5,015,020.00**\n- Capital contributed by shareholders: **Paid-in Capital = 16,000,000.00**\n\n**3. From the Cash Flow Statement**, identify similarly the items if needed:\n\n- The instruction groups by statements, so the answers are in the three specific line items per statement.\n\n---\n\n**Final extracted answers:**\n\n- **Balance Sheet:**\n  1. Profit or loss before tax (from income statement) → **-1373590.51**\n  2. Addition in the amount owed for goods/services (Accounts Payable) → **5,015,020.00**\n  3. Capital contributed by shareholders (Paid-in Capital) → **16,000,000.00**\n\n- **Income Statement:**\n  Same set, since the items are directly available:\n  1. Profit or loss before tax → **-1373590.51**\n  2. Addition in the amount owed (here, total accounts payable after period) → **5,015,020.00**\n  3. Capital contributed by shareholders (Paid-in Capital) → **16,000,000.00**\n\n- **Cash Flow Statement:**\n  - The cash flow statement’s relevant line items are:\n    1. Profit before tax is equal to Net Profit (for cash flow purposes) → **56,497.85**\n    2. Increase in amount owed by the entity for goods/services (Accounts Payable change):\n       - Beginning Accounts Payable not given, Ending Accounts Payable: 5,015,020.00\n       - Change: Since beginning isn't provided, take the ending as the figure\n    3. Capital contributed by shareholders (Paid-in Capital remain same): **16,000,000.00**\n\n  - The net profit in the cash flow: 56,497.85\n  - The amount owed (accounts payable): 5,015,020.00\n  - Capital contributed: 16,000,000.00\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value1\": \"-1373590.51\",\n    \"value2\": \"5015020.00\",\n    \"value3\": \"16000000.00\"\n  }\n}\n```",
