The total income from ordinary activities (commonly the \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue\").\n2. The carrying amount of inventories sold during the period (\"Cost of Goods Sold\").\n3. The costs related to the general management and administration of the entity (\"Administrative Expenses\").\n\n### Step 2: Locate the Values in the Provided Data\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 547392.30 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Revenue | 547392.30 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 353220.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 11762.87 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThe \"Total Revenue\" and \"Main Business Revenue\" are the same; therefore, either can be taken as total income. The \"Main Business Revenue\" is the primary indicator of income arising from the entity's normal operations.\n\n### Step 3: Final Selection\n- **Total income arising from ordinary activities:** \"Main Business Revenue\" = 547392.30\n- **Carrying amount of inventories sold:** \"Cost of Goods Sold\" = 353220.00\n- **Costs of general management and administration:** \"Administrative Expenses\" = 11762.87\n\n### Step 4: Prepare the JSON output\nMaintain the order as specified.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '547392.30', 'value2': '353220.00', 'value3': '11762.87'}}\n```",
