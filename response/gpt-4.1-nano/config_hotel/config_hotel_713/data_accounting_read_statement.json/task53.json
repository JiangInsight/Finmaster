                        "content": "To find the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, we need to analyze the relevant financial statement data, primarily the income statement and balance sheet.\n\nStep 1: Identify the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).  \nFrom the income statement, the COGS is listed as 353220.00.\n\nStep 2: Check the inventory balances at the beginning and end of the period.  \nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning inventory (Initial_amount at 2023-12-31): 0.00\n- Ending inventory (End_amount at 2024-02-05): 7848830.00\n\nStep 3: Calculate the inventory sold during the period.  \nSince the beginning inventory was zero, the inventory sold would be the sum of COGS plus the change in inventory during the period.\n\nIn standard inventory accounting, the formula is:\n\nInventory Sold = Beginning Inventory + Purchases During Period - Ending Inventory\n\nHowever, since beginning inventory is zero, the inventory purchased during the period is effectively the change in inventory plus COGS.\n\nAlternatively, given the data:\n\n- Ending inventory = 7,848,830.00\n- COGS = 353,220.00\n- Beginning inventory = 0.00\n\nSince we don't have explicit purchase data, but the inventory increased significantly, and COGS relates to the inventory sold, the most straightforward interpretation is:\n\n**Carrying amount of inventories sold = COGS = 353,220.00**\n\nBecause the inventory at the end (7,848,830) suggests the company purchased or produced additional inventory during the period, but the question asks specifically for the \"carrying amount of inventories sold,\" which is directly given by COGS in the income statement.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"353220.00\"}}",
