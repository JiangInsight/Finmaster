In the provided balance sheets, we observe:\n\n- For the first statement, \"Bank Deposits\" at the end amount is 1,642,450.00\n- For the second statement, \"Bank Deposits\" at the end amount is 2,952,150.00\n\nSince the task asks for the *end value* of funds deposited into a bank, the logical choice for the current data set is the \"Bank Deposits\" account's end amount.\n\n**Line Item 2: Income earned by an entity from financial assets**\n\nIncome from financial assets is usually labeled as \"Interest Income\" or similar on the income statement, reflecting earnings from deposits, investments, etc.\n\n- First statement: \"Interest Income\" at 2,672.87\n- Second statement: \"Interest Income\" at 9,881.70\n\nChoosing the second statement (latest data), the interest income earned from financial assets is 9,881.70.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. **Identify the deposit into the bank** – from the balance sheets, the \"Bank Deposits\" at the end is the relevant line item.\n2. **Identify income earned from financial assets** – from the income statements, the \"Interest Income\" line item reflects this revenue.\n\n---\n\n## Final answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"2952150.00\", \"value2\": \"9881.70\"}}\n```",
