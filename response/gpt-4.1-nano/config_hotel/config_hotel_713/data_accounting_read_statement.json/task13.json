Examine the line items under total assets.\n2. Identify line items related to non-current assets.\n3. Confirm the initial and ending values for these non-current assets.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n\n- Fixed Assets at initial: 8,000,000.00; and ending: 8,000,000.00.\n- Accumulated Depreciation (a contra asset) is not a separate asset to consider as a non-current asset.\n- Total Non-current Assets at initial: 8,000,000.00; ending: 7,908,511.65.\n\nThe key line item is \"Total Non-current Assets\" since it encompasses assets not expected to be realized or used up within the operating cycle.\n\nTherefore, the initial and final values of total non-current assets are:\n\n- Initial value: 8,000,000.00\n- End value: 7,908,511.65\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"7908511.65\"}}\n```",
