The account \"Accounts Payable\" indicates amounts owed by the entity for credit purchases.\n2. The initial amount for \"Accounts Payable\" is 0.00, meaning no outstanding payable at the start date.\n3. The end amount for \"Accounts Payable\" is 5,015,020.00, representing the total amount owed at the end date.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item of interest is \"Accounts Payable,\" with an initial value of 0.00 and a final value of 5,015,020.00.\n\nFinal answer formatted as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"5015020.00\"}}\n```",
