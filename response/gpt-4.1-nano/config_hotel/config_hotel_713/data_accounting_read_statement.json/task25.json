Identify expenses directly related to sales and delivery: \"Selling Expenses\" is the most straightforward line item.  \n2. Review other expenses: \"Cost of Goods Sold\" relates to production, not securing or delivering orders.  \n3. Depreciation and financial expenses are generally not considered direct costs of order securing or delivery.  \n4. Therefore, the primary cost item to focus on is \"Selling Expenses\".\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value for \"Selling Expenses\" is 14714.68.\n\n**Final answer in JSON format:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '14714.68'} }\n```",
