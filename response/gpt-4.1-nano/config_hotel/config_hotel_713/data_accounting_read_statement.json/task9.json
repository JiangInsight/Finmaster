The account “Taxes Payable” indicates taxes that are accrued but not yet paid.\n2. Initial value of Taxes Payable = 0.00 (at 2023-12-31)\n3. End value of Taxes Payable = 27369.63 (at 2024-02-05)\n\nThus, the initial value of taxes accrued but not paid is zero, and the final amount of taxes accrued but not paid (but not yet settled) is 27,369.63.\n\nAnswer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '27369.63'}}\n```",
