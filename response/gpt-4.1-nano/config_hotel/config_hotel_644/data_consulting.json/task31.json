                        "content": "Let's proceed step by step to calculate each required financial ratio.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover = Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n**Data:**  \n- Revenue = 836,813.79  \n- Accounts Receivable at start = 0.00  \n- Accounts Receivable at end = 335,639.38\n\n**Calculation:**  \nAverage Accounts Receivable = (0 + 335,639.38) / 2 = 167,819.69\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover = 836,813.79 / 167,819.69 ≈ 4.99\n\n---\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities = Net Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nNote:  \n- Net cash flow from operating activities = -1,919,526.63  \n- Current liabilities at end = 5,637,910.70\n\nCalculation:  \nRatio = -1,919,526.63 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ -0.34\n\n---\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Operating Cash Flow / Total Current Assets\n\n- Net Operating Cash Flow = -1,919,526.63  \n- Total Current Assets = 10,453,882.43\n\nCalculation:  \nRatio = -1,919,526.63 / 10,453,882.43 ≈ -0.18\n\n---\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average Total Assets\n\n**Data:**  \n- Revenue = 836,813.79  \n- Total Assets at start = 21,737,442.99  \n- Total Assets at end = 21,737,442.99\n\n**(Since only end value is given, assume initial = end, or calculate using the same end as average for simplicity)**\n\nAverage Total Assets = (16,000,000 + 21,737,442.99) / 2 ≈ 18,868,721.50\n\nTotal Asset Turnover = 836,813.79 / 18,868,721.50 ≈ 0.0443\n\n---\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity = Total Liabilities / Shareholders' Equity\n\n**Data:**  \n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities + Non-current liabilities (implied by Total Assets - Equity)  \n- Since liabilities are:  \n  - Accounts Payable = 5,596,070.00  \n  - Taxes Payable = 41,840.70  \n- Total liabilities = 5,637,910.70 (current liabilities) + (Total Assets - Total Liabilities and Equity)  \n- Owner’s Equity at end = 16,099,532.29\n\nTotal liabilities (to check) = Total Assets - Equity  \n= 21,737,442.99 - 16,099,532.29 ≈ 5,637,910.70\n\nSo, total liabilities = 5,637,910.70 (which matches total liabilities provided)\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 5,637,910.70 / 16,099,532.29 ≈ 0.35\n\n---\n\n### Final compiled results:\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"4.99\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-0.18\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.34\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.044\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.35\"\n  }\n}\n```",
