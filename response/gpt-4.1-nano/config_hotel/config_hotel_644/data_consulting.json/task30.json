                        "content": "Let's analyze each metric step by step based on the provided data:\n\n**1. Current Ratio**\n\n- Current Assets (End Amount): 10,453,882.43  \n- Current Liabilities (End Amount): 5,637,910.70  \n\nCurrent Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities = 10,453,882.43 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ 1.86\n\n**2. Quick Ratio**\n\nQuick Assets include Cash, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, and Accounts Receivable.\n\n- Cash on Hand: 2,105,753.37  \n- Bank Deposits: 559,055.66  \n- Interest Receivable: 6,494.02  \n- Accounts Receivable: 335,639.38  \n\nQuick Assets = 2,105,753.37 + 559,055.66 + 6,494.02 + 335,639.38 = 3,006,942.43\n\nQuick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities = 3,006,942.43 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ 0.53\n\n**3. Debt to Asset Ratio**\n\n- Total Liabilities = Current Liabilities + Long-term Liabilities (if any). In this case, only current liabilities are provided; assuming no long-term liabilities are given, total liabilities = 5,637,910.70.\n- Total Assets: 21,737,442.99\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets = 5,637,910.70 / 21,737,442.99 ≈ 0.26\n\n**4. Debt to Equity Ratio**\n\n- Owner's Equity = 16,099,532.29\n- Total Debt (Liabilities) = 5,637,910.70\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Owner's Equity = 5,637,910.70 / 16,099,532.29 ≈ 0.35\n\n**5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,919,526.63\n- Total Debt (Liabilities) = 5,637,910.70\n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow / Total Debt = -1,919,526.63 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ -0.34\n\n---\n\n**Final answer in specified JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Current Ratio\": \"1.86\",\n  \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.53\",\n  \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.26\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.35\",\n  \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.34\"\n}}\n```",
