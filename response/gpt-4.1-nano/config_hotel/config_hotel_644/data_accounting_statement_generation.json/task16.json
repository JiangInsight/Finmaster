                        "content": "Let's analyze the data step-by-step:\n\n1. The main concept here is \"paid-in capital,\" which is the amount invested into the company by shareholders through the initial contribution and subsequent contributions.\n\n2. The initial recorded amounts show:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00\n- Total initial paid-in capital = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.00\n\n3. For final amounts, we need to see any contributions or withdrawals that affect paid-in capital after initial recording.\n\n4. In the provided data, the initial amount (recorded at the start) appears to be the sum of the first three assets, totaling 13 million, which is a typical initial paid-in capital entry.\n\n5. No subsequent transaction shows additional capital contributions or reductions in paid-in capital â€” only transactions involving asset acquisitions, sales, expenses, and receivables.\n\n6. Therefore, the initial and final paid-in capital should remain the same unless new capital contributions are explicitly recorded.\n\n7. Based on the given data, the initial paid-in capital is 13,000,000.00, and there is no evidence indicating any change to this amount.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Initial paid-in capital = 13,000,000.00\n- Final paid-in capital = 13,000,000.00\n\nHere's the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"13000000.00\", \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"13000000.00\"}}\n```",
