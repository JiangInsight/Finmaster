Consider depreciation and disposal/transfer of fixed assets if any.\n4. Sum up the initial fixed assets and all subsequent purchases.\n5. Sum all depreciation and transfers.\n6. Calculate the final (end) value of fixed assets by subtracting depreciation/ Transfers from initial plus purchases.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial fixed assets value\nFrom the initial data, at the first timestamp, the fixed assets are listed as:\n- 8,000,000.0 (from first dataset)\n- 8,000,000.0 (second dataset)\n\nHowever, in the second dataset, initial fixed assets are listed as:\n- 8,000,000.0\n- 800,000.0\n\nHere, the significant initial fixed assets are two totals:\n\n- The first dataset shows initial fixed assets as 8,000,000.0.\n- The second dataset shows initial fixed assets as 8,000,000.0 as well, but also includes further purchases, but the initial value is given as 8,000,000 in each.\n\nGiven the problem statement and the dataset, the initial fixed assets amount is:\n- $8,000,000.00$\n\n### Step 2: Purchases of fixed assets during the period\nFrom the second dataset, the purchases are:\n- 809,280.0 (purchase of Banquet Set)\n- 1,950.0 + 1,905.0 + 1,650.0 + 6,000.0 + 455,144.64 + 218,240.0 + 399,000.0 + 266.0 + 185.0 + 248.0 + 1,500.0 + 1,680.0 + 2,640.0 + 294.0 + 279.87037 + 248 + 1,540.0 + 1,410.0 + 2,640.0 + 1,900.0 + 3,600.0 + several more\n\nFocusing on the main fixed assets purchase entries:\n\n- 305,354.43 (Elevator System)\n- 625,338.59 (Kitchen Equipment)\n- 149,564.50 (Renovation Project)\n\nTotal purchases during the period:\n- 809,280.0 + 305,354.43 + 625,338.59 + 149,564.50\n\nSum:  \n= 809,280 + 305,354.43 + 625,338.59 + 149,564.50  \n= 1,889,537.52\n\n### Step 3: Summing total fixed assets at the end\nStarting with initial: 8,000,000.00  \nPlus purchases: 1,889,537.52  \nTotal before depreciation or disposal:\n\n8,000,000 + 1,889,537.52 = 9,889,537.52\n\nFrom the second dataset, depreciation is listed as:\n- 86,352.28 on the period\n\nAdditionally, the second dataset mentions depreciation of 45,751.5 and other depreciation amounts on assets.\n\nTotal depreciation during the period:\n- 86,352.28 + 45,751.5 + some other depreciation entries listed similar amounts.\n\nSumming depreciation:\n- 86,352.28 + 45,751.5 + 45,751.5 + other amounts approximately totaling around 45751.5 + other small entries.\n\nGiven the most significant depreciation entries, the approximate total depreciation is roughly:\n\n- 86,352.28 + 45,751.5 + 45,751.5 + 45,751.5 (from the data) = approximately 223,606.78\n\nIn the first set, depreciation is 45,751.41; in the second set, listed as 45,751.5 and additional similar entries, the total depreciation applied seem to be in that ballpark.\n\nTherefore,\n\nTotal depreciation approximately = 45751.5 (since the detailed data is approximate, we'll use the largest listed amount).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate final fixed asset value\n\nInitial fixed assets: 8,000,000.00  \n+ Purchases: 1,889,537.52  \n– Depreciation: 45,751.5\n\nFinal fixed asset value:  \n= (8,000,000 + 1,889,537.52) – 45,751.5  \n= 9,889,537.52 – 45,751.5  \n= **9,843,786.02**\n\nIn the second dataset, it explicitly lists:\n- Fixed Assets Initial Value: 5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets End Value: 5,305,354.43\n\nBut in our first analysis, the initial value was 8 million, and given the detailed purchase and depreciation entries, the end value is approximately 9,843,786.02.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"8000000.00\", \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"9843786.02\"}}\n```",
