From the provided data, look for all entries related to depreciation. \n\n3. There are several depreciation entries across different datasets, for example:\n   - On 2024-01-01, there is a depreciation of 45751.41 (from the first dataset).\n   - On 2024-01-01, another depreciation of 45751.5 appears.\n   - On 2024-01-01, a depreciation of 45751.5 is also recorded in the second dataset.\n   - On 2024-02-01, there is a depreciation of 86352.28 (from the last dataset).\n\n4. We need to determine which depreciation is the last (final) depreciation in chronological order, as it would be the final depreciation item in the cash flow statement.\n\n5. Chronologically, the latest depreciation recorded is on 2024-02-01, with an amount of 86352.28.\n\n6. The previous depreciation records on 2024-01-01 are earlier; the 2024-02-01 depreciation is the latest in the dataset.\n\nTherefore, the final depreciation item in the cash flow statement is 86352.28.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '86352.28'} }\n```",
