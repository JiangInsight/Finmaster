The fixed assets are paid and thus not liabilities.\n- The initial total liabilities are only the unpaid purchase: **290,000.0**\n\n**Step 2: Summarize initial liabilities**\n\n- Initial unpaid liabilities:\n  - Purchase to Supplier S002: 290,000.0\n\n- **Initial total current liabilities:** 290,000.0\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Determine final liabilities**\n\n- We need to look for unpaid current liabilities as of the latest date in the dataset (most recent date is 2024-02-01).\n\n- From the latest transactions, identify unpaid liabilities:\n\n  - On 2024-02-01:\n    - Sale20240201108, 3933.09 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n    - Sale20240201109, 660.27 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n  - These are receivables (assets), not liabilities, so ignore.\n\n- Other unpaid liabilities include:\n  - Purchase S002 (Unpaid): 558,000.0\n  - Purchase S004 (Unpaid): 44850.0\n  - Purchase S002 (Unpaid): 1470000.0\n  - Purchase S009 (Unpaid): 220,000.0\n  - Purchase S006 (Unpaid): 19,050.0\n  - Purchase S002 (Unpaid): 596,000.0\n  - Purchase S009 (Unpaid): 399,000.0\n  - Purchase S004 (Unpaid): 700,000.0\n\n- Summing unpaid purchase liabilities as of latest:\n\n  - 558,000.0\n  - 44,850.0\n  - 1,470,000.0\n  - 220,000.0\n  - 19,050.0\n  - 596,000.0\n  - 399,000.0\n  - 700,000.0\n\nTotal unpaid current liabilities (latest):\n\n- 558,000 + 44,850 + 1,470,000 + 220,000 + 19,050 + 596,000 + 399,000 + 700,000 = 4,006,900.0\n\n**Note:** No other liabilities such as unpaid expenses or interest receivables are considered liabilities (they are assets).\n\n**Final liability amount = total unpaid purchase liabilities**: 4,006,900.0\n\n**Step 4: Prepare answer in JSON format**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Liabilities Initial Value': '290000.00', 'Total Current Liabilities End Value': '4006900.00'}}\n```",
