The goal is to identify the expense line items from the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, focusing on initial and final values.\n\n2. In the given table, the main expense-related account is \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" which typically records depreciation expense over time. The change in accumulated depreciation from initial to end value represents depreciation expense incurred during the period.\n\n3. Initial value of \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is 0.00 (at 2023-12-31).\n\n4. Final value of \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is 132,103.78 (at 2024-02-01).\n\n5. The difference is 132,103.78 - 0.00 = 132,103.78, which indicates the depreciation expense for the period.\n\n6. No other expense accounts are explicitly listed, so based on the available data, the primary recognized expense here is depreciation.\n\nTherefore, the extracted expense is depreciation, with initial value 0.00 and final value 132,103.78.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '132103.78'}}\n```",
