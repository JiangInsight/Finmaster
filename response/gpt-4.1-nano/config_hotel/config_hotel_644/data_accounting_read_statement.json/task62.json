Since the instruction is to extract from all financial statements, and the highest-level item indicating the outflow for property and equipment is **Purchase of Fixed Assets** recorded there, we take that.\n\n### Income Statement:\n- The specific interest cost or financing costs are shown as **Financial Expenses** in the income statement.\n\n### Cash Flow Statement:\n- The actual cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment are shown in **Purchase of Fixed Assets**.\n\n---\n\n**Final extracted values:**\n\n- Line item for amounts owed to the entity for goods or services: **Accounts Receivable** (value: 335639.38)\n- Financing costs to raise funds: **Financial Expenses** (value: 2675.27)\n- Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment: **Purchase of Fixed Assets** (value: 3415664.34)\n\n---\n\n**Final JSON output:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"335639.38\", \"value2\": \"2675.27\", \"value3\": \"3415664.34\"}}\n```",
