                        "content": "Let's analyze the given data step by step to identify the three specific line items:\n\n1. Cash held by the entity available for use in operations:  \n   - This includes cash on hand and bank deposits, which are typically liquid assets used for daily operations.  \n   - From the table:\n     - Cash on Hand: initial = 3,000,000.00; end = 2,105,753.37\n     - Bank Deposits: initial = 5,000,000.00; end = 559,055.66\n\n2. Tangible items held for use in production, supply of goods/services, rental, or administrative purposes:  \n   - This is generally represented by inventory or fixed assets.  \n   - Inventory (though it might also include supplies) is a tangible current asset for operations: initial = 0.00; end = 7,446,940.00  \n   - Fixed assets are long-term tangible assets: initial = 8,000,000.00; end = 11,415,664.34  \n   - Since the task refers to general tangible items for use, it may include inventory and fixed assets.  \n   - But based on the task context, focusing on inventory makes more sense as current tangible items used in operations.\n\n3. Amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid (initial and final):  \n   - This corresponds to taxes payable.  \n   - From the table:\n     - Taxes Payable: initial = 0.00; end = 41,840.70\n\nNow, to finalize the output, we will follow the original line item order in the input and select the specific line items:\n\n- For cash: sum \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" (since both are used in operations).  \n- For tangible items: \"Inventory\" (since it directly relates to goods for supply) and \"Fixed Assets\" (long-term tangible assets).  \n- For tax accrued but not yet paid: \"Taxes Payable.\"\n\nHowever, the instruction suggests selecting three specific line items and their values. Given the example, it appears they pick three key items:\n\nFrom the instructions and example, it appears they select individual line items rather than summing multiple items unless explicitly desired.\n\nIn the example, they pick:\n\n- Cash on Hand (initial and end)\n- Bank Deposits (initial and end)\n- Interest Receivable (initial and end) â€” this is a receivable, not cash, so likely not included here.\n\nIn the second example, they select:\n\n- Cash on Hand\n- Bank Deposits\n- Taxes Payable\n\nThis pattern suggests selecting: the cash accounts, the tangible assets (likely inventory or fixed assets), and taxes payable.\n\nBased on this pattern, the three selected line items are:\n\n1. Cash on Hand (initial and end)\n2. Bank Deposits (initial and end)\n3. Taxes Payable (initial and end)\n\nWhile the prompt mentions tangible items that are held for use, the example indicates focusing on the tracking of cash and tax items with the additions of other relevant items.\n\nGiven this, I will select:\n\n- Initial and final values for \"Cash on Hand\" (cash)\n- Initial and final values for \"Bank Deposits\" (cash)\n- Initial and final values for \"Taxes Payable\" (taxes)\n\nThis aligns with the example provided and the task's focus.\n\n---\n\n### Final extracted values:\n\n- **initial value1:** '3000000.00'\n- **end value1:** '2105753.37'\n- **initial value2:** '5000000.00'\n- **end value2:** '559055.66'\n- **initial value3:** '0.00'\n- **end value3:** '41840.70'\n\n---\n\n### Final output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '3000000.00', 'end valu1': '2105753.37', 'initial value2': '5000000.00', 'end valu2': '559055.66', 'initial value3': '0.00', 'end valu3': '41840.70'} }\n```",
