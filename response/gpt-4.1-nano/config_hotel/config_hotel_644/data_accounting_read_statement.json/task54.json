Since the explicit instruction is to extract the specific line item and value, and both are relevant, the best approach is to indicate the total or specify the key relevant line.\n\nConsidering the example provided, where only one line item was selected, I will follow the same logic and select the \"Selling Expenses\", as it directly relates to securing customer orders.\n\n**Chosen line item**: Selling Expenses\n\n**Value**: 8884.87\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8884.87'} }\n```",
