The taxes payable in the balance sheet reflect the amount owed at the period's end, which can include accrued taxes from previous periods or current period taxes.\n\nStep 4: Since the task explicitly asks for the amount of total tax expected to pay or recover in the reporting period, the relevant figure is the \"Tax Expense\" from the income statement, as it reflects taxes incurred during the period.\n\nTherefore, for the provided problem, the key figure is the \"Tax Expense\" of 41,840.70.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"41840.70\"}}\n```",
