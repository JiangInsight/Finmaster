Typically, these would include inventory, or specific line items explicitly mentioning assets held for sale.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Review the line items for amounts related to inventory or similar assets.\n2. The relevant line item here is \"Inventory\" â€” since inventory is often held for sale in the ordinary course of business unless otherwise specified.\n3. Initial inventory value is 0.00, and final is 7,446,940.00 as of 2024-02-01, indicating production or accumulation in progress for sale.\n\nTherefore, the assets held for sale (specifically inventory) are the initial and final values:\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- Final value: 7,446,940.00\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '7446940.00'}}\n```",
