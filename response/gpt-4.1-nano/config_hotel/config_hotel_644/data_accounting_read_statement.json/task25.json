In this context, the most relevant line item appears to be \"Selling Expenses\" as it generally encompasses costs related to securing customer orders (such as sales commissions, advertising, and other sales-related costs) and delivery.\n\nIn the provided income statement, \"Selling Expenses\" is listed as 8,884.87 on 2024-02-01.\n\nTherefore, the line item and value for costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services are:\n\n- \"Selling Expenses\" with an amount of 8,884.87.\n\nNow, formulating the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"8884.87\"}}\n```",
