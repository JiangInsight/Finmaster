Total income arising in the course of the entity's ordinary activities (equivalent to \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue\")\n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period (\"Cost of Goods Sold\")\n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole (\"Administrative Expenses\")\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n- The line item for total income arising from ordinary activities is typically \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue\". Here, \"Main Business Revenue\" is more specific, so we'll use that.\n- The carrying amount of inventories sold during the period is given directly as \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n- The costs of general management and administration are represented by \"Administrative Expenses\".\n\nExtracted values from the input:\n\n- Main Business Revenue: 836813.79\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 544970.00\n- Administrative Expenses: 13300.90\n\nNow, format these into the required JSON structure, maintaining the order as per the problem statement:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '836813.79', 'value2': '544970.00', 'value3': '13300.90'}}\n```",
