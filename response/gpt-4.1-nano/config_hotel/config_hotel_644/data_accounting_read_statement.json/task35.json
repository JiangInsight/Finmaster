Costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services:\n   - These are typically categorized under \"Cost of Goods Sold\" or \"Selling Expenses\" or \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n   - In this context, since we're asked for costs to secure orders and deliver goods/services, \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (which relates to production/delivery) is the most appropriate.\n\n2. Financing costs incurred to raise funds:\n   - Typically represented by \"Financial Expenses.\"\n\n3. Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount over its useful life:\n   - This is \"Depreciation.\"\n\n4. Total taxes expected to pay or recover during the reporting period:\n   - Refers to \"Tax Expense.\"\n\nNow, extracting these line items from the given data:\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 544970.00\n- Financial Expenses: 2675.27\n- Depreciation: 132103.78\n- Tax Expense: 41840.70\n\nEnsure matching the original order of the outputs as per task instructions.\n\nFinal answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '544970.00', 'value2': '2675.27', 'value3': '132103.78', 'value4': '41840.70'}}\n```",
