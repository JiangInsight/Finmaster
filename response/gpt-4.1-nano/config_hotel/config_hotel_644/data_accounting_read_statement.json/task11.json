Initial Retained Earnings = 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n2. End Retained Earnings = 99,532.29 (as of 2024-02-01)\n3. The change in Retained Earnings over this period is 99,532.29 - 0.00 = 99,532.29\n\nThis positive change indicates the entity retained a profit of 99,532.29 during the period, which was not distributed to shareholders.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '99532.29'}}\n```",
