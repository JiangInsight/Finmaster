The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period:\n   - This is typically represented by the change in accounts payable, which reflects liabilities incurred for purchases on credit.\n   - In the table, this is \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\", which is **5596070.00**.\n\n2. The acquisition of property, plant, and equipment:\n   - This is usually reflected under investing activities with line items like \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n   - From the table, this is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\", amounting to **3415664.34**.\n\n3. The cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period:\n   - This is explicitly labeled as \"Beginning Balance\" under cash and cash equivalents.\n   - The value given is **8000000.00**.\n\nFollowing the instructions, we maintain the original order of the line items as they appear.\n\n**Therefore**, the answers are:\n\n- Value 1: Accounts payable increase = 5596070.00\n- Value 2: Purchase of fixed assets = 3415664.34\n- Value 3: Beginning cash balance = 8000000.00\n\nNow, providing the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5596070.00', 'value2': '3415664.34', 'value3': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
