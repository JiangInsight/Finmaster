                        "content": "Let's analyze the cash flow statement data step-by-step to identify the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and investments, as well as receipt of interest and dividends. This corresponds to the \"cash flows from investing activities\" that are not included in cash equivalents.\n\n**Step 1: Locate \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\"**  \nFrom the data:  \n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 3,415,664.34  \n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -3,415,664.34\n\nThis net figure represents the total cash used in investing activities, which typically includes acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and investments, but only the net amount is provided in the statement.\n\n**Step 2: Break down the components under \"Investing Activities\"**  \nIn common financial statements, investing activities include:  \n- Purchases of fixed assets (outflows)  \n- Proceeds from sale of assets (inflows)  \n- Purchase or sale of investments (not directly shown here but could be part of activities)  \n- Receipt of interest and dividends (often included separately)\n\nIn the provided data, physical details on proceeds from sale of assets or securities are not given explicitly. The only relevant line item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which is an outflow.\n\n**Step 3: Decompose the net investing cash flow**  \nSince the question asks for the net amount \"generated\" from the acquisition and disposal of assets and investments, I interpret this as the net cash flows from these activities.\n\n- The \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = 3,415,664.34 (cash outflow).  \n- No proceeds from sales or other investments are listed, so we assume no inflows.\n\n- Receipt of interest and dividends is usually reported separately; here, no specific cash receipts of interest/dividends are indicated in \"investing activities.\" Therefore, we do not have explicit data on interest/dividends here.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n- The overall net cash flow from investing activities is -3,415,664.34, which is primarily due to the purchase of fixed assets.\n\n- Since no other inflows or receipts are specified, and the question asks for the net amount generated, the value stands at -3,415,664.34.\n\n- Decomposition into sub-items can be done, but only the purchase of fixed assets is explicitly given as a sub-item.\n\n**Step 4: Sub-items**  \n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: -3,415,664.34  \n- Other investments or receipts are not available, so only this sub-item is provided.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-3415664.34\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value\": \"-3415664.34\"}}}\n```",
