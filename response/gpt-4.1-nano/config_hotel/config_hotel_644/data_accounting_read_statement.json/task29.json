Identify the total income arising from the entity's ordinary activities:  \n   - It is represented by \"Total Revenue\".\n\n2. Extract the value of \"Total Revenue\" and its associated line item:  \n   - \"Total Revenue\" = 836813.79\n\n3. Decompose this total income into sub-items.  \n   - The primary component sub-item is the \"Main Business Revenue\".  \n   - It's reasonable to assume that \"Main Business Revenue\" is a major part of \"Total Revenue\".\n\n4. Extract the value of \"Main Business Revenue\":  \n   - 836813.79 (matching \"Total Revenue\", implying it's the main component).\n\n5. Since the problem asks for one component sub-item derived from the total income, and both \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\" are directly linked, the main sub-item is \"Main Business Revenue\" with its value.\n\n---\n\n**Final output:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"836813.79\", \"sub_item value\": \"836813.79\"}}\n```",
