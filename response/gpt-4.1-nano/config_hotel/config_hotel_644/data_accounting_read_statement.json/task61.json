Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers.\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\n### Step 1: Find costs to secure customer orders and to deliver goods/services\n\n- These costs are typically categorized as **selling expenses**, **administrative expenses**, or **cost of goods sold** in the income statement.\n- \"Costs incurred to secure customer orders\" generally relate to **Selling Expenses**.\n- \"Costs to deliver goods and services\" are often included in **Cost of Goods Sold** or **Selling Expenses**, depending on classification.\n\nIn this context:\n\n- The line item \"Selling Expenses\" (from the income statements) directly relates to costs to secure customer orders.\n- For the costs to deliver the goods/services, the most relevant is the **Cost of Goods Sold**.\n\nGiven the task specifies \"the two line items\" and the example aligns with \"selling expenses\" and \"cost of goods sold,\" we should select:\n\n- **Selling Expenses** as the first item.\n- **Cost of Goods Sold** as the second item.\n\n### Step 2: Find the costs to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets\n\n- These are **cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets**.\n- These cash flows are shown under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nIn the cash flow statements provided:\n\n- The line \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" reflects cash paid to acquire property, plant, and equipment.\n\n### Final selection:\n\n- From the income statements:\n  - Selling Expenses: 493,854.67 (from first problem)\n  - Cost of Goods Sold: 4,410,000.00 (from first problem)\n  \n- From the cash flow statements:\n  - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 3,045,354.43 (from first problem)\n\n### Therefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"493854.67\", \"value2\": \"3045354.43\"}}\n```\n\n(Note: The formatting of the second value should be consistent with the format presented in the data â€” typically, as a string. Also, the second value is from the cash flow statement, \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\")",
