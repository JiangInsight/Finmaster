                        "content": "Let's analyze the given cash flow statement step by step:\n\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life:**  \n   This refers to depreciation, which is explicitly listed as \"Depreciation\" with an amount of 132103.78.\n\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale during the period:**  \n   This change involves assets classified as held for sale, in production, or being manufactured.  \n   The relevant line is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an amount of 3415664.34.  \n   Although \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" usually indicates acquisition, in the context of cash flow, reduction in assets held for sale may be reflected as a decrease, but here, since the primary related line in cash flows is purchases or disposals, the net change in assets held for sale often appears as an increase or decrease in fixed assets.\n\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities related to the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and investments, not included in cash equivalents, plus receipt of interest and dividends:**  \n   This corresponds to cash flows from investing activities, which are \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" of -3,415,664.34.\n\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period:**  \n   This is the net change in cash and cash equivalents, listed as \"Net Increase\" of -5,335,190.97.\n\n**Final extracted values in order:**\n- Value1 (depreciation): 132103.78\n- Value2 (reduction in assets held for sale or related assets: asset disposal or assets in production): 3415664.34\n- Value3 (cash flows from activities involving long-term assets/investments): -3415664.34\n- Value4 (net change in cash and cash equivalents): -5335190.97\n\n---\n\n**Answer in the required JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '132103.78', 'value2': '3415664.34', 'value3': '-3415664.34', 'value4': '-5335190.97'} }\n```",
