From the table, the relevant account is \"Taxes Payable\".\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the account associated with accrued but unpaid taxes: \"Taxes Payable\".\n2. Note the initial amount at the start date: 0.00.\n3. Note the end amount at the end date: 41840.70.\n4. Since the initial value was zero and the final value is non-zero, this indicates that tax expenses accrued during the period but were not paid yet.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and value of tax accrued but not yet paid are:\n\n- Initial Value: 0.00\n- Final Value: 41840.70\n\nNow, presenting in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"41840.70\"}}\n```",
