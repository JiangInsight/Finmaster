Identify the \"Accounts Payable\" line item in the problem data.\n2. Note the initial and end values for \"Accounts Payable.\"\n3. The initial amount is 0.00, and the end amount is 5,596,070.00.\n4. This indicates that during the period, the company increased its liabilities for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\nThus, the specific line items corresponding to credit obligations are the \"Accounts Payable\" amounts.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '5596070.00'}}\n```",
