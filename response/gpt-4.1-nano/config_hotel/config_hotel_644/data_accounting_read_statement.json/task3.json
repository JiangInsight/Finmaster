The relevant account for amounts owed to the entity for goods or services provided on credit is typically called **\"Accounts Receivable.\"**\n2. In the table, the \"Accounts Receivable\" account exists, with initial and end amounts provided.\n3. The initial amount for \"Accounts Receivable\" is 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31).\n4. The end amount for \"Accounts Receivable\" is 335,639.38 (as of 2024-02-01).\n5. These figures represent the initial and final amounts owed to the entity for credit sales over the period.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the initial value of Accounts Receivable is 0.00, and the final value is 335,639.38.\n\nAnswer in required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"335639.38\"}}\n```",
