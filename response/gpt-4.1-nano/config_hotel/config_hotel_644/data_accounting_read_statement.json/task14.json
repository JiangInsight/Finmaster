                        "content": "To identify the total amount of liabilities expected to be settled in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle, we need to focus on the current liabilities as of the end date, since liabilities that are due imminently (within the operating cycle) are typically classified as current liabilities.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Look for liabilities on the balance sheet, especially focusing on the line items representing liabilities.\n2. From the data, the relevant liabilities are \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\".\n3. These liabilities are listed under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" which represent obligations payable within the operating cycle.\n4. We should take the \"end amount\" of \"Total Current Liabilities\" as the value expected to be settled in the normal course of the operating cycle, including initial and final values.\n5. The initial value of \"Total Current Liabilities\" is 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31), and the final value is 5,637,910.70 (as of 2024-02-01).\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Initial amount: 0.00\n- End amount: 5,637,910.70\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"5637910.70\"}}\n```",
