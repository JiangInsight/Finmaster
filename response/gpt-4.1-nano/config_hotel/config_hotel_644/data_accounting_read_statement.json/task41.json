Look for line items involving \"Tax,\" \"Tax Payable,\" or similar.\n2. Identify whether these are increases or decreases; an increase in tax payable indicates higher accrued taxes not yet paid.\n3. In the provided data, the line \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" appears as **41840.70**, which suggests an increase in tax payable (i.e., taxes accrued but not yet paid).\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and value are:\n- Line item: \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\"\n- Amount: 41840.70\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"41840.70\"}}\n```",
