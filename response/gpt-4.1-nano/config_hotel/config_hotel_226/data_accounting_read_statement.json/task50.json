This corresponds to **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**.\n   - The fourth item is the net change in cash and cash equivalents during the period, which is **Net Increase** in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n2. **Match these items with the corresponding values from the provided data:**\n   - Depreciation: 115511.91\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Inventory: -8466430.00\n   - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -1213417.20\n   - Net Increase in cash and cash equivalents: -2180564.22\n\n3. **Order the answers as per the original line item sequence:**\n   1. Depreciation\n   2. (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\n   3. Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n   4. Net Increase in cash and cash equivalents\n\nNow, I will prepare the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '115511.91', 'value2': '-8466430.00', 'value3': '-1213417.20', 'value4': '-2180564.22'} }\n```",
