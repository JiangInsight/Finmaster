                        "content": "To identify the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit, we need to look for line items related to increases in liabilities from the cash flow statement, specifically focusing on accounts payable or similar accounts indicative of credit purchases.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Examine the line items related to cash flows from operating activities:\n   - \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" indicates changes in liabilities owed for goods or services received.\n   \n2. In the first problem data:\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable = 1,590,000.00\n     - An increase here suggests that the entity purchased more on credit during the period, adding to what it owes.\n\n3. In the second problem data:\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable = 7,566,370.00\n     - Similarly, this reflects an increase in liabilities from credit purchases during this period.\n\n4. According to the task, we are asked to identify and extract the line item \"the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit,\" which corresponds to the increase in accounts payable during the period.\n\nFinal answer:\n- For the first problem: 1,590,000.00\n- For the second problem: 7,566,370.00\n\nSince the question asks specifically for the second problem:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"7566370.00\"}}\n```",
