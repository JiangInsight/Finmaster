                        "content": "To find the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit during the period, I need to identify the relevant line item in the cash flow statement.\n\nTypically, such decreases are reflected under \"Accounts Payable\" because a decrease indicates that the company paid off some of its liabilities related to credit purchases. When \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is negative, it represents a decrease in accounts payable, i.e., the company paid off some amounts owed.\n\nLooking at the provided data:\n\n- The line \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Payable\" is:\n  - For 2024-02-02: 7566370.00 (which is an increase)\n  - Since the value is positive, it indicates an increase in accounts payable, meaning the company owes more.\n\nIn the question, we're asked for the decrease in amounts owed for goods/services on credit, which corresponds to a **decrease** in accounts payable (a negative change). This is directly given by the negative of the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" value when it's negative.\n\nIn our case, the only value related to \"Decrease in Accounts Payable\" would be when the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is negative.\n\n- The only relevant line indicates an increase (positive number), so the change in accounts payable during this period was an increase, not a decrease.\n\nTherefore, the decrease in amounts owed to the entity, representing a reduction in accounts payable during the period, is in the case where the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" would be negative (a decline). Since the data shows a positive change, there was no decrease; instead, there's an increase.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The change in \"Accounts Payable\" is +7,566,370.00 (an increase), so there was no decrease during this period.\n- Since the question asks specifically for the decrease, and the value is not negative here, the decrease value is 0.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"0\"}}\n```",
