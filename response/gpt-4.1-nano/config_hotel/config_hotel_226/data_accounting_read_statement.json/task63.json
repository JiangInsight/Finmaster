The negative value indicates cash used rather than generated, but it is the principal source from operating activities.\n\n3. **From the Income Statement**:\n   - The total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities is the \"Net Profit,\" which is:\n     - First case: **112375.10**\n     - Second case: **112375.10** (both statements agree)\n   - But the user asks specifically for total income from ordinary activities, which is typically represented by \"Net Profit.\"\n\n4. **From the Balance Sheet**:\n   - The amount of taxes accrued but not yet paid is given by \"Taxes Payable,\" which is **38779.91**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Principal revenue-producing activities net cash (from the Cash Flow Statement)**: **-967147.02**\n- **Total income arising in ordinary activities (Net Profit, from Income Statement)**: **112375.10**\n- **Taxes accrued but not yet paid (Taxes Payable, from Balance Sheet)**: **38779.91**\n\n---\n\n### Final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"-967147.02\", \"value2\": \"112375.10\", \"value3\": \"38779.91\"}}\n```",
