                        "content": "First, identify the relevant section: the balance sheet, which shows the inventory starting and ending amounts. To determine the inventory sold during the reporting period, we'll use the formula:\n\nInventory Sold = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory\n\nHowever, the balance sheet provides only the beginning and ending inventory amounts, not purchases. The change in inventory (decrease or increase) can be linked to the cost of goods sold (COGS), as per the cash flow statement where the \"Decrease in Inventory\" is reported.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- (Increase) Decrease in Inventory = -8466430.00\n\nThis indicates the inventory decreased by 8,466,430 during the period, which is typically associated with inventory sold.\n\nGiven that:\n- Beginning inventory (from the initial balance sheet) = 0.00\n- Ending inventory (from the end balance sheet) = 8,466,430.00\n\nSince the decrease in inventory equals the cost of goods sold (COGS), we can infer the following:\n- COGS during the period is 4,96220.00 (from income statement), which matches the inventory decrease related to sales.\n\nBut the problem asks explicitly for the line item \"carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period\".\n\n**Therefore:**\n\n- Line item: Cost of Goods Sold\n- Value: 496220.00\n\n**Note:** The inventory decrease is significantly larger than COGS, which might be due to inventory write-offs or other adjustments, but since COGS is the recognized expense related to inventories sold, this is the relevant figure.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '496220.00'}}\n```",
