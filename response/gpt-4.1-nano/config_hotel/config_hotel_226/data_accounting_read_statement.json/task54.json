The expense related to selling the product to customers is typically called \"Selling Expenses.\"\n2. The expense associated with securing orders, such as marketing and sales activities, also falls under \"Selling Expenses.\"\n3. Other expenses like \"Administrative Expenses\" are more general and not directly tied to the cost of securing orders and delivering goods/services.\n4. Therefore, the relevant line item should be \"Selling Expenses.\"\n5. From the provided income statement:\n   - Selling Expenses = 10,967.95\n\nThus, the specific line item and its value related to costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver the goods/services are the \"Selling Expenses\" worth 10,967.95.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '10967.95'} }\n```",
