However, the typical components are:\n  - Purchase of fixed assets (negative cash flow)\n  - Sale of fixed assets (if given, positive cash flow)\n  - Receipt of dividends and interest (usually in operating or investing or financing activities depending on classification)\n\nIn this statement:\n- There is no explicit sale of fixed assets listed, nor is there a specific line for interest/dividends receipts under investing activities.\n\n### Step 4: Final calculation\n- Since only \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is shown with a value of 1,213,417.20, and the net investing cash flow is the negative of that, the main component contributing to investing cash flow is this purchase.\n\n### Step 5: Final result\n- The total net cash flow from investing activities is **-1,213,417.20**, which originates from the purchase of fixed assets.\n- There are no other separate sub-items ultimately listed here for disposal or receipt of dividends/interest under investing activities.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer in the specified format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value\": \"-1213417.20\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value\": \"1213417.20\"\n  }\n}\n```",
