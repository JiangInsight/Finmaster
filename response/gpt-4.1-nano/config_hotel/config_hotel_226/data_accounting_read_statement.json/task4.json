The relevant line item appears to be \"Interest Receivable,\" which records accrued interest not yet collected.\n\n3. Initial amount of \"Interest Receivable\" is 0.00 (at the start date, 2023-12-31).\n\n4. End amount of \"Interest Receivable\" is 12,737.96 (at the end date, 2024-02-02).\n\n5. This indicates that interest was accrued during this period, which has not yet been received yet.\n\nThus, the line item identified is \"Interest Receivable\" with initial and final values as specified.\n\n**Final answer in the required JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '12737.96'}}\n```",
