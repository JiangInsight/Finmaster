We are asked to identify and extract the specific line items indicating the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares, including the initial and final values.\n2. Typically, the paid-in capital (or share capital) account on the balance sheet reflects the amount contributed by shareholders for shares issued.\n3. In this case, the relevant account is \"Paid-in Capital\" which appears in both initial and end periods.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Initial Paid-in Capital: 16,000,000.00\n- Final Paid-in Capital: 16,000,000.00\n\nSince these values are the same, the initial and final contribution by shareholders (capital contributed in exchange for shares) did not change over this period.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"16000000.00\", \"end value\": \"16000000.00\"}}\n```",
