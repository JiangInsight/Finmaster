In a balance sheet, retained earnings reflect the accumulated profits or losses that have been retained by the entity rather than distributed.\n\nIn the provided data, the line item \"Retained Earnings\" shows an initial value of 0.00 on 2023-12-31 and an end value of 112375.10 on 2024-02-02. This indicates that retained earnings have increased by this amount during the period, representing the profit or loss retained.\n\nTherefore, the initial amount of retained earnings is 0.00, and the final amount is 112375.10.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"112375.10\"}}\n```",
