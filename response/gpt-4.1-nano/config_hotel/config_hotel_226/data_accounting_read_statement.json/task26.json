Look at the income statement for any line items explicitly related to \"financing costs\" or \"financial expenses.\"\n2. In this case, the line item \"Financial Expenses\" is likely to represent the costs associated with raising funds, since it aligns with financing costs.\n3. The value associated with \"Financial Expenses\" is 438.86.\n\nTherefore, the financing costs incurred are 438.86.\n\nAnswer in the specified JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '438.86'} }\n```",
