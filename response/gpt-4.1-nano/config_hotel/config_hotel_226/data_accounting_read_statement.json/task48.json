The amount of profit retained after all expenses (including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) have been deducted from total revenue.\n2. The cash payments made to acquire property, plant, and equipment (capital expenditures).\n\nFrom the given cash flow statement, the relevant line items are:\n\n- The net profit (or net income) is given directly as \"Net Profit\".\n- The cash payments for property, plant, and equipment are reflected as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the investing activities section.\n\nNow, extracting these values:\n\n- Net Profit: 112,375.10\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 1,213,417.20\n\n**Note:** The \"Net Profit\" already accounts for all expenses, and the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" indicates the cash outflow related to acquiring long-term assets.\n\n**Therefore, the two specific line items and their values are:**\n\n1. Profit retained after expenses: 112,375.10\n2. Cash payments for property, plant, and equipment: 1,213,417.20\n\n**Final answer in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"112375.10\", \"value2\": \"1213417.20\"}}\n```",
