Identify liabilities that are expected to be settled in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle. These are generally current liabilities.\n\n2. From the table, the liabilities are:\n   - Accounts Payable\n   - Taxes Payable\n\n3. Both of these liabilities are classified as current liabilities, indicating they are expected to be settled within the normal operating cycle.\n\n4. Extract the initial and end amounts for these liabilities:\n   - Accounts Payable: Initial = 0.00, End = 7,566,370.00\n   - Taxes Payable: Initial = 0.00, End = 38,779.91\n\n5. Sum these amounts for the initial and end values:\n   - Initial total liabilities = 0.00 + 0.00 = 0.00\n   - End total liabilities = 7,566,370.00 + 38,779.91 = 7,605,149.91\n\nThe total amount of liabilities expected to be settled in the normal course of the operating cycle is the sum of current liabilities:\n\n**Initial total:** 0.00  \n**Final total:** 7,605,149.91\n\nFinal answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"7605149.91\"}}\n```",
