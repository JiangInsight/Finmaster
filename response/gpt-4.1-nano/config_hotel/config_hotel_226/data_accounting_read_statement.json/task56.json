The task is to identify and extract the line item that represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.\n\n2. From the cash flow section across all provided data, we look for the line item related to depreciation:\n\n   In the first example, the line item \"Depreciation\" shows a value of 45751.41.\n   \n   In the second example, the line item \"Depreciation\" shows a value of 115511.91.\n\n3. The depreciation amount is always presented clearly, and it corresponds to the depreciation expense recorded in the income statement or cash flow statement, representing the systematic allocation.\n\n4. In both datasets, the depreciation figure is explicitly marked as \"Depreciation\" with its respective amount, indicating this is the line item in question.\n\n5. Our task is based on the second given problem statement, which also features \"Depreciation\" in the cash flow section with the amount 115511.91.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item value for the systematic allocation (depreciation expense) is **115511.91**.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"115511.91\"}}\n```",
