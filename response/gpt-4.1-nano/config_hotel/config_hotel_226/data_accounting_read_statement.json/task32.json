                        "content": "First, let's identify the key line item representing the profit an entity retains after all expenses, which is generally the \"Net Profit.\"\n\nFrom the provided data:\n\n- Main Revenue: 775,598.77\n- Total Revenue: 775,598.77\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 496,220.00\n- Total Cost: 496,220.00\n- Gross Profit: 279,378.77\n- Administrative Expenses: 14,043.00\n- Selling Expenses: 10,967.95\n- Depreciation: 115,511.91\n- Financial Expenses: 438.86\n- Total Expenses: 140,961.72\n- Interest Income: 12,737.96\n- Profit Before Tax: 151,155.01\n- Tax Expense: 38,779.91\n- Net Profit: 112,375.10\n\nThe net profit after all expenses, taxes, and other costs is **112,375.10**.\n\nNext, decompose this net profit into 5 component sub-items that originate from the input statement. These sub-items should capture key components contributing to the net profit:\n\nPossible sub-items could be:\n1. Operating Income (which is Main Business Revenue)\n2. Cost of Goods Sold\n3. Total Expenses (which include all operating and non-operating expenses before tax)\n4. Interest Income\n5. Tax Expense\n\nNow, let's assign their initial and final values:\n\n- Operating Income / Main Business Revenue: 775,598.77\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 496,220.00\n- Total Expenses (including Operating expenses, Depreciation, Financial Expenses, etc.): 140,961.72\n- Interest Income: 12,737.96\n- Tax Expense: 38,779.91\n\nFinally, the net profit is calculated as:\n\nNet Profit = (Main Revenue + Interest Income) - (Cost of Goods Sold + Total Expenses + Tax Expense)\n\nCalculating:\n\n(775,598.77 + 12,737.96) - (496,220.00 + 140,961.72 + 38,779.91) = 788,336.73 - 675,961.63 = 112,375.10\n\n符合题意。\n\nNow, formulate the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"112375.10\", \"sub_items_sub_item_1\": \"775598.77\", \"sub_items_sub_item_2\": \"496220.00\", \"sub_items_sub_item_3\": \"140961.72\", \"sub_items_sub_item_4\": \"12737.96\", \"sub_items_sub_item_5\": \"38779.91\"}}\n```",
