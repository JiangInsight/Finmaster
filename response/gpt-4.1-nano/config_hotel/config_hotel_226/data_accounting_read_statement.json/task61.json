Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers.\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\n### Step 1: Identify costs to secure and deliver orders (usually part of selling and administrative expenses)\n- These costs are typically categorized within \"Selling Expenses\" and \"Administrative Expenses\" in the income statement.\n- Both \"Selling Expenses\" and \"Administrative Expenses\" are relevant here.\n- From the income statements:\n\n  - First income statement:\n    - Selling Expenses: 493,854.67\n  - Second income statement:\n    - Selling Expenses: 10,967.95\n  - Since the task asks for the costs related to securing and delivering orders, \"Selling Expenses\" is the primary line item.\n\n### Step 2: Identify cash payments for property, plant, and equipment (capital expenditures)\n- These are reflected in the cash flow statement under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n- This amount indicates the cash spent on acquiring property, plant, and equipment.\n\n- From the cash flow statements:\n  - First cash flow:\n    - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 305,354.43\n  - Second cash flow:\n    - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 1,213,417.20\n\n### Step 3: Finalize the answers\n- The line item for securing orders and delivering goods/services:\n  - \"Selling Expenses\" in the income statement.\n\n- The line item for capital expenditure:\n  - \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the cash flow statement.\n\n### Step 4: Present the results\n- The values from the most recent (latest) statements are 493,854.67 for selling expenses and 305,354.43 for purchases of fixed assets.\n\n### Final answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '493854.67', 'value2': '305354.43'}}\n```\n\nThis matches the pattern in the provided example and is based on the latest figures in the data.",
