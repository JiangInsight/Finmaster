Current assets generally include cash, bank deposits, receivables, inventory, and other assets expected to be converted into cash or used up within one operating cycle.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify current assets**: These are typically listed under \"Total Current Assets\" or as individual accounts such as cash, bank deposits, receivables, and inventory.\n2. **Extract relevant line items**:\n   - Cash on Hand\n   - Bank Deposits\n   - Interest Receivable\n   - Accounts Receivable\n   - Inventory\n3. **Note the initial and end values** for these current assets.\n4. **Sum these as part of total current assets**.\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- Initial total current assets: 8,000,000.00\n- Final total current assets: 14,619,619.72\n\nThus, the specific line items for current assets that are expected to be realized or used in operational cycle are the sum of these individual items.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '14619619.72'}}\n```",
