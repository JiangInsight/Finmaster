Examine the provided cash flow statement for relevant line items indicating asset reductions.\n2. Look for keywords such as \"assets held for sale,\" \"held for sale,\" \"assets in process of sale,\" or \"assets in manufacturing for sale.\"\n3. In this case, the statement contains a line:\n   - \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with a value of -8,466,430.00.\n4. Inventory typically includes assets that are in production, held for sale, or in the process of being manufactured. A reduction in inventory can signify that some assets previously held for sale or in production have been sold or otherwise disposed of.\n5. Since the problem asks specifically for the reduction in assets held for sale during the period, the relevant line item appears to be the decrease in inventory.\n\nThe decrease in inventory is valued at -8,466,430.00, which aligns with the reduction of assets held for sale or in manufacturing for sale.\n\nFinal answer in the required format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-8466430.00'}}\n```",
