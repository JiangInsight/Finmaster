                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate three financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: \n\n1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n2. Gross Profit Margin\n3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nLet's analyze each step-by-step using the data.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Liabilities and Total Assets (from Balance Sheet)\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets = 23,717,525.01 (End_amount)\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities + Total Non-current Liabilities (assuming only current liabilities are given)\n  \nCurrent Liabilities (Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable) = 7,605,149.91  \nTotal Assets = 23,717,525.01\n\nNote: The problem only explicitly states Liabilities as \"Total Current Liabilities\" and \"Total Liabilities\" are implied as the difference between total assets and ownerâ€™s equity.\n\nOwner's Equity = 16,112,375.10  \nTotal Liabilities = Total Assets - Owner's Equity = 23,717,525.01 - 16,112,375.10 = 7,605,149.91 (which matches total current liabilities as per the data)\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{7,605,149.91}{23,717,525.01} \\approx 0.321\n\\]\n\nExpressed as a decimal and rounded to two decimal places: 0.32\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Gross Profit Margin\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nFrom income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 279,378.77\n- Total Revenue = 775,598.77\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{279,378.77}{775,598.77} \\times 100 \\approx 36.05\\%\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -967,147.02\n- Total Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{-967,147.02}{7,605,149.91} \\approx -0.127\n\\]\n\nExpressed as a decimal rounded to two decimal places: -0.13\n\n---\n\n### Final answers:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.32', 'Gross Profit Margin': '36.05%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.13'}}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Note:\nThe initial sample problem's \"solution\" used different ratios (e.g., 0.14 for Debt to Asset Ratio), but based on the calculations above, these are the accurate ratios derived specifically from the provided data in this problem.",
