Here are the steps:\n\n1. Identify Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities.\n2. Identify the purchase of fixed assets (CapEx) from investing activities, which is the cash spent on fixed assets.\n3. Calculate FCF as:  \n   **FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Purchase of Fixed Assets**\n\nGiven data:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -967147.02\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (CapEx) = 1213417.20\n\nCalculate:\n\nFCF = -967147.02 - 1213417.20 = -2184564.22\n\nRounded to two decimal places:\n\n**FCF = -2184564.22**\n\nNow, presenting the answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-2184564.22'} }\n```",
