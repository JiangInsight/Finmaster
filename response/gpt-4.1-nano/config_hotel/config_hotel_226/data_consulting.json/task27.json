                        "content": "Let's proceed step by step to calculate each ratio:\n\n**1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio**\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -967147.02\n- Net Profit = 112375.10\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\nSince Net Profit is positive, but Operating Cash Flow is negative, the ratio will be negative:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-967147.02}{112375.10} \\approx -8.61\n\\]\n\nBut the previous example's ratio was given as '4.41' (positive), indicating perhaps they used the absolute value. To reflect the magnitude, using absolute values is typical:\n\n\\[\n| -8.61 | \\approx 8.61\n\\]\n\nHowever, they reported '4.41', which suggests they may be using a different method or perhaps just the ratio of absolute values, but in real practice, it is the ratio of operating cash flow to net income, noting that negative cash flows might be reflected directly.\n\nGiven the pattern, we will provide the absolute value:\n\n**Answer:** 8.61\n\n**2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio**\n\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales:\n\\[\n\\text{Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the average current assets:\n\n- Initial (2023-12-31): 8,000,000.00\n- End (2024-02-02): 14,619,619.72\n\nAverage:\n\\[\n\\frac{8,000,000 + 14,619,619.72}{2} = 11,309,809.86\n\\]\n\nTotal Revenue for the period:\n- 775,598.77\n\nThus:\n\\[\n\\text{Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{775,598.77}{11,309,809.86} \\approx 0.0685\n\\]\n\nRounded to two decimal places: 0.07\n\n**3. Quick Ratio**\n\nThe quick ratio (also known as acid-test ratio) measures the company's ability to meet short-term obligations with its most liquid assets:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Assets} = \\text{Cash on Hand} + \\text{Bank Deposits} + \\text{Interest Receivable} + \\text{Accounts Receivable}\n\\]\n\nFrom the end balance:\n- Cash on Hand: 2,067,352.98\n- Bank Deposits: 3,752,082.80\n- Interest Receivable: 12,737.96\n- Accounts Receivable: 321,015.98\n\nSum:\n\\[\n2,067,352.98 + 3,752,082.80 + 12,737.96 + 321,015.98 = 6,153,189.72\n\\]\n\nCurrent liabilities:\n- Accounts Payable: 7,566,370.00\n- Taxes Payable: 38,779.91\n- Total Current Liabilities: 7,605,149.91\n\nQuick Ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{6,153,189.72}{7,605,149.91} \\approx 0.809\n\\]\n\nRounded to two decimal places: 0.81\n\n---\n\n### Final answer in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"8.61\", \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"0.07\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.81\"}}\n```",
