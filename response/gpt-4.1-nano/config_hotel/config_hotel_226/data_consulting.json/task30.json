                        "content": "Let's analyze each ratio step by step based on the given financial data.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Current Assets and Current Liabilities\n- **Current Assets** (from balance sheet end amounts):\n  - Cash on Hand: 2,067,352.98\n  - Bank Deposits: 3,752,082.80\n  - Interest Receivable: 12,737.96\n  - Accounts Receivable: 321,015.98\n  - Inventory: 8,466,430.00\n  - Total Current Assets = 2,067,352.98 + 3,752,082.80 + 12,737.96 + 321,015.98 + 8,466,430.00 = **14,619,619.72**\n\n- **Current Liabilities**:\n  - Accounts Payable: 7,566,370.00\n  - Taxes Payable: 38,779.91\n  - Total Current Liabilities = 7,566,370 + 38,779.91 = **7,605,149.91**\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Quick Assets\n- Quick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory\n- Quick Assets = 14,619,619.72 - 8,466,430.00 = **6,153,189.72**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Assets and Total Liabilities\n- **Total Assets**: 23,717,525.01\n- **Liabilities**:\n  - Total Current Liabilities: 7,605,149.91\n  - Total Non-current Liabilities are not explicitly given, but we know:\n    - Total Liabilities + Owner's Equity = Total Assets\n    - Owner's Equity = 16,112,375.10\n    - Therefore, Total Liabilities = Total Assets - Owner's Equity = 23,717,525.01 - 16,112,375.10 = **7,605,149.91** (matches current liabilities, indicating no non-current liabilities info provided separately, assuming liabilities equal current liabilities, possibly due to no non-current liabilities explicitly shown)\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Debt Ratios\n- **Debt to Asset Ratio** = Total Liabilities / Total Assets = 7,605,149.91 / 23,717,525.01 ≈ 0.3213 or 32.13%\n- **Debt to Equity Ratio** = Total Liabilities / Owner's Equity = 7,605,149.91 / 16,112,375.10 ≈ 0.472 or 47.2%\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Current Ratio and Quick Ratio\n- **Current Ratio** = Current Assets / Current Liabilities = 14,619,619.72 / 7,605,149.91 ≈ 1.92\n- **Quick Ratio** = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities = 6,153,189.72 / 7,605,149.91 ≈ 0.81\n\n### Step 6: Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n- From cash flow statement:\n  - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -967,147.02\n- Total debt is represented by total liabilities: 7,605,149.91\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow / Total Liabilities = -967,147.02 / 7,605,149.91 ≈ -0.127\n   \nAlternatively, some definitions use annual cash flow, but here we use the net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of cash flow.\n\n---\n\n### Final consolidated calculations:\n- Current Ratio ≈ 1.92\n- Quick Ratio ≈ 0.81\n- Debt to Asset Ratio ≈ 0.32\n- Debt to Equity Ratio ≈ 0.47\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio ≈ -0.13\n\n---\n\nNow, presenting the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Current Ratio\": \"1.92\", \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.81\", \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.32\", \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.47\", \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.13\"}}\n```",
