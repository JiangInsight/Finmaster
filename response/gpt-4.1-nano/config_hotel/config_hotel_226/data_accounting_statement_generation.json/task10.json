                        "content": "Let's analyze the data step by step to identify the initial and final amounts of non-current assets.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Non-current Assets (at the beginning)**  \nLook for data entries recorded on or close to the start date (2023-12-31) that involve fixed assets. \n\n- Entry:  \n  - **Fixed Assets** (Initial20231231001): amount = 8,000,000.00  \n  - **Fixed Assets Purchase** (2023-12-31): amount = 305,354.43 (Bank Transfer) – asset name: Storage Facilities4, asset type: Storage Facilities  \n  - **Fixed Assets Purchase** (2023-12-31): amount = 830,405.75 (Bank Transfer) – asset name: Central AC4, asset type: Central AC  \n\nTotal initial non-current assets =  \n8,000,000 (initial fixed assets) + 305,354.43 + 830,405.75 = **9,135,760.18**\n\n**Step 2: Final Non-current Assets (at the end of the period)**  \nIdentify all non-current assets at the end of the period, typically the latest entries recorded as assets. \n\nFrom the latest data entries:\n- **Fixed Assets Purchase** (2023-12-31): amount = 830,405.75 (same as initial, no change) – asset name: Kitchen Equipment5, asset type: Kitchen Equipment\n- **Fixed Asset** (2023-12-31): amount = 305,354.43 – storage facilities, asset type: Storage Facilities\n- **Fixed Assets Purchase** (2023-12-31): amount = 383,011.45 – asset name: Kitchen Equipment5, asset type: Kitchen Equipment\n- **Fixed Assets Purchase** (2023-12-31): amount = 110,880.0 – asset name: Deluxe Meal Set, asset type: Deluxe Meal Set\n- **Fixed Assets Purchase** (2023-12-31): amount = 236,720.0 – asset name: Deluxe Meal Set, asset type: Deluxe Meal Set\n\nAlso, at the beginning, the total was 9,135,760.18; at the end, additional fixed asset purchases increase total assets.\n\nCalculating the final total:\n- Existing fixed assets initially: 8,000,000.00\n- Purchases during the period:\n  - 305,354.43\n  - 830,405.75\n  - 383,011.45\n  - 110,880.0\n  - 236,720.0\n\nTotal purchases: 305,354.43 + 830,405.75 + 383,011.45 + 110,880.0 + 236,720.0 = **1,866,371.63**\n\nTotal at end of period:\nInitial fixed assets + purchases = 8,000,000 + 1,866,371.63 = **9,866,371.63**\n\nHowever, note that the initial fixed assets (8 million) are old, and the new purchases increase the total effectively to the latest values.\n\n**But the latest total fixed assets recorded at the end seem to be higher and include newer assets. From the latest entry (2024-01-31):**  \n- **Fixed Assets Purchase** (2023-12-31): amount = 830,405.75 (Kitchen Equipment)  \n- **Fixed Assets Purchase** (2023-12-31): amount = 110,880.0 (Deluxe Meal Set)  \n- **Fixed Assets Purchase** (2023-12-31): amount = 236,720.0 (Deluxe Meal Set)  \n- **Fixed Assets** (2023-12-31): amount = 8,000,000.00 (initial fixed assets)  \n\nTotal fixed assets at end:  \n8,000,000.00 + 305,354.43 + 830,405.75 + 110,880.0 + 236,720.0 = **9,483,360.18**  \n\nBut considering the assets listed with cumulative amount at the latest (e.g., the total fixed assets purchase value on 2023-12-31 was 830,405.75 for Kitchen Equipment, and large fixed assets are growing in total). The initial total fixed assets summed to 8 million, and additional fixed assets purchased amount to several hundreds of thousands, the effective total at the latest is approximately:\n\n**9,135,760.18** (initial fixed assets + purchases).\n\nNow, to be precise, the largest fixed assets values at the end are:\n- The initial fixed assets: 8,000,000\n- New fixed assets purchased during the period total: 305,354.43 + 830,405.75 + 383,011.45 + 110,880 + 236,720 = 1,866,371.63\n\nFinal total = initial + new = 8,000,000 + 1,866,371.63 = **9,866,371.63**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Initial non-current assets: **8,000,000.00** (from the record on 2023-12-31 as fixed assets)\n- Final non-current assets: Sum of initial + purchases during the period:\n  - 8,000,000 + (305,354.43 + 830,405.75 + 383,011.45 + 110,880 + 236,720) = 8,000,000 + 1,866,371.63 = **9,866,371.63**\n\n---\n\n**Final answer in the required JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '9866371.63'} }\n```",
