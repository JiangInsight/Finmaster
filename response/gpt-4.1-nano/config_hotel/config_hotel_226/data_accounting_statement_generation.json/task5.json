The total interest receivable on the final date (i.e., latest unpaid interest) is the cumulative amount of interest accrued but not yet received at that date.\n\n**Step 3: Final amount (Interest Receivable End Value)**\n\nThe last unpaid interest is on 2024-02-28: 368.02, and additional smaller interest on 2024-02-25 and 2024-02-24, etc., sum up cumulatively.\n\nSumming all interest receivable entries from the earliest to latest unpaid:\n\n- The total interest receivable amount at the latest date is approximately **2672.87**\n\n**Step 4: Initial amount (Interest Receivable Initial Value)**\n\nSince the first interest receivable was recorded on 2024-01-01 with 445.0, and there were subsequent accruals, the initial value as of the very first record is **0.00** (assuming no prior accrued interest), as interest is generally accrued day by day.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Initial interest receivable value: 0.00\n- Final interest receivable value: 2672.87\n\n---\n\n**Answer in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Interest Receivable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Interest Receivable End Value\": \"2672.87\"} }\n```",
