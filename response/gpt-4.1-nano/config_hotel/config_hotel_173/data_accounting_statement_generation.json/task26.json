Since the second dataset explicitly repeats depreciation amount for a specific date and asset, and considering typical accounting treatment, we consider each depreciation expense only once unless specified otherwise.\n\n**Step 2: Sum the unique depreciation expenses**\n\n- From the first dataset: 45751.41 + 50737.35 = 96488.76\n- The second dataset also mentions 50737.35, which is already included.\n\n**Step 3: Final depreciation to report**\n\nAdding both, total depreciation expense:\n\n- 45751.41 + 50737.35 = **96488.76**\n\n**Step 4: Final answer**\n\nThe depreciation to be reported as the last allocated (or final depreciation expense in the income statement) is **45751.41** as per the first dataset's depreciation, which is typically the latest or most relevant.\n\nGiven the structure and the example solution, it seems the final depreciation entry is 45751.41.\n\n---\n\n**Final step: format answer**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Depreciation\": \"45751.41\"}}\n```",
