Given the task's emphasis on calculating initial and final amounts, the \"initial\" fixed assets are taken as the earliest recorded initial amount, i.e., 5,000,000.00.\n\n**Initial fixed asset value:** 5,000,000.00\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Find transactions adding to fixed assets (purchases)**\n\nIn dataset 2:\n- FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 305354.43\n- Purchase20231231006 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 1150000.00\n\nIn dataset 3:\n- Fixed Asset purchase: 251793.02  \n- Purchase 1: 790,000  \n- Purchase 2: 1,495,000  \n- Purchase 3: 134,000  \n\nTotal additions (sum of all fixed asset purchases):\n\n- Dataset 2 fixed asset purchase: 305,354.43  \n- Dataset 3 fixed asset purchases: 251,793.02 + 1,495,000 + 134,000 = 1,880,793.02\n\nTotal fixed assets at the end:\n\n- Initial: 5,000,000.00\n- Plus purchases (sum of those recorded as fixed assets): 305,354.43 + 251,793.02 + 1,495,000 + 134,000 = 2,186,147.45\n\n**Note**: The most recent purchase in dataset 3 is 251,793.02, which aligns with the initial fixed assets purchase, but the second dataset's initial value is 5,000,000.00 and gets revalued to 8,000,000.00.\n\nFrom the second dataset, the total fixed assets after purchase is explicitly given as 5,305,354.43, which likely reflects accumulated or updated valuation. Similarly, the 8,000,000.00 is the latest updated or end-year valuation.\n\n**Given the initial asset value was 5,000,000.00 and the final is 8,000,000.00 (from the dataset), the task asks for initial and final amounts of fixed assets.**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Final amount**\n\n- The last recorded value in the second dataset is 5,305,354.43.\n- The initial is 5,000,000.00 (before purchase and depreciation).\n\n**Step 4: Final check**\n\nGiven the task's examples and the pattern, the initial fixed assets are the first record, and the final is the latest record in the dataset.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Fixed Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Fixed Assets End Value\": \"5305354.43\"}}\n```",
