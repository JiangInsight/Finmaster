So the net change considers approved payments reducing the accounts payable.\n\nStep 4: Final calculation:\n- Initial unpaid accounts payable = total unpaid purchase amounts (~7,185,250)\n- Payments made reducing the payable = sum of paid purchases (~1,509,700)\n- Hence, the net increase in accounts payable is:\n= total unpaid purchase amounts after considering the paid ones\n= 7,185,250 - 1,509,700 = 5,675,550\n\nBut the problem asks for the increase or decrease, and considering the new purchases and payments, the main change appears in the unpaid invoices residually.\n\nAlternatively, considering the total unpaid invoices at the start and end:\n\nSince initial unpaid is about 7,185,250 and total payments are about 1,509,700, the net increase in accounts payable is approximately:\n\n7,185,250 - (payments accounted in the period's paid invoices) = about 5,675,550\n\nHowever, considering the data and the typical interpretation, the key contribution is the gross increase of outstanding payables: the total new unpaid purchase amounts minus the paid ones, which is approximately 1,590,000 (roughly the latest unpaid purchases) minus the payments.\n\nMost reliably, the data shows that the net increase (or decrease) in accounts payable at the period end is the sum of the unpaid purchase invoices:\n\nFinal estimate: Approximately 1,590,000 (total unpaid) minus the reduction from payments made.\n\nThe total unpaid invoices from above sum to about 7,185,250, but many paid invoices cancel. The main unpaid contributes about 1,495,000 + 240,000 + 95,920 + 39,900 + 46,550 + 97,650 + 21,150 + 222,000 + 524,160 + 15,150 + 838,080 + 256,080 + 145,000 + 69,450 + 524,160 + 100,000 + 300,000 + 170,000 + 130,000 + 220,000 + 180,000 + 210,000 + 200,000 + 190,000 + 160,000 + 250,000 + 145,000 + 175,000 + 125,000 = 6,890,750\n\nIn the above data, most unpaid invoices remain unpaid, resulting in a significant increase.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe final change in accounts payable is approximately 1,590,000 to 1,600,000 depending on all unpaid invoices.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '1590000.00'} }",
