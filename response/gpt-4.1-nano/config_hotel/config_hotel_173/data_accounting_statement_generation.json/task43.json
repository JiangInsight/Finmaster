Since they are unpaid, they do not affect the cash flow directly. However, for cash flow statement purposes, only actual cash received affects cash flow. So, unpaid interest receivables are not cash inflows.\n\n---\n\n### Calculations:\n\n**Cash inflows:**\n\n- Sum of all \"Paid\" sales:\n\n| Date | Sale amount | Payment method | Remarks |\n| --- | ---
