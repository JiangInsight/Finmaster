COGS represents the cost of inventory that has been sold during the period.\n\nFrom the provided income statement for the reporting period ending 2024-02-04:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 543,370.00\n\nAdditionally, reviewing the balance sheet, the inventory at the beginning (initial date) was 7,783,800.00, and at the end of the period (end date), it was also 7,783,800.00, indicating no change in inventory level.\n\nSince the inventory level remained the same, and COGS is given, the total amount of inventory that was sold during the period is exactly the COGS.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item value of inventories sold during the reporting period is 543,370.00.\n\nAnswer in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '543370.00'} }\n```",
