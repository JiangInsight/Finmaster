Typically, these items are reflected under account titles such as \"Increase in Tax Payable\" or similar. \n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- _Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable_: The amount listed is 42,584.04 as of 2024-02-04.\n\nThis represents the change (increase) in tax payable, i.e., tax accrued but not yet paid, during the period. Since the problem asks specifically for the value of increase in amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid, we consider this figure.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item of interest is \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an amount of 42,584.04.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"42584.04\"}}\n```",
