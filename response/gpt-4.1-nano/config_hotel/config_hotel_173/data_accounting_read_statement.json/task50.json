Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**  \n- This is typically represented by a line item related to depreciation.  \n- In the data, the line \"Depreciation\" shows 96479.34.\n\n**2. Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period**  \n- Usually captured as changes in inventory or assets held for sale.  \n- The line \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" shows -7783800.00, indicating a decrease in inventory assets (which can relate to assets held for sale or in process).\n\n**3. Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents, and the receipt of interest and dividends**  \n- This is generally reflected as \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" which is -251793.02.\n\n**4. Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**  \n- This is calculated as \"Net Increase,\" which shows -4762630.10.\n\n**Summary of extracted values:**\n- Value 1: Depreciation = 96479.34\n- Value 2: Decrease in assets (inventory/assets held for sale) = -7783800.00\n- Value 3: Net cash flow from investing activities = -251793.02\n- Value 4: Net increase in cash and cash equivalents = -4762630.10\n\nNow, let's prepare the answer accordingly.\n\n**Final answer in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '96479.34', 'value2': '-7783800.00', 'value3': '-251793.02', 'value4': '-4762630.10'}}\n```",
