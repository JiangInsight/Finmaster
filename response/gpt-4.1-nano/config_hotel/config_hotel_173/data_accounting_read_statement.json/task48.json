The amount of profit retained after all expenses (including operating costs, interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization).  \n2. The cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment (PPE) and other long-term assets.\n\nLet's analyze the data step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the profit after expenses  \nThe relevant line for profit after all expenses (including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) is usually the \"Net Profit\" line.\n\n- Net Profit: 143922.03\n\nThis is the profit after all expenses, so this is **Value 1**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the cash payments for property, plant, and equipment  \nThis is typically found under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" specifically the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" line, which is cash outflow related to acquiring property, plant, and equipment.\n\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 251793.02\n\nThis amount represents the cash payments made for acquiring PPE and long-term assets. So, this is **Value 2**.\n\n### Final answer:\n- Value 1: Net Profit = 143922.03\n- Value 2: Purchase of Fixed Assets = 251793.02\n\n### JSON output:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '143922.03', 'value2': '251793.02'} }\n```",
