Identification of the three specific line items:\n\n   - Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period:\n     - This typically corresponds to \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\"\n     - Since the amount is positive, it indicates an increase in accounts payable, meaning the company owes more for goods/services received on credit.\n     - From the statement: **3333720.00**\n\n   - Acquisition of property, plant and equipment:\n     - This corresponds to \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n     - From the statement: **251793.02**\n\n   - Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period:\n     - From the statement: **Beginning Balance**\n     - The amount is: **8000000.00**\n\n2. Present the results in their original order:\n\n   1. Addition in amount owed (accounts payable): 3333720.00\n   2. Acquisition of property, plant and equipment: 251793.02\n   3. Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning: 8000000.00\n\nNow, formatting in the required JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3333720.00', 'value2': '251793.02', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
