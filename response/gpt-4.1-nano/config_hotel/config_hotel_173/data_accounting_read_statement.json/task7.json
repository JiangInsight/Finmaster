Common expenses typically include depreciation, interest expenses, and similar items, but the data provided only includes balance sheet accounts. Since the problem asks for expenses with an initial and final value, the most relevant is accumulated depreciation, which represents depreciation expense recognized over time.\n\n- **Accumulated Depreciation**:  \n  Initial amount: 0.00  \n  Final amount: 96479.34  \n\nThe change in accumulated depreciation from initial to final reflects the depreciation expense recorded during this period.\n\nNext, look for other accounts that could represent expenses. Accounts like \"Interest Receivable\" or \"Taxes Payable\" are not expenses themselves but liabilities or receivables. Since the problem specifies expense line items, only depreciation fits clearly.\n\n**Therefore:**\n\n- The expense is the depreciation expense recognized during the period, which is represented by the increase in accumulated depreciation.\n\n**Result:**\n\nInitial value: 0.00  \nFinal value: 96479.34\n\n---\n\n**Answer in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"96479.34\"}}\n```",
