These typically include cash, bank deposits, interest receivable, accounts receivable, and inventory, as they are either cash, receivables, or inventory held for sale.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Cash on Hand**: Cash is a current asset expected to be used or converted within the operating cycle.\n2. **Bank Deposits**: Bank deposits are liquid assets, part of current assets.\n3. **Interest Receivable**: Expected to be received in the short term, thus part of current assets.\n4. **Accounts Receivable**: Money owed to the entity, expected to be collected within the operating cycle.\n5. **Inventory**: Inventory held for sale in the normal course of business.\n\nSumming the initial and end values of these items:\n\n- **Initial total**:\n  - Cash on Hand: 3,000,000.00\n  - Bank Deposits: 5,000,000.00\n  - Interest Receivable: 0.00\n  - Accounts Receivable: 0.00\n  - Inventory: 0.00\n  - Sum: 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 0 + 0 + 0 = **8,000,000.00**\n\n- **End total**:\n  - Cash on Hand: 1,254,762.92\n  - Bank Deposits: 1,982,606.98\n  - Interest Receivable: 7,775.44\n  - Accounts Receivable: 335,967.05\n  - Inventory: 7,783,800.00\n  - Sum: 1,254,762.92 + 1,982,606.98 + 7,775.44 + 335,967.05 + 7,783,800.00 = **11,364,912.39**\n\nThus, the line items and their total values are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"11364912.39\"}}\n```",
