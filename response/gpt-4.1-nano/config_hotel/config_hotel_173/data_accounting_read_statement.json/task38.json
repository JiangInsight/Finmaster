However, the line explicitly states \"Increase (Decrease)\", and the value is positive (3,333,720.00). This indicates that during the period, accounts payable increased by that amount, meaning the entity owes more, not less.\n\nThe task asks for the decrease in amounts owed, i.e., a reduction in accounts payable. Since the value provided is an increase, the decrease would be its negative counterpart if it existed. But there's no negative change indicated here; instead, there's an increase.\n\nTherefore, **if the change was negative, that would be the decrease;** but since it's positive, **it indicates an increase in payables, not a decrease**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The data shows an increase, not a decrease, in accounts payable. Hence, **there's no line item indicating a decrease in amounts owed during this period** in the provided data.\n\n**Final answer:** No decrease in amounts owed is explicitly shown.\n\nBut, the task specifies to identify and extract the line item for decrease in amounts owed to the entity, which would be reflected as a negative change in \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\". Since the only line is a positive increase, the decrease value is zero or not present.\n\n**Therefore, the answer is:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
