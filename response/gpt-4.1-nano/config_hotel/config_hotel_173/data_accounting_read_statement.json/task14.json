                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to identify the liabilities on the balance sheet that are expected to be settled in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle. These typically include current liabilities, as they are usually due within one year or within the normal operating cycle of the business.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Examine the balance sheet accounts:\n   - Accounts Payable: A current liability payable within the normal operating cycle.\n   - Taxes Payable: Also a current liability payable within the normal operating cycle.\n   \n2. The total current liabilities include both Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable, summing to:\n   - Initial: 0.00\n   - End: 3,376,304.04\n\n3. The total liabilities expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle are the total current liabilities.\n\nTherefore, the specific line items and their values are:\n- Accounts Payable: initial 0.00, final 3,333,720.00\n- Taxes Payable: initial 0.00, final 42,584.04\n\nSum of these liabilities:\n- Initial total: 0.00 + 0.00 = 0.00\n- Final total: 3,333,720.00 + 42,584.04 = 3,376,304.04\n\nHence, the total amount of liabilities expected to be settled in the normal course of the operating cycle is 3,376,304.04.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"3,376,304.04\"}}\n```",
