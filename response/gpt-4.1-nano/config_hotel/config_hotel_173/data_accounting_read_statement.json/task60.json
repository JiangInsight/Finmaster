The **end value of funds deposited into a bank** — this corresponds to the \"Bank Deposits\" at the end of the period, as deposits into a bank are typically recorded under \"Bank Deposits.\"\n2. The **income earned by an entity from financial assets** — this is usually reflected as \"Interest Income\" in the income statement.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Extract the \"Bank Deposits\" end amount**\n\n- From the balance sheet, under the \"End_amount\" for \"Bank Deposits,\" the value is **19,826,06.98**.\n\n**Step 3: Extract \"Interest Income\"**\n\n- From the income statement, the \"Interest Income\" is **7,775.44**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Present the results as per the asked JSON format.**\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"1982606.98\", \"value2\": \"7775.44\"}}\n```",
