In typical financial statements, these costs are often categorized under \"Selling Expenses\" or similar operating expenses because they relate to sales efforts and delivery.\n\n1. Look at the income statement's expenses:\n   - Selling Expenses are listed as 493,854.67 on the first dataset and 12,001.12 on the second.\n\n2. Commercially, expenses incurred specifically for securing customer orders and delivering goods are classified under:\n   - Selling Expenses (or Sales & Marketing Expenses)\n   - These often include advertising, sales commissions, delivery and logistics costs, etc.\n\n3. In the provided data, \"Selling Expenses\" is the relevant line item. The figure varies between datasets, but since the problem asks for a specific line item, we should identify the line item that best fits this purpose.\n\nConclusion:\n- The line item of costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods/services is \"Selling Expenses\" with the given amount.\n\nBetween the two datasets' figures:\n- First dataset: 493,854.67\n- Second dataset: 12,001.12\n\nSince the second dataset's \"Selling Expenses\" seem unusually low compared to revenue, the more plausible value considering typical cost structures is from the first dataset.\n\nAnswer: 493,854.67\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"493854.67\"}}\n```",
