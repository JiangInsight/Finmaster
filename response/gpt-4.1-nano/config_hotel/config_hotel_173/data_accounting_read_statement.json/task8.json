Locate the \"Accounts Payable\" account in the table.\n2. Note the initial amount and end amount.\n3. The initial value shows how much was owed at the start; the end value shows the amount owed at the end.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Initial amount for Accounts Payable: 0.00\n- End amount for Accounts Payable: 3,333,720.00\n\nTherefore, the specific line items are \"Accounts Payable\" with initial and final values as above.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3333720.00'}}\n```",
