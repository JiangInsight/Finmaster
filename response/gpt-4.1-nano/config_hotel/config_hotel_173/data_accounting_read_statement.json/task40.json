Scan through the data for a line mentioning \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\"\n2. The amount associated with this line indicates the change in accounts payable during the period.\n3. Since an increase in accounts payable represents additional credit purchases (goods/services received on credit), this line item contains the required value.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n- \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": 3,333,720.00\n\nThis value represents the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3,333,720.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"3333720.00\"}}\n```",
