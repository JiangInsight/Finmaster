The relevant line item: **\"Total Non-current Assets\"** at initial and end values.\n   \nFrom the given data:\n\n- Initial total non-current assets: 8,000,000.00  \n- End total non-current assets: 8,155,313.68  \n\nThese represent assets not expected to be realized, intended for sale, or consumed in the normal cycle, aligning with the task's requirement.\n\n**Final answer in the required JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"8155313.68\"}}\n```",
