Balance Sheet:**\n\n- The specific line item describing the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from the entity's activities that are the principal revenue-producing activities (operating activities) is *Cash and Cash Equivalents*. Since the question asks for the end value and we have ending balances, the relevant figure is **the ending balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents**: 3,237,369.90.\n\n- The second requested item: *the amounts of taxes accrued but not yet paid* is **Taxes Payable**. The balance is 42,584.04 (from the balance sheet data).\n\n- The third item: *total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities* corresponds to **Net Profit**. From the balance sheet section, the \"Net Profit\" is given in the income statement; since the balance sheet shows it as a retained earnings or net income component, but the specific figure for net profit is 143,922.03.\n\n**2. Cash Flow Statement:**\n\n- The net cash flow from operating activities is directly provided as **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -4,510,837.08.\n\n**3. Income Statement:**\n\n- The total income arising in the course of the entity’s ordinary activities is essentially the **Total Revenue**: 851,679.79.\n\n---\n\n### Final extraction:\n\n- **Balance Sheet:**\n  - Net cash (Cash and Cash Equivalents): 3,237,369.90\n  - Taxes payable: 42,584.04\n  - Net income: 143,922.03\n\n- **Cash Flow Statement:**\n  - Net cash flow from operating activities: -4,510,837.08\n\n- **Income Statement:**\n  - Total revenue: 851,679.79\n\n---\n\n### Output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"3237369.90\", \"value2\": \"42584.04\", \"value3\": \"143922.03\"}}\n```",
