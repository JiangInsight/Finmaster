Identify the account(s) representing amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit:\n   - These are typically called \"Accounts Receivable\".\n   - Initial amount: 0.00, End amount: 335967.05\n\n2. Identify the account(s) representing amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit:\n   - These are typically called \"Accounts Payable\".\n   - Initial amount: 0.00, End amount: 3,333,720.00\n\nTherefore, the two relevant line items are \"Accounts Receivable\" and \"Accounts Payable,\" with their respective initial and final amounts.\n\nNow, I'll format the answer accordingly:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '0.00', 'end valu1': '335967.05', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '3333720.00'}}\n```",
