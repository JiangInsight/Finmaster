Find the \"Net Profit\".\n3. Calculate the ratio: (Cash Flow From Operating Activities) / (Net Profit).\n\nFrom the problem data:\n\n- Cash Flow From Operating Activities = -4,510,837.08\n- Net Profit = 143,922.03\n\nCalculate the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-4,510,837.08}{143,922.03}\n\\]\n\nSince the ratio typically expresses how much operating cash flow relates to net income, and both are positive (or the ratio's absolute value), we take the absolute value for clarity:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} \\approx \\frac{4,510,837.08}{143,922.03} \\approx 31.31\n\\]\n\nHowever, the example provided shows the ratio as approximately 4.41, which suggests they might be calculating the ratio as a percentage or considering the absolute value, but in this case, the negative sign indicates the cash flow is negative, and the net income is positive.\n\nGiven the example's context, there may be a more refined interpretation, but the straightforward calculation yields approximately 31.31.\n\nTo align with typical presentation, let's present the ratio to two decimal places:\n\n**Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio**: **31.31**\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"31.31\"}}\n```",
