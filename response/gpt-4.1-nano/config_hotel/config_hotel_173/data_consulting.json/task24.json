Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:**  \n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From balance sheet:**\n- Total Assets = 19,520,226.07  \n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities + Total Non-current Liabilities  \n  - Total Current Liabilities = 3,376,304.04  \n  - Total Non-current Liabilities: The balance sheet shows no specific non-current liabilities beyond accounts payable and taxes payable. Usually, liabilities like long-term debt are not explicitly listed here, but since only current liabilities are provided, we'll consider total liabilities as current liabilities for this calculation.\n\nAssuming total liabilities = 3,376,304.04 (from current liabilities):\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\frac{3,376,304.04}{19,520,226.07} \\approx 0.173 \\]\n\nExpressed as a ratio: approximately 0.17 or 17%.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n**Formula:**  \n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income (Net Profit)}} \\]\n\n**From cash flow:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,510,837.08\n\n**From income statement:**\n- Net Profit = 143,922.03\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\frac{-4,510,837.08}{143,922.03} \\approx -31.3 \\]\n\nThis indicates the ratio is approximately -31.3, meaning cash flows from operating activities are negative relative to net income.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.17\", \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"-31.3\"}}\n```\n(Note: Rounded to two decimal places for clarity.)",
