The problem does not specify cash collections directly relevant to credit sales, but typically, the sales figure used is total sales (assuming all revenue is on credit or that credit sales approximate total revenue for simplicity).\n- Alternatively, if we consider the change in accounts receivable as an adjustment to cash collections, the net credit sales can be approximated by the revenue (assuming all sales are on credit).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio**\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n= 791,992.51 / 124,270.045 ≈ 6.37\n\n**Step 4: Compute the number of days for receivables**\n\n- The period is from 2023-12-31 to 2024-02-03 (~ 34 days).\n- For simplicity, we use 34 days as the period length.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Receivables Turnover in days**\n\n- Average collection period = 365 / Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n- = 365 / 6.37 ≈ 57.3 days\n\nAlternatively, some calculations simply present the turnover ratio itself.\n\n---\n\n**Final Step: Present the answer**\n\nBased on the calculations, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is approximately **6.37** times.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"6.37\"}}\n```",
