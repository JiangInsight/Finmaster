Conventionally, ratios are positive; the sign indicates the cash flow direction.\n\n- However, since the cash flow is negative, the ratio would be negative, meaning operating cash flow is negative relative to net income.\n\nFinal step: Present the ratio rounded to two decimal places:\n\n**Approximately 40.30**\n\n**Note:** If the intent is to see the proportion, often the absolute value is used, but in contexts such as this, the sign indicates the direction. Given the historical examples, they report as positive ratios.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\": \"40.30\"}}\n```",
