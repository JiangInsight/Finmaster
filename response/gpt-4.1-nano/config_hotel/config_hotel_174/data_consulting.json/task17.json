Since no long-term liabilities are specified, we proceed with current liabilities as a proxy.\n\n**Total Debt** = 3,389,719.66\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{-4,504,752.68}{3,389,719.66} \\approx -1.33\n\\]\n\nExpressed as a ratio, it is approximately **-1.33**, indicating the company's operating cash flow is negative and exceeds its current liabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-1.33\"}}\n```",
