Assuming all liabilities are current liabilities, or that no additional debt exists, total liabilities = 3,389,719.66.\n\n- Total Assets: 19,501,451.49\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{3,389,719.66}{19,501,451.49} \\approx 0.17 \\]\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Debt to Equity Ratio** = Total Liabilities / Shareholders' Equity\n\n- Total Equity: 16,111,731.83\n- Total Liabilities: 3,389,719.66 (assuming current liabilities only)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{3,389,719.66}{16,111,731.83} \\approx 0.21 \\]\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio** = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -4,504,752.68 (from cash flow statement)\n- Since no explicit long-term debt is given, we assume total debt is represented by total liabilities, i.e., 3,389,719.66\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-4,504,752.68}{3,389,719.66} \\approx -1.33 \\]\n\n(Note: The earlier example used a different value for cash flow and debt ratio, but based on our calculations, this is logical from the data provided.)\n\n---\n\n### Final constructed solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  \"Current Ratio\": \"2.69\",\n  \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.37\",\n  \"Debt to Asset Ratio\": \"0.17\",\n  \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.21\",\n  \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-1.33\"\n}}\n```",
