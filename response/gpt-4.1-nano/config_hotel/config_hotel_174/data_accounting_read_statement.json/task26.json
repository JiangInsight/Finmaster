The key expense categories are Administrative Expenses, Selling Expenses, Depreciation, Financial Expenses, and Total Expenses.\n\nStep 2: Focus on \"Financial Expenses\" because it commonly includes costs related to financing activities such as interest on borrowings, issuance costs, or other financing charges.\n\nStep 3: The amount listed for \"Financial Expenses\" is 3193.59, which is explicitly related to financing costs incurred to raise funds.\n\nTherefore, the specific financing costs are represented by the \"Financial Expenses\" amount.\n\nFinal answer: 3193.59\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"3193.59\"}}\n```",
