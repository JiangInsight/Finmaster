                        "content": "To determine the total amount of liabilities expected to be settled in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle, we need to identify the current liabilities from the balance sheet, as these are usually short-term or payable within the operating cycle.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Examine the balance sheet for liabilities listed under \"Total Current Liabilities.\"\n2. Focus on liabilities that are typically settled in the normal operating cycle, such as accounts payable and taxes payable.\n3. The initial and end values of these current liabilities are provided.\n4. Sum these current liabilities for initial and final amounts.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Initial value of Total Current Liabilities: 0.00\n- Final value of Total Current Liabilities: 3,389,719.66\n\nSince the question asks specifically for liabilities expected to be settled in the normal course of the operating cycle, and these are represented by current liabilities, the totals are:\n\n- Initial: 0.00\n- End: 3,389,719.66\n\nNow, presenting the answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"3389719.66\"}}\n```",
