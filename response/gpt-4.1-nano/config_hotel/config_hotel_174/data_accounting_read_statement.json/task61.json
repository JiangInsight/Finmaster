Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers.\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Identify costs related to securing orders and delivering goods/services**\n\n- These are typically shown as \"Selling Expenses\" (cost of sales and marketing activities) and \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (direct costs to produce goods).  \n- In the income statements, \"Selling Expenses\" and \"Cost of Goods Sold\" relate directly to the expenses of securing and delivering goods and services.\n\n**From the first dataset:**\n\n- `\"Selling Expenses\"`: 493,854.67 (latest period, same as total expenses)  \n- `\"Cost of Goods Sold\"`: 4,410,000.00  \n\n**Total costs for securing and delivering:**  \n493,854.67 + 4,410,000.00 = 4,903,854.67\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment, and other long-term assets**\n\n- These are investment activities involving cash outflows to purchase property, plant, and equipment.  \n- From the cash flow statement, the relevant line is `\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\"`.\n\nIn the first dataset:  \n- `\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\"`: 305,354.43\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Present the answer in the specified format**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"493854.67\", \"value2\": \"305354.43\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"493854.67\", \"value2\": \"305354.43\"}}\n```",
