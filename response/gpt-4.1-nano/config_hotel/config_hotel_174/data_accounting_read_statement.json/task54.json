The key cost items relevant to securing orders and delivering goods/services are typically classified under \"Selling Expenses\" and possibly \"Administrative Expenses.\"  \n2. \"Selling Expenses\" generally include costs related to sales activities and marketing efforts to secure customer orders, as well as costs involved in delivering the goods or services to customers.  \n3. \"Administrative Expenses\" may include general administrative costs not directly tied to sales or delivery.\n\nIn the provided income statement:\n\n- Selling Expenses: 9,828.84  \n- Administrative Expenses: 10,432.67\n\nSince the task specifically asks for costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services, the most relevant line item is \"Selling Expenses,\" which usually covers costs directly associated with sales activities, including costs to secure customer orders and fulfill delivery.\n\n**Therefore, the cost item is \"Selling Expenses\" with a value of 9,828.84.**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"9828.84\"}}\n```",
