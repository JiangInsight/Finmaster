Typically, these are categorized under \"Selling Expenses\" or similar accounts.\n\nIn the provided income statement, the relevant line item appears to be \"Selling Expenses,\" as it generally encompasses costs related to securing customer orders (such as sales personnel, marketing, advertising, etc.) and costs associated with delivering goods and services (such as shipping, logistics, etc.).\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Analyze the line items for expense categories.\n2. Recognize that \"Selling Expenses\" are directly associated with activities to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services.\n3. The amount listed under \"Selling Expenses\" is 9828.84.\n\nThus, the specific costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services (as represented by \"Selling Expenses\") amount to 9828.84.\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '9828.84'} }\n```",
