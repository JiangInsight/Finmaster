According to accounting standards, this is usually found under the section \"Cash flows from investing activities.\"\n\n### Step 1: Identify the relevant main line item\nFrom the provided data:\n- \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is the section of interest.\n- The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is the summary of these activities.\n\n### Step 2: Find the value of \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\"\nFrom the data:\n- \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" = -2496137.92\n\n### Step 3: Decompose the main item into sub-items\nThe main sub-item that includes the acquisition and disposal of assets and receipt of interest/dividends usually involves:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (disposals are not listed separately, so we assume only purchases)\n- Income from interest and dividends (not directly listed here, implying zero or no data on dividend/interest receipts)\n\nGiven data:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets = 2,496,137.92 (outflow, since cash paid)\n\nDividends and interest receipt are not explicitly given. The problem states it should include the \"receipt of interest and dividends,\" but these are not listed separately. Since the total \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" includes asset purchases/disposals and interest/dividends, and only purchase of fixed assets (outflow) is listed, we can conclude that the inflow from interest/dividends is zero, or at least not detailed here.\n\n### Step 4: Final answer\n- Total \"Net cash flow from investing activities\": -2,496,137.92\n- Component sub-item: Purchase of Fixed Assets = -2,496,137.92\n- Since no other sub-items are provided explicitly for interest/dividends, and \"receipt of interest and dividends\" is not listed separately, the only sub-item we can extract is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\n### Final output:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-2496137.92\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value\": \"2496137.92\"}}}\n```\n\nThis reflects the net cash used in acquiring long-term assets, which is the main component of the cash flow from investing activities as per the provided data.",
