Review the provided cash flow statement data.\n2. Locate the \"Net Profit\" line item, which represents the profit after all expenses have been deducted.\n3. The \"Net Profit\" for this period is 111,731.83.\n\nSince the problem asks for the amount of profit retained after all expenses, and the \"Net Profit\" already reflects this, the relevant figure is the \"Net Profit.\"\n\nAnswer:\n\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"111731.83\"}}",
