Typically, this is represented under \"Retained Earnings\" in the balance sheet.\n\nExamining the data:\n- Initial Retained Earnings: 0.00\n- End Retained Earnings: 111731.83\n\nSince the initial Retained Earnings is zero and the end amount is positive, this indicates that the company has retained earnings (or accumulated profit) over the period measured.\n\nTherefore, the line item of profit or loss retained in the entity is the \"Retained Earnings\" with initial value 0.00 and final value 111731.83.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '111731.83'} }\n```",
