The problem provides initial and end balances for various accounts on the balance sheet, along with the corresponding dates.\n\n2. The goal is to identify and extract the specific line items representing expenses in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, focusing on initial and final values.\n\n3. In the provided data, potential expense items are typically related to depreciation, liabilities, or other recurrent costs. \n\n4. The account that clearly signifies an expense is \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" which records depreciation expenses over time.\n\n5. The initial amount for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is 0.00, and the final amount is 117540.62â€”indicating accumulated depreciation expense recognized during the period.\n\n6. Cross-checking other accounts:\n   - Accounts payable and taxes payable are liabilities, not expenses.\n   - Retained earnings reflect profit or loss after expenses.\n   \n7. Since only \"Accumulated Depreciation\" indicates a direct expense line item with meaningful change, we conclude that the expense recognized in this period is depreciation expense.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"117540.62\"}}\n```",
