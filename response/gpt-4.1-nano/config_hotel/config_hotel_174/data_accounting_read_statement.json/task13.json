                        "content": "To identify the line items and values of total assets that are not expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle, we need to look for non-current assets (long-term assets), especially assets that are not intended for immediate sale and are unlikely to be realized within the normal operating cycle.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The total assets consist of current assets and non-current assets.\n2. Current assets (like cash, accounts receivable, inventory) are usually intended for sale or consumption within the normal operating cycle.\n3. Non-current assets (like fixed assets, long-term investments) are long-term holdings and not expected to be realized or sold in the normal operating cycle.\n4. In these statements, the relevant non-current asset line item is \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Total Non-current Assets.\"\n5. Both \"Fixed Assets\" initially and at the end are given, but the key figure for the initial value is 8,000,000.00, and the final is 10,496,137.92.\n\nTherefore, the specific line items of total assets that are not expected to be realized or consumed in the normal cycle are:\n- Fixed Assets (initial and final)\n\n**Answer:**\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10496137.92'} }",
