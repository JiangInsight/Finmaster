The amount of cash payments made to acquire property, plant, and equipment (PPE), which is typically listed under investing activities as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the net profit (or profit after all expenses):**  \n   From the table, the line \"Net Profit\" shows the value representing profit after all expenses are deducted:  \n   **Net Profit = 111,731.83**\n\n2. **Identify the cash paid for property, plant, and equipment:**  \n   Under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" the purchase of fixed assets is brought in as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which indicates the cash payments for property, plant, and equipment:  \n   **Purchase of Fixed Assets = 2,496,137.92**\n\nThe problem asks to maintain the original order of these two line items.\n\n**Final answer in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '111731.83', 'value2': '2496137.92'}}\n```",
