In the provided data, the relevant account is \"Accounts Payable.\"\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Initial value of Accounts Payable (creditors or amounts owed initially): 0.00\n2. End value of Accounts Payable (amount owed at later date): 3,350,120.00\n3. Since the initial value was zero and the final value increased to 3,350,120.00, this represents new credit obligations incurred for goods or services received that were payable.\n\nThus:\n- Initial amount owed for goods or services on credit: 0.00\n- Final amount owed for goods or services on credit: 3,350,120.00\n\nFinal answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3350120.00'}}\n```",
