In the **cash flow statement**, the line item \"Depreciation\" is listed with the amount **117540.62** for the period ending Feb 3, 2024.\n2. In the **income statement**, \"Depreciation\" appears again with the same amount **117540.62**.\n3. In the **balance sheet**, the \"Accumulated Depreciation\" increases from 0.00 to 117540.62, supporting that this is depreciation expense allocated systematically over the asset's useful life.\n\nThe consistent figure across these statements indicates the depreciation expense for the period, which is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of the asset over its useful life.\n\nTherefore, the value of the systematic allocation (depreciation expense) is **117540.62**.\n\nAnswer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '117540.62'}}\n```",
