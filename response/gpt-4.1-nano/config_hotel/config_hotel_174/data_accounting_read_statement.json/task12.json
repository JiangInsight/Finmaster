These generally include current assets such as cash, inventories, receivables, and other assets that are expected to be converted to cash or used up within a year or the operating cycle.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n\n- **Cash on Hand**: initial 3,000,000.00; end 927,447.32\n- **Bank Deposits**: initial 5,000,000.00; end 71,662.08\n- **Interest Receivable**: 0.00; end 5,264.70\n- **Accounts Receivable**: 0.00; end 248,540.09\n- **Inventory**: 0.00; end 7,869,940.00\n\nTotal current assets at initial and end are already provided as \"Total Current Assets\", which aggregate these items.\n\nSince the task asks for assets expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal operating cycle, the key line items are the current assets, specifically those components: cash, receivables, inventory, and short-term financial assets like bank deposits.\n\nNow, calculate the total value at initial and end:\n\n- **Initial total value**: provided directly as 8,000,000.00\n- **End total value**: provided directly as 9,122,854.19\n\nHence, the relevant line item \"Total Current Assets\" accurately reflects assets expected for sale or consumption within the cycle.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"9122854.19\"}}\n```",
