Look through all line items related to cash flows, especially within the \"Investing Activities\" section, because asset disposal or reduction typically appears there.\n2. In the \"Investing Activities,\" we observe the following:\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 2,496,137.92\n   - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -2,496,137.92\n\nThe \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" indicates investments in new assets, not disposal of assets. There is no explicit line items showing the sale or reduction of assets held for sale.\n\n3. Since the problem statement asks for the \"reduction in the amount of assets held for sale,\" there should be a line item indicating the sale or disposal, either as a negative cash flow under investments or as a specific line item like \"Proceeds from Sale of Assets\" or \"Reduction of Assets Held for Sale.\" \n\n4. In this case, no such transaction appears in the provided statement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- There is no explicit mention of the reduction in the amount of assets held for sale during this period.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this problem is that no such line item exists in the data provided.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"0.00\"}}\n```",
