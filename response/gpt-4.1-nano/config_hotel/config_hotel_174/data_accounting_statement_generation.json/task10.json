                        "content": "Let's analyze the transactions related to property, plant, and non-current assets:\n\n### Step 1: Identify all relevant assets\n- Initial assets:\n  - On 2023-12-31, initial non-current assets:\n    - Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.00\n    - Central AC4: 1,569,146.49\n    - Renovation Project5: 1,567,146.49\n\n- Additional purchases that could be considered non-current assets:\n  - 2023-12-31:\n    - Luxury Suite: 680,000.00\n    - Central AC4 (another): 928,991.43\n  - 2023-12-31:\n    - Banquet Set: 928,991.43 (but note this appears again, so it should be counted once if same asset)\n  - 2023-12-31:\n    - Standard Room: 315,000.00\n    - Luxury Suite (another): 1310000.00\n    - Banquet Set (another): 256,000.00\n\nIt seems the assets purchased are mainly items like luxury suites, rooms, banquet sets, and the renovation project. Some assets are repeated, but we only include each asset once. The initial assets are clearly listed.\n\n### Step 2: Sum the initial values\n- Initial total non-current assets:\n  - Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.00\n  - Central AC4: 1,569,146.49\n  - Renovation Project5: 1,567,146.49\n\nSum: 8,000,000 + 1,569,146.49 + 1,567,146.49 = **11,136,293.98**\n\n### Step 3: Sum the final amounts\n- Additional purchase totals:\n  - Luxury Suite (680,000.00)\n  - Central AC4 (928,991.43)\n  - Banquet Set (928,991.43)\n  - Standard Room (315,000.00)\n  - Luxury Suite (1,310,000.00)\n  - Banquet Set (256,000.00)\n\nAdding these:\n680,000 + 928,991.43 + 928,991.43 + 315,000 + 1,310,000 + 256,000 = **4,419,973.29**\n\n- Total assets end:\n  - Initial total: 11,136,293.98\n  - Add the purchases: 4,419,973.29\n\nSum: 11,136,293.98 + 4,419,973.29 = **15,556,267.27**\n\n**Note:** Depending on whether the second set of assets (purchases) are overlapping with initial assets or are new assets, please note that some assets like the luxury suite parts, banquet sets, and so on, are counted each time they appear with new purchase amounts. However, since the initial assets are only listed at the start, and the purchase entries seem to be additions, we sum accordingly.\n\n### Final values:\n- Initial Non-current Assets: 8,000,000.00 + properties from initial listing = 8,000,000.00 + 1,569,146.49 + 1,567,146.49 = 11,136,293.98\n- Final Non-current Assets: initial + all subsequent purchases (considered as new assets): 11,136,293.98 + 4,419,973.29 = 15,556,267.27\n\n**Rounded to two decimal places**.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '11336293.98', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '15556267.27'} }\n```",
