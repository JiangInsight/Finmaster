Gross Profit Margin**\n\nGross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 300,421.65\n- Total Revenue = 863,371.65\n\nCalculating:\nGross Profit Margin = (300,421.65 / 863,371.65) * 100 ≈ 34.78%\n\n---\n\n**2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**\n\nFirst, identify the relevant components:\n\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:**\n  From cash flow statement: -2,419,019.09\n\n- **Total Debt (Liabilities):**\n  From the balance sheet, total current liabilities are 5,515,978.61, and no non-current liabilities are shown. Total debt can be approximated as total liabilities, which include current liabilities.\n\n  Total liabilities = Total current liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n\nNow, compute the ratio:\n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) / Total Debt\n\n= -2,419,019.09 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ -0.4388\n\nExpressed as a ratio: -0.44\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Gross Profit Margin\": \"34.78%\", \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.44\"}}\n```",
