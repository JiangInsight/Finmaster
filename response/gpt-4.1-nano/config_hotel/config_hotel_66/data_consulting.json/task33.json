                        "content": "Let's analyze the data step by step to compute each ratio.\n\n**1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio**  \nFormula: Operating Cash Flow / Total Liabilities\n\n- From cash flow statement:  \n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -2,419,019.09  \n- From balance sheet:  \n  Total Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n\nNote: Since operating cash flow is negative, the ratio will also be negative.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-2,419,019.09}{5,515,978.61} \\approx -0.439\n\\]\n\n**2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**  \nTypically, Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt\n\n- Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities + Long-term Liabilities (none given), so assume total debt equals current liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n\n- Same as above, using net cash flow: -2,419,019.09\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-2,419,019.09}{5,515,978.61} \\approx -0.439\n\\]\n\n**3. Inventory Turnover Ratio**  \nFormula: Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\n- COGS = 562,950.00 (from income statement)\n- Inventory at end of period = 7,832,820.00 (from balance sheet)\n- Inventory at start = 0 (from previous balance sheet; initial inventory was zero, so assume average = end inventory for approximation)\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover} = \\frac{562,950.00}{7,832,820.00} \\approx 0.072\n\\]\n\nBut this seems very low; normally it's higher, but given the data, proceed with this.\n\n**4. Debt to Equity Ratio**  \nFormula: Total Debt / Total Owner's Equity\n\n- Total Debt (Liabilities) = 5,515,978.61  \n- Owner's Equity = 16,146,127.58\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity} = \\frac{5,515,978.61}{16,146,127.58} \\approx 0.342\n\\]\n\n**5. Quick Ratio**  \nFormula: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\n- Current Assets = 13,753,616.13  \n- Inventory = 7,832,820.00  \n- Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{13,753,616.13 - 7,832,820.00}{5,515,978.61} \\approx \\frac{5,920,796.13}{5,515,978.61} \\approx 1.073\n\\]\n\n**6. Current Ratio**  \nFormula: Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{13,753,616.13}{5,515,978.61} \\approx 2.495\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final answers in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.44\",\n    \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\": \"-0.44\",\n    \"Inventory Turnover Ratio\": \"0.072\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.34\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"1.07\",\n    \"Current Ratio\": \"2.50\"\n  }\n}\n```",
