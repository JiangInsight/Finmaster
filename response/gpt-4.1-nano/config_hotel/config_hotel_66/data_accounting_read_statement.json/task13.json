Determine which assets are not expected to be realized or for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle.\n\n**Step 1: Total Assets**  \nFrom the data, Total Assets are at \"Total Assets,\" with initial and end values being:  \n- Initial: 16,000,000.00  \n- End: 21,662,106.19\n\n**Step 2: Examine each asset line**  \n- Cash on Hand and Bank Deposits are liquid assets, expected to be realized in normal operations.  \n- Interest Receivable and Accounts Receivable are current assets; generally, they are expected to be realized in the normal course.  \n- Inventory is also a current asset, intended for sale or consumption.\n\n**Step 3: Fixed Assets and Non-current Assets**  \n- Fixed Assets remained unchanged at 8,000,000.00 initially and end.  \n- Accumulated Depreciation is a contra-asset, but is part of the non-current asset calculation, so the net fixed assets are 8,000,000.00 - 91,509.94 (depreciation). Since depreciation is accumulated and reduces the book value, but these are assets not expected for immediate saleâ€”they are used over time.\n\n**Step 4: Assets not expected to be realized or for sale in the normal operating cycle**  \nTypically, non-current assets such as property, plant, and equipment are held for long-term use, not immediate realization or sale.\n\n**Step 5: Result**  \nThe line item \"Total Non-current Assets\" reflects assets like fixed assets, which are not expected to be realized or sold in the normal operating cycle.\n\nInitial and end values:\n\n- Initial: 8,000,000.00\n- End: 7,908,490.06\n\nThis is derived from the given \"Total Non-current Assets\" line item.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '7908490.06'} }\n```",
