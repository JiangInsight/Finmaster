These costs are often categorized under selling expenses or related to cost of revenue.\n\n- \"Cost of Goods Sold\" typically relates to the costs of producing or purchasing the goods/services sold.\n- Expenses directly related to securing customer orders often fall under \"Selling Expenses.\"\n- Expenses linked to delivering goods and services, such as logistics, shipping, or other delivery-related costs, are also usually recorded under \"Selling Expenses\" or similar.\n\nIn this case, the relevant line items are:\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 562950.00\n- Selling Expenses: 7553.67\n\nAdding these together gives the total costs related to securing customer orders and delivering goods/services.\n\nCalculation:\n562950.00 + 7553.67 = 570503.67\n\nTherefore, the combined costs for securing orders and delivering goods/services amount to 570,503.67.\n\nFinal answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '570503.67'}}\n```",
