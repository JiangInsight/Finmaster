Identify the three required line items based on the instruction:\n\n   - Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities (commonly referred to as \"Total Revenue\" or similar).\n   - Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period (usually \"Cost of Goods Sold\" or similar).\n   - Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole (generally \"Administrative Expenses\" or similar).\n\n2. Find these line items in the provided data:\n\n   - **Total income:** \"Total Revenue\" with amount 863371.65.\n   - **Inventories sold:** \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with amount 562950.00.\n   - **General management/admin costs:** \"Administrative Expenses\" with amount 16809.11.\n\n3. Confirm the order in the original input statement:  \n   The order in the input is: Main Business Revenue, Total Revenue, Cost of Goods Sold, Total Cost, etc.  \n   So, the sequence is:\n\n   1. Total Revenue\n   2. Cost of Goods Sold\n   3. Administrative Expenses\n\n4. Map these to the answer keys:\n\n   - `value1`: Total income (Total Revenue) = 863371.65\n   - `value2`: Inventory cost (Cost of Goods Sold) = 562950.00\n   - `value3`: Administrative expenses = 16809.11\n\nHere's the JSON answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"863371.65\", \"value2\": \"562950.00\", \"value3\": \"16809.11\"}}\n```",
