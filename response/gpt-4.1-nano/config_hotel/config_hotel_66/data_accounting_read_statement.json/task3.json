Look for account names that typically represent amounts owed by third parties for goods or services provided on credit.\n2. The most common account for this purpose is \"Accounts Receivable,\" which records amounts receivable from customers due to credit sales.\n3. From the data, the relevant entries are:\n   - Initial amount: 0.00 (at 2023-12-31)\n   - End amount: 330,748.44 (at 2024-02-01)\n\nThis indicates that the amount owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit increased from 0 to 330,748.44 over the period.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"0.00\", \"end value\": \"330748.44\"}}\n```",
