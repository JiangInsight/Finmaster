Our goal is to identify and extract the specific line item that indicates the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period.\n\nStep 1: Look for a line that references tax.\nStep 2: The line \"Tax Expense\" is relevant because it typically represents the amount of tax payable or recoverable for the period.\nStep 3: The value associated with \"Tax Expense\" in this statement is 43168.61.\nStep 4: Therefore, the total tax amount expected to pay is 43168.61.\n\nFinal answer: The value of tax expected to pay during the reporting period is 43168.61.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '43168.61'} }\n```",
