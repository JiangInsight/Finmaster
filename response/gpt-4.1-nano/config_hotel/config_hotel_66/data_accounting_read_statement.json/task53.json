The balance sheet shows the initial and end amounts of inventories and the dates corresponding to these amounts.\n2. The cash flow statement indicates the change in inventory during the reporting period, specifically the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" line item.\n\nLet's analyze:\n\n- Initial Inventory: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- End Inventory: 7,832,820.00 (as of 2024-02-01)\n- Change in Inventory: -7,832,820.00 (a decrease) during the period\n\nIn the cash flow, the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" is -7,832,820.00, which means inventory decreased during the period, corresponding to the sale of inventories.\n\nIn the income statement, the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is 562,950.00, which represents the carrying amount of inventories sold. This amount is derived from the inventory movement and the cost associated with it.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item value of inventories sold during the reporting period is 562,950.00.\n\nAnswer in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"562950.00\"}}\n```",
