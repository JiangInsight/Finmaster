Amount of interest accrued but not yet received:**\n\n- This information is typically recorded under \"Interest Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n- In the balance sheet, the \"Interest Receivable\" at the end of the period is given as **9066.78**.\n\n- On the income statement, \"Interest Income\" is reported as **9066.78**.\n- Usually, interest accrued but not yet received is reflected in the balance sheet \"Interest Receivable\" account, which matches the interest income reported.\n\n**2. Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period:**\n\n- Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and end of the period are given in the cash flow statement.\n- Beginning balance: **8,000,000.00**\n- Ending balance: **5,580,980.91**\n\n- The net change in cash and cash equivalents = Ending balance - Beginning balance = 5,580,980.91 - 8,000,000.00 = **-2,419,019.09**\n\nThis value indicates a net decrease in cash during the period.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"9066.78\", \"value2\": \"-2419019.09\"}}\n```",
