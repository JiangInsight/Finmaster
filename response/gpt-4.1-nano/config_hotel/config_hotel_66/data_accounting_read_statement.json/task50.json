The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life:  \n   - This is represented by depreciation expense.  \n   - From the statement: **91509.94**\n\n2. Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period:  \n   - This refers to assets held for sale or in process of sale.  \n   - The closest relevant figure is \"Decrease in Inventory,\" since inventory relates to assets in production or for sale.  \n   - From the statement: **-7832820.00**\n\n3. Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends:  \n   - This corresponds to cash flows from investing activities, including asset acquisitions/disposals and investment income.  \n   - From the statement: **-0.00** (Purchase of fixed assets overall net is zero, indicating no net cash flow gained or used from investments)\n\n4. The receipt of interest and dividends:  \n   - Not explicitly shown separately in the statement.  \n   - Since no direct figure for interest or dividends received is given, but the \"Increase (Decrease) in Interest Receivable\" is provided, and in the cash flow from investing activities, the net is zero, it suggests no specified inflow of interest/dividends.  \n   - Given data, the best approximation is considering the investment cash flows, which are zero, and no direct mention of interest/dividends, so we take **-0.00**\n\n5. Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period:  \n   - From the statement: **-2419019.09**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Value 1 (Depreciation): 91509.94  \n- Value 2 (Reduction in assets held for sale/in production): -7832820.00  \n- Value 3 (Cash from acquisition/disposal of long-term assets and investments): -0.00  \n- Value 4 (Net change in cash and cash equivalents): -2419019.09\n\nNow, let's prepare the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91509.94', 'value2': '-7832820.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '-2419019.09'}}\n```",
