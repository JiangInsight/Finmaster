Income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities: This is typically \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue\" for the period.\n\n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period: This is \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\nNow, examining the data:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n|---|---|---|\n| Main Business Revenue | 863371.65 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Total Revenue | 863371.65 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 562950.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Total Cost | 562950.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Gross Profit | 300421.65 | 2024-02-01 |\n| ... | ... | ... |\n\nThe primary revenue figure related to core operations is \"Main Business Revenue\" (or \"Total Revenue\" as it equals Main Business Revenue). Since the instruction maintains the order, we select \"Main Business Revenue\" as the first line item.\n\nThe inventory sold during the period is represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\nTherefore, the extracted line items are:\n\n- Income from core activities: 863371.65\n- Inventories sold: 562950.00\n\nNow, presenting the answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"863371.65\", \"value2\": \"562950.00\"}}\n```",
