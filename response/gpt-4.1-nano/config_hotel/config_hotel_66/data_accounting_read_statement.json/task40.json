The task asks for the \"addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.\" This typically relates to accounts payable, which is a liability that increases when the entity owes more for purchases on credit.\n\n2. In the given data, the relevant line item is:\n   - **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable** with a value of **5472810.00**.\n\n3. Since this line item indicates how much the company's accounts payable increased during the period, it directly reflects the additional amount owed for goods or services received on credit.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and value are:\n\n**Line item:** Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  \n**Value:** 5472810.00\n\nFinal answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5472810.00'}}\n```",
