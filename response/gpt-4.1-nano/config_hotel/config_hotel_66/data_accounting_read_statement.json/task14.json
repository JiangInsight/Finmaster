These are typically payable within one year or within the entity's operating cycle.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Review the liability accounts listed:\n   - Accounts Payable\n   - Taxes Payable\n\n2. Confirm that both are current liabilities:\n   - Both are classified under \"Total Current Liabilities\".\n\n3. Extract their end amounts:\n   - Accounts Payable: 5,472,810.00\n   - Taxes Payable: 43,168.61\n\n4. Sum these current liabilities:\n   - 5,472,810.00 + 43,168.61 = 5,515,978.61\n\nThe problem requests the initial and final values:\n- Initial amount (at the start date): 0.00 (assuming liabilities were none or not specified initially, which aligns with initial liabilities being zero unless indicated)\n- End amount (at the end date): 5,515,978.61\n\nFinal answer in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '5515978.61'}}\n```",
