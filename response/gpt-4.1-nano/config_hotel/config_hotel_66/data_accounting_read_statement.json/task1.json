These generally include \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits,\" as they are the primary forms of cash held by a company.\n\nStep 1: Extract the initial and end values for \"Cash on Hand.\"\n- Initial amount: 3,000,000.00\n- End amount: 2,882,590.91\n\nStep 2: Extract the initial and end values for \"Bank Deposits.\"\n- Initial amount: 5,000,000.00\n- End amount: 2,698,390.00\n\nStep 3: Sum the initial values to get total initial cash.\n- Initial cash: 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 8,000,000.00\n\nStep 4: Sum the end values to get total end cash.\n- End cash: 2,882,590.91 + 2,698,390.00 = 5,580,980.91\n\nTherefore, the total cash available for use in day-to-day operations at the initial date was 8,000,000.00, and at the end date is approximately 5,580,980.91.\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '5580980.91'}}\n```",
