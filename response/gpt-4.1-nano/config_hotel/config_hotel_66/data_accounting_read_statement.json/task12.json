Current assets typically include cash, bank deposits, receivables, inventory, and other assets expected to be converted into cash or used up within one year or within the normal operating cycle.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n\n- **Cash on Hand**: initial = 3,000,000.00; end = 2,882,590.91\n- **Bank Deposits**: initial = 5,000,000.00; end = 2,698,390.00\n- **Interest Receivable**: initial = 0.00; end = 9,066.78\n- **Accounts Receivable**: initial = 0.00; end = 330,748.44\n- **Inventory**: initial = 0.00; end = 7,832,820.00\n\nTotal current assets are also given:\n- Initial = 8,000,000.00\n- End = 13,753,616.13\n\nThese are the assets that fit the criteria. The fixed assets and non-current assets are generally not expected to be realized or consumed in the normal operating cycle but are held for longer-term use.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"initial value\": \"8000000.00\", \"end value\": \"13753616.13\"}}\n```",
