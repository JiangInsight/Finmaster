The net profit (which is given as \"Net Profit\") — this reflects the profit after all expenses.\n2. The cash payment for property, plant, and equipment (which is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\") — this shows the cash outflow for acquiring long-term assets.\n\nNow, let's analyze the provided data:\n\n- \"Net Profit\" corresponds to the amount of profit retained after all expenses.\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" corresponds to cash payments made to acquire property, plant, and equipment.\n\nFrom the given data:\n\n- Net Profit = 146127.58\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets = 0.00\n\nSince the question asks for these two values in order, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '146127.58', 'value2': '0.00'}}\n```",
