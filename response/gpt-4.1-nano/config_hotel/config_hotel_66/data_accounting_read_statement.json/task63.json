                        "content": "Let's analyze each financial statement and extract the required line items:\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**:\n   - The balance sheet includes the total amount of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period.\n   - From the balance sheet, \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" is directly listed as \"Ending Balance\" in the previous statement, which is **5580980.91**.\n\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - The line item for total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities is generally the **Total Revenue** or **Total Income**.\n   - Here, \"Total Revenue\" is **863371.65**.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - The cash flows from principal revenue-producing activities are captured under \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\".\n   - This value is **-2419019.09**.\n\n4. **Other activities that are not investing or financing**:\n   - These are identified by looking at tax-related and profit components.\n   - The amount of taxes accrued but not yet paid is **Tax Expense**: **43168.61**.\n   - The total income arising in the course of the entity's ordinary activities is effectively represented by \"Profit Before Tax\" and \"Net Profit\".\n   - Since \"Total income arising in the course\" usually refers to gross income before taxes, the best match is \"Profit Before Tax\", which is **189296.19**.\n\n**Summary of extracted values:**\n\n- Cash and cash equivalents generated from entity activities: **5580980.91**\n- Total income in ordinary activities: **863371.65**\n- Taxes accrued but not yet paid: **43168.61**\n- Total income arising in the course of ordinary activities: **189296.19**\n\nHowever, the task asks for three specific line items:\n\n1. The net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities that are principal revenue-producing activities: **Net cash flow from operating activities**, which is **-2419019.09**.\n2. The amount of taxes accrued but not yet paid: **Tax Expense**: **43168.61**.\n3. Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities: **Net Profit**: **146127.58** (since net profit is the income after taxes).\n\n**Note:** The first point should focus on cash flow in the cash flow statement, the second on taxes payable, and the third on total income in the income statement.\n\n### Final choices:\n\n- **Cash and cash equivalents (generated from activities):** → from cash flow statement: **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities** = **-2419019.09**\n- **Taxes payable (accrued but not paid):** → from balance sheet: **Taxes Payable** = **43168.61**\n- **Total income from activities:** → from income statement: **Net Profit** = **146127.58**\n\n---\n\n### Final answer in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"-2419019.09\", \"value2\": \"43168.61\", \"value3\": \"146127.58\"}}\n```",
