This is the net cash inflow/outflow from investments, satisfying the criteria.\n\nStep 5: Decompose into sub-items\n\n- The prompt asks for sub-items, which, in this case, can be:\n  - Purchase of Fixed Assets (disposal or acquisition of long-term assets)\n  - Any receipt of interest and dividends (not directly listed here â€” the data doesn't specify interest or dividend receipts separately in investing; they are typically part of operating activities unless otherwise specified).\n\n- Since no other investing sub-items are given, and only \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is present, the overall net flow is effectively driven by that.\n\n- The asset purchase is a sub-item; since there's no sale or dividend receipt data, the total net is essentially that.\n\nNow, presenting the final answer.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value\": \"-0.00\",\n    \"sub_item_value\": \"0.00\"\n  }\n}\n```",
