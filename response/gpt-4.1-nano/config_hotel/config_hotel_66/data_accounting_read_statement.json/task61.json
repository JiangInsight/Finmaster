                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided financial statements carefully to extract the two specific line items and their values.\n\nStep 1: Identify the line item for costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services (i.e., selling-related costs).  \n- Typically, these are found under selling expenses or similar line items in the income statement.  \n- In the income statement, \"Selling Expenses\" is present: for example, in one report, it is 493,854.67; in the other, 7,553.67.  \n- Since the task specifies \"costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services,\" these are often recognized as \"Selling Expenses\" or similar.\n\nStep 2: Identify the cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment, and other long-term assets.  \n- These are usually found in the cash flow statement under investing activities, labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"  \n- In the cash flow statements, \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" appears, with amounts: 305,354.43 and 0.00 in the two periods.\n\nStep 3: Confirm the grouping order.  \n- For the line item related to costs incurred to secure and deliver goods/services, I choose \"Selling Expenses\" from the income statement.  \n- For the cash payments to acquire property, plant, and long-term assets, I choose \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" from the investing activities in cash flow.\n\nFrom the first scenario's data:\n- Selling Expenses: 493,854.67\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 305,354.43\n\nFrom the second scenario's data:\n- Selling Expenses: 7,553.67\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 0.00\n\nSince the question asks for the two line items and their values, I will provide the values from the first scenario as an example, aligning with the pattern of previous solutions.\n\nFinal Answer:\n- Line item 1 (costs to secure orders and deliver goods/services): Selling Expenses = 493,854.67\n- Line item 2 (cash payments to acquire property, plant, equipment): Purchase of Fixed Assets = 305,354.43\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value1\": \"493854.67\", \"value2\": \"305354.43\"}}\n```",
