Look at the \"balance sheet\" section to identify changes in liabilities related to accounts payable.\n2. The \"End_amount\" for \"Accounts Payable\" increased from 0.00 to 5,472,810.00.\n3. The increase (addition) in accounts payable during the period is 5,472,810.00, which indicates new credit purchases that the entity owes.\n\n4. The \"cash flow\" statement confirms this increase:\n   - \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is 5,472,810.00.\n   \nThis figure reflects the addition (i.e., new credit purchases) during the period.\n\nTherefore, the specific line item is \"Accounts Payable,\" and the amount of addition (increase) during the period is 5,472,810.00.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5472810.00'}}\n```",
