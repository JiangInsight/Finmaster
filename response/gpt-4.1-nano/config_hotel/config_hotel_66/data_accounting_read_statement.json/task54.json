                        "content": "To identify the costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services, we need to look at relevant expense line items in the income statement, as these typically record such costs.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Costs to secure customer orders typically fall under \"Selling Expenses\" or \"Sales and Marketing Expenses.\" These include advertising, sales commissions, and other marketing costs aimed at gaining customer orders.\n2. Costs to deliver goods and services are usually included in \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS), since they directly relate to producing or delivering the products/services.\n3. In the provided income statement, \"Selling Expenses\" at 7553.67 relate to the costs of securing customer orders.\n4. \"Cost of Goods Sold\" at 562950.00 relate to the costs of delivering the goods.\n\nThe task asks for the specific line item and value of costs incurred for these purposes combined. Often, companies combine the costs of sales and related efforts into a total selling and delivery expense, but the problem likely expects the sum of the key relevant items.\n\nHowever, the specific line item “Selling Expenses” is the most directly associated with costs to secure customer orders (selling efforts) and possibly some aspects of delivery.\n\nGiven the problem and examples, most focus is on the key expense line item that relates to both securing orders and delivering goods, which in this context is:\n\n- \"Selling Expenses\" for securing orders.\n- \"Cost of Goods Sold\" for delivering the goods.\n\nBut because the example solution has only one value, and the typical practice is to consider \"Selling Expenses\" as covering costs for acquiring customers, I will choose \"Selling Expenses\" as the most relevant line.\n\nThus, the answer is the value of Selling Expenses in the income statement:\n\n**Value: 7553.67**\n\n---\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '7553.67'} }\n```",
