To confirm, we look for:\n   - **Gross Profit**: 300,421.65\n   - **Total Expenses**: 120,192.24\n   - **Interest Income**: 9,066.78\n\n3. **Decompose this item into 4 component sub-items**:\n   From the input, relevant components that would contribute to profit before tax are:\n   - Gross Profit (initial value): 300,421.65\n   - Total Expenses (initial value): 120,192.24\n   - Interest Income (initial value): 9,066.78\n   - Any other relevant expense or income that influences profit before tax, such as Depreciation or Financial Expenses.\n\n   Considering the first three are straightforward, the last component could be **Financial Expenses + Depreciation**:\n   - **Depreciation**: 91,509.94\n   - **Financial Expenses**: 4,319.52\n\n   Including these, the four sub-items from the statement are:\n   - Main Business Revenue: 863,371.65\n   - Total Cost: 562,950.00\n   - Total Expenses: 120,192.24\n   - Interest Income: 9,066.78\n\n   These can be used as the sub-items to decompose the profit before tax.\n\n4. **Final step**:\n   - Initial value of profit before tax: 189,296.19\n   - Sub-items values:\n     - Main Business Revenue: 863,371.65\n     - Total Cost: 562,950.00\n     - Total Expenses: 120,192.24\n     - Interest Income: 9,066.78\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"189296.19\", \"sub_items_sub_item value1\": \"863371.65\", \"sub_items_sub_item value2\": \"562950.00\", \"sub_items_sub_item value3\": \"120192.24\", \"sub_items_sub_item value4\": \"9066.78\"}}\n```",
