                        "content": "Let's analyze the provided financial statements to identify the two specific line items:\n\n1. End value of funds deposited into a bank.\n2. Income earned by the entity from financial assets.\n\n**Step 1: Find the end value of funds deposited into a bank**\n\nIn the **Balance Sheet** sections, look for accounts related to bank deposits or cash equivalents at the end date.\n\n- In the first problem:\n  - Bank Deposits (End_amount): 164,645.57\n- In the second problem:\n  - Bank Deposits (End_amount): 2,698,390.00\n\nBut the prompt asks specifically for the amount of funds deposited into a bank. The common account for this would be \"Bank Deposits\" (or similar), which directly reflects bank account balances.\n\n**Step 2: Find the income earned from financial assets**\n\nIncome from financial assets usually appears as \"Interest Income\" or similar.\n\n- In the first problem:\n  - Income from financial assets: Interest Income = 2672.87\n- In the second problem:\n  - Interest Income = 9066.78\n\nSince the task is to extract the **two specific line items** and their **end values**, and within each group maintain original order, we focus on:\n\n- For the **Balance Sheet**, the \"Bank Deposits\" end amount.\n- For the **Income Statement**, the \"Interest Income.\"\n\n**Step 3: Compile the results**\n\nFrom the first problem:\n- Funds deposited into a bank (Bank Deposits): 164,645.57\n- Income from financial assets (Interest Income): 2672.87\n\nFrom the second problem:\n- Funds deposited into a bank (Bank Deposits): 2,698,390.00\n- Income from financial assets (Interest Income): 9066.78\n\nThe example output groups multiple results (for multiple problems). Therefore, the response should contain all relevant values from both problems.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value1\": \"164645.57, 2698390.00\",\n    \"value2\": \"2672.87, 9066.78\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis groups the bank deposit values (end balance) and income from financial assets (interest income) for both cases in the correct format.",
