Typically, this is represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS). In the provided income statement, the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (or similar) directly reflects the carrying amount of inventories sold during the period.\n\nExamining the data:\n- \"Cost of Goods Sold\" = 562950.00\n\nTherefore, the specific line item and value of inventories sold during the period is 562950.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"562950.00\"}}\n```",
