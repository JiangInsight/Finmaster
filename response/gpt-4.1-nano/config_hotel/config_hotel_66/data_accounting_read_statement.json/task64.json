From the **Balance Sheet**:\n- The problem specifies: \"the end value of profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense\" â€” this is **Profit Before Tax**.\n- The relevant account is usually labeled as \"Profit Before Tax\" or similar; here, it is explicitly labeled as **Profit Before Tax**.\n- The **end value** of that is **189296.19** (from the income statement section, aligned with the period end date 2024-02-01).\n\n### 2. From the **Income Statement**:\n- The second item is \"the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.\"\n- This is typically reflected as an increase in Accounts Payable during the period.\n- Looking at the cash flow statement, the relevant change is **\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\"**.\n- Given the period end date, the increase in Accounts Payable is **5472810.00**.\n\n### 3. Also, from the **Income Statement**:\n- The third item is \"capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares.\"\n- This is usually reflected in the equity section as Paid-in Capital.\n- The balance at period end for Paid-in Capital is **16000000.00**.\n\n### Final selection:\n- Value1: Profit Before Tax (Balance Sheet): **189296.19**\n- Value2: Addition in credit for goods/services (Increase in Accounts Payable): **5472810.00**\n- Value3: Capital contributed by shareholders (Paid-in Capital): **16000000.00**\n\n### JSON output:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '189296.19', 'value2': '5472810.00', 'value3': '16000000.00'}}\n```",
