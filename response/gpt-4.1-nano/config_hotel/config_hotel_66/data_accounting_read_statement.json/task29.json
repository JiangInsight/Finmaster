The total income arising in the course of the entity's ordinary activities is typically represented by \"Total Revenue.\"\n\n2. From the data:\n   - Total Revenue = 863371.65\n\n3. Next, decomposing total income into sub-items, the primary component is generally \"Main Business Revenue,\" which is a main contributor to total revenue.\n\n4. In the data:\n   - Main Business Revenue = 863371.65\n\n5. We note that the \"Total Revenue\" is equal to \"Main Business Revenue,\" so the sub-item is \"Main Business Revenue,\" with the same value.\n\n6. Since the task requires decomposing into one component sub-item originating from the statement, and the total revenue equals main business revenue, the decomposition is straightforward.\n\nFinal step: Prepare the JSON-format answer.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"863371.65\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item_value\": \"863371.65\"}}}\n```",
