The **balance sheet** section shows the initial amounts, including a row labeled \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\". These typically represent the cash and cash equivalents at the start of the period.\n\n2. The **cash flow statement** explicitly mentions \"Beginning Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents,\" which confirms the initial cash position.\n\n3. In the first problem, the initial amounts are:\n   - Cash on Hand: 3,000,000.00\n   - Bank Deposits: 5,000,000.00\n\n4. The total initial cash and cash equivalents would be the sum of these amounts unless specified otherwise.\n\nHowever, the easiest and most precise approach is to use the \"Beginning Balance\" of \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" from the cash flow statement for the initial period, which is 8,000,000.00.\n\nConclusion:\n\n- The specific line item is \"Beginning Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\".\n- The value is 8,000,000.00.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
