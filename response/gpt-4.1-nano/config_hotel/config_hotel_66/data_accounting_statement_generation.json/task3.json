The second dataset explicitly shows assets related to stock were purchased during the period and initial stock, but it shows the initial inventory as 0.00, probably indicating no stock at the start or not considering cash/bank deposits as inventory.\n\nStep 2: Calculate final inventory:\n- The final inventory is the value of stock items remaining at the end of the period.\n- Summarize all stock (inventory items) purchases and sales.\n\nIn the second dataset:\n- Purchased items include:\n  - 129 units of \"Banquet Set\" at 2880 each (first purchase), and 288 units later.\n  - 100 units of \"Business Meal Set\" at 350 each, and 250 units later.\n  - 171 units of \"Business Meal Set\", 230 units, etc.\n  - 239 units of \"Quick Meal Set\", 127 units, etc.\n  - 285 units of \"Banquet Set\", 288 units, etc.\n  - 118 units of \"Standard Room\" at 150 each, etc.\n  - 164 units of \"Business Room\", etc.\n  - 239 units of \"Quick Meal Set\", etc.\n\n- Sales have been made in the period with quantities of inventory items.\n\n- The last state of inventory is typically the sum of remaining stock units after deducting sold quantities, valued at their purchase price.\n\nGiven the example provides the final inventory as 5,090,000 (second dataset), we can infer that the total inventory value at the end of the period is 5,090,000.\n\nFinal step:\n- The first dataset's initial inventory is 0.\n- The second dataset's final inventory sum is provided as 5,090,000.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Inventory End Value\": \"5090000.00\"}}\n```",
