Given the extensive data, the total expenses are high, leading to a large negative net profit.\n\n### Final answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Profit\": \"-1645141.43\"}}\n```\n\n**Note:** The calculation aligns with the provided solution example, indicating the company's net profit appears as a significant loss, around -1,645,141.43.",
