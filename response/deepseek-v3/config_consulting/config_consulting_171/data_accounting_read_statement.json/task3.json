This is typically labeled as \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item \"Accounts Receivable\" represents amounts owed to the entity by customers for goods or services sold on credit. This is the item we are interested in.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value and Date**:\n   - In the given balance sheet, the \"Accounts Receivable\" line shows an \"Initial_amount\" of `0.00` with an \"Initial_date\" of `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value and Date**:\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Accounts Receivable\" is `2984071.72` with an \"End_date\" of `2024-02-05`.\n\n4. **Verify the Data**:\n   - The initial value is `0.00`, which means there were no receivables at the start of the period.\n   - The end value is `2984071.72`, which represents the amount owed to the entity at the end of the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '2984071.72'} }\n```",
