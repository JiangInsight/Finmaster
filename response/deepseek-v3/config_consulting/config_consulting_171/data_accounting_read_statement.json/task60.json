I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the correct answers.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe're given three financial statements: a Balance Sheet, a Cash Flow statement, and an Income Statement. The task is to:\n\n1. **Identify and extract two specific line items**:\n   - The end value of funds deposited into a bank.\n   - The income earned by an entity from financial assets.\n\n2. **Group these by financial statement in the order**:\n   1. Balance Sheet\n   2. Income Statement\n   3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n3. **Within each group, maintain the original line item order** as shown in the input statement.\n\nFrom the example provided, the two values extracted were:\n- `'value1': '164645.57'` (Bank Deposits from Balance Sheet)\n- `'value2': '2672.87'` (Interest Income from Income Statement)\n\nThis suggests that:\n- \"Funds deposit into a bank\" corresponds to \"Bank Deposits\" in the Balance Sheet.\n- \"Income earned from financial assets\" corresponds to \"Interest Income\" in the Income Statement.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nNow, let's look at the current problem's financial statements to find these two items.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet table, we're interested in \"Bank Deposits\":\n\n| Account | Initial_amount | Initial_date | End_amount | End_date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bank Deposits | 5000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 3079000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThe \"End_amount\" for Bank Deposits is `3079000.00`. This would be our first value.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nNext, in the Income Statement, we look for \"Interest Income\":\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Interest Income | 13279.60 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThe amount for Interest Income is `13279.60`. This would be our second value.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nThe example didn't use the Cash Flow statement, and based on the description, we're only extracting two values corresponding to the first two statements. So, we can ignore the Cash Flow statement for this extraction.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nJust to ensure I'm on the right track, let's verify with the example:\n\n- Example's Balance Sheet had \"Bank Deposits\" with End_amount `164645.57` → `value1`.\n- Income Statement had \"Interest Income\" `2672.87` → `value2`.\n\nThis matches the pattern I'm following.\n\n### Potential Confusions\n\nCould there be other interpretations?\n\n- \"Funds deposit into a bank\": Is this strictly \"Bank Deposits\" in the Balance Sheet? It seems so, as other items like \"Cash on Hand\" are separate.\n  \n- \"Income earned from financial assets\": Financial assets can generate interest, dividends, etc. Here, \"Interest Income\" seems the direct match. There's no \"Dividend Income\" or similar, so \"Interest Income\" is the clear choice.\n\n### Final Extraction\n\nFrom the current problem:\n\n1. **Bank Deposits (Balance Sheet)**:\n   - End_amount: `3079000.00`\n\n2. **Interest Income (Income Statement)**:\n   - Amount: `13279.60`\n\nNo relevant items in Cash Flow for this extraction.\n\n### Formatting the Answer\n\nThe solution should be in JSON format with `value1` and `value2`:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3079000.00', 'value2': '13279.60'} }\n```\n\n### Double-Checking\n\nLet me quickly check:\n\n- `value1`: Bank Deposits' end amount is indeed `3079000.00`.\n- `value2`: Interest Income is `13279.60`.\n\nNo other values seem to fit better. The order is correct as per the financial statement sequence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully analyzing each financial statement and comparing with the given example, the correct values to extract are clear.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3079000.00', 'value2': '13279.60'} }\n```",
