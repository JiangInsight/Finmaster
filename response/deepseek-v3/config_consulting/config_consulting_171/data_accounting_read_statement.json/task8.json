This typically refers to \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet, as it represents the amounts owed to suppliers or vendors for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - Look for \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet, as this is the standard line item for amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" and \"Initial_date\" columns provide the starting value and date for the line item.\n   - The \"End_amount\" and \"End_date\" columns provide the ending value and date for the line item.\n\n3. **Locate the Values in the Given Problem**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, \"Accounts Payable\" has:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: 381000.00 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n4. **Verify the Context**:\n   - The task specifically asks for amounts owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit, which aligns with \"Accounts Payable\". Other line items like \"Taxes Payable\" or \"Total Current Liabilities\" are not relevant here.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '381000.00'} }\n```",
