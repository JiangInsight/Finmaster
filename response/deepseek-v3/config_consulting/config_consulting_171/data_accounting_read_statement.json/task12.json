These are typically the current assets.\n\nFrom the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of all assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within one year or the operating cycle, whichever is longer. \n\nHere are the steps to identify the solution:\n\n1. **Identify Current Assets**: The \"Total Current Assets\" line item includes cash on hand, bank deposits, interest receivable, accounts receivable, and inventory. These are all assets that are expected to be realized or consumed in the normal operating cycle.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**: \n   - The initial value of \"Total Current Assets\" is `8000000.00` as of `2023-12-31`.\n   - The end value of \"Total Current Assets\" is `10619895.35` as of `2024-02-05`.\n\n3. **Verify**: The initial and end values are directly taken from the \"Total Current Assets\" line in the balance sheet, which matches the criteria of assets expected to be realized or consumed in the normal operating cycle.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10619895.35'} }\n```",
