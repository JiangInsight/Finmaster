This is captured by the \"Accounts Payable\" line in the cash flow statement, as it shows the change in the amount the entity owes to its suppliers or creditors.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is present under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section. The amount associated with this line item is the value we need.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value for \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is `381000.00`.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The value is positive, indicating an increase in accounts payable, which aligns with the task description of identifying the addition in the amount owed.\n\n5. **Final Answer**: The value to be extracted is `381000.00`.\n\nHere is the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '381000.00'}}\n```",
