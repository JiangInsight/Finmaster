This line item is typically labeled as \"Depreciation\" in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Locate the Operating Activities Section**: The cash flow statement is divided into operating, investing, and financing activities. The depreciation expense is usually listed under the operating activities section.\n2. **Identify the Depreciation Line Item**: Look for the line item labeled \"Depreciation\" in the operating activities section.\n3. **Extract the Value**: Once the \"Depreciation\" line item is found, note the corresponding amount listed in the \"Amount\" column.\n\n### Application to the Given Problem:\n- In the provided cash flow statement, under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\", there is a line item labeled \"Depreciation\" with an amount of \"91505.05\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91505.05'}}\n```",
