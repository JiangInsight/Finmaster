The key line items we are interested in are those related to taxes.\n\n2. **Identify the Tax Line Item**: In the given income statement, the line item \"Tax Expense\" represents the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay or recover during the reporting period.\n\n3. **Locate the Tax Expense Value**: The value associated with \"Tax Expense\" is \"243988.48\" as shown in the table.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The \"Tax Expense\" is listed after \"Profit Before Tax\" and before \"Net Profit,\" which is the standard order in an income statement. This confirms that \"Tax Expense\" is indeed the correct line item to extract.\n\n5. **Extract the Value**: The value to be extracted is \"243988.48\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '243988.48'}}\n```",
