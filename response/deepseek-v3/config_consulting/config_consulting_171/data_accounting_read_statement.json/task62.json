                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we need.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to identify and extract three specific line items from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit**: This typically refers to \"Accounts Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet.\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually \"Financial Expenses\" in the Income Statement.\n3. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is often \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThe order to present these is:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n### Step 1: Balance Sheet - Accounts Receivable\nLooking at the Balance Sheet provided, we have the following line:\n\n| Account | Initial_amount | Initial_date | End_amount | End_date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Accounts Receivable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 2984071.72 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThe \"End_amount\" for \"Accounts Receivable\" is **2984071.72**. This is the amount owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit.\n\n### Step 2: Income Statement - Financial Expenses\nNow, let's look at the Income Statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Financial Expenses | 67135.35 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nHere, \"Financial Expenses\" are **67135.35**. These are the costs incurred to raise funds.\n\n### Step 3: Cash Flow Statement - Purchase of Fixed Assets\nFinally, examining the Cash Flow Statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThe \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is **0.00**, indicating no cash payments were made to acquire long-term assets during this period.\n\n### Verifying the Order\nJust to ensure we're following the correct order:\n1. Balance Sheet (Accounts Receivable)\n2. Income Statement (Financial Expenses)\n3. Cash Flow Statement (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2984071.72', 'value2': '67135.35', 'value3': '0.00'}}\n```\n\n### Double-Checking\nLet me quickly verify each value to ensure no mistakes:\n- **value1**: Accounts Receivable end amount is indeed 2,984,071.72.\n- **value2**: Financial Expenses are correctly 67,135.35.\n- **value3**: Purchase of Fixed Assets is correctly 0.00.\n\nEverything checks out! \n\n### Conclusion\nAfter carefully reviewing each financial statement and identifying the relevant line items, the extracted values are correctly placed in the specified order. \n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2984071.72', 'value2': '67135.35', 'value3': '0.00'}}\n```",
