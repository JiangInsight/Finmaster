Common expense-related items in the balance sheet include:\n   - **Accumulated Depreciation**: This represents the total depreciation expense accumulated over time for fixed assets.\n   - **Taxes Payable**: This could relate to tax expenses.\n   - **Retained Earnings**: Changes here could reflect net profit or loss, but this is a residual figure, not an expense itself.\n\n2. **Analyze the Given Balance Sheet**:\n   - **Accumulated Depreciation**: This is a clear expense-related item. It shows how much depreciation has been charged against fixed assets.\n     - Initial value: `0.00` (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End value: `91505.05` (as of 2024-02-05)\n   - **Taxes Payable**: This could reflect tax expenses, but it is a liability, not an expense line item directly.\n   - No other explicit expense items (like \"Salaries Payable\" or \"Interest Expense\") are listed in the balance sheet.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The most relevant expense-related item in the balance sheet is \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" as it directly ties to the depreciation expense in the profit or loss statement.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '91505.05'} }\n```",
