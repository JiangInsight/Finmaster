                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we need: \n\n1. **Amounts of taxes accrued but not yet paid** (This should be in the Balance Sheet under \"Taxes Payable\").\n2. **Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities** (This should be in the Income Statement, likely under \"Total Revenue\").\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities** (This should be in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\").\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, we're interested in \"Taxes Payable\" because that represents taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid. \n\nFrom the table:\n- **Taxes Payable**: End_amount is `243988.48`.\n\nSo, `value1` is `243988.48`.\n\n### 2. Income Statement\nNow, let's look at the Income Statement for the total income from ordinary activities. This is typically the total revenue generated from the main operations of the business.\n\nFrom the table:\n- **Total Revenue**: Amount is `4879769.51`.\n\nSo, `value2` is `4879769.51`.\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nFinally, we need the net cash flow from operating activities from the Cash Flow Statement. This represents the net cash generated from the entity's principal revenue-producing activities.\n\nFrom the table:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: Amount is `-862455.97`.\n\nSo, `value3` is `-862455.97`.\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe order specified is:\n1. Balance Sheet (`value1`: Taxes Payable)\n2. Income Statement (`value2`: Total Revenue)\n3. Cash Flow Statement (`value3`: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities)\n\nThis matches the order we've extracted the values in.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '243988.48', 'value2': '4879769.51', 'value3': '-862455.97'}}\n```",
