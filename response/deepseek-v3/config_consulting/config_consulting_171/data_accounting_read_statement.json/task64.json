                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we need.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific values from the financial statements:\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under \"Paid-in Capital\" or similar.\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is usually the \"Profit Before Tax\" line in the Income Statement.\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This is the increase in \"Accounts Payable\" from the Balance Sheet or Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThe order to present them is:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet - Capital Contributed by Shareholders\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, there's a line item called \"Paid-in Capital\". This represents the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares.\n\n- **Initial_amount**: 13000000.00\n- **End_amount**: 13000000.00\n\nSince there's no change, the capital contributed is still 13000000.00.\n\n**Value1**: '13000000.00'\n\n### 2. Income Statement - Profit Before Tax\nNow, let's look at the Income Statement. We need the profit or loss before tax expense.\n\nThere's a line item called \"Profit Before Tax\" with an amount of \"2147390.30\".\n\n**Value2**: '2147390.30'\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement - Increase in Accounts Payable\nNext, we need the increase in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period. This is the increase in \"Accounts Payable\".\n\nIn the Cash Flow Statement, there's a line:\n\"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with an amount of \"381000.00\".\n\nThis represents the addition to accounts payable during the period.\n\n**Value3**: '381000.00'\n\nAlternatively, we could look at the Balance Sheet's \"Accounts Payable\":\n- Initial_amount: 0.00\n- End_amount: 381000.00\nThe increase is 381000.00 - 0.00 = 381000.00, which matches the Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe order is:\n1. Balance Sheet (Paid-in Capital)\n2. Income Statement (Profit Before Tax)\n3. Cash Flow Statement (Increase in Accounts Payable)\n\nThis matches the required order.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '2147390.30', 'value3': '381000.00'}}\n```\n\n### Cross-Checking with the Example\nLooking back at the provided example to ensure consistency:\n- Their 'value1' was '13000000.00' (Paid-in Capital)\n- 'value2' was '-1373590.51' (Profit Before Tax)\n- 'value3' was '1590000.00' (Increase in Accounts Payable)\n\nOur approach matches theirs, just with different numbers.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter carefully reviewing each financial statement and identifying the relevant line items, the correct values are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '2147390.30', 'value3': '381000.00'}}\n```",
