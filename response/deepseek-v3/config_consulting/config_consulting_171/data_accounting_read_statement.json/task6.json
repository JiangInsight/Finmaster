These items are typically categorized under \"Fixed Assets\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The balance sheet provided includes a line item labeled \"Fixed Assets,\" which represents tangible items used in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes.\n   - The \"Fixed Assets\" line item is found under the \"Non-current Assets\" section.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Fixed Assets\" is given as `5000000.00` with the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Fixed Assets\" is given as `5000000.00` with the end date `2024-02-05`.\n   - Note that the \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is a separate line item that reduces the net value of fixed assets over time. However, the task asks for the value of the tangible items themselves, not their net value after depreciation. Therefore, we use the \"Fixed Assets\" value directly.\n\n4. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The initial and end values for \"Fixed Assets\" are consistent (`5000000.00`), indicating no change in the gross value of these assets during the period. The depreciation is accounted for separately under \"Accumulated Depreciation.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5000000.00'} }\n```",
