                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through the cash flow statement provided and identify the four specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nFirst, let's recap what we're supposed to extract based on the task description:\n\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This refers to \"Depreciation.\"\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period**: This refers to changes in \"Inventory,\" specifically \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory.\"\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends**: This is typically the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\"\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nNow, let's find these items in the provided cash flow statement.\n\n### Analyzing the Cash Flow Statement\n\nHere's the cash flow statement we're working with:\n\n```\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit  | 1903401.82 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation  | 91505.05 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -2984071.72 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -13279.60 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -485000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 381000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 243988.48 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -862455.97 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Ending Balance  | 7137544.03 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Increase  | -862455.97 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\n\nNow, let's extract each of the four required values:\n\n1. **Depreciation**: This is straightforward. It's listed as \"Depreciation\" with an amount of `91505.05`.\n   \n2. **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**: This is listed as `-485000.00`. The negative sign indicates an increase in inventory (since it's a cash outflow), which aligns with the description of a reduction in assets held for sale or in production.\n\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: This is given as `-0.00`. Even though it's zero, it's the net result of investing activities, which includes purchases of fixed assets and other investments.\n\n4. **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: This is the \"Net Increase\" at the bottom, which is `-862455.97`. This represents the overall change in cash during the period.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the provided example to ensure we're on the right track:\n\n- `value1` was \"Depreciation\" (`45751.41`).\n- `value2` was \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" (`-5090000.00`).\n- `value3` was \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" (`-305354.43`).\n- `value4` was \"Net Increase\" (`-7565348.53`).\n\nThis matches our understanding, so we're good to proceed.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling the values we've identified:\n\n- `value1` (Depreciation): `91505.05`\n- `value2` ((Increase) Decrease in Inventory): `-485000.00`\n- `value3` (Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities): `-0.00`\n- `value4` (Net Increase): `-862455.97`\n\nPutting this into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91505.05', 'value2': '-485000.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '-862455.97'} }\n```\n\n### Double-Checking\n\nJust to be thorough, let's quickly verify each:\n\n1. **Depreciation**: Yes, `91505.05` is correct.\n2. **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**: `-485000.00` is present in the table.\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: It's `-0.00`, which might seem odd, but the table shows no purchases (0.00) leading to a net of `-0.00`.\n4. **Net Increase**: Matches the \"Net Increase\" line at `-862455.97`.\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91505.05', 'value2': '-485000.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '-862455.97'} }\n```",
