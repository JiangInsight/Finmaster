I'm going to look at the income statement provided and identify the three specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific pieces of information from the income statement:\n\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities**: This typically refers to the total revenue generated from the main operations of the business. In income statements, this is often labeled as \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is essentially the cost associated with the goods that were sold during the period. In accounting terms, this is commonly referred to as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**: These are the expenses related to managing and administering the entire business. In the income statement, these are usually listed as \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n\n### Analyzing the Given Income Statement\nLet's look at the provided income statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 4879769.51 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Revenue | 4879769.51 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 2018000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Cost | 2018000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Gross Profit | 2861769.51 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 294758.34 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Selling Expenses | 274260.07 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation | 91505.05 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Financial Expenses | 67135.35 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Expenses | 727658.81 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Interest Income | 13279.60 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 2147390.30 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Tax Expense | 243988.48 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit | 1903401.82 | 2024-02-05 |\n\n### Identifying the Required Line Items\n\n1. **Total income from ordinary activities**:\n   - Both \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\" are listed with the same amount (4879769.51). \n   - \"Total Revenue\" is a more comprehensive term that likely includes all revenues from ordinary activities, so we'll use \"Total Revenue\" for this.\n   - **Value**: 4879769.51\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold (Cost of Goods Sold)**:\n   - Directly listed as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with the amount 2018000.00.\n   - **Value**: 2018000.00\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration**:\n   - Listed as \"Administrative Expenses\" with the amount 294758.34.\n   - **Value**: 294758.34\n\n### Verifying Against the Example\nLooking at the example provided:\n\n- `value1` was \"Total Revenue\" (5431018.59)\n- `value2` was \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (4410000.00)\n- `value3` was \"Administrative Expenses\" (1425164.20)\n\nThis confirms our approach is correct.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the above reasoning, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '4879769.51', 'value2': '2018000.00', 'value3': '294758.34'} }\n```",
