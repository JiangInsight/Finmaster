                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to identify and extract the four specific line items from the given balance sheet based on the task description. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract four specific line items and their corresponding initial and end amounts:\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received**: This is typically listed as \"Interest Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n2. **Accumulated systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is \"Accumulated Depreciation\".\n3. **Tax payable**: This is \"Taxes Payable\".\n4. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is \"Paid-in Capital\".\n\n### Identifying the Line Items\nNow, let's go through the provided balance sheet and find these items:\n\n1. **Interest Receivable**:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - End_amount: 13279.60\n\n2. **Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - End_amount: 91505.05\n\n3. **Taxes Payable**:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - End_amount: 243988.48\n\n4. **Paid-in Capital**:\n   - Initial_amount: 13000000.00\n   - End_amount: 13000000.00\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe task mentions maintaining the original line item order as shown in the input statement. Looking at the balance sheet, the order is:\n- Interest Receivable\n- Accumulated Depreciation\n- Taxes Payable\n- Paid-in Capital\n\nThis matches the order in which we've listed them above.\n\n### Preparing the Solution\nNow, let's map these to the required JSON format:\n- 'initial value1': Interest Receivable initial amount\n- 'end valu1': Interest Receivable end amount\n- 'initial value2': Accumulated Depreciation initial amount\n- 'end valu2': Accumulated Depreciation end amount\n- 'initial value3': Taxes Payable initial amount\n- 'end valu3': Taxes Payable end amount\n- 'initial value4': Paid-in Capital initial amount\n- 'end valu4': Paid-in Capital end amount\n\nFilling in the values:\n- 'initial value1': '0.00'\n- 'end valu1': '13279.60'\n- 'initial value2': '0.00'\n- 'end valu2': '91505.05'\n- 'initial value3': '0.00'\n- 'end valu3': '243988.48'\n- 'initial value4': '13000000.00'\n- 'end valu4': '13000000.00'\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '0.00', 'end valu1': '13279.60', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '91505.05', 'initial value3': '0.00', 'end valu3': '243988.48', 'initial value4': '13000000.00', 'end valu4': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
