                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line items and values of total assets that are not expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle. These are typically the non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets, long-term investments, and intangible assets, among others.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We need to find the line items that represent non-current assets. These are assets that are not expected to be converted into cash or used up within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually one year).\n\n2. **Identify Non-Current Assets in the Balance Sheet**: \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Total Non-current Assets\" are the ones we are interested in. These include \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation\".\n   - The \"Total Non-current Assets\" line provides the aggregated value of these assets.\n\n3. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The initial amount for \"Total Non-current Assets\" is `5000000.00` as of the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n   - **End Value**: The end amount for \"Total Non-current Assets\" is `4908494.95` as of the end date `2024-02-05`.\n\n4. **Verify**: \n   - The \"Fixed Assets\" line shows an initial amount of `5000000.00` and an end amount of `5000000.00`.\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line shows an initial amount of `0.00` and an end amount of `91505.05`.\n   - The \"Total Non-current Assets\" is calculated as `Fixed Assets` minus `Accumulated Depreciation`, which for the end value is `5000000.00 - 91505.05 = 4908494.95`. This matches the given \"Total Non-current Assets\" end value.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '4908494.95'}}\n```",
