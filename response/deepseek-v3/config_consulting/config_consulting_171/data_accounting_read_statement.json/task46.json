                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nFirst, let's look at the task description:\n\n> Based on the cash flow statement, identify and extract the specific line items and value of net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends, along with the relevant financial data involved in the calculation. In addition, decompose this item into 1 component sub-items, all of which must also originate from the input statement. For each sub-item, output its final value.\n\nOkay, that's a mouthful. Let's simplify it.\n\nWe're dealing with the **cash flow statement**, specifically the **investing activities** section. The task is to:\n\n1. Identify the **net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from investing activities**. This typically includes things like buying or selling long-term assets (like property, plant, equipment), investments not considered cash equivalents, and receiving interest or dividends.\n   \n2. Then, we need to break this net amount down into **one sub-item** that contributes to it. This sub-item must come from the same cash flow statement.\n\nFrom the example provided, it seems that the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is the main value, and its sub-item is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nNow, let's look at the problem we need to solve:\n\n```plaintext\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit  | 1903401.82 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation  | 91505.05 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -2984071.72 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -13279.60 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -485000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 381000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 243988.48 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -862455.97 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Ending Balance  | 7137544.03 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Increase  | -862455.97 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\n\nFrom this, the relevant part for investing activities is:\n\n```plaintext\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\n\n### Identifying the Main Value\n\nThe main value we're interested in is the **\"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\"**, which is `-0.00` in this case.\n\n### Identifying the Sub-item\n\nThe sub-item that contributes to this net cash flow is the **\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\"**, which is `0.00`.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the example:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-305354.43', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '305354.43'}}}\n```\n\nIn the example:\n- \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" was `-305354.43`.\n- The sub-item was \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with `305354.43`.\n\nNotice that the sub-item's value is positive in the example, even though the net is negative. This makes sense because purchasing assets is a cash outflow (negative effect), but the sub-item is listed as a positive value that's then subtracted to get the net.\n\nIn our current problem:\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is `0.00`, so the net is `-0.00`.\n\n### Constructing the Solution\n\nFollowing the same structure as the example:\n\n- Main value: \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" = `-0.00`\n- Sub-item: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = `0.00`\n\nSo, the solution should be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '0.00'}}}\n```\n\nHowever, looking at the example's sub_items format, it's `'sub_item value': 'value'`. So, we'll keep that structure.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '0.00'}}}\n```\n\nBut wait, in the instruction, the format is slightly different:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '______', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '______'} }\n```\n\nIt seems the sub_items are directly under 'solution' with a key like 'sub_items_sub_item value'. Maybe the example had a typo, and the correct format is as per the instruction.\n\nAdjusting accordingly:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '0.00'}}\n```\n\nThis seems to match the instruction's format better.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the cash flow statement and following the structure provided in the example and instructions, the correct solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '0.00'}}\n```",
