This is typically reflected in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section as \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task is to find the line item that shows the change in accounts receivable, which indicates the decrease (or increase) in amounts owed to the entity for credit sales or services.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is present under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities.\"\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with this line item is \"-2984071.72.\" A negative value here typically indicates an increase in accounts receivable (i.e., more amounts are owed to the entity), but the task is to extract the value as it appears.\n\n### Solution:\nThe value to be extracted is \"-2984071.72.\"\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2984071.72'} }\n```",
