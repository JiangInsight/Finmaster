The line item we are interested in is \"Bank Deposits,\" which represents the funds deposited into a bank. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Line Item**: Look for the \"Bank Deposits\" row in the balance sheet. This is the line item that represents the funds deposited into a bank.\n2. **Extract Initial Value**: The initial amount for \"Bank Deposits\" is given in the \"Initial_amount\" column.\n3. **Extract End Value**: The end amount for \"Bank Deposits\" is given in the \"End_amount\" column.\n\nFrom the given balance sheet:\n- The \"Bank Deposits\" row shows:\n  - Initial_amount: 5000000.00\n  - End_amount: 3079000.00\n\nThus, the initial value is '5000000.00' and the end value is '3079000.00'.\n\nThe solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '3079000.00'} }\n```",
