This line item is typically called \"Retained Earnings.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Line Item**: Look for the account named \"Retained Earnings\" in the balance sheet. This account shows the cumulative profits or losses retained in the business.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**: The initial value of \"Retained Earnings\" is given in the \"Initial_amount\" column. In the provided problem, the initial value is \"0.00\" as of the \"Initial_date\" (2023-12-31).\n\n3. **Extract End Value**: The end value of \"Retained Earnings\" is given in the \"End_amount\" column. In the provided problem, the end value is \"1903401.82\" as of the \"End_date\" (2024-02-05).\n\n4. **Verify**: Ensure that the values are correctly extracted from the \"Retained Earnings\" row and not from any other line item.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1903401.82'} }\n```",
