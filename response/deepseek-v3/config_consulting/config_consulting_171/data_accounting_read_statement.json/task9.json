This information is typically found under \"Taxes Payable\" in the liabilities section of the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - Look for the account labeled \"Taxes Payable\" in the balance sheet. This line item represents taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid.\n\n2. **Extract the Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value is the amount under \"Initial_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\". In the given problem, this value is \"0.00\" as of the \"Initial_date\" \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract the End Value**:\n   - The end value is the amount under \"End_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\". In the given problem, this value is \"243988.48\" as of the \"End_date\" \"2024-02-05\".\n\n4. **Construct the Solution**:\n   - The solution should be presented in the specified JSON format with the initial and end values for \"Taxes Payable\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '243988.48'} }\n```",
