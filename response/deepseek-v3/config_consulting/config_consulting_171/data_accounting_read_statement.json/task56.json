This refers to the depreciation expense recorded in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understanding Depreciation**: Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. It is recorded as an expense in the income statement and also appears in the cash flow statement under operating activities.\n2. **Locating Depreciation in the Financial Statements**:\n   - **Income Statement**: The \"Depreciation\" line item is explicitly listed under expenses.\n   - **Cash Flow Statement**: The \"Depreciation\" line item is also listed under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" as it is a non-cash expense added back to net profit.\n   - **Balance Sheet**: The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item shows the total depreciation accumulated over time, but we are interested in the depreciation expense for the period.\n3. **Extracting the Value**:\n   - From the **Income Statement**: The \"Depreciation\" line item shows a value of `91505.05`.\n   - From the **Cash Flow Statement**: The \"Depreciation\" line item also shows a value of `91505.05`.\n   - The value is consistent across both statements, confirming its accuracy.\n\n### Solution:\nThe depreciation expense for the period is `91505.05`.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91505.05'}}\n```",
