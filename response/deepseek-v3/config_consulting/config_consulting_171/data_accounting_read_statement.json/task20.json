COGS reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, including the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the goods.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the given income statement, we look for the line item labeled \"Cost of Goods Sold.\" \n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is the amount we need to extract. \n\n4. **Verify the Line Item**: Ensure that \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is indeed the correct line item representing the carrying amount of inventories sold. This is confirmed by accounting standards and common financial reporting practices.\n\n5. **Check for Other Possibilities**: Sometimes, the line item might be labeled differently (e.g., \"Cost of Sales\"), but in this case, it is clearly labeled as \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\n6. **Finalize the Answer**: The value for \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the given problem is `2018000.00`.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2018000.00'}}\n```",
