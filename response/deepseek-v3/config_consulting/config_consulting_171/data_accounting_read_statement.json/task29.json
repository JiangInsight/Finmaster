Additionally, we need to decompose this item into 1 component sub-item, all of which must also originate from the input statement. \n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Total Income from Ordinary Activities**: \n   - The total income from ordinary activities is typically represented by \"Total Revenue\" in the income statement. \n   - In the given problem, \"Total Revenue\" is listed with an amount of \"4879769.51\".\n\n2. **Identify Constituent Line Items**:\n   - The constituent line item that makes up the \"Total Revenue\" is \"Main Business Revenue\", which is also listed with the same amount of \"4879769.51\". This indicates that \"Main Business Revenue\" is the sole component of \"Total Revenue\" in this case.\n\n3. **Decompose into Sub-Items**:\n   - The task requires decomposing the total income into 1 component sub-item. Here, \"Main Business Revenue\" is the only sub-item under \"Total Revenue\", and its value is the same as \"Total Revenue\".\n\n4. **Extract Values**:\n   - The value of \"Total Revenue\" is \"4879769.51\".\n   - The value of the sub-item (\"Main Business Revenue\") is also \"4879769.51\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '4879769.51', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '4879769.51'} }\n```",
