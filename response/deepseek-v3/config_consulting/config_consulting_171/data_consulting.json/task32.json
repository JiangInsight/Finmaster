                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested metrics one by one using the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nFree Cash Flow is typically calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} - \\text{Capital Expenditures} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -862,455.97\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (Capital Expenditures): 0.00 (since it's listed as 0.00 under investing activities)\n\nSo,\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = -862,455.97 - 0 = -862,455.97 \\]\n\nBut looking at the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents, it's also -862,455.97, which matches our calculation.\n\n### 2. Return on Assets (ROA)\nROA is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\nWhere Average Total Assets is \\((\\text{Beginning Total Assets} + \\text{Ending Total Assets}) / 2\\).\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Total Assets: 13,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets: 15,528,390.30\n- Net Profit: 1,903,401.82\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{13,000,000 + 15,528,390.30}{2} = \\frac{28,528,390.30}{2} = 14,264,195.15 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\frac{1,903,401.82}{14,264,195.15} \\approx 0.1334 \\text{ or } 13.34\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Return on Equity (ROE)\nROE is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Owner's Equity}} \\]\nWhere Average Owner's Equity is \\((\\text{Beginning Owner's Equity} + \\text{Ending Owner's Equity}) / 2\\).\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Owner's Equity: 13,000,000.00\n- Ending Owner's Equity: 14,903,401.82\n- Net Profit: 1,903,401.82\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Owner's Equity} = \\frac{13,000,000 + 14,903,401.82}{2} = \\frac{27,903,401.82}{2} = 13,951,700.91 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{1,903,401.82}{13,951,700.91} \\approx 0.1364 \\text{ or } 13.64\\% \\]\n\n### 4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\nThis is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -862,455.97\n- Net Profit: 1,903,401.82\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-862,455.97}{1,903,401.82} \\approx -0.453 \\]\n\nThis negative ratio suggests that the operating cash flow is negative while net income is positive, which might indicate issues like high increases in working capital (e.g., accounts receivable, inventory).\n\n### 5. Net Profit Margin\nThis is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit: 1,903,401.82\n- Total Revenue: 4,879,769.51\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{1,903,401.82}{4,879,769.51} \\approx 0.3901 \\text{ or } 39.01\\% \\]\n\n### 6. Gross Profit Margin\nThis is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit: 2,861,769.51\n- Total Revenue: 4,879,769.51\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{2,861,769.51}{4,879,769.51} \\approx 0.5865 \\text{ or } 58.65\\% \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, compiling all these calculations into the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-862455.97', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '13.34%', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '13.64%', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.45', 'Net Profit Margin': '39.01%', 'Gross Profit Margin': '58.65%'} }\n```\n\n**Note on Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:**\nThe ratio is negative (-0.45), which might seem unusual but is possible if the company has positive net income but negative operating cash flow due to significant increases in working capital (like large increases in accounts receivable or inventory). This is evident from the cash flow statement where increases in accounts receivable and inventory are substantial, leading to negative operating cash flow despite positive net income. \n\nIf you'd prefer to represent the negative ratio as a positive with a note, you could present it as '0.45 (negative)', but in the JSON, it's correctly represented as '-0.45'. \n\nAlternatively, if the expectation is to take the absolute value, it would be '0.45', but given the standard calculation, '-0.45' is accurate. \n\nGiven the example provided where the ratio was positive (4.41) despite negative net income and negative operating cash flow, it seems the ratio was calculated as absolute value of operating cash flow divided by absolute value of net income. If we follow that approach:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{|-862455.97|}{|1903401.82|} = \\frac{862455.97}{1903401.82} \\approx 0.453 \\]\n\nSo, if following the example's method, it would be '0.45'. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, both interpretations are possible, but the more standard approach is to keep the sign, making it '-0.45'. However, since the example showed a positive ratio despite both numbers being negative, it's likely they took absolute values. \n\n**Adjusted Final Answer (following example's method):**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-862455.97', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '13.34%', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '13.64%', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '0.45', 'Net Profit Margin': '39.01%', 'Gross Profit Margin': '58.65%'} }\n```\n\nThis adjustment aligns with the method used in the provided example where the ratio was positive despite both operating cash flow and net income being negative. Therefore, taking absolute values seems to be the intended approach.",
