                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 10,619,895.35\n- Total Current Liabilities = 624,988.48\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 10,619,895.35 / 624,988.48 ≈ 16.99\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 4,058,544.03\n- Bank Deposits = 3,079,000.00\n- Interest Receivable = 13,279.60\n- Accounts Receivable = 2,984,071.72\n- Current Liabilities = 624,988.48\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 4,058,544.03 + 3,079,000.00 + 13,279.60 + 2,984,071.72 ≈ 10,134,895.35\n\nQuick Ratio = 10,134,895.35 / 624,988.48 ≈ 16.22\n\n*Wait a minute*, usually \"Quick Assets\" exclude Interest Receivable as it's not as liquid as cash or accounts receivable. Maybe I should exclude Interest Receivable.\n\nRevised Quick Assets:\n= Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable\n= 4,058,544.03 + 3,079,000.00 + 2,984,071.72 ≈ 10,121,615.75\n\nQuick Ratio = 10,121,615.75 / 624,988.48 ≈ 16.19\n\n*But looking back at the example solution, they included Interest Receivable in Quick Assets. Maybe it's considered liquid here. I'll stick with the first calculation including Interest Receivable for consistency with the example.*\n\nQuick Ratio ≈ 16.22\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 624,988.48\n- Total Assets = 15,528,390.30\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 624,988.48 / 15,528,390.30 ≈ 0.04\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 624,988.48\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,903,401.82\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 624,988.48 / 14,903,401.82 ≈ 0.04\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -862,455.97\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 624,988.48\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -862,455.97 / 624,988.48 ≈ -1.38\n\n*This seems quite negative, but the operating cash flow is indeed negative in this case.*\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '16.99', 'Quick Ratio': '16.22', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.04', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.38'} }\n```\n\n### Verification:\nLet me double-check the calculations quickly:\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: 10,619,895.35 / 624,988.48 ≈ 16.99 ✔\n2. **Quick Ratio**: (4,058,544.03 + 3,079,000.00 + 2,984,071.72 + 13,279.60) / 624,988.48 ≈ 10,134,895.35 / 624,988.48 ≈ 16.22 ✔\n   - If excluding Interest Receivable: ≈ 16.19 (close enough)\n3. **Debt to Asset**: 624,988.48 / 15,528,390.30 ≈ 0.04 ✔\n4. **Debt to Equity**: 624,988.48 / 14,903,401.82 ≈ 0.04 ✔\n5. **Cash Flow to Debt**: -862,455.97 / 624,988.48 ≈ -1.38 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The company has a very high current and quick ratio, indicating strong liquidity, and very low debt ratios, meaning it's not heavily leveraged. However, the negative cash flow to debt ratio suggests that operating activities are not generating cash to cover debts currently, which might be a concern if this trend continues.",
