                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate two ratios: the Debt to Asset Ratio and the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities listed) = 624,988.48\n- Total Assets = 15,528,390.30\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{624,988.48}{15,528,390.30} \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\n\\[ \\frac{624,988.48}{15,528,390.30} \\approx 0.0402 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.04 when calculated directly. However, looking at the example provided, the ratio was presented with two decimal places, so we'll format it similarly.\n\n**Possible Consideration:**\nWait a minute, in the example, the Debt to Asset Ratio was 0.14, and their Total Current Liabilities were 1,861,550.92 with Total Assets of 13,216,409.49. Calculating that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,861,550.92}{13,216,409.49} \\approx 0.1409 \\] which rounds to 0.14.\n\nSimilarly, here, our calculation gives approximately 0.04. But is there any other debt not listed under current liabilities? The balance sheet shows only current liabilities under liabilities, and the rest is owner's equity. So, it seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any other liabilities. Looking at the balance sheet:\n\n- Accounts Payable: 381,000.00\n- Taxes Payable: 243,988.48\n- Total Current Liabilities: 624,988.48\n- No long-term liabilities are listed.\n\nSo, total liabilities are indeed 624,988.48.\n\nThus, the ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{624,988.48}{15,528,390.30} \\approx 0.0402 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.04\n\nBut the example had a similar structure, and their ratio was higher because their liabilities were higher relative to assets. Maybe in this case, the company has very little debt compared to assets.\n\n**Final Debt to Asset Ratio:** '0.04'\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operating activities to the net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -862,455.97\n- Net Profit (from Income Statement) = 1,903,401.82\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-862,455.97}{1,903,401.82} \\]\n\nThis gives a negative ratio, which is unusual because typically, you'd expect positive cash flow from operations relative to net income. But let's compute it:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-862,455.97}{1,903,401.82} \\approx -0.453 \\]\n\nBut in the example provided, the ratio was positive (4.41), even though both net income and operating cash flow were negative:\n\nExample:\n- Net Profit = -1,645,141.43\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -7,259,994.10\n- Ratio = -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41\n\nSo, negative divided by negative is positive.\n\nIn our case, net profit is positive, and operating cash flow is negative, so the ratio is negative. \n\nBut is this correct? Let me think about what this ratio means. It's showing how much cash is generated from operations relative to net income. A negative ratio here would imply that even though the company has positive net income, its operating cash flow is negative, which could indicate issues like high increases in working capital (like increases in accounts receivable or inventory) eating up cash.\n\nBut is this possible? Yes, looking at the cash flow statement:\n\n- Increase in Accounts Receivable: -2,984,071.72 (this is a cash outflow)\n- Increase in Inventory: -485,000.00 (cash outflow)\nThese are significant outflows despite positive net income.\n\nSo, the negative ratio makes sense in this context.\n\nBut the example had both negative, leading to a positive ratio. Here, one is positive, and the other is negative, leading to a negative ratio.\n\nBut is this the correct interpretation? Maybe the ratio is always presented as an absolute value? Probably not; the sign matters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is supposed to be the absolute value of operating cash flow divided by absolute net income, but that's not standard.\n\nGiven that, and since the example had a positive ratio with both numbers negative, perhaps the ratio is calculated as:\n\n|Operating Cash Flow| / |Net Income|\n\nBut that's not standard. Normally, you divide the two as is, keeping the signs.\n\nGiven that, our ratio is -0.453, but the example was positive. Maybe in the example, they took the absolute values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is Net Income / Operating Cash Flow, but that's the inverse.\n\nLooking at standard definitions, it's Operating Cash Flow / Net Income, so signs matter.\n\nGiven that, our answer is -0.45, but the example was positive with both negative, implying they took absolute values.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll stick with the standard definition: Operating Cash Flow / Net Income, keeping signs.\n\nSo, -862,455.97 / 1,903,401.82 ≈ -0.453\n\nBut the example had:\n\n-7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41\n\nSo, same formula, signs matter.\n\nThus, our answer is -0.45, but since the example had two decimal places, we'll present as -0.45.\n\nBut looking at the numbers more precisely:\n\n-862,455.97 / 1,903,401.82 ≈ -0.4531, so -0.45 when rounded.\n\nBut the example was 4.41, which is to two decimal places, so we'll present similarly.\n\n**Final Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:** '-0.45'\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.45'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me quickly verify the calculations:\n\n1. Debt to Asset Ratio:\n   - Total Liabilities = 624,988.48\n   - Total Assets = 15,528,390.30\n   - 624,988.48 / 15,528,390.30 ≈ 0.0402 → '0.04'\n\n2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:\n   - Operating Cash Flow = -862,455.97\n   - Net Income = 1,903,401.82\n   - -862,455.97 / 1,903,401.82 ≈ -0.453 → '-0.45'\n\nEverything checks out. The negative operating cash flow despite positive net income is due to significant increases in accounts receivable and inventory, which are uses of cash. The low debt to asset ratio indicates the company is not heavily leveraged, with most assets financed by equity.",
