                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'll go through each ratio one by one, explaining how I arrive at the numbers. \n\n### Understanding the Data\nFirst, let's summarize the key figures we'll need from the provided financial statements:\n\n**Balance Sheet (End of Period):**\n- **Current Assets:**\n  - Cash on Hand: 4,058,544.03\n  - Bank Deposits: 3,079,000.00\n  - Interest Receivable: 13,279.60\n  - Accounts Receivable: 2,984,071.72\n  - Inventory: 485,000.00\n  - **Total Current Assets:** 10,619,895.35\n- **Non-current Assets:**\n  - Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00\n  - Accumulated Depreciation: -91,505.05\n  - **Total Non-current Assets:** 4,908,494.95\n  - **Total Assets:** 15,528,390.30\n- **Current Liabilities:**\n  - Accounts Payable: 381,000.00\n  - Taxes Payable: 243,988.48\n  - **Total Current Liabilities:** 624,988.48\n- **Owner's Equity:**\n  - Paid-in Capital: 13,000,000.00\n  - Retained Earnings: 1,903,401.82\n  - **Total Owner's Equity:** 14,903,401.82\n  - **Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity:** 15,528,390.30\n\n**Cash Flow Statement:**\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -862,455.97\n- **Net Profit:** 1,903,401.82\n- **Depreciation:** 91,505.05\n- Changes in working capital items (like receivables, inventory, payables) are also provided but we'll focus on the net operating cash flow for now.\n\n**Income Statement:**\n- **Main Business Revenue (Sales):** 4,879,769.51\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** 2,018,000.00\n- **Gross Profit:** 2,861,769.51\n- Various expenses leading to **Net Profit:** 1,903,401.82\n\n### Calculating the Ratios\n\n1. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**\n   - **Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n   - **Operating Cash Flow:** -862,455.97 (from cash flow statement)\n   - **Current Liabilities:** 624,988.48\n   - **Calculation:** -862,455.97 / 624,988.48 ≈ -1.38\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**\n   - **Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n   - **Total Debt:** In this case, it seems the company doesn't have long-term debt listed, only current liabilities. Assuming total debt is just current liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are mentioned), so 624,988.48\n   - **Operating Cash Flow:** -862,455.97\n   - **Calculation:** -862,455.97 / 624,988.48 ≈ -1.38\n   - *Note:* If there's no long-term debt, this ratio is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. If long-term debt is zero, then total debt is just current liabilities.\n\n3. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**\n   - **Formula:** Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n   - **COGS:** 2,018,000.00\n   - **Average Inventory:** Since initial inventory is 0 and ending is 485,000, average is (0 + 485,000)/2 = 242,500\n   - **Calculation:** 2,018,000 / 242,500 ≈ 8.32\n   - *Alternative:* Sometimes only ending inventory is used if beginning is zero or not meaningful. Using ending inventory: 2,018,000 / 485,000 ≈ 4.16\n   - *Given the example had a similar situation and used a higher number, likely using average inventory is correct, so 8.32.*\n\n4. **Debt to Equity Ratio**\n   - **Formula:** Total Debt / Total Equity\n   - **Total Debt:** Current liabilities (assuming no long-term debt): 624,988.48\n   - **Total Equity:** 14,903,401.82\n   - **Calculation:** 624,988.48 / 14,903,401.82 ≈ 0.042 or 0.04\n   - *But the example had a higher ratio, maybe including something else as debt. If we consider all liabilities (only current here), same as above. Maybe the example included something else. Given that, sticking with 0.04.*\n\n5. **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)**\n   - **Formula:** (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n   - **Current Assets:** 10,619,895.35\n   - **Inventory:** 485,000.00\n   - **Current Liabilities:** 624,988.48\n   - **Calculation:** (10,619,895.35 - 485,000) / 624,988.48 = 10,134,895.35 / 624,988.48 ≈ 16.22\n   - *This seems very high. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, quick assets are cash + marketable securities + receivables. Here: cash on hand + bank deposits + interest receivable + accounts receivable = 4,058,544.03 + 3,079,000 + 13,279.60 + 2,984,071.72 = 10,134,895.35 (same as above). So same result. Maybe the inventory is not being subtracted correctly? But according to formula, it is. Maybe the example had a different interpretation. Given that, sticking with 16.22.*\n\n6. **Current Ratio**\n   - **Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n   - **Current Assets:** 10,619,895.35\n   - **Current Liabilities:** 624,988.48\n   - **Calculation:** 10,619,895.35 / 624,988.48 ≈ 17.00\n\n*Reviewing the example provided, their ratios were much lower, especially quick and current ratios. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the current liabilities. Here, total current liabilities are clearly 624,988.48, and current assets are much higher, leading to high ratios. Unless there's unlisted debt, these seem correct.*\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter carefully calculating each ratio, here's the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.38', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.38', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '8.32', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.04', 'Quick Ratio': '16.22', 'Current Ratio': '17.00'}}\n```\n\n*Note: The high quick and current ratios suggest the company has a very large amount of current assets relative to its current liabilities, which may indicate strong liquidity. The negative operating cash flow and cash flow to debt ratios indicate that the company's operating activities are not generating positive cash flow relative to its obligations, which could be a concern if sustained.*",
