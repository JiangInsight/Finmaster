In this case, it is `-862,455.97`.\n\n2. **Identify the Current Liabilities:** This is the \"Total Current Liabilities\" from the balance sheet. In this case, it is `624,988.48`.\n\n3. **Calculate the Ratio:** The formula for the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the numbers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{-862,455.97}{624,988.48} \\approx -1.38\n   \\]\n\n4. **Present the Answer:** The ratio is rounded to two decimal places.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.38'} }\n```",
