                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step to ensure I understand how each is derived from the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all Main Business Revenue is credit sales) = 4,879,769.51\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable (2023-12-31) = 0.00\n- End Accounts Receivable (2024-02-05) = 2,984,071.72\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Initial + End) / 2 = (0 + 2,984,071.72) / 2 = 1,492,035.86\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\frac{4,879,769.51}{1,492,035.86} \\approx 3.27 \\]\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -862,455.97\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 624,988.48\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\frac{-862,455.97}{624,988.48} \\approx -1.38 \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis is essentially the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio in this context, as both use Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities and Current Liabilities.\n\nSo, same as above:\n\\[ -1.38 \\]\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Sales}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Sales (Total Revenue) = 4,879,769.51\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Assets (2023-12-31) = 13,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets (2024-02-05) = 15,528,390.30\n- Average Total Assets = (Initial + End) / 2 = (13,000,000 + 15,528,390.30) / 2 = 14,264,195.15\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\frac{4,879,769.51}{14,264,195.15} \\approx 0.34 \\]\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no non-current liabilities are listed) = 624,988.48\n- Total Shareholders' Equity = 14,903,401.82\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\frac{624,988.48}{14,903,401.82} \\approx 0.042 \\]\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the Debt to Equity Ratio was calculated as Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity, which in this case is the same as above. But the example had a higher ratio, so perhaps I missed something. \n\nWait, in the given problem, Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity sum to Total Assets, and Total Liabilities is just the current liabilities since non-current liabilities aren't listed. So it seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the example's calculation to see if I'm missing something.\n\nIn the example:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,861,550.92\n- Total Owner's Equity = 11,354,858.57\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.16\n\nSimilarly, in our problem:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 624,988.48\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,903,401.82\n- Ratio = 624,988.48 / 14,903,401.82 ≈ 0.042\n\nBut the example's ratio was higher, maybe because they included more liabilities. Here, we only have current liabilities, so the ratio is lower.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is Total Debt / Equity, but if all liabilities are considered debt, then it's the same. Maybe the example had more liabilities.\n\nGiven that, I think my calculation is correct based on the data provided.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.27', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-1.38', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.38', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.34', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.04'}}\n```\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the example, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio were the same, which matches our case. \n\nAlso, the Debt to Equity Ratio in the example was 0.16, and here it's much lower because our current liabilities are smaller relative to equity.\n\nEverything checks out. \n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.27', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-1.38', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.38', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.34', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.04'}}\n```",
