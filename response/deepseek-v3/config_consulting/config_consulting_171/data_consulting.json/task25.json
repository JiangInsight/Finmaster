                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each of the three required ratios: Debt to Equity Ratio, Net Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio. \n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the financial leverage of a company by comparing its total liabilities to its shareholders' equity. \n\n**Formula:** \n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 624,988.48\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 624,988.48\n- **Total Owner's Equity (End_amount):** 14,903,401.82\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{624,988.48}{14,903,401.82} \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{624,988.48}{14,903,401.82} \\approx 0.04194 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[ \\approx 0.04 \\]\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the ratio was given to two decimal places, so we'll keep it as '0.04'.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. \n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** 1,903,401.82\n- **Total Revenue:** 4,879,769.51\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,903,401.82}{4,879,769.51} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nLet's compute the division first:\n\\[ \\frac{1,903,401.82}{4,879,769.51} \\approx 0.3901 \\]\n\nNow multiply by 100%:\n\\[ 0.3901 \\times 100\\% \\approx 39.01\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -862,455.97\n- From the balance sheet:\n  - **Total Current Liabilities:** 624,988.48\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-862,455.97}{624,988.48} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ \\frac{-862,455.97}{624,988.48} \\approx -1.38 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[ \\approx -1.38 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.04', 'Net Profit Margin': '39.01%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.38'}}\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - Liabilities: 624,988.48\n   - Equity: 14,903,401.82\n   - 624,988.48 / 14,903,401.82 ≈ 0.04 ✔\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - Net Profit: 1,903,401.82\n   - Revenue: 4,879,769.51\n   - (1,903,401.82 / 4,879,769.51) * 100 ≈ 39.01% ✔\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -862,455.97\n   - Current Liabilities: 624,988.48\n   - -862,455.97 / 624,988.48 ≈ -1.38 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The ratios are calculated correctly based on the provided financial statements.",
