This should match the FCF calculation, as the net increase in cash is the result of operating and investing activities (assuming no financing activities are involved in this simplified example).\n\nThus, the Free Cash Flow (FCF) is -862,455.97.\n\nThe solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-862455.97'} }\n```",
