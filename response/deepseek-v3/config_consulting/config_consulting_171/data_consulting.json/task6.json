                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Net Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Net Profit Margin\nFirst, I need to recall what the Net Profit Margin is. From what I remember, the Net Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows what percentage of a company's revenue is actual profit after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted. \n\nThe formula for Net Profit Margin is:\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nThis will give us a percentage that indicates how much out of every dollar of revenue is actual profit.\n\n### Identifying the Given Values\nLooking at the provided income statement:\n\n- **Total Revenue**: 4,879,769.51\n- **Net Profit**: 1,903,401.82\n\nThese are the two key numbers we need for our calculation.\n\n### Calculating the Net Profit Margin\nNow, let's plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,903,401.82}{4,879,769.51} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide Net Profit by Total Revenue:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,903,401.82}{4,879,769.51} \\approx 0.390 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.390 \\times 100 = 39.0\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nLet me double-check the division to ensure accuracy:\n\n1,903,401.82 ÷ 4,879,769.51:\n\nCalculating this:\n\n- 4,879,769.51 × 0.3 = 1,463,930.853\n- Subtract from numerator: 1,903,401.82 - 1,463,930.853 ≈ 439,470.967\n- Now, 4,879,769.51 × 0.09 ≈ 439,179.2559\n- Adding up: 0.3 + 0.09 = 0.39\n\nSo, the division is approximately 0.39, which is correct.\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\nTherefore, the Net Profit Margin is 39.0%.\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the percentage was given to two decimal places. Maybe we should be more precise.\n\nLet's do a more precise calculation:\n\n1,903,401.82 ÷ 4,879,769.51 ≈ 0.390056 (using a calculator)\n\nThen, 0.390056 × 100 ≈ 39.0056%\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 39.01%\n\nBut the example had it as '-30.29%', which is two decimal places. So, maybe we should present it similarly.\n\nGiven that, let's say 39.01%.\n\nBut is 0.390056 closer to 39.01% or 39.00%? \n\n0.390056 × 100 = 39.0056%, which is closer to 39.01% than to 39.00%.\n\nBut 39.0056% is essentially 39.01% when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was just showing two decimal places without rounding, but since our calculation is exactly 0.39, it's 39.00%.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n1,903,401.82 / 4,879,769.51 = ?\n\nCalculating more precisely:\n\n1,903,401.82 ÷ 4,879,769.51 ≈ 0.390056\n\nSo, 0.390056 × 100 = 39.0056%\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 39.01%\n\nBut is the exact division exactly 0.39? \n\nLet me check:\n\n4,879,769.51 × 0.39 = ?\n\n0.39 × 4,879,769.51 = ?\n\nCalculating:\n\n4,879,769.51 × 0.39:\n\n4,879,769.51 × 0.3 = 1,463,930.853\n\n4,879,769.51 × 0.09 = 439,179.2559\n\nAdding: 1,463,930.853 + 439,179.2559 ≈ 1,903,110.1089\n\nBut Net Profit is 1,903,401.82, so the difference is:\n\n1,903,401.82 - 1,903,110.1089 ≈ 291.7111\n\nSo, 0.39 is slightly less. \n\nTo get the exact, we'd need to add a small amount.\n\nBut for practical purposes, 0.390056 is close enough to 0.3901 when considering four decimal places, leading to 39.01%.\n\nBut given that the multiplication of 0.39 gives us very close to the net profit, maybe it's exactly 0.39.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are such that it's exactly 0.39.\n\nGiven that, and since the example had two decimal places, and our calculation is exactly 0.39, we can present it as 39.00%.\n\nBut to be precise, since the exact division is slightly more than 0.39, it's 39.01%.\n\nGiven that, and to match the example's precision, let's go with 39.01%.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter carefully calculating and verifying, the Net Profit Margin is approximately 39.01%.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '39.01%'} }\n```",
