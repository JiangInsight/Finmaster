                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three ratios: the Debt to Asset Ratio, the Gross Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. I'll go through each one, explaining how to compute them using the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 624,988.48\n- **Total Non-current Liabilities:** Not provided explicitly, but looking at the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are under \"Total Current Liabilities.\" There's no mention of long-term debt or other non-current liabilities. So, we'll assume Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 624,988.48.\n  \n- **Total Assets (End_amount):** 15,528,390.30\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{624,988.48}{15,528,390.30} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n624,988.48 ÷ 15,528,390.30 ≈ 0.04024\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 0.040 or 4.0%. But looking at the example, it's presented as a decimal, not a percentage. So, we'll keep it as 0.04.\n\nWait, let's check if there are any other liabilities. The balance sheet shows \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" equals \"Total Assets,\" which is correct. The components are \"Total Current Liabilities\" and \"Total Owner's Equity.\" So, indeed, Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 624,988.48.\n\nThus, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.04.\n\nBut in the example, it was 0.14, which is higher. Maybe I missed something. Let me check the balance sheet again.\n\nWait, is there any other liability? The balance sheet has:\n- Accounts Payable: 381,000.00\n- Taxes Payable: 243,988.48\n- Total Current Liabilities: 624,988.48\n- Then Paid-in Capital and Retained Earnings under Owner's Equity.\n\nNo long-term debt or other liabilities. So, it seems correct at 0.04.\n\nBut the example had a higher ratio, maybe because they had more liabilities. Here, liabilities are relatively small compared to assets.\n\nSo, I'll stick with 0.04.\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 2,861,769.51\n- **Total Revenue:** 4,879,769.51\n\nCalculate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,861,769.51}{4,879,769.51} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide:\n\n2,861,769.51 ÷ 4,879,769.51 ≈ 0.5864\n\nThen multiply by 100:\n\n0.5864 × 100 ≈ 58.64%\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately 58.64%.\n\nIn the example, it was 18.80%, which is much lower. Here, the gross profit is a larger portion of revenue, which is good.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow from its operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -862,455.97 (negative value)\n  \nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 624,988.48\n\nCalculate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-862,455.97}{624,988.48} \\]\n\nDivide:\n\n-862,455.97 ÷ 624,988.48 ≈ -1.38\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately -1.38.\n\nIn the example, it was -3.90, also negative, indicating that operating cash flow isn't covering current liabilities, which is a concern.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios:\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.04\n- Gross Profit Margin: 58.64%\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -1.38\n\nBut looking at the example's format, the Gross Profit Margin was given with two decimal places (18.80%), and the others were also with two decimal places. So, let's format similarly:\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.04 (already two decimal places)\n- Gross Profit Margin: 58.64% (rounded to two decimal places)\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -1.38 (already two decimal places)\n\nHowever, in the example, the Debt to Asset Ratio was '0.14', which is one decimal place, but it's possible it was rounded from more precise. Here, 0.04024 could be rounded to 0.04 or 0.040. I'll go with two decimal places for consistency.\n\nSimilarly, Operating Cash Flow Ratio in example was -3.90, which is two decimal places, so -1.38 is fine.\n\nGross Profit Margin is 58.64%.\n\nSo, the final JSON is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04', 'Gross Profit Margin': '58.64%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.38'}}\n```\n\nBut let me double-check the Debt to Asset Ratio calculation because 0.04 seems quite low compared to the example's 0.14. Maybe I missed some liabilities.\n\nLooking back at the balance sheet, under liabilities, only current liabilities are listed: Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable, summing to Total Current Liabilities. There's no long-term debt or other liabilities. So, total liabilities are indeed 624,988.48, and total assets are 15,528,390.30, giving 624,988.48 / 15,528,390.30 ≈ 0.04.\n\nPerhaps the company in this problem has very little debt compared to assets, hence the low ratio. That's plausible.\n\nSimilarly, Gross Profit Margin is correctly calculated as Gross Profit / Total Revenue = 2,861,769.51 / 4,879,769.51 ≈ 58.64%.\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio is Net Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities = -862,455.97 / 624,988.48 ≈ -1.38.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04', 'Gross Profit Margin': '58.64%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.38'}}\n```",
