These typically include:\n   - Cash on Hand\n   - Bank Deposits\n   - Interest Receivable\n   - Accounts Receivable\n   - (Note: Inventory is not included in quick assets because it is not as liquid.)\n\n2. **Identify Current Liabilities**: These are liabilities that are due within one year. In this case, it is the \"Total Current Liabilities.\"\n\n3. **Calculate Quick Ratio**: The formula for the Quick Ratio is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Quick Assets**:\n   - Cash on Hand: 4,058,544.03\n   - Bank Deposits: 3,079,000.00\n   - Interest Receivable: 13,279.60\n   - Accounts Receivable: 2,984,071.72\n   - Total Quick Assets = 4,058,544.03 + 3,079,000.00 + 13,279.60 + 2,984,071.72 = 10,134,895.35\n\n2. **Current Liabilities**:\n   - Total Current Liabilities: 624,988.48\n\n3. **Quick Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{10,134,895.35}{624,988.48} \\approx 16.22\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '16.22'} }\n```",
