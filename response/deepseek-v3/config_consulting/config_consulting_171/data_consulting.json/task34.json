                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through them step by step, explaining how I calculate each one based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -862,455.97\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end period):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 624,988.48\n\nCalculation:\n= -862,455.97 / 624,988.48 ≈ -1.38\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 624,988.48 (this is the only liability listed, so total debt is this)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,903,401.82\n\nCalculation:\n= 624,988.48 / 14,903,401.82 ≈ 0.04\n\nWait a minute, in the example, \"Debt to Equity Ratio\" was calculated using Total Current Liabilities as the numerator. But traditionally, Debt to Equity includes all liabilities (both current and non-current). Here, only current liabilities are given, and no long-term debt is listed. So, assuming total debt is just current liabilities:\n\n= 624,988.48 / 14,903,401.82 ≈ 0.04\n\nBut the example had a similar situation and got 0.16, which suggests maybe they're using a different approach. Maybe they're including other liabilities not listed here? But in our case, only current liabilities are present, so it's 0.04.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" is 15,528,390.30, and Owner's Equity is 14,903,401.82, then Total Liabilities = Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity - Owner's Equity = 15,528,390.30 - 14,903,401.82 = 624,988.48, which matches current liabilities. So, same result.\n\nPerhaps the example had more liabilities. Here, it's 0.04.\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 4,879,769.51\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets = 15,528,390.30\n- Average Total Assets = (Initial + End) / 2 = (13,000,000 + 15,528,390.30) / 2 = 14,264,195.15\n\nCalculation:\n= 4,879,769.51 / 14,264,195.15 ≈ 0.34\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end period):\n- Total Current Assets = 10,619,895.35\n- Inventory = 485,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 624,988.48\n\nCalculation:\n= (10,619,895.35 - 485,000) / 624,988.48 = 10,134,895.35 / 624,988.48 ≈ 16.22\n\nWait, that seems too high. Let me check the components:\nQuick Assets = Cash + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 4,058,544.03 (Cash on Hand) + 3,079,000.00 (Bank Deposits) + 13,279.60 (Interest Receivable) + 2,984,071.72 (Accounts Receivable) = 4,058,544.03 + 3,079,000 = 7,137,544.03 + 13,279.60 = 7,150,823.63 + 2,984,071.72 = 10,134,895.35\n\nCurrent Liabilities = 624,988.48\n\nQuick Ratio = 10,134,895.35 / 624,988.48 ≈ 16.22\n\nThis seems correct based on the numbers, but it's unusually high. Maybe the inventory is not part of current assets here? But Total Current Assets is given as 10,619,895.35, and the sum of the individual current assets is:\n\nCash on Hand: 4,058,544.03  \nBank Deposits: 3,079,000.00  \nInterest Receivable: 13,279.60  \nAccounts Receivable: 2,984,071.72  \nInventory: 485,000.00  \nTotal: 4,058,544.03 + 3,079,000 = 7,137,544.03 + 13,279.60 = 7,150,823.63 + 2,984,071.72 = 10,134,895.35 + 485,000 = 10,619,895.35 (matches)\n\nSo, Quick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 10,619,895.35 - 485,000 = 10,134,895.35\n\nQuick Ratio = 10,134,895.35 / 624,988.48 ≈ 16.22\n\nThis seems correct based on the data, but it's unusually high, suggesting very high liquidity.\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nThis is the same as the first ratio, Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\nFrom earlier:\n= -862,455.97 / 624,988.48 ≈ -1.38\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Income / Average Shareholder's Equity\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = 1,903,401.82\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Owner's Equity = 13,000,000.00\n- End Owner's Equity = 14,903,401.82\n- Average Equity = (Initial + End) / 2 = (13,000,000 + 14,903,401.82) / 2 = 13,951,700.91\n\nCalculation:\n= 1,903,401.82 / 13,951,700.91 ≈ 0.1364 or 13.64%\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since no info on cash sales):\nFrom income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 4,879,769.51\n\nFrom balance sheet:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00\n- End Accounts Receivable = 2,984,071.72\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Initial + End) / 2 = (0 + 2,984,071.72) / 2 = 1,492,035.86\n\nCalculation:\n= 4,879,769.51 / 1,492,035.86 ≈ 3.27\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.38', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.04', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.34', 'Quick Ratio': '16.22', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.38', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '13.64%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.27'}}\n```\n\n**Reviewing the Quick Ratio:**\nThe Quick Ratio seems unusually high at 16.22. This suggests that the company has a very large amount of liquid assets relative to its current liabilities, which might not be typical. However, based on the given numbers:\n- Quick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable = 4,058,544.03 + 3,079,000 + 13,279.60 + 2,984,071.72 = 10,134,895.35\n- Current Liabilities = 624,988.48\n- Quick Ratio = 10,134,895.35 / 624,988.48 ≈ 16.22\n\nThis seems mathematically correct based on the provided data, so I'll keep it as is unless there's a misinterpretation.\n\n**Alternative Interpretation for Debt to Equity:**\nIf we consider that \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" is 15,528,390.30 and \"Total Owner's Equity\" is 14,903,401.82, then \"Total Liabilities\" = 15,528,390.30 - 14,903,401.82 = 624,988.48, which matches \"Total Current Liabilities\". So, Debt to Equity is indeed 624,988.48 / 14,903,401.82 ≈ 0.04.\n\n**Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:**\nGiven that initial Accounts Receivable is 0, the average is half of the ending amount, leading to a higher turnover ratio. This might indicate that the company started with no receivables and accumulated them during the period, making the average low and the ratio high.\n\nAll other calculations seem correct based on the provided data.",
