                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial task step by step. I'm going to calculate two ratios: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio. I'll use the provided financial statements to find the necessary numbers.\n\n### 1. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:**\nGross Profit Margin is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n- Gross Profit = 2,861,769.51\n- Total Revenue = 4,879,769.51\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,861,769.51}{4,879,769.51} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\\[ \\frac{2,861,769.51}{4,879,769.51} \\approx 0.5864 \\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\\[ 0.5864 \\times 100 \\approx 58.64\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **58.64%**.\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nFirst, let's find the **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities** from the **cash flow statement**:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -862,455.97\n\nNext, we need to find the **Total Debt**. From the **balance sheet**, total debt is typically the sum of all liabilities. Looking at the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 624,988.48\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed (like long-term debt), so Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 624,988.48\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-862,455.97}{624,988.48} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ \\frac{-862,455.97}{624,988.48} \\approx -1.38 \\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-1.38**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining both calculations:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '58.64%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.38'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin:**\n   - Gross Profit / Total Revenue = 2,861,769.51 / 4,879,769.51 ≈ 0.5864 → 58.64% ✔\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:**\n   - Net Operating Cash Flow = -862,455.97\n   - Total Debt = 624,988.48 (only current liabilities present)\n   - Ratio = -862,455.97 / 624,988.48 ≈ -1.38 ✔\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin:** A high gross profit margin like 58.64% indicates that the company retains a significant portion of revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold, which is generally positive.\n  \n- **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:** A negative value here (-1.38) suggests that the company's operating cash flow is negative, meaning it's not generating enough cash from operations to cover its debt obligations. This could be a concern unless it's a temporary situation (e.g., due to heavy investments or seasonal factors).\n\n### Potential Missteps\n\nInitially, I wondered if \"Total Debt\" should include any non-current liabilities, but in the given balance sheet, there are no entries for long-term debt or similar items under liabilities. Only current liabilities are present, so it's correct to use just the total current liabilities as total debt in this case.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the signs (positive/negative) are correctly carried over is crucial, especially for the cash flow to debt ratio where the numerator is negative.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully going through the numbers and verifying each step, the final ratios are correctly calculated as shown above.",
