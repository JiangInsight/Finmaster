There are no non-current liabilities listed, so the total liabilities are 624,988.48.\n\n2. **Identify Total Owner's Equity**: From the balance sheet, the \"Total Owner's Equity\" at the end of the reporting period is 14,903,401.82.\n\n3. **Calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio**: The formula for the Debt to Equity Ratio is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the numbers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{624,988.48}{14,903,401.82} \\approx 0.0419\n   \\]\n   Rounding to two decimal places, the ratio is 0.04.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The Debt to Equity Ratio is 0.04.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.04'} }\n```",
