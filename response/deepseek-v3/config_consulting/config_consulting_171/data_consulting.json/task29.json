                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the four requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities listed):** 624,988.48\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 14,903,401.82\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{624,988.48}{14,903,401.82} \\approx 0.0419 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.04\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** 1,903,401.82\n- **Total Revenue:** 4,879,769.51\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,903,401.82}{4,879,769.51} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 39.01\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nSince we only have the ending total assets (no beginning for the period, but initial is from the previous period), we'll use the ending total assets for simplicity (though ideally, average is better if beginning is available).\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Assets (End):** 15,528,390.30\n- **Net Profit:** 1,903,401.82\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\left( \\frac{1,903,401.82}{15,528,390.30} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 12.26\\% \\]\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company collects receivables. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since we don't have separate data), we'll use Total Revenue for Net Credit Sales. For average accounts receivable, since beginning AR is 0 and ending is 2,984,071.72, the average is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average AR} = \\frac{0 + 2,984,071.72}{2} = 1,492,035.86 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Total Revenue (Net Credit Sales):** 4,879,769.51\n\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{4,879,769.51}{1,492,035.86} \\approx 3.27 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.04', 'Net Profit Margin': '39.01%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '12.26%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.27'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. **Debt to Equity:** 624,988.48 / 14,903,401.82 ≈ 0.04 ✔\n2. **Net Profit Margin:** (1,903,401.82 / 4,879,769.51) * 100 ≈ 39.01% ✔\n3. **ROA:** (1,903,401.82 / 15,528,390.30) * 100 ≈ 12.26% ✔\n4. **AR Turnover:** 4,879,769.51 / 1,492,035.86 ≈ 3.27 ✔\n\nEverything checks out!",
