                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Gross Profit Margin and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods.\n   \n   Formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**: This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It indicates short-term liquidity.\n   \n   Formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the **Income Statement**:\n- Total Revenue: \\$4,879,769.51\n- Cost of Goods Sold: \\$2,018,000.00\n- Gross Profit: \\$2,861,769.51\n\nFrom the **Cash Flow Statement**:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$862,455.97\n\nFrom the **Balance Sheet**:\n- Total Current Liabilities: \\$624,988.48\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,861,769.51}{4,879,769.51} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\\[\n\\frac{2,861,769.51}{4,879,769.51} \\approx 0.5864\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\\[\n0.5864 \\times 100 \\approx 58.64\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **58.64%**.\n\n### Calculating Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-862,455.97}{624,988.48}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{-862,455.97}{624,988.48} \\approx -1.38\n\\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately **-1.38**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit = Total Revenue - COGS = 4,879,769.51 - 2,018,000 = 2,861,769.51\n   - 2,861,769.51 / 4,879,769.51 ≈ 0.5864 → 58.64%\n   - This seems correct.\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is negative: -862,455.97\n   - Total Current Liabilities: 624,988.48\n   - -862,455.97 / 624,988.48 ≈ -1.38\n   - This also seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating both ratios, here's the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '58.64%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.38'}}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Results\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin (58.64%)**: This indicates that for every dollar of revenue, the company retains about 58.64 cents after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This is a healthy margin, suggesting good control over production costs relative to sales.\n  \n- **Operating Cash Flow Ratio (-1.38)**: A negative ratio means that the company's operating activities are not generating enough cash to cover its current liabilities. In fact, it's in a deficit, which could signal liquidity issues unless other sources of cash are available.\n\nThese metrics together suggest that while the company is profitable in terms of gross profit, it's facing challenges in converting that profitability into positive operating cash flow, possibly due to increases in receivables or inventory, as seen in the cash flow statement.",
