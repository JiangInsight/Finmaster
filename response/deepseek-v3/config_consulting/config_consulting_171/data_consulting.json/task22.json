                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate the Quick Ratio and the Net Profit Margin based on the provided financial statements. \n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\n**Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):**\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- **Quick Assets** = Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable\n  - From the balance sheet, these would typically be:\n    - Cash on Hand\n    - Bank Deposits (considered as cash equivalents)\n    - Accounts Receivable\n    - Interest Receivable (usually considered part of accounts receivable or a quick asset)\n  - Inventory is **not** included in quick assets because it's not as liquid.\n\n**Net Profit Margin:**\nThis ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet** (end amounts for 2024-02-05):\n- Cash on Hand: 4,058,544.03\n- Bank Deposits: 3,079,000.00\n- Interest Receivable: 13,279.60\n- Accounts Receivable: 2,984,071.72\n- Inventory: 485,000.00 (not part of quick assets)\n- Total Current Liabilities: 624,988.48\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n- Total Revenue: 4,879,769.51\n- Net Profit: 1,903,401.82\n\n### Calculating Quick Ratio\n\n**Step 1: Identify Quick Assets**\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable\n= 4,058,544.03 + 3,079,000.00 + 2,984,071.72 + 13,279.60\n= 4,058,544.03 + 3,079,000.00 = 7,137,544.03\n+ 2,984,071.72 = 10,121,615.75\n+ 13,279.60 = 10,134,895.35\n\nWait a minute, let's add them step by step to avoid mistakes:\n- 4,058,544.03 (Cash on Hand)\n- + 3,079,000.00 (Bank Deposits) = 7,137,544.03\n- + 2,984,071.72 (Accounts Receivable) = 10,121,615.75\n- + 13,279.60 (Interest Receivable) = 10,134,895.35\n\n**Step 2: Identify Current Liabilities**\nFrom the balance sheet:\nTotal Current Liabilities = 624,988.48\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Quick Ratio**\nQuick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities\n= 10,134,895.35 / 624,988.48\n\nNow, let's do the division:\n10,134,895.35 ÷ 624,988.48 ≈ ?\n\nCalculating this:\n624,988.48 × 16 = 624,988 × 16 = 9,999,808; + 988.48 × 16 ≈ 15,815.68 → ~10,015,623.68\nBut we have 10,134,895.35, so it's more than 16.\n\nLet's try 16.2:\n624,988.48 × 16.2:\n600,000 × 16.2 = 9,720,000\n24,988 × 16.2 ≈ 24,000 × 16.2 = 388,800; + 988 × 16.2 ≈ 16,000\nTotal ≈ 9,720,000 + 388,800 + 16,000 ≈ 10,124,800\nOur quick assets are 10,134,895.35, so slightly more than 16.2.\n\nLet's compute it precisely:\n10,134,895.35 ÷ 624,988.48 ≈ 16.216\n\nSo, Quick Ratio ≈ 16.22\n\nWait, that seems extremely high. Maybe I included too much in quick assets.\n\nLooking back, sometimes \"Bank Deposits\" might not all be immediately liquid, but generally, they are considered cash equivalents. Similarly, \"Interest Receivable\" is usually included.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the current liabilities are very low compared to quick assets, making the ratio high.\n\nBut let's cross-validate with the example provided in the task.\n\nIn the example:\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand (270,005.90) + Bank Deposits (164,645.57) + Accounts Receivable (2,429,482.13) + Interest Receivable (2,672.87) = ?\n270,005.90 + 164,645.57 = 434,651.47\n+ 2,429,482.13 = 2,864,133.60\n+ 2,672.87 = 2,866,806.47\nCurrent Liabilities = 1,861,550.92\nQuick Ratio = 2,866,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54\nWhich matches the given solution.\n\nSo my calculation seems correct in method, just the numbers are different here.\n\nSo for our problem:\nQuick Ratio = 10,134,895.35 / 624,988.48 ≈ 16.22\n\nBut this seems unusually high. Maybe the current liabilities are supposed to be higher, but the table shows only Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable summing to 624,988.48.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Bank Deposits\" are not fully quick, but usually they are.\n\nGiven that, I think the Quick Ratio is indeed approximately 16.22, but since the example was rounded to two decimal places, we'll do the same: 16.22\n\nBut looking at the numbers, perhaps \"Bank Deposits\" are not all quick. Maybe only a portion is readily available. But without additional info, we'll assume all are quick.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct quick assets exclude some items. Sometimes \"quick assets\" are defined as Current Assets minus Inventory.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\nTotal Current Assets = 10,619,895.35\nInventory = 485,000.00\nQuick Assets = Total Current Assets - Inventory = 10,619,895.35 - 485,000 = 10,134,895.35\nWhich is the same as what I had earlier.\n\nSo Quick Ratio is indeed 10,134,895.35 / 624,988.48 ≈ 16.22\n\nBut this seems too high. Maybe the current liabilities are missing some items, but the table shows only Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable summing to 624,988.48.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is correct.\n\nBut looking at the example, their quick ratio was 1.54 with similar items.\n\nMaybe in the example, they didn't include Interest Receivable, but it's a small amount.\n\nIf I exclude Interest Receivable:\nQuick Assets = 4,058,544.03 + 3,079,000.00 + 2,984,071.72 = 10,121,615.75\nQuick Ratio = 10,121,615.75 / 624,988.48 ≈ 16.19\n\nStill very high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Bank Deposits\" are not included in quick assets. Sometimes only \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" are included, which might be just \"Cash on Hand\".\n\nIf we take only Cash on Hand and Accounts Receivable:\nQuick Assets = 4,058,544.03 + 2,984,071.72 = 7,042,615.75\nQuick Ratio = 7,042,615.75 / 624,988.48 ≈ 11.27\n\nStill high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, and Accounts Receivable (excluding Interest Receivable):\n= 4,058,544.03 + 3,079,000.00 + 2,984,071.72 = 10,121,615.75\nRatio = 16.19\n\nGiven that, and since the example included all, perhaps the correct quick ratio is ~16.22.\n\nBut that seems unrealistic. Maybe the company has very high liquid assets and very low current liabilities.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the initial calculation.\n\n**Quick Ratio ≈ 16.22**\n\n### Calculating Net Profit Margin\n\nNet Profit = 1,903,401.82\nTotal Revenue = 4,879,769.51\n\nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n= (1,903,401.82 / 4,879,769.51) * 100\n\nCalculating the division:\n1,903,401.82 ÷ 4,879,769.51 ≈ ?\n\n4,879,769.51 × 0.39 ≈ ?\n4,879,769.51 × 0.4 = 1,951,907.804\nWe have 1,903,401.82, which is slightly less, so ~0.39\n\nMore precisely:\n1,903,401.82 / 4,879,769.51 ≈ 0.3900\n× 100 = 39.00%\n\nBut let's compute it more accurately:\n1,903,401.82 ÷ 4,879,769.51 ≈ 0.3900\nSo 39.00%\n\nBut in the example, the net profit was negative, and the margin was -30.29%.\n\nHere, net profit is positive, so margin is positive.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter calculating:\n\n- Quick Ratio = 10,134,895.35 / 624,988.48 ≈ 16.22\n- Net Profit Margin = (1,903,401.82 / 4,879,769.51) × 100 ≈ 39.00%\n\nBut the Quick Ratio seems unusually high. Maybe the correct quick assets are only Cash on Hand + Accounts Receivable (excluding Bank Deposits and Interest Receivable):\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Accounts Receivable = 4,058,544.03 + 2,984,071.72 = 7,042,615.75\nQuick Ratio = 7,042,615.75 / 624,988.48 ≈ 11.27\n\nStill high, but more reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable (excluding Interest Receivable):\n= 4,058,544.03 + 3,079,000.00 + 2,984,071.72 = 10,121,615.75\nQuick Ratio = 16.22\n\nGiven that, and since the example included all similar items, I think the correct Quick Ratio is ~16.22.\n\nBut to match typical definitions, perhaps the most accepted is:\n\nQuick Assets = Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable\nHere, Cash on Hand and Bank Deposits are cash, Accounts Receivable is included, Interest Receivable is usually included.\n\nSo Quick Assets = 4,058,544.03 + 3,079,000.00 + 2,984,071.72 + 13,279.60 = 10,134,895.35\nQuick Ratio = 10,134,895.35 / 624,988.48 ≈ 16.22\n\nGiven that, and since the company seems to have very high liquid assets compared to current liabilities, the Quick Ratio is indeed high.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '16.22', 'Net Profit Margin': '39.00%'} }\n```",
