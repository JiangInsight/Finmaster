                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to calculate the bank deposits item in the balance sheet, including both the initial and final amounts. Here's how we can approach this:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Initial Bank Deposit\nFrom the transactions data, we can see that there is an initial bank deposit recorded on 2023-12-31 with an amount of 5,000,000.00. This is clearly marked as \"Bank deposit\" in the type column.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Changes to Bank Deposits\nBank deposits can change due to transactions that involve bank transfers. We need to look for transactions where the payment method is \"Bank Transfer\" and the payment/receipt_status is \"Paid\". These transactions will either increase or decrease the bank deposits.\n\nFrom the data, the following transactions affect the bank deposits:\n1. Purchase20231231001: 20,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n2. Purchase20231231003: 20,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n3. Purchase20231231005: 20,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n4. Purchase20231231006: 60,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n5. Purchase20231231007: 200,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n6. Purchase20231231010: 10,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n7. Purchase20231231012: 60,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n8. Purchase20231231013: 3,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n9. Purchase20231231015: 10,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n10. Purchase20231231016: 15,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n11. Purchase20231231017: 100,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n12. Purchase20231231018: 100,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n13. Purchase20231231020: 20,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n14. Purchase20231231021: 60,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n15. Purchase20231231022: 100,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n16. Purchase20231231023: 15,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n17. Purchase20231231025: 100,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n18. Purchase20231231026: 300,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n19. Purchase20231231027: 60,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n20. Purchase20231231028: 5,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n21. Purchase20231231029: 200,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n22. Purchase20231231030: 300,000.00 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n\nTotal outflow from bank deposits: \n20,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 + 60,000 + 200,000 + 10,000 + 60,000 + 3,000 + 10,000 + 15,000 + 100,000 + 100,000 + 20,000 + 60,000 + 100,000 + 15,000 + 100,000 + 300,000 + 60,000 + 5,000 + 200,000 + 300,000 = 1,778,000.00\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the End Value of Bank Deposits\nThe initial bank deposit is 5,000,000.00. The total outflow is 1,778,000.00. Therefore, the end value of bank deposits is:\n\n5,000,000.00 - 1,778,000.00 = 3,222,000.00\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Bank Deposits Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Bank Deposits End Value': '3222000.00'} }\n```",
