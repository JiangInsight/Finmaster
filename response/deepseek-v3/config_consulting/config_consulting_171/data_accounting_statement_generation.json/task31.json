Identify all transactions with type \"Interest Receivables\":\n   - Interest20240101001: 443.21999999999997\n   - Interest20240102002: 443.21999999999997\n   - Interest20240103003: 441.44\n   - Interest20240104004: 439.65999999999997\n   - Interest20240105005: 416.52\n   - Interest20240106006: 416.52\n   - Interest20240107007: 389.731\n   - Interest20240108008: 388.84099999999995\n   - Interest20240109009: 388.84099999999995\n   - Interest20240110010: 383.234\n   - Interest20240111011: 383.234\n   - Interest20240112012: 383.056\n   - Interest20240113013: 380.83099999999996\n   - Interest20240114014: 371.931\n   - Interest20240115015: 371.931\n   - Interest20240116016: 371.931\n   - Interest20240117017: 363.031\n   - Interest20240118018: 363.031\n   - Interest20240119019: 363.031\n   - Interest20240120020: 363.031\n   - Interest20240121021: 361.251\n   - Interest20240122022: 361.251\n   - Interest20240123023: 361.251\n   - Interest20240124024: 359.916\n   - Interest20240125025: 359.916\n   - Interest20240126026: 359.916\n   - Interest20240127027: 359.916\n   - Interest20240128028: 351.01599999999996\n   - Interest20240129029: 351.01599999999996\n   - Interest20240130030: 351.01599999999996\n   - Interest20240131031: 324.316\n   - Interest20240201032: 318.531\n   - Interest20240202033: 318.531\n   - Interest20240203034: 300.731\n   - Interest20240204035: 300.731\n   - Interest20240205036: 274.031\n\n2. Sum all these amounts:\n   - 443.22 + 443.22 + 441.44 + 439.66 + 416.52 + 416.52 + 389.73 + 388.84 + 388.84 + 383.23 + 383.23 + 383.06 + 380.83 + 371.93 + 371.93 + 371.93 + 363.03 + 363.03 + 363.03 + 363.03 + 361.25 + 361.25 + 361.25 + 359.92 + 359.92 + 359.92 + 359.92 + 351.02 + 351.02 + 351.02 + 324.32 + 318.53 + 318.53 + 300.73 + 300.73 + 274.03 = 13,364.47\n\n3. The final interest income is the sum of all these amounts, which is 13,364.47.\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the solution was given as {'Interest Income': '2672.87'}, which suggests that perhaps only the positive interest amounts should be considered (excluding any negative values). But in this dataset, all the interest amounts are positive, so this doesn't apply here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe only the unpaid interest amounts should be considered, but in this dataset all interest transactions are marked as \"Unpaid\", so this also doesn't affect our calculation.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided and following the same approach as in the example, the correct interest income should be the sum of all interest receivables transactions, which is 13,364.47.\n\nBut since the example showed a much smaller number (2672.87), I suspect there might be a different calculation method intended. Perhaps we should only consider the interest amounts from January (since the example only had January data), or perhaps we should subtract some amounts. \n\nGiven that the instruction is to follow the same approach as the example, and since all interest amounts in this dataset are positive and marked as unpaid (just like in the example), the most straightforward calculation is to sum them all.\n\nHowever, to match the format of the example (which showed a 2-decimal place number), I'll present the sum rounded to 2 decimal places: 13,364.47.\n\nBut since this seems inconsistent with the example's smaller number, I might be missing something. Alternatively, maybe we're supposed to calculate the net change in interest receivables over the period, but that would require opening and closing balances which we don't have.\n\nGiven the information available and following the example's approach, the most reasonable answer is the sum of all interest receivable amounts.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Interest Income': '13364.47'} }\n```",
