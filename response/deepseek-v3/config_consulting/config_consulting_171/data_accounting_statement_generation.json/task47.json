Total Cash Inflows: Sum of all cash sales = 1,652,500.12\n   - Total Cash Outflows: Sum of all cash expenses and purchases = 3,347,499.88\n   - Net Cash Flow: 1,652,500.12 - 3,347,499.88 = -1,694,999.76\n\n5. **Ending Cash Balance**:\n   - Initial Cash: 8,000,000.0\n   - Net Cash Flow: -1,694,999.76\n   - Ending Cash Balance: 8,000,000.0 - 1,694,999.76 = 6,305,000.24\n\nHowever, upon reviewing the transactions, it seems there might be some discrepancies in the categorization of cash flows. For a more accurate calculation, we should only consider the transactions that directly affect cash and cash equivalents (i.e., those marked as \"Paid\" with payment method \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\"). \n\nAfter recalculating:\n- Total Cash Inflows (Sales Paid in Cash): 1,652,500.12\n- Total Cash Outflows (Expenses and Purchases Paid in Cash or Bank Transfer): 3,347,499.88\n- Net Cash Flow: -1,694,999.76\n- Ending Cash Balance: 8,000,000.0 - 1,694,999.76 = 6,305,000.24\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with the example provided, where the ending balance was much lower. Let's re-examine the transactions:\n\nUpon closer inspection, the initial deposits are likely the starting balances, and all subsequent transactions should adjust this balance. The correct approach is to sum all cash inflows and subtract all cash outflows from the initial deposits.\n\nAfter recalculating all cash inflows and outflows:\n- Initial Cash: 3,000,000.0 (Cash deposit) + 5,000,000.0 (Bank deposit) = 8,000,000.0\n- Cash Outflows: Sum of all expenses and purchases paid in cash or bank transfer = 3,347,499.88\n- Cash Inflows: Sum of all sales paid in cash = 1,652,500.12\n- Net Cash Flow: 1,652,500.12 - 3,347,499.88 = -1,694,999.76\n- Ending Cash Balance: 8,000,000.0 - 1,694,999.76 = 6,305,000.24\n\nThis still doesn't match the example, so perhaps the initial deposits are not part of the cash flow calculation. If we exclude the initial deposits and only consider the transactions:\n- Cash Outflows: 3,347,499.88\n- Cash Inflows: 1,652,500.12\n- Net Cash Flow: -1,694,999.76\n- Ending Cash Balance: -1,694,999.76 (which doesn't make sense)\n\nGiven the complexity, the most plausible ending cash balance based on the provided data is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Ending Balance': '6305000.24'} }\n```",
