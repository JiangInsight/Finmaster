Accounts payable represents the amount a company owes to its suppliers for purchases made on credit. \n\n### Steps to Calculate Accounts Payable:\n1. **Identify Initial Accounts Payable**: \n   - The initial accounts payable is the sum of all unpaid purchase transactions at the beginning of the period (2023-12-31) where the payment method is \"Account Payable\" or the payment/receipt_status is \"Unpaid\".\n\n2. **Identify Final Accounts Payable**:\n   - The final accounts payable is the sum of all unpaid purchase transactions at the end of the period (after all transactions up to the latest date in the data) where the payment method is \"Account Payable\" or the payment/receipt_status is \"Unpaid\".\n\n### Analysis of the Given Data:\n1. **Initial Accounts Payable**:\n   - There are no unpaid purchase transactions at the beginning of the period (2023-12-31) with payment method \"Account Payable\" or status \"Unpaid\". All initial purchases are either paid or do not specify \"Account Payable\".\n   - Therefore, the initial accounts payable is **0.00**.\n\n2. **Final Accounts Payable**:\n   - We need to look for purchase transactions where the payment method is \"Account Payable\" or the payment/receipt_status is \"Unpaid\".\n   - From the data, the following purchases are unpaid:\n     - `Purchase20231231011`: Amount = 300000.0, payment method = \"Account Payable\".\n     - `Purchase20231231019`: Amount = 1000.0, payment/receipt_status = \"Unpaid\".\n     - `Purchase20231231024`: Amount = 40000.0, payment method = \"Account Payable\".\n     - `Purchase20231231031`: Amount = 40000.0, payment method = \"Account Payable\".\n   - Sum of unpaid purchases: 300000.0 + 1000.0 + 40000.0 + 40000.0 = **381000.0**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accounts Payable End Value': '381000.00'} }\n```",
