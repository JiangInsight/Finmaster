Paid-in capital typically represents the amount of money that shareholders have invested in the company through the purchase of stock. \n\nFrom the given transactions data, we can identify the initial paid-in capital by looking at the initial deposits made into the company's accounts. These are typically labeled as \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", and \"Fixed Assets\" with the date \"2023-12-31\". \n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Paid-in Capital:**\n   - The initial transactions on 2023-12-31 are:\n     - Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n     - Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n     - Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.0\n   - The sum of these amounts is the initial paid-in capital:\n     - 3,000,000.0 (Cash) + 5,000,000.0 (Bank) + 5,000,000.0 (Fixed Assets) = 13,000,000.0\n\n2. **Determine Paid-in Capital End Value:**\n   - Paid-in capital typically does not change unless there are additional investments or withdrawals by shareholders. From the given transactions, there are no additional investments or withdrawals that would affect the paid-in capital after the initial deposits. \n   - Therefore, the end value of paid-in capital remains the same as the initial value: 13,000,000.0.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
