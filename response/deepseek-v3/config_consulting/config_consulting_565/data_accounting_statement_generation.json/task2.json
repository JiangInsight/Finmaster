                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to calculate the initial and final values of the bank deposits based on the given transactions data. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### 1. Identify Initial Bank Deposit\n- The initial bank deposit is explicitly given in the transactions data under the \"Bank deposit\" type with the date \"2023-12-31\".\n- From the data: \n  - `Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0 | ...`\n- The initial bank deposit is **5,000,000.00**.\n\n### 2. Calculate Bank Deposits End Value\nThe end value of the bank deposits is calculated by considering all transactions that affect the bank account (i.e., transactions where `payment_method` is \"Bank Transfer\" or \"Cash to bank transfer\"). \n\n#### Transactions Affecting Bank Deposits:\n1. **Purchases Paid via Bank Transfer**:\n   - `Purchase20231231002 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 1000.0 | 1000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer | ...` → **-1,000.00**\n   - `Purchase20231231004 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 1000.0 | 1000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer | ...` → **-1,000.00**\n   - `Purchase20231231005 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 20000.0 | 20000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer | ...` → **-20,000.00**\n   - `Purchase20231231006 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 10000.0 | 10000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer | ...` → **-10,000.00**\n   - `Purchase20231231010 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 3000.0 | 3000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer | ...` → **-3,000.00**\n   - `Purchase20231231011 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 200000.0 | 200000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer | ...` → **-200,000.00**\n   - `Purchase20231231012 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 20000.0 | 20000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer | ...` → **-20,000.00**\n   - `Purchase20231231022 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 1000.0 | 1000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer | ...` → **-1,000.00**\n\n   Total purchases paid via bank transfer: **-256,000.00**\n\n2. **Sales Paid via Bank Transfer**:\n   - There are no sales in the data where the payment method is \"Bank Transfer\". All sales are either \"Cash\" or \"Account Receivable\".\n\n3. **Cash to Bank Transfers**:\n   - There are no explicit \"Cash to bank transfer\" transactions in the given data (unlike the example where such transfers were present). \n\n4. **Other Transactions**:\n   - No other transactions affect the bank deposits directly (e.g., expenses are paid via \"Cash\", not \"Bank Transfer\").\n\n#### Calculation:\n- Initial Bank Deposit: **5,000,000.00**\n- Subtract purchases paid via bank transfer: **5,000,000.00 - 256,000.00 = 4,744,000.00**\n\n### 3. Final Bank Deposits Value\nThe final bank deposits value is **4,744,000.00**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Bank Deposits Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Bank Deposits End Value': '4744000.00'}}\n```",
