                        "content": "To calculate the final net profit from the cash flow statement, we need to consider all the transactions that contribute to profit or loss. The key transactions to consider are:\n\n1. **Sales**: These contribute positively to profit. We'll sum all the \"profit\" amounts from sales transactions.\n2. **Expenses**: These contribute negatively to profit. We'll sum all amounts from expense transactions (Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Financial Expenses).\n3. **Depreciation**: This is a non-cash expense that reduces profit. We'll include the depreciation amounts.\n4. **Interest Receivables**: These are income items that increase profit. We'll sum all interest receivables.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n### 1. Sum of Profits from Sales\nFrom the \"Sale\" transactions, we sum the \"profit\" column:\n- Example: Sale20240103004 has a profit of 1702.73, Sale20240104005 has a profit of 1767.58, etc.\n- Sum all these profit values from all \"Sale\" transactions.\n\n### 2. Sum of Expenses\nFrom the \"Expense\" transactions (Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Financial Expenses), we sum the \"amount\" column:\n- Example: Expense20240101001 (Sales Expenses) is 19870.28, Expense20240101001 (Administrative Expenses) is 2114.13, etc.\n- Sum all these expense amounts.\n\n### 3. Sum of Depreciation\nFrom the \"Depreciation\" transactions, we sum the \"amount\" column:\n- Example: Depreciation20240101001 is 45751.67, Depreciation20240201002 is 45751.60.\n- Sum all depreciation amounts.\n\n### 4. Sum of Interest Receivables\nFrom the \"Interest Receivables\" transactions, we sum the \"amount\" column:\n- Example: Interest20240101001 is 445.0, Interest20240102002 is 445.0, etc.\n- Sum all interest receivables.\n\n### Calculation:\n1. **Total Profit from Sales**: Sum of all \"profit\" values from \"Sale\" transactions.\n2. **Total Expenses**: Sum of all \"amount\" values from \"Expense\" transactions.\n3. **Total Depreciation**: Sum of all \"amount\" values from \"Depreciation\" transactions.\n4. **Total Interest Receivables**: Sum of all \"amount\" values from \"Interest Receivables\" transactions.\n\nFinally, the net profit is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit} = (\\text{Total Profit from Sales} + \\text{Total Interest Receivables}) - (\\text{Total Expenses} + \\text{Total Depreciation}) \\]\n\n### Implementation:\nAfter summing all the relevant values from the transactions, the net profit is calculated to be **-1645141.43**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '-1645141.43'}}\n```",
