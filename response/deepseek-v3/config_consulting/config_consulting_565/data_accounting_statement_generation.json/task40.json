Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Purchase Transactions\nWe look for all transactions where the type is \"Purchase\" (these increase inventory). From the data:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001: 2 units of Basic Consulting at $1000/unit → $2000\n2. Purchase20231231002: 1 unit of Basic Consulting at $1000/unit → $1000\n3. Purchase20231231003: 2 units of Enterprise Solution at $100000/unit → $200000\n4. Purchase20231231004: 1 unit of Basic Consulting at $1000/unit → $1000\n5. Purchase20231231005: 1 unit of Premium Consulting at $20000/unit → $20000\n6. Purchase20231231006: 2 units of Standard Consulting at $5000/unit → $10000\n7. Purchase20231231007: 3 units of Premium Consulting at $20000/unit → $60000 (Unpaid)\n8. Purchase20231231008: 3 units of Premium Consulting at $20000/unit → $60000\n9. Purchase20231231009: 3 units of Enterprise Solution at $100000/unit → $300000\n10. Purchase20231231010: 3 units of Basic Consulting at $1000/unit → $3000\n11. Purchase20231231011: 2 units of Enterprise Solution at $100000/unit → $200000\n12. Purchase20231231012: 1 unit of Premium Consulting at $20000/unit → $20000\n13.

Purchase20231231015: 1 unit of Premium Consulting at $20000/unit → $20000\n16. Purchase20231231016: 2 units of Enterprise Solution at $100000/unit → $200000 (Unpaid)\n17.

Purchase20231231022: 1 unit of Basic Consulting at $1000/unit → $1000\n\nTotal Purchases (including unpaid): \n= $2000 + $1000 + $200000 + $1000 + $20000 + $10000 + $60000 + $60000 + $300000 + $3000 + $200000 + $20000 + $10000 + $15000 + $20000 + $200000 + $1000 + $200000 + $300000 + $40000 + $20000 + $1000 \n= $1,583,000\n\n### Step 2: Identify Sale Transactions (Cost of Goods Sold)\nWe look for all sale transactions and sum their cost_amount (these decrease inventory).

Sale20240205072: $1000\n\nTotal Cost of Goods Sold: \n= $1000*5 (from Basic Consulting sales) \n+ $5000*6 (from Standard Consulting sales) \n+ $20000*10 (from Premium Consulting sales) \n+ $100000*11 (from Enterprise Solution sales) \n= $5000 + $30000 + $200000 + $1100000 \n= $1,335,000\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Net Inventory Change\nThe \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" is calculated as:\n= Total Purchases - Total Cost of Goods Sold\n= $1,583,000 - $1,335,000 \n= $248,000\n\nSince inventory increased (purchases > COGS), this will be shown as a negative value in the cash flow statement (cash outflow).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-248000.00'}}\n```",
