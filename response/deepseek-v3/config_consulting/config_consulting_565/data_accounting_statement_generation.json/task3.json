The inventory value is determined by the purchases and sales of products. Here's how we can approach this:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Initial Inventory\nFrom the given data, there are no initial inventory entries. Therefore, the initial inventory value is 0.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Total Purchases\nWe need to sum up all the purchase transactions where products are bought. These are transactions with the type \"Purchase\". \n\nFrom the data:\n- Purchase20231231001: 2000.0 (2 units of Basic Consulting at 1000.0 per unit)\n- Purchase20231231002: 1000.0 (1 unit of Basic Consulting at 1000.0 per unit)\n- Purchase20231231003: 200000.0 (2 units of Enterprise Solution at 100000.0 per unit)\n- Purchase20231231004: 1000.0 (1 unit of Basic Consulting at 1000.0 per unit)\n- Purchase20231231005: 20000.0 (1 unit of Premium Consulting at 20000.0 per unit)\n- Purchase20231231006: 10000.0 (2 units of Standard Consulting at 5000.0 per unit)\n- Purchase20231231007: 60000.0 (3 units of Premium Consulting at 20000.0 per unit)\n- Purchase20231231008: 60000.0 (3 units of Premium Consulting at 20000.0 per unit)\n- Purchase20231231009: 300000.0 (3 units of Enterprise Solution at 100000.0 per unit)\n- Purchase20231231010: 3000.0 (3 units of Basic Consulting at 1000.0 per unit)\n- Purchase20231231011: 200000.0 (2 units of Enterprise Solution at 100000.0 per unit)\n- Purchase20231231012: 20000.0 (1 unit of Premium Consulting at 20000.0 per unit)\n- Purchase20231231013: 10000.0 (2 units of Standard Consulting at 5000.0 per unit)\n- Purchase20231231014: 15000.0 (3 units of Standard Consulting at 5000.0 per unit)\n- Purchase20231231015: 20000.0 (1 unit of Premium Consulting at 20000.0 per unit)\n- Purchase20231231016: 200000.0 (2 units of Enterprise Solution at 100000.0 per unit)\n- Purchase20231231017: 1000.0 (1 unit of Basic Consulting at 1000.0 per unit)\n- Purchase20231231018: 200000.0 (2 units of Enterprise Solution at 100000.0 per unit)\n- Purchase20231231019: 300000.0 (3 units of Enterprise Solution at 100000.0 per unit)\n- Purchase20231231020: 40000.0 (2 units of Premium Consulting at 20000.0 per unit)\n- Purchase20231231021: 20000.0 (1 unit of Premium Consulting at 20000.0 per unit)\n- Purchase20231231022: 1000.0 (1 unit of Basic Consulting at 1000.0 per unit)\n\nSum of purchases:\n2000 + 1000 + 200000 + 1000 + 20000 + 10000 + 60000 + 60000 + 300000 + 3000 + 200000 + 20000 + 10000 + 15000 + 20000 + 200000 + 1000 + 200000 + 300000 + 40000 + 20000 + 1000 = 1,606,000.0\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\nCOGS is the cost amount from sales transactions. We sum up all the \"cost_amount\" fields from sales transactions.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Sale20240103004: 1000.0\n- Sale20240104005: 1000.0\n- Sale20240105007: 1000.0\n- Sale20240106009: 100000.0\n- Sale20240106010: 100000.0\n- Sale20240108014: 1000.0\n- Sale20240109016: 5000.0\n- Sale20240109017: 20000.0\n- Sale20240109018: 5000.0\n- Sale20240110019: 20000.0\n- Sale20240110020: 20000.0\n- Sale20240111022: 20000.0\n- Sale20240113025: 100000.0\n- Sale20240113026: 20000.0\n- Sale20240114028: 1000.0\n- Sale20240115029: 1000.0\n- Sale20240115030: 1000.0\n- Sale20240116032: 100000.0\n- Sale20240116033: 100000.0\n- Sale20240117035: 100000.0\n- Sale20240118037: 20000.0\n- Sale20240118038: 100000.0\n- Sale20240119040: 20000.0\n- Sale20240120042: 100000.0\n- Sale20240122045: 5000.0\n- Sale20240122046: 1000.0\n- Sale20240122047: 100000.0\n- Sale20240123048: 20000.0\n- Sale20240125050: 100000.0\n- Sale20240125051: 100000.0\n- Sale20240127055: 20000.0\n- Sale20240127056: 100000.0\n- Sale20240127057: 5000.0\n- Sale20240129060: 5000.0\n- Sale20240202063: 20000.0\n- Sale20240202064: 100000.0\n- Sale20240203065: 20000.0\n- Sale20240204068: 5000.0\n- Sale20240204069: 20000.0\n- Sale20240205070: 5000.0\n- Sale20240205071: 100000.0\n- Sale20240205072: 1000.0\n\nSum of COGS:\n1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 100000 + 100000 + 1000 + 5000 + 20000 + 5000 + 20000 + 20000 + 20000 + 100000 + 20000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 100000 + 100000 + 100000 + 20000 + 100000 + 20000 + 100000 + 5000 + 1000 + 100000 + 20000 + 100000 + 100000 + 20000 + 100000 + 5000 + 20000 + 100000 + 20000 + 5000 + 20000 + 5000 + 100000 + 1000 = 1,606,000.0\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Ending Inventory\nEnding Inventory = Initial Inventory + Purchases - COGS\nEnding Inventory = 0 + 1,606,000 - 1,606,000 = 0\n\nHowever, this seems incorrect because the sum of purchases and COGS are equal, which would imply no ending inventory. But looking back at the data, some purchases are unpaid (e.g., Purchase20231231001, Purchase20231231007, Purchase20231231016, Purchase20231231020), which might affect the inventory calculation. \n\nBut in accounting, unpaid purchases still increase inventory (as they are liabilities, not affecting inventory directly). Therefore, the correct ending inventory is indeed 0, as all purchased inventory has been sold.\n\nHowever, this contradicts the example provided, where the ending inventory was not zero. This suggests that perhaps not all purchases have been sold, or there might be an error in the calculation.\n\nUpon re-examining, the example had an ending inventory of 5,090,000, which suggests that the initial inventory was not zero. But in the given problem, there is no initial inventory entry, so we must assume it is zero.\n\nGiven the data, the most accurate calculation is:\n\nInitial Inventory: 0\nEnding Inventory: 0 (since all purchases have been sold)\n\nBut this seems unlikely, so perhaps the initial inventory is not zero. The problem does not provide initial inventory, so we must assume it is zero.\n\nGiven this, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Initial Value': '0.00', 'Inventory End Value': '0.00'} }\n```\n\nHowever, this seems inconsistent with the example. Perhaps the initial inventory is implied to be the sum of purchases, and the ending inventory is the remaining unsold inventory. But without clear initial inventory data, we cannot accurately calculate it. \n\nGiven the data provided, the most accurate answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Initial Value': '0.00', 'Inventory End Value': '0.00'} }\n```",
