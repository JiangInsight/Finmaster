Operating activities include cash received from customers and cash paid for expenses, purchases, and other operational costs. \n\n### Steps to Calculate Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:\n\n1. **Identify Cash Inflows from Operating Activities**:\n   - Cash received from customers (sales where payment/receipt_status is \"Paid\" and payment_method is \"Cash\").\n   - Interest received (if any, but in this case, all interest receivables are unpaid).\n\n2. **Identify Cash Outflows from Operating Activities**:\n   - Cash paid for purchases (where payment/receipt_status is \"Paid\" and payment_method is \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\").\n   - Cash paid for expenses (where payment/receipt_status is \"Paid\" and payment_method is \"Cash\").\n\n3. **Exclude Non-Cash and Non-Operating Activities**:\n   - Depreciation (non-cash expense).\n   - Fixed assets purchases (investing activity).\n   - Initial deposits (financing activity).\n   - Unpaid transactions (no cash flow impact).\n\n4. **Sum Up Cash Inflows and Outflows**:\n   - Total cash inflows from operating activities.\n   - Total cash outflows from operating activities.\n   - Net cash flow from operating activities = Total cash inflows - Total cash outflows.\n\n### Calculations:\n\n#### Cash Inflows from Operating Activities:\n- From sales where payment/receipt_status is \"Paid\" and payment_method is \"Cash\":\n  -
