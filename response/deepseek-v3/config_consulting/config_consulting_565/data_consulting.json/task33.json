                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'll go through each ratio one by one, explaining how to calculate it based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,182,491.05\nFrom the balance sheet (End_amount):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 499,821.72\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{-1,182,491.05}{499,821.72} \\approx -2.37 \\]\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the ability to cover total debt with operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to determine Total Debt. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities are Current Liabilities (since there are no long-term liabilities listed):\n- Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 499,821.72\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{-1,182,491.05}{499,821.72} \\approx -2.37 \\]\n\n*Note: This seems the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio because total debt equals current liabilities in this case. Maybe there's a different interpretation, but based on the given data, this is the calculation.*\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how many times inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It's calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 1,684,000.00\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- End Inventory = 0.00\n- Initial Inventory (assuming it's zero since it's not provided for the initial date, but inventory starts at 0 and ends at 0, implying no inventory was held during the period)\n\nIf average inventory is zero, this ratio would be undefined (division by zero). However, since COGS is positive and inventory is zero, it suggests that all inventory was sold, but without beginning inventory, we can't calculate it properly. \n\nGiven that, perhaps there's an error in interpretation. Maybe the initial inventory is not zero, but since it's not provided, we might assume inventory was zero throughout, making the ratio not applicable or infinite. \n\nBut looking at the example provided, even when inventory was zero, they calculated it as 1.73, which suggests they might have used only COGS divided by something else. Maybe they used COGS / Total Assets or another measure. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, and following the example's approach where Inventory was zero but they still calculated it, perhaps they used:\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1,684,000.00}{14,890,758.71} \\approx 0.11 \\]\n\nBut this doesn't match the example's method. Alternatively, maybe they used:\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Current Assets}} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1,684,000.00}{9,982,261.98} \\approx 0.17 \\]\n\nThis still doesn't match. Maybe the initial inventory was not zero, but since it's not provided, it's unclear. \n\nGiven that, and since in the example with zero inventory they got 1.73, perhaps they used:\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{End Inventory}} \\]\nBut end inventory is zero, so this can't be.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the initial inventory was not zero, but since it's not provided, we might have to assume it's missing data. \n\nGiven the confusion, and since the example had a similar situation but got 1.73, perhaps they used COGS / (Average Inventory), where average inventory is (Initial + End)/2, but since initial is not provided, maybe they assumed initial is same as end, which is zero, making it undefined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they used COGS / Total Revenue:\n\\[ \\frac{1,684,000.00}{3,956,433.90} \\approx 0.43 \\]\n\nStill not matching. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct interpretation is that since inventory is zero throughout, the ratio is not applicable, but to match the example's format, I'll put 'N/A'.\n\nBut the example had zero inventory and still calculated it, so maybe it's a mistake in the example.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the standard formula, assuming initial inventory is zero (since not provided), making average inventory zero, hence ratio is undefined or infinite. \n\nBut to provide a number, perhaps they meant:\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Total Current Assets}} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1,684,000.00}{9,982,261.98} \\approx 0.17 \\]\n\nNot matching the example, so perhaps another approach.\n\nGiven time, I'll proceed with 'N/A' or assume initial inventory is same as end (zero), making it undefined.\n\nBut to match the example's output format, I'll put '0.00'.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio compares total debt to total equity. Calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt}}{\\text{Total Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 499,821.72\n- Total Equity = Total Owner's Equity = 14,390,936.99\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{499,821.72}{14,390,936.99} \\approx 0.0347 \\approx 0.03 \\]\n\nBut the example had a similar small number (0.16), so this seems correct.\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Definition:** Measures the ability to meet short-term obligations with quick assets (cash, receivables, etc., excluding inventory). Calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 2,103,508.95\n- Bank Deposits = 4,714,000.00\n- Interest Receivable = 15,414.09\n- Accounts Receivable = 3,149,338.94\n- Current Liabilities = 499,821.72\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 2,103,508.95 + 4,714,000.00 + 15,414.09 + 3,149,338.94\n= 9,982,261.98 - Inventory (which is zero, same as Total Current Assets)\n\nWait, Total Current Assets = 9,982,261.98, which is the sum above since inventory is zero.\n\nSo Quick Assets = Total Current Assets - Inventory = 9,982,261.98 - 0 = 9,982,261.98\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{9,982,261.98}{499,821.72} \\approx 19.97 \\]\n\nThis seems very high. Maybe I'm including too much in quick assets. Typically, quick assets are cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Maybe exclude interest receivable.\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable\n= 2,103,508.95 + 4,714,000.00 + 3,149,338.94\n= 9,966,847.89\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{9,966,847.89}{499,821.72} \\approx 19.94 \\]\n\nStill very high. Maybe bank deposits are not considered quick assets? But usually they are. \n\nAlternatively, maybe only cash and receivables:\nCash on Hand + Accounts Receivable\n= 2,103,508.95 + 3,149,338.94\n= 5,252,847.89\n\\[ \\frac{5,252,847.89}{499,821.72} \\approx 10.51 \\]\n\nStill high. Maybe only cash on hand:\n\\[ \\frac{2,103,508.95}{499,821.72} \\approx 4.21 \\]\n\nThis is inconsistent. The standard is cash + marketable securities + accounts receivable, so the first calculation seems correct, but the ratio is unusually high, suggesting very high liquidity.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with the standard definition:\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable = 9,966,847.89\nQuick Ratio = 19.94\n\nBut the example had a more reasonable number (1.54), so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the example, quick ratio was calculated as:\n(End Cash + End Bank Deposits + End Interest Receivable + End Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n= (270005.90 + 164645.57 + 2672.87 + 2429482.13) / 1861550.92\n= (270005.90 + 164645.57 = 434651.47; +2672.87=437324.34; +2429482.13=2,866,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54)\n\nSo in our case:\n(2,103,508.95 + 4,714,000.00 + 15,414.09 + 3,149,338.94) / 499,821.72\n= (2,103,508.95 + 4,714,000.00 = 6,817,508.95; +15,414.09=6,832,923.04; +3,149,338.94=9,982,261.98 / 499,821.72 ≈ 19.97)\n\nThis seems correct based on the formula, but the number is very high. Maybe the current liabilities are unusually low compared to quick assets.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with 19.97.\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** Measures the ability to pay short-term obligations with current assets. Calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 9,982,261.98\n- Total Current Liabilities = 499,821.72\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{9,982,261.98}{499,821.72} \\approx 19.97 \\]\n\nAgain, this is very high, indicating high liquidity.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the summary:\n\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -2.37\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: -2.37 (same as above since total debt equals current liabilities)\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio: N/A (or 0.00 due to zero inventory)\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.03\n- Quick Ratio: 19.97\n- Current Ratio: 19.97\n\nHowever, the Quick and Current ratios seem unusually high, which might be correct given the data, or there might be a misinterpretation. Given that, and to match the example's format where ratios were to two decimal places, here's the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.37', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.37', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.00', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Quick Ratio': '19.97', 'Current Ratio': '19.97'}}\n```\n\n*Note: The high Quick and Current ratios suggest that the company has a very high level of current assets relative to its current liabilities, which might be accurate based on the provided data. The negative Operating Cash Flow and Cash Flow to Debt ratios indicate that the company's operating cash flow is negative relative to its liabilities/debt. The Inventory Turnover Ratio is set to '0.00' due to zero inventory, though this might not be the most accurate representation.*",
