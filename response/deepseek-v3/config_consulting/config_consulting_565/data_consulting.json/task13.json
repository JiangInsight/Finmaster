                        "content": "To calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio, we use the following formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\nFrom the income statement, the Cost of Goods Sold is given as:\n\\[ \\text{COGS} = 1,684,000.00 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Average Inventory\nThe average inventory is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Inventory (Initial_amount for Inventory on 2023-12-31) = 0.00\n- Ending Inventory (End_amount for Inventory on 2024-02-05) = 0.00\n\nThus:\n\\[ \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{0.00 + 0.00}{2} = 0.00 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio\nSince the average inventory is 0, the denominator is 0. Division by zero is undefined, which implies that the Inventory Turnover Ratio cannot be calculated in this scenario. However, in practical terms, if there is no inventory held during the period, the ratio is not applicable.\n\nBut in the context of the given data, we can consider that the inventory was 0 throughout the period, so the ratio is effectively infinite or not calculable. However, since the problem expects a numerical answer, we might interpret this as 0 or undefined, but the example provided suggests that a numerical answer is expected even when inventory is 0 at the end. \n\nGiven that the example had a non-zero inventory and the problem has zero inventory, the ratio is not calculable in a meaningful way. However, to align with the format, we might represent this as \"N/A\" or \"0\", but the example suggests that a numerical answer is expected. \n\nGiven that the inventory is 0, the ratio is technically undefined, but for the sake of the problem, we might represent it as 0.\n\nHowever, in the example provided, the inventory was 0 at the beginning and 5,090,000 at the end, and the ratio was calculated as 1.73. This suggests that the average inventory was used, and the COGS was divided by the average inventory. \n\nIn this problem, since both beginning and ending inventory are 0, the average inventory is 0, and the ratio is undefined. But to provide a numerical answer, we might represent it as 0.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Turnover Ratio': 'N/A'} }\n```\n\nHowever, since the example provided a numerical answer even when inventory was 0 at the beginning, and the problem expects a numerical answer, we might represent it as 0:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0'} }\n```\n\nBut the most accurate representation is \"N/A\" because division by zero is undefined. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, and since the example provided a numerical answer, I will provide \"N/A\" as the most accurate representation.\n\n### Correct Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Turnover Ratio': 'N/A'} }\n```\n\nHowever, the example suggests that the ratio is calculated even when inventory is 0 at the beginning, so perhaps the average inventory is taken as the ending inventory. If we follow that logic:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{0 + 0}{2} = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{1,684,000}{0} \\]\n\nThis is still undefined. \n\nGiven that, the answer is \"N/A\". \n\nBut the example suggests that the ratio is calculated as COGS / Average Inventory, where Average Inventory is (Beginning + Ending) / 2. \n\nIn the example:\n- Beginning Inventory = 0\n- Ending Inventory = 5,090,000\n- Average Inventory = (0 + 5,090,000) / 2 = 2,545,000\n- COGS = 4,410,000\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 = 1.73 (as in the example)\n\nIn this problem:\n- Beginning Inventory = 0\n- Ending Inventory = 0\n- Average Inventory = (0 + 0) / 2 = 0\n- COGS = 1,684,000\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = 1,684,000 / 0 = undefined\n\nThus, the answer is \"N/A\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Turnover Ratio': 'N/A'} }\n```",
