                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Asset Ratio\nFirst, what is the Debt to Asset Ratio? From what I understand, it's a financial metric that shows the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nBut sometimes, \"Total Debt\" can be interpreted as \"Total Liabilities.\" In the context of a balance sheet, liabilities are the debts the company owes. So, we can consider Total Liabilities as the numerator.\n\n### Identifying the Components from the Balance Sheet\nLooking at the provided balance sheet, we need two things:\n1. **Total Liabilities**: This is the sum of all the company's debts or obligations.\n2. **Total Assets**: This is the sum of everything the company owns.\n\nFrom the table:\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: At the end date (2024-02-05), this is 499,821.72.\n- I don't see any \"Non-current Liabilities\" or \"Long-term Liabilities\" listed, which means the company might not have any long-term debt beyond the current liabilities. So, Total Liabilities would just be the Total Current Liabilities.\n  \nWait, let me check the table again to ensure I'm not missing any liabilities:\n- Accounts Payable: 302,000.00\n- Taxes Payable: 197,821.72\n- Total Current Liabilities: 499,821.72 (which is the sum of the above)\n- No other liabilities are listed, so Total Liabilities = 499,821.72\n\n- **Total Assets**: At the end date, this is 14,890,758.71.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{499,821.72}{14,890,758.71} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{499,821.72}{14,890,758.71} \\approx 0.03356 \\]\n\nRounding this to two decimal places gives approximately 0.03.\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nJust to be sure, let's verify:\n- Total Liabilities: 499,821.72\n- Total Assets: 14,890,758.71\n- Ratio: 499,821.72 / 14,890,758.71 ≈ 0.03356 or 3.36%\n\nExpressed as a decimal to two places: 0.03\n\n### Final Answer\nSo, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.03.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03'} }\n```\n\n### Additional Check\nLooking back at the example provided:\n- Their Total Current Liabilities were 1,861,550.92\n- Total Assets were 13,216,409.49\n- Ratio was 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.1409, rounded to 0.14\n\nThis matches their given solution, so my approach seems correct. In the current problem, since there are no long-term liabilities, the ratio is lower.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter carefully going through the numbers and verifying the calculation, the Debt to Asset Ratio is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03'} }\n```",
