                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. We have three financial statements: the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement. We need to calculate three ratios:\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio**\n2. **Net Profit Margin**\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio**\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of debt financing relative to shareholders' equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 499,821.72\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 499,821.72\n- **Total Owner's Equity (End_amount):** 14,390,936.99\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{499,821.72}{14,390,936.99} \\]\n\nLet's compute that:\n\\[ \\frac{499,821.72}{14,390,936.99} \\approx 0.0347 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.03\n\nBut looking at the example, it seems they might have considered more liabilities if any. Here, only current liabilities are present, so it's just that.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net profit is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** 1,390,936.99\n- **Total Revenue:** 3,956,433.90\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,390,936.99}{3,956,433.90} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nCompute the division first:\n\\[ \\frac{1,390,936.99}{3,956,433.90} \\approx 0.3516 \\]\n\nThen multiply by 100%:\n\\[ 0.3516 \\times 100\\% \\approx 35.16\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to cover its current liabilities with cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -1,182,491.05\n- From the balance sheet:\n  - **Total Current Liabilities:** 499,821.72\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-1,182,491.05}{499,821.72} \\]\n\nCompute the division:\n\\[ \\frac{-1,182,491.05}{499,821.72} \\approx -2.366 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: -2.37\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Net Profit Margin': '35.16%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.37'}}\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the Debt to Equity Ratio was calculated including all liabilities over equity. Here, since there are no non-current liabilities, the ratio is quite low. \n\nSimilarly, the Net Profit Margin is positive here unlike the example, and the operating cash flow is negative leading to a negative ratio.\n\nEverything checks out based on the given data. \n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Net Profit Margin': '35.16%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.37'}}\n```",
