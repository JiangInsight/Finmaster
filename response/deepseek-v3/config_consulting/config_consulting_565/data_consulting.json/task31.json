                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the five requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:** Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all revenue is credit sales) = Main Business Revenue = 3,956,433.90\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable (Initial_amount) = 0.00\n- Ending Accounts Receivable (End_amount) = 3,149,338.94\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning + Ending) / 2 = (0 + 3,149,338.94) / 2 = 1,574,669.47\n\n**Calculation:**\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 3,956,433.90 / 1,574,669.47 ≈ 2.51\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Operating Cash Flow = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,182,491.05\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 499,821.72\n\n**Calculation:**\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -1,182,491.05 / 499,821.72 ≈ -2.37\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio in this context since both use Operating Cash Flow and Current Liabilities. So, it's also -2.37.\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:** Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Sales = Total Revenue = 3,956,433.90\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets = 14,890,758.71\n- Average Total Assets = (13,000,000 + 14,890,758.71) / 2 = 13,945,379.36\n\n**Calculation:**\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = 3,956,433.90 / 13,945,379.36 ≈ 0.28\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 499,821.72\n- Total Shareholders' Equity = Total Owner's Equity = 14,390,936.99\n\n**Calculation:**\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 499,821.72 / 14,390,936.99 ≈ 0.03\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.51', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-2.37', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.37', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.28', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:**\n   - 3,956,433.90 / 1,574,669.47 ≈ 2.51 (correct)\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio:**\n   - -1,182,491.05 / 499,821.72 ≈ -2.37 (correct)\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio:**\n   - Same as above: -2.37 (correct)\n\n4. **Total Asset Turnover Ratio:**\n   - 3,956,433.90 / 13,945,379.36 ≈ 0.28 (correct)\n\n5. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - 499,821.72 / 14,390,936.99 ≈ 0.03 (correct)\n\nEverything checks out! The ratios are calculated correctly based on the provided financial data.",
