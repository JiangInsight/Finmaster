                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nFirst, what is the Debt to Equity Ratio? From what I understand, it's a financial metric that compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholders' equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nThis ratio gives an idea of how much debt a company is using to finance its assets relative to the value of shareholders' equity.\n\n### Identifying the Necessary Components\n\nFrom the balance sheet provided, I need to identify:\n\n1. **Total Liabilities**: This is the sum of all the company's debts or obligations.\n2. **Total Owner's Equity**: This represents the owners' claims after all liabilities have been paid off.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet:\n\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: This is given as 499,821.72 at the end date (2024-02-05).\n- **Total Non-current Liabilities**: Hmm, the balance sheet doesn't explicitly list non-current liabilities. It only shows current liabilities under \"Total Current Liabilities\" and then jumps to \"Paid-in Capital\" and \"Retained Earnings,\" which are part of owner's equity.\n  \nWait a minute, in the balance sheet, after \"Total Current Liabilities,\" the next items are \"Paid-in Capital,\" \"Retained Earnings,\" and \"Total Owner's Equity.\" There's no line item for long-term debt or non-current liabilities. \n\nThis suggests that the company might not have any long-term debt or non-current liabilities at the end of the reporting period. So, the total liabilities would just be the total current liabilities, which is 499,821.72.\n\n- **Total Owner's Equity**: This is given as 14,390,936.99 at the end date.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nNow, plugging these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} = \\frac{499,821.72}{14,390,936.99} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{499,821.72}{14,390,936.99} \\approx 0.0347 \\]\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 0.0347.\n\n### Verifying the Components\n\nJust to make sure I didn't miss anything:\n\n- **Total Liabilities**: Only current liabilities are present (Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable sum up to Total Current Liabilities). No other liabilities are listed.\n- **Total Owner's Equity**: Clearly given as the sum of Paid-in Capital and Retained Earnings.\n\nEverything checks out. There are no other liabilities beyond the current ones listed.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.03.\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the ratio was given to two decimal places, so I'll follow that format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03'} }\n```\n\n### Wait a Second...\n\nLooking again at the example, the solution was {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.16'}, which is a ratio less than 1, similar to what I got. But in my case, the ratio is even smaller because the liabilities are relatively small compared to the equity.\n\nBut just to double-check, is there any possibility that I missed some liabilities? The balance sheet seems to list all liabilities under current liabilities, and there's no separate line for long-term debt or other non-current liabilities. So, I think it's correct to consider only the current liabilities.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes \"Total Liabilities\" might be derived from \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" minus \"Total Owner's Equity\". Let's try that:\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity at end date: 14,890,758.71\n- Total Owner's Equity at end date: 14,390,936.99\n\nSo, Total Liabilities = Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity - Total Owner's Equity\n= 14,890,758.71 - 14,390,936.99 = 499,821.72\n\nThis matches the \"Total Current Liabilities\" figure, confirming that there are no other liabilities beyond the current ones.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully reviewing the balance sheet and verifying the calculations, the Debt to Equity Ratio is indeed 0.03.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03'} }\n```",
