These typically include:\n   - Cash on Hand\n   - Bank Deposits\n   - Interest Receivable\n   - Accounts Receivable\n   - (Note: Inventory is excluded because it is not as liquid as the other current assets.)\n\n2. **Identify Current Liabilities**: These are liabilities that are due within one year. In this case, it is the \"Total Current Liabilities.\"\n\n3. **Calculate Quick Ratio**: The formula for the Quick Ratio is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Quick Assets**:\n   - Cash on Hand: 2,103,508.95\n   - Bank Deposits: 4,714,000.00\n   - Interest Receivable: 15,414.09\n   - Accounts Receivable: 3,149,338.94\n   - Total Quick Assets = 2,103,508.95 + 4,714,000.00 + 15,414.09 + 3,149,338.94 = 9,982,261.98\n\n   (Note: The \"Total Current Assets\" is also 9,982,261.98, which matches the sum of the quick assets because Inventory is 0.00 in this case.)\n\n2. **Current Liabilities**:\n   - Total Current Liabilities: 499,821.72\n\n3. **Quick Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{9,982,261.98}{499,821.72} \\approx 19.97\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '19.97'} }\n```",
