                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: This ratio measures a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   Here, \"Total Debt\" can be considered as the \"Total Current Liabilities\" from the balance sheet unless specified otherwise.\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the **Income Statement**:\n- Total Revenue: \\$3,956,433.90\n- Gross Profit: \\$2,272,433.90\n\nFrom the **Cash Flow Statement**:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$1,182,491.05\n\nFrom the **Balance Sheet**:\n- Total Current Liabilities: \\$499,821.72\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,272,433.90}{3,956,433.90} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\\[\n\\frac{2,272,433.90}{3,956,433.90} \\approx 0.5743\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\\[\n0.5743 \\times 100 \\approx 57.43\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **57.43%**.\n\n### Calculating Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-1,182,491.05}{499,821.72}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{-1,182,491.05}{499,821.72} \\approx -2.366\n\\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-2.37**.\n\n### Verifying Total Debt\n\nI initially considered \"Total Current Liabilities\" as \"Total Debt\". However, looking back at the balance sheet, there's no long-term debt listed, only current liabilities. So, it seems appropriate to use Total Current Liabilities as the total debt in this context.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter performing the calculations:\n\n- Gross Profit Margin: 57.43%\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: -2.37\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided in the task, the Gross Profit Margin was rounded to two decimal places, and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio was also presented with two decimal places. Following that format:\n\n- Gross Profit Margin: 57.43%\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: -2.37\n\nBut in the example, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio was given as '-3.90', which seems to be a direct division without rounding to two decimal places. Maybe it's presented with one decimal place. Let's see:\n\nOur calculation: -1,182,491.05 / 499,821.72 ≈ -2.366, which could be -2.37 or -2.4.\n\nBut to match the example's style (which had '-3.90'), maybe it's to two decimal places. So, -2.37 seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, Gross Profit Margin is 57.43%.\n\nBut in the example, it was '18.80%', which is to two decimal places. So, our 57.43% seems correctly formatted.\n\n### Possible Missteps\n\nWait a minute, is \"Total Debt\" really just \"Total Current Liabilities\"? In the example provided, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio was calculated as -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.90, where 1,861,550.92 was \"Total Current Liabilities\". So, it seems they used Total Current Liabilities as Total Debt.\n\nIn our case, Total Current Liabilities is 499,821.72, so that seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the Gross Profit Margin calculation:\n\nGross Profit = 2,272,433.90\nTotal Revenue = 3,956,433.90\n\n2,272,433.90 / 3,956,433.90 = 0.5743 → 57.43%\n\nThat seems correct.\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nAfter careful consideration, the calculations seem correct. Here's the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '57.43%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.37'} }\n```",
