                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio based on the given cash flow statement. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's understand what the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is. This ratio compares the cash generated from operating activities to the net income of the company. It's a measure of how well a company's net income is being converted into actual cash flow from operations. \n\nThe formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit (Net Income)}} \\]\n\nFrom the given data, we have:\n\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = 1,390,936.99\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,182,491.05\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nNow, let's plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-1,182,491.05}{1,390,936.99} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-1,182,491.05}{1,390,936.99} \\approx -0.850 \\]\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately -0.85.\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nWait a minute, in the example provided, the ratio was positive (4.41), but here our ratio is negative. Is that possible? \n\nYes, it's possible. The ratio can be negative if either the net cash flow from operating activities is negative or the net income is negative (or both). In this case, the net income is positive, but the operating cash flow is negative, leading to a negative ratio. \n\nThis indicates that even though the company reported a net profit, its operating activities actually used up cash instead of generating it. This could be due to significant increases in working capital (like increases in accounts receivable or inventory) that aren't covered by increases in accounts payable or other operating cash inflows.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter calculating, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is approximately -0.85. \n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the ratio was presented as a positive number (4.41), even though the net cash flow from operating activities was negative (-7,259,994.10) and net profit was also negative (-1,645,141.43). \n\nWait, in the example:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-7,259,994.10}{-1,645,141.43} \\approx 4.41 \\]\n\nSo, two negatives make a positive. \n\nIn our case, one is negative, and one is positive, so the ratio is negative. That makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the correct ratio is -0.85.\n\nBut looking at the format, the example had the ratio as a string ('4.41'), so we'll present ours similarly.\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\n-0.850 → -0.85\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.85'} }\n```\n\n### Double-Checking the Numbers\n\nJust to be sure, let's list out the numbers:\n\n- Net Profit: 1,390,936.99\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -1,182,491.05\n\nCalculation:\n\n-1,182,491.05 / 1,390,936.99 ≈ -0.850\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully calculating and verifying, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is indeed -0.85.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.85'} }\n```",
