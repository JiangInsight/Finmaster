                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through them step by step, explaining how I calculate each one based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,182,491.05\n\nFrom the balance sheet (End_amount):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 499,821.72\n\nCalculation:\n- -1,182,491.05 / 499,821.72 ≈ -2.37\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 499,821.72 (this is the only liability, no long-term debt mentioned)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,390,936.99\n\nCalculation:\n- 499,821.72 / 14,390,936.99 ≈ 0.0347 or 0.03 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n*Note:* If we consider only current liabilities as debt, the ratio is very low. Sometimes, \"Debt\" includes all liabilities, but here it seems only current liabilities are present.\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 3,956,433.90\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets = 14,890,758.71\n- Average Total Assets = (13,000,000 + 14,890,758.71) / 2 = 13,945,379.355\n\nCalculation:\n- 3,956,433.90 / 13,945,379.355 ≈ 0.28\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 9,982,261.98\n- Inventory = 0.00\n- Current Liabilities = 499,821.72\n\nCalculation:\n- (9,982,261.98 - 0) / 499,821.72 ≈ 19.97\n\n*This seems unusually high; perhaps I missed something. Let me check current assets components:*\n- Cash on Hand: 2,103,508.95\n- Bank Deposits: 4,714,000.00\n- Interest Receivable: 15,414.09\n- Accounts Receivable: 3,149,338.94\n- Inventory: 0.00\nTotal = 2,103,508.95 + 4,714,000 + 15,414.09 + 3,149,338.94 = 9,982,261.98 (matches)\nSo, quick ratio is indeed (9,982,261.98) / 499,821.72 ≈ 19.97\n\n*This suggests the company has a lot of liquid assets compared to current liabilities.*\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nThis is the same as the first ratio:\n- -1,182,491.05 / 499,821.72 ≈ -2.37\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Income / Average Shareholder's Equity\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = 1,390,936.99\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Owner's Equity = 13,000,000.00\n- End Total Owner's Equity = 14,390,936.99\n- Average Equity = (13,000,000 + 14,390,936.99) / 2 = 13,695,468.495\n\nCalculation:\n- 1,390,936.99 / 13,695,468.495 ≈ 0.1016 or 10.16%\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since no info on cash sales):\n- Net Sales = 3,956,433.90\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00\n- End Accounts Receivable = 3,149,338.94\n- Average AR = (0 + 3,149,338.94) / 2 = 1,574,669.47\n\nCalculation:\n- 3,956,433.90 / 1,574,669.47 ≈ 2.51\n\n*However, if initial AR is 0, this might imply all sales happened within the period, so the ratio could be higher. Alternatively, if we use ending AR only (as sometimes done when beginning is zero):*\n- 3,956,433.90 / 3,149,338.94 ≈ 1.26\n\n*Common practice is to use average, but with beginning at zero, it might skew. Let's stick with average for consistency: 2.51*\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.37', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.28', 'Quick Ratio': '19.97', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.37', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '10.16%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.51'}}\n```\n\n*Note on Quick Ratio: The quick ratio is unusually high because the company has a large amount of cash and receivables relative to very small current liabilities. This might be correct given the data, but it's worth double-checking if all current liabilities are accounted for.*",
