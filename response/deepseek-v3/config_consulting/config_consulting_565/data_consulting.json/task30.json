                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 9,982,261.98\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 499,821.72\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 9,982,261.98 / 499,821.72 ≈ 19.97\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 2,103,508.95\n- Bank Deposits = 4,714,000.00 (assuming these are cash equivalents)\n- Accounts Receivable = 3,149,338.94\n- Total Quick Assets = 2,103,508.95 + 4,714,000.00 + 3,149,338.94 = 9,966,847.89\n- Total Current Liabilities = 499,821.72\n\nCalculation:\nQuick Ratio = 9,966,847.89 / 499,821.72 ≈ 19.94\n\n*Note:* Inventory is 0 in this case, so Quick Ratio is almost the same as Current Ratio.\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 499,821.72 (since there are no non-current liabilities listed)\n- Total Assets = 14,890,758.71\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 499,821.72 / 14,890,758.71 ≈ 0.0336 or 0.03 (rounded)\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 499,821.72\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,390,936.99\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 499,821.72 / 14,390,936.99 ≈ 0.0347 or 0.03 (rounded)\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,182,491.05\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 499,821.72\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -1,182,491.05 / 499,821.72 ≈ -2.37\n\n*Note:* A negative ratio indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative, which isn't favorable for covering debt.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '19.97', 'Quick Ratio': '19.94', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.37'}}\n```\n\n### Verification:\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. **Current Ratio:** 9,982,261.98 / 499,821.72 ≈ 19.97 ✔\n2. **Quick Ratio:** (2,103,508.95 + 4,714,000.00 + 3,149,338.94) / 499,821.72 ≈ 19.94 ✔\n3. **Debt to Asset:** 499,821.72 / 14,890,758.71 ≈ 0.03 ✔\n4. **Debt to Equity:** 499,821.72 / 14,390,936.99 ≈ 0.03 ✔\n5. **Cash Flow to Debt:** -1,182,491.05 / 499,821.72 ≈ -2.37 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The company has a very high current and quick ratio, indicating strong short-term liquidity. The debt ratios are very low, suggesting minimal debt relative to assets and equity. However, the negative cash flow to debt ratio is a concern, showing that operating activities aren't generating enough cash to cover debt, though the debt itself is quite small.",
