                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. We'll calculate three ratios: Debt to Asset Ratio, Gross Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow Ratio. \n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities here):** 499,821.72\n- **Total Assets:** 14,890,758.71\n\nWait a minute, in the balance sheet, under \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity,\" it's 14,890,758.71, which matches Total Assets (as it should). The liabilities are just the \"Total Current Liabilities\" of 499,821.72. There's no mention of long-term liabilities, so we'll assume that's all the debt.\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{499,821.72}{14,890,758.71} \\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{499,821.72}{14,890,758.71} \\approx 0.03356 \\]\n\nSo, approximately 0.034 or 3.4%.\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the ratio was given as '0.14', which is a higher proportion. Maybe I missed something. Let me check the balance sheet again.\n\nAh! Maybe \"Total Liabilities\" includes both current and non-current liabilities. In the given balance sheet, under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" it's 499,821.72, and there's no separate line for non-current liabilities. So, total liabilities are just the current liabilities here.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct: ~0.034.\n\nBut the example had a similar structure, and their ratio was higher. Maybe they included something else as debt. Alternatively, perhaps \"Total Liabilities\" is \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" minus \"Total Owner's Equity.\"\n\nLet me try that:\n\nTotal Liabilities and Owner's Equity: 14,890,758.71\nTotal Owner's Equity: 14,390,936.99\n\nSo, Total Liabilities = Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity - Total Owner's Equity\n= 14,890,758.71 - 14,390,936.99\n= 499,821.72\n\nSame as before. So, seems like the ratio is indeed ~0.034.\n\nBut the example had:\n\nTotal Liabilities and Owner's Equity: 13,216,409.49\nTotal Owner's Equity: 11,354,858.57\nSo, Total Liabilities = 13,216,409.49 - 11,354,858.57 = 1,861,550.92\nTotal Assets: 13,216,409.49\nDebt to Asset = 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.14\n\nAh, in the example, \"Total Current Liabilities\" was 1,861,550.92, which matches this calculation. So, in our case, it's the same method.\n\nSo, our calculation is correct: 499,821.72 / 14,890,758.71 ≈ 0.0336 or 3.36%. Let's round to two decimal places: 0.03.\n\nBut the example was to one decimal place ('0.14'), so maybe we'll present as '0.03'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's more debt not listed. But based on the given data, this seems correct.\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 2,272,433.90\n- **Total Revenue:** 3,956,433.90\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,272,433.90}{3,956,433.90} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nCalculate the division first:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2,272,433.90}{3,956,433.90} \\approx 0.5743 \\]\n\nThen multiply by 100%:\n\n\\[ 0.5743 \\times 100\\% \\approx 57.43\\% \\]\n\nLooking at the example, their Gross Profit Margin was '18.80%', which is much lower, but their Gross Profit was much smaller relative to revenue. Our calculation seems correct.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -1,182,491.05\n- From the balance sheet:\n  - **Total Current Liabilities:** 499,821.72\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-1,182,491.05}{499,821.72} \\]\n\nCalculate the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-1,182,491.05}{499,821.72} \\approx -2.366 \\]\n\nSo, approximately -2.37.\n\nIn the example, their ratio was '-3.90', which is also negative, indicating that operating cash flow is negative relative to current liabilities.\n\n### Final Answer\nCombining all three:\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: ~0.03\n- Gross Profit Margin: ~57.43%\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: ~-2.37\n\nBut looking at the example's format, they presented Debt to Asset Ratio as '0.14' (two decimal places), Gross Profit Margin as '18.80%' (two decimal places with %), and Operating Cash Flow Ratio as '-3.90' (two decimal places).\n\nSo, let's present similarly:\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: '0.03'\n- Gross Profit Margin: '57.43%'\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: '-2.37'\n\nBut the example had one decimal for Debt to Asset, two for others. Maybe '0.0' for Debt to Asset? But 0.0336 is closer to 0.03 than 0.0. Maybe they rounded differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they did Total Liabilities / Total Assets where Total Liabilities is Total Liabilities and Equity minus Equity, which gives same as Total Current Liabilities here.\n\nGiven that, and since 0.0336 is closer to 0.03, let's go with two decimals for all for consistency.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Gross Profit Margin': '57.43%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.37'} }\n```\n\nBut the example had one decimal for Debt to Asset, so maybe '0.0'. But that seems too rounded. Alternatively, maybe '0.03' is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Debt to Asset is supposed to include all liabilities, which in this case is just current liabilities, so same as above.\n\nGiven that, and since the calculation seems correct, let's proceed with:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Gross Profit Margin': '57.43%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.37'} }\n```\n\nBut the example had '0.14', which is one decimal, so maybe '0.0'. But that seems inaccurate. Maybe the correct interpretation is to use Total Current Liabilities as Total Liabilities, which gives '0.03'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is supposed to be Total Debt / Total Assets, where Total Debt is just current liabilities here, so same.\n\nGiven that, and since 0.0336 is closer to 0.03 than 0.04, let's present as '0.03'.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Gross Profit Margin': '57.43%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.37'} }\n```",
