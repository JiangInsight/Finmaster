                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. We have three financial statements: the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement. We need to calculate three ratios:\n\n1. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio**\n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio**\n3. **Quick Ratio**\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how much cash flow is generated from operating activities relative to the net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,182,491.05\n- Net Profit = 1,390,936.99\n\nWait a minute, the net cash flow from operating activities is negative, and net profit is positive. That seems unusual because typically, if a company is profitable, you'd expect positive cash flow from operations unless there are significant non-cash items or changes in working capital that are consuming cash.\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-1,182,491.05}{1,390,936.99} \\approx -0.85 \\]\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the ratio was positive even when both numbers were negative (Net Profit was -1,645,141.43 and Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities was -7,259,994.10, giving a ratio of 4.41). \n\nHmm, maybe the ratio is the absolute value or perhaps the formula is Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities divided by Net Profit, considering the signs. \n\nGiven that in the example, -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 â‰ˆ 4.41, so same signs give positive ratio. Here, opposite signs give negative ratio. \n\nBut is a negative ratio meaningful? Maybe we take the absolute value or reconsider the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}} \\]\n\nBut that would be the inverse. \n\nGiven the example, it seems the formula is indeed Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit, and we keep the sign. \n\nSo here, it's -0.85. \n\nBut in the example, both were negative, resulting in a positive ratio. Here, one is negative, one is positive, so ratio is negative. \n\nMaybe the formula is absolute values? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is Operating Cash Flow / Net Income, where Operating Cash Flow is constructed from Net Income plus adjustments (depreciation, changes in working capital), which is what's given in the cash flow statement.\n\nGiven that, let's stick with:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} = \\frac{-1,182,491.05}{1,390,936.99} \\approx -0.85 \\]\n\nBut the example had a positive ratio when both were negative. Maybe the formula is the absolute value of the ratio. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Net Income}} \\]\n\nWhere Operating Cash Flow is Net Income + Depreciation + Changes in Working Capital, which is the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities.\n\nGiven that, and the example, it seems we divide the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities by Net Profit, keeping the sign.\n\nSo here: -0.85\n\nBut the example had both negative, giving positive. Here, one negative, one positive, giving negative. \n\nPerhaps the negative sign is acceptable, indicating that despite positive net income, operating cash flow is negative due to increases in working capital (like accounts receivable).\n\nSo, we'll proceed with -0.85.\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need Average Current Assets, which is the average of the beginning and ending current assets.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Current Assets (2023-12-31) = 8,000,000.00\n- End Current Assets (2024-02-05) = 9,982,261.98\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{8,000,000.00 + 9,982,261.98}{2} = \\frac{17,982,261.98}{2} = 8,991,130.99 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 3,956,433.90\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{3,956,433.90}{8,991,130.99} \\approx 0.44 \\]\n\n### 3. Quick Ratio\n\n**Definition:** Also known as the acid-test ratio, it measures a company's ability to meet short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nWhere Quick Assets = Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable (generally excludes inventory and other less liquid current assets).\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Cash on Hand = 2,103,508.95\n- Bank Deposits = 4,714,000.00\n- Interest Receivable = 15,414.09\n- Accounts Receivable = 3,149,338.94\n- Inventory = 0.00 (excluded as it's not quick)\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = 2,103,508.95 + 4,714,000.00 + 15,414.09 + 3,149,338.94 = 9,982,261.98 \\]\n\nWait, actually, looking at the balance sheet, Total Current Assets is 9,982,261.98, which includes all current assets. But quick assets exclude inventory, but here inventory is 0, so quick assets = total current assets = 9,982,261.98.\n\nCurrent Liabilities (end) = 499,821.72\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{9,982,261.98}{499,821.72} \\approx 19.97 \\]\n\nThis seems extremely high, which might indicate that the company has a lot of liquid assets relative to its current liabilities. \n\nBut let's double-check quick assets:\n\nQuick assets typically include:\n- Cash and cash equivalents (Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits)\n- Marketable securities (none here)\n- Accounts receivable\n- Sometimes interest receivable is included, but it's usually small.\n\nSo:\n\nCash and cash equivalents = 2,103,508.95 + 4,714,000.00 = 6,817,508.95\nAccounts receivable = 3,149,338.94\nInterest receivable = 15,414.09\n\nTotal quick assets = 6,817,508.95 + 3,149,338.94 + 15,414.09 = 9,982,261.98\n\nSame as total current assets because inventory is 0.\n\nSo quick ratio is indeed ~19.97.\n\nBut this seems unusually high. Maybe the current liabilities are understated or the company is very liquid.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter calculating all three ratios:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: -0.85\n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio: 0.44\n3. Quick Ratio: 19.97\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.85', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.44', 'Quick Ratio': '19.97'} }\n```",
