                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the four requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities here) = 499,821.72\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,390,936.99\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 499,821.72 / 14,390,936.99 ≈ 0.0347\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:**  \nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1,390,936.99\n- Total Revenue = 3,956,433.90\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (1,390,936.99 / 3,956,433.90) * 100 ≈ 35.16%\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:**  \nROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets = 14,890,758.71\n- Net Profit = 1,390,936.99\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (1,390,936.99 / 14,890,758.71) * 100 ≈ 9.34%\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since we don't have info on cash sales), Net Credit Sales = Total Revenue = 3,956,433.90\n\nFor Average Accounts Receivable:\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable (from initial balance sheet) = 0.00\n- Ending Accounts Receivable = 3,149,338.94\nAverage = (0 + 3,149,338.94) / 2 = 1,574,669.47\n\nCalculation:\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 3,956,433.90 / 1,574,669.47 ≈ 2.51\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Net Profit Margin': '35.16%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '9.34%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.51'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check each calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - 499,821.72 / 14,390,936.99 ≈ 0.0347 → \"0.03\" seems correct when rounded to two decimal places.\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - 1,390,936.99 / 3,956,433.90 ≈ 0.3516 → 35.16% is correct.\n\n3. **ROA:**\n   - 1,390,936.99 / 14,890,758.71 ≈ 0.0934 → 9.34% is correct.\n\n4. **Accounts Receivable Turnover:**\n   - Average AR is correct since beginning is 0.\n   - 3,956,433.90 / 1,574,669.47 ≈ 2.51 is correct.\n\nEverything checks out! The final JSON is accurate based on the provided data.",
