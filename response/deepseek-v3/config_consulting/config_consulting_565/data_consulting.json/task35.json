                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount): 9,982,261.98\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount): 499,821.72\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 9,982,261.98 / 499,821.72 ≈ 19.97\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n**Definition:** (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit: 2,272,433.90\n- Total Revenue: 3,956,433.90\n\nCalculation:\nGross Profit Margin = (2,272,433.90 / 3,956,433.90) * 100 ≈ 57.44%\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Definition:** Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities: This seems to be just the Total Current Liabilities since there are no non-current liabilities listed: 499,821.72\n- Total Assets: 14,890,758.71\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 499,821.72 / 14,890,758.71 ≈ 0.0336 or 3.36%\n\nWait a minute, in the example, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated using Total Current Liabilities as the debt, even though there might be other liabilities not listed. Here, it seems only current liabilities are present, so that's what we'll use.\n\n### 4. Net Profit Margin\n**Definition:** (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit: 1,390,936.99\n- Total Revenue: 3,956,433.90\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (1,390,936.99 / 3,956,433.90) * 100 ≈ 35.16%\n\n### 5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand: 2,103,508.95\n- Bank Deposits: 4,714,000.00\n- Total Cash and Equivalents: 2,103,508.95 + 4,714,000.00 = 6,817,508.95\n- Current Liabilities: 499,821.72\n\nCalculation:\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = 6,817,508.95 / 499,821.72 ≈ 13.64\n\n### 6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n**Definition:** Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -1,182,491.05\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (Capital Expenditures): 0.00\n\nCalculation:\nFCF = -1,182,491.05 - 0 = -1,182,491.05\n\nAlternatively, sometimes FCF is considered as the net increase in cash and equivalents, which is -1,182,491.05 (from \"Net Increase\" in cash flow statement). Both methods give the same result here.\n\n### 7. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Definition:** (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Profit: 1,390,936.99\n- Total Assets (End_amount): 14,890,758.71\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (1,390,936.99 / 14,890,758.71) * 100 ≈ 9.34%\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '19.97', 'Gross Profit Margin': '57.44%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '3.36%', 'Net Profit Margin': '35.16%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '13.64', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-1182491.05', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '9.34%'}}\n```\n\n### Verification:\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: 9,982,261.98 / 499,821.72 = 19.97 ✔\n2. **Gross Profit Margin**: 2,272,433.90 / 3,956,433.90 = 0.5744 → 57.44% ✔\n3. **Debt to Asset Ratio**: 499,821.72 / 14,890,758.71 ≈ 0.0336 → 3.36% ✔\n4. **Net Profit Margin**: 1,390,936.99 / 3,956,433.90 ≈ 0.3516 → 35.16% ✔\n5. **Cash to Current Debt Ratio**: (2,103,508.95 + 4,714,000) / 499,821.72 = 6,817,508.95 / 499,821.72 ≈ 13.64 ✔\n6. **FCF**: -1,182,491.05 (from operating activities, no investing activities other than 0 purchase) ✔\n7. **ROA**: 1,390,936.99 / 14,890,758.71 ≈ 0.0934 → 9.34% ✔\n\nEverything checks out!",
