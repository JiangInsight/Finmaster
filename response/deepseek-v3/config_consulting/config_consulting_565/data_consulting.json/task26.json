                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: Return on Equity (ROE), Debt to Asset Ratio, and Gross Profit Margin. \n\n### 1. Understanding the Ratios\n\n**a. Return on Equity (ROE):**\nThis measures how effectively a company is using its shareholders' equity to generate profits. The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Shareholders' Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n*Note:* Sometimes, the ending shareholders' equity is used if beginning figures aren't available or if the period is short.\n\n**b. Debt to Asset Ratio:**\nThis shows the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**c. Gross Profit Margin:**\nThis indicates the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\n### 2. Extracting Necessary Data from the Financial Statements\n\nLet's pull out the numbers we need from each statement.\n\n**a. Balance Sheet (as of 2024-02-05):**\n- Total Assets: 14,890,758.71\n- Total Current Liabilities: 499,821.72\n  - Accounts Payable: 302,000.00\n  - Taxes Payable: 197,821.72\n- Total Owner's Equity: 14,390,936.99\n  - Paid-in Capital: 13,000,000.00\n  - Retained Earnings: 1,390,936.99\n\n*Note:* There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 499,821.72.\n\n**b. Income Statement (for the period ending 2024-02-05):**\n- Total Revenue: 3,956,433.90\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 1,684,000.00\n- Gross Profit: 2,272,433.90\n- Net Profit: 1,390,936.99\n\n### 3. Calculating Each Ratio\n\n**a. Return on Equity (ROE):**\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Shareholders' Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{1,390,936.99}{14,390,936.99} \\times 100 \\]\nCalculating:\n\\[ \\frac{1,390,936.99}{14,390,936.99} \\approx 0.09665 \\]\n\\[ 0.09665 \\times 100 \\approx 9.665\\% \\]\nRounding to two decimal places: 9.67%\n\n*Note:* If we consider that the initial equity was 13,000,000 and ending is 14,390,936.99, the average would be (13,000,000 + 14,390,936.99)/2 = 13,695,468.495. Then ROE would be:\n\\[ \\frac{1,390,936.99}{13,695,468.495} \\times 100 \\approx 10.16\\% \\]\nHowever, since the example provided uses ending equity, we'll stick with that unless specified otherwise. But looking back at the example, it seems they used ending equity (Retained Earnings was negative, and they didn't average). So, we'll use ending equity here as well: 9.67%.\n\n**b. Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{499,821.72}{14,890,758.71} \\]\nCalculating:\n\\[ \\frac{499,821.72}{14,890,758.71} \\approx 0.03356 \\]\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.03\n\n*Wait a minute,* in the example, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated as Total Current Liabilities / Total Assets, which gave 0.14. Here, our Total Liabilities are only current liabilities (499,821.72), so the calculation is correct as 0.03. Maybe the example had more liabilities.\n\n**c. Gross Profit Margin:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{2,272,433.90}{3,956,433.90} \\times 100 \\]\nCalculating:\n\\[ \\frac{2,272,433.90}{3,956,433.90} \\approx 0.5743 \\]\n\\[ 0.5743 \\times 100 \\approx 57.43\\% \\]\n\n### 4. Verifying Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't miss anything.\n\n- **ROE:** Net Profit / Equity = 1,390,936.99 / 14,390,936.99 ≈ 9.67%\n- **Debt to Asset:** 499,821.72 / 14,890,758.71 ≈ 0.03\n- **Gross Profit Margin:** 2,272,433.90 / 3,956,433.90 ≈ 57.43%\n\nEverything seems to add up correctly.\n\n### 5. Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '9.67%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Gross Profit Margin': '57.43%'} }\n```\n\n*Additional Note:* If we were to use average equity for ROE, it would be approximately 10.16%, but based on the example provided, using ending equity seems to be the approach taken there, hence 9.67% is more consistent with the given example. However, both methods are valid, and the choice depends on the accounting practices followed. Given that the initial equity was 13,000,000 and ending is 14,390,936.99, averaging might be more precise, but since the example didn't average, we'll stick with ending equity for consistency. \n\nBut looking back at the example:\nInitial Equity: 13,000,000\nEnding Equity: 11,354,858.57\nNet Profit: -1,645,141.43\nROE in example: -1,645,141.43 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ -14.49%, but they had -13.51%. Maybe they used average equity:\nAverage Equity: (13,000,000 + 11,354,858.57)/2 = 12,177,429.285\nROE: -1,645,141.43 / 12,177,429.285 ≈ -13.51%, which matches their answer.\n\nSo, to be consistent with the example, we should use average equity.\n\nRecalculating ROE with average equity:\nInitial Equity: 13,000,000\nEnding Equity: 14,390,936.99\nAverage Equity: (13,000,000 + 14,390,936.99)/2 = 13,695,468.495\nROE: 1,390,936.99 / 13,695,468.495 ≈ 0.1016 or 10.16%\n\nUpdating the answer accordingly.\n\nFinal Corrected Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '10.16%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Gross Profit Margin': '57.43%'} }\n```",
