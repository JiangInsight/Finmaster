                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio one by one to understand how to compute them based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- **Total Liabilities:** This is the sum of all liabilities. In the given balance sheet, under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" we see:\n  - Accounts Payable: 302,000.00\n  - Taxes Payable: 197,821.72\n  - Total Current Liabilities: 499,821.72\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 499,821.72\n- **Total Assets:** At the end date (2024-02-05), Total Assets = 14,890,758.71\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{499,821.72}{14,890,758.71} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ \\frac{499,821.72}{14,890,758.71} \\approx 0.03356 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[ \\approx 0.03 \\]\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the ratio was given to two decimal places as well, so we'll present it similarly.\n\n**Debt to Asset Ratio:** '0.03'\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operating activities to the net income, indicating how much cash the company generates relative to its reported profits. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -1,182,491.05\n- **Net Income (Net Profit):** 1,390,936.99 (from the Income Statement)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-1,182,491.05}{1,390,936.99} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ \\frac{-1,182,491.05}{1,390,936.99} \\approx -0.8503 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[ \\approx -0.85 \\]\n\nThis negative ratio indicates that the operating cash flow is negative while net income is positive, which might suggest that although the company is reporting profits, it's not generating positive cash from its operations, possibly due to increases in working capital (like accounts receivable).\n\n**Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:** '-0.85'\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining both ratios, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.85'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify the numbers to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n   - Total Liabilities: Only current liabilities are present, totaling 499,821.72.\n   - Total Assets: 14,890,758.71.\n   - Ratio: 499,821.72 / 14,890,758.71 ≈ 0.03356 → '0.03' (correct).\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:**\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -1,182,491.05.\n   - Net Income: 1,390,936.99.\n   - Ratio: -1,182,491.05 / 1,390,936.99 ≈ -0.8503 → '-0.85' (correct).\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Additional Observations\n\nIt's interesting to note that despite having a positive net income, the company's operating cash flow is negative. This is primarily due to significant increases in accounts receivable (-3,149,338.94), meaning the company has made sales on credit, increasing receivables but not yet collecting the cash. This is a common scenario where profits don't immediately translate to cash inflows.\n\nThe debt to asset ratio is very low (0.03), indicating that the company is primarily financed by equity rather than debt, which is generally a sign of lower financial risk.",
