This account typically represents the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares.\n\n2. **Extract the initial value**: The initial value is the amount under \"Initial_amount\" for the \"Paid-in Capital\" line item. In this case, it is '13000000.00'.\n\n3. **Extract the end value**: The end value is the amount under \"End_amount\" for the \"Paid-in Capital\" line item. Here, it is also '13000000.00'.\n\n4. **Verify**: Both the initial and end values for \"Paid-in Capital\" are the same, indicating no change in the capital contributed by shareholders during the period.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
