The end value is the amount owed at the end of the period.\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is typically found in the **Income Statement** under \"Financial Expenses\". This represents the costs associated with borrowing funds.\n3. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is typically found in the **Cash Flow Statement** under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" within the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section. This represents the cash outflow for acquiring long-term assets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**:\n   - Look for \"Accounts Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet.\n   - The end value for \"Accounts Receivable\" is **3149338.94**.\n\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - Look for \"Financial Expenses\" in the Income Statement.\n   - The value for \"Financial Expenses\" is **81394.22**.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - Look for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n   - The value for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is **0.00**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3149338.94', 'value2': '81394.22', 'value3': '0.00'} }\n```",
