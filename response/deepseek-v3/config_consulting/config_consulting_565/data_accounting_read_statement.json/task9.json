The relevant line item is \"Taxes Payable,\" which represents taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Line Item**: Look for the \"Taxes Payable\" account in the balance sheet. This account typically represents taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**: The initial value of \"Taxes Payable\" is the amount listed under \"Initial_amount\" for the \"Taxes Payable\" line. In the given problem, this value is \"0.00\" as of the \"Initial_date\" \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**: The end value of \"Taxes Payable\" is the amount listed under \"End_amount\" for the \"Taxes Payable\" line. In the given problem, this value is \"197821.72\" as of the \"End_date\" \"2024-02-05\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '197821.72'} }\n```",
