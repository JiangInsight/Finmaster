This is typically reflected in the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" line item under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are looking for the increase in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit. This is captured by the \"Accounts Payable\" line item in the cash flow statement. An increase in accounts payable means the entity owes more for goods or services purchased on credit during the period.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is present under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section. The amount associated with this line item is \"302000.00\".\n\n3. **Verify the Context**: The value is positive, indicating an increase in accounts payable, which aligns with the task's requirement of identifying the addition in the amount owed.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value to be extracted is \"302000.00\".\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '302000.00'} }\n```",
