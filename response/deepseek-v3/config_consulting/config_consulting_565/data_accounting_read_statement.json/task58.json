This is typically found in the balance sheet or the cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Reviewing the Balance Sheet**: \n   - The balance sheet provides \"Initial_amount\" for \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" at the \"Initial_date\" (2023-12-31).\n   - \"Cash on Hand\" initial amount: 3,000,000.00\n   - \"Bank Deposits\" initial amount: 5,000,000.00\n   - The sum of these two line items is 8,000,000.00, which matches the \"Total Current Assets\" initial amount. This suggests that \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" at the beginning of the period is the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\".\n\n3. **Reviewing the Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - The cash flow statement explicitly lists \"Beginning Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" as 8,000,000.00, which matches the sum from the balance sheet.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The value of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period is 8,000,000.00, as confirmed by both the balance sheet and the cash flow statement.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
