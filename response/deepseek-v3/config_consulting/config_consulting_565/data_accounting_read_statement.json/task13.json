These assets are typically classified as non-current assets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding Non-Current Assets**: Non-current assets are long-term assets that are not expected to be converted into cash or used up within one year or the normal operating cycle of the business. Examples include fixed assets, intangible assets, and long-term investments.\n\n2. **Identifying Non-Current Assets in the Problem**: \n   - In the given problem, the line items under non-current assets are:\n     - Fixed Assets\n     - Accumulated Depreciation\n     - Total Non-current Assets\n\n3. **Extracting Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The initial value of non-current assets is given under \"Total Non-current Assets\" at the initial date (2023-12-31), which is `5000000.00`.\n   - **End Value**: The end value of non-current assets is given under \"Total Non-current Assets\" at the end date (2024-02-05), which is `4908496.73`.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - The initial and end values of \"Total Non-current Assets\" are consistent with the values of \"Fixed Assets\" minus \"Accumulated Depreciation\":\n     - Initial: `5000000.00 (Fixed Assets) - 0.00 (Accumulated Depreciation) = 5000000.00`\n     - End: `5000000.00 (Fixed Assets) - 91503.27 (Accumulated Depreciation) = 4908496.73`\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '4908496.73'} }\n```",
