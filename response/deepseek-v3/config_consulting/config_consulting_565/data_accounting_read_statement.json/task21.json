In an income statement, this is typically represented by \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Operating Revenue,\" as it reflects the income from the entity's main business operations.\n2. **Identify the Line Item**: In the given problem, the line item \"Main Business Revenue\" clearly represents the income from core operating activities.\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Main Business Revenue\" is \"3956433.90\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3956433.90'}}\n```",
