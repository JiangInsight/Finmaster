This account represents interest that has been earned but not yet received. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Value**: \n   - In the balance sheet, under the \"Interest Receivable\" account, the \"Initial_amount\" is listed as \"0.00\" with the \"Initial_date\" of \"2023-12-31\". \n   - Therefore, the initial value is \"0.00\".\n\n2. **End Value**: \n   - In the same \"Interest Receivable\" account, the \"End_amount\" is listed as \"15414.09\" with the \"End_date\" of \"2024-02-05\". \n   - Therefore, the end value is \"15414.09\".\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '15414.09'} }\n```",
