These items are typically categorized as \"Fixed Assets\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: \n   - The balance sheet includes a line item labeled \"Fixed Assets,\" which represents tangible assets used in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes.\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item is related to Fixed Assets but represents the depreciation over time, not the tangible asset itself.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Fixed Assets\" line shows an initial value of `5000000.00` as of `2023-12-31`.\n   - The end value for \"Fixed Assets\" is `5000000.00` as of `2024-02-05`. Note that the value has not changed, but the \"Accumulated Depreciation\" has increased, which affects the net book value of the fixed assets (shown under \"Total Non-current Assets\").\n\n3. **Verify Tangible Nature**:\n   - Fixed Assets are explicitly tangible items used for the purposes described in the task (production, supply, rental, or administration).\n\n4. **Exclude Other Items**:\n   - Other line items like \"Cash on Hand,\" \"Bank Deposits,\" \"Inventory,\" etc., are either not tangible or not held for the specified purposes.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe initial and end values for the tangible fixed assets are as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5000000.00'} }\n```",
