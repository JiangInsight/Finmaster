                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement extraction task step by step. I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we need.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific pieces of information from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under \"Paid-in Capital\" or similar.\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is usually the \"Profit Before Tax\" line in the Income Statement.\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This refers to the increase in \"Accounts Payable\" during the period, which can be found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n\nThe order to present these is: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\nLooking at the Balance Sheet section, we're interested in \"Paid-in Capital\":\n```\nPaid-in Capital | 13000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 13000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThis shows that the capital contributed by shareholders is `13000000.00` at both the start and end of the period. Since it's the same, no new capital was added during this period, but the initial capital is `13000000.00`.\n\n**Value1: 13000000.00**\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\nNow, let's look at the Income Statement for \"Profit Before Tax\":\n```\nProfit Before Tax | 1588758.71 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThis is the profit before tax expense is deducted.\n\n**Value2: 1588758.71**\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nNext, we need the increase in \"Accounts Payable\" during the period. In the Cash Flow Statement:\n```\nIncrease (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 302000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThis indicates that the amount owed by the entity for goods/services on credit increased by `302000.00` during the period.\n\n**Value3: 302000.00**\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nLooking back at the provided example to ensure I'm doing this correctly:\n- Their `value1` was '13000000.00' (Paid-in Capital from Balance Sheet)\n- `value2` was '-1373590.51' (Profit Before Tax from Income Statement)\n- `value3` was '1590000.00' (Increase in Accounts Payable from Cash Flow)\n\nThis matches my approach, so I'm on the right track.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1588758.71', 'value3': '302000.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. **Balance Sheet**: Located \"Paid-in Capital\" which represents capital contributed by shareholders. Found it constant at `13000000.00`.\n2. **Income Statement**: Found \"Profit Before Tax\" as `1588758.71`, which is the profit before tax expense.\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**: Identified the increase in \"Accounts Payable\" as `302000.00`, showing the addition in amounts owed on credit.\n4. Verified the approach with the given example to ensure correctness.\n5. Compiled the values in the specified order and format.\n\nThis method ensures that all required line items are accurately extracted and presented in the correct sequence.",
