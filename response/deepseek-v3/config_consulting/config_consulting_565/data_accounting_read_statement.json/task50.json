I'm going to break down the task to understand what each of the four values we need to extract represents, and then locate them in the given cash flow statement.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task asks us to identify and extract four specific line items from the cash flow statement based on their descriptions. Here's what each of the four values corresponds to:\n\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is the **Depreciation** expense.\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period**: This refers to the change in **Inventory**.\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends**: This is the **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**.\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is the **Net Increase** in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nNow, let's find each of these in the provided cash flow statement.\n\n### Analyzing the Cash Flow Statement\n\nHere's the cash flow statement we're working with:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit  | 1390936.99 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation  | 91503.27 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -3149338.94 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -15414.09 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 302000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 197821.72 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -1182491.05 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Ending Balance  | 6817508.95 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Increase  | -1182491.05 | 2024-02-05 |\n\n### Extracting the Required Values\n\n1. **Depreciation**: \n   - Line item: \"Depreciation\"\n   - Amount: 91503.27\n   - So, `value1 = '91503.27'`\n\n2. **Change in Inventory**:\n   - Line item: \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\"\n   - Amount: -0.00 (which is effectively 0, but we'll keep the sign as given)\n   - So, `value2 = '-0.00'`\n\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - Line item: \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\"\n   - Amount: -0.00\n   - So, `value3 = '-0.00'`\n\n4. **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n   - Line item: \"Net Increase\"\n   - Amount: -1182491.05\n   - So, `value4 = '-1182491.05'`\n\n### Verifying the Order\n\nThe task mentions that for multiple outputs, we should maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement. Looking at the statement:\n\n- Depreciation appears first.\n- Then (Increase) Decrease in Inventory.\n- Then Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\n- Finally, Net Increase.\n\nSo, the order we've assigned (`value1` to `value4`) matches the sequence in the statement.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91503.27', 'value2': '-0.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '-1182491.05'}}\n```\n\n### Cross-Checking with the Example\n\nLooking back at the provided example to ensure consistency:\n\n- Their `value1` was Depreciation: '45751.41' (matches our `value1`)\n- `value2` was (Increase) Decrease in Inventory: '-5090000.00' (matches our `value2`)\n- `value3` was Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: '-305354.43' (matches our `value3`)\n- `value4` was Net Increase: '-7565348.53' (matches our `value4`)\n\nOur approach aligns perfectly with the example, confirming that we're on the right track.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully identifying each required line item and ensuring the order matches the statement's sequence, the final extracted values are correctly placed in the JSON solution.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91503.27', 'value2': '-0.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '-1182491.05'}}\n```",
