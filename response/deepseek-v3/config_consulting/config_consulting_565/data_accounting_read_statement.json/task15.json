Here are the steps to extract the required information:\n\n1. **Identify the Initial Value of Equity**: \n   - Look for the \"Initial_amount\" under the \"Total Owner's Equity\" line item.\n   - In the given problem, the \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Owner's Equity\" is \"13000000.00\".\n\n2. **Identify the End Value of Equity**:\n   - Look for the \"End_amount\" under the \"Total Owner's Equity\" line item.\n   - In the given problem, the \"End_amount\" for \"Total Owner's Equity\" is \"14390936.99\".\n\n3. **Construct the Solution**:\n   - The initial value of equity is \"13000000.00\".\n   - The end value of equity is \"14390936.99\".\n\nThus, the solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '14390936.99'} }\n```",
