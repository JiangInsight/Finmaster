This typically falls under \"Selling Expenses\" in the Income Statement.\n     - **Value2:** Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets. This is typically found under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\n2. **Extracting Value1 (Selling Expenses):**\n   - From the **Income Statement**, look for \"Selling Expenses.\"\n   - In the given problem, the Income Statement has:\n     ```\n     | Selling Expenses | 360961.15 | 2024-02-05 |\n     ```\n   - Therefore, **Value1 = '360961.15'**.\n\n3. **Extracting Value2 (Purchase of Fixed Assets):**\n   - From the **Cash Flow Statement**, look for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n   - In the given problem, the Cash Flow Statement has:\n     ```\n     | Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n     ```\n   - Therefore, **Value2 = '0.00'**.\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   - The two values are:\n     - Value1 (Selling Expenses): '360961.15'\n     - Value2 (Purchase of Fixed Assets): '0.00'\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '360961.15', 'value2': '0.00'}}\n```",
