Typically, expenses in the balance sheet can be inferred from items like \"Accumulated Depreciation\" which represents the total depreciation expense accumulated over time.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is directly related to depreciation expense, which is a type of expense in the profit or loss statement.\n\n3. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The initial amount for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is `0.00` as of `2023-12-31`.\n   - **End Value**: The end amount for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is `91503.27` as of `2024-02-05`.\n\n4. **Verify**: The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is the only expense-related line item in the balance sheet provided. Other items like \"Taxes Payable\" are liabilities, not expenses directly listed in the profit or loss statement.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '91503.27'} }\n```",
