This is typically labeled as \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are to find the line item that shows money owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit. This is \"Accounts Receivable\" in accounting terms.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided balance sheet, look for the row labeled \"Accounts Receivable\".\n\n3. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Accounts Receivable\" is the value at the \"Initial_date\".\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Accounts Receivable\" is the value at the \"End_date\".\n\n4. **From the Given Problem**:\n   - \"Accounts Receivable\" has:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00 (Initial_date: 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: 3149338.94 (End_date: 2024-02-05)\n\n5. **Construct the Solution**:\n   - The initial value is '0.00'.\n   - The end value is '3149338.94'.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3149338.94'} }\n```",
