                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the correct answers.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task is to identify and extract two specific line items from an income statement:\n\n1. **Income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities**\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**\n\nFrom the examples given, it seems that:\n\n- The \"income arising from core operating activities\" corresponds to \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n- The \"carrying amount of inventories sold\" corresponds to \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\nThis makes sense because:\n\n- \"Main Business Revenue\" is the income generated from the primary operations of the business.\n- \"Cost of Goods Sold\" represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company, which includes the carrying amount of inventories sold.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nNow, let's look at the income statement provided in the problem:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 3956433.90 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Revenue | 3956433.90 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 1684000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Cost | 1684000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Gross Profit | 2272433.90 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 165230.64 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Selling Expenses | 360961.15 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation | 91503.27 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Financial Expenses | 81394.22 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Expenses | 699089.28 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Interest Income | 15414.09 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 1588758.71 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Tax Expense | 197821.72 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit | 1390936.99 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nFrom this, we can see:\n\n- **Main Business Revenue**: 3,956,433.90\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: 1,684,000.00\n\nThese are the two line items we're interested in, based on the definitions and the example.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the example provided:\n\n```json\n{\"problem\": | Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 5431018.59 | 2024-01-30 |\n...\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 4410000.00 | 2024-01-30 |\n...}\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5431018.59', 'value2': '4410000.00'}}\n```\n\nHere, 'value1' is the \"Main Business Revenue\" and 'value2' is the \"Cost of Goods Sold.\" This confirms our understanding.\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nApplying this to the current problem:\n\n- 'value1' (Main Business Revenue): 3,956,433.90\n- 'value2' (Cost of Goods Sold): 1,684,000.00\n\n### Potential Confusions\n\nInitially, one might wonder if \"Total Revenue\" could be considered as the income from core operations. However, in the given statement, \"Total Revenue\" is the same as \"Main Business Revenue,\" suggesting that there are no other revenue streams like \"Other Income\" or \"Non-operating Revenue.\" Therefore, \"Main Business Revenue\" is the appropriate line item.\n\nSimilarly, \"Total Cost\" is the same as \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" indicating that all costs are directly related to the goods sold, with no additional cost categories listed separately.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the income statement and comparing it with the provided example, the two required values are clearly:\n\n1. Main Business Revenue: 3,956,433.90\n2. Cost of Goods Sold: 1,684,000.00\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3956433.90', 'value2': '1684000.00'}}\n```",
