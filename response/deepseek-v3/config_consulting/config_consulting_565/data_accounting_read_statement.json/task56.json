This is typically represented by the \"Depreciation\" line item in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Task**: The task asks for the value of depreciation, which is the systematic allocation of the cost of an asset over its useful life. This value can be found in the financial statements.\n\n2. **Locating Depreciation in Financial Statements**:\n   - **Balance Sheet**: The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item shows the total depreciation accumulated over time. The change in this value from the initial to the end date represents the depreciation for the period. Here, it changes from 0.00 to 91503.27.\n   - **Cash Flow Statement**: The \"Depreciation\" line item under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" directly shows the depreciation amount for the period, which is 91503.27.\n   - **Income Statement**: The \"Depreciation\" line item under expenses also shows the depreciation amount for the period, which is 91503.27.\n\n3. **Verification**: All three sections (balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) consistently report the same depreciation value of 91503.27 for the period ending 2024-02-05.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The value to be extracted is 91503.27.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91503.27'} }\n```",
