                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the solution.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe're given a cash flow statement, and we need to:\n\n1. **Identify and extract the specific line item and value of \"net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period.\"**\n   \n   - This seems to refer to the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents, which shows how much the cash balance changed during the period.\n\n2. **Decompose this \"Net Increase\" into 2 component sub-items that also come from the cash flow statement.**\n   \n   - Typically, the net increase in cash is calculated by looking at the beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents. So, the two sub-items would likely be the \"Beginning Balance\" and the \"Ending Balance.\"\n\n3. **Output the final value of the net increase and the two sub-items.**\n\n### Looking at the Given Problem\n\nHere's the cash flow statement provided:\n\n```\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit  | 1390936.99 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation  | 91503.27 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -3149338.94 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -15414.09 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 302000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 197821.72 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -1182491.05 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Ending Balance  | 6817508.95 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Increase  | -1182491.05 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\n\n### Identifying the Required Items\n\n1. **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents:**\n   \n   - From the table, the line \"Net Increase\" shows \"-1182491.05\". This is the net change in cash during the period.\n\n2. **Sub-items for Net Increase:**\n   \n   - The net increase is typically calculated as:\n     - Ending Balance - Beginning Balance = Net Increase\n   - So, the two sub-items are:\n     - Beginning Balance: \"8000000.00\"\n     - Ending Balance: \"6817508.95\"\n   \n   - Let's verify:\n     - 6,817,508.95 (Ending) - 8,000,000.00 (Beginning) = -1,182,491.05 (Net Increase)\n     - This matches the given \"Net Increase\" value.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example:\n\n- Net Increase: \"-7565348.53\"\n- Sub-items:\n  - sub_item value1: \"8000000.00\" (Beginning Balance)\n  - sub_item value2: \"434651.47\" (Ending Balance)\n  \nCalculation:\n- 434,651.47 - 8,000,000.00 = -7,565,348.53 (matches Net Increase)\n\nThis confirms our approach is correct.\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nFor our problem:\n\n- **value (Net Increase):** \"-1182491.05\"\n- **sub_items:**\n  - sub_item value1 (Beginning Balance): \"8000000.00\"\n  - sub_item value2 (Ending Balance): \"6817508.95\"\n\n### Formatting the Answer in JSON\n\nThe required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '______', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '______', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '______'} }\n```\n\nFilling in the values:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1182491.05', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '6817508.95'} }\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1182491.05', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '6817508.95'} }\n```",
