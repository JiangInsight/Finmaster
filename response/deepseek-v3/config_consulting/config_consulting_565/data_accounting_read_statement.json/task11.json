Retained earnings represent the cumulative amount of profit or loss that has been retained in the entity rather than being distributed to shareholders.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Line Item**: Look for the account labeled \"Retained Earnings\" in the balance sheet.\n   \n2. **Extract Initial Value**: The initial value of retained earnings is provided under the \"Initial_amount\" column for the \"Retained Earnings\" account.\n   - In the given problem, the initial value is `0.00` as of the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**: The end value of retained earnings is provided under the \"End_amount\" column for the \"Retained Earnings\" account.\n   - In the given problem, the end value is `1390936.99` as of the end date `2024-02-05`.\n\n4. **Verify**: Ensure that the values are correctly extracted from the \"Retained Earnings\" line and not from any other account.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1390936.99'} }\n```",
