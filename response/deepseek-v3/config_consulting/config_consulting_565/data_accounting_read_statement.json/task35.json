                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through the income statement provided and identify the four specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract four specific line items from the income statement:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**: This typically refers to \"Selling Expenses\" because these are costs related to marketing, selling, and distributing products or services.\n   \n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually labeled as \"Financial Expenses\" in the income statement, which includes interest expenses and other costs related to borrowing money.\n\n3. **The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is \"Depreciation,\" which represents the allocation of the cost of tangible assets over their useful lives.\n\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period**: This is the \"Tax Expense,\" which shows the taxes owed based on the taxable income.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Income Statement\nHere's the income statement we're working with:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 3956433.90 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Revenue | 3956433.90 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 1684000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Cost | 1684000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Gross Profit | 2272433.90 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 165230.64 | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Selling Expenses** | 360961.15 | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Depreciation** | 91503.27 | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Financial Expenses** | 81394.22 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Expenses | 699089.28 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Interest Income | 15414.09 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 1588758.71 | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Tax Expense** | 197821.72 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit | 1390936.99 | 2024-02-05 |\n\n### Identifying the Required Line Items\nNow, let's pick out the four items:\n\n1. **Selling Expenses**: This is directly listed as \"Selling Expenses\" with an amount of `360961.15`.\n   \n2. **Depreciation**: Listed as \"Depreciation\" with an amount of `91503.27`.\n   \n3. **Financial Expenses**: Listed as \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of `81394.22`.\n   \n4. **Tax Expense**: Listed as \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of `197821.72`.\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe example provided shows that the order of the values in the solution corresponds to the order in which these line items appear in the income statement. Looking at the table:\n\n- Selling Expenses comes first.\n- Then Depreciation.\n- Followed by Financial Expenses.\n- And finally, Tax Expense.\n\nSo, the order is correct as per the table's sequence.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '360961.15', 'value2': '91503.27', 'value3': '81394.22', 'value4': '197821.72'} }\n```\n\n### Double-Checking\nJust to ensure I didn't miss anything:\n\n- **Value1 (Selling Expenses)**: 360961.15 — Correct.\n- **Value2 (Depreciation)**: 91503.27 — Correct.\n- **Value3 (Financial Expenses)**: 81394.22 — Correct.\n- **Value4 (Tax Expense)**: 197821.72 — Correct.\n\nEverything checks out! \n\n### Conclusion\nBy carefully reading the income statement and matching each required item to its corresponding line, we've successfully extracted the necessary values in the correct order.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '360961.15', 'value2': '91503.27', 'value3': '81394.22', 'value4': '197821.72'} }\n```",
