This line item is typically labeled as \"Depreciation\" in the income statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task asks for the value of the accumulated systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. This is the definition of depreciation.\n2. **Review the Income Statement**: Look through the provided income statement to find the line item labeled \"Depreciation\".\n3. **Locate the Depreciation Value**: In the given income statement, the \"Depreciation\" line item is present with an amount of \"91503.27\".\n4. **Verify the Context**: Ensure that the \"Depreciation\" line item matches the description of the task (i.e., it represents the allocation of an asset's cost over its useful life).\n5. **Extract the Value**: The value to be extracted is \"91503.27\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91503.27'}}\n```",
