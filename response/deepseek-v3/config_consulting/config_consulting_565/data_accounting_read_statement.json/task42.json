This is typically found under the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section of the cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Section**: In the provided cash flow statement, the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section contains the line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which represents cash payments to acquire PP&E and other long-term assets.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is `0.00` in the given problem.\n\n4. **Verify the Value**: The value is confirmed by checking the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" which is also `-0.00`, indicating no cash outflow for investing activities other than the purchase of fixed assets (which is zero in this case).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'}}\n```",
