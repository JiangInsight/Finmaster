In an income statement, this is typically labeled as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS). COGS represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, including the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the goods.\n\n2. **Review the Given Income Statement**: Look through the provided income statement to locate the line item that matches \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n\n3. **Identify the Line Item**: In the given income statement, the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is present with an amount of \"1684000.00\" and a date of \"2024-02-05\".\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is \"1684000.00\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1684000.00'}}\n```",
