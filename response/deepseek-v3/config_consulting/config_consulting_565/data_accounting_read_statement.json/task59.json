This represents the interest accrued but not yet received.\n\n2. **Identify \"Net Increase\" in Cash and Cash Equivalents in the Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - In the Cash Flow Statement provided, under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, the \"Net Increase\" line item shows an \"Amount\" of \"-1182491.05\". This represents the net addition (or in this case, reduction) in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\n3. **Group the values by financial statement order**:\n   - The Balance Sheet comes first, so \"Interest Receivable\" (value1) is listed first.\n   - The Cash Flow Statement comes third, but since there is no relevant line item in the Income Statement, we proceed directly to the Cash Flow Statement for value2.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '15414.09', 'value2': '-1182491.05'}}\n```",
