This is typically labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, we can see the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an amount of \"197821.72\" dated \"2024-02-05\".\n\n3. **Verify the Context**: This line item is indeed under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, which is the correct section for such items. The value represents an increase in tax payable, meaning taxes have been accrued but not yet paid.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" is \"197821.72\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '197821.72'} }\n```",
