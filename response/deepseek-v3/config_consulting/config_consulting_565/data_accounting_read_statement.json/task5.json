These assets are typically categorized under \"Inventory\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The balance sheet includes a line item labeled \"Inventory,\" which represents goods held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for sale, or in the process of being manufactured.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Amount**: The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Inventory\" is listed as \"0.00\" with the \"Initial_date\" of \"2023-12-31\".\n   - **End Amount**: The \"End_amount\" for \"Inventory\" is listed as \"0.00\" with the \"End_date\" of \"2024-02-05\".\n\n3. **Verify the Line Item**:\n   - The \"Inventory\" line item is the only one that fits the description of assets held for sale or in production for sale. Other line items like \"Cash on Hand,\" \"Bank Deposits,\" etc., do not qualify as they are not directly related to goods for sale or production.\n\n4. **Final Values**:\n   - The initial value of \"Inventory\" is \"0.00\".\n   - The end value of \"Inventory\" is \"0.00\".\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '0.00'} }\n```",
