I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe're given a cash flow statement with various line items under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities.\" The task is to:\n\n1. **Identify and extract the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities.** This is essentially the \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" line in the statement.\n2. **Decompose this net amount into 7 component sub-items.** These sub-items are the individual line items that contribute to the calculation of the net cash flow from operating activities.\n3. **For each sub-item, provide its final value** as listed in the statement.\n\n### Given Data\n\nHere's the provided cash flow statement (simplified for clarity):\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit  | 1390936.99 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation  | 91503.27 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -3149338.94 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -15414.09 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 302000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 197821.72 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -1182491.05 | 2024-02-05 |\n| ... (other sections like Investing and Financing Activities) ... |\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\nFrom the table, the line \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" has the amount `-1182491.05`. This is the main value we're interested in.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the 7 Sub-items Contributing to This Net Amount\n\nLooking at the structure, the net cash flow from operating activities is calculated by summing up several adjustments to the net profit. These adjustments are the sub-items we need to list. Typically, these include:\n\n1. Net Profit\n2. Depreciation\n3. Changes in Accounts Receivable\n4. Changes in Interest Receivable\n5. Changes in Inventory\n6. Changes in Accounts Payable\n7. Changes in Tax Payable\n\nThese correspond to the lines in the table right before the \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" line.\n\n### Step 3: Extract the Values for Each Sub-item\n\nNow, let's list each sub-item with its corresponding value from the table:\n\n1. **Net Profit**: `1390936.99`\n2. **Depreciation**: `91503.27`\n3. **(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable**: `-3149338.94`\n4. **(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable**: `-15414.09`\n5. **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**: `-0.00`\n6. **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: `302000.00`\n7. **Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable**: `197821.72`\n\n### Verification\n\nTo ensure these are correct, let's sum them up to see if we get the net cash flow from operating activities:\n\n- Net Profit: `1390936.99`\n- Depreciation: `+ 91503.27` → `1482440.26`\n- Accounts Receivable: `- 3149338.94` → `-1656898.68`\n- Interest Receivable: `- 15414.09` → `-1672312.77`\n- Inventory: `- 0.00` → `-1672312.77`\n- Accounts Payable: `+ 302000.00` → `-1370312.77`\n- Tax Payable: `+ 197821.72` → `-1172491.05`\n\nHmm, this sums to `-1172491.05`, but the given net cash flow is `-1182491.05`. There's a discrepancy of `10000`. \n\nLooking back, the inventory is `-0.00`, which is zero, so that shouldn't affect it. Maybe I missed something. \n\nWait, the given net cash flow is `-1182491.05`, and our sum is `-1172491.05`. That's exactly `10000` less. \n\nIs there another adjustment? The table seems complete with these 7 items. Maybe a typo in the provided net cash flow? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inventory isn't exactly zero but a very small negative number displayed as `-0.00`. But even then, it's unlikely to account for `10000`.\n\nGiven that the example in the task also sums up to the net cash flow exactly, and here it's off by `10000`, it's possible there's an error in the provided data. \n\nBut since the task is to extract the given values, we'll proceed with the values as listed, assuming the net cash flow is correctly given as `-1182491.05` and the sub-items are as listed, even if they don't sum perfectly due to possible rounding or an unlisted minor adjustment.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the given data, here's the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-1182491.05\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value1\": \"1390936.99\", \"sub_item value2\": \"91503.27\", \"sub_item value3\": \"-3149338.94\", \"sub_item value4\": \"-15414.09\", \"sub_item value5\": \"-0.00\", \"sub_item value6\": \"302000.00\", \"sub_item value7\": \"197821.72\"}}}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Discrepancy\n\nJust to note, the sum of the sub-items is:\n\n`1390936.99 + 91503.27 - 3149338.94 - 15414.09 - 0.00 + 302000.00 + 197821.72 = -1172491.05`\n\nBut the given \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" is `-1182491.05`. There's a `10000` difference that isn't accounted for in the provided sub-items. This could be due to:\n\n1. An unlisted minor adjustment in the actual statement.\n2. A typo in the provided net cash flow value.\n3. Rounding differences where some numbers are displayed rounded but used in calculation with more precision.\n\nSince the task is to extract the given values, we present them as is, acknowledging this minor inconsistency. In a real-world scenario, we'd double-check the statement for any missing adjustments.",
