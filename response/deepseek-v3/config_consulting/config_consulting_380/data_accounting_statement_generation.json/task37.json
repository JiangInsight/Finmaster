Between these two, \"Depreciation20240201002\" is the more recent entry (dated February 1, 2024, compared to January 1, 2024).\n\nTherefore, the final depreciation item in the cash flow statement is \"47117.43\".\n\nHere's the solution in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '47117.43'}}\n```",
