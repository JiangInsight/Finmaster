Revenue from Sales\nWe need to sum all the `profit` amounts from the `Sale` transactions.

Calculating Profit Before Tax\nThe formula for Profit Before Tax is:\n\\[ \\text{Profit Before Tax} = \\text{Revenue from Sales} - \\text{Expenses} - \\text{Depreciation} + \\text{Interest Income} \\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\\[ \\text{Profit Before Tax} = 1,552,150.98 - 598,876.47 - 92,870.67 + 13,362.36 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Profit Before Tax} = 1,552,150.98 - 691,747.14 + 13,362.36 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Profit Before Tax} = 860,403.84 + 13,362.36 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Profit Before Tax} = 873,766.20 \\]\n\nHowever, this seems too high compared to the example provided. Let me recheck the calculations.\n\nUpon rechecking, I realize that the `profit` field in the `Sale` transactions is already the net of cost, so we don't need to subtract the cost again. The correct approach is to sum all `profit` from sales, subtract all expenses and depreciation, and add interest income.\n\nBut in the example, the Profit Before Tax was negative, which suggests that expenses and depreciation might outweigh the profits from sales and interest income. \n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nTotal Profit from Sales: 1,552,150.98  \nTotal Expenses: 598,876.47  \nTotal Depreciation: 92,870.67  \nTotal Interest Income: 13,362.36  \n\nProfit Before Tax = (1,552,150.98 - 598,876.47 - 92,870.67) + 13,362.36  \n= (1,552,150.98 - 691,747.14) + 13,362.36  \n= 860,403.84 + 13,362.36  \n= 873,766.20  \n\nThis still seems positive. Perhaps the issue is that some transactions are not correctly accounted for. Alternatively, the initial deposits and fixed assets might not be part of the income statement.\n\nGiven the complexity, I will proceed with the calculation as above.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Profit Before Tax': '873766.20'}}\n```",
