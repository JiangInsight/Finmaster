Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Purchase Transactions\nWe look for all transactions where the type is \"Purchase\" (initial inventory purchases). These represent increases in inventory.\n\nFrom the data, the purchase transactions are:\n1. Purchase20231231001: $10,000 (2 units of Standard Consulting at $5,000/unit)\n2. Purchase20231231002: $10,000 (2 units of Standard Consulting at $5,000/unit)\n3. Purchase20231231003: $1,000 (1 unit of Basic Consulting at $1,000/unit)\n4. Purchase20231231004: $40,000 (2 units of Premium Consulting at $20,000/unit)\n5. Purchase20231231005: $5,000 (1 unit of Standard Consulting at $5,000/unit)\n6. Purchase20231231006: $40,000 (2 units of Premium Consulting at $20,000/unit)\n7. Purchase20231231007: $15,000 (3 units of Standard Consulting at $5,000/unit)\n8. Purchase20231231008: $200,000 (2 units of Enterprise Solution at $100,000/unit)\n9. Purchase20231231009: $20,000 (1 unit of Premium Consulting at $20,000/unit)\n10. Purchase20231231010: $20,000 (1 unit of Premium Consulting at $20,000/unit)\n11. Purchase20231231011: $300,000 (3 units of Enterprise Solution at $100,000/unit)\n12.

Purchase20231231016: $40,000 (2 units of Premium Consulting at $20,000/unit)\n17. Purchase20231231017: $2,000 (2 units of Basic Consulting at $1,000/unit)\n18. Purchase20231231018: $100,000 (1 unit of Enterprise Solution at $100,000/unit)\n19. Purchase20231231019: $20,000 (1 unit of Premium Consulting at $20,000/unit)\n20.

Purchase20231231022: $5,000 (1 unit of Standard Consulting at $5,000/unit)\n23. Purchase20231231023: $3,000 (3 units of Basic Consulting at $1,000/unit)\n24.

Purchase20231231029: $3,000 (3 units of Basic Consulting at $1,000/unit)\n\nTotal Purchases = Sum of all the above = $1,107,000\n\n### Step 2: Identify Sale Transactions\nWe look for all transactions where the type is \"Sale\". These represent decreases in inventory (cost of goods sold).\n\nFrom the data, the sale transactions (cost amounts) are:\n1. Sale20240102003: $5,000\n2. Sale20240103005: $5,000\n3.

Sale20240205073: $5,000\n\nTotal Cost of Goods Sold = Sum of all the above = $1,107,000\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Net Change in Inventory\nThe net change in inventory is calculated as:\n(Total Purchases) - (Total Cost of Goods Sold) = $1,107,000 - $1,107,000 = $0\n\nHowever, since the cash flow statement shows the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" (i.e., the opposite of the net change), we invert the sign:\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory = - (Net Change in Inventory) = -$0 = $0\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '0.00'}}\n```",
