Typically, investing activities include purchases and sales of fixed assets, investments in securities, and other long-term assets.\n\nFrom the given data, the relevant transactions are:\n1. \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" with an amount of 85,889.19 (this is a cash outflow for investing activities).\n\nThere are no other transactions related to investing activities (such as sales of fixed assets or other investments) in the provided data.\n\nTherefore, the net cash flow from investing activities is simply the negative of the fixed assets purchase amount (since it's an outflow).\n\nCalculation:\nNet Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -85,889.19\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-85889.19'} }\n```",
