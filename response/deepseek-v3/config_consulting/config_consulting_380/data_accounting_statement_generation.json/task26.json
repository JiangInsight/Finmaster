Depreciation is typically recorded as an expense in the income statement and is listed under transactions with the type \"Depreciation\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Depreciation Transactions**: Look through the transactions data for entries where the \"type\" is \"Depreciation\".\n   \n2. **Extract the Amount**: For each depreciation transaction found, note the \"amount\" or \"recorded_amount\" (both should be the same for depreciation entries).\n\n3. **Sum the Depreciation Amounts**: If there are multiple depreciation entries, sum their amounts to get the total depreciation for the period. However, in the given data, there is only one depreciation entry.\n\n4. **Verify the Entry**: Ensure that the depreciation entry is correctly identified and that the amount is accurately extracted.\n\n### Applying to the Given Problem:\n\nLooking at the provided transactions data, we find the following entry:\n\n- **Depreciation Entry**:\n  - `id`: `Depreciation20240201002`\n  - `type`: `Depreciation`\n  - `amount`: `47117.43`\n  - `recorded_amount`: `47117.43`\n\nThis is the only depreciation entry in the data, so the total depreciation amount is `47117.43`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '47117.43'} }\n```",
