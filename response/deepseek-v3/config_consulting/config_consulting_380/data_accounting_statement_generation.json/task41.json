These represent the amounts that have been recorded as accounts payable but not yet paid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Unpaid Purchases with Payment Method \"Account Payable\":**\n   - Filter all transactions where:\n     - `type` is \"Purchase\"\n     - `payment_method` is \"Account Payable\"\n     - `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\"\n\n2. **List of Relevant Transactions:**\n   - From the given data, the following transactions meet the criteria:\n     - `Purchase20231231001`: Amount = 10,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231002`: Amount = 10,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231003`: Amount = 1,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231004`: Amount = 40,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231005`: Amount = 5,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231013`: Amount = 2,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231014`: Amount = 20,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231015`: Amount = 20,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231017`: Amount = 2,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231020`: Amount = 1,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231021`: Amount = 1,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231024`: Amount = 20,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231026`: Amount = 100,000.0\n\n3. **Sum the Amounts:**\n   - Total Accounts Payable = 10,000 + 10,000 + 1,000 + 40,000 + 5,000 + 2,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 + 2,000 + 1,000 + 1,000 + 20,000 + 100,000 = **232,000.0**\n\n4. **Final Calculation:**\n   - The \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is the total unpaid amount, which is **232,000.0**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '232000.00'}}\n```",
