Initial Bank Deposit\nFrom the transactions data, we can see that the initial bank deposit is recorded as follows:\n- **Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0**\n\nThis means the initial bank deposit is **5,000,000.00**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Changes in Bank Deposits\nBank deposits can change due to:\n1. **Bank Transfers (Payments)**: These are transactions where the payment method is \"Bank Transfer\" and the status is \"Paid\".\n2. **Cash to Bank Transfers**: These are transactions where the type is \"Cash to bank transfer\".\n\n####

Calculate Net Change in Bank Deposits\nNet change = Cash to bank transfers - Bank transfers (payments) - Fixed assets purchase\n- Net change = 1,500,000 - 628,000 - 85,889.19 = **786,110.81**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Final Bank Deposit\nFinal bank deposit = Initial bank deposit + Net change\n- Final bank deposit = 5,000,000 + 786,110.81 = **5,786,110.81**\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Bank Deposits Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Bank Deposits End Value': '5786110.81'} }\n```",
