I'm going to identify the four specific line items from the income statement based on the descriptions provided in the task. \n\n### Understanding the Task:\nWe need to extract four values corresponding to:\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**: This typically refers to \"Selling Expenses\" because these are costs related to marketing, sales, and distribution.\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually \"Financial Expenses\" as these are costs related to interest and other financing activities.\n3. **The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is \"Depreciation\".\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period**: This is \"Tax Expense\".\n\n### Analyzing the Given Income Statement:\nLet's look at the provided income statement and find these line items:\n\n| Account                | Amount     | Date       |\n|------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Selling Expenses       | 402699.98  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation           | 92870.67   | 2024-02-05 |\n| Financial Expenses     | 37809.98   | 2024-02-05 |\n| Tax Expense            | 131850.51  | 2024-02-05 |\n\n### Matching the Descriptions to the Line Items:\n1. **Selling Expenses (402699.98)**: Matches the first description about securing orders and delivering goods/services.\n2. **Depreciation (92870.67)**: Matches the third description about asset depreciation.\n3. **Financial Expenses (37809.98)**: Matches the second description about financing costs.\n4. **Tax Expense (131850.51)**: Matches the fourth description about taxes.\n\n### Order of Values:\nThe order in the example was:\n- value1: Selling Expenses\n- value2: Depreciation\n- value3: Financial Expenses\n- value4: Tax Expense\n\nSo, we'll maintain the same order here.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '402699.98', 'value2': '92870.67', 'value3': '37809.98', 'value4': '131850.51'}}\n```\n\n### Verification:\nLet me double-check:\n- Selling Expenses: 402699.98 笨能n- Depreciation: 92870.67 笨能n- Financial Expenses: 37809.98 笨能n- Tax Expense: 131850.51 笨能n\nOrder matches the example. Everything looks correct!\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '402699.98', 'value2': '92870.67', 'value3': '37809.98', 'value4': '131850.51'}}\n```",
