These items are typically classified as \"Fixed Assets\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: \n   - The balance sheet includes a line item called \"Fixed Assets,\" which represents tangible items used in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes.\n   - \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is related to fixed assets but represents the depreciation over time, not the tangible items themselves.\n   - \"Total Non-current Assets\" includes fixed assets and other non-current assets, but we are interested specifically in the tangible fixed assets.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The initial value of fixed assets is given as \"5000000.00\" as of the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n   - The end value of fixed assets is given as \"5085889.19\" as of the end date \"2024-02-05\".\n\n3. **Exclude Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - The accumulated depreciation is a contra-asset account that reduces the book value of fixed assets, but the question asks for the value of the tangible items themselves (i.e., the gross value of fixed assets before depreciation). Therefore, we use the \"Fixed Assets\" line item directly.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe initial and end values of the tangible fixed assets are as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5085889.19'} }\n```",
