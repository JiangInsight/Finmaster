In an income statement, these are usually listed under \"Financial Expenses\" or \"Interest Expenses.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing the Given Income Statement**: Looking at the provided income statement, we can see a line item labeled \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of \"37809.98\" dated \"2024-02-05.\"\n\n3. **Verification**: This line item is the most likely candidate for financing costs as it directly relates to the cost of raising funds (e.g., interest payments on debt).\n\n4. **Exclusion of Other Items**: Other line items like \"Administrative Expenses,\" \"Selling Expenses,\" and \"Depreciation\" are not related to financing costs. \"Interest Income\" is income earned from investments, not an expense.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The value of financing costs is the amount listed under \"Financial Expenses,\" which is \"37809.98.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '37809.98'} }\n```",
