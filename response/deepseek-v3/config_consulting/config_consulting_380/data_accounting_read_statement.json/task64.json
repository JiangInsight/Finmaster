                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement extraction task step by step. I'm going to go through each part of the problem to identify and extract the three specific line items as described.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to extract three specific values from the provided financial statements:\n\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under \"Paid-in Capital\" or similar.\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is usually the \"Profit Before Tax\" line in the Income Statement.\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This refers to the increase in \"Accounts Payable\" during the period, which can be found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n\nThe order to present these values is:\n1. Balance Sheet item first.\n2. Income Statement item second.\n3. Cash Flow Statement item third.\n\n### Extracting the Values\n\nLet's go through each financial statement one by one.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet provided, we're interested in the capital contributed by shareholders. This is usually listed under equity. \n\nIn the Balance Sheet table:\n```\n| Paid-in Capital | 13000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 13000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThis shows that the Paid-in Capital at the end of the period is `13000000.00`, and it hasn't changed from the initial amount. This is our first value.\n\n**Value1: '13000000.00'**\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nNext, we need the profit or loss before tax. This is explicitly given in the Income Statement as \"Profit Before Tax\".\n\nIn the Income Statement table:\n```\n| Profit Before Tax | 967117.02 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nSo, the profit before tax is `967117.02`.\n\n**Value2: '967117.02'**\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nNow, we need the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period. This refers to the increase in Accounts Payable.\n\nIn the Cash Flow Statement, we look for the line that shows the change in Accounts Payable:\n```\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 247000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThis indicates that Accounts Payable increased by `247000.00` during the period.\n\n**Value3: '247000.00'**\n\n### Verifying the Values\n\nLet's double-check each to ensure accuracy:\n\n1. **Paid-in Capital**: Confirmed as `13000000.00` in the Balance Sheet.\n2. **Profit Before Tax**: Confirmed as `967117.02` in the Income Statement.\n3. **Increase in Accounts Payable**: Confirmed as `247000.00` in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nAll values are correctly identified from their respective statements.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '967117.02', 'value3': '247000.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**:\n   - Located \"Paid-in Capital\" under equity.\n   - End amount: `13000000.00` → Value1.\n\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - Located \"Profit Before Tax\".\n   - Amount: `967117.02` → Value2.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - Located \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n   - Increase: `247000.00` → Value3.\n\nThus, the correct extraction is as above.",
