                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line item and value that represents the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit during the period. This is typically reflected in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section as \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Line Item**: The line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" indicates changes in the amounts owed by customers for goods or services sold on credit. A negative value here means an increase in accounts receivable (i.e., more amounts are owed to the entity), while a positive value would indicate a decrease (i.e., less amounts are owed to the entity).\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the given problem, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is present under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" with a value of \"-2117339.65.\"\n\n3. **Interpret the Value**: The negative value (-2117339.65) indicates an increase in accounts receivable, meaning more amounts are owed to the entity. However, the task asks for the \"decrease in amounts owed to the entity,\" which would be represented by a positive value. Since the value is negative, it does not represent a decrease but rather an increase. \n\n   - If the task were to ask for the \"increase in amounts owed,\" the answer would be the absolute value of the negative number. \n   - However, since the task specifically asks for the \"decrease,\" and the value is negative, there is no decrease in amounts owed during this period. \n\n   But based on the example provided, the solution seems to extract the value as it appears in the line item, regardless of whether it represents an increase or decrease. \n\n4. **Extract the Value**: Following the example, we extract the value as it appears in the line item, which is \"-2117339.65.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2117339.65'}}\n```",
