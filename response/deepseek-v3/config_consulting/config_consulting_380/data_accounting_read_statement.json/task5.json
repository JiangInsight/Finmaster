These assets are typically categorized as \"Inventory\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - From the given balance sheet, the line item that represents assets held for sale or in production is \"Inventory\".\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Amount**: The initial value of Inventory is listed as \"0.00\" on the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n   - **End Amount**: The end value of Inventory is listed as \"203000.00\" on the end date \"2024-02-05\".\n\n3. **Verify the Context**:\n   - The \"Inventory\" line item fits the description of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '203000.00'} }\n```",
