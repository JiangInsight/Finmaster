This typically refers to the \"Accounts Payable\" line item in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit is recorded under \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n2. **Locate the Accounts Payable in the Balance Sheet**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, \"Accounts Payable\" has an initial amount of `0.00` and an end amount of `247000.00`.\n\n3. **Determine the Addition in Accounts Payable**:\n   - The addition in the amount owed during the period is the difference between the end amount and the initial amount.\n   - Calculation: `End_amount - Initial_amount = 247000.00 - 0.00 = 247000.00`.\n\n4. **Verify with Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - The cash flow statement also shows the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" as `247000.00`, which confirms the addition in the amount owed.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is `247000.00`.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '247000.00'}}\n```",
