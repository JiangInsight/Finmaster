These are typically referred to as \"Current Assets\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Assets**: Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within one year or the operating cycle of the business, whichever is longer. In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of all such assets.\n\n2. **Locate Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The initial value of \"Total Current Assets\" is provided as \"8000000.00\" on the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n   - **End Value**: The end value of \"Total Current Assets\" is provided as \"9221098.50\" on the end date \"2024-02-05\".\n\n3. **Verify**: The \"Total Current Assets\" line item includes items like Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, Accounts Receivable, and Inventory, all of which are expected to be realized or consumed in the normal operating cycle.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '9221098.50'}}\n```",
