In cash flow statements, this is typically labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" or a similar term.\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, we look for a line item that matches this description. \n   - The line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" is present with an amount of `131850.51`.\n3. **Verify the Context**: This line item is under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, which is the correct section for such adjustments related to accrued taxes.\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with this line item is `131850.51`, which represents the increase in tax payable (i.e., tax accrued but not yet paid).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '131850.51'}}\n```",
