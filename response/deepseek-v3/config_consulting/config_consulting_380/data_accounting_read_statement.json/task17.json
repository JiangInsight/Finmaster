                        "content": "### Understanding the Task\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the task is asking. The goal is to identify two specific line items from a balance sheet:\n\n1. **Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit**: This typically refers to \"Accounts Receivable\" in accounting terms. It represents money that customers owe the company for products or services delivered but not yet paid for.\n   \n2. **Amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit**: This usually corresponds to \"Accounts Payable\". It's the money the company owes to its suppliers or vendors for goods or services received but not yet paid for.\n\nThe task requires extracting the initial and final values for both these line items from the given balance sheet.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Balance Sheet\n\nThe balance sheet is presented in a markdown table format with the following columns:\n- Account\n- Initial_amount\n- Initial_date\n- End_amount\n- End_date\n\nI'll scan the table to find the rows corresponding to \"Accounts Receivable\" and \"Accounts Payable\".\n\n### Identifying \"Accounts Receivable\"\n\nLooking at the \"Account\" column, I see the following relevant entry:\n- **Accounts Receivable**:\n  - Initial_amount: 0.00\n  - End_amount: 2117339.65\n\nThis matches the first line item we're interested in: amounts owed to the entity (i.e., money customers owe the company).\n\n### Identifying \"Accounts Payable\"\n\nNext, I look for \"Accounts Payable\":\n- **Accounts Payable**:\n  - Initial_amount: 0.00\n  - End_amount: 247000.00\n\nThis corresponds to the second line item: amounts owed by the entity (i.e., money the company owes to suppliers).\n\n### Verifying the Order\n\nThe task mentions that for multiple outputs, the original line item order as shown in the input statement should be maintained. In the given balance sheet, \"Accounts Receivable\" appears before \"Accounts Payable\", so we'll present them in that order.\n\n### Extracting Values\n\nNow, let's extract the initial and final values for both:\n\n1. **Accounts Receivable**:\n   - Initial value: 0.00\n   - End value: 2117339.65\n\n2. **Accounts Payable**:\n   - Initial value: 0.00\n   - End value: 247000.00\n\n### Formatting the Answer\n\nThe solution should be presented in a JSON format with keys as follows:\n- 'initial value1': Initial amount for Accounts Receivable\n- 'end valu1': End amount for Accounts Receivable\n- 'initial value2': Initial amount for Accounts Payable\n- 'end valu2': End amount for Accounts Payable\n\n(Note: There seems to be a typo in the example where 'end valu1' and 'end valu2' are missing an 'e'. I'll follow the same format for consistency.)\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '0.00', 'end valu1': '2117339.65', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '247000.00'} }\n```",
