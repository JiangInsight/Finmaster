I'm going to break it down to understand how to find the net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period, and then identify its two component sub-items.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nWe have a cash flow statement with several line items. The task is to:\n\n1. Identify the specific line item that shows the net addition (or decrease) in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n2. Extract the value of this net addition.\n3. Decompose this net addition into two sub-items that are part of its calculation.\n4. Ensure all these items come from the provided cash flow statement.\n\nFrom the example given, it seems that:\n\n- The \"Net Increase\" in \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" is the value we're interested in.\n- This \"Net Increase\" is calculated by taking the difference between the \"Ending Balance\" and the \"Beginning Balance\" of cash and cash equivalents.\n  - So, Net Increase = Ending Balance - Beginning Balance.\n  - Therefore, the two sub-items are \"Beginning Balance\" and \"Ending Balance\".\n\n### Applying This to the Given Problem\n\nLooking at the provided cash flow statement:\n\nUnder the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, we have:\n\n- Beginning Balance: 8,000,000.00\n- Ending Balance: 6,885,735.26\n- Net Increase: -1,114,264.74\n\nSo, calculating:\n\nNet Increase = Ending Balance - Beginning Balance  \n= 6,885,735.26 - 8,000,000.00  \n= -1,114,264.74\n\nThis matches the given \"Net Increase\" value.\n\n### Identifying the Required Output\n\nFrom this:\n\n- 'value': The \"Net Increase\" amount, which is \"-1114264.74\".\n- 'sub_items':\n  - 'sub_item value1': \"Beginning Balance\", which is \"8000000.00\".\n  - 'sub_item value2': \"Ending Balance\", which is \"6885735.26\".\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1114264.74', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_item value2': '6885735.26'}}}\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n1. The \"Net Increase\" is indeed -1,114,264.74.\n2. It's calculated from:\n   - Beginning: 8,000,000.00\n   - Ending: 6,885,735.26\n   - Difference: 6,885,735.26 - 8,000,000.00 = -1,114,264.74\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the cash flow statement and understanding how the net increase in cash and cash equivalents is derived, the solution is correctly identified and formatted as requested.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1114264.74', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_item value2': '6885735.26'}}}\n```",
