The key line item to look for is \"Bank Deposits,\" as it directly represents the funds deposited into a bank. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: In the balance sheet, the line item \"Bank Deposits\" is the one that indicates the funds deposited into a bank. This is the item we need to focus on.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**: The initial value of the bank deposits is given under the \"Initial_amount\" column for the \"Bank Deposits\" row. In the provided problem, this value is \"5000000.00\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**: The end value of the bank deposits is given under the \"End_amount\" column for the \"Bank Deposits\" row. In the provided problem, this value is \"4283110.81\".\n\n4. **Construct the Solution**: The solution should be presented in the specified JSON format, with the initial and end values filled in.\n\nHere is the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '4283110.81'} }\n```",
