This is found in the Cash Flow Statement.\n   \n2. **Amounts of taxes accrued but not yet paid**: This refers to \"Taxes Payable\" and is found in the Balance Sheet under current liabilities.\n   \n3. **Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities**: This is the \"Total Revenue\" from the Income Statement.\n\nThe outputs should be grouped by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, the original line item order should be maintained.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Financial Statements\n\nLet's go through each financial statement to locate the required items.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\nLooking for \"Taxes Payable\":\n- In the Balance Sheet, under \"Account\", we find \"Taxes Payable\".\n- The \"End_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\" is \"131850.51\".\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\nLooking for \"Total Revenue\":\n- In the Income Statement, under \"Account\", we find \"Total Revenue\".\n- The \"Amount\" for \"Total Revenue\" is \"2637011.03\".\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nLooking for \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\":\n- In the Cash Flow Statement, under \"Account\", we find \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\".\n- The \"Amount\" for \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" is \"-1028375.55\".\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe order of the financial statements is correct as per the requirement (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement). The line items are also in their original order within each statement.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe extracted values are:\n1. Taxes Payable (Balance Sheet): \"131850.51\"\n2. Total Revenue (Income Statement): \"2637011.03\"\n3. Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities (Cash Flow Statement): \"-1028375.55\"\n\n### JSON Format\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '131850.51', 'value2': '2637011.03', 'value3': '-1028375.55'}}\n```",
