This account represents interest that has been earned but not yet received. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Value**: In the balance sheet, under the \"Interest Receivable\" account, the initial amount is listed as \"0.00\" with the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n2. **End Value**: The end amount for \"Interest Receivable\" is listed as \"15023.59\" with the end date \"2024-02-05\".\n\nThus, the initial value is \"0.00\" and the end value is \"15023.59\".\n\nThe solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '15023.59'} }\n```",
