This typically refers to \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet, as it represents the amounts owed to suppliers or vendors for goods or services received on credit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item that represents amounts owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit is \"Accounts Payable\". This is a liability account that records the company's obligations to pay off short-term debts to its creditors or suppliers.\n\n2. **Locate the Initial and End Values**:\n   - In the given balance sheet, the \"Accounts Payable\" line item shows:\n     - **Initial_amount**: 0.00 (as of the Initial_date: 2023-12-31)\n     - **End_amount**: 247000.00 (as of the End_date: 2024-02-05)\n\n3. **Verify the Context**:\n   - The initial value is 0.00, which means there were no outstanding payables at the beginning of the period (2023-12-31).\n   - The end value is 247000.00, which means the entity owed this amount to its suppliers or creditors at the end of the period (2024-02-05).\n\n4. **Exclude Other Liabilities**:\n   - Other liabilities like \"Taxes Payable\" are not related to goods or services received on credit, so they are not included in the solution.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '247000.00'} }\n```",
