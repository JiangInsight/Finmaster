These represent the liquid assets that the entity can readily use for its operational needs.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Cash-Related Line Items**:\n   - \"Cash on Hand\": This is physical cash available to the entity.\n   - \"Bank Deposits\": These are funds held in bank accounts that can be accessed for daily operations.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - For \"Cash on Hand\":\n     - Initial value: 3000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End value: 2602624.45 (as of 2024-02-05)\n   - For \"Bank Deposits\":\n     - Initial value: 5000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End value: 4283110.81 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n3. **Sum the Values**:\n   - Initial total cash available: 3000000.00 (Cash on Hand) + 5000000.00 (Bank Deposits) = 8000000.00\n   - End total cash available: 2602624.45 (Cash on Hand) + 4283110.81 (Bank Deposits) = 6885735.26\n\nHowever, the example provided in the task description only included \"Cash on Hand\" in the solution, not the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\". Following the example's format, we will only include \"Cash on Hand\" in the solution.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '3000000.00', 'end value': '2602624.45'} }\n```",
