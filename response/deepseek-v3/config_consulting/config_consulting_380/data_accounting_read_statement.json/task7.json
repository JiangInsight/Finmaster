Typically, expenses that appear in the balance sheet are related to accumulated depreciation or other similar items.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Expense-Related Line Items**: \n   - In the balance sheet, expenses are often reflected in items like \"Accumulated Depreciation\" or \"Accrued Expenses\". \n   - In the given problem, the line item \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is present, which is a common expense-related item in the balance sheet.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item has:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: 92870.67 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n3. **Verify Relevance**:\n   - Accumulated Depreciation is an expense that reduces the value of fixed assets over time and is recorded in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as part of depreciation expense.\n   - Therefore, it fits the criteria of an expense to be extracted.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The initial value is '0.00' and the end value is '92870.67'.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '92870.67'} }\n```",
