                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through the cash flow statement provided and identify the four specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nFirst, let's recap what we're supposed to extract based on the task description:\n\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is commonly known as \"Depreciation.\"\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period**: This refers to changes in \"Inventory.\"\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends**: This is typically the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\"\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nNow, let's look at the provided cash flow statement and find these items.\n\n### Analyzing the Cash Flow Statement\n\nHere's the cash flow statement we're working with:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit  | 835266.51 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation  | 92870.67 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -2117339.65 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -15023.59 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -203000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 247000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 131850.51 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -1028375.55 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 85889.19 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -85889.19 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Ending Balance  | 6885735.26 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Increase  | -1114264.74 | 2024-02-05 |\n\n### Identifying the Four Line Items\n\n1. **Depreciation**: \n   - This is clearly listed as \"Depreciation\" with an amount of \"92870.67\".\n\n2. **Change in Inventory**:\n   - The line item is \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\". The amount is \"-203000.00\". \n   - A negative value here indicates an increase in inventory (since it's a cash outflow), which aligns with the description of \"reduction in the amount of assets held for sale...\". Wait, actually, the description is about the \"reduction\", but the line item is \"(Increase) Decrease\". If inventory increases, it's a reduction in cash (negative here), and if inventory decreases, it's a positive. So the value is \"-203000.00\".\n\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - This is directly listed as \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with a value of \"-85889.19\".\n\n4. **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n   - This is listed as \"Net Increase\" with a value of \"-1114264.74\".\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the provided example to ensure we're matching correctly:\n\n- value1: Depreciation\n- value2: (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\n- value3: Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n- value4: Net Increase\n\nThis matches our identification.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling the values in the required order:\n\n1. Depreciation: '92870.67'\n2. (Increase) Decrease in Inventory: '-203000.00'\n3. Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: '-85889.19'\n4. Net Increase: '-1114264.74'\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '92870.67', 'value2': '-203000.00', 'value3': '-85889.19', 'value4': '-1114264.74'} }\n```",
