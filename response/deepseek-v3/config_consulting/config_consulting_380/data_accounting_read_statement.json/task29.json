There are no other revenue line items like \"Other Operating Revenue\" or \"Sales Revenue\" listed.\n- Therefore, the only sub-item we can decompose \"Total Revenue\" into is \"Main Business Revenue\".\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nFollowing the example's structure:\n\n- 'value': '2637011.03' (Total Revenue)\n- 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '2637011.03'} (Main Business Revenue)\n\nHowever, the example's solution format is slightly different from the instruction's proposed format. The instruction suggests:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '______', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '______'} }\n```\n\nThis seems to flatten the 'sub_items' dictionary into a key with an underscore. So, adapting:\n\n- 'sub_items_sub_item value' would be the value of the sub_item, which is '2637011.03'.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2637011.03', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '2637011.03'} }\n```",
