This account represents the cumulative amount of profits or losses that have been retained in the entity rather than distributed to shareholders.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**: The initial value of \"Retained Earnings\" is given under the \"Initial_amount\" column. In the provided problem, the initial value is \"0.00\" as of the \"Initial_date\" (2023-12-31).\n\n3. **Extract End Value**: The end value of \"Retained Earnings\" is given under the \"End_amount\" column. In the provided problem, the end value is \"835266.51\" as of the \"End_date\" (2024-02-05).\n\n### Solution:\nThe initial and end values of \"Retained Earnings\" are as follows:\n- Initial value: \"0.00\"\n- End value: \"835266.51\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '835266.51'} }\n```",
