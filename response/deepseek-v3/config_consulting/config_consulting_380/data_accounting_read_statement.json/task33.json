In the given problem, this is \"Main Business Revenue\" with the value \"2637011.03\".\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is typically the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) line item, as it represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the entity. In the given problem, this is \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with the value \"1015000.00\".\n\nThe order of the values in the solution should match the order of the line items as they appear in the income statement. \n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the line item for core operating income: \"Main Business Revenue\" → \"2637011.03\".\n2. Identify the line item for the carrying amount of inventories sold: \"Cost of Goods Sold\" → \"1015000.00\".\n3. Ensure the order matches the original statement: \"Main Business Revenue\" appears before \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2637011.03', 'value2': '1015000.00'}}\n```",
