                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we're interested in.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific values from the financial statements:\n1. **Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit**: This typically refers to \"Accounts Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet.\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually \"Financial Expenses\" in the Income Statement.\n3. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is often \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThe order in which we present these values is important: Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement, then Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet - Accounts Receivable\nLooking at the Balance Sheet section, we have a line item called \"Accounts Receivable\". The \"End_amount\" for this is what we're interested in because it represents the amount owed to the entity at the end of the period.\n\nFrom the table:\n```\nAccounts Receivable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 2117339.65 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nSo, `value1 = '2117339.65'`.\n\n### 2. Income Statement - Financial Expenses\nNow, moving to the Income Statement, we look for \"Financial Expenses\".\n\nFrom the table:\n```\nFinancial Expenses | 37809.98 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThis is the financing costs incurred. So, `value2 = '37809.98'`.\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement - Purchase of Fixed Assets\nFinally, in the Cash Flow Statement, we're interested in \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\", which represents cash payments for long-term assets.\n\nFrom the table:\n```\nPurchase of Fixed Assets  | 85889.19 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nSo, `value3 = '85889.19'`.\n\n### Verifying the Order\nJust to double-check, the order is:\n1. Balance Sheet (Accounts Receivable)\n2. Income Statement (Financial Expenses)\n3. Cash Flow Statement (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n\nAll the values we've extracted fit this order correctly.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2117339.65', 'value2': '37809.98', 'value3': '85889.19'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. **Balance Sheet**: Located \"Accounts Receivable\" and took the \"End_amount\" → 2117339.65.\n2. **Income Statement**: Found \"Financial Expenses\" and took the \"Amount\" → 37809.98.\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**: Identified \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" and took the \"Amount\" → 85889.19.\n4. Combined these in the specified order to form the final answer.\n\nThis seems correct based on the given data and the task's requirements.",
