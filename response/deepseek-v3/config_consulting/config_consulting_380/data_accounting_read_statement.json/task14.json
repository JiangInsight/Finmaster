These are typically classified as \"Current Liabilities\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Liabilities**: \n   - Current liabilities are obligations that are expected to be settled within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually within one year). \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Current Liabilities\" are \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\". The total of these is given as \"Total Current Liabilities\".\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `378850.51` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-02-05`.\n\n3. **Verify**:\n   - The sum of \"Accounts Payable\" (`247000.00`) and \"Taxes Payable\" (`131850.51`) equals the \"Total Current Liabilities\" (`378850.51`), confirming the correctness of the extracted values.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '378850.51'}}\n```",
