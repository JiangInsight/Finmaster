This refers to the depreciation expense recorded in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding Depreciation**: Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. It is recorded as an expense in the income statement and also appears in the cash flow statement under operating activities.\n\n2. **Locating Depreciation in the Financial Statements**:\n   - **Income Statement**: The income statement lists \"Depreciation\" as a line item under expenses. In the given problem, the income statement shows a depreciation value of `92870.67` for the date `2024-02-05`.\n   - **Cash Flow Statement**: The cash flow statement also lists \"Depreciation\" under operating activities, confirming the same value of `92870.67` for the date `2024-02-05`.\n   - **Balance Sheet**: The balance sheet shows \"Accumulated Depreciation\" under non-current assets, which is the cumulative depreciation over time. The end amount here is `92870.67` for the date `2024-02-05`, which matches the depreciation expense for the period.\n\n3. **Verification**: The depreciation value is consistent across the income statement and cash flow statement, confirming that `92870.67` is the correct value for the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life for the given period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '92870.67'}}\n```",
