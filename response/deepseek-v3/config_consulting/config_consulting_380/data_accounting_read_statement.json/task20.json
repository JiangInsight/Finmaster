COGS reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, including the cost of materials and labor directly used to create the goods.\n   \n2. **Locating the Line Item**: In the given income statement, we look for the line item labeled \"Cost of Goods Sold.\" From the table, we can see:\n   ```\n   | Cost of Goods Sold | 1015000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n   ```\n   This is the line item that represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\n3. **Extracting the Value**: The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is `1015000.00`.\n\n4. **Verification**: To ensure this is correct, we can cross-check with the \"Gross Profit\" calculation. Gross Profit is calculated as:\n   ```\n   Gross Profit = Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold\n   ```\n   From the table:\n   ```\n   Total Revenue = 2637011.03\n   Cost of Goods Sold = 1015000.00\n   Gross Profit = 2637011.03 - 1015000.00 = 1622011.03\n   ```\n   This matches the \"Gross Profit\" value in the table (`1622011.03`), confirming that \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is correctly identified.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1015000.00'}}\n```",
