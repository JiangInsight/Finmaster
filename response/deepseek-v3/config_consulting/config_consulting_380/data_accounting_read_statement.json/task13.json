These are typically non-current assets, such as fixed assets and accumulated depreciation, which are not part of the regular operating cycle.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Criteria**: \n   - Non-current assets are those not expected to be converted into cash or used up within one year or the normal operating cycle of the business. \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Total Non-current Assets\" fit this criteria. \n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Line Items**:\n   - \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation\" are part of non-current assets. \n   - The \"Total Non-current Assets\" line summarizes these items and represents the net value of non-current assets.\n\n3. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Non-current Assets\" is `5000000.00` as of `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Non-current Assets\" is `4993018.52` as of `2024-02-05`.\n\n4. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The initial value matches the \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Non-current Assets\".\n   - The end value is the \"End_amount\" for \"Total Non-current Assets\", which is calculated as:\n     - Fixed Assets (`5085889.19`) minus Accumulated Depreciation (`92870.67`) = `4993018.52`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '4993018.52'} }\n```",
