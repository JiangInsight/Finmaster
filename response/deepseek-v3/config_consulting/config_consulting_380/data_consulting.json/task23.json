                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods and services.\n   \n   The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: This ratio indicates a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It shows how much cash flow is available to pay off debt.\n   \n   The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   \n   Here, \"Total Debt\" can be interpreted as the \"Total Liabilities\" from the balance sheet. However, in the given balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" which is \\$378,850.51. There are no long-term liabilities mentioned, so we'll consider \"Total Current Liabilities\" as the \"Total Debt\" for this calculation.\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **Income Statement**:\n- Total Revenue: \\$2,637,011.03\n- Gross Profit: \\$1,622,011.03\n\nFrom the **Cash Flow Statement**:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$1,028,375.55\n\nFrom the **Balance Sheet**:\n- Total Current Liabilities (Total Debt for this purpose): \\$378,850.51\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,622,011.03}{2,637,011.03} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\\[\n\\frac{1,622,011.03}{2,637,011.03} \\approx 0.6151\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\\[\n0.6151 \\times 100 \\approx 61.51\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **61.51%**.\n\n### Calculating Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-1,028,375.55}{378,850.51}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{-1,028,375.55}{378,850.51} \\approx -2.714\n\\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-2.71**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit / Total Revenue = 1,622,011.03 / 2,637,011.03 ≈ 0.6151 → 61.51%\n   - This seems correct.\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   - Net Operating Cash Flow is negative, which isn't uncommon, but it means the ratio is negative.\n   - -1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 ≈ -2.714\n   - This also seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating both ratios, here's the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '61.51%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.71'}}\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin**: A margin of 61.51% is quite healthy, indicating that the company retains a significant portion of revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold.\n  \n- **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: A negative ratio (-2.71) suggests that the company's operating cash flow is negative, meaning it's not generating enough cash from operations to cover its current liabilities. This could be a concern unless the negative cash flow is a temporary situation due to, for example, significant investments or one-time expenses.\n\nGiven that the company has a positive net profit (\\$835,266.51) but negative operating cash flow, it might be due to increases in accounts receivable and inventory, which are uses of cash, as seen in the cash flow statement. This is something the company might want to monitor closely to ensure liquidity.",
