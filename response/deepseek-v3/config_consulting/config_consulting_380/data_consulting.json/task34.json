                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through them step by step, explaining how I calculate each one based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,028,375.55\n\nFrom the balance sheet (End_amount):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51\n\nCalculation:\n- -1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 ≈ -2.71\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51 (since there's no long-term debt listed)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 13,835,266.51\n\nCalculation:\n- 378,850.51 / 13,835,266.51 ≈ 0.0274\n\nWait a minute, the example had a higher ratio. Maybe I'm missing something. Looking back, the example included all liabilities (current and non-current), but here we only have current liabilities. So if there's no long-term debt, then total debt is just current liabilities. So the ratio is indeed small.\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 2,637,011.03\n\nAverage Total Assets:\n- Initial Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets = 14,214,117.02\n- Average = (13,000,000 + 14,214,117.02) / 2 = 13,607,058.51\n\nCalculation:\n- 2,637,011.03 / 13,607,058.51 ≈ 0.194\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 9,221,098.50\n- Inventory = 203,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 378,850.51\n\nCalculation:\n- (9,221,098.50 - 203,000) / 378,850.51 = 9,018,098.50 / 378,850.51 ≈ 23.80\n\nHmm, this seems very high compared to the example. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check:\nQuick assets are Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable.\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 2,602,624.45\n- Bank Deposits = 4,283,110.81\n- Interest Receivable = 15,023.59\n- Accounts Receivable = 2,117,339.65\nTotal quick assets = 2,602,624.45 + 4,283,110.81 + 15,023.59 + 2,117,339.65 = 9,018,098.50\nCurrent Liabilities = 378,850.51\nSo Quick Ratio = 9,018,098.50 / 378,850.51 ≈ 23.80\nThis seems correct based on the data, but it's unusually high. Maybe the current liabilities are unusually low.\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nThis is the same as the first ratio, Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\nSo it's also -2.71.\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Income / Average Shareholder's Equity\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 835,266.51\n\nAverage Equity:\n- Initial Equity = 13,000,000.00\n- End Equity = 13,835,266.51\n- Average = (13,000,000 + 13,835,266.51) / 2 = 13,417,633.255\n\nCalculation:\n- 835,266.51 / 13,417,633.255 ≈ 0.0623 or 6.23%\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since we don't have the breakdown):\nNet Sales = 2,637,011.03\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00\n- End Accounts Receivable = 2,117,339.65\n- Average = (0 + 2,117,339.65) / 2 = 1,058,669.825\n\nCalculation:\n- 2,637,011.03 / 1,058,669.825 ≈ 2.49\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.71', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.19', 'Quick Ratio': '23.80', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.71', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '6.23%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.49'}}\n```\n\n**Reviewing the Quick Ratio:**\nThe quick ratio seems unusually high (23.80), which suggests that the company has a lot of liquid assets compared to its current liabilities. This could be accurate given the data, where current assets are significantly higher than current liabilities. Alternatively, if \"Bank Deposits\" are not considered liquid, we might exclude them, but typically they are. \n\nIf we consider only the most liquid assets (Cash + Accounts Receivable):\n- Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable = 2,602,624.45 + 4,283,110.81 + 2,117,339.65 = 9,003,074.91\nQuick Ratio = 9,003,074.91 / 378,850.51 ≈ 23.76 (still very high)\nThis seems to be the correct interpretation based on the data provided.\n\n**Debt to Equity Ratio:**\nInitially, I calculated it as 0.027, rounded to 0.03. The example had 0.16, but here the debt is much lower relative to equity.\n\n**Total Asset Turnover:**\nCalculated as 0.19, which seems reasonable given the revenue and asset size.\n\n**Accounts Receivable Turnover:**\nCalculated as 2.49, which means receivables are turning over about 2.5 times in the period.\n\n**ROE:**\n6.23% seems reasonable for the net income and equity figures.\n\nThus, the final ratios seem correct based on the provided data. The high quick ratio is notable but mathematically correct given the numbers.",
