                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Equity Ratio, the Net Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of debt financing relative to equity financing. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 378,850.51\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 13,835,266.51\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{378,850.51}{13,835,266.51} \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ \\frac{378,850.51}{13,835,266.51} \\approx 0.0274 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.03\n\nBut looking at the example, it seems they might have used more decimal places or different rounding. Let me check if I missed any liabilities. \n\nWait, in the balance sheet, under liabilities, only \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\" are listed, summing to \"Total Current Liabilities\". There's no mention of long-term debt or other liabilities. So, total liabilities are indeed 378,850.51.\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 0.027, which is 0.03 when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nBut the example had a ratio of 0.16, which seems higher. Maybe they included something else. Here, since there's no other debt, it's just current liabilities over equity, which is quite low.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Debt\" is considered as all liabilities, which here is just current liabilities. So, 378,850.51 / 13,835,266.51 ≈ 0.027.\n\nPerhaps the correct interpretation is to use all liabilities over equity, which here is just current liabilities, giving 0.027.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with 0.03 for now.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net profit is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** 835,266.51\n- **Total Revenue:** 2,637,011.03\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{835,266.51}{2,637,011.03} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ \\frac{835,266.51}{2,637,011.03} \\approx 0.3167 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.3167 \\times 100 \\approx 31.67\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is approximately 31.67%.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to cover its current liabilities with cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -1,028,375.55\n- From the balance sheet:\n  - **Total Current Liabilities:** 378,850.51\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-1,028,375.55}{378,850.51} \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-1,028,375.55}{378,850.51} \\approx -2.714 \\]\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately -2.71.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios:\n\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.03\n- Net Profit Margin: 31.67%\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: -2.71\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the Debt to Equity Ratio was 0.16, which is higher than what I got. Maybe I missed something. \n\nWait, in the example, total current liabilities were 1,861,550.92, and total owner's equity was 11,354,858.57, so:\n\n1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.1639, which rounds to 0.16.\n\nIn our case, total liabilities are much smaller relative to equity, so 0.03 seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, the example had a negative net profit margin, and ours is positive.\n\nThe operating cash flow to current liabilities was -3.90 in the example, and ours is -2.71, which makes sense given the numbers.\n\nSo, my calculations seem correct based on the provided data.\n\nFinal JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.67%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.71'} }\n```\n\nHowever, looking at the numbers again for the Debt to Equity Ratio, perhaps it's better to keep more decimal places to match the example's precision. The exact calculation is:\n\n378,850.51 / 13,835,266.51 ≈ 0.02738, which is approximately 0.027 or 0.03 when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nGiven that, and since the example had two decimal places (0.16), I'll keep it as '0.03'.\n\nAlternatively, if we express it as a decimal without rounding, it's '0.03'. If we want more precision, it could be '0.027', but '0.03' seems standard.\n\nSimilarly, Net Profit Margin is exactly 835,266.51 / 2,637,011.03 ≈ 0.3167 or 31.67%.\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities is exactly -1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 ≈ -2.714, so '-2.71' is appropriate.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.67%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.71'} }\n```",
