                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio, Gross Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 378,850.51\n- **Total Non-current Liabilities:** Not provided explicitly, but looking at the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are under \"Total Current Liabilities.\" There's no separate line for long-term debt or non-current liabilities. So, it seems the company doesn't have any non-current liabilities.\n  \nTherefore:\n- **Total Liabilities:** 378,850.51\n- **Total Assets (End_amount):** 14,214,117.02\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{378,850.51}{14,214,117.02} \\approx 0.02665 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.03\n\nBut looking back at the example provided, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated using only current liabilities (even though the name suggests total debt). Maybe in this context, \"Debt\" refers to current liabilities. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider that \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" equals \"Total Assets,\" and \"Total Liabilities\" would be the difference between \"Total Assets\" and \"Total Owner's Equity\":\n\nTotal Liabilities = Total Assets - Total Owner's Equity\n= 14,214,117.02 - 13,835,266.51\n= 378,850.51\n\nWhich matches the \"Total Current Liabilities.\" So, it seems the company has no long-term debt, and total liabilities are just current liabilities.\n\nSo, the calculation stands:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{378,850.51}{14,214,117.02} \\approx 0.02665 \\]\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.03\n\nBut the example had a higher ratio with similar numbers, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe \"Debt\" includes all liabilities, which here is just current liabilities.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with 0.03.\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 1,622,011.03\n- **Total Revenue:** 2,637,011.03\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,622,011.03}{2,637,011.03} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 61.51\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operating activities. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -1,028,375.55\n- **Current Liabilities (from balance sheet):** 378,850.51\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-1,028,375.55}{378,850.51} \\approx -2.71 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Gross Profit Margin': '61.51%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.71'}}\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated as Total Current Liabilities / Total Assets, which would give us the same as above (0.03). Maybe the example had more liabilities. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider that \"Debt\" might include all liabilities (which here is just current), then it's correct.\n\nThe Gross Profit Margin seems correct based on the numbers.\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio is negative, which makes sense given the negative operating cash flow.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Gross Profit Margin': '61.51%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.71'}}\n```",
