                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: Return on Equity (ROE), Debt to Asset Ratio, and Gross Profit Margin. \n\n### 1. Understanding the Ratios\n\n**a. Return on Equity (ROE):**\nThis measures how effectively a company is using its shareholders' equity to generate profit. The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Shareholder's Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n*Note:* Sometimes, the ending shareholder's equity is used if beginning figures aren't provided or if changes are minimal. Here, we have both initial and end amounts, so we can calculate the average.\n\n**b. Debt to Asset Ratio:**\nThis shows the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n*Note:* Total liabilities here would be the sum of all liabilities, which in this case is just the \"Total Current Liabilities\" since no long-term liabilities are mentioned.\n\n**c. Gross Profit Margin:**\nThis indicates the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\n### 2. Extracting Necessary Data from the Financial Statements\n\nLet's pull out the numbers we need from each statement.\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- **Total Assets (End):** 14,214,117.02\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End):** 378,850.51\n- **Paid-in Capital (End):** 13,000,000.00\n- **Retained Earnings (End):** 835,266.51\n- **Total Owner's Equity (End):** 13,835,266.51\n  - *This is the sum of Paid-in Capital and Retained Earnings.*\n  \n*Initial Owner's Equity:*\n- **Paid-in Capital (Initial):** 13,000,000.00\n- **Retained Earnings (Initial):** 0.00\n- **Total Owner's Equity (Initial):** 13,000,000.00\n\n**From the Income Statement:**\n- **Net Profit:** 835,266.51\n- **Total Revenue:** 2,637,011.03\n- **Gross Profit:** 1,622,011.03\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** 1,015,000.00\n\n### 3. Calculating Each Ratio\n\n**a. Return on Equity (ROE):**\nFirst, calculate average shareholder's equity:\n\\[ \\text{Average Equity} = \\frac{\\text{Initial Equity} + \\text{End Equity}}{2} = \\frac{13,000,000 + 13,835,266.51}{2} = \\frac{26,835,266.51}{2} = 13,417,633.255 \\]\n\nNow, ROE:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{835,266.51}{13,417,633.255} \\times 100 \\approx 6.23\\% \\]\n\n*Note:* Sometimes, especially in cases where the equity changes significantly, using ending equity might be more appropriate. If we use ending equity:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{835,266.51}{13,835,266.51} \\times 100 \\approx 6.04\\% \\]\nGiven that the initial retained earnings were zero, and all profit was added to equity, using ending equity might slightly understate ROE. The average is more accurate here, so we'll go with 6.23%.\n\n**b. Debt to Asset Ratio:**\nTotal Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51\nTotal Assets = 14,214,117.02\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{378,850.51}{14,214,117.02} \\approx 0.0266 \\]\nRounded to two decimal places: 0.03\n\n*Wait a minute,* in the example provided, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated as Total Current Liabilities / Total Assets. But looking at the balance sheet, there are no long-term liabilities, so this seems correct. However, the example had a higher ratio because their current liabilities were higher relative to assets. Here, it's quite low because liabilities are small compared to assets.\n\n**c. Gross Profit Margin:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{1,622,011.03}{2,637,011.03} \\times 100 \\approx 61.51\\% \\]\n\n### 4. Verifying Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure no mistakes.\n\n- **ROE:**\n  - Net Profit: 835,266.51\n  - Average Equity: (13,000,000 + 13,835,266.51)/2 = 13,417,633.255\n  - 835,266.51 / 13,417,633.255 ≈ 0.0623 → 6.23%\n\n- **Debt to Asset:**\n  - Liabilities: 378,850.51\n  - Assets: 14,214,117.02\n  - 378,850.51 / 14,214,117.02 ≈ 0.0266 → 0.03\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin:**\n  - Gross Profit: 1,622,011.03\n  - Revenue: 2,637,011.03\n  - 1,622,011.03 / 2,637,011.03 ≈ 0.6151 → 61.51%\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### 5. Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '6.23%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Gross Profit Margin': '61.51%'} }\n```\n\n*Note:* If the convention is to use ending equity for ROE (as sometimes done when the beginning equity isn't representative), then ROE would be 6.04%. However, given that we have both initial and end figures, using average equity is more accurate, leading to 6.23%. \n\nSimilarly, the Debt to Asset Ratio is very low (0.03) because the company has minimal liabilities compared to its assets. This indicates a very low level of debt financing.\n\nThe Gross Profit Margin is high at 61.51%, indicating that the company retains a significant portion of revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold.",
