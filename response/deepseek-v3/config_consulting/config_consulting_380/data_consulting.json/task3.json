                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Asset Ratio\n\nFirst, what is the Debt to Asset Ratio? From what I understand, it's a financial metric that shows the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated by dividing the company's total liabilities by its total assets. \n\nThe formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nA higher ratio means more of the company's assets are financed by debt, which could indicate higher financial risk.\n\n### Identifying the Necessary Figures from the Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the provided balance sheet, we need two key figures:\n1. **Total Liabilities**: This is the sum of all the company's debts or obligations.\n2. **Total Assets**: This is the sum of everything the company owns that has value.\n\nFrom the balance sheet, the relevant lines are:\n\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: This is part of the total liabilities. In the given data, it's listed as \"Total Current Liabilities\" with an \"End_amount\" of 378,850.51.\n  \n  Wait a minute, is \"Total Current Liabilities\" the same as \"Total Liabilities\"? Or are there other liabilities not listed here? \n\nLooking at the example provided earlier, the \"Total Current Liabilities\" was the only liability listed, and the solution used that as the total liabilities. So, in this case, it seems that \"Total Current Liabilities\" is the same as \"Total Liabilities\" because there are no other liability accounts listed (like long-term liabilities).\n\n- **Total Assets**: This is clearly listed as \"Total Assets\" with an \"End_amount\" of 14,214,117.02.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nGiven:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51\n- Total Assets = 14,214,117.02\n\nNow, plug these into the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{378,850.51}{14,214,117.02} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ \\frac{378,850.51}{14,214,117.02} \\approx 0.02665 \\]\n\nRounding this to two decimal places (as in the example), we get approximately 0.03.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the example provided:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,861,550.92\n- Total Assets = 13,216,409.49\n- Ratio calculated was 0.14\n\nCalculating:\n\\[ \\frac{1,861,550.92}{13,216,409.49} \\approx 0.1409 \\]\nWhich rounds to 0.14, matching the given solution.\n\nThis confirms that we're on the right track by using \"Total Current Liabilities\" as \"Total Liabilities\" in the absence of other liability accounts.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nSo, for our problem:\n\\[ \\frac{378,850.51}{14,214,117.02} \\approx 0.02665 \\]\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.03\n\n### Potential Missteps\n\nI initially wondered if there might be other liabilities not listed, but since the example only used \"Total Current Liabilities\" and no other liabilities were present in either the example or the problem, it's safe to assume that's the total debt for this calculation.\n\nAlso, ensuring that we're using the \"End_amount\" figures is crucial because we're calculating the ratio as of the end of the reporting period (2024-02-05 in this case).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully going through the numbers and verifying with the example, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.03.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03'} }\n```",
