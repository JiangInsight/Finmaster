                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand where each number comes from in the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all revenue is credit sales since no cash sales are mentioned): Main Business Revenue = 2,637,011.03\n- Accounts Receivable at the beginning of the period (Initial_amount): 0.00\n- Accounts Receivable at the end of the period (End_amount): 2,117,339.65\n\n**Average Accounts Receivable:**  \n(Initial_amount + End_amount) / 2 = (0 + 2,117,339.65) / 2 = 1,058,669.825\n\n**Calculation:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 2,637,011.03 / 1,058,669.825 ≈ 2.49\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio was calculated differently. The example had:\n\nNet Credit Sales = 5,431,018.59  \nAverage Accounts Receivable = (0 + 2,429,482.13) / 2 = 1,214,741.065  \nRatio = 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 ≈ 4.47\n\nSo, following the same method here, it's 2.49.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\n**Given:**\n- Operating Cash Flow (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities): -1,028,375.55\n- Current Liabilities (Total Current Liabilities at end): 378,850.51\n\n**Calculation:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 ≈ -2.71\n\n*Checking the example:*\nOperating Cash Flow = -7,259,994.10  \nCurrent Liabilities = 1,861,550.92  \nRatio = -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.90\n\nSo, method seems correct.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis seems identical to the Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the example provided (both were -3.90 in the example). So, same calculation:\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 ≈ -2.71\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Sales (Total Revenue): 2,637,011.03\n- Total Assets at beginning (Initial_amount): 13,000,000.00\n- Total Assets at end (End_amount): 14,214,117.02\n\n**Average Total Assets:**  \n(13,000,000.00 + 14,214,117.02) / 2 = 13,607,058.51\n\n**Calculation:**  \nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = 2,637,011.03 / 13,607,058.51 ≈ 0.19\n\n*Checking the example:*\nNet Sales = 5,431,018.59  \nAverage Total Assets = (13,000,000 + 13,216,409.49) / 2 = 13,108,204.745  \nRatio = 5,431,018.59 / 13,108,204.745 ≈ 0.41\n\nSo, method seems correct.\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\n**Given:**\n- Total Liabilities (Total Current Liabilities at end, since no long-term liabilities are listed): 378,850.51\n- Total Shareholders' Equity (Total Owner's Equity at end): 13,835,266.51\n\n**Calculation:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = 378,850.51 / 13,835,266.51 ≈ 0.027\n\n*Checking the example:*\nTotal Liabilities = 1,861,550.92  \nTotal Owner's Equity = 11,354,858.57  \nRatio = 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.16\n\nHmm, in the example, it seems they might have included more liabilities if available, but here only current liabilities are given. So, assuming only current liabilities are total liabilities, the ratio is 0.027, which seems very low. Maybe I'm missing something, but based on the data, that's the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" is 14,214,117.02 and Owner's Equity is 13,835,266.51, then Total Liabilities = Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity - Owner's Equity = 14,214,117.02 - 13,835,266.51 = 378,850.51, which matches the current liabilities. So, seems correct.\n\nBut the example had a higher ratio, maybe because more liabilities were present. Here, it's just current liabilities.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.49', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-2.71', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.71', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.19', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03'}}\n```\n\n*Note:* The Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.027, which rounds to 0.03. Other ratios are as calculated above. \n\nHowever, looking back at the example's Debt to Equity Ratio (0.16), it seems they might have included more liabilities, but in this problem, only current liabilities are provided, leading to a much lower ratio. If there are no other liabilities, then 0.03 is correct based on the given data.\n\nSimilarly, the Total Asset Turnover Ratio is lower here (0.19 vs. 0.41 in the example) because the revenue is lower relative to the asset base.\n\nThe Operating Cash Flow ratios are negative in both cases, indicating negative operating cash flows relative to current liabilities.\n\nThe Accounts Receivable Turnover is lower here (2.49 vs. 4.47), meaning receivables are turning over less frequently in this scenario compared to the example.",
