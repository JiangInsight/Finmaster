                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the four requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities listed) = 378,850.51\n- Total Owner's Equity = 13,835,266.51\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 378,850.51 / 13,835,266.51 ≈ 0.0274\n\nBut looking at the example, it seems they might have considered more liabilities if available. Here, only current liabilities are given, so we'll proceed with that.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:**  \nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 835,266.51\n- Total Revenue = 2,637,011.03\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (835,266.51 / 2,637,011.03) * 100 ≈ 31.68%\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:**  \nROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets = 14,214,117.02\n- Net Profit = 835,266.51\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (835,266.51 / 14,214,117.02) * 100 ≈ 5.88%\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since we don't have info on cash sales), Net Credit Sales = Total Revenue = 2,637,011.03\n\nFor Average Accounts Receivable:\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable (from initial balance sheet) = 0.00\n- Ending Accounts Receivable = 2,117,339.65\nAverage = (0 + 2,117,339.65) / 2 = 1,058,669.825\n\nCalculation:\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 2,637,011.03 / 1,058,669.825 ≈ 2.49\n\nHowever, if we consider that the initial accounts receivable is 0, and all receivables are from the current period, it might make more sense to use ending accounts receivable (as the average would be skewed by starting at 0). Alternatively, if we think that the initial is not zero but missing, we might need to adjust. Given the data, I'll stick with the above calculation.\n\nBut looking back at the example, they might have used ending accounts receivable directly if initial is zero. Let me try that:\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 2,637,011.03 / 2,117,339.65 ≈ 1.25\n\nThis seems more plausible because if initial is zero, the average is half of ending, which might not reflect the actual turnover well during the period. So, likely using ending AR is better here.\n\nBut the example used average, so to be consistent, I'll go with average.\n\nWait, in the example, initial AR was 0, end was 2,429,482.13, and they calculated:\n\nAR Turnover = 5,431,018.59 / ((0 + 2,429,482.13)/2) = 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 ≈ 4.47\n\nSo, following that, for our case:\n\nAR Turnover = 2,637,011.03 / ((0 + 2,117,339.65)/2) = 2,637,011.03 / 1,058,669.825 ≈ 2.49\n\nBut the initial AR is zero, which might not be realistic, but given the data, that's what we have.\n\n### Final Calculations:\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 378,850.51 / 13,835,266.51 ≈ 0.027 (or 0.03 rounded)\n- Net Profit Margin: (835,266.51 / 2,637,011.03) * 100 ≈ 31.68%\n- ROA: (835,266.51 / 14,214,117.02) * 100 ≈ 5.88%\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: 2,637,011.03 / 1,058,669.825 ≈ 2.49\n\nBut looking at the example's formatting, they seem to round to two decimal places and sometimes represent as percentages where appropriate. So:\n\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: '0.03'\n- Net Profit Margin: '31.68%'\n- ROA: '5.88%'\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: '2.49'\n\nHowever, the example had Debt to Equity as '0.16', which is higher, maybe they included more liabilities. Here, we only have current liabilities, so maybe it's correct as is.\n\nSimilarly, the example's AR turnover was '4.47', which is higher, but their revenue was higher relative to AR.\n\nGiven that, here's the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.68%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '5.88%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.49'}}\n```\n\nBut let me double-check the Debt to Equity Ratio. Is there any other liability besides current liabilities? In the balance sheet provided, only \"Total Current Liabilities\" is listed under liabilities, which is 378,850.51. Owner's equity is 13,835,266.51. So the ratio is indeed ~0.027, rounded to '0.03'.\n\nSimilarly, for AR turnover, given initial AR is 0, the calculation is correct as 2.49.\n\nThus, the final answer is correct as above.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.68%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '5.88%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.49'}}\n```",
