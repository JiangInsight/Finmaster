                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one using the provided financial statements. I'll go through each calculation step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,028,375.55\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51\n\nCalculation:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 ≈ -2.71\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt\n\nFirst, we need to determine Total Debt. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities are:\n- Accounts Payable = 247,000.00\n- Taxes Payable = 131,850.51\nTotal Current Liabilities = 378,850.51 (which seems to be the total debt as there are no non-current liabilities listed)\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 ≈ -2.71\n\n*Note: This seems the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio because total debt equals current liabilities in this case.*\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 1,015,000.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Ending Inventory = 203,000.00\n- Initial Inventory (assuming it's zero since it's not provided but implied by the initial amount being zero) = 0.00\nAverage Inventory = (0 + 203,000) / 2 = 101,500.00\n\nCalculation:\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 1,015,000.00 / 101,500.00 ≈ 10.00\n\n*Wait a minute, the initial inventory is listed as 0.00 in the balance sheet, and the end inventory is 203,000. So average is (0 + 203,000)/2 = 101,500.*\n\nBut looking back at the example, the inventory turnover was calculated as COGS / End Inventory, not average. Maybe the initial inventory is not considered here. Let me check the example:\n\nIn the example:\nCOGS = 4,410,000\nEnd Inventory = 5,090,000\nInventory Turnover = 4,410,000 / 5,090,000 ≈ 0.87, but the given solution is 1.73, which is COGS / Average Inventory (assuming initial is zero): 4,410,000 / (0 + 5,090,000)/2 ≈ 1.73.\n\nSo, using average inventory is correct.\n\nThus:\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 1,015,000 / 101,500 = 10.00\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (Total Debt) = 378,850.51\n- Total Owner's Equity = 13,835,266.51\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 378,850.51 / 13,835,266.51 ≈ 0.027\n\nBut in the example, it was Total Current Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity = 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.16, which matches the given solution.\n\nSo here:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 378,850.51 / 13,835,266.51 ≈ 0.027\n\nBut let's check if \"Total Debt\" includes only current liabilities or all liabilities. Here, it seems only current liabilities are present, so it's 378,850.51.\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 9,221,098.50\n- Inventory = 203,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 378,850.51\n\nCalculation:\nQuick Ratio = (9,221,098.50 - 203,000.00) / 378,850.51 ≈ 9,018,098.50 / 378,850.51 ≈ 23.80\n\nThis seems unusually high. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me list all current assets:\n\nCash on Hand: 2,602,624.45  \nBank Deposits: 4,283,110.81  \nInterest Receivable: 15,023.59  \nAccounts Receivable: 2,117,339.65  \nInventory: 203,000.00  \nTotal Current Assets: 9,221,098.50\n\nQuick Assets = Total Current Assets - Inventory = 9,221,098.50 - 203,000 = 9,018,098.50\n\nQuick Ratio = 9,018,098.50 / 378,850.51 ≈ 23.80\n\nThis seems correct based on the numbers, but it's extremely high, which might indicate that current liabilities are very low compared to quick assets.\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nCurrent Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = 9,221,098.50\n- Current Liabilities = 378,850.51\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 9,221,098.50 / 378,850.51 ≈ 24.34\n\nAgain, this is very high, similar to the quick ratio, indicating strong liquidity.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the summary:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 ≈ -2.71\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: -1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 ≈ -2.71\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio: 1,015,000 / 101,500 = 10.00\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio: 378,850.51 / 13,835,266.51 ≈ 0.027 (or 0.03)\n5. Quick Ratio: (9,221,098.50 - 203,000) / 378,850.51 ≈ 23.80\n6. Current Ratio: 9,221,098.50 / 378,850.51 ≈ 24.34\n\nHowever, the Debt to Equity Ratio seems very low (0.027), and the Quick and Current Ratios are extremely high, which might be correct given the numbers but seems unusual. Maybe the \"Total Debt\" should include all liabilities, but here only current liabilities are present.\n\nGiven that, the ratios seem mathematically correct based on the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.71', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.71', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '10.00', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Quick Ratio': '23.80', 'Current Ratio': '24.34'}}\n```\n\n*Note: The high quick and current ratios are due to very low current liabilities compared to high current assets, which might be accurate based on the provided data.*",
