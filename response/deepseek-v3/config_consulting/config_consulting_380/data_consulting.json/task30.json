                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each ratio one by one using the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 9,221,098.50\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 378,850.51\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 9,221,098.50 / 378,850.51 ≈ 24.34\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand (End_amount) = 2,602,624.45\n- Bank Deposits (End_amount) = 4,283,110.81\n- Interest Receivable (End_amount) = 15,023.59\n- Accounts Receivable (End_amount) = 2,117,339.65\n- Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 2,602,624.45 + 4,283,110.81 + 15,023.59 + 2,117,339.65 ≈ 9,018,098.50\n\nQuick Ratio = 9,018,098.50 / 378,850.51 ≈ 23.80\n\n*Wait a minute, the quick ratio is higher than the current ratio, which shouldn't happen because the quick ratio excludes inventory, making it usually lower than the current ratio. Did I include too much in quick assets? Typically, \"quick assets\" are cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Interest receivable might not always be included unless it's readily convertible to cash. Maybe I should exclude interest receivable.*\n\nLet me recalculate without interest receivable:\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable\n= 2,602,624.45 + 4,283,110.81 + 2,117,339.65 ≈ 9,003,074.91\n\nQuick Ratio = 9,003,074.91 / 378,850.51 ≈ 23.76\n\nStill very high. Maybe bank deposits are considered cash equivalents, so this might be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the current ratio was miscalculated. But looking back, total current assets are indeed higher than quick assets because inventory is included in current assets but not in quick assets. Here, inventory is 203,000.00, so:\n\nTotal Current Assets = Quick Assets + Inventory\n9,221,098.50 ≈ 9,003,074.91 + 203,000.00 (close enough, slight rounding difference)\n\nSo the quick ratio is indeed higher than the current ratio, which is unusual but possible if inventory is a very small part of current assets, as in this case.\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since there are no non-current liabilities listed) = 378,850.51\n- Total Assets = 14,214,117.02\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 378,850.51 / 14,214,117.02 ≈ 0.0266 or 0.03 when rounded\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 378,850.51\n- Total Owner's Equity = 13,835,266.51\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 378,850.51 / 13,835,266.51 ≈ 0.027 or 0.03 when rounded\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,028,375.55\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 378,850.51\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -1,028,375.55 / 378,850.51 ≈ -2.71\n\n*This is negative, indicating that the company's operating cash flow is negative relative to its debt, which isn't a good sign.*\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '24.34', 'Quick Ratio': '23.76', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.71'}}\n```\n\n*Wait, looking back at the example provided, the current and quick ratios were much lower (4.27 and 1.54 respectively), and here mine are much higher. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the data. Let me double-check the current liabilities.*\n\nIn the example, total current liabilities were 1,861,550.92, leading to lower ratios. Here, total current liabilities are only 378,850.51, which is much smaller compared to current assets, hence the higher ratios. So my calculations seem correct based on the given data. The company in this problem has very low current liabilities relative to current assets, leading to high liquidity ratios.\n\nSimilarly, debt ratios are very low because total liabilities are small compared to assets and equity. The cash flow to debt is negative because operating cash flow is negative, which is consistent with the data.\n\nThus, the final ratios are correctly calculated based on the provided financial statements.",
