                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Equity Ratio\nFirst, I need to understand what the Debt to Equity Ratio is. From what I know, it's a financial ratio that compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholders' equity. It's a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations through debt versus wholly owned funds.\n\nThe formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\n### Identifying the Components from the Balance Sheet\nNow, let's look at the given balance sheet to find the necessary components:\n\n1. **Total Liabilities**: \n   - From the balance sheet, under \"Total Current Liabilities\", the end amount is 378,850.51.\n   - There's no mention of long-term liabilities, so it seems the total liabilities are just the current liabilities, which is 378,850.51.\n\n2. **Total Shareholders' Equity**:\n   - Under \"Total Owner's Equity\", the end amount is 13,835,266.51.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{378,850.51}{13,835,266.51} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{378,850.51}{13,835,266.51} \\approx 0.02738 \\]\n\nRounding this to two decimal places gives us approximately 0.03.\n\n### Verifying the Components\nJust to make sure I didn't miss anything:\n- Are there any other liabilities besides \"Total Current Liabilities\"? The balance sheet doesn't list any long-term liabilities, so it seems correct to use just the current liabilities.\n- \"Total Owner's Equity\" is clearly given as 13,835,266.51, which includes paid-in capital and retained earnings.\n\n### Final Answer\nSo, the Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.03 when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the ratio was given as '0.16', which was calculated as Total Current Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity (1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.16). Following the same approach here:\n\n378,850.51 / 13,835,266.51 ≈ 0.02738, which rounds to 0.03.\n\nBut to match the precision in the example (two decimal places), we'll present it as '0.03'.\n\n### Possible Missteps\nInitially, I wondered if \"Total Liabilities\" includes both current and non-current liabilities, but since only current liabilities are provided, it's safe to assume that's the total. Also, sometimes \"Debt\" might refer to interest-bearing liabilities, but here all current liabilities are considered as debt for this ratio.\n\n### Final JSON Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03'} }\n```",
