                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate both the Current Ratio and the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n\n**Definition:** The Current Ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its current assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Assets (End_amount):** 9,221,098.50\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 378,850.51\n\nNow, plug in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{9,221,098.50}{378,850.51} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{9,221,098.50}{378,850.51} \\approx 24.34 \\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems quite high. Let me double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't misread anything.\n\nLooking back:\n- Current Assets: 9,221,098.50 (includes Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, Accounts Receivable, Inventory)\n- Current Liabilities: 378,850.51 (Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable)\n\nYes, the calculation seems correct. The Current Ratio is indeed approximately 24.34. This suggests the company has a very high level of current assets relative to its current liabilities, indicating strong short-term financial health.\n\n### 2. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\n**Definition:** The Inventory Turnover Ratio measures how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need the **Average Inventory**. Since we have the beginning and ending inventory:\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Initial Inventory (Initial_amount):** 0.00\n- **Ending Inventory (End_amount):** 203,000.00\n\nAverage Inventory is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{0 + 203,000}{2} = 101,500 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** 1,015,000.00\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{1,015,000}{101,500} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,015,000}{101,500} = 10 \\]\n\nSo, the Inventory Turnover Ratio is 10. This means the company turns over its inventory 10 times during the period, which is quite efficient.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the provided example to ensure I'm doing this correctly:\n\nExample's Current Ratio:\n- Current Assets: 7,956,806.47\n- Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\n- Ratio: 7,956,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 4.27 (matches given solution)\n\nExample's Inventory Turnover:\n- COGS: 4,410,000\n- Beginning Inventory: 0\n- Ending Inventory: 5,090,000\n- Average Inventory: (0 + 5,090,000)/2 = 2,545,000\n- Ratio: 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73 (matches given solution)\n\nMy calculations seem to follow the same method, so I believe they're correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '24.34', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '10.00'} }\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example's formatting, the ratios were given with two decimal places. So, I'll present the Current Ratio as '24.34' and the Inventory Turnover as '10.00'.\n\nBut wait, the Inventory Turnover is exactly 10, so '10.00' is appropriate. Similarly, '24.34' is precise enough for the Current Ratio.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '24.34', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '10.00'} }\n```",
