                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested metrics based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nFree Cash Flow is typically calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} - \\text{Capital Expenditures} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -1,028,375.55\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (Capital Expenditures): 85,889.19\n\nBut looking at the example, it seems they've taken the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents as FCF, which is -1,114,264.74. This might be a simplified approach where FCF is the net change in cash position.\n\nSo, \n\\[ \\text{FCF} = -1,114,264.74 \\]\n\n### 2. Return on Assets (ROA)\nROA is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate Average Total Assets:\n\\[ \\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Total Assets} + \\text{Ending Total Assets}}{2} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{13,000,000 + 14,214,117.02}{2} = \\frac{27,214,117.02}{2} = 13,607,058.51 \\]\n\nNet Income (from income statement): 835,266.51\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\frac{835,266.51}{13,607,058.51} \\times 100 \\approx 6.14\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Return on Equity (ROE)\nROE is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Average Shareholders' Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nCalculate Average Shareholders' Equity:\n\\[ \\text{Average Equity} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Equity} + \\text{Ending Equity}}{2} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{13,000,000 + 13,835,266.51}{2} = \\frac{26,835,266.51}{2} = 13,417,633.255 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{835,266.51}{13,417,633.255} \\times 100 \\approx 6.22\\% \\]\n\n*Wait a minute, the ending equity is 13,835,266.51? Actually, looking back, the ending Total Owner's Equity is 13,835,266.51 (Paid-in Capital + Retained Earnings). So the calculation seems correct.*\n\n### 4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\nThis is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}} \\]\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -1,028,375.55\nNet Income: 835,266.51\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-1,028,375.55}{835,266.51} \\approx -1.23 \\]\n\nThis negative ratio indicates that the operating cash flow is negative while net income is positive, which might be unusual but possible due to significant increases in working capital (like accounts receivable).\n\n### 5. Net Profit Margin\nNet Profit Margin is:\n\\[ \\text{Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nNet Income: 835,266.51\nTotal Revenue: 2,637,011.03\n\n\\[ \\text{Margin} = \\frac{835,266.51}{2,637,011.03} \\times 100 \\approx 31.68\\% \\]\n\n### 6. Gross Profit Margin\nGross Profit Margin is:\n\\[ \\text{Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nGross Profit: 1,622,011.03\nTotal Revenue: 2,637,011.03\n\n\\[ \\text{Margin} = \\frac{1,622,011.03}{2,637,011.03} \\times 100 \\approx 61.51\\% \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-1114264.74', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '6.14%', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '6.22%', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-1.23', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.68%', 'Gross Profit Margin': '61.51%'} }\n```\n\n*Reviewing the calculations:*\n- FCF: Used net increase in cash, which matches the example's approach.\n- ROA and ROE: Used average assets and equity, which is standard.\n- Operating Cash Flow to Net Income: Negative due to negative operating cash flow despite positive net income.\n- Margins: Calculated correctly based on given figures.\n\nEverything checks out!",
