                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate two ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Asset Ratio and the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Liabilities (End_amount for Total Current Liabilities): 378,850.51\n- Total Assets (End_amount for Total Assets): 14,214,117.02\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{378,850.51}{14,214,117.02} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n378,850.51 ÷ 14,214,117.02 ≈ 0.02665\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.03\n\nWait a minute, but in the example provided, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated as '0.14'. Let me double-check if I'm looking at the right numbers.\n\nLooking back at the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities: 378,850.51\n- There's no mention of long-term liabilities, so total liabilities are just the current liabilities.\n- Total Assets: 14,214,117.02\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct. Maybe the example had more liabilities. \n\nBut in our case, it's:\n378,850.51 / 14,214,117.02 ≈ 0.02665 or 0.03 when rounded.\n\nBut to match the format, let's keep it to two decimal places as in the example.\n\nSo, '0.03'.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the operating cash flow to the net income, showing how much cash is generated from operations relative to reported earnings. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -1,028,375.55\n- Net Profit: 835,266.51\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-1,028,375.55}{835,266.51} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n-1,028,375.55 ÷ 835,266.51 ≈ -1.231\n\nWait, this is negative, but in the example, the ratio was positive ('4.41'). \n\nLooking back at the example:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,259,994.10\n- Net Profit: -1,645,141.43\n- Ratio: -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41 (negative divided by negative is positive)\n\nIn our case, it's negative divided by positive, so the ratio is negative: -1.23.\n\nBut the example shows a positive ratio when both numbers are negative. Maybe we should take absolute values?\n\nBut the standard formula is just operating cash flow divided by net income, preserving the signs.\n\nGiven that, our ratio is -1.23.\n\nBut let's see the numbers:\n\nOperating Cash Flow: -1,028,375.55\nNet Income: 835,266.51\n\nSo, -1,028,375.55 / 835,266.51 = -1.231\n\nRounding to two decimal places: -1.23\n\nBut in the example, both were negative, resulting in positive. Here, one is negative, one is positive, so negative ratio.\n\nIs that correct? Yes, mathematically, negative divided by positive is negative.\n\nBut is this ratio usually presented as absolute? Maybe. Let me think.\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is typically used to see if earnings are being converted to cash. A negative ratio could indicate that despite positive earnings, cash flow from operations is negative, which might be a concern.\n\nSo, presenting it as -1.23 seems correct.\n\nBut in the example, both were negative, and the ratio was positive. \n\nIn our case, it's negative. Maybe the company is in a different situation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is absolute values, but standard is to keep signs.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with -1.23.\n\nBut looking at the example, their operating cash flow was -7,259,994.10, net profit was -1,645,141.43, ratio was 4.41 (which is -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43).\n\nSo, same signs give positive ratio, different signs give negative.\n\nThus, our answer is -1.23.\n\nBut let's check the calculation again:\n\n-1,028,375.55 / 835,266.51:\n\n1,028,375.55 / 835,266.51 ≈ 1.231\n\nSo, -1.231 or -1.23.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-1.23'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me verify the calculations quickly.\n\n1. Debt to Asset Ratio:\n   - Total Liabilities: 378,850.51\n   - Total Assets: 14,214,117.02\n   - 378,850.51 / 14,214,117.02 ≈ 0.02665 ≈ 0.03\n\n2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -1,028,375.55\n   - Net Income: 835,266.51\n   - -1,028,375.55 / 835,266.51 ≈ -1.231 ≈ -1.23\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-1.23'}}\n```",
