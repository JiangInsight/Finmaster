                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the required ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount): 9,221,098.50\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount): 378,850.51\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 9,221,098.50 / 378,850.51 ≈ 24.34\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n**Formula:** (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit: 1,622,011.03\n- Total Revenue: 2,637,011.03\n\nCalculation:\nGross Profit Margin = (1,622,011.03 / 2,637,011.03) * 100 ≈ 61.51%\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities: Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51 (since no non-current liabilities are listed)\n- Total Assets: 14,214,117.02\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 378,850.51 / 14,214,117.02 ≈ 0.0267 or 2.67%\n\nWait a minute, in the example provided, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated using Total Current Liabilities / Total Assets, but traditionally, it's Total Liabilities / Total Assets. Here, since only current liabilities are present, it's fine. But let's confirm:\n\nTotal Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 378,850.51\nTotal Assets = 14,214,117.02\n\nSo, Debt to Asset Ratio = 378,850.51 / 14,214,117.02 ≈ 0.0267 or 2.67%\n\nBut in the example, it seems they might have included something else. Maybe I'm missing non-current liabilities. Looking back at the balance sheet, under liabilities, only current liabilities are listed, so it's correct.\n\n### 4. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:** (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit: 835,266.51\n- Total Revenue: 2,637,011.03\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (835,266.51 / 2,637,011.03) * 100 ≈ 31.68%\n\n### 5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand (End_amount): 2,602,624.45\n- Bank Deposits (End_amount): 4,283,110.81\n- Total Cash and Cash Equivalents = 2,602,624.45 + 4,283,110.81 = 6,885,735.26\n- Current Liabilities: 378,850.51\n\nCalculation:\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = 6,885,735.26 / 378,850.51 ≈ 18.18\n\n### 6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nFrom the cash flow statement, Free Cash Flow is typically calculated as:\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -1,028,375.55\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 85,889.19\n\nBut usually, FCF is Operating Cash Flow minus CapEx, but here Operating Cash Flow is already net. Alternatively, sometimes it's the net increase in cash and cash equivalents, which is given as -1,114,264.74.\n\nLooking at the example, they used the \"Net Increase\" from the cash flow statement as FCF. So:\n\nFree Cash Flow = Net Increase = -1,114,264.74\n\n### 7. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:** (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit: 835,266.51\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets (End_amount): 14,214,117.02\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (835,266.51 / 14,214,117.02) * 100 ≈ 5.88%\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '24.34', 'Gross Profit Margin': '61.51%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '2.67%', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.68%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '18.18', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-1114264.74', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '5.88%'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me quickly verify the calculations:\n\n1. Current Ratio: 9,221,098.50 / 378,850.51 ≈ 24.34 ✔\n2. Gross Profit Margin: (1,622,011.03 / 2,637,011.03) * 100 ≈ 61.51% ✔\n3. Debt to Asset Ratio: 378,850.51 / 14,214,117.02 ≈ 0.0267 or 2.67% ✔\n4. Net Profit Margin: (835,266.51 / 2,637,011.03) * 100 ≈ 31.68% ✔\n5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio: 6,885,735.26 / 378,850.51 ≈ 18.18 ✔\n6. Free Cash Flow: -1,114,264.74 (from net increase) ✔\n7. ROA: (835,266.51 / 14,214,117.02) * 100 ≈ 5.88% ✔\n\nEverything checks out!",
