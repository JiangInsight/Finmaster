                        "content": "To calculate the Cash to Current Debt Ratio, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Cash and Cash Equivalents**: This includes \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" from the balance sheet.\n2. **Identify Current Liabilities**: This is the \"Total Current Liabilities\" from the balance sheet.\n3. **Calculate the Ratio**: The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash to Current Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\nFrom the given balance sheet:\n- **Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n  - Cash on Hand: 2,602,624.45\n  - Bank Deposits: 4,283,110.81\n  - Total Cash and Cash Equivalents = 2,602,624.45 + 4,283,110.81 = 6,885,735.26\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 378,850.51\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash to Current Debt Ratio} = \\frac{6,885,735.26}{378,850.51} \\approx 18.18\n\\]\n\nHowever, the ratio is typically expressed as a decimal or a percentage, so we can round it to two decimal places:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash to Current Debt Ratio} \\approx 18.18\n\\]\n\nBut in the example provided, the ratio was given as a decimal (0.23), so it's possible the expectation is to divide by 100 or there might be a misunderstanding. Given the numbers, the correct calculation is 18.18, but if we consider the example, it might be expected to present it as a decimal (e.g., 0.18). \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll present the raw calculation:\n\\[\n\\frac{6,885,735.26}{378,850.51} \\approx 18.18\n\\]\n\nBut if the expectation is to present it as a decimal (like the example), it would be 18.18. However, the example had a much smaller ratio, so perhaps there's a different interpretation. \n\nGiven the numbers, the correct ratio is 18.18, but if the task expects a decimal, it might be 18.18. \n\nGiven the confusion, I'll stick to the raw calculation:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash to Current Debt Ratio} = \\frac{6,885,735.26}{378,850.51} \\approx 18.18\n\\]\n\nBut in the example, the ratio was less than 1, so perhaps the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" is only the ending balance from the cash flow statement (6,885,735.26), and the current liabilities are 378,850.51, so:\n\\[\n\\frac{6,885,735.26}{378,850.51} \\approx 18.18\n\\]\n\nThis seems correct based on the data. \n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '18.18'}}\n```",
