In the given problem, it is `-1,028,375.55`.\n\n2. **Identify the Total Debt**: The total debt is the sum of all liabilities. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are under \"Total Current Liabilities\", which is `378,850.51`. There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so the total debt is `378,850.51`.\n\n3. **Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the numbers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-1,028,375.55}{378,850.51} \\approx -2.71\n   \\]\n\n4. **Present the Answer**: The ratio is rounded to two decimal places.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.71'} }\n```",
