                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio based on the given cash flow statement. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\" is. From what I know, this ratio compares the cash generated from operating activities to the net income reported by the company. It's a measure of how well a company can turn its profits into cash.\n\nThe formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\n### Identifying the Given Values\n\nLooking at the provided data:\n\n1. **Net Profit**: This is given as 835,266.51.\n2. **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: This is given as -1,028,375.55.\n\nWait a minute, in the example provided, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities was -7,259,994.10, and Net Profit was -1,645,141.43, and the ratio was 4.41. \n\nCalculating that:\n\\[ \\frac{-7,259,994.10}{-1,645,141.43} \\approx 4.41 \\]\nThat checks out with the given solution.\n\nSo, similarly, for our problem:\n\\[ \\frac{-1,028,375.55}{835,266.51} \\]\n\n### Performing the Calculation\n\nNow, let's do the math:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-1,028,375.55}{835,266.51} \\approx -1.231 \\]\n\nBut the ratio in the example was positive despite both numbers being negative. Maybe the absolute value is considered? \n\nLooking back at the example, both numbers were negative, resulting in a positive ratio. So, the ratio is the absolute value of the division.\n\nSo, absolute value:\n\\[ \\left| \\frac{-1,028,375.55}{835,266.51} \\right| \\approx 1.231 \\]\n\nBut the example had both numbers negative, and the ratio was positive. Here, one is negative, and one is positive, resulting in a negative ratio. \n\nIs the ratio supposed to be positive? Maybe the sign indicates something about the quality of earnings, but typically, ratios are presented as positive numbers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is supposed to be positive in the formula, but here it's negative. \n\nWait, in the example, both were negative, and the ratio was positive. Here, one is positive, one is negative, so the ratio is negative. \n\nIs that acceptable? Maybe the ratio can be negative, indicating that operating cash flow is opposite in sign to net income, which could be a red flag. \n\nBut the ratio is usually expressed as a positive number, so perhaps we take the absolute value. \n\nGiven that the example had both negative and the ratio was positive, here one is negative, one is positive, so ratio is negative. \n\nBut the ratio is a measure of how much cash is generated per unit of net income. A negative ratio would imply that for positive net income, cash flow is negative, which is unusual but possible. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to divide the absolute values:\n\n\\[ \\frac{| \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} |}{| \\text{Net Profit} |} \\]\n\nBut in the example:\n\\[ \\frac{|-7,259,994.10|}{|-1,645,141.43|} = \\frac{7,259,994.10}{1,645,141.43} \\approx 4.41 \\]\nWhich matches.\n\nSo for our case:\n\\[ \\frac{| -1,028,375.55 |}{| 835,266.51 |} = \\frac{1,028,375.55}{835,266.51} \\approx 1.231 \\]\n\nBut the sign is important. Maybe the ratio is supposed to preserve the sign to indicate the relationship between cash flow and net income. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is always:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\nAnd we report the signed value. \n\nIn the example, both were negative, so positive ratio. Here, one negative, one positive, so negative ratio. \n\nBut is a negative ratio meaningful? \n\nPerhaps the ratio is always positive, and we take the absolute value of both numerator and denominator. \n\nGiven that the example had both negative and the ratio was positive, and here one is negative, one is positive, the ratio is negative, but maybe we report the absolute value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is always positive, and the signs indicate adjustments, but the ratio magnitude is what's important. \n\nGiven that, I think the correct approach is to divide the absolute values to get a positive ratio, as in the example. \n\nSo:\n\\[ \\frac{1,028,375.55}{835,266.51} \\approx 1.231 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 1.23\n\nBut the example had two decimal places, so we'll do the same.\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nLet me verify:\n\n1,028,375.55 / 835,266.51 ≈ 1.231\n\nSo, approximately 1.23.\n\nBut the example had 4.41, which was -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 = 4.41 (positive because negative divided by negative is positive).\n\nHere, negative divided by positive is negative, but if we take absolute values, it's positive. \n\nGiven that, and since the ratio is a measure of how much cash is generated relative to income, the magnitude is probably what's important, so we can report the absolute value.\n\nThus, the ratio is 1.23.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '1.23'}}\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the ratio was exactly as the division came out, preserving the sign in the sense that two negatives made a positive. Here, negative divided by positive is negative, but the ratio is typically a positive measure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is always positive, calculated as:\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = |Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit|\n\nIn which case, here it would be | -1.231 | = 1.231 ≈ 1.23.\n\nGiven that, and the example, I think the correct answer is 1.23.\n\nBut the example had both negative, so positive ratio. Here, one negative, one positive, so negative ratio, but we might report the absolute value.\n\nGiven that, and since the ratio is a measure of the magnitude, the answer is likely the absolute value.\n\nThus:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '1.23'}}\n```",
