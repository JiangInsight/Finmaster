The inconsistency likely arose from a data entry error where the quantity and amount were mistakenly recorded as 0.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Other fields (e.g., payment method, supplier, product) are consistent with the invoice and do not require correction.\n- The risk issue was already flagged in the original data (`{'Original quantity': 1.0, 'Recorded quantity': 0, 'id': 'Purchase20231231005'}`), confirming the inconsistency. \n\nThe solution focuses on the key fields that need correction while preserving the rest of the transaction details.",
