First, I'll look at transaction \"Purchase20231231006\" which has risk issues noted:\n- Original date: 2023-12-31 vs Recorded date: 2024-01-30 (date mismatch)\n- Original amount: 40000.0 vs Recorded amount: 44832.96 (amount mismatch)\n- Original price: 20000.0 vs Recorded price: 16274.12 (price mismatch)\n\n2. Looking at the invoice description:\n- It states 2 units at $20,000 totaling $40,000 (matches original)\n- But recorded shows 2 units at $16,274.12 totaling $44,832.96 (inconsistent)\n\n3. The correct values should be:\n- Date: 2023-12-31 (from invoice)\n- Unit price: $20,000 (from invoice)\n- Amount: $40,000 (2 Ã— $20,000)\n- Other fields match what's recorded\n\n4. The inconsistency appears to be a recording error where the unit price and total amount don't match the invoice description.\n\nHere's the solution in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"Original category\": \"Purchase\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Purchase\",\n    \"Original date\": \"2023-12-31\",\n    \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-30\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n    \"Original payment_method\": \"Bank Transfer\",\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Bank Transfer\",\n    \"Original quantity\": \"2.0\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"2.0\",\n    \"Original price\": \"20000.0\",\n    \"Recorded price\": \"16274.12\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"\",\n    \"Original amount\": \"40000.0\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"44832.96\",\n    \"Original tax\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded tax\": \"\",\n    \"Original profit\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded profit\": \"\",\n    \"Original Preparer\": \"Supervisor\",\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": \"Supervisor\",\n    \"Original Approver\": \"Director\",\n    \"Recorded Approver\": \"Director\",\n    \"id\": \"Purchase20231231006\"\n}}\n```",
