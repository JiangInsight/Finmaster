The recorded category is \"Sales Expenses\" but the invoice clearly describes it as a \"Sale\"\n2. The recorded date is \"2024-02-13\" but invoice says \"January 17, 2024\"\n3. The recorded amount is $14,658.35 but invoice says $12,808.07\n4. The recorded tax is $10,082.71 but invoice says $640.40\n5. The recorded price is $11,576.91 but invoice says $12,808.07\n\nHere's the solution in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\",\n    \"Original date\": \"2024-01-17\",\n    \"Recorded date\": \"2024-02-13\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n    \"Original payment_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n    \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"1.0\",\n    \"Original price\": \"12808.07\",\n    \"Recorded price\": \"11576.91\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n    \"Original amount\": \"12808.07\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"14658.35\",\n    \"Original tax\": \"640.40\",\n    \"Recorded tax\": \"10082.71\",\n    \"Original profit\": \"7808.07\",\n    \"Recorded profit\": null,\n    \"Original Preparer\": null,\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n    \"Original Approver\": null,\n    \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240117032\"\n}}\n```\n\nThe inconsistencies were identified by comparing the invoice description with the recorded fields. The invoice is considered the authoritative source, so any discrepancies indicate errors in the recorded fields that should be corrected to match the invoice details.",
