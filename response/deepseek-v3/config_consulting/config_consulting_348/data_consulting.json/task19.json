                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Current Ratio and the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: This measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its current assets. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: This shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n   \\]\n   Since we only have the ending inventory (no beginning inventory other than zero), we'll use the ending inventory as the average inventory for this calculation.\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet** (as of 2024-02-05):\n\n- **Total Current Assets**: 9,625,738.03\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 628,478.02\n- **Inventory (Ending)**: 112,000.00\n\nFrom the **income statement** (for the period ending 2024-02-05):\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 1,249,000.00\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{9,625,738.03}{628,478.02}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9,625,738.03}{628,478.02} \\approx 15.32\n\\]\n\nSo, the Current Ratio is approximately **15.32**.\n\n### Calculating the Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\nSince the beginning inventory is 0 (from the initial amount on 2023-12-31) and the ending inventory is 112,000.00, the average inventory is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2} = \\frac{0 + 112,000}{2} = 56,000\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} = \\frac{1,249,000}{56,000}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1,249,000}{56,000} \\approx 22.30\n\\]\n\nSo, the Inventory Turnover Ratio is approximately **22.30**.\n\nHowever, looking back at the initial example, the Inventory Turnover was calculated using the ending inventory directly (not averaging), likely because the beginning inventory was zero. If we follow that approach:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Ending Inventory}} = \\frac{1,249,000}{112,000} \\approx 11.15\n\\]\n\nBut in the example, even with beginning inventory as zero, they seemed to have used a non-zero average (perhaps considering purchases during the period). Given that in our case, beginning inventory is zero and ending is 112,000, and if no additional purchases are given, using ending inventory might be more appropriate here, leading to ~11.15.\n\nBut to match the example's method where they likely had a similar scenario (beginning inventory zero, ending non-zero), and they got a ratio higher than 1, it's possible they used ending inventory directly. But their COGS was much higher relative to inventory, leading to a higher ratio.\n\nGiven that in our case, COGS is 1,249,000 and ending inventory is 112,000, the ratio is ~11.15, which seems high but possible if inventory is very efficiently managed.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the initial inventory was zero and all inventory was purchased during the period, then average inventory is (0 + ending)/2 = ending/2, leading to higher turnover (22.30), which seems extremely high.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and the example's approach where beginning was zero and they likely used ending inventory, I'll proceed with:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Ending Inventory}} = \\frac{1,249,000}{112,000} \\approx 11.15\n\\]\n\nBut looking back at the example:\n\nTheir COGS was 4,410,000, ending inventory was 5,090,000, and they got 1.73, which is COGS/ending inventory = 4,410,000/5,090,000 ≈ 0.87, which doesn't match their 1.73. So they must have used average inventory where beginning was zero, ending was 5,090,000, so average was 2,545,000, then 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73.\n\nSo applying the same method here:\n\nAverage inventory = (0 + 112,000)/2 = 56,000\n\nInventory Turnover = 1,249,000 / 56,000 ≈ 22.30\n\nThis seems extremely high, but mathematically correct based on the data. Maybe the company sold almost all inventory purchased during the period.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\n- **Current Ratio**: 15.32\n- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: 22.30\n\nBut given that in the example, with beginning inventory zero, they used average inventory (ending/2), leading to a more reasonable turnover, I'll stick with that method.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '15.32', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '22.30'}}\n```\n\nHowever, considering that in the example, the Inventory Turnover was calculated as COGS / ((Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory)/2), and here Beginning Inventory is 0, Ending is 112,000, so average is 56,000, then:\n\n1,249,000 / 56,000 ≈ 22.30\n\nThis seems correct based on the method. The high ratio suggests very efficient inventory management or possibly that the inventory levels are very low compared to sales.\n\nThus, the final ratios are:\n\n- Current Ratio: 15.32\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio: 22.30\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '15.32', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '22.30'}}\n```\n\n**Note**: The Inventory Turnover Ratio is unusually high, which might indicate that the ending inventory is very small compared to the cost of goods sold, possibly due to just starting with inventory or extremely efficient turnover. If there's additional context or data suggesting a different interpretation, the ratio might be adjusted accordingly. But based on the given data and the method used in the example, this is the correct calculation.",
