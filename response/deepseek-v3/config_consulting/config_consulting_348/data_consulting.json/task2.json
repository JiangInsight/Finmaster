                        "content": "To calculate the Quick Ratio, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Quick Assets**: Quick assets are current assets that can be quickly converted into cash. These typically include:\n   - Cash on Hand\n   - Bank Deposits\n   - Interest Receivable\n   - Accounts Receivable\n   (Note: Inventory is excluded because it is not as liquid as the other current assets.)\n\n2. **Sum the Quick Assets**:\n   - Cash on Hand: 3,057,369.78\n   - Bank Deposits: 4,292,000.00\n   - Interest Receivable: 14,575.80\n   - Accounts Receivable: 2,149,792.45\n   Total Quick Assets = 3,057,369.78 + 4,292,000.00 + 14,575.80 + 2,149,792.45 = 9,513,738.03\n\n3. **Identify Current Liabilities**: These are liabilities that are due within one year. From the problem:\n   - Total Current Liabilities: 628,478.02\n\n4. **Calculate the Quick Ratio**:\n   Quick Ratio = Total Quick Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n   Quick Ratio = 9,513,738.03 / 628,478.02 â‰ˆ 15.14\n\n5. **Round the Result**: The Quick Ratio is typically rounded to two decimal places, so we get 15.14.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '15.14'} }\n```",
