                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Gross Profit Margin and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n\n### 1. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** Gross Profit Margin is a measure of a company's profitability and is calculated by dividing gross profit by total revenue. It shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS).\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 1,620,560.42\n- Total Revenue = 2,869,560.42\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,620,560.42}{2,869,560.42} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = 0.5647 \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} \\approx 56.47\\% \\]\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** The Operating Cash Flow Ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It's calculated by dividing operating cash flow by current liabilities.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -650,630.22 (negative value)\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end of period):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 628,478.02\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-650,630.22}{628,478.02} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} \\approx -1.035 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, let's present the answers in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '56.47%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.04'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n- Gross Profit Margin: 1,620,560.42 / 2,869,560.42 ≈ 0.5647 → 56.47% ✔\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -650,630.22 / 628,478.02 ≈ -1.035 → -1.04 (rounded to two decimal places) ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The negative Operating Cash Flow Ratio indicates that the company's operating cash flow is insufficient to cover its current liabilities, which could be a concern if this trend continues. On the other hand, a Gross Profit Margin of over 56% is quite healthy, indicating that the company retains a significant portion of revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold.",
