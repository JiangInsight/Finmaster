                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial task step by step. We need to calculate two key financial ratios: the Quick Ratio and the Net Profit Margin. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Quick Ratio (also known as the Acid-Test Ratio):**\n   - This measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n   - Formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n     \\]\n   - **Quick Assets** typically include:\n     - Cash and cash equivalents\n     - Marketable securities\n     - Accounts receivable\n   - **Excludes** inventory and other current assets that are not as liquid.\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - This shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue.\n   - Formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n     \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the provided financial statements, let's extract the necessary figures.\n\n#### Balance Sheet (End of Period - 2024-02-05):\n\n**Current Assets:**\n- Cash on Hand: 3,057,369.78\n- Bank Deposits: 4,292,000.00\n- Interest Receivable: 14,575.80\n- Accounts Receivable: 2,149,792.45\n- Inventory: 112,000.00\n- Total Current Assets: 9,625,738.03\n\n**Current Liabilities:**\n- Accounts Payable: 485,000.00\n- Taxes Payable: 143,478.02\n- Total Current Liabilities: 628,478.02\n\n#### Income Statement:\n\n- Total Revenue: 2,869,560.42\n- Net Profit: 905,750.76\n\n### Calculating Quick Ratio\n\n**Step 1: Identify Quick Assets**\nQuick assets are the most liquid current assets, excluding inventory. From the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand: 3,057,369.78\n- Bank Deposits: 4,292,000.00\n- Interest Receivable: 14,575.80\n- Accounts Receivable: 2,149,792.45\n\n*Note:* Some definitions may exclude \"Interest Receivable\" from quick assets, but it's generally considered a receivable that can be quickly converted to cash, similar to accounts receivable. For this calculation, I'll include it.\n\nTotal Quick Assets:\n= Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 3,057,369.78 + 4,292,000.00 + 14,575.80 + 2,149,792.45\n= 9,513,738.03\n\nWait a minute, this seems off because the Total Current Assets are 9,625,738.03, and we're excluding only inventory (112,000.00). \n\nLet me check:\nTotal Current Assets = Cash + Bank + Interest Rec. + Accts Rec. + Inventory\n9,625,738.03 = 3,057,369.78 + 4,292,000.00 + 14,575.80 + 2,149,792.45 + 112,000.00\nAdding the first four:\n3,057,369.78 + 4,292,000.00 = 7,349,369.78\n+ 14,575.80 = 7,363,945.58\n+ 2,149,792.45 = 9,513,738.03\n+ 112,000.00 = 9,625,738.03 (matches)\n\nSo, Quick Assets = 9,513,738.03\n\n**Step 2: Identify Current Liabilities**\nTotal Current Liabilities: 628,478.02\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Quick Ratio**\nQuick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities\n= 9,513,738.03 / 628,478.02\n≈ 15.137\n\nHmm, this seems unusually high. Typically, a quick ratio above 1 is considered good, indicating the company can cover its short-term liabilities with its quick assets. A ratio of 15 suggests an extremely high liquidity position, which might be unusual but possible if the company has just received a large cash infusion or has very low current liabilities.\n\nLet me double-check if all components are correctly included in quick assets. Some might argue that \"Interest Receivable\" is not as liquid as accounts receivable, but it's still a receivable that's expected to be collected in the short term. \n\nAlternatively, if we exclude Interest Receivable:\nQuick Assets = Cash + Bank + Accounts Receivable\n= 3,057,369.78 + 4,292,000.00 + 2,149,792.45\n= 9,499,162.23\nQuick Ratio = 9,499,162.23 / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.114\n\nStill very high. Maybe the company is holding too much cash or has very low liabilities. \n\nGiven that the example provided had a quick ratio of 1.54, and our calculation is much higher, perhaps the definition differs. Maybe \"Bank Deposits\" are not considered as quick assets if they're not readily accessible. But typically, bank deposits are considered cash equivalents unless specified otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Accounts Receivable\" are considered quick assets in this context. Let's try that:\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Accounts Receivable\n= 3,057,369.78 + 2,149,792.45\n= 5,207,162.23\nQuick Ratio = 5,207,162.23 / 628,478.02 ≈ 8.285\n\nStill high. Maybe only Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, and Accounts Receivable, excluding Interest Receivable:\n= 3,057,369.78 + 4,292,000.00 + 2,149,792.45 = 9,499,162.23\nRatio = 9,499,162.23 / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.11\n\nGiven that the example included Cash, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, and Accounts Receivable in quick assets, I think we should do the same here, leading to ~15.14.\n\nPerhaps the company indeed has a very high quick ratio due to large cash holdings and low liabilities.\n\n#### Net Profit Margin\n\nThis is straightforward.\n\nNet Profit = 905,750.76\nTotal Revenue = 2,869,560.42\n\nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100%\n= (905,750.76 / 2,869,560.42) * 100%\n≈ 31.56%\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating:\n\n- Quick Ratio: ~15.14 (from 9,513,738.03 / 628,478.02)\n- Net Profit Margin: ~31.56%\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, their quick ratio was calculated by summing Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, and Accounts Receivable, then dividing by Current Liabilities. Following the same method here gives us ~15.14.\n\nSimilarly, their net profit margin was negative because net profit was negative, but here it's positive, giving ~31.56%.\n\nBut let's see if there's any misinterpretation. Maybe \"Bank Deposits\" are not included in quick assets. If we exclude bank deposits:\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 3,057,369.78 + 14,575.80 + 2,149,792.45\n= 5,221,738.03\nQuick Ratio = 5,221,738.03 / 628,478.02 ≈ 8.31\n\nStill high. Maybe only Cash on Hand and Accounts Receivable:\n\n= 3,057,369.78 + 2,149,792.45 = 5,207,162.23\nRatio = 5,207,162.23 / 628,478.02 ≈ 8.29\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and following the example's approach (including bank deposits), I'll stick with ~15.14.\n\nBut perhaps the most conservative approach is to exclude interest receivable and bank deposits, considering only cash and accounts receivable:\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Accounts Receivable\n= 3,057,369.78 + 2,149,792.45\n= 5,207,162.23\nQuick Ratio = 5,207,162.23 / 628,478.02 ≈ 8.29\n\nGiven that the example included bank deposits and interest receivable, and to be consistent, I'll include them, leading to ~15.14.\n\nHowever, looking at the example's calculation:\n\nTheir quick assets were:\nCash on Hand: 270,005.90\nBank Deposits: 164,645.57\nInterest Receivable: 2,672.87\nAccounts Receivable: 2,429,482.13\nTotal: 2,866,806.47\nCurrent Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\nQuick Ratio: 2,866,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54 (matches given solution)\n\nSo, following the same method here:\n\nQuick Assets:\nCash on Hand: 3,057,369.78\nBank Deposits: 4,292,000.00\nInterest Receivable: 14,575.80\nAccounts Receivable: 2,149,792.45\nTotal: 3,057,369.78 + 4,292,000.00 = 7,349,369.78\n+ 14,575.80 = 7,363,945.58\n+ 2,149,792.45 = 9,513,738.03\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 628,478.02\n\nQuick Ratio = 9,513,738.03 / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.14\n\nThis seems correct based on the method used in the example.\n\nFor Net Profit Margin:\n\nNet Profit: 905,750.76\nTotal Revenue: 2,869,560.42\nNet Profit Margin = (905,750.76 / 2,869,560.42) * 100 ≈ 31.56%\n\nBut the example had:\n\nNet Profit: -1,645,141.43\nTotal Revenue: 5,431,018.59\nNet Profit Margin = (-1,645,141.43 / 5,431,018.59) * 100 ≈ -30.29% (matches given solution)\n\nSo, our calculation seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '15.14', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.56%'} }\n```",
