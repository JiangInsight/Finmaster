                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the four requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities here):** 628,478.02\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 13,905,750.76\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{628,478.02}{13,905,750.76} \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\frac{628,478.02}{13,905,750.76} \\approx 0.0452 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.05\n\nBut looking at the example, it seems they might have used more decimal places or considered other liabilities if any. Here, it's just current liabilities, so it's quite low.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** 905,750.76\n- **Total Revenue:** 2,869,560.42\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{905,750.76}{2,869,560.42} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\frac{905,750.76}{2,869,560.42} \\approx 0.3156 \\]\n\\[ 0.3156 \\times 100 \\approx 31.56\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Definition:** This ratio indicates how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nSince we have beginning and ending total assets, we'll calculate average total assets as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Total Assets} + \\text{Ending Total Assets}}{2} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Beginning Total Assets (Initial_amount for Total Assets):** 13,000,000.00\n- **Ending Total Assets (End_amount for Total Assets):** 14,534,228.78\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{13,000,000.00 + 14,534,228.78}{2} = \\frac{27,534,228.78}{2} = 13,767,114.39 \\]\n\nNow, calculate ROA:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\left( \\frac{905,750.76}{13,767,114.39} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\frac{905,750.76}{13,767,114.39} \\approx 0.0658 \\]\n\\[ 0.0658 \\times 100 \\approx 6.58\\% \\]\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company collects revenue from its credit sales. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since we don't have separate data for cash and credit sales), we'll use Total Revenue for Net Credit Sales.\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Accounts Receivable} + \\text{Ending Accounts Receivable}}{2} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Beginning Accounts Receivable (Initial_amount for Accounts Receivable):** 0.00\n- **Ending Accounts Receivable (End_amount for Accounts Receivable):** 2,149,792.45\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{0.00 + 2,149,792.45}{2} = \\frac{2,149,792.45}{2} = 1,074,896.225 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{2,869,560.42}{1,074,896.225} \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2,869,560.42}{1,074,896.225} \\approx 2.669 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 2.67\n\nHowever, looking at the example, they might have annualized the revenue or used a different period. But since the dates are from 2023-12-31 to 2024-02-05 (about 1 month and 5 days), it's a short period. Maybe the revenue is for that period, and the turnover is as is.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.56%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '6.58%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.67'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n- **Debt to Equity Ratio:** 628,478.02 / 13,905,750.76 ≈ 0.045 → 0.05 (rounded)\n- **Net Profit Margin:** (905,750.76 / 2,869,560.42) * 100 ≈ 31.56%\n- **ROA:** (905,750.76 / 13,767,114.39) * 100 ≈ 6.58%\n- **Accounts Receivable Turnover:** 2,869,560.42 / 1,074,896.225 ≈ 2.67\n\nAll calculations seem correct based on the provided data.",
