                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Asset Ratio\nFirst, what is the Debt to Asset Ratio? From what I understand, it's a financial metric that shows the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nBut sometimes, \"Total Debt\" can be interpreted as \"Total Liabilities.\" Looking at the balance sheet provided, we have \"Total Current Liabilities\" and no long-term liabilities listed. So, in this case, the total debt would be the total current liabilities since there are no other liabilities mentioned.\n\n### Identifying the Relevant Numbers\nFrom the balance sheet at the end date (2024-02-05):\n\n1. **Total Current Liabilities**: 628,478.02\n   - This is the sum of:\n     - Accounts Payable: 485,000.00\n     - Taxes Payable: 143,478.02\n\n2. **Total Assets**: 14,534,228.78\n   - This is given directly as \"Total Assets.\"\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{628,478.02}{14,534,228.78} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{628,478.02}{14,534,228.78} \\approx 0.0432 \\]\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 0.0432. \n\n### Formatting the Answer\nThe example provided had the ratio rounded to two decimal places, so let's do the same:\n\n\\[ 0.0432 \\approx 0.04 \\]\n\nBut looking at the example, it seems they might have used more precise rounding or calculation. Let me check the calculation again to ensure accuracy.\n\nRecalculating:\n\n\\[ 628,478.02 / 14,534,228.78 \\approx 0.04324 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.04\n\nBut in the example, they had '0.14', which was likely from dividing total current liabilities by total assets (1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.14). \n\nSo, similarly here, it's:\n\n628,478.02 / 14,534,228.78 ≈ 0.04324\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.04\n\nBut perhaps they expect more precision. Let's try four decimal places: 0.0432\n\nBut the example had two decimal places, so maybe 0.04 is fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they consider all liabilities, but here only current liabilities are present. \n\nGiven that, and no other liabilities, the ratio is 0.0432, which we can present as '0.04' or '0.043'. \n\nLooking at the example, they used two decimal places, so I'll go with two.\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04'} }\n```\n\nBut let me cross-validate:\n\nIn the example:\nTotal Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\nTotal Assets: 13,216,409.49\nRatio: 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.1409 → '0.14'\n\nSimilarly here:\nTotal Current Liabilities: 628,478.02\nTotal Assets: 14,534,228.78\nRatio: 628,478.02 / 14,534,228.78 ≈ 0.04324 → '0.04'\n\nYes, seems correct.\n\n### Verifying if There's More Debt\nIs there any other debt not listed under current liabilities? Looking at the balance sheet:\n\n- Accounts Payable: current\n- Taxes Payable: current\n- No long-term liabilities listed\n- Paid-in Capital and Retained Earnings are equity, not debt\n\nSo, total debt is indeed just total current liabilities.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.04 when rounded to two decimal places.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04'} }\n```",
