                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Equity Ratio, the Net Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the financial leverage of a company by comparing its total liabilities to its shareholders' equity.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 628,478.02\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so **Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 628,478.02**\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 13,905,750.76\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{628,478.02}{13,905,750.76} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ \\frac{628,478.02}{13,905,750.76} \\approx 0.0452 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[ \\approx 0.05 \\]\n\nBut looking at the example, it seems they might have used more decimal places or different rounding. Let me check the numbers again to ensure accuracy.\n\nWait, is Total Liabilities just the current liabilities? The balance sheet shows \"Total Current Liabilities\" as 628,478.02, and there's no mention of long-term liabilities, so it seems correct.\n\nSo, 628,478.02 / 13,905,750.76 â‰ˆ 0.0452, which is approximately 0.05 when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nBut the example had a ratio of 0.16, which seems higher. Maybe I missed something. Let me see if there are other liabilities.\n\nLooking back at the balance sheet, under liabilities, only \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\" are listed under current liabilities, summing to 628,478.02. No other liabilities are mentioned, so it seems correct.\n\nPerhaps the example had more liabilities not shown here. For this problem, it seems the ratio is approximately 0.05.\n\nBut to match the format, let's keep it to two decimal places: '0.05'.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net profit is generated as a percentage of revenue.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** 905,750.76\n- **Total Revenue:** 2,869,560.42\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{905,750.76}{2,869,560.42} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide:\n\\[ \\frac{905,750.76}{2,869,560.42} \\approx 0.3156 \\]\n\nThen multiply by 100:\n\\[ 0.3156 \\times 100 \\approx 31.56\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is approximately 31.56%.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -650,630.22\n- From the balance sheet:\n  - **Total Current Liabilities:** 628,478.02\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-650,630.22}{628,478.02} \\]\n\nDivide:\n\\[ \\frac{-650,630.22}{628,478.02} \\approx -1.035 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[ \\approx -1.04 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.56%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.04'}}\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the Debt to Equity Ratio was calculated as Total Current Liabilities divided by Total Owner's Equity, which seems correct based on the given data. Maybe the example had more liabilities not shown. In our case, it's indeed 0.05.\n\nSimilarly, the Net Profit Margin is positive here (31.56%), unlike the example which was negative.\n\nThe operating cash flow to current liabilities is negative here (-1.04), indicating that operating cash flow is not sufficient to cover current liabilities, similar to the example but with a different magnitude.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.56%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.04'}}\n```",
