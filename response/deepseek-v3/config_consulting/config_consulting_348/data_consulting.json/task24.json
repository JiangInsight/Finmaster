                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate two ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Asset Ratio and the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities listed) = 628,478.02\n- Total Assets = 14,534,228.78\n\nWait a minute, in the balance sheet, under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" it's listed as 628,478.02. There's no mention of long-term liabilities, so we'll assume that total liabilities are just the current liabilities here.\n\nBut looking back at the example provided, the \"Total Current Liabilities\" was used for the debt in the Debt to Asset Ratio. So, we'll do the same here.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{628,478.02}{14,534,228.78} \\]\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{628,478.02}{14,534,228.78} \\approx 0.0432 \\]\n\nSo, approximately 0.043 or 4.32%. But the example had it as a decimal between 0 and 1, so we'll keep it as 0.043.\n\nBut looking at the example solution, it was presented as '0.14', which seems to be rounded to two decimal places. Maybe they rounded differently. Let's see:\n\n628,478.02 / 14,534,228.78 ≈ 0.0432\n\nMaybe I'm missing something. Are there other liabilities? The balance sheet shows only \"Total Current Liabilities\" and no other liabilities, so total liabilities should be 628,478.02.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" is considered, but that's equal to Total Assets, so that can't be.\n\nI think it's correct as 0.043, but the example had a similar small number presented as '0.14', which seems higher. Maybe they included something else in liabilities. \n\nWait, in the example, total current liabilities were 1,861,550.92, and total assets were 13,216,409.49, so:\n\n1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.1409, which rounds to '0.14'.\n\nSo in our case, it's 628,478.02 / 14,534,228.78 ≈ 0.043.\n\nMaybe the example had more liabilities. \n\nGiven that, I think our calculation is correct at approximately 0.043.\n\nBut to match the format, maybe we round to two decimal places: '0.04'.\n\nBut the example had '0.14', which is two decimal places. So '0.04' seems appropriate here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an error in identifying total liabilities. The balance sheet shows:\n\n- Accounts Payable: 485,000.00\n- Taxes Payable: 143,478.02\n- Total Current Liabilities: 628,478.02\n\nNo other liabilities are listed, so total liabilities should be 628,478.02.\n\nThus, Debt to Asset Ratio = 628,478.02 / 14,534,228.78 ≈ 0.043 → '0.04'\n\nBut the example had '0.14', which is higher, maybe because their liabilities were higher relative to assets. \n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with '0.04'.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the operating cash flow to the net income, indicating how well net income is being converted into cash. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -650,630.22\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = 905,750.76\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-650,630.22}{905,750.76} \\approx -0.718 \\]\n\nThis is a negative ratio, which suggests that the operating cash flow is negative while net income is positive, which is unusual but possible (maybe due to significant non-cash expenses or changes in working capital).\n\nIn the example provided, the ratio was '4.41', which was positive. Here, it's negative, which might indicate a problem or just a different scenario.\n\nBut let's check the numbers:\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities is indeed -650,630.22, and Net Income is 905,750.76.\n\nSo the ratio is -0.718, which we can present as '-0.72' rounded to two decimal places.\n\nBut the example had a positive ratio, so this seems correct based on the given data.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.72'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure no mistakes.\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n   - Total Liabilities: 628,478.02 (only current liabilities listed)\n   - Total Assets: 14,534,228.78\n   - Ratio: 628,478.02 / 14,534,228.78 ≈ 0.043 → '0.04'\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:**\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -650,630.22\n   - Net Income: 905,750.76\n   - Ratio: -650,630.22 / 905,750.76 ≈ -0.718 → '-0.72'\n\nEverything checks out based on the provided data. The negative operating cash flow to net income ratio might indicate that even though the company is reporting a net profit, its operations are consuming cash, possibly due to increases in accounts receivable or inventory that aren't yet converted to cash.\n\nThus, the final answer is correct.",
