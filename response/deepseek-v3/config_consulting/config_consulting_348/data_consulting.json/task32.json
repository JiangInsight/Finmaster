                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested metrics based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nFree Cash Flow is typically calculated as:\n**FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures**\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -650,630.22\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (Capital Expenditures) = 0.00\n\nSo,\nFCF = -650,630.22 - 0 = -650,630.22\n\nBut looking at the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents, it's also -650,630.22, which matches our calculation.\n\n### 2. Return on Assets (ROA)\nROA measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit. It's calculated as:\n**ROA = Net Profit / Average Total Assets**\n\nFirst, we need Average Total Assets:\nInitial Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\nEnding Total Assets = 14,534,228.78\nAverage Total Assets = (13,000,000 + 14,534,228.78) / 2 = 13,767,114.39\n\nNet Profit = 905,750.76\n\nROA = 905,750.76 / 13,767,114.39 ≈ 0.0658 or 6.58%\n\n### 3. Return on Equity (ROE)\nROE measures profitability relative to shareholders' equity. It's calculated as:\n**ROE = Net Profit / Average Shareholders' Equity**\n\nAverage Shareholders' Equity:\nInitial Equity = 13,000,000.00\nEnding Equity = 13,905,750.76\nAverage Equity = (13,000,000 + 13,905,750.76) / 2 = 13,452,875.38\n\nNet Profit = 905,750.76\n\nROE = 905,750.76 / 13,452,875.38 ≈ 0.0673 or 6.73%\n\n### 4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operations to the net income. It's calculated as:\n**Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Income**\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -650,630.22\nNet Income = 905,750.76\n\nRatio = -650,630.22 / 905,750.76 ≈ -0.718\n\nThis negative ratio suggests that the company's operating cash flow is negative despite having positive net income, which might indicate issues like high receivables or inventory increases.\n\n### 5. Net Profit Margin\nThis shows how much of each dollar of revenue is profit. It's calculated as:\n**Net Profit Margin = Net Profit / Total Revenue**\n\nNet Profit = 905,750.76\nTotal Revenue = 2,869,560.42\n\nNet Profit Margin = 905,750.76 / 2,869,560.42 ≈ 0.3156 or 31.56%\n\n### 6. Gross Profit Margin\nThis shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold. It's calculated as:\n**Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Total Revenue**\n\nGross Profit = 1,620,560.42\nTotal Revenue = 2,869,560.42\n\nGross Profit Margin = 1,620,560.42 / 2,869,560.42 ≈ 0.5647 or 56.47%\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-650630.22', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '6.58%', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '6.73%', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.72', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.56%', 'Gross Profit Margin': '56.47%'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me quickly verify the calculations to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. FCF: -650,630.22 (matches net increase in cash)\n2. ROA: 905,750.76 / 13,767,114.39 ≈ 6.58% ✔\n3. ROE: 905,750.76 / 13,452,875.38 ≈ 6.73% ✔\n4. OCF to Net Income: -650,630.22 / 905,750.76 ≈ -0.72 ✔\n5. Net Profit Margin: 905,750.76 / 2,869,560.42 ≈ 31.56% ✔\n6. Gross Profit Margin: 1,620,560.42 / 2,869,560.42 ≈ 56.47% ✔\n\nEverything checks out!",
