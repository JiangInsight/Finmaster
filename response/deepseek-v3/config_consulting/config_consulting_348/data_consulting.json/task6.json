                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Net Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Net Profit Margin\nFirst, I need to recall what the Net Profit Margin is. From what I remember, the Net Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows what percentage of a company's revenue is actual profit after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted. \n\nThe formula for Net Profit Margin is:\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nThis will give us a percentage that represents how much of each dollar earned by the company is profit.\n\n### Identifying the Given Values\nLooking at the provided income statement:\n\n- **Total Revenue**: 2,869,560.42\n- **Net Profit**: 905,750.76\n\nThese are the two main numbers I need for the calculation.\n\n### Calculating the Net Profit Margin\nNow, let's plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{905,750.76}{2,869,560.42} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide Net Profit by Total Revenue:\n\n\\[ \\frac{905,750.76}{2,869,560.42} \\approx 0.3156 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.3156 \\times 100 \\approx 31.56\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nLet me double-check the division to ensure accuracy:\n\n\\[ 2,869,560.42 \\times 0.3156 \\approx 905,750.76 \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ 2,869,560 \\times 0.3156 \\approx 2,869,560 \\times \\frac{3156}{10000} \\]\n\\[ \\approx 2,869,560 \\times 0.3156 \\]\n\\[ \\approx 2,869,560 \\times 0.3 = 860,868 \\]\n\\[ 2,869,560 \\times 0.0156 \\approx 44,765 \\]\n\\[ 860,868 + 44,765 \\approx 905,633 \\]\n\nHmm, this is close to 905,750.76, but not exact. Maybe the exact division is better:\n\n\\[ 905,750.76 / 2,869,560.42 \\approx 0.3156 \\]\n\nYes, seems correct. The slight difference might be due to rounding during multiplication.\n\n### Final Answer\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is approximately 31.56%.\n\n### Formatting the Answer\nThe solution should be presented in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '31.56%'} }\n```\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter carefully performing the calculations and verifying them, the Net Profit Margin for the given income statement is **31.56%**.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '31.56%'} }\n```",
