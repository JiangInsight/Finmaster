                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the required ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 9,625,738.03\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 628,478.02\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 9,625,738.03 / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.32\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n**Formula:** (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 1,620,560.42\n- Total Revenue = 2,869,560.42\n\nCalculation:\nGross Profit Margin = (1,620,560.42 / 2,869,560.42) * 100 ≈ 56.47%\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 628,478.02 (seems to be the only liabilities)\n- Total Assets = 14,534,228.78\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 628,478.02 / 14,534,228.78 ≈ 0.043 or 4.3%\n\nWait, is Total Current Liabilities the only liabilities here? Looking at the balance sheet, it seems so. There's no long-term debt mentioned. So, total liabilities = 628,478.02.\n\n### 4. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:** (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 905,750.76\n- Total Revenue = 2,869,560.42\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (905,750.76 / 2,869,560.42) * 100 ≈ 31.56%\n\n### 5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand (End_amount) = 3,057,369.78\n- Bank Deposits (End_amount) = 4,292,000.00\n- Total Current Liabilities = 628,478.02\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits = 3,057,369.78 + 4,292,000.00 = 7,349,369.78\n\nCalculation:\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = 7,349,369.78 / 628,478.02 ≈ 11.69\n\n### 6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n**Formula:** Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -650,630.22\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -0.00\n\nCalculation:\nFCF = -650,630.22 + (-0.00) = -650,630.22\n\nAlternatively, sometimes FCF is considered as the net increase in cash and equivalents, which is -650,630.22 (from \"Net Increase\" in cash flow statement). Both methods give the same value here.\n\n### 7. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:** (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 905,750.76\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets (End_amount) = 14,534,228.78\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (905,750.76 / 14,534,228.78) * 100 ≈ 6.23%\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '15.32', 'Gross Profit Margin': '56.47%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '4.30%', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.56%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '11.69', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-650630.22', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '6.23%'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me quickly check if all calculations make sense:\n- Current Ratio is high, indicating strong liquidity.\n- Gross Profit Margin is over 50%, which is quite healthy.\n- Debt to Asset is very low, meaning almost no debt.\n- Net Profit Margin is also high, indicating good profitability.\n- Cash to Current Debt is very high, meaning ample cash to cover short-term debts.\n- FCF is negative, but that's from the cash flow statement directly.\n- ROA is positive, showing assets are generating profit.\n\nEverything seems consistent with the data provided.",
