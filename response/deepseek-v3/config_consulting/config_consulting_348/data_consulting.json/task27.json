                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. We have three financial statements: the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement. We need to calculate three ratios:\n\n1. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio**\n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio**\n3. **Quick Ratio**\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how much cash flow is generated from operating activities relative to the net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -650,630.22\n- Net Profit = 905,750.76\n\nWait a minute, the net cash flow from operating activities is negative, and net profit is positive. That seems unusual because typically, if a company is profitable, you'd expect positive cash flow from operations. Maybe there's a timing difference in receivables and payables.\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-650,630.22}{905,750.76} \\approx -0.718 \\]\n\nBut in the example provided, the ratio was positive even when both numbers were negative. Maybe we take absolute values or there's a different interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is supposed to be positive, indicating how many times the net income is covered by operating cash flow, but here it's negative, which might not make sense. Maybe it's better to present it as is, acknowledging that operating cash flow is negative while net income is positive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit} + \\text{Non-cash expenses} - \\text{Changes in working capital}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\nBut looking at the cash flow statement, the net cash flow from operating activities is already calculated by adjusting net profit for these items. So the direct ratio is net cash flow from operations divided by net profit.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed with:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{-650,630.22}{905,750.76} \\approx -0.72 \\]\n\nBut the example had a positive ratio even with negative numbers, so maybe it's the absolute value or the inverse. Maybe it's:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}} \\]\n\nBut that would be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{905,750.76}{-650,630.22} \\approx -1.39 \\]\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the correct interpretation is the absolute value of the ratio of operating cash flow to net income, indicating how much cash flow is generated per unit of net income, regardless of sign.\n\nGiven the example had:\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -7,259,994.10\nNet Profit = -1,645,141.43\nRatio = 4.41\n\nWhich is -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41\n\nSo the correct formula is indeed operating cash flow divided by net income, keeping the signs.\n\nSo for our case:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-650,630.22}{905,750.76} \\approx -0.72 \\]\n\nBut presenting a negative ratio might not be standard. Maybe it's acceptable to say that for every dollar of net income, there's a negative $0.72 in operating cash flow, indicating that despite the profit, cash is being used in operations, possibly due to increases in working capital.\n\nSo we'll keep it as -0.72.\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need average current assets. Since we have beginning and ending balances:\n\nBeginning Current Assets = 8,000,000.00 (from initial_amount in balance sheet)\nEnding Current Assets = 9,625,738.03\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{8,000,000.00 + 9,625,738.03}{2} = \\frac{17,625,738.03}{2} = 8,812,869.015 \\]\n\nTotal Revenue from income statement = 2,869,560.42\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{2,869,560.42}{8,812,869.015} \\approx 0.3256 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.33\n\n### 3. Quick Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to meet short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nQuick Assets typically include Cash, Marketable Securities, and Accounts Receivable (excluding Inventory and other less liquid current assets).\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Cash on Hand = 3,057,369.78\n- Bank Deposits = 4,292,000.00\n- Interest Receivable = 14,575.80\n- Accounts Receivable = 2,149,792.45\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = \\text{Cash on Hand} + \\text{Bank Deposits} + \\text{Accounts Receivable} + \\text{Interest Receivable} \\]\n\\[ = 3,057,369.78 + 4,292,000.00 + 2,149,792.45 + 14,575.80 \\]\n\\[ = 3,057,369.78 + 4,292,000.00 = 7,349,369.78 \\]\n\\[ + 2,149,792.45 = 9,499,162.23 \\]\n\\[ + 14,575.80 = 9,513,738.03 \\]\n\nCurrent Liabilities (end amount) = 628,478.02\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{9,513,738.03}{628,478.02} \\approx 15.14 \\]\n\nThis seems very high, which might indicate that the company has a lot of liquid assets relative to its current liabilities. Maybe I included too much in quick assets. Typically, quick assets are cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Interest receivable might be excluded if it's not readily convertible to cash.\n\nLet's exclude interest receivable:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = 3,057,369.78 + 4,292,000.00 + 2,149,792.45 = 9,499,162.23 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{9,499,162.23}{628,478.02} \\approx 15.11 \\]\n\nStill very high. Maybe bank deposits are not considered as liquid? But usually, they are. Alternatively, maybe the current liabilities are understated or the company is very liquid.\n\nGiven the data, this seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.72', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.33', 'Quick Ratio': '15.11'}}\n```\n\nHowever, the quick ratio seems unusually high. Let me double-check the components:\n\nFrom the balance sheet, current liabilities are:\n- Accounts Payable = 485,000.00\n- Taxes Payable = 143,478.02\nTotal = 628,478.02\n\nQuick assets:\n- Cash on Hand = 3,057,369.78\n- Bank Deposits = 4,292,000.00\n- Accounts Receivable = 2,149,792.45\nTotal = 9,499,162.23\n\nQuick Ratio = 9,499,162.23 / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.11\n\nThis seems correct based on the data provided. Maybe the company has just raised a lot of cash or has very low current liabilities compared to its liquid assets.\n\nSimilarly, the operating cash flow to net income ratio is negative, which is unusual but possible if the company has significant increases in working capital despite being profitable.\n\nThe current assets turnover ratio of 0.33 means that for every dollar of current assets, the company generates $0.33 in revenue, which might be low, indicating less efficient use of current assets.\n\nGiven that, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.72', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.33', 'Quick Ratio': '15.11'}}\n```",
