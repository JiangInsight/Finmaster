                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 9,625,738.03\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 628,478.02\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 9,625,738.03 / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.32\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Definition:** (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Inventory = 112,000.00\n- So, Quick Assets = 9,625,738.03 - 112,000.00 = 9,513,738.03\n- Current Liabilities = 628,478.02\n\nCalculation:\nQuick Ratio = 9,513,738.03 / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.14\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Definition:** Total Debt / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 628,478.02\n- Total Assets = 14,534,228.78\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 628,478.02 / 14,534,228.78 ≈ 0.043 or 4.3%\n\nWait a minute, in the example provided, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated using Total Current Liabilities as the debt, but typically, \"Total Debt\" includes both current and long-term liabilities. Here, since only current liabilities are present, it's just that. \n\nBut looking back at the example, they might have considered only current liabilities as total debt since no long-term liabilities were present. So, following that approach:\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 628,478.02 / 14,534,228.78 ≈ 0.043\n\nBut the example had a higher ratio, maybe they included something else. Wait, in the example, the total liabilities were equal to current liabilities since no other liabilities were listed. Similarly here.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other debt. The balance sheet shows only Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable under current liabilities, summing to Total Current Liabilities. So, total debt is 628,478.02.\n\nSo, Debt to Asset Ratio = 628,478.02 / 14,534,228.78 ≈ 0.043\n\nBut the example had 0.14, which was Total Current Liabilities / Total Assets. Maybe the term \"Debt\" here is being used synonymously with \"Total Liabilities,\" which in this case is just current liabilities.\n\nSo, sticking with that:\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 628,478.02 / 14,534,228.78 ≈ 0.043\n\nBut to match the format, let's express it as '0.04'.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** Total Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Debt (Total Liabilities) = 628,478.02\n- Total Owner's Equity = 13,905,750.76\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 628,478.02 / 13,905,750.76 ≈ 0.045 or '0.05' when rounded.\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -650,630.22\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 628,478.02\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -650,630.22 / 628,478.02 ≈ -1.04\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '15.32', 'Quick Ratio': '15.14', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.04'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check the calculations quickly:\n\n1. Current Ratio: 9,625,738.03 / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.32 ✔\n2. Quick Ratio: (9,625,738.03 - 112,000) / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.14 ✔\n3. Debt to Asset: 628,478.02 / 14,534,228.78 ≈ 0.043 → '0.04' ✔\n4. Debt to Equity: 628,478.02 / 13,905,750.76 ≈ 0.045 → '0.05' ✔\n5. Cash Flow to Debt: -650,630.22 / 628,478.02 ≈ -1.04 ✔\n\nEverything checks out!",
