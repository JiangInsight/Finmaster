                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through each calculation step by step to ensure I understand how to derive them from the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures how efficiently a company collects receivables from its customers. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\nFrom the data:\n- **Net Credit Sales**: Assuming all sales are credit sales, we can use \"Main Business Revenue\" from the income statement, which is \\$2,869,560.42.\n- **Average Accounts Receivable**: \n  - Beginning Accounts Receivable (Initial_amount): \\$0.00\n  - Ending Accounts Receivable (End_amount): \\$2,149,792.45\n  - Average = (Beginning + Ending) / 2 = (0 + 2,149,792.45) / 2 = \\$1,074,896.225\n\nBut wait, if beginning is \\$0 and ending is \\$2,149,792.45, the average is \\$1,074,896.225. However, if the company started with \\$0 in receivables and ended with \\$2,149,792.45, it might imply all sales were on credit and none were collected, which seems unrealistic. Maybe the initial amount is missing or zero at the start of the period.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the initial amount is zero, and all receivables are from the current period, then perhaps the average is closer to the ending amount, but standard practice is to average beginning and ending.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed with the average:\n\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{2,869,560.42}{1,074,896.225} \\approx 2.67 \\]\n\nBut looking back at the example provided, they might have used only ending receivables if beginning is zero. Let me check:\n\nIn the example:\n- Net Credit Sales: 5,431,018.59\n- Average AR: (0 + 2,429,482.13) / 2 = 1,214,741.065\n- Ratio: 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 ≈ 4.47 (matches given solution)\n\nSo, same method here:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2,869,560.42}{1,074,896.225} \\approx 2.67 \\]\n\nBut let's compute it precisely:\n\n2,869,560.42 / 1,074,896.225 ≈ 2.6696 ≈ 2.67\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the data:\n- **Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -\\$650,630.22 (negative)\n- **Current Liabilities**: \\$628,478.02\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-650,630.22}{628,478.02} \\approx -1.035 \\]\n\nBut in the example, they had:\n- Operating Cash Flow: -7,259,994.10\n- Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\n- Ratio: -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.90 (matches)\n\nSo, similarly here:\n\n-650,630.22 / 628,478.02 ≈ -1.035\n\nBut the example seems to round to two decimal places, so -1.04.\n\nWait, the example has the same value for 'operating cash flow ratio' and 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio', which suggests they might be the same ratio referred to differently. \n\nLooking up, 'operating cash flow ratio' is indeed cash flow from operations divided by current liabilities. So both names refer to the same ratio.\n\nThus, both are -1.04.\n\nBut in the example, both were -3.90, same value. So here both would be -1.04.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nAs above, same as Operating Cash Flow Ratio, so -1.04.\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Sales}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the data:\n- **Net Sales**: \\$2,869,560.42 (Main Business Revenue)\n- **Average Total Assets**:\n  - Beginning Total Assets: \\$13,000,000.00\n  - Ending Total Assets: \\$14,534,228.78\n  - Average = (13,000,000 + 14,534,228.78) / 2 = \\$13,767,114.39\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{2,869,560.42}{13,767,114.39} \\approx 0.208 \\]\n\nBut in the example:\n- Net Sales: 5,431,018.59\n- Average Total Assets: (13,000,000 + 13,216,409.49) / 2 = 13,108,204.745\n- Ratio: 5,431,018.59 / 13,108,204.745 ≈ 0.414 ≈ 0.41 (matches given solution)\n\nSo similarly here:\n\n2,869,560.42 / 13,767,114.39 ≈ 0.208\n\nBut the example was 0.41, so this seems correct method.\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures the financial leverage of a company by comparing its total liabilities to shareholders' equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the data:\n- **Total Liabilities**: \n  - From the balance sheet, \"Total Current Liabilities\" is \\$628,478.02. There are no non-current liabilities listed, so total liabilities = \\$628,478.02.\n- **Total Shareholders' Equity**: \\$13,905,750.76\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{628,478.02}{13,905,750.76} \\approx 0.045 \\]\n\nBut in the example:\n- Total Liabilities: 1,861,550.92 (only current liabilities)\n- Total Equity: 11,354,858.57\n- Ratio: 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.1639 ≈ 0.16 (matches given solution)\n\nSo similarly here:\n\n628,478.02 / 13,905,750.76 ≈ 0.045\n\nBut the example had 0.16, so this seems correct method.\n\nHowever, looking back at the balance sheet, is there any other liability? It seems only current liabilities are present, no long-term debt. So total liabilities are just current liabilities.\n\nThus, ratio is 0.045, or 0.05 when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nBut the example was 0.16, so perhaps they included something else, but here it's straightforward.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter calculating all the ratios:\n\n1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: 2.67\n2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -1.04\n3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: -1.04\n4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio: 0.21\n5. Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.05\n\nRounding to two decimal places as in the example:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.67', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-1.04', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.04', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.21', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05'}}\n```\n\nHowever, let me double-check the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio calculation because the example had a higher ratio with similar data.\n\nWait, in the example:\n- Sales: 5,431,018.59\n- Avg AR: (0 + 2,429,482.13)/2 = 1,214,741.065\n- Ratio: 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 ≈ 4.47\n\nHere:\n- Sales: 2,869,560.42\n- Avg AR: (0 + 2,149,792.45)/2 = 1,074,896.225\n- Ratio: 2,869,560.42 / 1,074,896.225 ≈ 2.669 ≈ 2.67\n\nSo calculation seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, other ratios seem correctly calculated based on the given data.\n\nThus, final answer is as above.\n\nBut the Total Asset Turnover Ratio was 0.208, so rounding to two decimal places is 0.21, not 0.20.\n\nSimilarly, Debt to Equity is 0.045, so 0.05.\n\nOperating cash flow ratios are -1.035, so -1.04.\n\nAccounts Receivable is 2.669, so 2.67.\n\nSo final:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.67', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-1.04', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.04', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.21', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05'}}\n```",
