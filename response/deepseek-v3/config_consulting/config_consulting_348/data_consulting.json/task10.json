In this case, it is -650,630.22.\n\n2. **Identify the Total Current Liabilities**: This is found in the balance sheet under \"Total Current Liabilities\". In this case, it is 628,478.02.\n\n3. **Calculate the Ratio**: The formula for the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the numbers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{-650,630.22}{628,478.02} \\approx -1.035\n   \\]\n\n4. **Round the Result**: Rounding to two decimal places, the ratio is -1.04.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.04'} }\n```",
