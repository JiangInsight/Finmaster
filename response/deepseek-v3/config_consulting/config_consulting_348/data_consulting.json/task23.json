                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate two key ratios: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio. \n\n### 1. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:**  \nGross Profit Margin is a measure of a company's profitability and is calculated by dividing gross profit by total revenue. It shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS).\n\n**Formula:**  \nGross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) × 100\n\n**Given Data from Income Statement:**  \n- Gross Profit = 1,620,560.42  \n- Total Revenue = 2,869,560.42  \n\n**Calculation:**  \nGross Profit Margin = (1,620,560.42 / 2,869,560.42) × 100  \nLet's do the division first:  \n1,620,560.42 ÷ 2,869,560.42 ≈ 0.5647  \nNow multiply by 100 to get the percentage:  \n0.5647 × 100 ≈ 56.47%\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately 56.47%.\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n**Definition:**  \nThis ratio measures a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It indicates how many times the company can pay off its debt with its cash flow from operations.\n\n**Formula:**  \nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt\n\n**Identifying Total Debt:**  \nFrom the balance sheet, total debt isn't directly given, but we can infer it from the liabilities.  \nTotal Current Liabilities = 628,478.02  \nAssuming there are no long-term liabilities (since they're not listed), Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 628,478.02\n\n**Given Data from Cash Flow Statement:**  \nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -650,630.22  \n\n**Calculation:**  \nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -650,630.22 / 628,478.02  \nLet's do the division:  \n-650,630.22 ÷ 628,478.02 ≈ -1.035\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately -1.035.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '56.47%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.035'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin:**  \n   1,620,560.42 / 2,869,560.42 = 0.5647 → 56.47% ✔\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:**  \n   -650,630.22 / 628,478.02 = -1.035 ✔  \n   (Assuming total debt is only current liabilities since no long-term liabilities are provided.)\n\nEverything checks out! \n\n**Note on Cash Flow to Debt Ratio Interpretation:**  \nA negative ratio indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative, meaning it's not generating enough cash from operations to cover its debt, which could be a concern. However, in this case, the debt is relatively small compared to the negative cash flow, leading to a ratio slightly below -1.\n\n**Alternative Consideration for Total Debt:**  \nIf we consider that \"Total Liabilities\" might include more than just current liabilities, but in the given balance sheet, only current liabilities are listed under liabilities (Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable sum up to Total Current Liabilities), and there's no separate line for long-term liabilities, it's reasonable to assume total debt equals total current liabilities here. \n\nIf there were long-term liabilities, they would be added to current liabilities to get total debt. But since they're absent, we proceed with total current liabilities as total debt. \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe calculations are correct based on the provided financial statements. \n\nFinal JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '56.47%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.035'} }\n```",
