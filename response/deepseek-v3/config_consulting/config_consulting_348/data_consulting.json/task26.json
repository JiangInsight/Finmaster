                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: Return on Equity (ROE), Debt to Asset Ratio, and Gross Profit Margin. \n\n### 1. Understanding the Ratios\n\n**a. Return on Equity (ROE):**\nThis measures how effectively a company is using its shareholders' equity to generate profit. The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Shareholders' Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n*Note:* Sometimes, especially for simplicity, we might use the ending shareholders' equity if beginning isn't provided or if changes are minimal. Here, we have both initial and end amounts, so we can calculate average equity.\n\n**b. Debt to Asset Ratio:**\nThis shows the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\nA higher ratio means more debt is used to finance assets.\n\n**c. Gross Profit Margin:**\nThis indicates the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\nIt shows how efficiently a company produces its goods or services.\n\n### 2. Extracting Necessary Data from the Financial Statements\n\nLet's pull out the numbers we need from each statement.\n\n**From the Balance Sheet (as of 2024-02-05):**\n- Total Assets: 14,534,228.78\n- Total Current Liabilities: 628,478.02\n  - (This seems to be the only liability; no non-current liabilities are listed.)\n- Total Owner's Equity:\n  - Initial: 13,000,000.00\n  - End: 13,905,750.76\n\n**From the Income Statement:**\n- Total Revenue: 2,869,560.42\n- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): 1,249,000.00\n- Gross Profit: 1,620,560.42\n- Net Profit: 905,750.76\n\n### 3. Calculating Each Ratio\n\n**a. Return on Equity (ROE):**\nFirst, calculate average shareholders' equity:\n\\[ \\text{Average Equity} = \\frac{\\text{Initial Equity} + \\text{End Equity}}{2} = \\frac{13,000,000 + 13,905,750.76}{2} = \\frac{26,905,750.76}{2} = 13,452,875.38 \\]\n\nNow, ROE:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{905,750.76}{13,452,875.38} \\times 100 \\approx 6.73\\% \\]\n\n**b. Debt to Asset Ratio:**\nTotal Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 628,478.02 (since no other liabilities are listed)\nTotal Assets = 14,534,228.78\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{628,478.02}{14,534,228.78} \\approx 0.043 \\]\n\n*Wait a minute,* in the balance sheet, Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity equals Total Assets, which is correct (628,478.02 + 13,905,750.76 = 14,534,228.78). So, total liabilities are indeed 628,478.02.\n\nBut looking back at the example provided, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated as Total Current Liabilities / Total Assets, even though there might be other liabilities. Here, it seems only current liabilities are present, so the calculation seems correct.\n\nHowever, sometimes \"Debt\" might refer to interest-bearing liabilities, but in absence of that detail, we'll consider all liabilities as debt.\n\nSo, 628,478.02 / 14,534,228.78 ≈ 0.043 or 4.3%. But the example had it as a decimal (0.14), not percentage, so we'll keep it as 0.043.\n\nBut let me double-check if I missed any liabilities. Looking at the balance sheet, under liabilities, only Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable are listed, summing to Total Current Liabilities. No long-term debts or other liabilities are mentioned. So, seems correct.\n\n**c. Gross Profit Margin:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{1,620,560.42}{2,869,560.42} \\times 100 \\approx 56.47\\% \\]\n\n*Calculating:*\n1,620,560.42 / 2,869,560.42 ≈ 0.5647 → 56.47%\n\n### 4. Verifying Calculations\n\nLet me quickly verify each:\n\n- **ROE:**\n  Net Profit: 905,750.76\n  Average Equity: (13,000,000 + 13,905,750.76)/2 = 13,452,875.38\n  905,750.76 / 13,452,875.38 ≈ 0.0673 → 6.73%\n\n- **Debt to Asset:**\n  Total Liabilities: 628,478.02\n  Total Assets: 14,534,228.78\n  628,478.02 / 14,534,228.78 ≈ 0.043\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin:**\n  Gross Profit: 1,620,560.42\n  Revenue: 2,869,560.42\n  1,620,560.42 / 2,869,560.42 ≈ 0.5647 → 56.47%\n\n### 5. Final Answer\n\nAfter calculating:\n\n- ROE: 6.73%\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.043\n- Gross Profit Margin: 56.47%\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated as Total Current Liabilities / Total Assets, which in our case is 628,478.02 / 14,534,228.78 ≈ 0.043. \n\nBut in the example, it was 1861550.92 / 13216409.49 ≈ 0.14, which matches their given solution. So our calculation seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, Gross Profit Margin in example was 1021018.59 / 5431018.59 ≈ 0.188 → 18.8%, which matches their solution. Our calculation is analogous.\n\nROE in example was -1645141.43 / ((13000000 + 11354858.57)/2) ≈ -1645141.43 / 12177429.285 ≈ -0.1351 → -13.51%, which matches. So our method is correct.\n\nTherefore, our final ratios are correct as calculated.\n\n### 6. Formatting the Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '6.73%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04', 'Gross Profit Margin': '56.47%'} }\n```\n\n*Note:* I rounded Debt to Asset Ratio to two decimal places as in the example (0.14), so here 0.043 → 0.04. Alternatively, could keep more precision, but two decimals seem standard.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '6.73%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04', 'Gross Profit Margin': '56.47%'} }\n```",
