                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: Debt to Asset Ratio, Gross Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 628,478.02\n- There's no mention of long-term liabilities, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 628,478.02\n- **Total Assets (End_amount):** 14,534,228.78\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{628,478.02}{14,534,228.78} \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{628,478.02}{14,534,228.78} \\approx 0.0432 \\]\n\nExpressed as a percentage or decimal in the format similar to the example, it's '0.04' (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nWait, the example had it as '0.14', which is two decimal places. So, 0.0432 rounds to 0.04.\n\nBut let's check if there are any other liabilities. Looking at the balance sheet, under liabilities, only \"Total Current Liabilities\" is given as 628,478.02, and no other liabilities are listed. So, total liabilities are indeed 628,478.02.\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 1,620,560.42\n- **Total Revenue:** 2,869,560.42\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,620,560.42}{2,869,560.42} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nLet's calculate:\n\\[ \\frac{1,620,560.42}{2,869,560.42} \\approx 0.5647 \\]\n\\[ 0.5647 \\times 100\\% \\approx 56.47\\% \\]\n\nRounded to two decimal places as in the example ('18.80%'), it's '56.47%'.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -650,630.22\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 628,478.02\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-650,630.22}{628,478.02} \\]\n\nLet's calculate:\n\\[ \\frac{-650,630.22}{628,478.02} \\approx -1.035 \\]\n\nRounded to two decimal places as in the example ('-3.90'), it's '-1.04'.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all three calculations:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04', 'Gross Profit Margin': '56.47%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.04'}}\n```\n\nHowever, let's double-check the Debt to Asset Ratio calculation because the example had '0.14', and our calculation seems quite low at '0.04'. \n\nLooking back at the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are under \"Total Current Liabilities\" which is 628,478.02. There are no long-term liabilities mentioned. So, total liabilities are indeed 628,478.02, and total assets are 14,534,228.78, making the ratio approximately 0.04. \n\nPerhaps in the example, there were additional liabilities not listed separately, but in this problem, it seems correct as is.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04', 'Gross Profit Margin': '56.47%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.04'}}\n```",
