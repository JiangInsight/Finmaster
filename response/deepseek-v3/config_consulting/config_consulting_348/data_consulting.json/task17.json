In this case, it is `-650,630.22`.\n\n2. **Identify the Total Debt**: The total debt is the sum of all liabilities. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" which is `628,478.02`. There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so the total debt is `628,478.02`.\n\n3. **Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the numbers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-650,630.22}{628,478.02} \\approx -1.035\n   \\]\n\n4. **Round the Result**: The ratio is rounded to two decimal places, resulting in `-1.04`.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.04'} }\n```",
