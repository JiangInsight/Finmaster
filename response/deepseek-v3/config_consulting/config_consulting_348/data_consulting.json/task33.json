                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -650,630.22\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 628,478.02\n\nCalculation:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -650,630.22 / 628,478.02 ≈ -1.04\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFirst, we need to determine Total Debt. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities are the current liabilities (Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable), which sum up to Total Current Liabilities = 628,478.02. There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities.\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -650,630.22 / 628,478.02 ≈ -1.04\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:** Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- COGS = 1,249,000.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Ending Inventory = 112,000.00\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00 (assuming no inventory at the start since it's 0)\n\nAverage Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2 = (0 + 112,000) / 2 = 56,000\n\nCalculation:\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 1,249,000 / 56,000 ≈ 22.30\n\n*Note: If the initial inventory was not zero, we'd need that value. Here, it's given as 0, so the calculation stands.*\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (Total Debt) = 628,478.02\n- Total Owner's Equity = 13,905,750.76\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 628,478.02 / 13,905,750.76 ≈ 0.045\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 9,625,738.03\n- Inventory = 112,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 628,478.02\n\nQuick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 9,625,738.03 - 112,000 = 9,513,738.03\n\nCalculation:\nQuick Ratio = 9,513,738.03 / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.14\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = 9,625,738.03\n- Current Liabilities = 628,478.02\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 9,625,738.03 / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.32\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.04', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.04', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '22.30', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05', 'Quick Ratio': '15.14', 'Current Ratio': '15.32'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check the calculations to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -650,630.22 / 628,478.02 ≈ -1.04 ✔\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: Same as above since Total Debt = Current Liabilities ✔\n3. Inventory Turnover: 1,249,000 / 56,000 ≈ 22.30 ✔\n4. Debt to Equity: 628,478.02 / 13,905,750.76 ≈ 0.045 (rounded to 0.05) ✔\n5. Quick Ratio: (9,625,738.03 - 112,000) / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.14 ✔\n6. Current Ratio: 9,625,738.03 / 628,478.02 ≈ 15.32 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The ratios are calculated correctly based on the provided financial statements.",
