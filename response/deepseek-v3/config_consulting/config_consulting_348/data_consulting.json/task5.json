                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Gross Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"Gross Profit Margin\" means. From what I recall, the Gross Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods.\n\nThe formula for Gross Profit Margin is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nWhere:\n- **Gross Profit** = Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold\n- **Total Revenue** is the total income from sales before any expenses are deducted.\n\n### Identifying the Given Values\n\nLooking at the provided income statement:\n\n- **Total Revenue**: 2,869,560.42\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 1,249,000.00\n- **Gross Profit**: 1,620,560.42\n\nWait a minute, the Gross Profit is already given as 1,620,560.42, which is indeed the difference between Total Revenue and COGS (2,869,560.42 - 1,249,000.00 = 1,620,560.42). So, we can directly use the Gross Profit figure provided.\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nNow, plugging the numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,620,560.42}{2,869,560.42} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,620,560.42}{2,869,560.42} \\approx 0.5647 \\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.5647 \\times 100 \\approx 56.47\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nJust to ensure I didn't make a mistake, let's re-calculate:\n\n1. Gross Profit = Total Revenue - COGS = 2,869,560.42 - 1,249,000.00 = 1,620,560.42 (matches the given Gross Profit)\n2. Gross Profit Margin = (1,620,560.42 / 2,869,560.42) * 100 ≈ 56.47%\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Considering the Example\n\nLooking back at the example provided:\n\n- Total Revenue: 5,431,018.59\n- Gross Profit: 1,021,018.59\n- Gross Profit Margin: 18.80%\n\nCalculating:\n\n(1,021,018.59 / 5,431,018.59) * 100 ≈ 18.80%\n\nThis matches the given solution, so my approach seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately 56.47%.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '56.47%'}}\n```",
