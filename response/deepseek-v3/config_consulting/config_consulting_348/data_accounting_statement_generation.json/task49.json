                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to generate a complete cash flow statement based on the provided transactions data. The cash flow statement is divided into three main sections: Operating Activities, Investing Activities, and Financing Activities. However, the given example and the problem to solve focus on Operating and Investing Activities, so we will follow that structure.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Cash Flow From Operating Activities**:\n   - **Net Profit**: Sum of all profits from sales minus expenses.\n   - **Depreciation**: Sum of all depreciation entries.\n   - **(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable**: Sum of all unpaid sales (Account Receivable).\n   - **(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable**: Sum of all unpaid interest receivables.\n   - **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**: Sum of all unpaid purchases (Account Payable) minus paid purchases.\n   - **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: Sum of all unpaid purchases (Account Payable).\n   - **Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable**: Sum of all tax amounts from unpaid sales.\n\n2. **Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: Sum of all fixed asset purchases.\n\n3. **Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n   - **Beginning Balance**: Sum of initial cash and bank deposits.\n   - **Ending Balance**: Beginning balance plus net cash flow from operating and investing activities.\n   - **Net Increase**: Ending balance minus beginning balance.\n\n### Calculations:\n\n1. **Net Profit**:\n   - Sum of all profits from sales: Sum of all `profit` fields in sales transactions.\n   - Sum of all expenses: Sum of all `amount` fields in expense transactions.\n   - Net Profit = Total Profit - Total Expenses.\n\n2. **Depreciation**:\n   - Sum of all `amount` fields in depreciation transactions.\n\n3. **(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable**:\n   - Sum of all `amount` fields in unpaid sales (where `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\" and `receive_method` is \"Account Receivable\").\n\n4. **(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable**:\n   - Sum of all `amount` fields in unpaid interest receivables (where `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\" and `receive_method` is \"Interest receviable\").\n\n5. **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**:\n   - Sum of all `amount` fields in unpaid purchases (where `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\" and `payment_method` is \"Account Payable\").\n\n6. **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**:\n   - Sum of all `amount` fields in unpaid purchases (where `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\" and `payment_method` is \"Account Payable\").\n\n7. **Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable**:\n   - Sum of all `tax_amount` fields in unpaid sales.\n\n8. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**:\n   - Sum of all `amount` fields in fixed asset purchases (where `type` is \"Fixed Assets Purchase\").\n\n9. **Beginning Balance**:\n   - Sum of initial cash and bank deposits (where `type` is \"Cash deposit\" or \"Bank deposit\").\n\n10. **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**:\n    - Net Profit + Depreciation - Increase in Accounts Receivable - Increase in Interest Receivable - Increase in Inventory + Increase in Accounts Payable + Increase in Tax Payable.\n\n11. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n    - - Purchase of Fixed Assets.\n\n12. **Ending Balance**:\n    - Beginning Balance + Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\n\n13. **Net Increase**:\n    - Ending Balance - Beginning Balance.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow From Operating Activities': '0.00', 'Net Profit': '1645141.43', 'Depreciation': '91509.25', '(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-2429482.13', '(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-2672.87', '(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-5090000.00', 'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '1590000.00', 'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '271550.92', 'Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities': '-7259994.10', 'Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '0.00', 'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '300000.00', 'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-300000.00', 'Cash and Cash Equivalents': '0.00', 'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00', 'Ending Balance': '434651.47', 'Net Increase': '-7565348.53'}}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Net Profit**: Calculated as the sum of all profits from sales minus the sum of all expenses.\n- **Depreciation**: Sum of all depreciation entries (`45756.35` + `45752.90`).\n- **(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable**: Sum of all unpaid sales (`Account Receivable`).\n- **(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable**: Sum of all unpaid interest receivables.\n- **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**: Sum of all unpaid purchases (`Account Payable`).\n- **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: Sum of all unpaid purchases (`Account Payable`).\n- **Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable**: Sum of all tax amounts from unpaid sales.\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: Sum of all fixed asset purchases (`300000.00`).\n- **Beginning Balance**: Sum of initial cash and bank deposits (`3000000.00` + `5000000.00`).\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: Net Profit + Depreciation - Increase in Accounts Receivable - Increase in Interest Receivable - Increase in Inventory + Increase in Accounts Payable + Increase in Tax Payable.\n- **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: - Purchase of Fixed Assets.\n- **Ending Balance**: Beginning Balance + Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\n- **Net Increase**: Ending Balance -
