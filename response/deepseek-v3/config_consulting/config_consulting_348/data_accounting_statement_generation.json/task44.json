Fixed assets are typically recorded under transactions labeled as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar in the dataset.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Fixed Asset Purchases**: Look through the transactions for any entries that indicate the purchase of fixed assets. These are usually labeled with types like \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar.\n\n2. **Sum the Amounts**: For each identified fixed asset purchase, sum the amounts to get the total purchase of fixed assets for the period.\n\n3. **Verify Payment Status**: Ensure that the transactions considered are those that have been paid (if the cash flow statement is on a cash basis) or all purchases (if on an accrual basis). In this case, since we're calculating for the cash flow statement, we typically consider paid transactions unless specified otherwise.\n\n### Applying to the Given Data:\n\nLooking at the provided dataset, we can see the following transaction related to fixed assets:\n\n- **Transaction ID**: `FixedAsset20231231001`\n  - **Type**: `Fixed Assets Purchase`\n  - **Amount**: `305354.43`\n  - **Payment Status**: `Paid`\n  - **Payment Method**: `Bank Transfer`\n  - **Supplier**: `Supplier 10`\n  - **Asset Name**: `Storage Facilities4`\n  - **Asset Type**: `Storage Facilities`\n\nThis is the only transaction in the dataset that clearly represents a purchase of fixed assets. \n\n### Final Calculation:\n\nThe total purchase of fixed assets is simply the amount of this single transaction.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '305354.43'} }\n```",
