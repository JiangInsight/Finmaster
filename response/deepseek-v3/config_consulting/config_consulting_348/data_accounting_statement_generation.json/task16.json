Paid-in capital typically represents the amount of money that shareholders have invested in the company in exchange for shares. \n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Paid-in Capital:**\n   - The initial paid-in capital is usually recorded in the initial transactions at the start of the accounting period. \n   - In the given data, the initial transactions with type \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", and \"Fixed Assets\" are likely to represent the initial capital investments.\n   - The amounts for these transactions are:\n     - Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n     - Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n     - Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.0\n   - Summing these up: 3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 = 13,000,000.0\n\n2. **Determine Final Paid-in Capital:**\n   - Paid-in capital typically does not change unless there are additional investments or withdrawals by shareholders. \n   - In the given data, there are no transactions indicating additional investments or withdrawals that would affect the paid-in capital. \n   - Therefore, the final paid-in capital remains the same as the initial paid-in capital: 13,000,000.0\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
