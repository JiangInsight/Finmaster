Typically, these include purchases and sales of fixed assets, investments, and other long-term assets.\n\nFrom the given data, the relevant transactions are:\n\n1. **Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0**: This is an initial fixed asset entry, but it doesn't represent a cash flow (it's likely a balance sheet entry).\n2. **Purchase20231231008 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 300000.0 | 300000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer | Director | Staff |  | 100000.0 | S010 | Supplier 10 | S004 | Enterprise Solution | 3.0 | 100000.0 |  |  |  |  |**: This is a purchase of fixed assets (Enterprise Solution) for 300,000.0, paid via bank transfer.\n3. **Purchase20231231013 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 200000.0 | 200000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer | Director | Staff |  | 100000.0 | S006 | Supplier 6 | S004 | Enterprise Solution | 2.0 | 100000.0 |  |  |  |  |**: This is another purchase of fixed assets (Enterprise Solution) for 200,000.0, paid via bank transfer.\n4. **Purchase20231231023 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 60000.0 | 60000.0 | Paid | Bank Transfer | Director | Supervisor |  | 20000.0 | S003 | Supplier 3 | S003 | Premium Consulting | 3.0 | 20000.0 |  |  |  |  |**: This is a purchase of fixed assets (Premium Consulting) for 60,000.0, paid via bank transfer.\n\nNow, we sum up all the cash outflows for investing activities:\n- 300,000.0 (Purchase20231231008)\n- 200,000.0 (Purchase20231231013)\n- 60,000.0 (Purchase20231231023)\n\nTotal cash outflow = 300,000.0 + 200,000.0 + 60,000.0 = 560,000.0\n\nThere are no cash inflows from investing activities in the given data (no sales of fixed assets or investments). \n\nThus, the net cash flow from investing activities is -560,000.0 (negative because it's an outflow).\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-560000.0'} }\n```",
