This is because the cash flow statement reflects actual cash movements, and only taxes that have been paid will affect the cash flow.\n\nLet's go through the transactions step by step:\n\n1. Identify all sales transactions with payment/receipt_status = \"Paid\".\n2. Sum the tax_amount from these transactions.\n\nHere are the relevant sales transactions with \"Paid\" status and their tax amounts:\n\n- Sale20240105008: tax_amount = 2897.35\n- Sale20240106010: tax_amount = 489.44\n- Sale20240117026: tax_amount = 622.49\n- Sale20240118029: tax_amount = 12732.74\n- Sale20240119031: tax_amount = 10118.06\n- Sale20240120033: tax_amount = 484.40\n- Sale20240126046: tax_amount = 2497.59\n- Sale20240128050: tax_amount = 554.80\n- Sale20240131057: tax_amount = 2828.89\n- Sale20240201061: tax_amount = 103.08\n- Sale20240204069: tax_amount = 2240.80\n- Sale20240204070: tax_amount = 137.86\n\nNow, let's sum these tax amounts:\n\n2897.35 (Sale20240105008)\n+ 489.44 (Sale20240106010)\n+ 622.49 (Sale20240117026)\n+ 12732.74 (Sale20240118029)\n+ 10118.06 (Sale20240119031)\n+ 484.40 (Sale20240120033)\n+ 2497.59 (Sale20240126046)\n+ 554.80 (Sale20240128050)\n+ 2828.89 (Sale20240131057)\n+ 103.08 (Sale20240201061)\n+ 2240.80 (Sale20240204069)\n+ 137.86 (Sale20240204070)\n= 34707.50\n\nTherefore, the \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" is 34707.50.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '34707.50'} }\n```",
