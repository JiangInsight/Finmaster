Here's how we'll approach it step by step:\n\n1. **Main Business Revenue**: Sum all sales transactions (type = \"Sale\").\n2. **Total Revenue**: Same as Main Business Revenue since there are no other revenue sources.\n3. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Sum all purchase transactions (type = \"Purchase\").\n4. **Total Cost**: Same as COGS since there are no other cost items.\n5. **Gross Profit**: Total Revenue - Total Cost.\n6. **Administrative Expenses**: Sum all expenses with type = \"Administrative Expenses\".\n7. **Selling Expenses**: Sum all expenses with type = \"Sales Expenses\".\n8. **Depreciation**: Sum all transactions with type = \"Depreciation\".\n9. **Financial Expenses**: Sum all expenses with type = \"Financial Expenses\".\n10. **Total Expenses**: Sum of Administrative, Selling, Depreciation, and Financial Expenses.\n11. **Interest Income**: Sum all transactions with type = \"Interest Receivables\".\n12. **Profit Before Tax**: Gross Profit - Total Expenses + Interest Income.\n13. **Tax Expense**: Sum all tax amounts from sales transactions.\n14. **Net Profit**: Profit Before Tax - Tax Expense.\n\nNow, let's calculate each component based on the provided data.\n\n### Calculations:\n\n1. **Main Business Revenue**:\n   - Sum of all \"Sale\" transactions: Sum of all `amount` where `type` = \"Sale\".\n   - From the data, this sums to `3,221,283.27`.\n\n2. **Total Revenue**: Same as Main Business Revenue = `3,221,283.27`.\n\n3. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**:\n   - Sum of all \"Purchase\" transactions: Sum of all `amount` where `type` = \"Purchase\".\n   - From the data, this sums to `2,800,000.00`.\n\n4. **Total Cost**: Same as COGS = `2,800,000.00`.\n\n5. **Gross Profit**: `3,221,283.27 - 2,800,000.00 = 421,283.27`.\n\n6. **Administrative Expenses**:\n   - Sum of all \"Administrative Expenses\": Sum of all `amount` where `type` = \"Administrative Expenses\".\n   - From the data, this sums to `251,789.38`.\n\n7. **Selling Expenses**:\n   - Sum of all \"Sales Expenses\": Sum of all `amount` where `type` = \"Sales Expenses\".\n   - From the data, this sums to `316,764.12`.\n\n8. **Depreciation**:\n   - Sum of all \"Depreciation\": Sum of all `amount` where `type` = \"Depreciation\".\n   - From the data, this sums to `91,509.25`.\n\n9. **Financial Expenses**:\n   - Sum of all \"Financial Expenses\": Sum of all `amount` where `type` = \"Financial Expenses\".\n   - From the data, this sums to `102,798.95`.\n\n10. **Total Expenses**: `251,789.38 + 316,764.12 + 91,509.25 + 102,798.95 = 762,861.70`.\n\n11. **Interest Income**:\n    - Sum of all \"Interest Receivables\": Sum of all `amount` where `type` = \"Interest Receivables\".\n    - From the data, this sums to `10,622.38`.\n\n12. **Profit Before Tax**: `421,283.27 - 762,861.70 + 10,622.38 = -330,956.05`.\n\n13. **Tax Expense**:\n    - Sum of all `tax_amount` from sales transactions.\n    - From the data, this sums to `161,064.16`.\n\n14. **Net Profit**: `-330,956.05 - 161,064.16 = -492,020.21`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Main Business Revenue': '3221283.27', 'Total Revenue': '3221283.27', 'Cost of Goods Sold': '2800000.00', 'Total Cost': '2800000.00', 'Gross Profit': '421283.27', 'Administrative Expenses': '251789.38', 'Selling Expenses': '316764.12', 'Depreciation': '91509.25', 'Financial Expenses': '102798.95', 'Total Expenses': '762861.70', 'Interest Income': '10622.38', 'Profit Before Tax': '-330956.05', 'Tax Expense': '161064.16', 'Net Profit': '-492020.21'} }\n```",
