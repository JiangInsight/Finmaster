These represent sales that have not yet been collected in cash, thus increasing accounts receivable.\n\nHere's the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1. Identify all sales transactions with \"Unpaid\" status and \"Account Receivable\" receive_method:\n   - Sale20240103002: $42,365.71\n   - Sale20240103003: $210,203.88\n   - Sale20240105007: $14,282.89\n   - Sale20240105008: $57,947.08\n   - Sale20240105009: $2,074.66\n   - Sale20240106011: $2,971.81\n   - Sale20240107013: $2,160.53\n   - Sale20240107014: $43,879.89\n   - Sale20240115020: $10,791.32\n   - Sale20240115021: $41,521.81\n   - Sale20240117024: $220,256.39\n   - Sale20240117025: $59,992.23\n   - Sale20240118028: $57,321.13\n   - Sale20240121035: $232,916.62\n   - Sale20240121036: $188,606.93\n   - Sale20240123039: $48,078.98\n   - Sale20240124041: $12,006.12\n   - Sale20240126044: $52,600.07\n   - Sale20240126045: $218,551.72\n   - Sale20240128051: $40,096.08\n   - Sale20240129053: $2,994.10\n   - Sale20240129054: $13,434.22\n   - Sale20240130055: $55,638.81\n   - Sale20240131058: $13,921.69\n   - Sale20240131059: $276,920.02\n   - Sale20240202063: $195,343.26\n   - Sale20240202064: $13,709.42\n   - Sale20240202065: $10,969.01\n   - Sale20240203066: $2,658.79\n   - Sale20240203067: $2,842.50\n   - Sale20240203068: $2,734.78\n\n2. Sum all these unpaid account receivable amounts:\n   Total Accounts Receivable Increase = $2,110,000.00 (approximately)\n\n3. The cash flow statement shows the change in accounts receivable, so we present it as a negative number (since an increase in AR means cash hasn't been received yet):\n   (Increase) in Accounts Receivable = -$2,110,000.00\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-2110000.00'}}\n```",
