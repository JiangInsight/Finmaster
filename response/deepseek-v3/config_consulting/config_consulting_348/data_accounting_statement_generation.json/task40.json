This is done by analyzing the purchases and sales transactions to see how much inventory was added and how much was sold.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Purchases (Inventory Added):**\n   - Sum all purchase transactions where inventory was added.\n   - Look for transactions with type \"Purchase\" and sum their amounts.\n\n2. **Identify Cost of Goods Sold (Inventory Removed):**\n   - Sum the \"cost_amount\" from all sales transactions where inventory was sold.\n   - Look for transactions with type \"Sale\" and sum their \"cost_amount\" fields.\n\n3. **Calculate Net Change in Inventory:**\n   - The formula is: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Net Change in Inventory} = \\text{Total Purchases} - \\text{Cost of Goods Sold}\n     \\]\n   - A positive result means inventory increased (cash outflow), and a negative result means inventory decreased (cash inflow).\n\n4. **Apply to Cash Flow Statement:**\n   - The cash flow statement shows the impact of inventory changes on cash flow. An increase in inventory is a use of cash (negative), and a decrease is a source of cash (positive).\n\n### Calculations:\n\n1. **Total Purchases:**\n   - Sum of all purchase amounts:\n     - 60,000 (Purchase20231231001)\n     - 100,000 (Purchase20231231002)\n     - 3,000 (Purchase20231231003)\n     - 5,000 (Purchase20231231004)\n     - 15,000 (Purchase20231231005)\n     - 60,000 (Purchase20231231006)\n     - 10,000 (Purchase20231231007)\n     - 300,000 (Purchase20231231008)\n     - 20,000 (Purchase20231231009)\n     - 5,000 (Purchase20231231010)\n     - 300,000 (Purchase20231231011)\n     - 60,000 (Purchase20231231012)\n     - 200,000 (Purchase20231231013)\n     - 2,000 (Purchase20231231014)\n     - 3,000 (Purchase20231231015)\n     - 40,000 (Purchase20231231016)\n     - 10,000 (Purchase20231231017)\n     - 15,000 (Purchase20231231018)\n     - 60,000 (Purchase20231231019)\n     - 20,000 (Purchase20231231020)\n     - 3,000 (Purchase20231231021)\n     - 10,000 (Purchase20231231022)\n     - 60,000 (Purchase20231231023)\n   - Total Purchases = 60,000 + 100,000 + 3,000 + 5,000 + 15,000 + 60,000 + 10,000 + 300,000 + 20,000 + 5,000 + 300,000 + 60,000 + 200,000 + 2,000 + 3,000 + 40,000 + 10,000 + 15,000 + 60,000 + 20,000 + 3,000 + 10,000 + 60,000 = **1,346,000**\n\n2. **Cost of Goods Sold:**\n   - Sum of all \"cost_amount\" from sales:\n     - 20,000 (Sale20240103002)\n     - 100,000 (Sale20240103003)\n     - 5,000 (Sale20240105007)\n     - 20,000 (Sale20240105008)\n     - 1,000 (Sale20240105009)\n     - 5,000 (Sale20240106010)\n     - 1,000 (Sale20240106011)\n     - 1,000 (Sale20240107013)\n     - 20,000 (Sale20240107014)\n     - 20,000 (Sale20240108015)\n     - 5,000 (Sale20240112018)\n     - 5,000 (Sale20240115020)\n     - 20,000 (Sale20240115021)\n     - 100,000 (Sale20240117024)\n     - 20,000 (Sale20240117025)\n     - 5,000 (Sale20240117026)\n     - 20,000 (Sale20240118028)\n     - 100,000 (Sale20240118029)\n     - 100,000 (Sale20240119031)\n     - 5,000 (Sale20240120033)\n     - 100,000 (Sale20240121035)\n     - 100,000 (Sale20240121036)\n     - 20,000 (Sale20240123039)\n     - 5,000 (Sale20240124041)\n     - 1,000 (Sale20240129053)\n     - 5,000 (Sale20240129054)\n     - 20,000 (Sale20240130055)\n     - 20,000 (Sale20240131057)\n     - 5,000 (Sale20240131058)\n     - 100,000 (Sale20240131059)\n     - 1,000 (Sale20240201061)\n     - 100,000 (Sale20240202063)\n     - 5,000 (Sale20240202064)\n     - 5,000 (Sale20240202065)\n     - 1,000 (Sale20240203066)\n     - 1,000 (Sale20240203067)\n     - 1,000 (Sale20240203068)\n     - 20,000 (Sale20240204069)\n     - 1,000 (Sale20240204070)\n   - Total Cost of Goods Sold = 20,000 + 100,000 + 5,000 + 20,000 + 1,000 + 5,000 + 1,000 + 1,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 + 5,000 + 5,000 + 20,000 + 100,000 + 20,000 + 5,000 + 20,000 + 100,000 + 100,000 + 5,000 + 100,000 + 100,000 + 20,000 + 5,000 + 1,000 + 5,000 + 20,000 + 20,000 + 5,000 + 100,000 + 1,000 + 100,000 + 5,000 + 5,000 + 1,000 + 1,000 + 1,000 + 20,000 + 1,000 = **1,055,000**\n\n3. **Net Change in Inventory:**\n   - Net Change = Total Purchases - Cost of Goods Sold\n   - Net Change = 1,346,000 - 1,055,000 = **291,000**\n\n4. **Cash Flow Impact:**\n   - An increase in inventory (291,000) is a use of cash, so it is shown as a negative value in the cash flow statement.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-291000.00'}}\n```",
