These transactions represent purchases that have not yet been paid, thus increasing the accounts payable balance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Unpaid Purchases with Payment Method \"Account Payable\":**\n   - We need to filter all purchase transactions where:\n     - `type` is \"Purchase\"\n     - `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\"\n     - `payment_method` is \"Account Payable\"\n\n2. **Sum the Amounts of These Transactions:**\n   - For each qualifying transaction, add the `amount` to the total accounts payable.\n\n3. **List of Relevant Transactions:**\n   - From the given data, the following transactions meet the criteria:\n     - `Purchase20231231001`: Amount = 60,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231006`: Amount = 60,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231007`: Amount = 10,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231011`: Amount = 300,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231014`: Amount = 2,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231016`: Amount = 40,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231021`: Amount = 3,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231022`: Amount = 10,000.0\n\n4. **Calculate Total Increase in Accounts Payable:**\n   - Sum of the above amounts:\n     - 60,000 + 60,000 + 10,000 + 300,000 + 2,000 + 40,000 + 3,000 + 10,000 = **485,000.0**\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe total increase in accounts payable is the sum of all unpaid purchases with payment method \"Account Payable\". \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '485000.00'} }\n```",
