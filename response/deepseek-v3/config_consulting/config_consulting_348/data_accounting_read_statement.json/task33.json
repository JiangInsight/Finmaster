                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract two specific line items from the income statement:\n\n1. **Income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities**: This is typically the \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Revenue from Operations\" line item, as it represents the income generated from the entity's primary business activities. In the given problem, this is \"Main Business Revenue\" with the value \"2869560.42\".\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) line item, as it reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the entity. In the given problem, this is \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with the value \"1249000.00\".\n\nThe order of the values in the solution should match the order of the line items as they appear in the income statement. \n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Locate \"Main Business Revenue\" in the income statement and note its value: \"2869560.42\".\n2. Locate \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the income statement and note its value: \"1249000.00\".\n3. Ensure the order of the values in the solution matches the order in the income statement (\"Main Business Revenue\" appears before \"Cost of Goods Sold\").\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2869560.42', 'value2': '1249000.00'} }\n```",
