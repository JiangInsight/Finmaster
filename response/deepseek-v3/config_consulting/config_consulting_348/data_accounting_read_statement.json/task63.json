Balance Sheet\n- **Taxes Payable**: The \"End_amount\" is `143478.02`.\n\n### 2. Income Statement\n- **Total Revenue**: The amount is `2869560.42`.\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: The amount is `-650630.22`.\n\nNow, we can compile these values into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '143478.02', 'value2': '2869560.42', 'value3': '-650630.22'} }\n```",
