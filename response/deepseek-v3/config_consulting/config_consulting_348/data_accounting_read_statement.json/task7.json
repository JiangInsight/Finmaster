Typically, expenses related to the profit or loss statement that appear in the balance sheet include items like \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" which reflects the depreciation expense accumulated over time.\n\nFrom the given balance sheet, the relevant line item is \"Accumulated Depreciation.\" \n\n- The **initial value** of \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is `0.00` as of the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n- The **end value** of \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is `91509.25` as of the end date `2024-02-05`.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '91509.25'} }\n```",
