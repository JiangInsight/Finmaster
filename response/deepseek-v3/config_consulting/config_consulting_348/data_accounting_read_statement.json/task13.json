                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line items and values of total assets that are not expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle. These are typically non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets, long-term investments, and other assets not expected to be converted into cash within a year.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Non-Current Assets**: \n   - Non-current assets are listed in the balance sheet and are not part of the operating cycle. In the given problem, the relevant line items are:\n     - Fixed Assets\n     - Accumulated Depreciation\n     - Total Non-current Assets\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The initial value of non-current assets is given under \"Total Non-current Assets\" at the initial date (2023-12-31). The value is `5000000.00`.\n   - **End Value**: The end value of non-current assets is given under \"Total Non-current Assets\" at the end date (2024-02-05). The value is `4908490.75`.\n\n3. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The \"Total Non-current Assets\" is calculated as Fixed Assets minus Accumulated Depreciation. \n     - Initial: `5000000.00 (Fixed Assets) - 0.00 (Accumulated Depreciation) = 5000000.00`.\n     - End: `5000000.00 (Fixed Assets) - 91509.25 (Accumulated Depreciation) = 4908490.75`.\n\n4. **Exclude Current Assets**:\n   - Current assets (like Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Accounts Receivable, Inventory) are intended for sale or consumption in the normal operating cycle and are not included in the solution.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '4908490.75'} }\n```",
