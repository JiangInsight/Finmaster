Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**: This refers to \"Selling Expenses\" because these expenses are directly related to securing orders and delivering goods/services.\n   - From the problem, \"Selling Expenses\" is `309942.03`.\n\n2. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This refers to \"Depreciation\" because it represents the allocation of an asset's cost over its useful life.\n   - From the problem, \"Depreciation\" is `91509.25`.\n\n3. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This refers to \"Financial Expenses\" because these are costs related to raising funds (e.g., interest on loans).\n   - From the problem, \"Financial Expenses\" is `50283.07`.\n\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period**: This refers to \"Tax Expense\" because it represents the taxes payable or recoverable.\n   - From the problem, \"Tax Expense\" is `143478.02`.\n\nNow, we can fill in the values in the JSON format as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '309942.03', 'value2': '91509.25', 'value3': '50283.07', 'value4': '143478.02'} }\n```",
