This account represents interest that has been earned but not yet received. \n\n1. **Initial Value**: The initial amount of \"Interest Receivable\" is found in the balance sheet under the \"Initial_amount\" column, which is `0.00` as of the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n2. **End Value**: The end amount of \"Interest Receivable\" is found in the balance sheet under the \"End_amount\" column, which is `14575.80` as of the end date `2024-02-05`.\n\nThese values are also corroborated by the \"Interest Income\" line in the income statement, which matches the end value of \"Interest Receivable\" (`14575.80`), indicating that this is the interest accrued but not yet received by the end of the period.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '14575.80'} }\n```",
