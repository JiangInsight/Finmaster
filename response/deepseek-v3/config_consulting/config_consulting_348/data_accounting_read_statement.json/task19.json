I'm going to go through the balance sheet provided and identify the four specific line items we're interested in, along with their initial and end amounts. \n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract the following four line items from the balance sheet:\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received**: This is typically listed as \"Interest Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n2. **Accumulated systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is usually called \"Accumulated Depreciation\".\n3. **Tax payable**: This is listed as \"Taxes Payable\".\n4. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is often labeled as \"Paid-in Capital\".\n\nFor each of these, we'll note the \"Initial_amount\" and \"End_amount\" from the table.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Balance Sheet\nLet's go through the table and pick out these items one by one.\n\n1. **Interest Receivable**:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - End_amount: 14575.80\n\n2. **Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - End_amount: 91509.25\n\n3. **Taxes Payable**:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - End_amount: 143478.02\n\n4. **Paid-in Capital**:\n   - Initial_amount: 13000000.00\n   - End_amount: 13000000.00\n\n### Verifying the Items\nJust to make sure I didn't miss anything:\n- \"Interest Receivable\" is clearly listed with the amounts.\n- \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is present with the given figures.\n- \"Taxes Payable\" is there under liabilities.\n- \"Paid-in Capital\" is under the owner's equity section with the same initial and end amounts.\n\n### Formatting the Answer\nThe solution should be in a JSON format with the keys as 'initial value1', 'end valu1', etc., corresponding to the order of the items listed above.\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '0.00', 'end valu1': '14575.80', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '91509.25', 'initial value3': '0.00', 'end valu3': '143478.02', 'initial value4': '13000000.00', 'end valu4': '13000000.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. Identified \"Interest Receivable\" as the first item: initial 0.00, end 14575.80.\n2. Found \"Accumulated Depreciation\": initial 0.00, end 91509.25.\n3. Located \"Taxes Payable\": initial 0.00, end 143478.02.\n4. Spotted \"Paid-in Capital\": initial 13000000.00, end 13000000.00.\n5. Arranged these in the required JSON format in the specified order.\n\nThis should correctly answer the problem based on the given balance sheet.",
