The value we are interested in is the \"Ending Balance\" of \"Cash and Cash Equivalents.\"\n2. **Locate the Ending Balance**: In the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, there is a line item labeled \"Ending Balance\" with an associated value. This represents the cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period.\n3. **Extract the Value**: From the given problem, the \"Ending Balance\" is listed as \"7349369.78\" on the date \"2024-02-05.\"\n\n### Solution:\nThe value of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period is \"7349369.78.\"\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '7349369.78'} }\n```",
