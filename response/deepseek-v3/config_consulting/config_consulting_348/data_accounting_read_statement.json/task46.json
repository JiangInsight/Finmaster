I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the solution.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nFirst, the task is about analyzing a cash flow statement to extract specific information related to cash flows from investing activities. Here's what we need to do:\n\n1. **Identify the Net Amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents from Investing Activities**: This is the total cash flow generated from activities like acquiring or disposing of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents, as well as receiving interest and dividends.\n\n2. **Decompose this Item into 1 Component Sub-item**: This means we need to find one specific line item within the investing activities that contributes to the net cash flow from investing activities. This sub-item must also come from the input statement.\n\n3. **Output the Final Values**: For both the main item (net cash flow from investing activities) and its sub-item, we need to provide their amounts.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nLet's look at the provided cash flow statement. Here's the relevant part for investing activities:\n\n```\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\n\nFrom this:\n\n- **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: This is the main item we're interested in. Its value is `-0.00`.\n  \n- **Sub-item**: The only line item under investing activities is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of `0.00`. This is the component that makes up the net cash flow from investing activities.\n\n### Verifying the Components\n\nThe net cash flow from investing activities is typically the sum of all individual investing activities. Here, the only activity is the purchase of fixed assets, which is `0.00`, leading to a net of `-0.00` (which is essentially `0.00` but could be a formatting choice).\n\n### Potential Confusion\n\nAt first glance, one might wonder why the net is `-0.00` when the purchase is `0.00`. This could be due to:\n\n- The purchase is an outflow (hence negative), but since it's zero, the net is also zero.\n- Sometimes, financial statements might show `-0.00` to indicate no outflow or inflow, maintaining the convention that purchases are negative.\n\nHowever, mathematically, `-0.00` is the same as `0.00`.\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nGiven that:\n\n- **Main Item (Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities)**: `-0.00`\n- **Sub-item (Purchase of Fixed Assets)**: `0.00`\n\nBut since the example provided in the task shows that the sub-item's value is positive even if it's a purchase (which is typically negative), we'll follow that convention. In the example, \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" was `305354.43`, and it was listed as a positive value in the sub-items, while the net was negative.\n\nTherefore, here:\n\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is `0.00`, so the sub-item value is `0.00`.\n- The net is `-0.00`.\n\n### Formatting the Solution\n\nThe solution should be in the following JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '______', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '______'} }\n```\n\nFrom our analysis:\n\n- `'value'`: `'-0.00'` (net cash flow from investing activities)\n- `'sub_items_sub_item value'`: `'0.00'` (purchase of fixed assets)\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '0.00'} }\n```",
