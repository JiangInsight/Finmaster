This is typically found under the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section of the cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Section**: In the provided cash flow statement, the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section includes the line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which represents cash payments to acquire PP&E and other long-term assets.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is `0.00` as per the given data.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is also `-0.00`, which aligns with the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" being `0.00`. This indicates no cash was spent on acquiring PP&E or other long-term assets during the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'}}\n```",
