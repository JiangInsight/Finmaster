                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to look at the income statement provided and identify the three specific line items we're interested in:\n\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities**: This typically refers to the total revenue generated from the main operations of the business. In the income statement, this is usually labeled as \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue.\" \n\n   - In the given statement, we have both \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue,\" both with the same amount of \"2869560.42.\" Since \"Total Revenue\" is a more comprehensive term, we'll take that as the total income from ordinary activities.\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is essentially the cost associated with the goods that were sold during the period. In accounting terms, this is known as the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\n   - In the statement, \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is listed with an amount of \"1249000.00.\"\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**: These are the expenses related to the general administration and management of the company, not directly tied to production or sales. These are typically labeled as \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n\n   - In the statement, \"Administrative Expenses\" are listed with an amount of \"134173.09.\"\n\nNow, let's compile these into the required JSON format:\n\n- `value1`: Total Revenue = 2869560.42\n- `value2`: Cost of Goods Sold = 1249000.00\n- `value3`: Administrative Expenses = 134173.09\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2869560.42', 'value2': '1249000.00', 'value3': '134173.09'}}\n```",
