The cash flow statement shows changes in inventory, but this reflects the change in inventory levels, not the amount sold.\n   - The income statement's \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is the correct and direct measure of the carrying amount of inventories sold during the period.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The value we are looking for is the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" from the income statement, which is `1249000.00`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1249000.00'}}\n```",
