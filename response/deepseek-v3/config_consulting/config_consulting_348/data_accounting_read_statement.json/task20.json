This is because COGS directly reflects the cost associated with the inventory that was sold to generate revenue.\n\n2. **Identifying the Line Item**: In the provided income statement, we look for the line item labeled \"Cost of Goods Sold\". \n\n3. **Extracting the Value**: The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is the amount we need to extract. \n\n4. **Verification**: \n   - In the example provided, the solution was the value of \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (4410000.00).\n   - In the problem to solve, \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is listed with a value of 1249000.00.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is 1249000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1249000.00'} }\n```",
