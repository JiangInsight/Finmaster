These assets are typically categorized under \"Inventory\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item that represents assets held for sale or in production is \"Inventory\". This is because inventory includes goods that are either finished and ready for sale, in the process of being manufactured, or in production for sale.\n\n2. **Locate the Initial and End Values**:\n   - In the given balance sheet, the \"Inventory\" line item shows:\n     - **Initial_amount**: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - **End_amount**: 112000.00 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n3. **Extract the Values**:\n   - The initial value of inventory is '0.00'.\n   - The end value of inventory is '112000.00'.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '112000.00'} }\n```",
