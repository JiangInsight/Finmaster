I'm going to break it down to understand what we're being asked to do and then find the specific values from the given financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to identify and extract three specific line items from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under \"Paid-in Capital\" or similar headings.\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is usually found in the Income Statement as \"Profit Before Tax\".\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This is likely the increase in \"Accounts Payable\" from the Balance Sheet or the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" from the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThe outputs should be grouped by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement.\n\nGiven the example, the order is:\n- value1: Paid-in Capital (Balance Sheet)\n- value2: Profit Before Tax (Income Statement)\n- value3: Increase in Accounts Payable (Cash Flow Statement)\n\n### Extracting the Values\n\nLet's go through each financial statement to find these values.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, we're interested in \"Paid-in Capital\":\n```\nPaid-in Capital | 13000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 13000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThe \"End_amount\" is `13000000.00`. This is our first value (`value1`).\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nFrom the Income Statement, we need \"Profit Before Tax\":\n```\nProfit Before Tax | 1049228.78 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThe amount is `1049228.78`. This is our second value (`value2`).\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement, we're looking for the increase in Accounts Payable:\n```\nIncrease (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 485000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThe amount is `485000.00`. This is our third value (`value3`).\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the example provided:\n- `value1` was '13000000.00' (Paid-in Capital from Balance Sheet)\n- `value2` was '-1373590.51' (Profit Before Tax from Income Statement)\n- `value3` was '1590000.00' (Increase in Accounts Payable from Cash Flow Statement)\n\nThis matches our understanding, so our approach seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1049228.78', 'value3': '485000.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Identify the required line items**:\n   - Capital contributed by shareholders: Paid-in Capital (Balance Sheet)\n   - Profit before tax: Profit Before Tax (Income Statement)\n   - Increase in accounts payable: Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable (Cash Flow Statement)\n\n2. **Locate each in the respective financial statements**:\n   - Balance Sheet: Paid-in Capital → 13000000.00\n   - Income Statement: Profit Before Tax → 1049228.78\n   - Cash Flow Statement: Increase in Accounts Payable → 485000.00\n\n3. **Order them as per the instructions**:\n   - Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement, then Cash Flow Statement.\n\n4. **Construct the JSON output** with the values in the correct order.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1049228.78', 'value3': '485000.00'}}\n```",
