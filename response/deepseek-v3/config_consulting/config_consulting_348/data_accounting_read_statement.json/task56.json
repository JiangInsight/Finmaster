                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line item and value of the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. This is typically referred to as \"Depreciation\" in financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Sections**: Depreciation can appear in multiple sections of the financial statements:\n   - **Balance Sheet**: Under \"Accumulated Depreciation\" which shows the total depreciation over time.\n   - **Cash Flow Statement**: Under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" where depreciation is added back to net profit.\n   - **Income Statement**: Under \"Total Expenses\" where depreciation is listed as an expense.\n\n2. **Check the Balance Sheet**:\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line shows an \"End_amount\" of \"91509.25\" as of \"2024-02-05\". This represents the total depreciation accumulated up to that date.\n\n3. **Check the Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - The \"Depreciation\" line under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" shows an \"Amount\" of \"91509.25\" as of \"2024-02-05\". This matches the accumulated depreciation from the balance sheet.\n\n4. **Check the Income Statement**:\n   - The \"Depreciation\" line under \"Total Expenses\" shows an \"Amount\" of \"91509.25\" as of \"2024-02-05\". This is the depreciation expense for the period.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The value of depreciation for the period is consistently reported as \"91509.25\" across all relevant sections of the financial statements. This is the value we need to extract.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91509.25'}}\n```",
