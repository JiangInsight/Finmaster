I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the solution.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe're given a cash flow statement with several line items, and we need to:\n\n1. **Identify and extract the specific line item and value of \"net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period.\"** This seems to refer to the change in cash and cash equivalents over the period, which is often labeled as \"Net Increase\" or \"Net Decrease\" in cash.\n\n2. **Decompose this item into 2 component sub-items**, both of which must come from the input statement. Typically, the net change in cash is calculated from the beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents.\n\n3. **Output the final value of the net addition and its two sub-items** in the specified JSON format.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Example\n\nLooking at the provided example:\n\n- The \"Net Increase\" in cash is `-7565348.53`.\n- This is decomposed into two sub-items:\n  - `sub_item value1`: `8000000.00` (which is the \"Beginning Balance\")\n  - `sub_item value2`: `434651.47` (which is the \"Ending Balance\")\n\nThis makes sense because the net increase in cash is calculated as:\n`Ending Balance - Beginning Balance = Net Increase`\n`434651.47 - 8000000.00 = -7565348.53`\n\n### Applying This to the Problem to Solve\n\nNow, let's look at the problem we need to solve:\n\nFrom the cash flow statement provided:\n\n- **Beginning Balance**: `8000000.00`\n- **Ending Balance**: `7349369.78`\n- **Net Increase**: `-650630.22`\n\nLet's verify the calculation:\n`Ending Balance - Beginning Balance = Net Increase`\n`7349369.78 - 8000000.00 = -650630.22`\n\nThis checks out.\n\n### Identifying the Components\n\nSo, the \"Net Increase\" is `-650630.22`, and it's composed of:\n\n1. **Beginning Balance**: `8000000.00`\n2. **Ending Balance**: `7349369.78`\n\nThese are the two sub-items that make up the net addition in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n### Formatting the Answer\n\nThe required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '______', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '______', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '______'} }\n```\n\nFilling in the values:\n\n- `'value'`: `'-650630.22'` (the net increase)\n- `'sub_items_sub_item value1'`: `'8000000.00'` (beginning balance)\n- `'sub_items_sub_item value2'`: `'7349369.78'` (ending balance)\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-650630.22', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '7349369.78'} }\n```",
