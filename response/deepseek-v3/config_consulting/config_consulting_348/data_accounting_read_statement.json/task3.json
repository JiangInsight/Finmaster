This typically refers to \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet, as it represents the money owed to the entity by its customers for goods or services delivered but not yet paid for.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - Look for the line item labeled \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet. This is the standard account that tracks amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" column shows the value at the beginning of the period (initial value).\n   - The \"End_amount\" column shows the value at the end of the period (end value).\n\n3. **Locate the Values in the Given Problem**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, the \"Accounts Receivable\" line item has:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: 2149792.45 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n4. **Verify the Context**:\n   - The initial value is 0.00, which means there were no outstanding receivables at the start of the period.\n   - The end value is 2149792.45, indicating the amount owed to the entity at the end of the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '2149792.45'} }\n```",
