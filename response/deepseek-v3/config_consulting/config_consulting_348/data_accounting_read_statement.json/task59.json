I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the required information.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to extract two specific line items from the provided financial statements:\n\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received**: This is typically found as \"Interest Receivable\" in the balance sheet. It represents interest income that has been earned but not yet received in cash.\n   \n2. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is usually found in the cash flow statement under \"Net Increase\" or similar, representing the net change in cash and cash equivalents over the period.\n\nThe financial statements are grouped in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, we should maintain the original order of line items as shown.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Problem\n\nLet's go through each financial statement to find the required information.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, we're interested in \"Interest Receivable\":\n\n| Account | Initial_amount | Initial_date | End_amount | End_date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Interest Receivable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 14575.80 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThe \"End_amount\" for \"Interest Receivable\" is **14575.80**. This is the interest accrued but not yet received at the end of the period.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nWe don't need anything from the Income Statement for this task, but for completeness, it shows \"Interest Income\" which is related but not the same as \"Interest Receivable\".\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nNow, let's look at the Cash Flow Statement for the net addition in cash and cash equivalents:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Ending Balance  | 7349369.78 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Increase  | -650630.22 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThe \"Net Increase\" is **-650630.22**, which represents the net change in cash and cash equivalents during the period. Even though it's negative (indicating a decrease), it's still the net addition (or in this case, reduction).\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example to ensure we're on the right track:\n\n- **value1 (Interest Receivable)**: '2672.87' matches the \"Interest Receivable\" End_amount in the Balance Sheet.\n- **value2 (Net Increase in Cash)**: '-7565348.53' matches the \"Net Increase\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThis confirms our approach is correct.\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nFrom the problem to solve:\n\n- **value1 (Interest Receivable)**: 14575.80\n- **value2 (Net Increase in Cash)**: -650630.22\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '14575.80', 'value2': '-650630.22'} }\n```",
