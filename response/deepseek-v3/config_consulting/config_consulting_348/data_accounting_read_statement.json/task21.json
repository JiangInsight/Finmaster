In an income statement, this is typically represented by \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Operating Revenue\" because it reflects the income earned from the main operations of the business (e.g., sales of goods or services).\n2. **Other Incomes**: Other line items like \"Interest Income\" or \"Other Income\" are not part of the core operating activities. They are secondary or non-operating incomes.\n3. **Identify the Line Item**: In the given problem, the line item \"Main Business Revenue\" clearly represents the income from core operating activities.\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Main Business Revenue\" is \"2869560.42\".\n\n### Solution:\nThe value of income arising from the entity's core operating activities is \"2869560.42\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2869560.42'}}\n```",
