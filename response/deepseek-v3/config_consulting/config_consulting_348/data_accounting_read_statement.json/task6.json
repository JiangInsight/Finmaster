These items are typically classified as \"Fixed Assets\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: \n   - The balance sheet provided includes a line item labeled \"Fixed Assets,\" which represents tangible assets used in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes.\n   - \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is related to Fixed Assets but represents the cumulative depreciation of these assets over time. It is not the value of the tangible assets themselves.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Fixed Assets\" line shows an initial value of `5000000.00` as of `2023-12-31`.\n   - The end value of \"Fixed Assets\" is `5000000.00` as of `2024-02-05`. Note that this is the gross value before accounting for depreciation.\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line shows an end value of `91509.25`, which reduces the net book value of the fixed assets. However, the task asks for the value of the tangible items themselves, not their net book value. Therefore, we use the gross value of Fixed Assets.\n\n3. **Verify Against Examples**:\n   - The example provided also used the \"Fixed Assets\" line for the initial and end values, ignoring accumulated depreciation for the purpose of this task.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5000000.00'} }\n```",
