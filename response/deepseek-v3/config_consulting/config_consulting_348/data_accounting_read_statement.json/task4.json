This is because it records the interest income that has been earned but not yet received in cash.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: From the balance sheet, the \"Initial_amount\" for \"Interest Receivable\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - **End Value**: The \"End_amount\" for \"Interest Receivable\" is `14575.80` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-02-05`.\n\n3. **Construct the Solution**: The solution should include the initial and end values for the \"Interest Receivable\" line item.\n\nThe final answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '14575.80'} }\n```",
