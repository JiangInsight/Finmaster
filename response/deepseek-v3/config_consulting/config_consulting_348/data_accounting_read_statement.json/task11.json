This information is typically found under \"Retained Earnings\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item we are interested in is \"Retained Earnings,\" which represents the cumulative amount of profits or losses retained in the entity over time.\n\n2. **Locate Initial and End Values**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, the \"Retained Earnings\" line item has:\n     - **Initial_amount**: 0.00 (as of the initial date 2023-12-31)\n     - **End_amount**: 905750.76 (as of the end date 2024-02-05)\n\n3. **Extract the Values**:\n   - The initial value of retained earnings is '0.00'.\n   - The end value of retained earnings is '905750.76'.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '905750.76'} }\n```",
