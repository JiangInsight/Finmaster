                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we're interested in.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to identify and extract three specific line items from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit**: This typically refers to \"Accounts Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet.\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually labeled as \"Financial Expenses\" in the Income Statement.\n3. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is often found as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThe order in which we should present these is:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n### Step 1: Balance Sheet - Accounts Receivable\nLooking at the Balance Sheet provided, we have the following line:\n\n| Account | Initial_amount | Initial_date | End_amount | End_date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Accounts Receivable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 2149792.45 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThe \"End_amount\" for \"Accounts Receivable\" is **2149792.45**. This is the amount owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit.\n\n### Step 2: Income Statement - Financial Expenses\nNow, let's look at the Income Statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Financial Expenses | 50283.07 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThe \"Amount\" for \"Financial Expenses\" is **50283.07**. This represents the financing costs incurred by the enterprise.\n\n### Step 3: Cash Flow Statement - Purchase of Fixed Assets\nFinally, examining the Cash Flow Statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nHere, the \"Amount\" for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is **0.00**. This indicates that there were no cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment during this period.\n\n### Verifying the Order\nJust to ensure we're following the correct order:\n1. Balance Sheet (Accounts Receivable)\n2. Income Statement (Financial Expenses)\n3. Cash Flow Statement (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, compiling these values in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2149792.45', 'value2': '50283.07', 'value3': '0.00'} }\n```\n\n### Double-Checking\nLet me quickly verify each value to ensure no mistakes:\n- **value1 (Accounts Receivable)**: 2149792.45 (correct from Balance Sheet)\n- **value2 (Financial Expenses)**: 50283.07 (correct from Income Statement)\n- **value3 (Purchase of Fixed Assets)**: 0.00 (correct from Cash Flow Statement)\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2149792.45', 'value2': '50283.07', 'value3': '0.00'} }\n```",
