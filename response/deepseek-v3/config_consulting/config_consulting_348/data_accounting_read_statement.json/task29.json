First, we need to identify \"total income arising in the course of an entity's ordinary activities.\" In an income statement, this typically corresponds to \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue\" since these represent income from ordinary operations.\n\n2. In the given statement, we see both \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\" with the same value of 2,869,560.42. This suggests that all revenue comes from the main business operations.\n\n3. The task asks us to decompose this item into 1 component sub-item. Since \"Main Business Revenue\" is already the detailed component that makes up \"Total Revenue,\" we'll use this as our sub-item.\n\n4. Both the initial (Main Business Revenue) and final (Total Revenue) values are the same in this case (2,869,560.42).\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"2869560.42\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value\": \"2869560.42\"}}}\n```",
