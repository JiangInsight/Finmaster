These are typically classified as \"Current Liabilities\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Liabilities**: \n   - Current liabilities are obligations that are expected to be settled within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually within one year). \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Current Liabilities\" are:\n     - Accounts Payable\n     - Taxes Payable\n     - Total Current Liabilities\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Total Current Liabilities\" line item represents the sum of all liabilities expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle.\n   - From the table:\n     - **Initial value**: The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `0.00` (as of 2023-12-31).\n     - **End value**: The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `628478.02` (as of 2024-02-05).\n\n3. **Verify**:\n   - The sum of the individual current liabilities (Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable) at the end date is `485000.00 + 143478.02 = 628478.02`, which matches the \"Total Current Liabilities\" value. This confirms the correctness of the extraction.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '628478.02'} }\n```",
