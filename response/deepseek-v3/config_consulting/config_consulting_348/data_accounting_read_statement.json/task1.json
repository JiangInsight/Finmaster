This typically includes \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" as these are the most liquid assets that can be readily used for daily operations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**:\n   - The balance sheet provided includes \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" under the \"Account\" column. These are the primary line items representing cash available for day-to-day operations.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Cash on Hand\" is `3000000.00`.\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Bank Deposits\" is `5000000.00`.\n   - The total initial cash available is the sum of these two values: `3000000.00 + 5000000.00 = 8000000.00`.\n\n3. **Extract End Values**:\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Cash on Hand\" is `3057369.78`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Bank Deposits\" is `4292000.00`.\n   - The total end cash available is the sum of these two values: `3057369.78 + 4292000.00 = 7349369.78`.\n\n4. **Verify Against Total Current Assets**:\n   - The \"Total Current Assets\" initial value is `8000000.00`, which matches the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" initial values. This confirms our selection of relevant line items.\n   - The \"Total Current Assets\" end value is `9625738.03`, which includes other items like \"Interest Receivable\", \"Accounts Receivable\", and \"Inventory\". Thus, we only consider the cash components for our solution.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The initial value of cash available for day-to-day operations is `8000000.00`.\n   - The end value of cash available for day-to-day operations is `7349369.78`.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '7349369.78'}}\n```",
