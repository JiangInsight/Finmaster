                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three key financial ratios: Return on Equity (ROE), Debt to Asset Ratio, and Gross Profit Margin. I'll go through each one, explaining how to compute them based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Return on Equity (ROE)\n\n**Definition:** ROE measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Shareholder's Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the **income statement**, the **Net Profit** is **963,263.19**.\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**, the **Total Owner's Equity (Shareholder's Equity)** at the end is **13,963,263.19**.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{963,263.19}{13,963,263.19} \\times 100 \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\frac{963,263.19}{13,963,263.19} \\approx 0.069 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.069 \\times 100 \\approx 6.90\\% \\]\n\n**ROE ≈ 6.90%**\n\n### 2. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio indicates the proportion of a company's assets that are financed through debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 967,271.87\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so **Total Liabilities** = Total Current Liabilities = 967,271.87\n- **Total Assets**: 14,930,535.06\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{967,271.87}{14,930,535.06} \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\frac{967,271.87}{14,930,535.06} \\approx 0.0648 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: **0.06**\n\n**Debt to Asset Ratio ≈ 0.06**\n\n### 3. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS), indicating how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- **Gross Profit**: 1,713,437.82\n- **Total Revenue**: 3,025,437.82\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{1,713,437.82}{3,025,437.82} \\times 100 \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,713,437.82}{3,025,437.82} \\approx 0.566 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.566 \\times 100 \\approx 56.63\\% \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: **56.63%**\n\n**Gross Profit Margin ≈ 56.63%**\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '6.90%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Gross Profit Margin': '56.63%'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **ROE**:\n   - Net Profit: 963,263.19\n   - Equity: 13,963,263.19\n   - 963,263.19 / 13,963,263.19 ≈ 0.069 → 6.90% ✔\n\n2. **Debt to Asset Ratio**:\n   - Total Liabilities: 967,271.87\n   - Total Assets: 14,930,535.06\n   - 967,271.87 / 14,930,535.06 ≈ 0.0648 → 0.06 ✔\n\n3. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit: 1,713,437.82\n   - Revenue: 3,025,437.82\n   - 1,713,437.82 / 3,025,437.82 ≈ 0.566 → 56.63% ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The calculations are correct.",
