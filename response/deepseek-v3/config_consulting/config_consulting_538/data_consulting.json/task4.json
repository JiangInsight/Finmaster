                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nFirst, what is the Debt to Equity Ratio? From what I understand, it's a financial metric that compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholders' equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nThis ratio gives an idea of how much debt a company is using to finance its assets relative to the value of shareholders' equity.\n\n### Identifying the Components from the Balance Sheet\n\nNow, looking at the provided balance sheet, I need to identify:\n\n1. **Total Liabilities**: This seems to be the sum of all the company's debts or obligations. In the balance sheet, under liabilities, I see:\n   - Accounts Payable\n   - Taxes Payable\n   - Total Current Liabilities\n\n   The \"Total Current Liabilities\" is given as 967,271.87 at the end of the period (2024-02-05). \n\n   Are there any other liabilities listed? It seems like only current liabilities are mentioned; there's no mention of long-term liabilities like long-term debt. So, for this problem, I'll assume that the total liabilities are just the total current liabilities, which is 967,271.87.\n\n2. **Total Owner's Equity**: This is given directly in the balance sheet as \"Total Owner's Equity\" at the end of the period, which is 13,963,263.19.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nNow, plugging these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{967,271.87}{13,963,263.19} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{967,271.87}{13,963,263.19} \\approx 0.0693 \\]\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 0.0693.\n\n### Verifying the Components\n\nWait a minute, is it correct to assume that total liabilities are only the current liabilities? In the first example provided, the total liabilities were the sum of accounts payable and taxes payable, which equaled the total current liabilities, and that was used to calculate the ratio. \n\nIn our problem, similarly, total current liabilities are the sum of accounts payable (816,000) and taxes payable (151,271.87), which is 967,271.87. There's no mention of long-term liabilities, so it's reasonable to assume that total liabilities equal total current liabilities here.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nSo, the calculation stands:\n\n\\[ \\frac{967,271.87}{13,963,263.19} \\approx 0.0693 \\]\n\nExpressed to two decimal places, that would be 0.07.\n\n### Checking the Example\n\nLooking back at the example provided:\n\n- Total Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\n- Total Owner's Equity: 11,354,858.57\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 â‰ˆ 0.1639, which was given as 0.16.\n\nThis matches, so our approach seems correct.\n\n### Potential Missteps\n\nCould there be other liabilities not listed? Sometimes, balance sheets have sections like \"Long-term Debt\" or \"Other Liabilities.\" Here, only current liabilities are listed, so unless we're missing something, it's safe to proceed with the given numbers.\n\nAlso, is \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" relevant here? That's equal to total assets, which is a check that the balance sheet balances, but not directly used in this ratio calculation.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully going through the balance sheet and performing the calculations, the Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.07.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.07'} }\n```",
