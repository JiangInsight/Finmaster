                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to go through each required ratio one by one, using the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 10,022,038.12\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 967,271.87\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 10,022,038.12 / 967,271.87 ≈ 10.36\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n**Definition:** (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 1,713,437.82\n- Total Revenue = 3,025,437.82\n\nCalculation:\nGross Profit Margin = (1,713,437.82 / 3,025,437.82) * 100 ≈ 56.63%\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Definition:** Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 967,271.87\n- Total Assets (End_amount) = 14,930,535.06\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 967,271.87 / 14,930,535.06 ≈ 0.065 or 6.5%\n\nWait a minute, in the example, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated as Total Liabilities / Total Assets, and Total Liabilities was just the current liabilities since no long-term liabilities were present. Here, it's the same, so the ratio is 967,271.87 / 14,930,535.06 ≈ 0.065 or 6.5%.\n\nBut looking back at the example, their Debt to Asset Ratio was 0.14, which was Total Current Liabilities / Total Assets (1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.14). So, it seems they considered only current liabilities as total liabilities in the absence of long-term liabilities. So, I'll follow the same approach.\n\n### 4. Net Profit Margin\n**Definition:** (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 963,263.19\n- Total Revenue = 3,025,437.82\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (963,263.19 / 3,025,437.82) * 100 ≈ 31.84%\n\n### 5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand (End_amount) = 3,537,257.19\n- Bank Deposits (End_amount) = 4,579,000.00\n- Total Cash and Cash Equivalents = 3,537,257.19 + 4,579,000.00 = 8,116,257.19\n- Current Liabilities = 967,271.87\n\nCalculation:\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = 8,116,257.19 / 967,271.87 ≈ 8.39\n\n### 6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n**Definition:** Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 116,257.19\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (Capital Expenditures) = 0.00\n\nCalculation:\nFCF = 116,257.19 - 0 = 116,257.19\n\nAlternatively, sometimes FCF is considered as the net increase in cash and cash equivalents, which is given as 116,257.19 in the cash flow statement under \"Net Increase\". Both methods give the same result here.\n\n### 7. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Definition:** (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Profit = 963,263.19\n- Total Assets (End_amount) = 14,930,535.06\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (963,263.19 / 14,930,535.06) * 100 ≈ 6.45%\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '10.36', 'Gross Profit Margin': '56.63%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.84%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '8.39', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '116257.19', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '6.45%'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation:\n\n1. Current Ratio: 10,022,038.12 / 967,271.87 = 10.36 ✔\n2. Gross Profit Margin: (1,713,437.82 / 3,025,437.82) * 100 = 56.63% ✔\n3. Debt to Asset Ratio: 967,271.87 / 14,930,535.06 ≈ 0.065 (rounded to 0.06) ✔\n4. Net Profit Margin: (963,263.19 / 3,025,437.82) * 100 ≈ 31.84% ✔\n5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio: (3,537,257.19 + 4,579,000) / 967,271.87 ≈ 8.39 ✔\n6. FCF: 116,257.19 (from operating activities, no capex) ✔\n7. ROA: (963,263.19 / 14,930,535.06) * 100 ≈ 6.45% ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The ratios are calculated correctly based on the provided financial statements.",
