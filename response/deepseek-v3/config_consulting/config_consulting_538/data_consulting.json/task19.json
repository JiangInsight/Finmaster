                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Current Ratio and the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: This measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations with its current assets. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: This shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n   \\]\n   Since we only have the ending inventory (no beginning inventory given, assuming it's zero as per the initial amount), we'll use the ending inventory for simplicity:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Inventory} \\approx \\text{Ending Inventory} = 174,000.00\n   \\]\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet** (as of 2024-02-05):\n\n- **Total Current Assets**: 10,022,038.12\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 967,271.87\n- **Inventory (Ending)**: 174,000.00\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 1,312,000.00\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{10,022,038.12}{967,271.87}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10,022,038.12}{967,271.87} \\approx 10.36\n\\]\n\nSo, the Current Ratio is approximately **10.36**.\n\n### Calculating the Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} = \\frac{1,312,000.00}{174,000.00}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1,312,000}{174,000} \\approx 7.54\n\\]\n\nSo, the Inventory Turnover Ratio is approximately **7.54**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n- **Current Assets**: 10,022,038.12\n- **Current Liabilities**: 967,271.87\n  - 10,022,038.12 / 967,271.87 ≈ 10.36 (correct)\n  \n- **COGS**: 1,312,000\n- **Inventory**: 174,000\n  - 1,312,000 / 174,000 ≈ 7.54 (correct)\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '10.36', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '7.54'} }\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: Normally, we'd calculate average inventory as (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2. However, the beginning inventory is listed as 0.00 in the initial amounts, and the ending is 174,000.00. So, average inventory would be (0 + 174,000) / 2 = 87,000. But in the example provided, they seem to have used the ending inventory directly (since beginning was also zero there). For consistency with the example's approach, I used ending inventory. \n\n  If we use average inventory (87,000), the ratio would be:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1,312,000}{87,000} \\approx 15.08\n  \\]\n  But given the example's method, sticking with ending inventory seems appropriate unless specified otherwise.\n\nGiven that in the example, Inventory Turnover was calculated as COGS / Ending Inventory (since beginning was zero), I'll maintain that approach here, leading to 7.54.\n\nHowever, reviewing the example's calculation:\n\n- Example's COGS: 4,410,000\n- Example's Ending Inventory: 5,090,000\n- Inventory Turnover in example: 1.73 (which is 4,410,000 / 2,545,000, implying average inventory is (0 + 5,090,000)/2 = 2,545,000)\n\nSo, the example actually uses average inventory (beginning + ending)/2, even when beginning is zero.\n\nTherefore, I should adjust my calculation to use average inventory:\n\nAverage Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2 = (0 + 174,000) / 2 = 87,000\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 1,312,000 / 87,000 ≈ 15.08\n\nSo, correcting that:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '10.36', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '15.08'} }\n```\n\nBut the example's initial answer was {'Current Ratio': '4.27', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '1.73'}, which seems to align with:\n\nCurrent Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities = 7,956,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 4.27\n\nInventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory = 4,410,000 / ((0 + 5,090,000)/2) = 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73\n\nSo, applying the same method here:\n\nCurrent Ratio = 10,022,038.12 / 967,271.87 ≈ 10.36\n\nInventory Turnover = 1,312,000 / ((0 + 174,000)/2) = 1,312,000 / 87,000 ≈ 15.08\n\nThus, the correct ratios are:\n\nCurrent Ratio: 10.36\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio: 15.08\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '10.36', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '15.08'} }\n```",
