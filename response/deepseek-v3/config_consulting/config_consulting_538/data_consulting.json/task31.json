                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step to ensure I understand how each is derived from the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Credit Sales (Main Business Revenue)**: 3,025,437.82\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Ending Accounts Receivable**: 1,716,911.17\n- **Initial Accounts Receivable**: 0.00 (since it was 0 at the start)\n\n**Average Accounts Receivable**:\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{Initial AR} + \\text{Ending AR}}{2} = \\frac{0 + 1,716,911.17}{2} = 858,455.585 \\]\n\n**Calculation**:\n\\[ \\frac{3,025,437.82}{858,455.585} \\approx 3.52 \\]\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio was calculated without considering the initial amount (which was also 0). Maybe they just used ending AR. Let me check:\n\nIf we use only ending AR:\n\\[ \\frac{3,025,437.82}{1,716,911.17} \\approx 1.76 \\]\n\nBut the example used average, so I think 3.52 is correct. Maybe the example had a different approach. I'll stick with average unless specified otherwise.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: 116,257.19\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 967,271.87\n\n**Calculation**:\n\\[ \\frac{116,257.19}{967,271.87} \\approx 0.12 \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This seems similar to the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. Sometimes they're the same. Assuming it's the same as above:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nSame as above:\n\\[ \\approx 0.12 \\]\n\nBut in the example, both 'operating cash flow ratio' and 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio' were the same (-3.90). So likely they are the same here.\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Sales}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Sales (Total Revenue)**: 3,025,437.82\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Initial Total Assets**: 13,000,000.00\n- **Ending Total Assets**: 14,930,535.06\n\n**Average Total Assets**:\n\\[ \\frac{13,000,000 + 14,930,535.06}{2} = \\frac{27,930,535.06}{2} = 13,965,267.53 \\]\n\n**Calculation**:\n\\[ \\frac{3,025,437.82}{13,965,267.53} \\approx 0.22 \\]\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures the financial leverage of a company by comparing its total liabilities to shareholders' equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 967,271.87\n- **Total Non-current Liabilities**: Not provided, but looking at the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are current (Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable). So Total Liabilities = 967,271.87\n- **Total Owner's Equity**: 13,963,263.19\n\n**Calculation**:\n\\[ \\frac{967,271.87}{13,963,263.19} \\approx 0.07 \\]\n\n*Wait*, in the example, Debt to Equity was calculated as Total Liabilities / Total Equity, where Total Liabilities were just Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities were listed). So same approach here.\n\n### Verifying Against Example\n\nLooking back at the example:\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover: Net Sales / Average AR = 5,431,018.59 / ((0 + 2,429,482.13)/2) = 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 ≈ 4.47 (matches)\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.90 (matches)\n- Total Asset Turnover: 5,431,018.59 / ((13,000,000 + 13,216,409.49)/2) ≈ 0.41 (matches)\n- Debt to Equity: 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.16 (matches)\n\nSo my calculations seem to follow the same method as the example.\n\n### Final Calculations\n\n1. **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio**: 3.52\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**: 0.12\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio**: 0.12\n4. **Total Asset Turnover Ratio**: 0.22\n5. **Debt to Equity Ratio**: 0.07\n\nBut looking back, for Accounts Receivable Turnover, the example used Net Sales / Average AR. I think I did that correctly. Maybe the initial AR is not zero? Wait, in the problem, initial AR is 0, ending is 1,716,911.17. So average is 858,455.585.\n\nNet Sales: 3,025,437.82\nAverage AR: 858,455.585\nRatio: 3,025,437.82 / 858,455.585 ≈ 3.52\n\nSimilarly, other ratios seem correct based on the method in the example.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.52', 'operating cash flow ratio': '0.12', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.12', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.22', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.07'}}\n```",
