                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Net Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Net Profit Margin is. From what I recall, the Net Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows what percentage of a company's revenue is actual profit after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted. \n\nThe formula for Net Profit Margin is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nSo, to calculate this, I need two numbers:\n1. Net Profit\n2. Total Revenue\n\n### Identifying the Numbers from the Given Data\n\nLooking at the provided income statement:\n\n1. **Total Revenue**: \n   - The table shows \"Total Revenue\" as 3,025,437.82.\n\n2. **Net Profit**: \n   - At the bottom, it lists \"Net Profit\" as 963,263.19.\n\n### Calculating the Net Profit Margin\n\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{963,263.19}{3,025,437.82} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide Net Profit by Total Revenue:\n\n\\[ \\frac{963,263.19}{3,025,437.82} \\approx 0.3184 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.3184 \\times 100 \\approx 31.84\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n- Net Profit: 963,263.19\n- Total Revenue: 3,025,437.82\n\n\\[ 963,263.19 \\div 3,025,437.82 \\approx 0.3184 \\]\n\\[ 0.3184 \\times 100 = 31.84\\% \\]\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\n### Considering the Example\n\nLooking back at the provided example:\n\n- Net Profit: -1,645,141.43\n- Total Revenue: 5,431,018.59\n- Net Profit Margin: -30.29%\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-1,645,141.43}{5,431,018.59} \\approx -0.3029 \\]\n\\[ -0.3029 \\times 100 \\approx -30.29\\% \\]\n\nThis matches the given solution, so my approach seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nFor the given problem:\n\n- Net Profit: 963,263.19\n- Total Revenue: 3,025,437.82\n- Net Profit Margin: 31.84%\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '31.84%'} }\n```",
