                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one using the provided financial statements. I'll go through each calculation step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 116,257.19\n\nFrom the balance sheet (End_amount):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 967,271.87\n\n**Calculation:**  \n116,257.19 / 967,271.87 ≈ 0.12\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 967,271.87 (since there are no non-current liabilities listed)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 13,963,263.19\n\n**Calculation:**  \n967,271.87 / 13,963,263.19 ≈ 0.07\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the Debt to Equity Ratio was calculated using \"Total Current Liabilities\" as the debt, but typically, Debt to Equity uses total liabilities (both current and non-current). Here, since only current liabilities are present, it's correct to use that. So, 0.07 seems correct.\n\nBut looking back at the example, their Debt to Equity was 0.16, which was Total Current Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity (1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57). So following that method, it's consistent.\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 3,025,437.82\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets = 14,930,535.06\n- Average Total Assets = (13,000,000 + 14,930,535.06) / 2 = 13,965,267.53\n\n**Calculation:**  \n3,025,437.82 / 13,965,267.53 ≈ 0.22\n\n*Hmm*, the example had 0.41, which was Total Revenue / End Total Assets (5,431,018.59 / 13,216,409.49). Maybe they didn't average. Let's check both:\n\nUsing End Total Assets:  \n3,025,437.82 / 14,930,535.06 ≈ 0.20\n\nUsing Average: ≈ 0.22\n\nThe formula typically uses average, but sometimes end is used if beginning isn't available. Given that initial is provided, average is better. So 0.22.\n\nBut the example used end, so maybe follow that. Let's stick with end for consistency: 0.20.\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 10,022,038.12\n- Inventory = 174,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 967,271.87\n\n**Calculation:**  \n(10,022,038.12 - 174,000) / 967,271.87 = 9,848,038.12 / 967,271.87 ≈ 10.18\n\n*That seems high*. Let me double-check:\n\nCash on Hand: 3,537,257.19  \nBank Deposits: 4,579,000.00  \nInterest Receivable: 14,869.76  \nAccounts Receivable: 1,716,911.17  \nInventory: 174,000.00 (excluded)  \nTotal Quick Assets = 3,537,257.19 + 4,579,000 + 14,869.76 + 1,716,911.17 = 9,848,038.12\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 967,271.87  \nQuick Ratio: 9,848,038.12 / 967,271.87 ≈ 10.18\n\nYes, that's correct. The company has a lot of cash and receivables compared to liabilities.\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nThis is the same as the first ratio, Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\nFrom earlier:\nOperating Cash Flow = 116,257.19  \nCurrent Liabilities = 967,271.87  \nRatio = 116,257.19 / 967,271.87 ≈ 0.12\n\nBut in the example, both ratios were the same (-3.90), so here it's also 0.12.\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Profit / Average Shareholder's Equity\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 963,263.19\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Owner's Equity = 13,000,000.00\n- End Total Owner's Equity = 13,963,263.19\n- Average = (13,000,000 + 13,963,263.19) / 2 = 13,481,631.60\n\n**Calculation:**  \n963,263.19 / 13,481,631.60 ≈ 0.0714 or 7.14%\n\n*But the example used End Owner's Equity*, not average. Let's check:\n\nUsing End:  \n963,263.19 / 13,963,263.19 ≈ 0.069 or 6.9%\n\nThe formula can use either, but average is more accurate if beginning is available. Given the example used end, maybe follow that: 6.9%.\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since no info on cash sales):\n- Net Sales = 3,025,437.82\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00\n- End Accounts Receivable = 1,716,911.17\n- Average = (0 + 1,716,911.17) / 2 = 858,455.59\n\n**Calculation:**  \n3,025,437.82 / 858,455.59 ≈ 3.52\n\n*The example used End Accounts Receivable*, not average. Let's check:\n\nUsing End:  \n3,025,437.82 / 1,716,911.17 ≈ 1.76\n\nThe formula typically uses average, but if beginning is zero, average is half of end, which might not reflect reality well. Given the example used end, maybe follow that: 1.76.\n\nBut initial is zero, so perhaps sales were all in the period, making average more appropriate: 3.52.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and the example used end, let's use end: 1.76.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter carefully considering each ratio and referring to the example's approach, here's the calculated solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.12', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.07', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.20', 'Quick Ratio': '10.18', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.12', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '6.90%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '1.76'}}\n```\n\n*Reviewing the example's methods:*\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities and Operating Cash Flow Ratio were the same.\n- Debt to Equity used Total Current Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity.\n- Total Asset Turnover used Revenue / End Total Assets.\n- Quick Ratio was (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities.\n- ROE used Net Profit / End Owner's Equity.\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover used Revenue / End Accounts Receivable.\n\nFollowing these, our calculations align with the example's methodology.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.12', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.07', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.20', 'Quick Ratio': '10.18', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.12', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '6.90%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '1.76'}}\n```",
