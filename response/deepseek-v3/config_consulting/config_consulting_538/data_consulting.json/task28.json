                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three ratios: the Debt to Asset Ratio, the Gross Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. I'll go through each one, explaining how to find them using the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Liabilities (Current Liabilities):** 967,271.87\n  - This is the sum under \"Total Current Liabilities\" since there are no non-current liabilities listed.\n- **Total Assets:** 14,930,535.06\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{967,271.87}{14,930,535.06} \\approx 0.0648 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.06\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 1,713,437.82\n- **Total Revenue:** 3,025,437.82\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,713,437.82}{3,025,437.82} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 56.63\\% \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 56.63%\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** 116,257.19\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Current Liabilities:** 967,271.87\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{116,257.19}{967,271.87} \\approx 0.1202 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.12\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Gross Profit Margin': '56.63%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.12'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n   - Liabilities: 967,271.87\n   - Assets: 14,930,535.06\n   - 967,271.87 / 14,930,535.06 ≈ 0.0648 → 0.06 (correct)\n\n2. **Gross Profit Margin:**\n   - Gross Profit: 1,713,437.82\n   - Revenue: 3,025,437.82\n   - (1,713,437.82 / 3,025,437.82) * 100 ≈ 56.63% (correct)\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: 116,257.19\n   - Current Liabilities: 967,271.87\n   - 116,257.19 / 967,271.87 ≈ 0.1202 → 0.12 (correct)\n\nEverything checks out! The final answer is accurate based on the provided financial statements.",
