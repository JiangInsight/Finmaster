                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Gross Profit Margin and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods.\n   \n   **Formula**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**: This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It indicates short-term liquidity.\n   \n   **Formula**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n- Total Revenue: \\$3,025,437.82\n- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): \\$1,312,000.00\n- Gross Profit: \\$1,713,437.82\n\nFrom the **cash flow statement**:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: \\$116,257.19\n\nFrom the **balance sheet** (end of period):\n- Total Current Liabilities: \\$967,271.87\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,713,437.82}{3,025,437.82} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[\n\\frac{1,713,437.82}{3,025,437.82} \\approx 0.5663\n\\]\n\\[\n0.5663 \\times 100 \\approx 56.63\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **56.63%**.\n\n### Calculating Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{116,257.19}{967,271.87}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\n\\frac{116,257.19}{967,271.87} \\approx 0.1202\n\\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately **0.12**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit / Total Revenue = 1,713,437.82 / 3,025,437.82 ≈ 0.5663 → 56.63%\n   - This seems correct.\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**:\n   - Net Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities = 116,257.19 / 967,271.87 ≈ 0.1202\n   - Also correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating both ratios, here's the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '56.63%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.12'} }\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin (56.63%)**: This is quite high, indicating that the company retains a significant portion of revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold. It suggests strong pricing power or efficient production.\n  \n- **Operating Cash Flow Ratio (0.12)**: This ratio is less than 1, meaning the company's operating cash flow isn't sufficient to cover all its current liabilities. This could indicate potential liquidity issues in the short term unless other sources of cash are available.\n\nThese insights can help assess the company's financial health, but it's also important to compare these ratios with industry benchmarks or historical data for a more comprehensive analysis.",
