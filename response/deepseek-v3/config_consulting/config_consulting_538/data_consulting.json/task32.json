                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested metrics one by one based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nFree Cash Flow is typically calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} - \\text{Capital Expenditures} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: \\$116,257.19\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (Capital Expenditures): \\$0.00\n\nSo,\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = 116,257.19 - 0 = 116,257.19 \\]\n\n### 2. Return on Assets (ROA)\nROA measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit. It's calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate Average Total Assets:\n\\[ \\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Total Assets} + \\text{Ending Total Assets}}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Beginning Total Assets} = 13,000,000.00 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Ending Total Assets} = 14,930,535.06 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{13,000,000 + 14,930,535.06}{2} = \\frac{27,930,535.06}{2} = 13,965,267.53 \\]\n\nNow, ROA:\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\frac{963,263.19}{13,965,267.53} \\times 100 \\approx 6.90\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Return on Equity (ROE)\nROE measures how effectively a company uses shareholders' equity to generate profit. It's calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Shareholders' Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nCalculate Average Shareholders' Equity:\n\\[ \\text{Beginning Equity} = 13,000,000.00 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Ending Equity} = 13,963,263.19 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Average Equity} = \\frac{13,000,000 + 13,963,263.19}{2} = \\frac{26,963,263.19}{2} = 13,481,631.60 \\]\n\nNow, ROE:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{963,263.19}{13,481,631.60} \\times 100 \\approx 7.14\\% \\]\n\n### 4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\nThis ratio shows how much cash is generated from operating activities relative to net income.\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{116,257.19}{963,263.19} \\approx 0.12 \\]\n\nWait a minute, this seems low. Let me double-check the numbers:\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities is indeed \\$116,257.19, and Net Profit is \\$963,263.19. So, the ratio is:\n\\[ \\frac{116,257.19}{963,263.19} \\approx 0.12 \\]\n\nBut in the example provided, the ratio was greater than 1, which makes me think maybe I'm missing something. Maybe it's the absolute values or perhaps the ratio is supposed to be Net Income / Operating Cash Flow? But typically, it's Operating Cash Flow / Net Income to see how much cash is generated per dollar of income.\n\nGiven that, 0.12 seems correct, meaning that for every dollar of net income, only \\$0.12 is generated in operating cash flow, which might indicate significant non-cash items or changes in working capital affecting cash flow.\n\n### 5. Net Profit Margin\nThis shows how much of each dollar of revenue is profit.\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n\\[ \\text{Total Revenue} = 3,025,437.82 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit} = 963,263.19 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{963,263.19}{3,025,437.82} \\times 100 \\approx 31.84\\% \\]\n\n### 6. Gross Profit Margin\nThis shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold.\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit} = 1,713,437.82 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Revenue} = 3,025,437.82 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{1,713,437.82}{3,025,437.82} \\times 100 \\approx 56.63\\% \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, compiling all these calculations into the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '116257.19', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '6.90%', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '7.14%', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '0.12', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.84%', 'Gross Profit Margin': '56.63%'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\nLet me quickly verify a couple of things to ensure accuracy:\n\n1. **FCF**: Operating cash flow is \\$116,257.19, and there are no capital expenditures, so FCF is correct.\n2. **ROA**: Net profit is \\$963,263.19, average assets are ~\\$13.965M, so 963k / ~13.965M ≈ 6.9% seems correct.\n3. **ROE**: Net profit same, average equity ~\\$13.482M, 963k / ~13.482M ≈ 7.14% correct.\n4. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income**: 116k / 963k ≈ 0.12. This seems low, but the numbers are correct based on the statements.\n5. **Net Profit Margin**: 963k / 3,025k ≈ 31.84% correct.\n6. **Gross Profit Margin**: 1,713k / 3,025k ≈ 56.63% correct.\n\nEverything checks out! The Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is notably low, which might be due to significant increases in accounts receivable and inventory (as seen in the cash flow statement), which are uses of cash not reflected in net income. This makes sense given the numbers.",
