                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial task step by step. I'm going to calculate two ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: This ratio measures a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   Here, \"Total Debt\" can be considered as the \"Total Current Liabilities\" since that's the debt that needs to be paid in the short term.\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Numbers\n\nFrom the **Income Statement**:\n- **Total Revenue**: 3,025,437.82\n- **Gross Profit**: 1,713,437.82\n\nFrom the **Cash Flow Statement**:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: 116,257.19\n\nFrom the **Balance Sheet**:\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 967,271.87 (This is our \"Total Debt\" for this calculation)\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,713,437.82}{3,025,437.82} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\\[\n\\frac{1,713,437.82}{3,025,437.82} \\approx 0.5663\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\\[\n0.5663 \\times 100 \\approx 56.63\\%\n\\]\n\n### Calculating Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{116,257.19}{967,271.87}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{116,257.19}{967,271.87} \\approx 0.1202\n\\]\n\nThis can be presented as is or rounded to two decimal places: 0.12\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit: 1,713,437.82\n   - Total Revenue: 3,025,437.82\n   - 1,713,437.82 / 3,025,437.82 ≈ 0.5663 → 56.63%\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   - Operating Cash Flow: 116,257.19\n   - Total Current Liabilities: 967,271.87\n   - 116,257.19 / 967,271.87 ≈ 0.1202\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '56.63%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.12'}}\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin**: A margin of 56.63% is quite healthy, indicating that the company retains a significant portion of revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold.\n  \n- **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: A ratio of 0.12 means that the company's operating cash flow is 12% of its current liabilities. This suggests that the company generates enough cash to cover about 12% of its short-term debt in the given period. Ideally, a higher ratio is better, indicating stronger ability to cover debts with operating cash. \n\nIf there were long-term liabilities, we might include those in the total debt for a more comprehensive ratio, but based on the provided balance sheet, only current liabilities are present.\n\n### Potential Missteps\n\nInitially, I wondered if \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" should be considered as the denominator for the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio. However, that includes equity, which isn't debt. So, sticking with \"Total Current Liabilities\" makes more sense for this context.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the numbers are correctly pulled from the right statements is crucial. For instance, \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" is distinct from \"Net Profit,\" and using the wrong one would lead to incorrect calculations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully extracting the relevant figures and performing the calculations, the final ratios are as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '56.63%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.12'}}\n```",
