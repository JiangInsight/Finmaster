                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. We have three financial statements: the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement. We need to calculate three ratios:\n\n1. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio**\n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio**\n3. **Quick Ratio**\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how much cash flow is generated from operating activities relative to the net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 116,257.19\n- Net Profit (from income statement) = 963,263.19\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{116,257.19}{963,263.19} \\approx 0.1207 \\]\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the ratio was greater than 1, which suggests that maybe we take the absolute value or perhaps there's a different interpretation. However, based on the definition, it's simply operating cash flow divided by net income. \n\nWait, in the example, the net profit was negative, and the operating cash flow was also negative, resulting in a positive ratio greater than 1. Here, both are positive, so the ratio is positive but less than 1.\n\nSo, calculating:\n\n\\[ \\frac{116,257.19}{963,263.19} \\approx 0.12 \\]\n\nBut the example had it as '4.41', which seems to be the absolute value or perhaps the inverse. Maybe it's Net Income / Operating Cash Flow? But that doesn't make sense because in the example, -1,645,141.43 / -7,259,994.10 ≈ 0.226, not 4.41.\n\nWait, maybe it's Operating Cash Flow / Net Income, but in the example, -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41. That checks out. So, same here:\n\n116,257.19 / 963,263.19 ≈ 0.12\n\nBut the example had a higher ratio when both were negative. Maybe the ratio is always presented as a positive number representing how many times the operating cash flow covers the net income. So, absolute values?\n\nBut in our case, both are positive, so the ratio is 0.12. Maybe the answer is '0.12'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's supposed to be Operating Cash Flow / Net Income, and if net income is negative, it's still the same division. In the example, -7.26 / -1.65 = 4.41. Here, 0.116 / 0.963 = 0.12.\n\nSo, '0.12' seems correct.\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}} \\]\n\nSince we only have the ending current assets (not the average), we'll use the ending current assets for simplicity unless instructed otherwise.\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 3,025,437.82\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Assets = 10,022,038.12\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{3,025,437.82}{10,022,038.12} \\approx 0.30 \\]\n\nBut in the example, it was '0.68', which was calculated as Total Revenue / End Current Assets (5,431,018.59 / 7,956,806.47 ≈ 0.68). So, same here:\n\n3,025,437.82 / 10,022,038.12 ≈ 0.30\n\n### 3. Quick Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Cash on Hand = 3,537,257.19\n- Bank Deposits = 4,579,000.00\n- Interest Receivable = 14,869.76\n- Accounts Receivable = 1,716,911.17\n- Current Liabilities = 967,271.87\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable (assuming Interest Receivable is included, but typically it's Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable; Marketable Securities might be part of Bank Deposits if they're short-term)\n\nAssuming:\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable\n= 3,537,257.19 + 4,579,000.00 + 1,716,911.17 = 9,833,168.36\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{9,833,168.36}{967,271.87} \\approx 10.17 \\]\n\nBut in the example, it was '1.54', calculated as (Cash + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities = (270,005.90 + 164,645.57 + 2,429,482.13) / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54.\n\nSo, same here:\n\n(3,537,257.19 + 4,579,000.00 + 1,716,911.17) / 967,271.87 ≈ 10.17\n\nThis seems unusually high. Maybe Interest Receivable is not included, but even then, it's still very high. Maybe Bank Deposits are not considered quick assets? But in the example, they were included.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only Cash on Hand and Bank Deposits are considered, excluding Accounts Receivable, but that contradicts the example.\n\nWait, in the example, Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable were used. So same here.\n\nPerhaps the current liabilities are understated or the quick assets are very high in this case.\n\nGiven the numbers, the calculation seems correct based on the example's method.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter calculating:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = 0.12\n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio = 0.30\n3. Quick Ratio = 10.17\n\nBut the quick ratio seems unusually high; maybe there's a mistake. Let me recheck:\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable\n= 3,537,257.19 + 4,579,000.00 + 1,716,911.17 = 9,833,168.36\n\nCurrent Liabilities = 967,271.87\n\n9,833,168.36 / 967,271.87 ≈ 10.17\n\nThe numbers seem correct based on the provided data.\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the quick ratio was (Cash + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities, which matches our method. Maybe in this case, the company has a lot of liquid assets compared to liabilities.\n\nSo, the final ratios are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '0.12', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.30', 'Quick Ratio': '10.17'}}\n```",
