                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one using the provided financial statements. I'll go through each ratio, explain what it is, and then calculate it step by step.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 116,257.19\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 967,271.87\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{116,257.19}{967,271.87} \\approx 0.12 \\]\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to determine Total Debt. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are:\n- Accounts Payable = 816,000.00\n- Taxes Payable = 151,271.87\nTotal Current Liabilities = 967,271.87 (which seems to be the total debt in this case since no long-term debt is mentioned)\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{116,257.19}{967,271.87} \\approx 0.12 \\]\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 1,312,000.00\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Ending Inventory = 174,000.00\nAssuming no beginning inventory (since initial amount is 0), Average Inventory = (0 + 174,000) / 2 = 87,000\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{1,312,000}{87,000} \\approx 15.08 \\]\n\nWait a minute, the initial inventory is 0, and end is 174,000. If the company started with no inventory and ended with some, the average might just be the ending inventory if we're looking at a point where inventory was built up during the period. Alternatively, if the initial is truly zero and all inventory was purchased during the period, then average might be ending/2. But given the initial is zero, it's more accurate to use ending inventory as the average might not be representative. Maybe better to use ending inventory directly for this calculation unless we have purchases data.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes it's calculated as COGS / Ending Inventory if beginning is zero:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,312,000}{174,000} \\approx 7.54 \\]\n\nBut looking at standard formulas, average is preferred. Given initial is zero, average is 87,000, so 1,312,000 / 87,000 ≈ 15.08. But this seems high. Maybe initial inventory is not zero but not reported? Wait, initial is given as 0, so perhaps inventory was all purchased during the period. Maybe better to use ending inventory.\n\nAlternatively, if we think that the inventory was all purchased during the period and then sold, the turnover would be high. Maybe 15.08 is correct.\n\nBut looking at the example provided, their inventory turnover was COGS / Ending Inventory (4410000 / 5090000 ≈ 0.87, but they got 1.73, which suggests they might have used average inventory where initial was zero, so average is 5090000/2, so 4410000 / 2545000 ≈ 1.73).\n\nSo following that method:\n\nAverage Inventory = (Initial + Ending) / 2 = (0 + 174,000) / 2 = 87,000\nCOGS = 1,312,000\nInventory Turnover = 1,312,000 / 87,000 ≈ 15.08\n\nBut this seems unusually high. Maybe initial inventory is not zero but not reported? Alternatively, maybe the initial inventory is not part of the current period's calculation. Maybe better to use ending inventory only.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial inventory is not zero but not given, so we can't calculate average. Maybe in practice, if initial is not given, use ending.\n\nGiven the example seems to use average even when initial is zero, let's stick with that:\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio ≈ 15.08\n\nBut this seems too high, maybe a mistake. Wait, if initial is zero and all inventory was purchased and then sold, then COGS would equal purchases, and ending inventory is what's left, so turnover is high. Maybe correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial inventory is not zero but not reported, so we can't calculate average. Maybe better to assume ending inventory is the average.\n\nGiven confusion, let's follow the example's method where initial is zero and they used average:\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio = COGS / Average Inventory = 1,312,000 / 87,000 ≈ 15.08\n\nBut seems high, maybe correct given initial is zero.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholders' equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 967,271.87\n- No long-term liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = 967,271.87\n- Total Owner's Equity = 13,963,263.19\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{967,271.87}{13,963,263.19} \\approx 0.07 \\]\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to meet short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets} - \\text{Inventory}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 10,022,038.12\n- Inventory = 174,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 967,271.87\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{10,022,038.12 - 174,000}{967,271.87} = \\frac{9,848,038.12}{967,271.87} \\approx 10.18 \\]\n\nThis seems very high, which might indicate a very strong liquidity position.\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to pay short-term obligations with current assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = 10,022,038.12\n- Current Liabilities = 967,271.87\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{10,022,038.12}{967,271.87} \\approx 10.36 \\]\n\nAgain, this is very high, indicating strong liquidity.\n\n### Reviewing Calculations:\nSome ratios seem unusually high (Inventory Turnover, Quick Ratio, Current Ratio). Let's double-check:\n\n- **Inventory Turnover:** If initial inventory is truly zero, then average is ending/2, so 1,312,000 / 87,000 ≈ 15.08. Maybe correct if the company turned over inventory many times in the period.\n  \n- **Quick Ratio and Current Ratio:** The company has a lot of cash and receivables compared to liabilities, so high ratios might be correct.\n\nGiven that, here's the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.12', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.12', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '15.08', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.07', 'Quick Ratio': '10.18', 'Current Ratio': '10.36'}}\n```\n\nHowever, comparing with the example, their Inventory Turnover was lower despite similar initial inventory being zero. Maybe the correct approach is to use ending inventory only when initial is zero. Let's try that:\n\nInventory Turnover = COGS / Ending Inventory = 1,312,000 / 174,000 ≈ 7.54\n\nThis seems more reasonable. Maybe the example had a typo in their calculation. Let's go with 7.54.\n\nUpdating:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.12', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.12', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '7.54', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.07', 'Quick Ratio': '10.18', 'Current Ratio': '10.36'}}\n```\n\nBut the example used average inventory even when initial was zero, leading to a lower ratio. Maybe their COGS was for a longer period. Given that, perhaps our high ratio is correct if the period is short and inventory turned over many times.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial inventory is not zero but not reported, so we can't calculate average. Then we'd use ending inventory only, giving 7.54.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and since the example used average when initial was zero, let's stick with average:\n\nInventory Turnover = 15.08\n\nBut this seems unrealistic. Maybe the correct interpretation is that initial inventory is not zero but not provided, so we can't calculate average, hence use ending inventory only: 7.54.\n\nGiven that, final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.12', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.12', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '7.54', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.07', 'Quick Ratio': '10.18', 'Current Ratio': '10.36'}}\n```\n\nThis seems more reasonable, with Inventory Turnover at 7.54. The high Quick and Current ratios are due to large cash and receivables relative to small liabilities.",
