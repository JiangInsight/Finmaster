                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'll go through each ratio one by one, explaining how to calculate it using the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Assets (End_amount):** 10,022,038.12\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 967,271.87\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 10,022,038.12 / 967,271.87 ≈ 10.36\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Definition:** Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Current Assets:** 10,022,038.12\n- **Inventory (End_amount):** 174,000.00\n- **Current Liabilities:** 967,271.87\n\nCalculation:\nQuick Assets = 10,022,038.12 - 174,000.00 = 9,848,038.12\nQuick Ratio = 9,848,038.12 / 967,271.87 ≈ 10.18\n\n*Wait a minute, this seems unusually high, similar to the Current Ratio. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the components of Current Assets.*\n\nLooking at the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand: 3,537,257.19\n- Bank Deposits: 4,579,000.00\n- Interest Receivable: 14,869.76\n- Accounts Receivable: 1,716,911.17\n- Inventory: 174,000.00\nTotal: 3,537,257.19 + 4,579,000 + 14,869.76 + 1,716,911.17 + 174,000 = 10,022,038.12 (matches)\n\nQuick Assets typically exclude inventory and sometimes other less liquid current assets. Here, it's just inventory that's excluded. So the calculation seems correct, but the ratio is indeed very high, indicating a lot of liquid assets relative to liabilities.\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Definition:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Liabilities:** This seems to be just the \"Total Current Liabilities\" since there are no non-current liabilities listed. So, 967,271.87\n- **Total Assets (End_amount):** 14,930,535.06\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 967,271.87 / 14,930,535.06 ≈ 0.0648 or 0.065\n\n*But in the example, \"Debt to Asset Ratio\" was calculated using Total Current Liabilities as the debt. If there are no long-term debts, then this seems correct.*\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Liabilities:** 967,271.87\n- **Total Owner's Equity (End_amount):** 13,963,263.19\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 967,271.87 / 13,963,263.19 ≈ 0.0693 or 0.069\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** 116,257.19\n- **Total Debt:** Assuming this is Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term debt is listed): 967,271.87\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = 116,257.19 / 967,271.87 ≈ 0.1202 or 0.12\n\n*This seems a bit low compared to the example where it was negative. Maybe the company is generating positive cash flow relative to its debt.*\n\n### Verifying Calculations:\nLet me double-check the components to ensure I didn't miss anything.\n\n- **Current Ratio:** 10,022,038.12 / 967,271.87 = 10.36\n- **Quick Ratio:** (10,022,038.12 - 174,000) / 967,271.87 = 9,848,038.12 / 967,271.87 = 10.18\n- **Debt to Asset:** 967,271.87 / 14,930,535.06 = 0.065\n- **Debt to Equity:** 967,271.87 / 13,963,263.19 = 0.069\n- **Cash Flow to Debt:** 116,257.19 / 967,271.87 = 0.12\n\nEverything checks out. The company has a very high current and quick ratio, indicating strong liquidity. The debt ratios are low, showing minimal debt relative to assets and equity. The cash flow to debt ratio is positive, indicating that operating cash flow can cover a portion of the debt.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '10.36', 'Quick Ratio': '10.18', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.065', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.069', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.12'}}\n```",
