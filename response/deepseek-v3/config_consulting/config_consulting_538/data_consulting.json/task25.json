                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Equity Ratio, the Net Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures the proportion of debt financing relative to equity financing. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 967,271.87\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 967,271.87\n- **Total Owner's Equity**: 13,963,263.19\n\nNow, plug in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{967,271.87}{13,963,263.19} \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{967,271.87}{13,963,263.19} \\approx 0.0693 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.07.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition**: This ratio shows how much net profit is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit**: 963,263.19\n- **Total Revenue**: 3,025,437.82\n\nNow, plug in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{963,263.19}{3,025,437.82} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{963,263.19}{3,025,437.82} \\approx 0.3184 \\]\n\\[ 0.3184 \\times 100 \\approx 31.84\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is approximately 31.84%.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: 116,257.19\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 967,271.87\n\nNow, plug in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{116,257.19}{967,271.87} \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{116,257.19}{967,271.87} \\approx 0.1202 \\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio is approximately 0.12.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.07', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.84%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.12'} }\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the ratios were given with two decimal places for the Debt to Equity and Operating Cash Flow ratios, and two decimal places for the Net Profit Margin percentage. To match that format, I'll round accordingly:\n\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.07 (already at two decimal places)\n- Net Profit Margin: 31.84% (already at two decimal places)\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: 0.12 (already at two decimal places)\n\nSo, the final answer remains:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.07', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.84%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.12'} }\n```",
