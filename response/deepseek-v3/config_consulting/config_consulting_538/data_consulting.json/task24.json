                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate two ratios: the Debt to Asset Ratio and the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities listed) = 967,271.87\n- Total Assets = 14,930,535.06\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{967,271.87}{14,930,535.06} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{967,271.87}{14,930,535.06} \\approx 0.0648 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.0648 or 6.48%. \n\nBut looking at the example provided, the ratio was given as '0.14', which is a decimal representation. So, we'll present it similarly as '0.06' (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nWait, let me check if there are any other liabilities. The balance sheet shows \"Total Current Liabilities\" as 967,271.87, and there's no mention of long-term liabilities. So, total liabilities are just the current liabilities.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the operating cash flow to the net income, indicating how well net income is being converted into cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 116,257.19\n- Net Profit (from Income Statement) = 963,263.19\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{116,257.19}{963,263.19} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{116,257.19}{963,263.19} \\approx 0.1207 \\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is approximately 0.12.\n\nBut in the example, the ratio was '4.41', which seems higher. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the cash flow components.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement:\n- Net Profit: 963,263.19\n- Depreciation: 91,503.06\n- (Increase) in Accounts Receivable: -1,716,911.17\n- (Increase) in Interest Receivable: -14,869.76\n- (Increase) in Inventory: -174,000.00\n- Increase in Accounts Payable: 816,000.00\n- Increase in Tax Payable: 151,271.87\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: 116,257.19\n\nThis seems correct. The net cash flow is indeed 116,257.19, and net profit is 963,263.19, so the ratio is 0.12.\n\nPerhaps in the example, the net cash flow was negative and larger in magnitude compared to net income, leading to a higher ratio. Here, the cash flow is positive but smaller than net income, hence a ratio less than 1.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '0.12'} }\n```\n\n**Wait a minute!** \n\nLooking back at the example, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated as Total Liabilities / Total Assets, which in the example was:\n\nTotal Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\nTotal Assets: 13,216,409.49\nRatio: 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.14\n\nSimilarly, here:\n\nTotal Liabilities: 967,271.87\nTotal Assets: 14,930,535.06\nRatio: 967,271.87 / 14,930,535.06 ≈ 0.0648, so '0.06' is correct when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nFor the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:\n\nExample:\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,259,994.10\nNet Profit: -1,645,141.43\nRatio: -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41\n\nHere:\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: 116,257.19\nNet Profit: 963,263.19\nRatio: 116,257.19 / 963,263.19 ≈ 0.12\n\nSo, the calculations seem correct based on the given data. \n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '0.12'} }\n```",
