                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios: the Quick Ratio and the Net Profit Margin. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Quick Ratio (also known as the Acid-Test Ratio):**\n   - This measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n   - Formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets} - \\text{Inventory}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n     \\]\n   - Here, \"Current Assets\" include cash, bank deposits, interest receivable, and accounts receivable. \"Inventory\" is excluded because it's not as liquid.\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - This shows how much of each dollar of revenue is translated into profit.\n   - Formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n     \\]\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the provided financial statements, let's pick out the numbers we need.\n\n**Balance Sheet (End amounts as of 2024-02-05):**\n- **Current Assets:**\n  - Cash on Hand: 3,537,257.19\n  - Bank Deposits: 4,579,000.00\n  - Interest Receivable: 14,869.76\n  - Accounts Receivable: 1,716,911.17\n  - Inventory: 174,000.00\n  - Total Current Assets: 10,022,038.12\n- **Current Liabilities:**\n  - Accounts Payable: 816,000.00\n  - Taxes Payable: 151,271.87\n  - Total Current Liabilities: 967,271.87\n\n**Income Statement:**\n- Total Revenue: 3,025,437.82\n- Net Profit: 963,263.19\n\n### Calculating the Quick Ratio\n\nFirst, identify the liquid current assets (excluding inventory):\n\\[\n\\text{Liquid Current Assets} = \\text{Cash on Hand} + \\text{Bank Deposits} + \\text{Interest Receivable} + \\text{Accounts Receivable}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 3,537,257.19 + 4,579,000.00 + 14,869.76 + 1,716,911.17\n\\]\nLet's add these up:\n- 3,537,257.19 + 4,579,000.00 = 8,116,257.19\n- 8,116,257.19 + 14,869.76 = 8,131,126.95\n- 8,131,126.95 + 1,716,911.17 = 9,848,038.12\n\nWait a minute, the total current assets are given as 10,022,038.12, and we have inventory at 174,000.00. So:\n\\[\n\\text{Liquid Current Assets} = \\text{Total Current Assets} - \\text{Inventory} = 10,022,038.12 - 174,000.00 = 9,848,038.12\n\\]\nThis matches our manual addition, so that's correct.\n\nNow, the Quick Ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{9,848,038.12}{967,271.87}\n\\]\nLet's do the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{9,848,038.12}{967,271.87} \\approx 10.18\n\\]\nHmm, that seems quite high. Let me double-check the numbers.\n\nWait, looking back at the balance sheet, the \"Total Current Assets\" is 10,022,038.12, which includes inventory. So liquid current assets are indeed total current assets minus inventory:\n\\[\n10,022,038.12 - 174,000.00 = 9,848,038.12\n\\]\nCurrent liabilities are correctly 967,271.87.\n\nSo the calculation seems correct. A quick ratio of ~10.18 means the company has $10.18 in liquid assets for every $1 of current liabilities, which is extremely high. Maybe the inventory is already excluded in the given current assets? But no, inventory is listed separately and is part of current assets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Total Current Assets\" is just the sum of the listed current assets, which are:\nCash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable + Inventory = 3,537,257.19 + 4,579,000.00 + 14,869.76 + 1,716,911.17 + 174,000.00 = ?\n\nAdding these:\n3,537,257.19 + 4,579,000.00 = 8,116,257.19\n+ 14,869.76 = 8,131,126.95\n+ 1,716,911.17 = 9,848,038.12\n+ 174,000.00 = 10,022,038.12\n\nThis matches the \"Total Current Assets\", so inventory is included. Therefore, our initial calculation is correct.\n\n### Calculating the Net Profit Margin\n\nGiven:\n- Net Profit = 963,263.19\n- Total Revenue = 3,025,437.82\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{963,263.19}{3,025,437.82} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\nCalculating the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{963,263.19}{3,025,437.82} \\approx 0.3184\n\\]\nMultiply by 100%:\n\\[\n0.3184 \\times 100\\% \\approx 31.84\\%\n\\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nGiven that in the example provided, the Net Profit Margin was negative (-30.29%) because the net profit was negative, here it's positive, so 31.84% seems plausible.\n\nThe Quick Ratio in the example was 1.54, which is much lower than our calculation of ~10.18. This suggests that in our case, the company has a very high amount of liquid assets relative to its current liabilities, which might be unusual but possible if the company is very cash-rich or has just received a large inflow of cash.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating:\n\n- **Quick Ratio:** 10.18\n- **Net Profit Margin:** 31.84%\n\nExpressed in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '10.18', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.84%'} }\n```",
