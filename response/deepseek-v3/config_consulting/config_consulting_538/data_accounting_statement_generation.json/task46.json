These are the starting balances for the cash flow statement.\n\nFrom the problem data:\n1. \"Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 3000000.0 | 3000000.0\" - This is a cash deposit of 3,000,000.00\n2. \"Initial20231231001 | Bank deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 5000000.0 | 5000000.0\" - This is a bank deposit of 5,000,000.00\n\nThe beginning balance is the sum of these two amounts:\n3,000,000.00 (cash) + 5,000,000.00 (bank) = 8,000,000.00\n\nThe fixed assets entry is not included in cash and cash equivalents as it represents non-liquid assets.\n\nTherefore, the beginning balance is 8,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
