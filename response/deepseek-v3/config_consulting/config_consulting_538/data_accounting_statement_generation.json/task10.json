In the given data, there are two depreciation entries:\n1. On 2024-01-01: 45,752.22\n2. On 2024-02-01: 45,750.84\n\nTotal Depreciation = 45,752.22 + 45,750.84 = 91,503.06\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Final Non-current Assets\nThe final value of non-current assets is the initial value minus the total depreciation.\n\nFinal Non-current Assets = Initial Non-current Assets - Total Depreciation\nFinal Non-current Assets = 5,000,000.00 - 91,503.06 = 4,908,496.94\n\n### Step 4: Prepare the Solution\nThe initial and final values of non-current assets are as follows:\n- Initial Value: 5,000,000.00\n- Final Value: 4,908,496.94\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '4908496.94'} }\n```",
