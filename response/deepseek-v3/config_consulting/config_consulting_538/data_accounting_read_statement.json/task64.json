                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we need.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific values from the financial statements:\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under \"Paid-in Capital\" or similar.\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is usually the \"Profit Before Tax\" line in the Income Statement.\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This would be the increase in \"Accounts Payable\" from the Balance Sheet or the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" from the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThe order to present these is:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet - Capital Contributed by Shareholders\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, there's a line item called \"Paid-in Capital\". This represents the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares.\n\n- **Initial_amount**: 13000000.00\n- **End_amount**: 13000000.00\n\nSince this is the capital contributed, the value we're interested in is the \"End_amount\" which is **13000000.00**.\n\n### 2. Income Statement - Profit Before Tax\nNow, let's look at the Income Statement. We're looking for \"Profit Before Tax\".\n\n- **Profit Before Tax**: 1114535.06\n\nThis is the profit or loss before tax expense, so our value here is **1114535.06**.\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement - Increase in Accounts Payable\nNext, we need the addition in the amount owed for goods or services purchased on credit. This is the increase in \"Accounts Payable\". \n\nLooking at the Cash Flow Statement, there's a line:\n- **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: 816000.00\n\nThis represents the increase in accounts payable during the period, so our value is **816000.00**.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nJust to make sure I'm doing this right, let's look at the example provided:\n\n- **value1 (Paid-in Capital)**: 13000000.00\n- **value2 (Profit Before Tax)**: -1373590.51\n- **value3 (Increase in Accounts Payable)**: 1590000.00\n\nThis matches the solution given, so my approach seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1114535.06', 'value3': '816000.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. **Balance Sheet**: Found \"Paid-in Capital\" with end amount of 13000000.00 → value1.\n2. **Income Statement**: Found \"Profit Before Tax\" of 1114535.06 → value2.\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**: Found \"Increase in Accounts Payable\" of 816000.00 → value3.\n\nAll values are correctly identified and ordered as per the instructions.",
