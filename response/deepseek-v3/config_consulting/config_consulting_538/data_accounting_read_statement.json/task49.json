I'm going to go through the cash flow statement provided and identify the three specific line items we're interested in:\n\n1. **The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This typically refers to \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" because accounts payable represent amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\n2. **Acquisition of property, plant and equipment**: This is usually listed as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the cash flow statement under investing activities.\n\n3. **Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period**: This is straightforward; it's the \"Beginning Balance\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section.\n\nNow, let's find these in the given problem:\n\n### 1. Increase in Accounts Payable\nLooking at the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, we see:\n- \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with an Amount of `816000.00`.\n\nThis is the first value we need (`value1`).\n\n### 2. Purchase of Fixed Assets\nUnder \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\", there's:\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an Amount of `0.00`.\n\nThis is the second value (`value2`).\n\n### 3. Cash and Cash Equivalents at Beginning\nIn the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section:\n- \"Beginning Balance\" is `8000000.00`.\n\nThis is the third value (`value3`).\n\nNow, let's put these into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '816000.00', 'value2': '0.00', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```\n\n### Verification:\n- `value1`: \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is indeed the amount owed for goods/services on credit, and it's `816000.00`.\n- `value2`: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment, and it's `0.00` (no purchases this period).\n- `value3`: \"Beginning Balance\" is the cash at the start, correctly `8000000.00`.\n\nEverything checks out! \n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '816000.00', 'value2': '0.00', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
