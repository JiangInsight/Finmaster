                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line item and value that represents the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit during the period. This is typically reflected in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section as \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task is to find the line item that shows the change in accounts receivable, which indicates the decrease (or increase) in amounts owed to the entity for credit sales.\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is present under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities.\"\n3. **Interpret the Value**: The value associated with this line item is \"-1716911.17.\" A negative value indicates an increase in accounts receivable (i.e., amounts owed to the entity have increased), while a positive value would indicate a decrease. However, the task specifically asks for the \"decrease\" in amounts owed. Since the value is negative, it means there was an increase, not a decrease. But the task might be asking for the absolute value or the line item itself. Given the example, the solution provided was the value of the line item regardless of its sign.\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value to extract is \"-1716911.17.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1716911.17'}}\n```",
