This is typically labeled as \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item \"Accounts Receivable\" represents the amounts owed to the entity by customers for goods or services sold on credit. This is the item we are interested in.\n\n2. **Locate the Initial and End Values**:\n   - In the given balance sheet, the \"Accounts Receivable\" line shows:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00 (as of the Initial_date: 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: 1716911.17 (as of the End_date: 2024-02-05)\n\n3. **Extract the Values**:\n   - The initial value is the amount at the start of the period (Initial_amount).\n   - The end value is the amount at the end of the period (End_amount).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1716911.17'} }\n```",
