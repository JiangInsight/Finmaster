I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe're given a cash flow statement, and we need to:\n\n1. **Identify the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities.** This is the principal revenue-producing activities of the entity, excluding investing and financing activities.\n   \n2. **Decompose this net amount into 7 component sub-items**, all of which must come from the input statement. Each sub-item should have its final value extracted.\n\nFrom the example provided, it seems that:\n\n- The \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" is the main value we're interested in.\n- The sub-items are the line items that contribute to this net cash flow from operating activities. In the example, these were:\n  - Net Profit\n  - Depreciation\n  - (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\n  - (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\n  - (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\n  - Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\n  - Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nLet's look at the provided cash flow statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit  | 963263.19 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation  | 91503.06 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -1716911.17 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -14869.76 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -174000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 816000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 151271.87 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | 116257.19 | 2024-02-05 |\n| ... (other sections not relevant to operating activities) ... |\n\nFrom this:\n\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: 116257.19\n- The sub-items contributing to this are the 7 items listed above it:\n  1. Net Profit: 963263.19\n  2. Depreciation: 91503.06\n  3. (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable: -1716911.17\n  4. (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable: -14869.76\n  5. (Increase) Decrease in Inventory: -174000.00\n  6. Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable: 816000.00\n  7. Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable: 151271.87\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nJust to ensure these sub-items sum up to the net cash flow:\n\nLet's add them up:\n\n1. 963263.19 (Net Profit)\n2. + 91503.06 (Depreciation) = 1054766.25\n3. + (-1716911.17) = -662144.92\n4. + (-14869.76) = -677014.68\n5. + (-174000.00) = -851014.68\n6. + 816000.00 = -35014.68\n7. + 151271.87 = 116257.19\n\nThis matches the \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" of 116257.19, so our identification of sub-items is correct.\n\n### Constructing the Solution\n\nNow, we'll format the answer as per the required JSON structure. The example showed the sub_items as a dictionary with keys 'sub_item value1' to 'sub_item value7'. \n\nSo, mapping:\n\n1. sub_item value1: Net Profit\n2. sub_item value2: Depreciation\n3. sub_item value3: (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\n4. sub_item value4: (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\n5. sub_item value5: (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\n6. sub_item value6: Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\n7. sub_item value7: Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '116257.19', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '963263.19', 'sub_item value2': '91503.06', 'sub_item value3': '-1716911.17', 'sub_item value4': '-14869.76', 'sub_item value5': '-174000.00', 'sub_item value6': '816000.00', 'sub_item value7': '151271.87'}}}\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the instruction, it seems the sub_items are supposed to be directly under 'solution' with keys like 'sub_items_sub_item value1', etc. So adjusting the format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '116257.19', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '963263.19', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '91503.06', 'sub_items_sub_item value3': '-1716911.17', 'sub_items_sub_item value4': '-14869.76', 'sub_items_sub_item value5': '-174000.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value6': '816000.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value7': '151271.87'} }\n```\n\nBut the example had sub_items as a nested dictionary. Given the instruction says to present in the following json format, and the example had nested sub_items, I think the first format is correct. Maybe the instruction has a typo in the format example.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll go with the nested dictionary approach as in the provided example.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '116257.19', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '963263.19', 'sub_item value2': '91503.06', 'sub_item value3': '-1716911.17', 'sub_item value4': '-14869.76', 'sub_item value5': '-174000.00', 'sub_item value6': '816000.00', 'sub_item value7': '151271.87'}}}\n```",
