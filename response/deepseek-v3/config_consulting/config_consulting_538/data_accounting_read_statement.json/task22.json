This line item is typically labeled as \"Gross Profit,\" which is calculated as Total Revenue minus Cost of Goods Sold (or Total Cost).\n\nFrom the given problem:\n- Total Revenue = 3025437.82\n- Total Cost = 1312000.00\n- Gross Profit = 1713437.82 (which is the difference between Total Revenue and Total Cost)\n\nThus, the value we are looking for is the Gross Profit amount.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify Total Revenue: 3025437.82\n2. Identify Total Cost: 1312000.00\n3. Calculate the difference (Gross Profit): 3025437.82 - 1312000.00 = 1713437.82\n4. Confirm that the Gross Profit in the table matches this calculation: 1713437.82 (which it does)\n\nThe solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1713437.82'}}\n```",
