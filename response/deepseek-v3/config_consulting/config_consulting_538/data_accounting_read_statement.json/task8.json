These amounts are typically listed under \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item that represents amounts owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit is \"Accounts Payable\". This is a liability account that records the company's obligation to pay off short-term debts to its creditors or suppliers.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value and Date**:\n   - From the given balance sheet, the \"Accounts Payable\" line shows:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00\n     - Initial_date: 2023-12-31\n\n3. **Extract End Value and Date**:\n   - The \"Accounts Payable\" line also shows:\n     - End_amount: 816000.00\n     - End_date: 2024-02-05\n\n4. **Verify the Context**:\n   - The example provided in the task description also uses \"Accounts Payable\" as the line item for amounts owed for goods or services on credit. This confirms our approach.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '816000.00'} }\n```",
