This is typically labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" in the cash flow statement under the operating activities section.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, we can see the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an amount of \"151271.87\" dated \"2024-02-05\".\n3. **Verify the Context**: This line item is under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, which is the correct section for such adjustments related to accrued taxes.\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with this line item is \"151271.87\", which represents the increase in tax payable (i.e., tax accrued but not yet paid).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '151271.87'} }\n```",
