These items are typically categorized under \"Fixed Assets\" in the balance sheet. \n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Fixed Assets\" represents tangible items used in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes. This is the primary item we are interested in.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Fixed Assets\" is provided as \"5000000.00\" with the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Fixed Assets\" is provided as \"5000000.00\" with the end date \"2024-02-05\". \n\n4. **Verify Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item shows the depreciation charged on fixed assets. The initial value is \"0.00\", and the end value is \"91503.06\". \n   - However, the \"Fixed Assets\" line item does not seem to be adjusted for depreciation in the end value (it remains \"5000000.00\"), while the \"Total Non-current Assets\" (which includes fixed assets net of depreciation) is adjusted to \"4908496.94\". This suggests that the \"Fixed Assets\" line item is the gross value, and the net value is reflected in \"Total Non-current Assets\".\n   - For the purpose of this task, we are likely interested in the gross value of fixed assets (i.e., \"Fixed Assets\" before depreciation), as the task asks for the value of tangible items held for use, not their net book value.\n\n5. **Final Values**:\n   - Initial value of fixed assets: \"5000000.00\".\n   - End value of fixed assets: \"5000000.00\".\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5000000.00'}}\n```",
