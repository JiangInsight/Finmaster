This line item is typically labeled as \"Depreciation\" in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task is to find the depreciation value in the cash flow statement. Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.\n\n2. **Locate the Depreciation Line Item**: In the given cash flow statement, we look for the line item labeled \"Depreciation\" under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with the \"Depreciation\" line item is the amount we need to extract.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: Ensure that the line item is indeed under the operating activities section, as depreciation is typically a non-cash expense added back to net profit in this section.\n\n5. **Check the Example**: The example provided confirms that the \"Depreciation\" line item is the correct one to extract, and the value is directly taken from the \"Amount\" column.\n\n### Application to the Given Problem:\n\n- In the provided cash flow statement, the \"Depreciation\" line item is present under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" with an amount of \"91503.06\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91503.06'}}\n```",
