COGS reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, including the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the goods.\n   \n2. **Identifying the Line Item**: In the given income statement, the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is explicitly listed with an amount of \"1312000.00\" for the date \"2024-02-05.\"\n\n3. **Verifying the Line Item**: There are no other line items that could represent the carrying amount of inventories sold (e.g., \"Inventory Expense\" or similar). The \"Total Cost\" is also listed as \"1312000.00,\" which matches the COGS, further confirming that COGS is the correct line item to extract.\n\n4. **Extracting the Value**: The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is \"1312000.00.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1312000.00'}}\n```",
