In the given problem, this is \"Main Business Revenue\" with the value \"3025437.82\".\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is typically the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) line item, as it represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the entity. In the given problem, this is \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with the value \"1312000.00\".\n\nThe order of the values in the solution should match the order of the line items as they appear in the income statement. \n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify \"Main Business Revenue\" as the first line item representing core operating income. Its value is \"3025437.82\".\n2. Identify \"Cost of Goods Sold\" as the second line item representing the carrying amount of inventories sold. Its value is \"1312000.00\".\n3. Ensure the order of the values in the solution matches the order in the income statement: \"Main Business Revenue\" first, followed by \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n\nThe final solution is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3025437.82', 'value2': '1312000.00'} }\n```",
