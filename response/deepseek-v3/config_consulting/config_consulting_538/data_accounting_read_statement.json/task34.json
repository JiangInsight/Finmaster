                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through the income statement provided and identify the three specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific items from the income statement:\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**: This typically refers to the total revenue generated from the main operations of the business.\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is usually represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS), which is the direct cost attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company.\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**: These are the administrative expenses incurred in running the business as a whole.\n\n### Analyzing the Income Statement\nLet's look at the provided income statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 3025437.82 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Revenue | 3025437.82 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 1312000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Cost | 1312000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Gross Profit | 1713437.82 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 126790.73 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Selling Expenses | 345311.74 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation | 91503.06 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Financial Expenses | 50166.99 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Expenses | 613772.52 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Interest Income | 14869.76 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 1114535.06 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Tax Expense | 151271.87 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit | 963263.19 | 2024-02-05 |\n\n### Identifying the Required Line Items\n\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**:\n   - This is the total revenue from the main business operations. In the statement, we see \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\" both with the same amount. Typically, \"Total Revenue\" is the comprehensive figure that includes all revenue streams, but since both are the same here, either could represent the total income. Given that \"Total Revenue\" is a more encompassing term, it's likely the one to use.\n   - **Value**: 3025437.82\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period (Cost of Goods Sold)**:\n   - This is directly listed as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the statement.\n   - **Value**: 1312000.00\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**:\n   - These are the administrative expenses. In the statement, \"Administrative Expenses\" is clearly listed.\n   - **Value**: 126790.73\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nLooking back at the provided example:\n- 'value1' was \"Total Revenue\"\n- 'value2' was \"Cost of Goods Sold\"\n- 'value3' was \"Administrative Expenses\"\n\nThis aligns with our selections above.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the above reasoning, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3025437.82', 'value2': '1312000.00', 'value3': '126790.73'} }\n```",
