                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break down the task to understand what each of the four values we need to extract represents, and then locate them in the given cash flow statement.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task asks us to identify and extract four specific line items from the cash flow statement:\n\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is commonly known as **Depreciation**. It's the method by which a company allocates the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life.\n\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period**: This refers to changes in **Inventory**. An increase in inventory would mean cash is being used to buy more inventory (negative cash flow), and a decrease would mean inventory is being sold (positive cash flow).\n\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends**: This is the **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**. It includes purchases and sales of fixed assets, investments, etc.\n\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is the **Net Increase** in cash and cash equivalents, which shows the overall change in cash position during the period.\n\n### Locating the Values in the Given Statement\n\nNow, let's go through the provided cash flow statement to find these four items.\n\n1. **Depreciation**:\n   - Looking at the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, we see a line item \"Depreciation\" with an amount of \"91503.06\".\n\n2. **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**:\n   - In the same section, there's a line \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with the amount \"-174000.00\". \n   - The negative sign indicates an increase in inventory (since it's an outflow), but the task asks for the \"reduction\" in inventory, which would be the opposite. However, the line item is labeled as \"(Increase) Decrease\", so a negative value means an increase, and a positive would mean a decrease. Since we're asked for the \"reduction\", which would be a decrease, but the value is negative (increase), but the line item's name already accounts for the sign. So, the raw value is \"-174000.00\".\n\n   - Wait, looking back at the example, for \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\", the value was \"-5090000.00\", and in the solution, 'value2' was \"-5090000.00\". So, it seems we take the value as is from the line item, regardless of the sign interpretation. So, 'value2' is \"-174000.00\".\n\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - Under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\", there's \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with the amount \"-0.00\". \n   - Even though it's \"-0.00\", which is essentially zero, we'll take the exact value from the statement.\n\n4. **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n   - In the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, there's \"Net Increase\" with the amount \"116257.19\".\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example to ensure we're matching correctly:\n\n- 'value1': '45751.41' → Depreciation\n- 'value2': '-5090000.00' → (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\n- 'value3': '-305354.43' → Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n- 'value4': '-7565348.53' → Net Increase\n\nThis matches our understanding, so our approach seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling the values from the problem to solve:\n\n1. Depreciation: '91503.06'\n2. (Increase) Decrease in Inventory: '-174000.00'\n3. Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: '-0.00'\n4. Net Increase: '116257.19'\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91503.06', 'value2': '-174000.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '116257.19'} }\n```",
