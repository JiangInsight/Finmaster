The \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section typically includes the beginning balance, ending balance, and the net increase or decrease.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, the line item \"Beginning Balance\" represents the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: From the provided table, the \"Beginning Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" is listed as \"8000000.00\" on the date \"2024-02-05\".\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The \"Beginning Balance\" is indeed the starting amount of cash and cash equivalents before any changes during the period, which matches the requirement of the task.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
