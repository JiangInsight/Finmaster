These assets are typically categorized under \"Inventory\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: \n   - The balance sheet includes an \"Inventory\" line item, which represents goods held for sale in the ordinary course of business, goods in production for such sale, or goods in the process of being manufactured. This is the relevant line item for the task.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - From the \"Inventory\" row in the balance sheet:\n     - **Initial_amount**: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - **End_amount**: 174000.00 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n3. **Verify**:\n   - The initial value of Inventory is 0.00, indicating no inventory was recorded at the start of the period.\n   - The end value of Inventory is 174000.00, indicating the value of inventory at the end of the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '174000.00'} }\n```",
