This information is typically found under \"Retained Earnings\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - In the balance sheet provided, the line item \"Retained Earnings\" represents the cumulative profits or losses retained in the entity and not distributed to shareholders.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Retained Earnings\" is given as `0.00` on the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Retained Earnings\" is given as `963263.19` on the end date `2024-02-05`.\n\n4. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The initial value is `0.00`, indicating no retained earnings at the start of the period.\n   - The end value is `963263.19`, indicating a positive retained earnings (profit) at the end of the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '963263.19'} }\n```",
