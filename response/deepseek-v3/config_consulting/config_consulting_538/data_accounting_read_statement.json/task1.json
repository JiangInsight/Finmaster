The relevant line items are typically \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" as they represent liquid assets readily available for operational use.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Cash-Related Line Items**: \n   - \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" are the primary accounts that represent cash available for day-to-day operations.\n   - Other items like \"Interest Receivable,\" \"Accounts Receivable,\" and \"Inventory\" are not considered cash for operational purposes.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - For \"Cash on Hand\":\n     - Initial value: 3000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End value: 3537257.19 (as of 2024-02-05)\n   - For \"Bank Deposits\":\n     - Initial value: 5000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End value: 4579000.00 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n3. **Sum the Values**:\n   - Initial total cash = Cash on Hand (initial) + Bank Deposits (initial) = 3000000.00 + 5000000.00 = 8000000.00\n   - End total cash = Cash on Hand (end) + Bank Deposits (end) = 3537257.19 + 4579000.00 = 8116257.19\n\n4. **Present the Solution**:\n   - The initial and end values of cash available for day-to-day operations are the sums calculated above.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '8116257.19'} }\n```",
