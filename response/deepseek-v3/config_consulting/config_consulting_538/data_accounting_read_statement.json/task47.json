I'm going to break it down to understand how to find the net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period, and then decompose it into two component sub-items.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's look at what the task is asking:\n\n1. **Identify the net addition in cash and cash equivalents**: This is the change in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n2. **Decompose this item into two sub-items**: These sub-items should be parts that, when combined, give the net addition. Both must come from the cash flow statement.\n3. **Output the values**: The final value of the net addition and the two sub-items.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Cash Flow Statement\n\nLet's look at the provided cash flow statement. The relevant section is under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\":\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Beginning Balance | 8,000,000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Ending Balance | 8,116,257.19 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Increase | 116,257.19 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nFrom this, we can see:\n\n- **Beginning Balance**: The amount of cash at the start of the period.\n- **Ending Balance**: The amount of cash at the end of the period.\n- **Net Increase**: The change in cash during the period (Ending Balance - Beginning Balance).\n\n### Identifying the Net Addition\n\nThe \"Net Increase\" is the net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period. Here, it's **116,257.19**.\n\n### Decomposing the Net Addition\n\nNow, we need to find two sub-items that sum up to the net addition. These should be parts that are used to calculate the net increase in cash.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement, the net increase in cash is typically calculated as:\n\nNet Increase = Ending Balance - Beginning Balance\n\nBut we need two sub-items that are part of the cash flow statement and whose difference gives the net increase. \n\nLooking at the structure, the two sub-items are:\n\n1. **Ending Balance**: The final amount of cash.\n2. **Beginning Balance**: The initial amount of cash.\n\nTheir difference gives the net increase:\n\nNet Increase = Ending Balance - Beginning Balance\n116,257.19 = 8,116,257.19 - 8,000,000.00\n\nSo, the two sub-items are the ending and beginning balances.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example:\n\n- Net Increase: -7,565,348.53\n- Sub-items: \n  - sub_item value1: 8,000,000.00 (Beginning Balance)\n  - sub_item value2: 434,651.47 (Ending Balance)\n\nIndeed, 434,651.47 - 8,000,000.00 = -7,565,348.53, which matches the net increase.\n\nThis confirms that the two sub-items are the beginning and ending balances.\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nFor our problem:\n\n- **value (Net Increase)**: 116,257.19\n- **sub_item value1 (Beginning Balance)**: 8,000,000.00\n- **sub_item value2 (Ending Balance)**: 8,116,257.19\n\n### Formatting the Answer\n\nThe answer should be in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '116257.19', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_item value2': '8116257.19'}}}\n```\n\n### Checking for Alternative Sub-items\n\nJust to ensure that there aren't other possible sub-items, let's see if the net increase can be broken down differently using other parts of the cash flow statement.\n\nThe net cash flow is also the sum of:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n- Net Cash Flow from Financing Activities (though this isn't present here)\n\nIn our case:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: 116,257.19\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -0.00\n\nTotal: 116,257.19 + (-0.00) = 116,257.19\n\nThis also sums to the net increase. So, another possible decomposition could be:\n\n- sub_item value1: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities (116,257.19)\n- sub_item value2: Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities (-0.00)\n\nBut the example used beginning and ending balances, and the instruction says both sub-items must originate from the input statement. Both decompositions are valid, but the first one aligns with the example.\n\nGiven that the example used beginning and ending balances, it's safer to follow that approach unless specified otherwise.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter careful consideration, the most straightforward decomposition following the example is using the beginning and ending balances.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '116257.19', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_item value2': '8116257.19'}}}\n```",
