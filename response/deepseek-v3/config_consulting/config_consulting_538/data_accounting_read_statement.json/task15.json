Here's how we can extract the required information:\n\n1. **Initial Value**: The initial value of the total equity is found under the \"Initial_amount\" column for the \"Total Owner's Equity\" line item. In this case, it is '13000000.00' as of the initial date '2023-12-31'.\n\n2. **End Value**: The end value of the total equity is found under the \"End_amount\" column for the \"Total Owner's Equity\" line item. In this case, it is '13963263.19' as of the end date '2024-02-05'.\n\nThus, the solution is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13963263.19'} }\n```",
