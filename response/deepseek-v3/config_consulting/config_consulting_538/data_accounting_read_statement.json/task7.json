The key expense item in a balance sheet is typically \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" which represents the total depreciation expense accumulated over time on fixed assets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Identify Expense Line Items**: \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is the primary expense-related item. This account shows the total depreciation expense that has been charged against fixed assets up to the given date.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Amount**: The initial value of \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is `0.00` as of the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n   - **End Amount**: The end value of \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is `91503.06` as of the end date `2024-02-05`.\n\n3. **Verify Context**:\n   - The example provided in the task also used \"Accumulated Depreciation\" as the expense line item, confirming that this is the correct item to extract.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '91503.06'} }\n```",
