Looking at transaction ID \"Sale20240120051\":\n   - The invoice description states: \"1.0 units at a unit price of $7925.8, totaling $10955.90\"\n   - But 1 * 7925.8 = 7925.8, which doesn't match the recorded amount of 10955.9\n   - The description also mentions \"cost amount was $5000.00, with a tax amount of $478.08, leading to total amount due of $9083.51\"\n   - This suggests the correct unit price should be $9561.59 (since 9561.59 * 1 = 9561.59, and 9561.59 - 478.08 = 9083.51)\n\n2. The risk_issues field also confirms this discrepancy with:\n   - {'Original amount': 9561.59, 'Recorded amount': 10955.9}\n   - {'Original price': 9561.59, 'Recorded price': 7925.8}\n\n3. Other fields like category, date, payment status, etc. appear consistent between the invoice description and recorded values.\n\nHere's the solution in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Original date\": \"2024-01-20\",\n    \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-20\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\",\n    \"Original payment_method\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": \"\",\n    \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"1.0\",\n    \"Original price\": \"9561.59\",\n    \"Recorded price\": \"7925.8\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n    \"Original amount\": \"9561.59\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"10955.9\",\n    \"Original tax\": \"478.08\",\n    \"Recorded tax\": \"478.08\",\n    \"Original profit\": \"4561.59\",\n    \"Recorded profit\": \"4561.59\",\n    \"Original Preparer\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": \"\",\n    \"Original Approver\": \"\",\n    \"Recorded Approver\": \"\",\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240120051\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe main inconsistencies are:\n1. The unit price is incorrectly recorded as 7925.8 when it should be 9561.59\n2. The total amount is incorrectly recorded as 10955.9 when it should be 9561.59\n3. The tax amount (478.08) and profit (4561.59) calculations are correct based on the correct unit price of 9561.59",
