                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Asset Ratio, the Gross Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. \n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end of period):\n\n- **Total Liabilities:** This is the \"Total Current Liabilities\" because there are no non-current liabilities listed.\n  - Total Current Liabilities = 631,880.98\n\n- **Total Assets:** 14,799,664.61\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{631,880.98}{14,799,664.61} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n631,880.98 ÷ 14,799,664.61 ≈ 0.0427\n\nTo express this as a ratio to two decimal places: 0.04\n\nBut looking at the example, it seems they might have used more decimal places or rounded differently. Let me check the calculation more precisely:\n\n631880.98 / 14799664.61 ≈ 0.042696\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.04\n\nBut in the example, they had 0.14, which seems higher. Maybe I missed something. Wait, is \"Total Liabilities\" just current liabilities? Or are there other liabilities?\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, under liabilities, there's only \"Total Current Liabilities\" and no other liabilities like long-term debt. So it seems correct to use just current liabilities.\n\nBut in the example, they had:\n\nTotal Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\nTotal Assets: 13,216,409.49\nRatio: 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.1409 or 0.14\n\nSo my calculation seems correct based on the given data. Maybe the example had more liabilities.\n\nSo for our case, it's 0.04.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any other liabilities. The balance sheet shows:\n\nAccounts Payable: 462,000.00\nTaxes Payable: 169,880.98\nTotal Current Liabilities: 631,880.98\n\nNo other liabilities are listed. So it's correct.\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n\n- Gross Profit: 2,060,619.40\n- Total Revenue: 3,397,619.40\n\nCalculate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,060,619.40}{3,397,619.40} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide:\n\n2,060,619.40 ÷ 3,397,619.40 ≈ 0.6065\n\nThen multiply by 100:\n\n0.6065 × 100 ≈ 60.65%\n\nSo, 60.65%.\n\nLooking at the example:\n\nGross Profit: 1,021,018.59\nTotal Revenue: 5,431,018.59\nMargin: (1,021,018.59 / 5,431,018.59) × 100 ≈ 18.80%\n\nSo our calculation seems correct.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operating activities. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -1,368,775.90\n- Total Current Liabilities: 631,880.98 (from balance sheet)\n\nCalculate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-1,368,775.90}{631,880.98} \\]\n\nDivide:\n\n-1,368,775.90 ÷ 631,880.98 ≈ -2.166\n\nSo, -2.17 (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nIn the example:\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,259,994.10\nTotal Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\nRatio: -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.90\n\nSo our calculation method is correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all three ratios:\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.04\n- Gross Profit Margin: 60.65%\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -2.17\n\nExpressed in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04', 'Gross Profit Margin': '60.65%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.17'}}\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the ratios were presented with two decimal places for Debt to Asset and Operating Cash Flow, and two decimal places for Gross Profit Margin. So I'll adjust the Gross Profit Margin to two decimal places:\n\n60.65% is already two decimal places (60.65), so it's fine.\n\nSimilarly, 0.04 is two decimal places, and -2.17 is two decimal places.\n\nSo the final answer is correct as is.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04', 'Gross Profit Margin': '60.65%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.17'}}\n```",
