                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio one by one to understand how to compute them based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- **Total Liabilities:** This is the sum of all liabilities. In the given balance sheet, under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" we see:\n  - Accounts Payable: 462,000.00\n  - Taxes Payable: 169,880.98\n  - Total Current Liabilities: 631,880.98\n\n  There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 631,880.98.\n\n- **Total Assets:** From the balance sheet, \"Total Assets\" at the end date is 14,799,664.61.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{631,880.98}{14,799,664.61} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n631,880.98 ÷ 14,799,664.61 ≈ 0.0427\n\nTo express this as a ratio to two decimal places: 0.04\n\nWait a minute, in the example provided, the Debt to Asset Ratio was 0.14, which seems higher. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLooking back at the balance sheet, is there any other liability? It seems only current liabilities are present, and no long-term debt or other liabilities are listed. So, unless there's missing information, the calculation seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the example to see how they got 0.14.\n\nIn the example:\n- Total Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\n- Total Assets: 13,216,409.49\n- Ratio: 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.1408 or 0.14\n\nOkay, so in our case, it's indeed just the current liabilities, totaling 631,880.98, divided by total assets of 14,799,664.61, which gives approximately 0.0427 or 0.04 when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nPerhaps the company in this problem has very little debt compared to assets.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operating activities to the net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -1,368,775.90\n- **Net Income:** From the income statement, \"Net Profit\" is 1,167,783.63.\n\nWait, the net income is positive, but the operating cash flow is negative. That seems unusual because typically, positive net income would correspond to positive operating cash flow, but adjustments like changes in working capital can lead to differences.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-1,368,775.90}{1,167,783.63} \\]\n\nThis division gives:\n\n-1,368,775.90 ÷ 1,167,783.63 ≈ -1.172\n\nExpressed to two decimal places: -1.17\n\nBut in the example, the ratio was positive (4.41), even though both net income and operating cash flow were negative. \n\nIn the example:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,259,994.10\n- Net Profit: -1,645,141.43\n- Ratio: -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41\n\nSo, negative divided by negative is positive. In our case, negative divided by positive is negative.\n\nThis suggests that the company's operating cash flow is negative despite having positive net income, which could indicate that while the company is profitable on paper, it's not generating cash from operations, possibly due to significant increases in working capital (like higher accounts receivable or inventory).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nAfter carefully calculating both ratios:\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio:** 0.04\n2. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:** -1.17\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-1.17'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me quickly verify the calculations to ensure no mistakes.\n\n1. Debt to Asset Ratio:\n   - Total Liabilities: 631,880.98\n   - Total Assets: 14,799,664.61\n   - 631,880.98 / 14,799,664.61 ≈ 0.0427 → 0.04 (correct)\n\n2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income:\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -1,368,775.90\n   - Net Income: 1,167,783.63\n   - -1,368,775.90 / 1,167,783.63 ≈ -1.172 → -1.17 (correct)\n\nEverything checks out. The negative operating cash flow to net income ratio indicates that the company's cash flow from operations is negative despite reporting a positive net income, which could be a red flag requiring further investigation into why cash isn't being generated from profits (possibly due to heavy investment in working capital). The low debt to asset ratio suggests the company is not heavily leveraged, with most assets financed by equity.",
