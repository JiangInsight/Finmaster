                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Net Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Net Profit Margin is. From what I recall, the Net Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows what percentage of a company's revenue is actual profit after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted. \n\nThe formula for Net Profit Margin is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nThis will give us a percentage that represents how much of each dollar earned by the company is profit.\n\n### Identifying the Given Values\n\nLooking at the provided income statement:\n\n- **Total Revenue**: 3,397,619.40\n- **Net Profit**: 1,167,783.63\n\nThese are the two key numbers we need for our calculation.\n\n### Calculating Net Profit Margin\n\nNow, let's plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,167,783.63}{3,397,619.40} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide Net Profit by Total Revenue:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,167,783.63}{3,397,619.40} \\approx 0.3437 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.3437 \\times 100 \\approx 34.37\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nLet me double-check the division to ensure accuracy:\n\n\\[ 1,167,783.63 \\div 3,397,619.40 \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n- 3,397,619.40 goes into 1,167,783.63 about 0.3437 times.\n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\n### Final Answer\n\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is approximately 34.37%.\n\n### Formatting the Answer\n\nThe solution should be presented in JSON format as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '34.37%'} }\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully going through the income statement and applying the Net Profit Margin formula, we've determined that the Net Profit Margin for this scenario is **34.37%**. This means that for every dollar of revenue the company earns, it retains about 34.37 cents as profit after all expenses and taxes.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '34.37%'} }\n```",
