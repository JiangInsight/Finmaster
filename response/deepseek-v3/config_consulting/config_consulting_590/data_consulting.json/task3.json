There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so the total liabilities are 631,880.98.\n\n2. **Identify Total Assets**: The \"Total Assets\" at the end of the reporting period is given as 14,799,664.61.\n\n3. **Calculate the Ratio**: The Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated by dividing Total Liabilities by Total Assets.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{631,880.98}{14,799,664.61}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} \\approx 0.0427\n   \\]\n   Rounding to two decimal places, the ratio is 0.04.\n\n4. **Present the Solution**: The final answer is presented in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04'} }\n```",
