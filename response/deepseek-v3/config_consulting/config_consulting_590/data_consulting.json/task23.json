                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio based on the provided financial statements. \n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This is a profitability ratio that shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: This is a solvency ratio that measures a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   Here, \"Total Debt\" can be considered as the \"Total Current Liabilities\" if there are no long-term liabilities mentioned. \n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the **Income Statement**:\n- Total Revenue: 3,397,619.40\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 1,337,000.00\n- Gross Profit: 2,060,619.40\n\nFrom the **Cash Flow Statement**:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -1,368,775.90\n\nFrom the **Balance Sheet**:\n- Total Current Liabilities: 631,880.98 (This will be our \"Total Debt\" since no long-term liabilities are provided.)\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,060,619.40}{3,397,619.40} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\\[\n\\frac{2,060,619.40}{3,397,619.40} \\approx 0.6065\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\\[\n0.6065 \\times 100 \\approx 60.65\\%\n\\]\n\n### Calculating Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-1,368,775.90}{631,880.98}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{-1,368,775.90}{631,880.98} \\approx -2.166\n\\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit: 2,060,619.40\n   - Total Revenue: 3,397,619.40\n   - 2,060,619.40 / 3,397,619.40 ≈ 0.6065 → 60.65%\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -1,368,775.90\n   - Total Current Liabilities: 631,880.98\n   - -1,368,775.90 / 631,880.98 ≈ -2.166\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '60.65%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.17'}}\n```\n\n*Note*: The Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is negative, indicating that the company's operating cash flow is negative relative to its debt, which could be a concern regarding its ability to cover debt obligations from operations. The Gross Profit Margin is quite healthy at over 60%, showing good profitability at the gross level.",
