                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand each component before arriving at the final numbers.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all Main Business Revenue is credit sales) = 3,397,619.40\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable = 0.00 (from initial date)\n- Ending Accounts Receivable = 2,902,136.39\n\n**Average Accounts Receivable:**\n\\[ \\text{Average AR} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning AR} + \\text{Ending AR}}{2} = \\frac{0 + 2,902,136.39}{2} = 1,451,068.195 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{AR Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{3,397,619.40}{1,451,068.195} \\approx 2.34 \\]\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio was calculated differently. The example had:\n\n- Main Business Revenue: 5,431,018.59\n- Average AR: (0 + 2,429,482.13)/2 = 1,214,741.065\n- Ratio: 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 ≈ 4.47\n\nSo, following the same approach, my calculation seems correct.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,368,775.90\n- Current Liabilities = 631,880.98\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-1,368,775.90}{631,880.98} \\approx -2.17 \\]\n\nIn the example:\n- Operating Cash Flow = -7,259,994.10\n- Current Liabilities = 1,861,550.92\n- Ratio: -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.90\n\nSo, seems correct.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis seems identical to the Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the example (both were -3.90 in the example). Maybe it's the same thing with a different name. So:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} = -2.17 \\]\n\nBut in the example, both were -3.90, so perhaps they are indeed the same. I'll keep it as -2.17 for both unless there's a distinction.\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Sales}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Sales (Total Revenue) = 3,397,619.40\n- Beginning Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets = 14,799,664.61\n\n**Average Total Assets:**\n\\[ \\text{Average TA} = \\frac{13,000,000.00 + 14,799,664.61}{2} = \\frac{27,799,664.61}{2} = 13,899,832.305 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{3,397,619.40}{13,899,832.305} \\approx 0.244 \\]\n\nIn the example:\n- Net Sales: 5,431,018.59\n- Average TA: (13,000,000 + 13,216,409.49)/2 = 13,108,204.745\n- Ratio: 5,431,018.59 / 13,108,204.745 ≈ 0.41\n\nHmm, my calculation seems lower. Maybe I missed something. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nWait, the initial amount is for 2023-12-31, and end is for 2024-02-05. The income statement is for 2024-02-05, so the period is from 2023-12-31 to 2024-02-05, roughly one month and a bit. The example was for one month (2024-01-30), so similar.\n\nBut my ratio is lower because sales are lower relative to assets. Maybe it's correct.\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 631,880.98\n- Total Shareholders' Equity = 14,167,783.63\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{631,880.98}{14,167,783.63} \\approx 0.0446 \\]\n\nIn the example:\n- Total Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\n- Equity: 11,354,858.57\n- Ratio: 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.16\n\nMine is much lower because liabilities are much smaller relative to equity.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the example:\n\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover: 4.47 (sales / avg AR)\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -3.90 (operating cash flow / current liabilities)\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: same as above\n- Total Asset Turnover: 0.41 (sales / avg assets)\n- Debt to Equity: 0.16 (total liabilities / equity)\n\nMy calculations follow the same method, just with different numbers leading to different ratios.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating each ratio:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.34', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-2.17', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.17', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.24', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.04'} }\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the operating cash flow ratio and operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio were the same, so I'll keep both as -2.17. \n\nThe other ratios seem correctly calculated based on the provided data and formulas. \n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.34', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-2.17', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.17', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.24', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.04'} }\n```",
