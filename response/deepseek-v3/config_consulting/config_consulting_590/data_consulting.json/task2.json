                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Quick Ratio based on the given balance sheet data. \n\n### Understanding the Quick Ratio\nFirst, I recall that the Quick Ratio (also known as the Acid-Test Ratio) is a measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. The formula for the Quick Ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**Quick Assets** typically include:\n1. Cash and cash equivalents (like Cash on Hand and Bank Deposits)\n2. Marketable securities (if any, but not present here)\n3. Accounts Receivable\n4. Other receivables (like Interest Receivable in this case)\n\n**Not included in Quick Assets**:\n- Inventory (because it's not as liquid)\n- Prepaid expenses (not present here)\n\n**Current Liabilities** are the obligations the company needs to pay within a year, which in this case are:\n- Accounts Payable\n- Taxes Payable\n- And any other short-term liabilities listed (none others here)\n\n### Identifying the Relevant Data from the Problem\nLooking at the provided balance sheet as of the end date (2024-02-05), here are the relevant amounts:\n\n**Quick Assets:**\n1. Cash on Hand: 2,339,224.10\n2. Bank Deposits: 4,292,000.00\n3. Interest Receivable: 14,796.43\n4. Accounts Receivable: 2,902,136.39\n\n**Inventory:** 343,000.00 (This is NOT part of quick assets)\n\n**Current Liabilities:**\n1. Accounts Payable: 462,000.00\n2. Taxes Payable: 169,880.98\n3. Total Current Liabilities: 631,880.98 (This matches the sum of the two above)\n\n### Calculating Quick Assets\nNow, let's sum up the quick assets:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = \\text{Cash on Hand} + \\text{Bank Deposits} + \\text{Interest Receivable} + \\text{Accounts Receivable} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = 2,339,224.10 + 4,292,000.00 + 14,796.43 + 2,902,136.39 \\]\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n1. Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits:\n   \\[ 2,339,224.10 + 4,292,000.00 = 6,631,224.10 \\]\n2. Add Interest Receivable:\n   \\[ 6,631,224.10 + 14,796.43 = 6,646,020.53 \\]\n3. Add Accounts Receivable:\n   \\[ 6,646,020.53 + 2,902,136.39 = 9,548,156.92 \\]\n\nSo, Quick Assets = 9,548,156.92\n\n### Current Liabilities\nThe total current liabilities are already given as 631,880.98, which is the sum of Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable.\n\n### Calculating the Quick Ratio\nNow, plug these into the Quick Ratio formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{9,548,156.92}{631,880.98} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\nFirst, simplify the denominator and numerator to make division easier:\n\n\\[ \\frac{9,548,156.92}{631,880.98} \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ 631,880.98 \\times 15 = 9,478,214.70 \\]\n\\[ 9,548,156.92 - 9,478,214.70 = 69,942.22 \\]\nSo, 15 + (69,942.22 / 631,880.98)\n\nNow, 631,880.98 × 0.11 ≈ 69,506.91\nRemaining: 69,942.22 - 69,506.91 ≈ 435.31\n\nSo, approximately 15.11\n\nBut let's calculate it more precisely using a calculator:\n\n\\[ 9,548,156.92 ÷ 631,880.98 ≈ 15.11 \\]\n\nSo, the Quick Ratio is approximately 15.11.\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nWait a minute, this seems quite high. Let me double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't make a mistake in identifying quick assets or current liabilities.\n\nQuick Assets:\n- Cash on Hand: 2,339,224.10\n- Bank Deposits: 4,292,000.00\n- Interest Receivable: 14,796.43\n- Accounts Receivable: 2,902,136.39\nTotal: 2,339,224.10 + 4,292,000.00 = 6,631,224.10\n+ 14,796.43 = 6,646,020.53\n+ 2,902,136.39 = 9,548,156.92\n\nCurrent Liabilities:\n- Accounts Payable: 462,000.00\n- Taxes Payable: 169,880.98\nTotal: 631,880.98\n\nDivision:\n9,548,156.92 / 631,880.98 ≈ 15.11\n\nYes, the calculation seems correct. The Quick Ratio is indeed high, indicating that the company has significantly more liquid assets than current liabilities, which is a good sign for liquidity.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter carefully calculating, the Quick Ratio is approximately 15.11.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '15.11'} }\n```",
