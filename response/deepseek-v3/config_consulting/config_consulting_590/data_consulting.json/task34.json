                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one using the provided financial statements. I'll go through each ratio, explain what it is, and then calculate it step by step.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,368,775.90\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 631,880.98\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{-1,368,775.90}{631,880.98} \\approx -2.17 \\]\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio indicates the proportion of equity and debt a company is using to finance its assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 631,880.98 (since there are no non-current liabilities listed)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,167,783.63\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{631,880.98}{14,167,783.63} \\approx 0.0446 \\]\nRounded to two decimal places: 0.04\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the Debt to Equity Ratio was calculated using Total Current Liabilities as the numerator, even though the definition usually considers all liabilities. Here, since there are no long-term liabilities, it's just current liabilities. So, it's correct as is.\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\nSince we only have ending total assets (no beginning for the period), we'll use the ending total assets as an approximation.\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 3,397,619.40\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets (End) = 14,799,664.61\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{3,397,619.40}{14,799,664.61} \\approx 0.23 \\]\n\n*But in the example, they seemed to use only the initial total assets or an average wasn't calculated. Here, since we have initial and end, ideally we'd average them, but initial is 13,000,000 and end is 14,799,664.61.*\n\nAverage Total Assets:\n\\[ \\frac{13,000,000 + 14,799,664.61}{2} = \\frac{27,799,664.61}{2} \\approx 13,899,832.305 \\]\n\nRecalculating:\n\\[ \\frac{3,397,619.40}{13,899,832.305} \\approx 0.244 \\]\nRounded to two decimal places: 0.24\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 2,339,224.10\n- Bank Deposits = 4,292,000.00\n- Interest Receivable = 14,796.43\n- Accounts Receivable = 2,902,136.39\n- Total Quick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n  = 2,339,224.10 + 4,292,000.00 + 14,796.43 + 2,902,136.39\n  = 9,548,156.92\n- Current Liabilities = 631,880.98\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{9,548,156.92}{631,880.98} \\approx 15.11 \\]\n\n*This seems unusually high. Maybe we shouldn't include Interest Receivable in quick assets? Typically, quick assets are cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Let's exclude Interest Receivable.*\n\nRecalculating Quick Assets:\n= Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable\n= 2,339,224.10 + 4,292,000.00 + 2,902,136.39\n= 9,533,360.49\n\nQuick Ratio:\n\\[ \\frac{9,533,360.49}{631,880.98} \\approx 15.09 \\]\nStill very high. Maybe the bank deposits are not considered marketable securities? But usually, bank deposits are cash equivalents. Alternatively, perhaps only Cash on Hand and Bank Deposits are considered, excluding Accounts Receivable, but that's not standard.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct quick assets are Cash + Accounts Receivable (excluding bank deposits and interest receivable), but that's not typical. Maybe the initial interpretation was correct, and the ratio is indeed ~15, indicating very high liquidity.\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's similar to the first ratio but sometimes calculated differently. Here, it seems identical to the first ratio, so:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n= -2.17 (same as first ratio)\n\nBut in the example, both were the same. So, we'll keep it as -2.17.\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholders' equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Shareholder's Equity}} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1,167,783.63\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Owner's Equity = 13,000,000.00\n- End Owner's Equity = 14,167,783.63\nAverage Owner's Equity:\n\\[ \\frac{13,000,000 + 14,167,783.63}{2} = \\frac{27,167,783.63}{2} \\approx 13,583,891.815 \\]\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{1,167,783.63}{13,583,891.815} \\approx 0.086 \\]\nMultiply by 100 for percentage:\n\\[ 0.086 \\times 100\\% = 8.6\\% \\]\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company collects receivables. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 3,397,619.40\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00\n- End Accounts Receivable = 2,902,136.39\nAverage Accounts Receivable:\n\\[ \\frac{0 + 2,902,136.39}{2} = 1,451,068.195 \\]\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{3,397,619.40}{1,451,068.195} \\approx 2.34 \\]\n\n*In the example, they might have used only the ending accounts receivable, but averaging is more accurate.*\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the summarized solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.17', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.04', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.24', 'Quick Ratio': '15.09', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.17', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '8.60%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.34'}}\n```\n\n**Reviewing the Quick Ratio:**\nThe Quick Ratio seems unusually high at 15.09, which suggests the company has a lot of liquid assets compared to its current liabilities. This could be accurate given the numbers:\n- Cash on Hand: ~2.34 million\n- Bank Deposits: ~4.29 million\n- Accounts Receivable: ~2.90 million\nTotal Quick Assets: ~9.53 million\nCurrent Liabilities: ~0.63 million\nSo, the calculation seems correct based on standard definitions.\n\nSimilarly, other ratios seem correctly calculated based on the provided data and standard formulas. The negative operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio indicates that operating cash flow is negative, which isn't ideal but is the case here. The ROE is positive, indicating profitability relative to equity. The accounts receivable turnover ratio of 2.34 suggests that receivables are turned over about 2.34 times during the period, which might be reasonable depending on the industry.",
