                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 9,891,156.92\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 631,880.98\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 9,891,156.92 / 631,880.98 ≈ 15.65\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand (End_amount) = 2,339,224.10\n- Bank Deposits (End_amount) = 4,292,000.00\n- Interest Receivable (End_amount) = 14,796.43\n- Accounts Receivable (End_amount) = 2,902,136.39\n- Total Current Liabilities = 631,880.98\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 2,339,224.10 + 4,292,000.00 + 14,796.43 + 2,902,136.39\n= 9,548,156.92\n\nQuick Ratio = 9,548,156.92 / 631,880.98 ≈ 15.11\n\n*Note:* Sometimes, Interest Receivable might not be included in quick assets, but since it's a short-term receivable, I included it here. If excluded, Quick Assets would be 9,533,360.49, and Quick Ratio ≈ 15.09. The difference is minimal in this case.\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since there are no non-current liabilities listed) = 631,880.98\n- Total Assets (End_amount) = 14,799,664.61\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 631,880.98 / 14,799,664.61 ≈ 0.0427 or 4.27%\n\n*Note:* If there are other liabilities not listed under current, this might change, but based on the given data, only current liabilities are present.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 631,880.98\n- Total Owner's Equity (End_amount) = 14,167,783.63\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 631,880.98 / 14,167,783.63 ≈ 0.0446 or 4.46%\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,368,775.90\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 631,880.98\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -1,368,775.90 / 631,880.98 ≈ -2.17\n\n*Note:* A negative ratio indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative, which isn't favorable for covering debt.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '15.65', 'Quick Ratio': '15.11', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.04', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.17'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check the calculations to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. **Current Ratio:** 9,891,156.92 / 631,880.98 = 15.654 (correct)\n2. **Quick Ratio:** (2,339,224.10 + 4,292,000.00 + 14,796.43 + 2,902,136.39) / 631,880.98 = 9,548,156.92 / 631,880.98 ≈ 15.11 (correct)\n3. **Debt to Asset:** 631,880.98 / 14,799,664.61 ≈ 0.0427 (rounded to 0.04)\n4. **Debt to Equity:** 631,880.98 / 14,167,783.63 ≈ 0.0446 (rounded to 0.04)\n5. **Cash Flow to Debt:** -1,368,775.90 / 631,880.98 ≈ -2.17 (correct)\n\nEverything checks out! The ratios are calculated based on the provided financial data.",
