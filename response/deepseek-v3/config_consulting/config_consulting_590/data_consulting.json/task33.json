                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one using the provided financial statements. I'll go through each ratio, explain what it means, and then calculate it step by step.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operating activities. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,368,775.90\nFrom the balance sheet (End_amount):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 631,880.98\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-1,368,775.90}{631,880.98} \\approx -2.17 \\]\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since there are no non-current liabilities listed) = 631,880.98\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-1,368,775.90}{631,880.98} \\approx -2.17 \\]\n\n*Note: This seems the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio because total liabilities equal current liabilities in this case.*\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 1,337,000.00\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Ending Inventory = 343,000.00\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00 (assuming no inventory at the start)\n\nAverage Inventory:\n\\[ \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Initial Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2} = \\frac{0 + 343,000}{2} = 171,500.00 \\]\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{1,337,000.00}{171,500.00} \\approx 7.80 \\]\n\n*Wait a minute, in the example provided, the Inventory Turnover Ratio was calculated differently. Maybe they used only the ending inventory instead of average. Let me check:*\n\nIf using only ending inventory:\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{1,337,000.00}{343,000.00} \\approx 3.90 \\]\n\nLooking back at the example, their Cost of Goods Sold was 4,410,000 and Inventory was 5,090,000 at the end, and they got 1.73, which is COGS / Ending Inventory. So, it seems they used ending inventory, not average. So, I'll do the same.\n\nRevised Calculation:\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{1,337,000.00}{343,000.00} \\approx 3.90 \\]\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio compares the company's total liabilities to its shareholders' equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 631,880.98\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,167,783.63\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{631,880.98}{14,167,783.63} \\approx 0.04 \\]\n\n*But in the example, they had Total Current Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity, which gave 0.16. Maybe they considered only current liabilities as debt. So, if we do that:*\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{631,880.98}{14,167,783.63} \\approx 0.04 \\]\n\nHmm, maybe the example had non-current liabilities not listed. Here, it's the same. Maybe it's correct as is.\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to meet short-term obligations with quick assets (cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash + Accounts Receivable}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 2,339,224.10\n- Bank Deposits = 4,292,000.00\n- Interest Receivable = 14,796.43\n- Accounts Receivable = 2,902,136.39\n- Current Liabilities = 631,880.98\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 2,339,224.10 + 4,292,000.00 + 14,796.43 + 2,902,136.39\n= 9,548,156.92\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{9,548,156.92}{631,880.98} \\approx 15.11 \\]\n\n*This seems very high. Maybe quick assets exclude interest receivable. Let's check the example:*\n\nIn the example, quick ratio was (Cash + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities, same as above. Theirs was 1.54. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" is just Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits, not including interest receivable.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement, Ending Balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents is 6,631,224.10, which is Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits (2,339,224.10 + 4,292,000.00 = 6,631,224.10). So, quick assets might be Cash and Cash Equivalents + Accounts Receivable.\n\nSo:\nQuick Assets = 6,631,224.10 (Cash and Cash Equivalents) + 2,902,136.39 (Accounts Receivable) = 9,533,360.49\n\nThen:\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{9,533,360.49}{631,880.98} \\approx 15.09 \\]\n\nStill very high. Maybe interest receivable is not included in quick assets. Let's exclude it:\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable\n= 2,339,224.10 + 4,292,000.00 + 2,902,136.39 = 9,533,360.49\n\nSame as above. Maybe the example included interest receivable, but their quick ratio was lower because their current liabilities were higher relative to quick assets.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the company indeed has a very high quick ratio.\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to pay short-term obligations with current assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 9,891,156.92\n- Current Liabilities = 631,880.98\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{9,891,156.92}{631,880.98} \\approx 15.65 \\]\n\nAgain, very high, but mathematically correct based on the numbers.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.17', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.17', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '3.90', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.04', 'Quick Ratio': '15.09', 'Current Ratio': '15.65'}}\n```\n\n*Note: The high Quick and Current Ratios suggest the company has significantly more current assets than current liabilities, which is unusual but possible given the data. Similarly, the negative Operating Cash Flow and Cash Flow to Debt Ratios indicate that the company's operating activities are generating negative cash flow relative to its liabilities.*",
