                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: Return on Equity (ROE), Debt to Asset Ratio, and Gross Profit Margin. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Return on Equity (ROE)**: This measures how effectively a company is using its shareholders' equity to generate profit. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Shareholder's Equity}} \\times 100\\%\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Debt to Asset Ratio**: This indicates the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Gross Profit Margin**: This shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100\\%\n   \\]\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the provided financial statements, let's identify the numbers we need:\n\n1. **Net Profit**: Found in the income statement at the bottom.\n   - Net Profit = 1,167,783.63\n\n2. **Shareholder's Equity**: From the balance sheet under \"Total Owner's Equity\".\n   - Total Owner's Equity = 14,167,783.63\n\n3. **Total Liabilities**: From the balance sheet under \"Total Current Liabilities\" (since there are no non-current liabilities mentioned).\n   - Total Current Liabilities = 631,880.98\n\n4. **Total Assets**: From the balance sheet.\n   - Total Assets = 14,799,664.61\n\n5. **Gross Profit**: From the income statement.\n   - Gross Profit = 2,060,619.40\n\n6. **Total Revenue**: From the income statement.\n   - Total Revenue = 3,397,619.40\n\n### Calculating the Ratios\n\nNow, let's plug these numbers into our formulas.\n\n1. **Return on Equity (ROE)**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ROE} = \\frac{1,167,783.63}{14,167,783.63} \\times 100\\% \\approx \\frac{1,167,783.63}{14,167,783.63} \\times 100\\% \\approx 0.0824 \\times 100\\% \\approx 8.24\\%\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Debt to Asset Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{631,880.98}{14,799,664.61} \\approx \\frac{631,880.98}{14,799,664.61} \\approx 0.0427\n   \\]\n   (This can be rounded to 0.04 or expressed as 4.27% if needed, but typically this ratio is presented as a decimal.)\n\n3. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{2,060,619.40}{3,397,619.40} \\times 100\\% \\approx \\frac{2,060,619.40}{3,397,619.40} \\times 100\\% \\approx 0.6065 \\times 100\\% \\approx 60.65\\%\n   \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **ROE**:\n   - 1,167,783.63 / 14,167,783.63 ≈ 0.0824 → 8.24%\n   \n2. **Debt to Asset Ratio**:\n   - 631,880.98 / 14,799,664.61 ≈ 0.0427\n   \n3. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - 2,060,619.40 / 3,397,619.40 ≈ 0.6065 → 60.65%\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '8.24%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04', 'Gross Profit Margin': '60.65%'} }\n```\n\n### Explanation of Results\n\n- **ROE (8.24%)**: This means that for every dollar of shareholder equity, the company generated about 8.24 cents in profit. This is a decent return, indicating that the company is effectively using its equity to generate profits.\n  \n- **Debt to Asset Ratio (0.04)**: This ratio is quite low, suggesting that only 4% of the company's assets are financed by debt. The company is not heavily leveraged, which is generally a sign of financial stability.\n  \n- **Gross Profit Margin (60.65%)**: This is a high margin, indicating that the company retains a significant portion of its revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This suggests strong pricing power or efficient cost management in production.\n\nThese metrics collectively suggest that the company is in a healthy financial position with good profitability and low debt levels.",
