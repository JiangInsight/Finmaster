                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each of the three required ratios: Debt to Equity Ratio, Net Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio. \n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's debt relative to its equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 631,880.98\n- There doesn't seem to be any long-term liabilities mentioned, so **Total Liabilities** = Total Current Liabilities = 631,880.98\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 14,167,783.63\n\nNow, plug in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{631,880.98}{14,167,783.63} \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{631,880.98}{14,167,783.63} \\approx 0.0446 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.0446 or 4.46%. \n\nBut looking at the example provided, the ratio was given as a simple decimal without percentage, so we'll present it as '0.04' (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nWait, let's check the example's calculation to ensure we're rounding similarly.\n\nIn the example:\n- Total Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\n- Total Owner's Equity: 11,354,858.57\n- Ratio: 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.1639, presented as '0.16'\n\nSo, similarly, we'll present ours as '0.04'.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net profit is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** 1,167,783.63\n- **Total Revenue:** 3,397,619.40\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,167,783.63}{3,397,619.40} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,167,783.63}{3,397,619.40} \\approx 0.3437 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.3437 \\times 100 \\approx 34.37\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is approximately 34.37%.\n\nIn the example, it was presented as '-30.29%', so we'll present ours similarly as '34.37%'.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to cover its current liabilities with cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -1,368,775.90\n- From the balance sheet:\n  - **Total Current Liabilities:** 631,880.98\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-1,368,775.90}{631,880.98} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{-1,368,775.90}{631,880.98} \\approx -2.166 \\]\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately -2.17 (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nIn the example, it was '-3.90', so we'll present ours similarly as '-2.17'.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.04', 'Net Profit Margin': '34.37%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.17'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity:**\n   - Liabilities: 631,880.98\n   - Equity: 14,167,783.63\n   - 631,880.98 / 14,167,783.63 ≈ 0.0446 → '0.04' (correct)\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - Net Profit: 1,167,783.63\n   - Revenue: 3,397,619.40\n   - (1,167,783.63 / 3,397,619.40) * 100 ≈ 34.37% (correct)\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -1,368,775.90\n   - Current Liabilities: 631,880.98\n   - -1,368,775.90 / 631,880.98 ≈ -2.166 → '-2.17' (correct)\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.04', 'Net Profit Margin': '34.37%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.17'} }\n```",
