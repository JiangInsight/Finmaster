                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement analysis step by step. We need to calculate two key ratios: the Gross Profit Margin and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows how much gross profit a company makes from its sales. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**: This measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow from its operations. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the provided financial statements, let's pick out the numbers we need.\n\n#### Income Statement:\n- **Total Revenue**: 3,397,619.40\n- **Gross Profit**: 2,060,619.40\n\n#### Cash Flow Statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -1,368,775.90\n\n#### Balance Sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 631,880.98\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,060,619.40}{3,397,619.40} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\\[\n\\frac{2,060,619.40}{3,397,619.40} \\approx 0.6065\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\\[\n0.6065 \\times 100\\% \\approx 60.65\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **60.65%**.\n\n### Calculating Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-1,368,775.90}{631,880.98}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{-1,368,775.90}{631,880.98} \\approx -2.166\n\\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately **-2.17**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit: 2,060,619.40\n   - Total Revenue: 3,397,619.40\n   - 2,060,619.40 / 3,397,619.40 ≈ 0.6065 → 60.65%\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**:\n   - Net Operating Cash Flow: -1,368,775.90\n   - Current Liabilities: 631,880.98\n   - -1,368,775.90 / 631,880.98 ≈ -2.166 → -2.17\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '60.65%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.17'}}\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- The Gross Profit Margin is quite high at 60.65%, indicating that the company retains a significant portion of revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold.\n- The Operating Cash Flow Ratio is negative (-2.17), which suggests that the company's operating cash flow is insufficient to cover its current liabilities. This could be a concern unless it's a temporary situation due to, for example, significant investments in receivables or inventory, as seen by the increases in Accounts Receivable and Inventory in the cash flow statement.\n\nThis analysis provides a snapshot of the company's profitability and liquidity based on the given financial statements.",
