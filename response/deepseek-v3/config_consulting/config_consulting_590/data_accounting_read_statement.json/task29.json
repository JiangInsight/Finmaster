Here, both \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\" are present with the same value, indicating that the main business revenue is the sole component of total revenue.\n\n- **Total Revenue**: 3397619.40\n\n### Decomposing into Sub-items\n\nThe task asks to decompose the total income into 1 component sub-item. From the table, \"Main Business Revenue\" is the direct component that makes up the \"Total Revenue\".\n\n- **Sub-item**: Main Business Revenue\n- **Value**: 3397619.40\n\nSince there's only one sub-item, its initial and final values are the same.\n\n### Verifying Against the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5431018.59', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '5431018.59'}}}\n```\n\nHere, the 'value' is the \"Total Revenue\", and the 'sub_item value' is the \"Main Business Revenue\", both being the same since it's the only component.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, \"Total Revenue\" and \"Main Business Revenue\" are the same, so the structure should mirror the example.\n\n### Constructing the Solution\n\nFollowing the example's structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3397619.40', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '3397619.40'}}}\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"3397619.40\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value\": \"3397619.40\"}}}\n```",
