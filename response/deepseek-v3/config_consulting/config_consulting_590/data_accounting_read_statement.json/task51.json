In this case, it is `0.00` as of the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - From the same \"Interest Receivable\" account in the balance sheet, the \"End_amount\" is provided. Here, it is `14796.43` as of the end date `2024-02-05`.\n\n4. **Verify with Other Statements**:\n   - The cash flow statement shows a line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" with an amount of `-14796.43`, which matches the increase in the \"Interest Receivable\" account from `0.00` to `14796.43`.\n   - The income statement shows \"Interest Income\" of `14796.43`, which corresponds to the interest accrued during the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '14796.43'}}\n```",
