A negative value indicates an increase in inventory (which is a reduction in cash flow), while a positive value would indicate a decrease in inventory (which is an increase in cash flow).\n\nThus, the value we are looking for is \"-343000.00\". \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-343000.00'}}\n```",
