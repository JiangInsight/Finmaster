                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement analysis step by step. I'm going to identify and extract three specific line items from the given financial statements based on the task description. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three values:\n1. **Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit**: This typically refers to \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually labeled as \"Financial Expenses\" in the income statement.\n3. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is often found as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the cash flow statement.\n\nThe order of extraction is:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n### Analyzing the Given Financial Statements\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\nLooking at the balance sheet, we're interested in \"Accounts Receivable\". Here's the relevant line:\n\n| Account | Initial_amount | Initial_date | End_amount | End_date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Accounts Receivable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 2902136.39 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nSo, the amount owed to the entity is **2902136.39**.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\nNext, we look for \"Financial Expenses\" in the income statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Financial Expenses | 54544.72 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThe financing costs are **54544.72**.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nFinally, we check the cash flow statement for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\":\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThe cash payments for long-term assets are **0.00**.\n\n### Verifying the Line Items\nJust to ensure I'm picking the right items:\n- **Accounts Receivable**: Correct, as it's money owed by customers for credit sales.\n- **Financial Expenses**: Correct, these are costs related to financing (like interest on loans).\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: Correct, this represents cash spent on acquiring long-term assets like property or equipment.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2902136.39', 'value2': '54544.72', 'value3': '0.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. **Accounts Receivable (Balance Sheet)**: Found under current assets with an end amount of 2902136.39.\n2. **Financial Expenses (Income Statement)**: Listed as 54544.72.\n3. **Purchase of Fixed Assets (Cash Flow Statement)**: Listed as 0.00.\n\nThus, the extracted values are correctly identified and ordered as per the task instructions.",
