This is because COGS reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, which includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the goods, and the carrying amount of inventories sold.\n\nFrom the given problem, the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is listed with an amount of \"1337000.00\".\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1337000.00'} }\n```",
