                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract two specific line items from the income statement:\n\n1. **Income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities**: This is typically the \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Revenue from Operations\" line item, as it represents the income generated from the entity's primary business activities.\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is typically the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) line item, as it represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the entity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the line item for core operating income**:\n   - In the given income statement, the line item \"Main Business Revenue\" clearly represents the income from core operating activities. The amount is `3397619.40`.\n\n2. **Identify the line item for the carrying amount of inventories sold**:\n   - The line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period. The amount is `1337000.00`.\n\n3. **Extract the values in the original order**:\n   - The \"Main Business Revenue\" appears before \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the income statement, so `value1` will be the amount from \"Main Business Revenue\" and `value2` will be the amount from \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3397619.40', 'value2': '1337000.00'}}\n```",
