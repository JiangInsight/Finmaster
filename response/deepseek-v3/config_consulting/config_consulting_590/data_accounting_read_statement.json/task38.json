                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line item and value that represents the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit during the period. This is typically reflected in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section as \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task asks for the value that shows the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit. This is captured by the change in \"Accounts Receivable\" in the cash flow statement. A decrease in accounts receivable means that the entity has collected cash from its customers, which is a positive cash flow. However, in the cash flow statement, an increase in accounts receivable is shown as a negative value (because it represents cash not yet collected), and a decrease is shown as a positive value (because it represents cash collected).\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the given problem, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is present with a value of \"-2902136.39\". The negative sign indicates an increase in accounts receivable (i.e., amounts owed to the entity have increased, not decreased). However, the task specifically asks for the \"decrease\" in amounts owed. Since the value is negative, it means there was no decrease; instead, there was an increase. \n\n   - If the task is interpreted as asking for the value that represents the change in amounts owed (regardless of increase or decrease), then the value is \"-2902136.39\". \n   - If the task strictly asks for a \"decrease,\" then the value would be positive (but no such value exists in this example). \n\n   Given the example provided in the task description, the solution extracted the negative value for \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" even though it represented an increase. Therefore, we will follow the same approach here.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value for \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is \"-2902136.39\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2902136.39'}}\n```",
