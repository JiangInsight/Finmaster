In the input, \"Accounts Receivable\" appears before \"Accounts Payable\", so:\n     - `initial value1` and `end valu1` correspond to \"Accounts Receivable\".\n     - `initial value2` and `end valu2` correspond to \"Accounts Payable\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '0.00', 'end valu1': '2902136.39', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '462000.00'} }\n```",
