I'm going to go through each part of the problem to identify and extract the three specific line items as described.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to extract three specific values from the financial statements provided:\n\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under \"Paid-in Capital\" or similar.\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is usually the \"Profit Before Tax\" line in the Income Statement.\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This refers to the increase in \"Accounts Payable,\" which can be found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\"\n\nThe order of extraction is important: Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement, then Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### Extracting the Values\n\nLet's go through each financial statement one by one.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet section, we're interested in the capital contributed by shareholders. This is typically labeled as \"Paid-in Capital.\"\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n```\nPaid-in Capital | 13000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 13000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThe \"End_amount\" for Paid-in Capital is `13000000.00`. This hasn't changed from the initial amount, but since we're asked for the end value, it's `13000000.00`.\n\nSo, `value1 = '13000000.00'`.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nNext, we need the profit or loss before tax. This is the \"Profit Before Tax\" line.\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n```\nProfit Before Tax | 1337664.61 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThe amount here is `1337664.61`.\n\nSo, `value2 = '1337664.61'`.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nNow, we need the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period. This is the increase in \"Accounts Payable.\"\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n```\nIncrease (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 462000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThe amount here is `462000.00`, indicating an increase in Accounts Payable.\n\nSo, `value3 = '462000.00'`.\n\n### Verifying the Values\n\nLet's double-check each value to ensure accuracy:\n\n1. **Paid-in Capital**: Confirmed as `13000000.00` in the Balance Sheet.\n2. **Profit Before Tax**: Confirmed as `1337664.61` in the Income Statement.\n3. **Increase in Accounts Payable**: Confirmed as `462000.00` in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nAll values are correctly identified from their respective statements.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1337664.61', 'value3': '462000.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Identify the three required line items**:\n   - Capital contributed by shareholders: Balance Sheet → Paid-in Capital.\n   - Profit before tax: Income Statement → Profit Before Tax.\n   - Increase in accounts payable: Cash Flow Statement → Increase in Accounts Payable.\n\n2. **Locate each item in the respective financial statements**:\n   - Balance Sheet: Found \"Paid-in Capital\" with an end amount of `13000000.00`.\n   - Income Statement: Found \"Profit Before Tax\" as `1337664.61`.\n   - Cash Flow Statement: Found \"Increase in Accounts Payable\" as `462000.00`.\n\n3. **Ensure the order is correct**:\n   - Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement, then Cash Flow Statement.\n\n4. **Compile the values into the JSON solution format**.\n\nThus, the final solution is accurate and meets all the specified requirements.",
