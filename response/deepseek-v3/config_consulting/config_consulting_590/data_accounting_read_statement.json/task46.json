I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nFirst, let's understand what the task is asking. We're given a cash flow statement, and we need to:\n\n1. **Identify and extract** the specific line item and its value that represents the \"net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends.\"\n\n   - This sounds like the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section, specifically the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" line.\n\n2. **Decompose this item into 1 component sub-item**, which must also come from the input statement. \n\n   - From the example provided, the sub-item seems to be the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which is part of the investing activities.\n\n3. For each sub-item, output its final value.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nNow, let's look at the provided cash flow statement:\n\n```\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit  | 1167783.63 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation  | 91492.31 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -2902136.39 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -14796.43 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -343000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 462000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 169880.98 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -1368775.90 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Ending Balance  | 6631224.10 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Increase  | -1368775.90 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\n\nFrom this:\n\n1. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: This is the line we're interested in, which is `-0.00` in this case.\n   \n2. **Sub-item**: The only component listed under investing activities is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which is `0.00`.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the example provided:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-305354.43', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '305354.43'}}}\n```\n\n- The \"value\" is the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" which is `-305354.43`.\n- The \"sub_item value\" is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which is `305354.43` (positive because the net is negative, implying it's an outflow).\n\nIn our problem:\n\n- \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is `-0.00`.\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is `0.00`.\n\n### Potential Confusion\n\nInitially, I wondered why the sub_item value in the example is positive when the net is negative. It's because \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is an outflow (negative impact on cash), but the amount is presented as a positive number in the table, and the net is the sum (or in this case, just this one item) with a negative sign.\n\nIn our case, since the purchase is `0.00`, the net is also `-0.00`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on this, the solution should be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '0.00'}}}\n```\n\nHowever, looking at the example's structure, it seems the sub_items are directly under 'sub_items' with a key 'sub_item value'. So, replicating that:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '0.00'}}}\n```\n\nBut the instruction says to present in the format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '______', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '______'} }\n```\n\nThis seems slightly different from the example's structure. Maybe it's a typo, and it should be 'sub_items' as a dictionary inside 'solution'. \n\nGiven that, and to match the instruction's format exactly (assuming 'sub_items_sub_item value' is a concatenated key), it would be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '0.00'}}\n```\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with the example where 'sub_items' is a nested dictionary. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll go with the structure that matches the example, which seems more logical:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '0.00'}}}\n```\n\nBut since the instruction specifies a different format, perhaps the 'sub_items' is not nested. Maybe it's a flat dictionary with concatenated keys. \n\nGiven the instruction's format, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '0.00'}}\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully considering the structure, the most accurate response following the instruction's format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '0.00'}}\n```",
