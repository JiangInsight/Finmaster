                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand what exactly we're being asked to do and how to find the required information from the given financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to identify and extract two specific line items and their values from the financial statements provided. These line items are:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers.**\n2. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.**\n\nThe financial statements are grouped in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, we should maintain the original line item order as shown in the input.\n\nFrom the example provided, it seems that:\n\n- The first value (`value1`) corresponds to \"Selling Expenses\" from the Income Statement, which likely represents costs to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services.\n- The second value (`value2`) corresponds to \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" from the Cash Flow Statement, representing cash payments for long-term assets.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nLet's look at the financial statements provided in the problem to solve.\n\n#### 1. Income Statement\n\nLooking at the Income Statement, we have the following line items related to expenses:\n\n- Administrative Expenses: 271,886.07\n- Selling Expenses: 319,828.12\n- Depreciation: 91,492.31\n- Financial Expenses: 54,544.72\n- Total Expenses: 737,751.22\n\nHere, \"Selling Expenses\" seems to be the cost related to securing customer orders and delivering goods/services. So, `value1` should be \"319828.12\".\n\n#### 2. Cash Flow Statement\n\nNow, let's look at the Cash Flow Statement, specifically the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section:\n\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 0.00\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -0.00\n\nThis indicates that there were no cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment during this period. So, `value2` should be \"0.00\".\n\n#### Balance Sheet\n\nThe Balance Sheet doesn't seem to have direct line items for the costs we're interested in, so we can skip it for this task.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nIn the example provided:\n\n- `value1` was \"Selling Expenses\": 493,854.67\n- `value2` was \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": 305,354.43\n\nThis confirms our approach is correct: look for \"Selling Expenses\" in the Income Statement and \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the above analysis:\n\n- `value1` (Selling Expenses): \"319828.12\"\n- `value2` (Purchase of Fixed Assets): \"0.00\"\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '319828.12', 'value2': '0.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**:\n   - Costs to secure orders and deliver goods/services → \"Selling Expenses\" in Income Statement.\n   - Cash payments for long-term assets → \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in Cash Flow Statement.\n\n2. **Locate in Financial Statements**:\n   - Income Statement: Found \"Selling Expenses\" = 319,828.12.\n   - Cash Flow Statement: Found \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = 0.00.\n\n3. **Construct the Answer**:\n   - Assign the found values to `value1` and `value2` respectively.\n\n4. **Verify with Example**:\n   - Confirmed that similar line items were used in the example for the same purpose.\n\nThus, the final answer is accurate based on the given data.",
