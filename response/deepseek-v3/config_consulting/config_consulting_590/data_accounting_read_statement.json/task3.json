This typically refers to \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet, as it represents the money owed to the entity by its customers for goods or services delivered on credit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - Look for the line item labeled \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet. This is the standard account that tracks amounts owed to the entity for credit sales.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" column under \"Accounts Receivable\" gives the initial value at the start of the period.\n   - The \"End_amount\" column under \"Accounts Receivable\" gives the final value at the end of the period.\n\n3. **Locate the Values in the Given Problem**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, \"Accounts Receivable\" has:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00\n     - End_amount: 2902136.39\n\n4. **Format the Solution**:\n   - The solution should be presented in the specified JSON format with the initial and end values for \"Accounts Receivable\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '2902136.39'} }\n```",
