This is typically labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, we can see the following line items under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\":\n   - Net Profit\n   - Depreciation\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\n   - **Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable**\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" has a value of \"169880.98\" for the date \"2024-02-05\". This value represents the increase in tax accrued but not yet paid.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The value is positive, indicating an increase in tax payable (i.e., more tax has been accrued but not yet paid). This aligns with the task's requirement.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '169880.98'}}\n```",
