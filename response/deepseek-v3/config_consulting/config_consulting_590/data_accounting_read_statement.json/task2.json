The line item we are interested in is \"Bank Deposits,\" which represents the initial and final values of the funds deposited into a bank.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item:**\n   - Look for the \"Bank Deposits\" row in the balance sheet. This row contains the initial and end amounts of the funds deposited into a bank.\n\n2. **Extract the Initial Value:**\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" column for \"Bank Deposits\" is \"5000000.00\". This is the initial value of the funds deposited into the bank.\n\n3. **Extract the End Value:**\n   - The \"End_amount\" column for \"Bank Deposits\" is \"4292000.00\". This is the final value of the funds deposited into the bank at the end date.\n\n4. **Construct the Solution:**\n   - The solution should be presented in the specified JSON format with the initial and end values for \"Bank Deposits.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '4292000.00'} }\n```",
