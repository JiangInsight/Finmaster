These items are typically categorized under \"Fixed Assets\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The balance sheet includes a line item labeled \"Fixed Assets,\" which represents tangible assets used in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes.\n   - The \"Fixed Assets\" line item is found under the \"Non-current Assets\" section.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Fixed Assets\" is provided as \"5000000.00\" on the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Fixed Assets\" is provided as \"5000000.00\" on the end date \"2024-02-05\".\n   - However, we also notice that there is an \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item, which reduces the value of fixed assets over time. The end value of \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is \"91492.31\".\n   - The \"Total Non-current Assets\" is calculated as \"Fixed Assets\" minus \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" which is \"5000000.00 - 91492.31 = 4908507.69\". This is the net book value of the fixed assets at the end date.\n\n4. **Determine Which Value to Use**:\n   - The task asks for the value of tangible items held for use, which is the gross value of fixed assets (before depreciation). Therefore, we should use the \"Fixed Assets\" line item values directly, not the net value after depreciation.\n   - The initial value is \"5000000.00\", and the end value is also \"5000000.00\" (since the gross value of fixed assets hasn't changed, only the accumulated depreciation has increased).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5000000.00'} }\n```",
