This is typically referred to as \"Depreciation\" in financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Task**: The task asks for the value of depreciation, which is the systematic allocation of the cost of an asset over its useful life. This value can be found in the financial statements under \"Depreciation.\"\n\n2. **Locating Depreciation in the Financial Statements**:\n   - **Balance Sheet**: The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item shows the total depreciation accumulated over time. In the given balance sheet, the \"Accumulated Depreciation\" at the end date (2024-02-05) is `91492.31`. However, this is the accumulated value, not the periodic depreciation expense.\n   - **Income Statement**: The \"Depreciation\" line item under expenses shows the depreciation expense for the period. Here, it is `91492.31`.\n   - **Cash Flow Statement**: The \"Depreciation\" line item under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" also shows the depreciation expense for the period, which is `91492.31`.\n\n3. **Verification**: The depreciation expense should be the same in both the income statement and the cash flow statement. In this case, both show `91492.31`, confirming the correct value.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The value of the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life (depreciation expense) for the period is `91492.31`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91492.31'} }\n```",
