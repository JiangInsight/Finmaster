In the given problem, it is listed as \"Total Revenue\" with an amount of \"3397619.40\".\n   - **Total Cost**: This is the total cost associated with generating the revenue, primarily the \"Cost of Goods Sold\". In the given problem, it is listed as \"Total Cost\" with an amount of \"1337000.00\".\n\n2. **Find the Difference Between Revenue and Cost**:\n   - The difference between revenue and cost is typically labeled as \"Gross Profit\" in an income statement. This is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Gross Profit} = \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Total Cost}\n     \\]\n   - In the given problem, \"Gross Profit\" is explicitly listed with an amount of \"2060619.40\".\n\n3. **Verify the Calculation**:\n   - Let's verify the calculation:\n     \\[\n     3397619.40 (\\text{Total Revenue}) - 1337000.00 (\\text{Total Cost}) = 2060619.40 (\\text{Gross Profit})\n     \\]\n   - This matches the value provided in the \"Gross Profit\" line item, confirming its correctness.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**:\n   - The value we are interested in is the \"Gross Profit\", which is \"2060619.40\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2060619.40'}}\n```",
