                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through the cash flow statement provided and identify the four specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nFirst, let's recap what we're supposed to extract based on the task description:\n\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This refers to \"Depreciation.\"\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period**: This refers to the change in \"Inventory,\" specifically \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory.\"\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends**: This is the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\"\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nNow, let's find these items in the provided cash flow statement.\n\n### Extracting the Values\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement:\n\n1. **Depreciation**:\n   - Line item: \"Depreciation\"\n   - Amount: \"91492.31\"\n   \n2. **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**:\n   - Line item: \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\"\n   - Amount: \"-343000.00\"\n   \n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - Line item: \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\"\n   - Amount: \"-0.00\" (Note: This is shown as \"-0.00\" which is essentially zero, but we'll take the exact value provided.)\n   \n4. **Net Increase**:\n   - Line item: \"Net Increase\"\n   - Amount: \"-1368775.90\"\n\n### Verifying the Order\n\nThe task mentions that for multiple outputs, we should maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement. Looking at the order in the statement:\n\n1. Depreciation appears first among these four.\n2. Then (Increase) Decrease in Inventory.\n3. Then Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\n4. Finally, Net Increase.\n\nThis matches the order we've listed them in.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, let's put these values into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91492.31', 'value2': '-343000.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '-1368775.90'} }\n```\n\n### Double-Checking\n\nJust to ensure I didn't miss anything:\n\n- **Value1 (Depreciation)**: Correctly identified as \"91492.31\".\n- **Value2 (Inventory change)**: Correctly identified as \"-343000.00\".\n- **Value3 (Investing Activities)**: It's \"-0.00\", which might seem odd, but that's what's stated.\n- **Value4 (Net Increase)**: Correctly identified as \"-1368775.90\".\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91492.31', 'value2': '-343000.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '-1368775.90'} }\n```",
