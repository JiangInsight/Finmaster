This line item is typically called \"Retained Earnings.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Retained Earnings\" is present under the \"Owner's Equity\" section. This line item represents the cumulative net income or loss retained in the business after accounting for any dividends or distributions to shareholders.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Retained Earnings\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Retained Earnings\" is `1167783.63` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-02-05`.\n\n3. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The initial value is `0.00`, indicating no retained earnings at the start of the period.\n   - The end value is `1167783.63`, indicating a positive retained earnings balance at the end of the period, which means the entity has accumulated profits.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1167783.63'} }\n```",
