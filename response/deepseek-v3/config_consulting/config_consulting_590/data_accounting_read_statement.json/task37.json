This is a non-cash expense that is typically listed under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section of the cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, we look for the line item labeled \"Depreciation\" under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with the \"Depreciation\" line item is the amount we need to extract. In the given problem, the value is \"91492.31\".\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: Ensure that the extracted value is indeed under the \"Depreciation\" line item and not another line item. The context confirms that \"Depreciation\" is correctly labeled and the value is \"91492.31\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91492.31'} }\n```",
