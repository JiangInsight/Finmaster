These are typically referred to as \"Current Assets\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Assets**: Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within one year or the operating cycle of the business, whichever is longer. In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of all such assets.\n\n2. **Locate Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Current Assets\" is `8000000.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Assets\" is `9891156.92` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-02-05`.\n\n3. **Verify Non-Current Assets**: For completeness, we can confirm that \"Total Non-current Assets\" (like fixed assets) are not included in this calculation, as they are not expected to be realized or consumed within the operating cycle.\n\n4. **Total Assets**: The \"Total Assets\" line includes both current and non-current assets, but we are only interested in the current assets portion for this task.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe initial and end values of the total current assets are extracted as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '9891156.92'} }\n```",
