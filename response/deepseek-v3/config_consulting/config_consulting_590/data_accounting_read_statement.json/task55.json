However, the \"Tax Expense\" in the income statement represents the tax incurred during the reporting period, which is the amount the entity is expected to pay.\n\n2. **Locate the Value**:\n   - In the income statement, the \"Tax Expense\" line item has a value of \"169880.98\" for the date \"2024-02-05\".\n   - This value matches the \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" in the cash flow statement, which is \"169880.98\", and the \"Taxes Payable\" in the balance sheet, which is also \"169880.98\". This consistency confirms that the tax amount for the reporting period is \"169880.98\".\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period is \"169880.98\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '169880.98'}}\n```",
