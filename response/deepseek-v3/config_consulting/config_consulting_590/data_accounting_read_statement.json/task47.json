                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand how to find the net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period, and then identify its two component sub-items from the given cash flow statement.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's recall what a cash flow statement shows. It provides information about the cash inflows and outflows of a company during a specific period, categorized into three main activities:\n1. **Operating Activities**: Cash flows from the primary business operations.\n2. **Investing Activities**: Cash flows from the purchase and sale of long-term assets.\n3. **Financing Activities**: Cash flows related to borrowing, repaying debt, issuing stock, or paying dividends.\n\nHowever, in the given problem, we don't see a \"Financing Activities\" section, but we do have \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" which shows the beginning and ending balances along with the net increase or decrease.\n\n### Identifying the Net Addition in Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe \"net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\" is essentially the net change in cash from the beginning to the end of the period. In the cash flow statement, this is usually labeled as \"Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents.\"\n\nLooking at the provided statement:\n```\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Ending Balance  | 6631224.10 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Increase  | -1368775.90 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nHere, the \"Net Increase\" is shown as `-1368775.90`. This means there was a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\n### Verifying the Net Increase\n\nThe net increase should theoretically be the sum of the net cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities. In our case:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: `-1368775.90`\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: `-0.00`\n- Net Cash Flow from Financing Activities: Not provided, but assuming it's `0.00` since it's not mentioned.\n\nAdding these:\n`-1368775.90 (Operating) + -0.00 (Investing) + 0.00 (Financing) = -1368775.90`\n\nThis matches the \"Net Increase\" shown in the cash and cash equivalents section, confirming our understanding.\n\n### Decomposing the Net Addition into Two Sub-items\n\nThe problem asks us to decompose the net addition into two sub-items that originate from the input statement. \n\nLooking at the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, the two main components that lead to the net increase are:\n1. **Beginning Balance**: The amount of cash at the start of the period.\n2. **Ending Balance**: The amount of cash at the end of the period.\n\nThe net increase is calculated as:\n`Net Increase = Ending Balance - Beginning Balance`\n\nSo, the two sub-items are:\n1. Beginning Balance: `8000000.00`\n2. Ending Balance: `6631224.10`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together:\n- The value of the net addition (net increase) in cash and cash equivalents is `-1368775.90`.\n- The two sub-items are the beginning and ending balances:\n  - sub_item value1 (Beginning Balance): `8000000.00`\n  - sub_item value2 (Ending Balance): `6631224.10`\n\nHere's the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-1368775.90\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value1\": \"8000000.00\", \"sub_item value2\": \"6631224.10\"}}}\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet's verify the calculation:\n`Ending Balance - Beginning Balance = 6631224.10 - 8000000.00 = -1368775.90`\nThis matches the \"Net Increase\" value, confirming our answer is correct.",
