                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to calculate the total owner's equity in the balance sheet, including both the initial and final amounts. Owner's equity is calculated as the difference between total assets and total liabilities. \n\n### Step 1: Calculate Initial Owner's Equity\nThe initial owner's equity is the sum of all initial assets. From the transactions data, the initial assets are:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.0\n\nInitial Owner's Equity = Cash deposit + Bank deposit + Fixed Assets  \nInitial Owner's Equity = 3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 = 13,000,000.0\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Final Owner's Equity\nThe final owner's equity is the initial owner's equity plus net income (or minus net loss) minus any withdrawals or dividends (which are not present in this data). \n\nNet income is calculated as total revenue minus total expenses. \n\n#### Total Revenue:\nFrom the transactions data, revenue comes from sales. Sum all the \"Sale\" transactions where the amount is positive (since sales increase revenue).\n\nFrom the data, the sales amounts are:\n- 284,230.98\n- 274,894.93\n- 287,021.71\n- 180,661.23\n- 2,041.74\n- 285,922.71\n- 1,925.47\n- 295,859.81\n- 2,212.39\n- 277,286.94\n- 193,204.06\n- 13,759.13\n- 2,203.63\n- 241,259.43\n- 264,938.80\n- 216,405.22\n- 272,245.21\n- 2,313.08\n- 241,168.27\n- 2,255.80\n- 11,896.81\n- 41,527.91\n\nSum of Sales = 3,153,063.52\n\n#### Total Expenses:\nFrom the transactions data, expenses include administrative expenses, sales expenses, financial expenses, depreciation, and interest expenses (though interest receivables are an asset, not an expense). \n\nSum all the expense transactions:\n- Administrative Expenses: Sum of all \"Administrative Expenses\" amounts\n- Sales Expenses: Sum of all \"Sales Expenses\" amounts\n- Financial Expenses: Sum of all \"Financial Expenses\" amounts\n- Depreciation: Sum of all \"Depreciation\" amounts\n\nFrom the data:\n- Administrative Expenses: Sum of all amounts labeled \"Administrative Expenses\" = 7069.68 + 13381.35 + 18522.55 + 7550.68 + 17921.98 + 16893.65 + 9840.4 + 16654.12 + 4461.27 + 12390.55 + 17013.85 + 18333.0 + 2784.18 + 13728.52 + 19421.61 + 3082.57 + 15370.59 + 6121.99 + 15719.57 + 13782.27 = 223,223.72\n- Sales Expenses: Sum of all amounts labeled \"Sales Expenses\" = 13305.95 + 11861.78 + 13930.48 + 12925.57 + 8666.24 + 14246.91 + 16705.92 + 19270.58 + 3803.96 + 19701.69 + 13134.95 + 13669.93 + 10766.33 + 5600.05 + 8771.29 + 10538.58 + 17948.72 + 11989.77 + 8398.64 + 5737.39 + 14261.76 + 5081.0 + 3342.58 + 16033.09 + 13137.94 + 8191.03 + 3938.06 + 8383.91 = 277,734.56\n- Financial Expenses: Sum of all amounts labeled \"Financial Expenses\" = 7928.54 + 7754.91 + 3133.97 + 4579.76 + 15308.56 + 6837.24 = 45,735.98\n- Depreciation: Sum of all amounts labeled \"Depreciation\" = 45747.38 + 45744.93 = 91,492.31\n\nTotal Expenses = Administrative Expenses + Sales Expenses + Financial Expenses + Depreciation  \nTotal Expenses = 223,223.72 + 277,734.56 + 45,735.98 + 91,492.31 = 638,186.57\n\n#### Net Income:\nNet Income = Total Revenue - Total Expenses  \nNet Income = 3,153,063.52 - 638,186.57 = 2,514,876.95\n\n#### Final Owner's Equity:\nFinal Owner's Equity = Initial Owner's Equity + Net Income  \nFinal Owner's Equity = 13,000,000.0 + 2,514,876.95 = 15,514,876.95\n\n### Step 3: Format the Answer\nThe initial and final owner's equity values are formatted to two decimal places as strings.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Owners Equity Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Total Owners Equity End Value': '15514876.95'} }\n```",
