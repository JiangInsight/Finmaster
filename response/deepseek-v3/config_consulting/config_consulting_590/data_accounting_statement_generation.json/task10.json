                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to calculate the initial and final values of non-current assets (property, plant, and equipment) based on the provided transactions data. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Initial Non-current Assets\nFrom the transactions data, the initial non-current assets are recorded under the \"Fixed Assets\" type with the ID \"Initial20231231001\". The amount is clearly stated as 5,000,000.00.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Changes to Non-current Assets\nThe only transaction that affects the non-current assets is the depreciation entry. Depreciation reduces the value of non-current assets over time. \n\nFrom the data:\n- There are two depreciation entries:\n  - \"Depreciation20240101001\" with an amount of 45,747.38\n  - \"Depreciation20240201002\" with an amount of 45,744.93\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Final Non-current Assets\nThe final value of non-current assets is the initial value minus the total depreciation recorded during the period.\n\n- Initial value: 5,000,000.00\n- Total depreciation: 45,747.38 (Jan) + 45,744.93 (Feb) = 91,492.31\n- Final value: 5,000,000.00 - 91,492.31 = 4,908,507.69\n\n### Step 4: Prepare the Solution\nThe initial and final values of non-current assets are:\n- Initial: 5,000,000.00\n- Final: 4,908,507.69\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '4908507.69'}}\n```",
