This is because taxes on unpaid sales would not yet have been paid and thus would not affect the cash flow statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Transactions**: We need to look at all sales transactions (`type = \"Sale\"`) where `payment/receipt_status = \"Paid\"`.\n\n2. **Extract Tax Amounts**: For each of these transactions, extract the `tax_amount` field.\n\n3. **Sum the Tax Amounts**: Sum all the tax amounts from these transactions to get the total tax payable that affects cash flow.\n\n### Relevant Transactions and Tax Amounts:\n\nFrom the provided data, the following sales transactions are marked as \"Paid\":\n\n1. `Sale20240108010`: tax_amount = 14296.14\n2. `Sale20240111017`: tax_amount = 9660.20\n3. `Sale20240127036`: tax_amount = 110.18\n4. `Sale20240131045`: tax_amount = 112.79\n5. `Sale20240204049`: tax_amount = 594.84\n\n### Calculation:\n\nTotal Tax Payable = 14296.14 + 9660.20 + 110.18 + 112.79 + 594.84 = 24774.15\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '24774.15'}}\n```",
