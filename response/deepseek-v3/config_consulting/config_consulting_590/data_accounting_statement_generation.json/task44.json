However, the initial example provided a transaction with `type` \"Fixed Assets\" and an amount of 5,000,000.0, but this was not included in the final calculation in the example solution. Instead, the example solution used a transaction labeled \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" with an amount of 305,354.43.\n\n2. **Analyze the Given Problem**:\n   - In the problem to solve, there is no transaction explicitly labeled \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar. \n   - The closest transaction is the one with `type` \"Fixed Assets\" and `amount` 5,000,000.0, but this seems to be an initial entry rather than a purchase during the period.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are no transactions indicating the purchase of fixed assets during the period (all fixed asset entries seem to be initial balances), the purchase of fixed assets for the cash flow statement would be 0.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '0'} }\n```",
