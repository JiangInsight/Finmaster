                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio** based on the provided financial statements. \n\n### Understanding the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\nFirst, what is the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio? From what I understand, it's a measure of a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nBut sometimes, \"Total Debt\" can be interpreted as \"Total Liabilities.\" I need to check which one is appropriate here.\n\nLooking at the example provided:\n\nIn the example:\n- Operating Cash Flow (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) = -7,259,994.10\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,861,550.92\n- There's no long-term debt mentioned, so Total Debt might just be Total Current Liabilities.\n  \nThe solution given is -3.90, which is -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.90.\n\nSo, it seems that in this context, \"Total Debt\" refers to \"Total Current Liabilities.\"\n\n### Applying This to the New Problem\n\nNow, let's look at the new problem's financial statements.\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,510,837.08\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 3,376,304.04\n\nThere's no mention of long-term liabilities, so we'll assume Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nNow, plug the numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Total Debt}} = \\frac{-4,510,837.08}{3,376,304.04} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n- 4,510,837.08 ÷ 3,376,304.04 ≈ 1.336 (just the absolute value)\n- Since the numerator is negative, the ratio is negative.\n\nSo, ≈ -1.336\n\nBut the example had a ratio rounded to two decimal places, so let's do the same:\n\n- -1.336 → -1.34\n\nWait, but the example was -3.90, which seems to be more precise. Maybe it's not rounded to two decimal places but just as it comes out.\n\nCalculating more precisely:\n\n- 4,510,837.08 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ 1.3359999...\n- So, ≈ -1.336\n\nBut the example had -3.90, which is -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.8999..., so they took two decimal places.\n\nSo, -1.336 → -1.34\n\nBut looking at the numbers, maybe it's better to keep more precision.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is expressed as a percentage or something, but the example is -3.90, which is just the division result.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with -1.34.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculation:\n\n4,510,837.08 ÷ 3,376,304.04:\n\n- 3,376,304.04 × 1 = 3,376,304.04\n- Subtract from 4,510,837.08: 1,134,533.04\n- 3,376,304.04 × 0.3 = 1,012,891.212\n- Subtract: 121,641.828\n- 3,376,304.04 × 0.03 = 101,289.1212\n- Subtract: 20,352.7068\n- 3,376,304.04 × 0.006 ≈ 20,257.82424\n- Subtract: ≈ 94.88256\n\nSo, 1 + 0.3 + 0.03 + 0.006 ≈ 1.336\n\nSo, -1.336 is correct.\n\nRounding to two decimal places: -1.34\n\nBut the example had -3.90, which seems to be the exact division without rounding, so maybe it's better to keep more decimals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's standard to two decimal places.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with -1.34.\n\nBut looking at the numbers, the exact value is -4,510,837.08 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ -1.335999..., so -1.336.\n\nExpressed as in the example: -3.90 is two decimal places, so -1.34.\n\nBut the example might have been calculated differently.\n\nWait, in the example:\n\nOperating Cash Flow: -7,259,994.10\nTotal Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\nRatio: -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.8999..., presented as -3.90\n\nSimilarly here:\n\n-4,510,837.08 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ -1.336\n\nSo, presented as -1.34.\n\nBut the example's -3.90 seems to be truncating after two decimal places without rounding, because -3.899... is shown as -3.90.\n\nSimilarly, -1.335... would be -1.33 if truncating, -1.34 if rounding.\n\nGiven that, I think it's rounded to two decimal places, so -1.34.\n\nBut to match the example's presentation, maybe it's better to show two decimal places even if it's .00, so -1.34.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's showing the full calculation without rounding, like -3.90 in the example is the exact division.\n\nGiven that, I'll present it as -1.34.\n\nBut let me see if there's another interpretation.\n\nIs Total Debt only Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable, or all current liabilities?\n\nIn the example, Total Current Liabilities is Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable, so same as here.\n\nSo, seems correct.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nOperating Cash Flow: -4,510,837.08\nTotal Debt (Total Current Liabilities): 3,376,304.04\n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -4,510,837.08 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ -1.336\n\nPresented as in the example: -1.34\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nIn the example:\nOperating Cash Flow: -7,259,994.10\nTotal Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\nRatio: -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.8999... → -3.90\n\nSimilarly here: -1.336 → -1.34\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully going through the calculations and comparing with the provided example, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-1.34**.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.34'}}\n```",
