                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial task step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio.\n\n### 1. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:**\nGross Profit Margin is a profitability ratio that shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n**From the Income Statement:**\n- Gross Profit = 308,309.79\n- Total Revenue = 851,679.79\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{308,309.79}{851,679.79} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{308,309.79}{851,679.79} \\approx 0.362 \\]\n\\[ 0.362 \\times 100 = 36.2\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **36.20%**.\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio measures a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,510,837.08 (negative value)\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\nTotal Debt isn't directly listed, but we can infer it from the liabilities. The balance sheet shows:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,376,304.04\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Debt ≈ Total Current Liabilities = 3,376,304.04\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-4,510,837.08}{3,376,304.04} \\]\n\nLet's compute this:\n\\[ \\frac{-4,510,837.08}{3,376,304.04} \\approx -1.336 \\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-1.34**.\n\n**Note:** A negative ratio indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative, meaning it's not generating enough cash from operations to cover its debts, which is a concerning sign.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining both calculations:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '36.20%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.34'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Gross Profit Margin:**\n- Gross Profit = 308,309.79\n- Revenue = 851,679.79\n- 308,309.79 / 851,679.79 ≈ 0.362 → 36.2% ✔\n\n**Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:**\n- Operating Cash Flow = -4,510,837.08\n- Total Debt (Current Liabilities) = 3,376,304.04\n- -4,510,837.08 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ -1.336 ≈ -1.34 ✔\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Additional Observations\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin (36.20%):** This is relatively high, indicating that the company retains a good portion of revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This is a positive sign for profitability at the gross level.\n  \n- **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio (-1.34):** The negative value is alarming. It suggests that the company's operations are not generating sufficient cash to cover its current liabilities. This could be due to significant investments in inventory (as seen by the large increase in inventory in the balance sheet) or other operational inefficiencies. The company might be relying on other sources of funding to meet its obligations, which isn't sustainable in the long term.\n\nThese two ratios together paint a picture of a company that is profitable at the gross level but is struggling with cash flow management, possibly due to heavy investment in inventory or other operational expenses.",
