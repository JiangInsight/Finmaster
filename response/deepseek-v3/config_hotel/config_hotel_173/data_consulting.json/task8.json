                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio based on the given cash flow statement. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is. From what I gather, this ratio compares the cash generated from operating activities to the net income of the company. It's a measure of how well a company can turn its profits into cash.\n\nThe formula seems to be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\n### Identifying the Given Values\n\nLooking at the provided data:\n\n- **Net Profit**: 143,922.03\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -4,510,837.08\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-4,510,837.08}{143,922.03} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\nFirst, divide the absolute values:\n\n4,510,837.08 ÷ 143,922.03 ≈ 31.34\n\nNow, since one is negative and the other is positive, the result is negative:\n\nRatio ≈ -31.34\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the ratio was positive (4.41) even though both numbers were negative. Maybe the sign doesn't matter, or we take the absolute value. \n\nWait, in the example:\n\nNet Profit: -1,645,141.43\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,259,994.10\n\nRatio: 4.41\n\nCalculating:\n\n7,259,994.10 ÷ 1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41\n\nSo, it seems we take the absolute values of both numbers and divide them, ignoring the signs.\n\nApplying that to our problem:\n\nAbsolute Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: 4,510,837.08\n\nAbsolute Net Profit: 143,922.03\n\nRatio = 4,510,837.08 / 143,922.03 ≈ 31.34\n\nBut the example had a ratio of 4.41, which is much smaller. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the example, the ratio was the operating cash flow (which is the sum of adjustments to net profit) divided by net profit, not the net cash flow from operating activities.\n\nLooking back:\n\nOperating Cash Flow is typically the cash generated from core operations, which is Net Profit + Non-cash expenses + Changes in working capital.\n\nIn the example, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is given as -7,259,994.10, which seems to be the sum of all operating activities.\n\nBut the ratio is calculated as Operating Cash Flow / Net Income.\n\nIs Operating Cash Flow the same as Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities? Maybe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Operating Cash Flow is Net Profit + Depreciation + Changes in working capital, excluding some items.\n\nBut in the example, the ratio is 4.41, which is -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, it's -4,510,837.08 / 143,922.03 ≈ -31.34, but taking absolute values gives 31.34.\n\nBut the example didn't take absolute values, it just divided the two negatives to get a positive.\n\nSo, maybe the ratio is simply Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit, keeping the signs.\n\nThus, -4,510,837.08 / 143,922.03 ≈ -31.34.\n\nBut the example had both numbers negative, resulting in positive. Here, one is negative, one is positive, so negative ratio.\n\nIs a negative ratio acceptable? Maybe, it indicates that operating cash flow is negative while net income is positive, which could happen if there are large increases in working capital (like inventory or receivables).\n\nGiven that, the ratio is -31.34.\n\nBut the example's answer was {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '4.41'}, just the number without sign, but their calculation preserved the sign implicitly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we report the absolute value.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the most straightforward is to divide the two numbers as is, keeping the sign.\n\nSo, -4,510,837.08 / 143,922.03 ≈ -31.34.\n\nBut the example's answer was positive, so maybe we take absolute values.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with the absolute value: 31.34.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter considering the example and the calculations, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is approximately 31.34 (absolute value).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '31.34'} }\n```",
