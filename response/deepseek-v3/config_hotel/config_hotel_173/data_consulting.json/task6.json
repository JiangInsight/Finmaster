                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Net Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Net Profit Margin\nFirst, I recall that the Net Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows what percentage of a company's revenue is actual profit after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted. The formula for Net Profit Margin is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nThis will give us a percentage that represents how much of each dollar earned by the company is profit.\n\n### Identifying the Given Values\nFrom the provided income statement, I can see:\n\n- **Total Revenue**: 851,679.79\n- **Net Profit**: 143,922.03\n\nThese are the two key numbers I need for the calculation.\n\n### Calculating the Net Profit Margin\nNow, plugging these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{143,922.03}{851,679.79} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide Net Profit by Total Revenue:\n\n\\[ \\frac{143,922.03}{851,679.79} \\approx 0.16896 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.16896 \\times 100 \\approx 16.896\\% \\]\n\n### Rounding the Percentage\nLooking at the example provided, the Net Profit Margin was rounded to two decimal places. So, I'll do the same here:\n\n\\[ 16.896\\% \\approx 16.90\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nJust to ensure I didn't make a mistake, let's quickly verify:\n\n- 16.90% of 851,679.79 is approximately:\n  \n  \\[ 851,679.79 \\times 0.1690 \\approx 143,933.88 \\]\n\nOur Net Profit is 143,922.03, which is very close (the slight difference is due to rounding). So, the calculation seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the Net Profit Margin is approximately 16.90%.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '16.90%'} }\n```",
