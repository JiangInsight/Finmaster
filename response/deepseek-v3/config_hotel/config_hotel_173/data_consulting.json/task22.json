                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios: the Quick Ratio and the Net Profit Margin. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Quick Ratio (also known as the Acid-Test Ratio):**\n   - This ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n   - Formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n     \\]\n   - **Quick Assets** typically include:\n     - Cash and cash equivalents\n     - Marketable securities\n     - Accounts receivable\n     - (They exclude inventory and prepaid expenses because they're less liquid)\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - This ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue.\n   - Formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n     \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the provided financial statements, let's extract the necessary information.\n\n#### Balance Sheet (End of Period - 2024-02-04):\n\n- **Current Assets:**\n  - Cash on Hand: 1,254,762.92\n  - Bank Deposits: 1,982,606.98\n  - Interest Receivable: 7,775.44\n  - Accounts Receivable: 335,967.05\n  - Inventory: 7,783,800.00\n  - Total Current Assets: 11,364,912.39\n\n- **Current Liabilities:**\n  - Accounts Payable: 3,333,720.00\n  - Taxes Payable: 42,584.04\n  - Total Current Liabilities: 3,376,304.04\n\n#### Income Statement:\n\n- Total Revenue: 851,679.79\n- Net Profit: 143,922.03\n\n### Calculating Quick Ratio\n\n**Step 1: Identify Quick Assets**\nQuick assets are the most liquid current assets, excluding inventory. From the balance sheet:\n\n- Cash on Hand: 1,254,762.92\n- Bank Deposits: 1,982,606.98\n- Interest Receivable: 7,775.44\n- Accounts Receivable: 335,967.05\n\nTotal Quick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 1,254,762.92 + 1,982,606.98 + 7,775.44 + 335,967.05\n= ?\n\nLet's add them up:\n\n1,254,762.92\n+1,982,606.98\n= 3,237,369.90\n\n+ 7,775.44\n= 3,245,145.34\n\n+ 335,967.05\n= 3,581,112.39\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that addition because the total seems a bit low compared to the total current assets.\n\nWait, actually, the total current assets are 11,364,912.39, and inventory is 7,783,800.00, so quick assets should be:\n\nTotal Current Assets - Inventory = 11,364,912.39 - 7,783,800.00 = 3,581,112.39\n\nWhich matches our addition above. So, Quick Assets = 3,581,112.39\n\n**Step 2: Identify Current Liabilities**\nTotal Current Liabilities = 3,376,304.04\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Quick Ratio**\nQuick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities\n= 3,581,112.39 / 3,376,304.04\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n3,581,112.39 ÷ 3,376,304.04 ≈ 1.0606\n\nSo, approximately 1.06\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the quick ratio was given to two decimal places, so we'll round to two decimal places: 1.06\n\nWait, but in the example, it was 1.54, which is higher. Maybe I missed something in quick assets.\n\nWait, is Interest Receivable considered a quick asset? I think it is, as it's expected to be received in the short term. Similarly, Accounts Receivable is definitely a quick asset.\n\nInventory is excluded, which is correct.\n\nSo, our calculation seems correct: 3,581,112.39 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ 1.06\n\nMaybe the example had higher quick assets relative to liabilities.\n\nSo, Quick Ratio = 1.06\n\n### Calculating Net Profit Margin\n\n**Step 1: Identify Net Profit and Total Revenue**\nFrom the income statement:\n\n- Net Profit: 143,922.03\n- Total Revenue: 851,679.79\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Net Profit Margin**\nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100%\n= (143,922.03 / 851,679.79) * 100%\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\n143,922.03 ÷ 851,679.79 ≈ 0.16896\n\nThen multiply by 100%:\n\n0.16896 * 100 ≈ 16.896%\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 16.90%\n\nBut in the example, it was negative because net profit was negative. Here, it's positive.\n\nSo, Net Profit Margin = 16.90%\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '1.06', 'Net Profit Margin': '16.90%'} }\n```\n\nWait a second, let me cross-validate the quick assets. Maybe bank deposits are already part of cash and cash equivalents, and we shouldn't double-count.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet:\n\n- Cash on Hand\n- Bank Deposits\nThese are both liquid, so both should be included in quick assets.\n\nInterest Receivable and Accounts Receivable are also quick assets.\n\nInventory is excluded.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, net profit margin calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '1.06', 'Net Profit Margin': '16.90%'} }\n```",
