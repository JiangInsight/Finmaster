                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Current Ratio and the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: This measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its current assets. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: This shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n   \\]\n   Since we only have the ending inventory (no beginning inventory other than zero), we'll use the ending inventory as the average inventory for this calculation.\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n\n- **Total Current Assets**: 11,364,912.39 (as of 2024-02-04)\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 3,376,304.04 (as of 2024-02-04)\n- **Inventory**: 7,783,800.00 (as of 2024-02-04)\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 543,370.00\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{11,364,912.39}{3,376,304.04}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{11,364,912.39}{3,376,304.04} \\approx 3.366\n\\]\n\nSo, the Current Ratio is approximately **3.37**.\n\n### Calculating the Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\nSince the beginning inventory is 0 (as per the initial amount on 2023-12-31), and the ending inventory is 7,783,800.00, the average inventory is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{0 + 7,783,800.00}{2} = 3,891,900.00\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} = \\frac{543,370.00}{3,891,900.00}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{543,370.00}{3,891,900.00} \\approx 0.1396\n\\]\n\nSo, the Inventory Turnover Ratio is approximately **0.14**.\n\nHowever, this seems quite low, which might indicate that the inventory is not turning over quickly. But let's double-check if we're interpreting the inventory correctly.\n\nLooking back at the balance sheet, the initial inventory is 0, and the end inventory is 7,783,800.00. If we assume that the inventory was purchased during the period and not sold much, leading to a high ending inventory, then the low turnover makes sense given the COGS is relatively small compared to the average inventory.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the initial inventory is not zero (maybe it's missing), but based on the given data, we have to proceed with what's provided.\n\nGiven that, the calculations seem correct based on the data.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '3.37', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.14'} }\n```\n\n**Wait a minute**, looking back at the example provided, the Inventory Turnover Ratio was calculated differently. Maybe they used only the ending inventory instead of average inventory, especially since the beginning was zero.\n\nIf we use only ending inventory:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Ending Inventory}} = \\frac{543,370.00}{7,783,800.00} \\approx 0.07\n\\]\n\nThis is even lower. Maybe there's a mistake in interpreting the inventory data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"initial_amount\" for inventory is not zero, but the table shows it as zero. Maybe the initial inventory is part of \"Total Current Assets\" initial amount, but not separately listed.\n\nGiven that, it's possible that the initial inventory is not zero, but the table shows zero, which might be incorrect. Maybe the inventory was not present initially, and all was purchased during the period.\n\nIn that case, using ending inventory as the average might not be appropriate, and perhaps the ratio is intended to be calculated based on ending inventory only for this period.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and following the example where they likely used ending inventory (since beginning was zero), let's stick with:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Ending Inventory}} = \\frac{543,370.00}{7,783,800.00} \\approx 0.07\n\\]\n\nBut the example had a higher ratio, suggesting they might have used average even with zero beginning, which would be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{543,370.00}{3,891,900.00} \\approx 0.14\n\\]\n\nGiven that, and since the example used a similar approach, let's go with 0.14.\n\nHowever, looking at the example again:\n\nTheir COGS was 4,410,000.00 and Inventory was 5,090,000.00 (end), beginning was 0.\n\nTheir Inventory Turnover was 1.73, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4,410,000.00}{5,090,000.00} \\approx 0.87\n\\]\n\nBut they got 1.73, which is double, meaning they used average inventory:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4,410,000.00}{2,545,000.00} \\approx 1.73\n\\]\n\nSo they did (beginning + end)/2, even if beginning was zero.\n\nSo for our case:\n\nAverage inventory = (0 + 7,783,800.00)/2 = 3,891,900.00\n\nInventory Turnover = 543,370.00 / 3,891,900.00 ≈ 0.14\n\nBut their COGS was much higher relative to inventory, leading to a higher ratio. In our case, COGS is much smaller relative to inventory, leading to a low ratio.\n\nSo the correct Inventory Turnover is 0.14.\n\nBut their example had beginning inventory as zero, and they still used average, so we'll do the same.\n\nThus, final ratios:\n\nCurrent Ratio: 3.37\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio: 0.14\n\nBut let's check Current Ratio calculation again for precision:\n\n11,364,912.39 / 3,376,304.04 = ?\n\nCalculating:\n\n11,364,912.39 ÷ 3,376,304.04 ≈ 3.366\n\nSo, 3.37 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, Inventory Turnover:\n\n543,370 / 3,891,900 ≈ 0.1396 ≈ 0.14\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '3.37', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.14'} }\n```",
