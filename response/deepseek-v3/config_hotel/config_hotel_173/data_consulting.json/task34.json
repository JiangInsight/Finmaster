                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand each component before plugging in the numbers.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,510,837.08\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,376,304.04\n\n**Calculation:**  \n-4,510,837.08 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ -1.34\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3,376,304.04 (since there's no long-term debt mentioned)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,143,922.03\n\n**Calculation:**  \n3,376,304.04 / 16,143,922.03 ≈ 0.21\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 851,679.79\n\nAverage Total Assets = (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2  \nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Total Assets = 16,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets = 19,520,226.07\n\nAverage Total Assets = (16,000,000 + 19,520,226.07) / 2 = 17,760,113.035\n\n**Calculation:**  \n851,679.79 / 17,760,113.035 ≈ 0.048\n\nHmm, this seems quite low compared to the example. Maybe I should double-check if \"Main Business Revenue\" is the same as \"Net Sales.\" In the example, \"Main Business Revenue\" was used as \"Total Revenue,\" so it seems correct.\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 11,364,912.39\n- Inventory = 7,783,800.00\n- Current Liabilities = 3,376,304.04\n\n**Calculation:**  \n(11,364,912.39 - 7,783,800.00) / 3,376,304.04 = 3,581,112.39 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ 1.06\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nThis seems identical to the first ratio. In the example provided, both ratios had the same value. So:\n\n-4,510,837.08 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ -1.34\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Income / Average Shareholder's Equity\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = 143,922.03\n\nAverage Equity = (Beginning Equity + Ending Equity) / 2  \nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Equity = 16,000,000.00\n- Ending Equity = 16,143,922.03\n\nAverage Equity = (16,000,000 + 16,143,922.03) / 2 = 16,071,961.015\n\n**Calculation:**  \n143,922.03 / 16,071,961.015 ≈ 0.00895 or 0.895%\n\nExpressed as a percentage: ≈ 0.90%\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since we don't have info on cash vs. credit):\n- Net Sales = 851,679.79\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2  \nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning AR = 0.00\n- Ending AR = 335,967.05\n\nAverage AR = (0 + 335,967.05) / 2 = 167,983.525\n\n**Calculation:**  \n851,679.79 / 167,983.525 ≈ 5.07\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.34', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.05', 'Quick Ratio': '1.06', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.34', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.90%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '5.07'}}\n```\n\n**Reviewing the Calculations:**\n- **Total Asset Turnover Ratio:** Initially seemed low, but given the small revenue relative to large assets, it might be correct.\n- **Quick Ratio:** Makes sense as it's slightly above 1, indicating the company can cover current liabilities without selling inventory.\n- **ROE:** Low, but the net income is small compared to the equity.\n- **Accounts Receivable Turnover:** Seems reasonable given the numbers.\n\nEverything checks out based on the provided data.",
