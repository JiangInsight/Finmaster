However, in the given data, the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" already represents the capital expenditures (since it's the purchase of fixed assets). Therefore, FCF can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{FCF} = \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} + \\text{Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities}\n   \\]\n   Alternatively, since the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents is the sum of operating and investing activities, we can also use that directly as FCF.\n\nGiven the data:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -4,510,837.08\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -251,793.02\n- Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents: -4,762,630.10\n\nCalculating FCF:\n\\[\n\\text{FCF} = -4,510,837.08 + (-251,793.02) = -4,762,630.10\n\\]\n\nThis matches the \"Net Increase\" value provided in the problem, which is the correct FCF.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-4762630.10'} }\n```",
