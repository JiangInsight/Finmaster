I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Equity Ratio\nFirst, what is the Debt to Equity Ratio? From what I understand, it's a financial metric that compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholders' equity. It's used to assess a company's financial leverage and is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\n### Identifying the Components in the Balance Sheet\nNow, looking at the provided balance sheet, I need to identify:\n1. **Total Liabilities**: This seems to be the sum of all the company's debts or obligations.\n2. **Total Shareholders' Equity**: This is the owners' claim after all liabilities have been paid.\n\nFrom the table:\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: At the end date (2024-02-04), this is 3,376,304.04.\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed in this balance sheet, so total liabilities are just the total current liabilities.\n- **Total Owner's Equity**: At the end date, this is 16,143,922.03.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\nNow, plugging these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{3,376,304.04}{16,143,922.03} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3,376,304.04}{16,143,922.03} \\approx 0.2091 \\]\n\nRounding this to two decimal places gives approximately 0.21.\n\n### Verifying the Components\nJust to make sure I didn't miss anything:\n- **Total Liabilities**: Only \"Total Current Liabilities\" is given as 3,376,304.04. No other liabilities are listed, so this seems correct.\n- **Total Equity**: \"Total Owner's Equity\" is clearly stated as 16,143,922.03.\n\n### Final Answer\nSo, the Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.21.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21'} }\n```",
