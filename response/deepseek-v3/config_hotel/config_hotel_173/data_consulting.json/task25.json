                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. We have three financial statements: the balance sheet, the cash flow statement, and the income statement. We need to calculate three ratios:\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio**\n2. **Net Profit Margin**\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio**\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the financial leverage of a company by comparing its total liabilities to its shareholders' equity.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 3,376,304.04\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so **Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3,376,304.04**\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 16,143,922.03\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{3,376,304.04}{16,143,922.03} \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{3,376,304.04}{16,143,922.03} \\approx 0.2091 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately **0.21**.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** 143,922.03\n- **Total Revenue:** 851,679.79\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{143,922.03}{851,679.79} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's calculate:\n\\[ \\frac{143,922.03}{851,679.79} \\approx 0.169 \\]\n\\[ 0.169 \\times 100 = 16.9\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is approximately **16.90%**.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -4,510,837.08\n- From the balance sheet:\n  - **Total Current Liabilities:** 3,376,304.04\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-4,510,837.08}{3,376,304.04} \\]\n\nLet's compute:\n\\[ \\frac{-4,510,837.08}{3,376,304.04} \\approx -1.336 \\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio is approximately **-1.34**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21', 'Net Profit Margin': '16.90%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.34'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - Liabilities: 3,376,304.04\n   - Equity: 16,143,922.03\n   - 3,376,304.04 / 16,143,922.03 ≈ 0.21 ✔\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - Net Profit: 143,922.03\n   - Revenue: 851,679.79\n   - (143,922.03 / 851,679.79) * 100 ≈ 16.90% ✔\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -4,510,837.08\n   - Current Liabilities: 3,376,304.04\n   - -4,510,837.08 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ -1.34 ✔\n\nEverything checks out!",
