                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate two ratios: the Debt to Asset Ratio and the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities listed) = 3,376,304.04\n- Total Assets = 19,520,226.07\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{3,376,304.04}{19,520,226.07} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n3,376,304.04 ÷ 19,520,226.07 ≈ 0.1729\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.17\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the ratio was given as '0.14', which is a decimal rounded to two places. So, similarly, we'll present our answer as '0.17'.\n\nWait a minute, is \"Total Current Liabilities\" the same as \"Total Liabilities\" here? In the given balance sheet, it seems that \"Total Current Liabilities\" is the only liability listed, and there's no separate \"Total Liabilities\" line. So, we'll assume that Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3,376,304.04.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operations to the net income, indicating how much cash is generated per dollar of net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit (Net Income)}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,510,837.08\n- Net Profit = 143,922.03\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-4,510,837.08}{143,922.03} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n-4,510,837.08 ÷ 143,922.03 ≈ -31.34\n\nThis gives us approximately -31.34.\n\nBut in the example provided, the ratio was positive (4.41), even though the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities was negative (-7,259,994.10) and Net Profit was negative (-1,645,141.43), resulting in a positive ratio (since negative divided by negative is positive).\n\nIn our case, Net Cash Flow is negative, and Net Profit is positive, so the ratio is negative. \n\nIs this correct? Let me think:\n\nIn the example:\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -7,259,994.10\nNet Profit = -1,645,141.43\nRatio = -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 = 4.41 (positive)\n\nIn our problem:\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,510,837.08\nNet Profit = 143,922.03\nRatio = -4,510,837.08 / 143,922.03 = -31.34\n\nThis seems correct based on the numbers. Maybe the negative sign is acceptable here since the cash flow is negative while net income is positive.\n\nBut is this ratio usually presented as an absolute value? Maybe, but based on the calculation, it's negative here.\n\nAlternatively, is there a possibility that the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is supposed to be positive? Looking at the cash flow statement, it's clearly negative (-4,510,837.08). \n\nGiven that, the ratio is indeed negative.\n\nHowever, in financial analysis, sometimes ratios can be negative, indicating that operating cash flow is in the opposite direction of net income. \n\nGiven that, we'll present it as '-31.34'.\n\nBut looking back at the example, the ratio was given as '4.41', which is a positive number despite both numerator and denominator being negative. Maybe the ratio is always presented as an absolute value?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is calculated differently. Let me check the components:\n\nIn the example:\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities is the sum of:\nNet Profit + Depreciation + Changes in Working Capital etc. = -7,259,994.10\n\nBut in our case, the sum is -4,510,837.08.\n\nAlternatively, is there another line for \"Operating Cash Flow\"? \n\nLooking at the cash flow statement, \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" seems to be the correct line to use, which is -4,510,837.08.\n\nGiven that, the ratio is -31.34.\n\nPerhaps the negative sign is acceptable here.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.17', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-31.34'}}\n```\n\nHowever, considering that in the example, both net income and operating cash flow were negative, resulting in a positive ratio, and in our case, one is negative and the other positive, resulting in a negative ratio, this seems mathematically correct. \n\nBut is it possible that the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is supposed to be the absolute value? Maybe, but based on the calculation, it's negative here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in interpreting which number to take for operating cash flow. \n\nLooking back at the cash flow statement, \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" is indeed -4,510,837.08, and \"Net Profit\" is 143,922.03, so the ratio is -31.34.\n\nUnless there's another line for operating cash flow, but it seems not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.17', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-31.34'}}\n```\n\nBut let me double-check the calculation for the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,510,837.08\nNet Profit = 143,922.03\n\nRatio = -4,510,837.08 / 143,922.03 = -31.34\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, Debt to Asset Ratio:\n\nTotal Liabilities = 3,376,304.04\nTotal Assets = 19,520,226.07\n\nRatio = 3,376,304.04 / 19,520,226.07 ≈ 0.1729 ≈ 0.17\n\nSo, final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.17', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-31.34'}}\n```",
