                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one using the provided financial statements. I'll go through each ratio, explain what it means, and then calculate it step by step.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow from its operating activities. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,510,837.08\nFrom the balance sheet (End_date 2024-02-04):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,376,304.04\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-4,510,837.08}{3,376,304.04} \\approx -1.34 \\]\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 3,376,304.04\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-4,510,837.08}{3,376,304.04} \\approx -1.34 \\]\n\n*Note: In this case, since there are no long-term liabilities, this ratio is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio.*\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 543,370.00\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00 (Initial_date 2023-12-31)\n- Ending Inventory = 7,783,800.00 (End_date 2024-02-04)\n\nAverage Inventory:\n\\[ \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{0 + 7,783,800}{2} = 3,891,900 \\]\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{543,370}{3,891,900} \\approx 0.14 \\]\n\n*Wait a minute, this seems very low. Maybe I should consider that the initial inventory is zero, and all inventory was purchased during the period. Alternatively, if the company started with zero inventory and ended with 7,783,800, perhaps the average is not the best measure here. Maybe using ending inventory is more appropriate in this context.*\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the ratio is calculated using ending inventory only:\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Ending Inventory}} = \\frac{543,370}{7,783,800} \\approx 0.07 \\]\n\nThis still seems very low. Maybe there's a mistake in interpreting the inventory data. Given that the initial inventory is zero, and the ending is 7,783,800, and COGS is 543,370, it implies that only a small portion of the inventory was sold, which might be correct given the data.\n\nBut looking back at the example provided, their Inventory Turnover was 1.73 with COGS of 4,410,000 and ending inventory of 5,090,000, which is:\n\\[ \\frac{4,410,000}{5,090,000} \\approx 0.87 \\]\nBut their solution was 1.73, which suggests they might be using COGS / Average Inventory where average is (0 + 5,090,000)/2 = 2,545,000:\n\\[ \\frac{4,410,000}{2,545,000} \\approx 1.73 \\]\n\nSo, applying the same method:\nAverage Inventory = (0 + 7,783,800)/2 = 3,891,900\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{543,370}{3,891,900} \\approx 0.14 \\]\n\nThis seems correct based on the method used in the example, even though the number is low.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholder equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3,376,304.04\n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,143,922.03\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{3,376,304.04}{16,143,922.03} \\approx 0.21 \\]\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 1,254,762.92\n- Bank Deposits = 1,982,606.98\n- Interest Receivable = 7,775.44\n- Accounts Receivable = 335,967.05\n- Total Quick Assets = 1,254,762.92 + 1,982,606.98 + 7,775.44 + 335,967.05 = 3,581,112.39\n- Current Liabilities = 3,376,304.04\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{3,581,112.39}{3,376,304.04} \\approx 1.06 \\]\n\n*Wait, in the example, they included Interest Receivable in quick assets. So, I'll keep it as is.*\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its current assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 11,364,912.39\n- Current Liabilities = 3,376,304.04\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{11,364,912.39}{3,376,304.04} \\approx 3.37 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the summarized solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.34', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.34', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.14', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21', 'Quick Ratio': '1.06', 'Current Ratio': '3.37'}}\n```\n\n*Double-checking the Inventory Turnover Ratio:*\nGiven that initial inventory is zero and ending is 7,783,800, and COGS is 543,370, the average inventory is 3,891,900, leading to 0.14. This seems correct based on the method used in the example, even though it's low, indicating very slow inventory turnover.\n\nAll other calculations seem correct based on the provided data and the methods used in the example.",
