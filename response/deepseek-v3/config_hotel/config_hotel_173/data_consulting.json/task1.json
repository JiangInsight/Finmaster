                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Current Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Current Ratio\nFirst, I recall that the **Current Ratio** is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations or those due within one year. The formula for the Current Ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nSo, to find the Current Ratio, I need two pieces of information from the balance sheet:\n1. **Total Current Assets**\n2. **Total Current Liabilities**\n\n### Identifying the Relevant Data\nLooking at the provided balance sheet, I can see the following entries:\n\n**Current Assets:**\n- Cash on Hand: 1,254,762.92\n- Bank Deposits: 1,982,606.98\n- Interest Receivable: 7,775.44\n- Accounts Receivable: 335,967.05\n- Inventory: 7,783,800.00\n- **Total Current Assets**: 11,364,912.39\n\n**Current Liabilities:**\n- Accounts Payable: 3,333,720.00\n- Taxes Payable: 42,584.04\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 3,376,304.04\n\n### Verifying the Totals\nBefore proceeding, I should verify that the totals provided match the sum of their components.\n\n**Checking Total Current Assets:**\n\\[ 1,254,762.92 (\\text{Cash}) + 1,982,606.98 (\\text{Bank}) + 7,775.44 (\\text{Interest}) + 335,967.05 (\\text{Receivables}) + 7,783,800.00 (\\text{Inventory}) \\]\nLet's add them step by step:\n1. 1,254,762.92 + 1,982,606.98 = 3,237,369.90\n2. 3,237,369.90 + 7,775.44 = 3,245,145.34\n3. 3,245,145.34 + 335,967.05 = 3,581,112.39\n4. 3,581,112.39 + 7,783,800.00 = 11,364,912.39\n\nThis matches the given **Total Current Assets** of 11,364,912.39. Good.\n\n**Checking Total Current Liabilities:**\n\\[ 3,333,720.00 (\\text{Accounts Payable}) + 42,584.04 (\\text{Taxes Payable}) \\]\nAdding them:\n3,333,720.00 + 42,584.04 = 3,376,304.04\n\nThis matches the given **Total Current Liabilities** of 3,376,304.04. Perfect.\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\nNow, applying the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{11,364,912.39}{3,376,304.04} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\nFirst, let's see how many times 3,376,304.04 fits into 11,364,912.39.\n\n\\[ 3,376,304.04 \\times 3 = 10,128,912.12 \\]\nSubtracting from total current assets:\n11,364,912.39 - 10,128,912.12 = 1,236,000.27\n\nNow, divide the remainder by the current liabilities:\n1,236,000.27 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ 0.366\n\nSo, total:\n3 (from the multiplication) + 0.366 ≈ 3.366\n\nBut let's calculate it more precisely using a calculator for accuracy.\n\nCalculating 11,364,912.39 ÷ 3,376,304.04:\n\nUsing a calculator:\n11,364,912.39 ÷ 3,376,304.04 ≈ 3.366\n\nSo, the Current Ratio is approximately 3.37.\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the Current Ratio was given to two decimal places ('4.27'). So, I'll present my answer similarly.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\\[ \\frac{11,364,912.39}{3,376,304.04} \\approx 3.366 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 3.37\n\nBut let's ensure the division is precise:\n\nPerforming long division:\n\n11,364,912.39 ÷ 3,376,304.04\n\n3,376,304.04 × 3 = 10,128,912.12\nSubtract: 11,364,912.39 - 10,128,912.12 = 1,236,000.27\n\nNow, 3,376,304.04 × 0.366 ≈ 1,235,000 (approximate)\nBut exact calculation:\n\n1,236,000.27 ÷ 3,376,304.04 ≈ 0.366\n\nSo, total is 3.366, which rounds to 3.37.\n\nBut perhaps the exact value is slightly different. Alternatively, maybe the ratio is expected to be more precise.\n\nGiven that, and considering the example had a ratio calculated from the given totals without summing individual items (since the totals were correct), perhaps the ratio is simply:\n\n11,364,912.39 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ 3.366\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 3.37\n\nBut looking at the example, their calculation was:\n\n7,956,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 4.273, rounded to '4.27'\n\nSimilarly, here:\n\n11,364,912.39 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ 3.366, so '3.37'\n\nBut to match the example's precision, maybe it's '3.37'.\n\nHowever, calculating more precisely:\n\n11,364,912.39 ÷ 3,376,304.04 ≈ 3.366\n\nSo, '3.37' seems correct.\n\nBut let's see if the individual components sum exactly to the totals, which they do, so no issue there.\n\n### Potential Missteps\nI initially thought about summing all current assets and liabilities manually, but the totals are already provided and verified. So, using the totals is correct.\n\nAnother thought: is there any other current asset or liability not included? From the table, all current items seem accounted for in the totals.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter careful calculation and verification, the Current Ratio is approximately 3.37.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '3.37'} }\n```",
