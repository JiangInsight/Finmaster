                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Quick Ratio based on the given balance sheet data. \n\n### Understanding the Quick Ratio\nFirst, what is the Quick Ratio? It's a measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**Quick Assets** typically include:\n1. Cash and cash equivalents (like Cash on Hand and Bank Deposits)\n2. Marketable securities (not present here)\n3. Accounts Receivable\n4. Sometimes Interest Receivable is included if it's expected to be received shortly.\n\n**Not included in Quick Assets:**\n- Inventory (because it's not as liquid; it takes time to sell and convert to cash)\n- Prepaid expenses (not present here)\n\n**Current Liabilities** are the obligations the company needs to pay within a year, which in this case are:\n- Accounts Payable\n- Taxes Payable\n- And any other short-term liabilities listed (none here beyond those two).\n\n### Identifying the Relevant Numbers from the Balance Sheet\nLooking at the \"End_amount\" column (since we're calculating as of the end of the reporting period):\n\n**Quick Assets:**\n1. Cash on Hand: 1,254,762.92\n2. Bank Deposits: 1,982,606.98\n3. Interest Receivable: 7,775.44 (I'll include this as it's likely short-term)\n4. Accounts Receivable: 335,967.05\n\n**Inventory:** 7,783,800.00 (This is NOT a quick asset)\n**Total Current Assets:** 11,364,912.39 (This includes all current assets, but we're interested only in quick assets)\n\n**Current Liabilities:**\n1. Accounts Payable: 3,333,720.00\n2. Taxes Payable: 42,584.04\n   - Total Current Liabilities: 3,376,304.04 (which matches the given total)\n\n### Calculating Quick Assets\nAdding up the quick assets:\n- Cash on Hand: 1,254,762.92\n- Bank Deposits: 1,982,606.98\n- Interest Receivable: 7,775.44\n- Accounts Receivable: 335,967.05\n\nTotal Quick Assets = 1,254,762.92 + 1,982,606.98 + 7,775.44 + 335,967.05\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n1. 1,254,762.92 + 1,982,606.98 = 3,237,369.90\n2. 3,237,369.90 + 7,775.44 = 3,245,145.34\n3. 3,245,145.34 + 335,967.05 = 3,581,112.39\n\nSo, Total Quick Assets = 3,581,112.39\n\n### Calculating the Quick Ratio\nNow, divide Quick Assets by Current Liabilities:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{3,581,112.39}{3,376,304.04} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n3,581,112.39 ÷ 3,376,304.04 ≈ 1.0606\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 1.06\n\n### Verifying\nJust to ensure I didn't miss anything:\n- Did I include all quick assets? Yes: cash, bank deposits, interest receivable, accounts receivable.\n- Did I exclude inventory? Yes.\n- Are the current liabilities correct? Yes, summing accounts payable and taxes payable gives the total provided.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe Quick Ratio is approximately 1.06.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '1.06'} }\n```",
