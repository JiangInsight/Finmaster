                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. We have three financial statements: the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement. We need to calculate three ratios:\n\n1. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio**\n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio**\n3. **Quick Ratio**\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,510,837.08\n- Net Profit (from income statement) = 143,922.03\n\nWait a minute, the net cash flow from operating activities is negative, and net profit is positive. Dividing a negative by a positive will give a negative ratio, but in the example provided, the ratio was positive (4.41). Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLooking back at the example:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities was -7,259,994.10\n- Net Profit was -1,645,141.43\n- Ratio was 4.41 (which is -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41)\n\nAh, so both were negative, resulting in a positive ratio. In our current problem, one is negative and one is positive, so the ratio will be negative.\n\nCalculating:\n\\[ \\frac{-4,510,837.08}{143,922.03} \\approx -31.34 \\]\n\nBut this seems unusually large in magnitude compared to the example. Maybe I should check if I'm using the correct figures.\n\nWait, is \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" the correct numerator? In the example, it seems to be the sum of all operating cash flows excluding the net profit. Let me see:\n\nIn the example:\nNet Profit: -1,645,141.43\nDepreciation: +45,751.41\nDecrease in AR: -2,429,482.13\nDecrease in Interest Receivable: -2,672.87\nDecrease in Inventory: -5,090,000.00\nIncrease in AP: +1,590,000.00\nIncrease in Tax Payable: +271,550.92\nSum: -1,645,141.43 + 45,751.41 - 2,429,482.13 - 2,672.87 - 5,090,000.00 + 1,590,000.00 + 271,550.92 = -7,259,994.10 (matches)\n\nSo, the ratio is Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit.\n\nIn our problem:\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -4,510,837.08\nNet Profit: 143,922.03\nRatio: -4,510,837.08 / 143,922.03 ≈ -31.34\n\nThis seems correct based on the given data, even though it's negative.\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Current Assets} + \\text{Ending Current Assets}}{2} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Current Assets (Initial_amount for Total Current Assets) = 8,000,000.00\n- Ending Current Assets (End_amount for Total Current Assets) = 11,364,912.39\n\nAverage Current Assets:\n\\[ \\frac{8,000,000.00 + 11,364,912.39}{2} = \\frac{19,364,912.39}{2} = 9,682,456.195 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 851,679.79\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\\[ \\frac{851,679.79}{9,682,456.195} \\approx 0.088 \\]\n\nThis seems quite low compared to the example's 0.68. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, is \"Total Revenue\" the correct numerator? Yes, in the example, it was \"Main Business Revenue\" which was the same as \"Total Revenue\" (5,431,018.59), and the average current assets were (8,000,000 + 7,956,806.47)/2 ≈ 7,978,403.235, giving 5,431,018.59 / 7,978,403.235 ≈ 0.68.\n\nIn our case, revenue is much lower relative to current assets, so 0.088 seems plausible.\n\n### 3. Quick Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = \\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents} + \\text{Accounts Receivable} + \\text{Marketable Securities} \\]\n(Assuming no marketable securities here)\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand (End_amount) = 1,254,762.92\n- Bank Deposits (End_amount) = 1,982,606.98\n- Accounts Receivable (End_amount) = 335,967.05\n- Interest Receivable (End_amount) = 7,775.44 (usually considered quick asset)\n  \nQuick Assets:\n\\[ 1,254,762.92 (\\text{Cash on Hand}) + 1,982,606.98 (\\text{Bank Deposits}) + 335,967.05 (\\text{AR}) + 7,775.44 (\\text{Interest Receivable}) \\]\n\\[ = 1,254,762.92 + 1,982,606.98 = 3,237,369.90 \\]\n\\[ + 335,967.05 = 3,573,336.95 \\]\n\\[ + 7,775.44 = 3,581,112.39 \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 3,376,304.04\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\\[ \\frac{3,581,112.39}{3,376,304.04} \\approx 1.06 \\]\n\nWait, in the example, quick assets were:\nCash on Hand: 270,005.90\nBank Deposits: 164,645.57\nAccounts Receivable: 2,429,482.13\nInterest Receivable: 2,672.87\nTotal: 270,005.90 + 164,645.57 = 434,651.47\n+ 2,429,482.13 = 2,864,133.60\n+ 2,672.87 = 2,866,806.47\nCurrent Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\nRatio: 2,866,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54\n\nOur calculation seems correct, giving 1.06 here.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating each ratio:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: -31.34\n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio: 0.088\n3. Quick Ratio: 1.06\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-31.34', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.09', 'Quick Ratio': '1.06'} }\n```\n\n*Note: The Current Assets Turnover Ratio is rounded to two decimal places as 0.09 for consistency with the example's presentation.*",
