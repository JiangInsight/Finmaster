                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 11,364,912.39\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 3,376,304.04\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 11,364,912.39 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ 3.37\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 1,254,762.92\n- Bank Deposits = 1,982,606.98\n- Interest Receivable = 7,775.44\n- Accounts Receivable = 335,967.05\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,376,304.04\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 1,254,762.92 + 1,982,606.98 + 7,775.44 + 335,967.05 ≈ 3,581,112.39\n\nQuick Ratio = 3,581,112.39 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ 1.06\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 3,376,304.04\n- Total Assets = 19,520,226.07\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 3,376,304.04 / 19,520,226.07 ≈ 0.17\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 3,376,304.04\n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,143,922.03\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 3,376,304.04 / 16,143,922.03 ≈ 0.21\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,510,837.08\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 3,376,304.04\n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -4,510,837.08 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ -1.34\n\n*Note: A negative ratio here indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative, which isn't covering its debt obligations.*\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '3.37', 'Quick Ratio': '1.06', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.17', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.34'} }\n```\n\n### Verification:\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: 11,364,912.39 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ 3.37 ✔\n2. **Quick Ratio**: (1,254,762.92 + 1,982,606.98 + 7,775.44 + 335,967.05) / 3,376,304.04 ≈ 3,581,112.39 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ 1.06 ✔\n3. **Debt to Asset**: 3,376,304.04 / 19,520,226.07 ≈ 0.17 ✔\n4. **Debt to Equity**: 3,376,304.04 / 16,143,922.03 ≈ 0.21 ✔\n5. **Cash Flow to Debt**: -4,510,837.08 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ -1.34 ✔\n\nEverything checks out!",
