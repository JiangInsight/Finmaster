                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement analysis step by step. We need to calculate three ratios: the Debt to Asset Ratio, the Gross Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. I'll go through each one separately, explaining how to calculate them using the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 3,376,304.04\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3,376,304.04\n- **Total Assets (End_amount):** 19,520,226.07\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{3,376,304.04}{19,520,226.07} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ \\frac{3,376,304.04}{19,520,226.07} \\approx 0.17296 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[ \\approx 0.17 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.17.\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 308,309.79\n- **Total Revenue:** 851,679.79\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{308,309.79}{851,679.79} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFirst, divide:\n\\[ \\frac{308,309.79}{851,679.79} \\approx 0.362 \\]\n\nThen multiply by 100%:\n\\[ 0.362 \\times 100\\% \\approx 36.2\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately 36.20%.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -4,510,837.08 (negative value)\n  \nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 3,376,304.04\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-4,510,837.08}{3,376,304.04} \\]\n\nDivide:\n\\[ \\frac{-4,510,837.08}{3,376,304.04} \\approx -1.336 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[ \\approx -1.34 \\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately -1.34.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.17', 'Gross Profit Margin': '36.20%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.34'}}\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n   - Total Liabilities: 3,376,304.04\n   - Total Assets: 19,520,226.07\n   - 3,376,304.04 / 19,520,226.07 ≈ 0.17 ✔\n\n2. **Gross Profit Margin:**\n   - Gross Profit: 308,309.79\n   - Total Revenue: 851,679.79\n   - 308,309.79 / 851,679.79 ≈ 0.362 → 36.2% ✔\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio:**\n   - Net Operating Cash Flow: -4,510,837.08\n   - Current Liabilities: 3,376,304.04\n   - -4,510,837.08 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ -1.34 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The calculations seem correct based on the provided data.",
