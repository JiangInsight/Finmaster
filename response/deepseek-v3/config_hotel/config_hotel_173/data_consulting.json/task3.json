                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Asset Ratio\nFirst, I need to understand what the Debt to Asset Ratio is. From what I know, it's a financial ratio that measures the extent of a company's leverage. It shows the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. \n\nThe formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nBut sometimes, \"Total Debt\" can be interpreted as \"Total Liabilities.\" In the context of a balance sheet, liabilities are the debts the company owes. So, I think in this case, we can use \"Total Liabilities\" as the numerator.\n\n### Identifying the Components from the Balance Sheet\nLooking at the given balance sheet, I need to identify:\n1. **Total Liabilities**: This is the sum of all the company's debts or obligations.\n2. **Total Assets**: This is the sum of everything the company owns.\n\nFrom the balance sheet provided:\n\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: At the end date (2024-02-04), this is 3,376,304.04.\n- **Total Non-current Liabilities**: Hmm, I don't see a line item for non-current liabilities in the given table. The only liabilities mentioned are under \"Total Current Liabilities.\" Does that mean there are no long-term debts? Maybe the company doesn't have any non-current liabilities, or they're not provided here.\n  \nGiven that, it seems the only liabilities are the current ones: 3,376,304.04.\n\n- **Total Assets**: At the end date, this is 19,520,226.07.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\nNow, plugging these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{3,376,304.04}{19,520,226.07} \\]\n\nLet me do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3,376,304.04}{19,520,226.07} \\approx 0.17296 \\]\n\nRounding this to two decimal places gives approximately 0.17.\n\n### Verifying the Approach\nWait a minute, in the example provided, the solution was {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.14'}. Let me see how they got that.\n\nIn the example:\n- Total Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\n- Total Assets: 13,216,409.49\n- Ratio: 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.1409 ≈ 0.14\n\nThat checks out. Similarly, in our problem, we're only given Total Current Liabilities, and no other liabilities are listed, so it's reasonable to assume that's the total debt for this calculation.\n\n### Final Calculation\nSo, for our problem:\n\nTotal Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3,376,304.04  \nTotal Assets = 19,520,226.07  \nDebt to Asset Ratio = 3,376,304.04 / 19,520,226.07 ≈ 0.17\n\n### Potential Missteps\nI initially wondered if I should include any other items as debt, like maybe \"Taxes Payable\" is separate, but it's already included in \"Total Current Liabilities.\" Similarly, \"Accounts Payable\" is part of current liabilities. \n\nAlso, I considered if \"Paid-in Capital\" or \"Retained Earnings\" could be part of debt, but those are equity, not debt. So, they shouldn't be included in the numerator.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter carefully going through the balance sheet and understanding the components, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.17.\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.17'} }\n```",
