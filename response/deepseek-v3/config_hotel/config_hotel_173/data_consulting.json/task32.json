                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested metrics based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nFree Cash Flow is typically calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} - \\text{Capital Expenditures} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -4,510,837.08\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (Capital Expenditures): 251,793.02\n\nSo,\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = -4,510,837.08 - 251,793.02 = -4,762,630.10 \\]\n\nThis matches the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents at the bottom of the cash flow statement, which is -4,762,630.10.\n\n### 2. Return on Assets (ROA)\nROA measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit. It's calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\nWhere Average Total Assets is \\((\\text{Beginning Total Assets} + \\text{Ending Total Assets}) / 2\\).\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Total Assets: 16,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets: 19,520,226.07\n- Net Profit: 143,922.03\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{16,000,000.00 + 19,520,226.07}{2} = \\frac{35,520,226.07}{2} = 17,760,113.035 \\]\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\frac{143,922.03}{17,760,113.035} \\approx 0.0081 \\text{ or } 0.81\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Return on Equity (ROE)\nROE measures the profitability relative to shareholders' equity. It's calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\nWhere Average Shareholders' Equity is \\((\\text{Beginning Equity} + \\text{Ending Equity}) / 2\\).\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Equity: 16,000,000.00 (Paid-in Capital + Retained Earnings initially)\n- Ending Equity: 16,143,922.03 (Paid-in Capital: 16,000,000.00 + Retained Earnings: 143,922.03)\n- Net Profit: 143,922.03\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Equity} = \\frac{16,000,000.00 + 16,143,922.03}{2} = \\frac{32,143,922.03}{2} = 16,071,961.015 \\]\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{143,922.03}{16,071,961.015} \\approx 0.00895 \\text{ or } 0.895\\% \\]\n\n### 4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\nThis ratio shows how much cash is generated from operating activities relative to net income.\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -4,510,837.08\n- Net Profit: 143,922.03\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-4,510,837.08}{143,922.03} \\approx -31.34 \\]\n\nThis negative ratio indicates that the operating cash flow is negative while net income is positive, which might be unusual and warrants further investigation.\n\n### 5. Net Profit Margin\nThis shows what percentage of revenue is profit.\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit: 143,922.03\n- Total Revenue: 851,679.79\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{143,922.03}{851,679.79} \\times 100\\% \\approx 16.90\\% \\]\n\n### 6. Gross Profit Margin\nThis shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold.\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit: 308,309.79\n- Total Revenue: 851,679.79\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{308,309.79}{851,679.79} \\times 100\\% \\approx 36.20\\% \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-4762630.10', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '0.81%', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.90%', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-31.34', 'Net Profit Margin': '16.90%', 'Gross Profit Margin': '36.20%'}}\n```\n\n*Note: There seems to be a discrepancy in the ROE calculation where the ending equity is higher than the beginning equity plus net profit (16,000,000 + 143,922.03 = 16,143,922.03 matches the ending equity), so the calculation is correct. The ROA and ROE are relatively low, and the negative operating cash flow despite positive net income is unusual, possibly due to significant increases in working capital (like inventory and receivables).*",
