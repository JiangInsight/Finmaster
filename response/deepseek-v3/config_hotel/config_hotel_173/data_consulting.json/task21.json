                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two things: the Free Cash Flow (FCF) and the Current Assets Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements. \n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\n**Free Cash Flow (FCF):**\nFree Cash Flow is a measure of how much cash a company generates after accounting for capital expenditures like fixed assets. It's an important metric because it shows how much cash is available for the company to repay creditors, pay dividends, or reinvest in the business.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement, FCF can often be derived from the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents, especially if it accounts for operating and investing activities. Alternatively, it can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} + \\text{Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities} \\]\nBut looking at the example provided, the FCF seems to be the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents, which is \"-7565348.53\" in the example. So, I'll follow that approach.\n\n**Current Assets Turnover Ratio:**\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales. The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}} \\]\nWhere:\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Current Assets} + \\text{Ending Current Assets}}{2} \\]\nIn the example, it's calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{8000000 + 7956806.47}{2} = 7978403.235 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5431018.59}{7978403.235} \\approx 0.68 \\]\n\n### Applying to the Given Problem\n\nNow, let's apply these definitions to the given problem.\n\n#### 1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nLooking at the cash flow statement, under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents,\" there's a \"Net Increase\" of \"-4762630.10\". Following the example, this seems to be the FCF.\n\nSo,\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = -4762630.10 \\]\n\nBut let's cross-validate:\n\\[ \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} = -4510837.08 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities} = -251793.02 \\]\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = -4510837.08 + (-251793.02) = -4762630.10 \\]\nThis matches the \"Net Increase,\" so our FCF is correct.\n\n#### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\nFirst, find the Total Revenue from the income statement:\n\\[ \\text{Total Revenue} = 851679.79 \\]\n\nNow, calculate Average Current Assets:\nFrom the balance sheet:\n\\[ \\text{Beginning Current Assets} = 8000000.00 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Ending Current Assets} = 11364912.39 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{8000000 + 11364912.39}{2} = \\frac{19364912.39}{2} = 9682456.195 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{851679.79}{9682456.195} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ 851679.79 / 9682456.195 \\approx 0.08796 \\]\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.09\n\nBut wait, in the example, the revenue was higher relative to current assets, giving 0.68. Here, revenue is much lower compared to current assets, so a lower ratio makes sense.\n\nHowever, let me double-check the calculation:\n\\[ 851679.79 / 9682456.195 \\]\nCalculating:\n9682456.195 goes into 851679.79 about 0.08796 times, so approximately 0.09.\n\nBut looking at the numbers, the revenue is about 851k, and average current assets are about 9.68 million, so 851k / 9.68m ≈ 0.0879, which is ~0.09.\n\nBut in the example, the ratio was 0.68 with revenue ~5.43m and average current assets ~7.98m, which is 5.43/7.98≈0.68. Here, it's much smaller, which seems correct given the numbers.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating:\n\n- Free Cash Flow (FCF): -4762630.10\n- Current Assets Turnover Ratio: 0.09\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-4762630.10', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.09'}}\n```",
