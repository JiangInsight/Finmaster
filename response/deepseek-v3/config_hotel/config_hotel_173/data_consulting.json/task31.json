                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the five ratios one by one using the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:** Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Main Business Revenue (assumed to be net credit sales) = 851,679.79\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable (2023-12-31) = 0.00\n- Ending Accounts Receivable (2024-02-04) = 335,967.05\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 335,967.05) / 2 = 167,983.525\n\nCalculation:\n851,679.79 / 167,983.525 ≈ 5.07\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,510,837.08\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,376,304.04\n\nCalculation:\n-4,510,837.08 / 3,376,304.04 ≈ -1.34\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis seems to be the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the example provided (both had the same value). So, it's likely another name for the same ratio.\n\nCalculation:\nSame as above: -1.34\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:** Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 851,679.79\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Assets (2023-12-31) = 16,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets (2024-02-04) = 19,520,226.07\n- Average Total Assets = (16,000,000 + 19,520,226.07) / 2 = 17,760,113.035\n\nCalculation:\n851,679.79 / 17,760,113.035 ≈ 0.048\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,376,304.04 (assuming no long-term liabilities, so total liabilities = current liabilities)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,143,922.03\n\nCalculation:\n3,376,304.04 / 16,143,922.03 ≈ 0.21\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '5.07', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-1.34', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.34', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.05', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21'}}\n```\n\n**Note:** \n- The Total Asset Turnover Ratio is quite low (0.05), which might seem unusual, but given the numbers (sales of ~851k against average assets of ~17.76 million), it checks out.\n- The Operating Cash Flow and its ratio to Current Liabilities are negative, indicating that the company's operating activities are consuming cash rather than generating it, which isn't ideal.\n- The Debt to Equity Ratio is 0.21, meaning the company has $0.21 in debt for every $1 in equity, which is a relatively low leverage ratio.",
