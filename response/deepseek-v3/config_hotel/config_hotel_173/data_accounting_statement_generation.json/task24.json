We need to sum the `amount` or `recorded_amount` for all these transactions.\n\n2. **List of Purchase Transactions**:\n   - Purchase20231231001: 790,000.0\n   - Purchase20231231002: 1,495,000.0\n   - Purchase20231231003: 374,400.0\n   - Purchase20231231004: 1,340,000.0\n   - Purchase20231231005: 146,080.0\n   - Purchase20231231006: 444,000.0\n   - Purchase20231231007: 154,500.0\n   - Purchase20231231008: 21,150.0\n   - Purchase20231231009: 34,350.0\n   - Purchase20231231010: 256,080.0\n   - Purchase20231231011: 21,000.0\n   - Purchase20231231012: 95,920.0\n   - Purchase20231231013: 409,500.0\n   - Purchase20231231014: 432,000.0\n   - Purchase20231231015: 39,900.0\n   - Purchase20231231016: 46,550.0\n   - Purchase20231231017: 97,650.0\n   - Purchase20231231018: 448,500.0\n   - Purchase20231231019: 222,000.0\n   - Purchase20231231020: 524,160.0\n   - Purchase20231231021: 15,150.0\n   - Purchase20231231022: 838,080.0\n   - Purchase20231231023: 81,200.0\n\n3. **Sum of Purchase Transactions**:\n   - Sum all the above amounts:\n     - 790,000 + 1,495,000 + 374,400 + 1,340,000 + 146,080 + 444,000 + 154,500 + 21,150 + 34,350 + 256,080 + 21,000 + 95,920 + 409,500 + 432,000 + 39,900 + 46,550 + 97,650 + 448,500 + 222,000 + 524,160 + 15,150 + 838,080 + 81,200 = 8,022,620.0\n\n4. **Other Cost-Related Transactions**:\n   - Fixed Assets Purchase (FixedAsset20231231001): 251,793.02\n   - Depreciation (Depreciation20240101001): 45,741.99\n   - Depreciation (Depreciation20240201002): 50,737.35\n   - These are not part of the cost of goods sold but are part of the total cost in the income statement. However, typically, the \"Total Cost\" in the income statement refers to the cost of goods sold (COGS), which is the sum of purchase transactions. If we are to include all costs, we would add these amounts as well, but based on the example provided, it seems only the purchase transactions are considered for \"Total Cost\".\n\n5. **Final Total Cost**:\n   - Based on the example, we only sum the purchase transactions, which is 8,022,620.0.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Cost': '8022620.00'}}\n```",
