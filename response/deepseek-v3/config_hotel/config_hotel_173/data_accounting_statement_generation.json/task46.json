Fixed assets are not considered part of cash and cash equivalents, so they should be excluded from this calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Cash and Bank Deposits:**\n   - The initial cash deposit is $3,000,000.00.\n   - The initial bank deposit is $5,000,000.00.\n\n2. **Sum the Initial Cash and Bank Deposits:**\n   - Total cash and cash equivalents = Cash deposit + Bank deposit\n   - Total = $3,000,000.00 + $5,000,000.00 = $8,000,000.00\n\n3. **Exclude Non-Cash Items:**\n   - Fixed assets ($8,000,000.00) are not part of cash and cash equivalents, so they are not included in the calculation.\n\n4. **Final Beginning Balance:**\n   - The beginning balance of cash and cash equivalents is $8,000,000.00.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
