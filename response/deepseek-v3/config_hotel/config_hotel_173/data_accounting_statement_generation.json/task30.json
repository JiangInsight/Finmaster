The expenses include:\n\n1. **Administrative Expenses**\n2. **Sales Expenses**\n3. **Financial Expenses**\n4. **Depreciation**\n5. **Interest Receivables** (though this is typically an income item, we'll include it if it's negative, but in this case, all interest receivables are positive, so they should not be included in expenses)\n\nHowever, based on the example provided, it seems that only the following expense types are considered for the \"Total Expenses\":\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Sales Expenses\n- Financial Expenses\n- Depreciation\n\nLet's go through the transactions and sum up these expenses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Depreciation**:\n   - Depreciation20240101001: 45741.98999999999\n   - Depreciation20240201002: 50737.35\n   - Total Depreciation = 45741.98999999999 + 50737.35 = 96479.34\n\n2. **Administrative Expenses**:\n   - Expense20240101001: 615.36\n   - Expense20240105001: 477.24 + 301.69 = 778.93\n   - Expense20240113001: 856.94 + 304.95 = 1161.89\n   - Expense20240115001: 651.86\n   - Expense20240116001: 661.76\n   - Expense20240117001: 611.42\n   - Expense20240121001: 925.82\n   - Expense20240123001: 358.91\n   - Expense20240128001: 715.18\n   - Expense20240129001: 831.34\n   - Expense20240131001: 418.63\n   - Expense20240201001: 739.88 + 269.03 = 1008.91\n   - Expense20240203001: 885.97\n   - Expense20240204001: 884.93\n   - Total Administrative Expenses = 615.36 + 778.93 + 1161.89 + 651.86 + 661.76 + 611.42 + 925.82 + 358.91 + 715.18 + 831.34 + 418.63 + 1008.91 + 885.97 + 884.93 = 9551.88\n\n3. **Sales Expenses**:\n   - Expense20240102001: 818.23\n   - Expense20240103001: 476.79\n   - Expense20240104001: 744.35\n   - Expense20240106001: 733.63\n   - Expense20240115001: 944.59\n   - Expense20240118001: 962.21\n   - Expense20240119001: 784.06\n   - Expense20240122001: 202.16\n   - Expense20240124001: 720.7\n   - Expense20240126001: 444.79\n   - Expense20240127001: 898.56\n   - Expense20240129001: 831.34\n   - Expense20240130001: 788.26 + 753.93 = 1542.19\n   - Expense20240203001: 109.32\n   - Total Sales Expenses = 818.23 + 476.79 + 744.35 + 733.63 + 944.59 + 962.21 + 784.06 + 202.16 + 720.7 + 444.79 + 898.56 + 831.34 + 1542.19 + 109.32 = 9630.52\n\n4. **Financial Expenses**:\n   - Expense20240106001: 341.86\n   - Expense20240107001: 160.75\n   - Expense20240120001: 752.32\n   - Expense20240122001: 845.07\n   - Expense20240125001: 845.07\n   - Expense20240127001: 112.95\n   - Expense20240128001: 603.61\n   - Expense20240129001: 990.77\n   - Expense20240202001: 724.84\n   - Total Financial Expenses = 341.86 + 160.75 + 752.32 + 845.07 + 845.07 + 112.95 + 603.61 + 990.77 + 724.84 = 5476.24\n\n### Total Expenses:\nNow, sum all the above:\n- Total Depreciation: 96479.34\n- Total Administrative Expenses: 9551.88\n- Total Sales Expenses: 9630.52\n- Total Financial Expenses: 5476.24\n\nTotal Expenses = 96479.34 + 9551.88 + 9630.52 + 5476.24 = 121137.98\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, it seems that \"Interest Receivables\" was not included in the total expenses. So, we'll exclude it here as well.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Expenses': '121137.98'} }\n```",
