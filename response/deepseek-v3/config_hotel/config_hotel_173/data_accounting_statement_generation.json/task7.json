In the provided data, there is a transaction with the type \"Fixed Assets\" and the amount is \"8000000.0\". This is the initial value of the fixed assets.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Any Fixed Assets Purchases\nNext, we need to check if there are any purchases of fixed assets during the period. In the data, there is a transaction with the type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" and the amount is \"251793.02\". This is an addition to the fixed assets.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Final Fixed Assets Value\nThe final fixed assets value is the sum of the initial fixed assets and any additions (purchases) minus any depreciation. From the data, there are depreciation entries:\n- \"Depreciation20240101001\" with amount \"45741.98999999999\"\n- \"Depreciation20240201002\" with amount \"50737.35\"\n\nTotal depreciation = 45741.98999999999 + 50737.35 = 96479.34\n\nHowever, in the example provided, depreciation was not subtracted from the fixed assets value to get the end value. It seems the end value is simply the initial value plus any fixed assets purchases. Therefore, we will follow the same approach here.\n\nFinal Fixed Assets Value = Initial Fixed Assets + Fixed Assets Purchases\n= 8000000.0 + 251793.02 = 8251793.02\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Fixed Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Fixed Assets End Value': '8251793.02'} }\n```",
