This represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\nHereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate the Income Statement**: The income statement contains the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" which directly indicates the cost associated with the inventory sold during the period.\n2. **Extract the Value**: In the income statement provided, the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is listed as **543370.00**.\n\nThus, the value of the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is **543370.00**.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '543370.00'}}\n```",
