The \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section typically includes the beginning balance, ending balance, and the net increase or decrease.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, we look for the line item labeled \"Beginning Balance\". This represents the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with the \"Beginning Balance\" line item is the amount we need to extract.\n\n4. **Verify the Data**: In the provided problem, the \"Beginning Balance\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section is clearly listed as \"8000000.00\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
