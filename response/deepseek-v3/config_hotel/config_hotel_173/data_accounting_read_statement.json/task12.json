These are typically classified as \"Current Assets\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Assets**: Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within one year or the operating cycle of the business, whichever is longer. In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of all such assets.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**: The initial value of the current assets is provided under the \"Initial_amount\" column for the \"Total Current Assets\" line item. In the problem, this value is `8000000.00` as of the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**: The end value of the current assets is provided under the \"End_amount\" column for the \"Total Current Assets\" line item. In the problem, this value is `11364912.39` as of the end date `2024-02-04`.\n\n4. **Verify**: The initial and end values correspond to the \"Total Current Assets\" line, which includes items like Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, Accounts Receivable, and Inventoryâ€”all of which are expected to be realized or consumed in the normal operating cycle.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '11364912.39'} }\n```",
