I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we need.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific values from the financial statements:\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under \"Paid-in Capital\" or similar.\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is usually the \"Profit Before Tax\" line in the Income Statement.\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This is the increase in \"Accounts Payable,\" which can be found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\"\n\nThe order to present these is: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet - Capital Contributed by Shareholders\nLooking at the Balance Sheet provided, there's a line item:\n```\nPaid-in Capital | 16000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 16000000.00 | 2024-02-04 |\n```\nThis represents the capital contributed by shareholders. The \"End_amount\" is `16000000.00`, which hasn't changed from the initial amount, indicating no new capital was added during this period. However, since the task asks for the capital contributed, and it's unchanged, we'll take the ending amount as is.\n\n**Value1: 16000000.00**\n\n### 2. Income Statement - Profit Before Tax\nIn the Income Statement, we see:\n```\nProfit Before Tax | 186506.07 | 2024-02-04 |\n```\nThis is the profit or loss before tax expense.\n\n**Value2: 186506.07**\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement - Increase in Accounts Payable\nIn the Cash Flow Statement, under operating activities:\n```\nIncrease (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 3333720.00 | 2024-02-04 |\n```\nThis shows the increase in the amount owed by the entity for goods/services purchased on credit during the period.\n\n**Value3: 3333720.00**\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe order is correct as per the instructions:\n1. Balance Sheet (Paid-in Capital)\n2. Income Statement (Profit Before Tax)\n3. Cash Flow Statement (Increase in Accounts Payable)\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16000000.00', 'value2': '186506.07', 'value3': '3333720.00'}}\n```",
