In the income statement, this is typically represented by \"Main Business Revenue\" or similar line items that directly relate to the main operations of the business (e.g., sales revenue, service revenue).\n2. **Identify the Line Item**: In the given problem, the line item \"Main Business Revenue\" clearly represents income from core operating activities.\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Main Business Revenue\" is \"851679.79\".\n\n### Solution:\nThe value of income arising from the entity's core operating activities is \"851679.79\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '851679.79'}}\n```",
