The task asks for the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from investing activities, specifically:\n   - Acquisition/disposal of long-term assets\n   - Other investments not included in cash equivalents\n   - Receipt of interest and dividends\n\n2. Looking at the cash flow statement provided, under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\", we see:\n   - \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with amount 251793.02 (this represents acquisition of long-term assets)\n   - \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with amount -251793.02\n\n3. The net cash flow from investing activities (-251793.02) is calculated from:\n   - Only one component: Purchase of Fixed Assets (251793.02)\n   - Since it's a purchase (outflow), it's shown as negative in the net calculation\n\n4. There are no other items listed under investing activities (no interest/dividends receipts or other investments), so the purchase of fixed assets is the only component.\n\n5. Therefore:\n   - Value (net cash flow from investing activities): -251793.02\n   - Sub-item (purchase of fixed assets): 251793.02\n\nThe solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-251793.02\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value\": \"251793.02\"}}}\n```",
