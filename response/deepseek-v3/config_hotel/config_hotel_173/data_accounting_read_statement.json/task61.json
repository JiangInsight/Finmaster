The two items we need to find are:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**: This typically refers to \"Selling Expenses\" in the income statement, as these are costs associated with marketing, sales, and delivering products/services to customers.\n   \n2. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is usually found in the cash flow statement under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" or similar, representing cash outflows for acquiring long-term assets.\n\nThe financial statements provided are:\n- Balance Sheet\n- Income Statement\n- Cash Flow Statement\n\nWe need to search these statements in the order mentioned (Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement, then Cash Flow Statement) to find the relevant line items.\n\n### Step 1: Searching the Balance Sheet\n\nFirst, I'll scan the Balance Sheet for any line items that might match the two descriptions.\n\n- **Costs to secure orders/deliver goods**: The Balance Sheet typically doesn't include expense items; it's more about assets, liabilities, and equity. So, it's unlikely to find this here.\n  \n- **Cash payments for long-term assets**: The Balance Sheet shows \"Fixed Assets\" and changes in them, but not the cash payments directly. The \"Fixed Assets\" line shows an increase from 8,000,000.00 to 8,251,793.02, but this doesn't directly tell us the cash spent (it could include non-cash changes like depreciation).\n\n**Conclusion**: Neither of the required items is directly found in the Balance Sheet.\n\n### Step 2: Searching the Income Statement\n\nNext, I'll look at the Income Statement.\n\n- **Costs to secure orders/deliver goods**: This is likely \"Selling Expenses\". In the Income Statement, we see:\n  - `Selling Expenses | 12001.12 | 2024-02-04`\n  \n  This matches the description as these are costs related to selling and delivering goods/services.\n\n- **Cash payments for long-term assets**: The Income Statement shows expenses like depreciation, but not cash payments for assets. Depreciation is a non-cash expense related to assets but doesn't represent cash outflows.\n\n**Found**: \"Selling Expenses\" = 12001.12 (this is `value1`)\n\n### Step 3: Searching the Cash Flow Statement\n\nNow, the Cash Flow Statement.\n\n- **Cash payments for long-term assets**: This should be under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\". We see:\n  - `Purchase of Fixed Assets | 251793.02 | 2024-02-04`\n  \n  This represents cash spent on acquiring fixed assets (property, plant, equipment).\n\n**Found**: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = 251793.02 (this is `value2`)\n\n### Verifying the Findings\n\n- **value1 (Selling Expenses)**: Confirmed as the cost to secure/deliver orders.\n- **value2 (Purchase of Fixed Assets)**: Confirmed as cash payments for long-term assets.\n\nNo other line items in the statements seem to match these descriptions better.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '12001.12', 'value2': '251793.02'}}\n```",
