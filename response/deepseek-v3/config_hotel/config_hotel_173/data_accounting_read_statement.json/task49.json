                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through the cash flow statement provided and identify the three specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to extract three specific pieces of information from the cash flow statement:\n\n1. **The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This typically refers to the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" because accounts payable represent amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit.\n   \n2. **Acquisition of property, plant and equipment**: This is usually listed as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the cash flow statement under investing activities.\n   \n3. **Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period**: This is the \"Beginning Balance\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Cash Flow Statement\n\nLet's look at the provided cash flow statement and locate these items.\n\n#### 1. Increase in Amount Owed (Accounts Payable)\nLooking at the operating activities section:\n- \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is listed with an amount of `3333720.00`. This is the value we're interested in for the first item.\n\n#### 2. Acquisition of Property, Plant, and Equipment (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\nUnder the investing activities section:\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is listed with an amount of `251793.02`. This corresponds to the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment.\n\n#### 3. Cash and Cash Equivalents at the Beginning of the Period\nUnder the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section:\n- \"Beginning Balance\" is `8000000.00`. This is the starting amount of cash and cash equivalents for the period.\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe problem specifies that for multiple outputs, we should maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement. \n\nLooking at the order in the statement:\n1. \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" appears first in the operating activities.\n2. \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" comes next in the investing activities.\n3. \"Beginning Balance\" is last under cash and cash equivalents.\n\nSo, the order is correct as per the statement's sequence.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the above analysis, the three values are:\n1. Increase in Accounts Payable: `3333720.00`\n2. Purchase of Fixed Assets: `251793.02`\n3. Beginning Cash Balance: `8000000.00`\n\nTherefore, the solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3333720.00', 'value2': '251793.02', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
