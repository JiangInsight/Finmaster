These are typically the non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets and accumulated depreciation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Non-Current Assets**: \n   - Non-current assets are those that are not expected to be converted into cash or used up within the normal operating cycle (usually one year). In the given balance sheet, the non-current assets are represented by \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" and their total is given as \"Total Non-current Assets.\"\n\n2. **Locate Initial and End Values**:\n   - The initial value of non-current assets is provided under \"Total Non-current Assets\" with the \"Initial_amount\" of \"8000000.00\" as of the \"Initial_date\" \"2023-12-31.\"\n   - The end value of non-current assets is provided under \"Total Non-current Assets\" with the \"End_amount\" of \"8155313.68\" as of the \"End_date\" \"2024-02-04.\"\n\n3. **Verify the Line Items**:\n   - The line items under non-current assets are \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation.\" The net value of these is reflected in \"Total Non-current Assets,\" which is the correct value to use for this task.\n\n4. **Extract the Values**:\n   - Initial value: \"8000000.00\"\n   - End value: \"8155313.68\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '8155313.68'} }\n```",
