Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. It is typically listed under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities.\"\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the given cash flow statement, we look for the line item labeled \"Depreciation\" under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value corresponding to the \"Depreciation\" line item is the amount we need to extract. \n\n4. **Verify the Context**: Ensure that the line item is indeed \"Depreciation\" and not something similar, and that it is under the correct section (Operating Activities).\n\n5. **Check the Example**: The example provided confirms that the value for \"Depreciation\" is the one to be extracted, as shown in the solution {'value': '45751.41'}.\n\n6. **Apply to the Problem**: In the problem to solve, the \"Depreciation\" line item has a value of \"96479.34.\"\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '96479.34'}}\n```",
