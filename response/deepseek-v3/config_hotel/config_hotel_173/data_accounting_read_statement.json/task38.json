                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line item and value that represents the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit during the period. This is typically reflected in the cash flow statement under the \"Operating Activities\" section as \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task is to find the line item that shows the change in accounts receivable, which indicates the decrease (or increase) in amounts owed to the entity by customers for credit sales.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, look for the line item labeled \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable.\"\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with this line item represents the change in accounts receivable. A negative value indicates an increase in accounts receivable (less cash collected), and a positive value indicates a decrease (more cash collected).\n4. **Verify the Line Item**: Ensure that the line item is indeed related to amounts owed for goods or services sold on credit, which is \"Accounts Receivable.\"\n\n### Application to the Given Problem:\n- In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" has a value of \"-335967.05.\" This means there was an increase in accounts receivable (less cash collected), but the task is to extract the value as it represents the change in amounts owed.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-335967.05'}}\n```",
