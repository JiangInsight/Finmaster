This is typically listed under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" represents the change in the amount of tax that has been accrued but not yet paid. \n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" is \"42584.04\".\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The value is positive, indicating an increase in tax payable (i.e., more tax has been accrued but not yet paid). This matches the description of the task.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '42584.04'}}\n```",
