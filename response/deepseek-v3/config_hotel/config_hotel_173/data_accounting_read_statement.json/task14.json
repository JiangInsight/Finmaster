These are typically classified as \"Current Liabilities\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Liabilities**: \n   - Current liabilities are obligations that are expected to be settled within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually within one year). \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Current Liabilities\" are:\n     - Accounts Payable\n     - Taxes Payable\n     - Total Current Liabilities\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `3376304.04` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-02-04`.\n\n3. **Verify**:\n   - The \"Total Current Liabilities\" is the sum of all individual current liabilities (Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 3333720.00 + 42584.04 = 3376304.04), which matches the given value.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3376304.04'}}\n```",
