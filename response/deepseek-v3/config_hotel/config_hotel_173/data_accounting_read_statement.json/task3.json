This is typically labeled as \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item \"Accounts Receivable\" is the amount owed to the entity by customers for goods or services sold on credit. This is the item we are interested in.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value and Date**:\n   - In the given balance sheet, the \"Accounts Receivable\" line shows an \"Initial_amount\" of \"0.00\" and an \"Initial_date\" of \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value and Date**:\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Accounts Receivable\" is \"335967.05\" and the \"End_date\" is \"2024-02-04\".\n\n4. **Verify the Data**:\n   - The initial value is indeed \"0.00\" and the end value is \"335967.05\", which aligns with the task's requirement to extract the amounts owed for goods or services sold on credit.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '335967.05'} }\n```",
