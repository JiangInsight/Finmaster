This is typically reflected in the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" line item under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are looking for the increase in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit. This is captured by the \"Accounts Payable\" line in the cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is present under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is \"3333720.00\". This indicates an increase in accounts payable, meaning the entity owes more for goods or services purchased on credit during the period.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The value is positive, which aligns with the description of an increase in the amount owed. Negative values would indicate a decrease.\n\n5. **Final Answer**: The value to be extracted is \"3333720.00\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3333720.00'} }\n```",
