These assets are typically categorized as \"Inventory\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - From the given balance sheet, the line item that represents assets held for sale or in production is \"Inventory\".\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Inventory\" is given as \"0.00\" on the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Inventory\" is given as \"7783800.00\" on the end date \"2024-02-04\".\n\n4. **Verify**:\n   - Ensure that no other line items (e.g., \"Accounts Receivable\", \"Fixed Assets\") are mistakenly considered as assets held for sale or in production. Only \"Inventory\" fits the description.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '7783800.00'} }\n```",
