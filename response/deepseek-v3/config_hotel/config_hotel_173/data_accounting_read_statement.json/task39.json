Since the value is negative, it actually represents an increase, not a reduction. However, the task might be referring to the absolute value or the line item itself. Given the example provided, the solution is the value of the line item regardless of its sign.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-7783800.00'}}\n```",
