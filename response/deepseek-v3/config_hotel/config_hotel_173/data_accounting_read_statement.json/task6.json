These items are typically classified as \"Fixed Assets\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: \n   - The line item \"Fixed Assets\" represents tangible items held for use in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes. This is the primary item we are interested in.\n   - \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is related to fixed assets but represents the depreciation over time, not the tangible value itself. The net value of fixed assets is adjusted by accumulated depreciation, but the initial and end values of the tangible assets are given by \"Fixed Assets\" before depreciation.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - From the given balance sheet, the \"Fixed Assets\" line item shows:\n     - Initial_amount: 8000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: 8251793.02 (as of 2024-02-04)\n\n3. **Verify Other Line Items**:\n   - Other line items like \"Cash on Hand\", \"Bank Deposits\", \"Inventory\", etc., are not tangible assets held for production or administrative purposes. They are either current assets or other types of assets.\n   - \"Total Non-current Assets\" includes fixed assets and other non-current assets, but we are specifically interested in the \"Fixed Assets\" line item.\n\n4. **Final Values**:\n   - The initial value of tangible assets is the initial amount of \"Fixed Assets\".\n   - The end value of tangible assets is the end amount of \"Fixed Assets\".\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '8251793.02'} }\n```",
