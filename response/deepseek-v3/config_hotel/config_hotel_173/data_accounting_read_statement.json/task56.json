This is typically referred to as \"Depreciation\" in financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Depreciation in the Balance Sheet**:\n   - In the balance sheet, there is an \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item with an \"End_amount\" of \"96479.34\". This represents the total depreciation accumulated up to the end date.\n\n2. **Identify Depreciation in the Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - In the cash flow statement, there is a \"Depreciation\" line item with an \"Amount\" of \"96479.34\". This represents the depreciation expense for the period.\n\n3. **Identify Depreciation in the Income Statement**:\n   - In the income statement, there is a \"Depreciation\" line item under expenses with an \"Amount\" of \"96479.34\". This confirms the depreciation expense for the period.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The value of depreciation is consistently reported as \"96479.34\" across all relevant sections of the financial statements.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '96479.34'}}\n```",
