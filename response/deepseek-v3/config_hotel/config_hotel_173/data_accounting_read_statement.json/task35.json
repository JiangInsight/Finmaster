                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through the income statement provided and identify the four specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nFirst, let's recap what we're being asked to find:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**: This typically refers to \"Selling Expenses\" in an income statement. These are costs associated with marketing, sales, and distribution of products or services.\n\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually labeled as \"Financial Expenses\" or \"Interest Expense\" in the income statement. These are costs related to borrowing money, like interest on loans.\n\n3. **The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is straightforwardâ€”it's \"Depreciation.\" It's the allocation of the cost of tangible assets over their useful lives.\n\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period**: This is the \"Tax Expense\" or \"Income Tax Expense,\" representing the taxes owed on the profits for the period.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Income Statement\n\nNow, let's look at the provided income statement and pick out these items:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 851679.79 | 2024-02-04 |\n| Total Revenue | 851679.79 | 2024-02-04 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 543370.00 | 2024-02-04 |\n| Total Cost | 543370.00 | 2024-02-04 |\n| Gross Profit | 308309.79 | 2024-02-04 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 16566.53 | 2024-02-04 |\n| Selling Expenses | 12001.12 | 2024-02-04 |\n| Depreciation | 96479.34 | 2024-02-04 |\n| Financial Expenses | 4532.17 | 2024-02-04 |\n| Total Expenses | 129579.16 | 2024-02-04 |\n| Interest Income | 7775.44 | 2024-02-04 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 186506.07 | 2024-02-04 |\n| Tax Expense | 42584.04 | 2024-02-04 |\n| Net Profit | 143922.03 | 2024-02-04 |\n\n### Identifying the Required Line Items\n\n1. **Selling Expenses**: This is directly listed as \"Selling Expenses\" with an amount of `12001.12`.\n   \n2. **Depreciation**: Listed as \"Depreciation\" with an amount of `96479.34`.\n\n3. **Financial Expenses**: Listed as \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of `4532.17`.\n\n4. **Tax Expense**: Listed as \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of `42584.04`.\n\n### Verifying the Order\n\nThe problem mentions that for multiple outputs, we should maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement. Looking at the order in the income statement:\n\n- Selling Expenses\n- Depreciation\n- Financial Expenses\n- Tax Expense\n\nThis is the sequence in which these items appear in the table, so we'll list them in that order in our solution.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together, the values are:\n\n- value1 (Selling Expenses): '12001.12'\n- value2 (Depreciation): '96479.34'\n- value3 (Financial Expenses): '4532.17'\n- value4 (Tax Expense): '42584.04'\n\nHere's the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '12001.12', 'value2': '96479.34', 'value3': '4532.17', 'value4': '42584.04'} }\n```",
