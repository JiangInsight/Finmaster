                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we're interested in.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to identify and extract three specific line items from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit**: This typically refers to \"Accounts Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet.\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually \"Financial Expenses\" in the Income Statement.\n3. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is often \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThe order of extraction is important: Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement, then Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet - Accounts Receivable\nLooking at the Balance Sheet provided, we have the following line:\n\n| Account | Initial_amount | Initial_date | End_amount | End_date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Accounts Receivable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 335967.05 | 2024-02-04 |\n\nThe \"End_amount\" for \"Accounts Receivable\" is **335967.05**. This is the amount owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit.\n\n### 2. Income Statement - Financial Expenses\nNow, let's look at the Income Statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Financial Expenses | 4532.17 | 2024-02-04 |\n\nThe \"Amount\" for \"Financial Expenses\" is **4532.17**. This represents the financing costs incurred to raise funds.\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement - Purchase of Fixed Assets\nFinally, examining the Cash Flow Statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 251793.02 | 2024-02-04 |\n\nThe \"Amount\" for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is **251793.02**. This is the cash paid to acquire long-term assets like property, plant, and equipment.\n\n### Verifying the Order\nJust to ensure we're following the correct order:\n1. Balance Sheet: Accounts Receivable - 335967.05\n2. Income Statement: Financial Expenses - 4532.17\n3. Cash Flow Statement: Purchase of Fixed Assets - 251793.02\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '335967.05', 'value2': '4532.17', 'value3': '251793.02'} }\n```",
