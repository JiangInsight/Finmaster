                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the solution.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task is about analyzing a cash flow statement to extract specific information related to cash flows from investing activities. Here's what we need to do:\n\n1. **Identify the Net Amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents from Investing Activities**: This is the total cash generated or used in investing activities.\n2. **Decompose this Item into 1 Component Sub-item**: This means we need to find one line item that contributes to the net cash flow from investing activities.\n3. **Output the Values**: Provide the net amount and the value of the sub-item.\n\nFrom the example given, it seems that the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is the main value, and its sub-item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nLet's look at the provided cash flow statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-02 |\n| Net Profit  | 112375.10 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Depreciation  | 115511.91 | 2024-02-02 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -321015.98 | 2024-02-02 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -12737.96 | 2024-02-02 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -8466430.00 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 7566370.00 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 38779.91 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -967147.02 | 2024-02-02 |\n| **Cash Flow from Investing Activities** |  | **2024-02-02** |\n| **Purchase of Fixed Assets**  | **1213417.20** | **2024-02-02** |\n| **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**  | **-1213417.20** | **2024-02-02** |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-02 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Ending Balance  | 5819435.78 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Net Increase  | -2180564.22 | 2024-02-02 |\n\n### Identifying the Required Items\n\n1. **Net Amount of Cash from Investing Activities**: This is clearly given as \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with a value of `-1213417.20`.\n2. **Sub-item**: The only line item under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of `1213417.20`. This is the component that makes up the net cash flow from investing activities.\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nThe net cash flow from investing activities is typically the sum of all investing activities. Here, there's only one item:\n\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: `1213417.20` (this is an outflow, hence negative in the net calculation)\n  \nSo, Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = `-1213417.20`\n\nThis matches the given value, confirming our identification is correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nFollowing the example's format, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1213417.20', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '1213417.20'}}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Locate Investing Activities Section**: Found under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\"\n2. **Identify Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: `-1213417.20`.\n3. **Find Sub-items**: Only \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is listed with `1213417.20`.\n4. **Confirm Calculation**: Single sub-item's value equals the absolute value of the net cash flow (since it's the only component).\n5. **Format Answer**: Use the given JSON structure with the identified values.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully examining the cash flow statement and understanding the structure, the required values are correctly identified and formatted as per the instructions.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1213417.20', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '1213417.20'}}}\n```",
