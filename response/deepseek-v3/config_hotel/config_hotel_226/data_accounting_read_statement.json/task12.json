These are typically referred to as \"Current Assets.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Assets**: Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within one year or the operating cycle of the business, whichever is longer. In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of all such assets.\n\n2. **Locate Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Current Assets\" is `8000000.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Assets\" is `14619619.72` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-02-02`.\n\n3. **Verify Other Line Items**: The other line items under \"Current Assets\" (e.g., Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, Accounts Receivable, Inventory) are all components that contribute to the \"Total Current Assets.\" However, the task specifically asks for the total value, not the individual components.\n\n4. **Exclude Non-Current Assets**: Fixed Assets and Accumulated Depreciation are part of \"Non-Current Assets\" and are not expected to be realized or consumed in the normal operating cycle, so they are excluded from this task.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe initial and end values of the total current assets are as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '14619619.72'} }\n```",
