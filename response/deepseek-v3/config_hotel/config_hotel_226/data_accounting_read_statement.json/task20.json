This is because COGS reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, which includes the cost of the inventory sold.\n   \n2. **Identifying the Line Item**: In the given income statement, the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is present with an amount of \"496220.00\".\n\n3. **Verification**: \n   - The \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is directly related to the inventory sold during the period.\n   - The amount is listed under the \"Amount\" column, and the date is consistent with the reporting period (2024-02-02).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The value to be extracted is \"496220.00\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '496220.00'}}\n```",
