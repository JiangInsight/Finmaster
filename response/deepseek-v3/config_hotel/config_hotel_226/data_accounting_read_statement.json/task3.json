This is typically labeled as \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item \"Accounts Receivable\" is the standard account that records amounts owed to the entity by customers for goods or services sold on credit.\n\n2. **Locate the Initial and End Values**:\n   - In the given balance sheet, the \"Accounts Receivable\" line item shows:\n     - **Initial_amount**: 0.00 (as of the initial date 2023-12-31)\n     - **End_amount**: 321015.98 (as of the end date 2024-02-02)\n\n3. **Extract the Values**:\n   - The initial value is the amount at the start of the period (Initial_amount).\n   - The end value is the amount at the end of the period (End_amount).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '321015.98'} }\n```",
