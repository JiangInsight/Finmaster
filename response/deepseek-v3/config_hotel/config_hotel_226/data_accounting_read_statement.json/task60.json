I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the correct answers.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe have three financial statements provided:\n1. **Balance Sheet**\n2. **Income Statement**\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**\n\nOur goal is to:\n- Identify and extract two specific line items:\n  1. The end value of funds deposited into a bank.\n  2. The income earned by an entity from financial assets.\n- Group these by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement.\n- Within each group, maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement.\n\nFrom the example provided, it seems:\n- The \"Bank Deposits\" line in the Balance Sheet gives the end value of funds deposited into a bank (`value1`).\n- The \"Interest Income\" line in the Income Statement gives the income earned from financial assets (`value2`).\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nLet's look at the current problem's financial statements to find these two values.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking for \"Bank Deposits\":\n```\n| Bank Deposits | 5000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 3752082.80 | 2024-02-02 |\n```\nThe end amount here is `3752082.80`. This seems to be `value1`.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nLooking for \"Interest Income\":\n```\n| Interest Income | 12737.96 | 2024-02-02 |\n```\nThis is `12737.96`, which seems to be `value2`.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nIn the example, the Cash Flow Statement wasn't used to extract any values, but it's part of the grouping order. Here, we don't seem to have any line items that match our criteria, so we might not extract anything from here.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nIn the example:\n- `value1` was \"164645.57\" from \"Bank Deposits\" in the Balance Sheet.\n- `value2` was \"2672.87\" from \"Interest Income\" in the Income Statement.\n\nThis matches our approach.\n\n### Potential Confusion Points\n\n- **Financial Assets Income**: Is \"Interest Income\" the correct line item? Yes, interest is typically earned from financial assets like loans or deposits.\n- **Bank Deposits**: Is \"Bank Deposits\" the correct line for funds deposited into a bank? Yes, it represents money held in bank accounts.\n- **Order**: The order is Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement, then Cash Flow. We're maintaining the order of line items within each statement as they appear.\n\n### Final Extraction\n\nFrom the current problem:\n1. **Balance Sheet**:\n   - \"Bank Deposits\" end amount: `3752082.80` → `value1`\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - \"Interest Income\": `12737.96` → `value2`\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - No relevant line items found.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3752082.80', 'value2': '12737.96'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**:\n   - Funds deposited into a bank: Look for \"Bank Deposits\" in the Balance Sheet.\n   - Income from financial assets: Look for \"Interest Income\" in the Income Statement.\n\n2. **Extract Values**:\n   - From \"Bank Deposits\": End amount is `3752082.80`.\n   - From \"Interest Income\": Amount is `12737.96`.\n\n3. **Construct the Solution**:\n   - Follow the order: Balance Sheet first (`value1`), then Income Statement (`value2`).\n   - Format as per the given JSON structure.\n\nThus, the solution is correctly identified and formatted.",
