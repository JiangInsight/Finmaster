Here's how we can find the required values:\n\n1. **Initial Value**: Look for the \"Initial_amount\" under the \"Interest Receivable\" account in the balance sheet. \n   - In the provided balance sheet, the \"Interest Receivable\" account has an \"Initial_amount\" of \"0.00\" on the \"Initial_date\" of \"2023-12-31\".\n\n2. **End Value**: Look for the \"End_amount\" under the \"Interest Receivable\" account in the balance sheet.\n   - The \"Interest Receivable\" account has an \"End_amount\" of \"12737.96\" on the \"End_date\" of \"2024-02-02\".\n\nThus, the initial and end values for interest accrued but not yet received are as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '12737.96'} }\n```",
