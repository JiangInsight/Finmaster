This is typically found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities.\"\n\n2. **Amounts of taxes accrued but not yet paid**: This represents the taxes that the entity owes but hasn't paid yet, usually listed under \"Taxes Payable\" in the Balance Sheet.\n\n3. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**: This is the total revenue generated from the entity's ordinary activities, found in the Income Statement under \"Total Revenue.\"\n\nThe outputs should be grouped by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, the original line item order should be maintained.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Financial Statements\n\nLet's go through each financial statement to locate the required items.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking for \"Taxes Payable\":\n- In the Balance Sheet, there's a line item:\n  - Account: Taxes Payable\n  - End_amount: 38779.91\n  - End_date: 2024-02-02\n\nSo, **Taxes Payable (value1) = 38779.91**\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nLooking for \"Total Revenue\":\n- In the Income Statement, there's a line item:\n  - Account: Total Revenue\n  - Amount: 775598.77\n  - Date: 2024-02-02\n\nSo, **Total Revenue (value2) = 775598.77**\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nLooking for \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\":\n- In the Cash Flow Statement, there's a line item:\n  - Account: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n  - Amount: -967147.02\n  - Date: 2024-02-02\n\nSo, **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities (value3) = -967147.02**\n\n### Verifying the Order\n\nThe order of the financial statements is:\n1. Balance Sheet (Taxes Payable)\n2. Income Statement (Total Revenue)\n3. Cash Flow Statement (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities)\n\nThis matches the required order.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '38779.91', 'value2': '775598.77', 'value3': '-967147.02'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**:\n   - Located \"Taxes Payable\" with an end amount of 38779.91 → `value1 = '38779.91'`\n\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - Located \"Total Revenue\" with an amount of 775598.77 → `value2 = '775598.77'`\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - Located \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" with an amount of -967147.02 → `value3 = '-967147.02'`\n\n4. **Order Verification**:\n   - Ensured the order is Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement as required.\n\nThus, the final JSON output is correctly structured with the identified values.",
