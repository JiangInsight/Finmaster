                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to extract three specific line items from the given financial statements based on the task description. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to identify and extract the following three specific line items from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit**: This typically refers to \"Accounts Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet.\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually \"Financial Expenses\" in the Income Statement.\n3. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is often \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThe order of extraction is important: first from the Balance Sheet, then the Income Statement, and finally the Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### Extracting the Values\n\n1. **Balance Sheet - Accounts Receivable**:\n   - Looking at the Balance Sheet section, there's a line item called \"Accounts Receivable\".\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Accounts Receivable\" is `321015.98`.\n\n2. **Income Statement - Financial Expenses**:\n   - In the Income Statement, there's a line item labeled \"Financial Expenses\".\n   - The \"Amount\" for \"Financial Expenses\" is `438.86`.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement - Purchase of Fixed Assets**:\n   - In the Cash Flow Statement, under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\", there's \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n   - The \"Amount\" for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is `1213417.20`.\n\n### Verifying the Values\nLet me double-check each to ensure I'm picking the correct line items and amounts.\n\n- **Accounts Receivable**: Yes, it's under Balance Sheet, and `321015.98` is the end amount owed to the entity.\n- **Financial Expenses**: Correct, it's in the Income Statement, and `438.86` is the cost incurred for financing.\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: Right, it's under Cash Flow's Investing Activities, and `1213417.20` is the cash paid for long-term assets.\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, compiling these into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '321015.98', 'value2': '438.86', 'value3': '1213417.20'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. **Identify the line items**:\n   - Accounts Receivable (Balance Sheet)\n   - Financial Expenses (Income Statement)\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets (Cash Flow Statement)\n2. **Locate the amounts**:\n   - Accounts Receivable: `321015.98`\n   - Financial Expenses: `438.86`\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: `1213417.20`\n3. **Order them as per the task's sequence**:\n   - Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement, then Cash Flow.\n4. **Format the answer**:\n   - JSON with 'value1', 'value2', 'value3' corresponding to the order above.\n\nThis seems correct based on the given financial statements and the task's requirements.",
