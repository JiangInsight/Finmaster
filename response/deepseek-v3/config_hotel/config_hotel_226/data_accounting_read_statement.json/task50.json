I'm going to break down the task to understand what each of the four values we need to extract represents, and then locate them in the given cash flow statement.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task asks us to identify and extract four specific line items from the cash flow statement:\n\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is commonly known as **Depreciation**.\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period**: This refers to changes in **Inventory**.\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends**: This is the **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**.\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is the **Net Increase** in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nNow, let's find each of these in the provided cash flow statement.\n\n### Locating the Values in the Cash Flow Statement\n\nHere's the cash flow statement provided:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-02 |\n| Net Profit  | 112375.10 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Depreciation  | 115511.91 | 2024-02-02 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -321015.98 | 2024-02-02 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -12737.96 | 2024-02-02 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -8466430.00 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 7566370.00 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 38779.91 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -967147.02 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-02-02 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 1213417.20 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -1213417.20 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-02 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Ending Balance  | 5819435.78 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Net Increase  | -2180564.22 | 2024-02-02 |\n\nNow, let's identify each of the four required values:\n\n1. **Depreciation**: This is explicitly listed as \"Depreciation\" with an amount of `115511.91`.\n2. **Change in Inventory**: This is listed as \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with an amount of `-8466430.00`. The negative sign indicates an increase in inventory (since it's an outflow), but the absolute value represents the reduction or change.\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: This is listed as \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with an amount of `-1213417.20`.\n4. **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: This is listed as \"Net Increase\" with an amount of `-2180564.22`.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example:\n\n- `value1` was '45751.41' which corresponds to \"Depreciation\".\n- `value2` was '-5090000.00' which corresponds to \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\".\n- `value3` was '-305354.43' which corresponds to \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n- `value4` was '-7565348.53' which corresponds to \"Net Increase\".\n\nThis confirms our mapping is correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the above, the four values are:\n\n1. `value1` (Depreciation): '115511.91'\n2. `value2` (Change in Inventory): '-8466430.00'\n3. `value3` (Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities): '-1213417.20'\n4. `value4` (Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents): '-2180564.22'\n\nHere's the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '115511.91', 'value2': '-8466430.00', 'value3': '-1213417.20', 'value4': '-2180564.22'} }\n```",
