                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand what each part is asking for and then find the corresponding values in the given income statement.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to identify and extract three specific line items from the income statement along with their values:\n\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**: This typically refers to the total revenue generated from the main operations of the business. In income statements, this is often labeled as \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is essentially the cost associated with the goods that were sold during the period. In accounting terms, this is usually referred to as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**: These are the expenses related to running the administrative side of the business. They are commonly listed as \"Administrative Expenses\" in the income statement.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Income Statement\n\nLet's look at the provided income statement and map these definitions to the line items:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 775598.77 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Total Revenue | 775598.77 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 496220.00 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Total Cost | 496220.00 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Gross Profit | 279378.77 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 14043.00 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Selling Expenses | 10967.95 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Depreciation | 115511.91 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Financial Expenses | 438.86 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Total Expenses | 140961.72 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Interest Income | 12737.96 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 151155.01 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Tax Expense | 38779.91 | 2024-02-02 |\n| Net Profit | 112375.10 | 2024-02-02 |\n\n### Identifying the Required Line Items\n\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**:\n   - Both \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\" are listed with the same amount (775598.77). \n   - Typically, \"Total Revenue\" is the comprehensive term that includes all revenue from ordinary activities, so we'll use that.\n   - **Value1**: 775598.77\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**:\n   - This is the \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n   - The amount is 496220.00.\n   - **Value2**: 496220.00\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**:\n   - This is \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n   - The amount is 14043.00.\n   - **Value3**: 14043.00\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example to ensure consistency:\n\n- **Example Input** had:\n  - Total Revenue: 5431018.59 (value1)\n  - Cost of Goods Sold: 4410000.00 (value2)\n  - Administrative Expenses: 1425164.20 (value3)\n\nThis matches our understanding, confirming that we're on the right track.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully mapping each required item to the given income statement, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '775598.77', 'value2': '496220.00', 'value3': '14043.00'} }\n```",
