This typically refers to \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet, as it represents the amounts owed to suppliers or vendors for credit purchases.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item that represents amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit is \"Accounts Payable\". This is a liability account that records the company's obligation to pay off short-term debts to its creditors or suppliers.\n\n2. **Locate the Initial and End Values**:\n   - In the given balance sheet, the \"Accounts Payable\" line item has:\n     - **Initial_amount**: 0.00 (as of the Initial_date: 2023-12-31)\n     - **End_amount**: 7566370.00 (as of the End_date: 2024-02-02)\n\n3. **Verify the Context**:\n   - The task specifically asks for amounts owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit, which aligns perfectly with \"Accounts Payable\". No other line items (e.g., Taxes Payable) fit this description.\n\n4. **Extract the Values**:\n   - The initial value is \"0.00\" (from Initial_amount).\n   - The end value is \"7566370.00\" (from End_amount).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '7566370.00'} }\n```",
