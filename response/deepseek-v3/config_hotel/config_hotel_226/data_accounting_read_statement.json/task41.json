In cash flow statements, this is typically labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: Looking at the provided cash flow statement, we can see the following line items under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\":\n   - Net Profit\n   - Depreciation\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\n   - **Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable**\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" directly corresponds to the increase in tax accrued but not yet paid. The value associated with this line item is **38779.91**.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The value is positive, indicating an increase in tax payable (i.e., tax accrued but not yet paid). This aligns with the task's requirement.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '38779.91'}}\n```",
