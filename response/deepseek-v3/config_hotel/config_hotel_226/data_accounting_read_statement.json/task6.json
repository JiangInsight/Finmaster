These items are typically categorized under \"Fixed Assets\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line item that represents tangible assets held for use in production, rental, or administrative purposes is \"Fixed Assets\". This is because fixed assets include property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) which are used in operations.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of the fixed assets is provided in the \"Initial_amount\" column for the \"Fixed Assets\" row. \n   - From the table: `Fixed Assets | 8000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 9213417.20 | 2024-02-02`\n   - The initial value is `8000000.00`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of the fixed assets is provided in the \"End_amount\" column for the \"Fixed Assets\" row.\n   - From the table: The end value is `9213417.20`.\n\n4. **Verify Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item shows the depreciation charged on the fixed assets. However, the net value of fixed assets is already reflected in the \"Fixed Assets\" line (after accounting for depreciation). Thus, we do not need to adjust the values further.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '9213417.20'} }\n```",
