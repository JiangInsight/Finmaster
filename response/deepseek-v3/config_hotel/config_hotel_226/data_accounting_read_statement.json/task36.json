This line item is typically labeled as \"Net Profit\" in the cash flow statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task asks for the profit after all expenses, which is the net profit. This is distinct from other line items like operating cash flow or net cash flow from operating activities.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, look for the line item labeled \"Net Profit\".\n3. **Extract the Value**: Once located, extract the corresponding amount associated with \"Net Profit\".\n\n### Application to the Given Problem:\n- In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"Net Profit\" has an amount of `112375.10` for the date `2024-02-02`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '112375.10'} }\n```",
