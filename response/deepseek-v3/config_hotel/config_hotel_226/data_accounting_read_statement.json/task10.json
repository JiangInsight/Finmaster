This is typically listed under \"Paid-in Capital\" or a similar account in the balance sheet. \n\nFrom the given balance sheet, we can see the following line items under the \"Owner's Equity\" section:\n- Paid-in Capital: Initial_amount = 16000000.00, End_amount = 16000000.00\n- Retained Earnings: Initial_amount = 0.00, End_amount = 112375.10\n- Total Owner's Equity: Initial_amount = 16000000.00, End_amount = 16112375.10\n\nThe \"Paid-in Capital\" line item directly represents the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares. The initial and end values for this line item are both 16000000.00, indicating no change in the paid-in capital during the period.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '16000000.00', 'end value': '16000000.00'} }\n```",
