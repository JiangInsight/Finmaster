I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the required information.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe have three financial statements provided:\n1. **Balance Sheet**\n2. **Income Statement**\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**\n\nWe need to extract two specific pieces of information:\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received**: This is typically found as \"Interest Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n2. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is usually the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents from the cash flow statement.\n\nThe order to present these is:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nBut since we're only extracting two values, and based on the example, it seems:\n- 'value1' is the \"Interest Receivable\" from the Balance Sheet.\n- 'value2' is the \"Net Increase\" from the Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### Extracting the First Value: Interest Accrued but Not Yet Received\n\nLooking at the **Balance Sheet**, we search for \"Interest Receivable\":\n```\nInterest Receivable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 12737.96 | 2024-02-02 |\n```\nThe \"End_amount\" is `12737.96`. This is the interest that has been accrued but not yet received by the end of the period.\n\n### Extracting the Second Value: Net Addition in Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nNow, looking at the **Cash Flow Statement**, we search for \"Net Increase\":\n```\nNet Increase  | -2180564.22 | 2024-02-02 |\n```\nThis shows that there was a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents by `-2180564.22` during the period.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nIn the provided example:\n- 'value1' was \"Interest Receivable\" from the Balance Sheet (`2672.87`).\n- 'value2' was \"Net Increase\" from the Cash Flow Statement (`-7565348.53`).\n\nThis matches our approach.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together:\n- 'value1': `12737.96` (Interest Receivable from Balance Sheet)\n- 'value2': `-2180564.22` (Net Increase from Cash Flow Statement)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '12737.96', 'value2': '-2180564.22'} }\n```",
