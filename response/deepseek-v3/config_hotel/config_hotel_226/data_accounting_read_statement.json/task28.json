The tax-related line item is typically labeled as \"Tax Expense\" or something similar.\n2. **Locate the Tax Line Item**: In the provided income statement, we can see a line item labeled \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of \"38779.91\" dated \"2024-02-02\".\n3. **Verify the Context**: The \"Tax Expense\" line item appears after \"Profit Before Tax\" and before \"Net Profit\", which is the standard placement for tax expenses in an income statement. This confirms that it is the correct line item representing the tax amount for the reporting period.\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Tax Expense\" is \"38779.91\", which is the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '38779.91'} }\n```",
