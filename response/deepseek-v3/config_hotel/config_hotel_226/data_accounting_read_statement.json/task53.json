This line item represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate the Income Statement**: The income statement provides details about revenues, expenses, and profits.\n2. **Identify the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: COGS is the direct cost attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company. This includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the good, and it excludes indirect expenses such as distribution costs and sales force costs.\n3. **Extract the Value**: In the provided income statement, the value for \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is `496220.00`.\n\nThus, the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is `496220.00`.\n\nThe solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '496220.00'}}\n```",
