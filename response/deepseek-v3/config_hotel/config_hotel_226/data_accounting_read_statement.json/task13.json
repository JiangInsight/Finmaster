These are typically the non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets and are not meant for short-term use or sale.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Non-Current Assets**: \n   - Non-current assets are assets that are not expected to be converted into cash or used up within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually longer than one year). \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Total Non-current Assets\" represent these assets.\n\n2. **Locate Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Non-current Assets\" is provided as \"8000000.00\" on the \"Initial_date\" of \"2023-12-31\".\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Non-current Assets\" is provided as \"9097905.29\" on the \"End_date\" of \"2024-02-02\".\n\n3. **Verify the Line Items**:\n   - The \"Total Non-current Assets\" is composed of \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation\". \n   - The initial value of \"Fixed Assets\" is \"8000000.00\", and the end value is \"9213417.20\". \n   - The initial value of \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is \"0.00\", and the end value is \"115511.91\". \n   - The net value of non-current assets at the end is calculated as \"Fixed Assets\" minus \"Accumulated Depreciation\", which is \"9213417.20 - 115511.91 = 9097905.29\", matching the \"Total Non-current Assets\" end value.\n\n4. **Exclude Current Assets**:\n   - Current assets (like Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Accounts Receivable, Inventory) are intended for sale or consumption within the operating cycle and are not included in the solution.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '9097905.29'}}\n```",
