The four line items are:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**: This typically refers to \"Selling Expenses\".\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This typically refers to \"Financial Expenses\".\n3. **The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This typically refers to \"Depreciation\".\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period**: This typically refers to \"Tax Expense\".\n\nNow, let's locate these line items in the given income statement and extract their values:\n\n1. **Selling Expenses**: The value is `10967.95`.\n2. **Depreciation**: The value is `115511.91`.\n3. **Financial Expenses**: The value is `438.86`.\n4. **Tax Expense**: The value is `38779.91`.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '10967.95', 'value2': '115511.91', 'value3': '438.86', 'value4': '38779.91'} }\n```",
