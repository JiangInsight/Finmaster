This is typically reflected in the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" line item in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task is to find the line item that shows the increase in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit. This is represented by \"Accounts Payable\" in the cash flow statement.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, look for the line item labeled \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with this line item is the amount by which the accounts payable have increased during the period. A positive value indicates an increase (addition) in the amount owed, while a negative value would indicate a decrease.\n4. **Verify the Line Item**: In the given problem, the line item is \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with a value of \"7566370.00\". This is a positive value, indicating an increase in the amount owed.\n\n### Solution:\nThe value representing the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is \"7566370.00\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '7566370.00'}}\n```",
