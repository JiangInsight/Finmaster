                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement extraction task step by step. I'm going to go through each part of the problem to identify and extract the three specific line items as described.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific values from the financial statements provided:\n\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under \"Paid-in Capital\" or similar.\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is usually the \"Profit Before Tax\" line in the Income Statement.\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This refers to the increase in \"Accounts Payable,\" which can be found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\"\n\nThe order of extraction is:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n### Given Financial Statements\nLet's look at each statement one by one.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, we have:\n- **Paid-in Capital**: Initial_amount = 16000000.00, End_amount = 16000000.00\n  - This represents the capital contributed by shareholders. The value we're interested in is the \"End_amount\" which is **16000000.00**.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- **Profit Before Tax**: Amount = 151155.01\n  - This is the profit or loss before tax expense. The value here is **151155.01**.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nIn the Cash Flow Statement:\n- **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: Amount = 7566370.00\n  - This shows the addition in the amount owed by the entity (increase in accounts payable). The value is **7566370.00**.\n\n### Verifying the Values\nLet me double-check each to ensure accuracy:\n1. **Paid-in Capital**: Yes, it's under \"Balance Sheet\" with End_amount = 16000000.00.\n2. **Profit Before Tax**: Confirmed in \"Income Statement\" as 151155.01.\n3. **Increase in Accounts Payable**: Correctly listed in \"Cash Flow Statement\" as 7566370.00.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16000000.00', 'value2': '151155.01', 'value3': '7566370.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. **Balance Sheet**:\n   - Located \"Paid-in Capital\" → End_amount = 16000000.00 → value1.\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - Located \"Profit Before Tax\" → 151155.01 → value2.\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - Located \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" → 7566370.00 → value3.\n4. Combined these into the JSON format as specified.\n\nThis matches the example provided where the values were extracted in the same order from their respective statements.",
