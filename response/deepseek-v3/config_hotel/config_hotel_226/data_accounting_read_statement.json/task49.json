                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through the cash flow statement provided and identify the three specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nFirst, let's recap what we're supposed to extract:\n\n1. **The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This typically refers to \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" because accounts payable represent amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit.\n   \n2. **Acquisition of property, plant and equipment**: This is usually listed as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the cash flow statement under investing activities.\n   \n3. **Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period**: This is the \"Beginning Balance\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Cash Flow Statement\n\nNow, let's look at the given cash flow statement and find these items.\n\n#### 1. Increase in Accounts Payable\n\nLooking under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\", we see:\n- \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with an amount of \"7566370.00\".\n\nThis matches our first item. So, `value1` should be \"7566370.00\".\n\n#### 2. Purchase of Fixed Assets\n\nUnder \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\", we find:\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an amount of \"1213417.20\".\n\nThis is our second item. So, `value2` should be \"1213417.20\".\n\n#### 3. Cash and Cash Equivalents at Beginning of Period\n\nUnder \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\", we see:\n- \"Beginning Balance\" with an amount of \"8000000.00\".\n\nThis is our third item. So, `value3` should be \"8000000.00\".\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nJust to ensure I'm on the right track, let's look at the provided example:\n\n- `value1` was \"1590000.00\", which corresponds to \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n- `value2` was \"305354.43\", matching \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n- `value3` was \"8000000.00\", matching \"Beginning Balance\".\n\nThis aligns perfectly with our approach, so I'm confident in proceeding similarly with the given problem.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter identifying all three required values from the cash flow statement, here's the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '7566370.00', 'value2': '1213417.20', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
