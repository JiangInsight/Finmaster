This is typically represented by the \"Depreciation\" line item in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: \n   - In the balance sheet, \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is listed under \"Fixed Assets\" with an end amount of \"115511.91\".\n   - In the cash flow statement, \"Depreciation\" is listed under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" with an amount of \"115511.91\".\n   - In the income statement, \"Depreciation\" is listed under \"Total Expenses\" with an amount of \"115511.91\".\n\n2. **Consistency Check**:\n   - All three statements (balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) report the same depreciation value of \"115511.91\", confirming its accuracy.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life is represented by the depreciation value of \"115511.91\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '115511.91'}}\n```",
