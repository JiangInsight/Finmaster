                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio to understand how to compute them based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Liabilities (End_amount for Total Current Liabilities): 7,605,149.91\n- Total Assets (End_amount for Total Assets): 23,717,525.01\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{7,605,149.91}{23,717,525.01} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{7,605,149.91}{23,717,525.01} \\approx 0.3206 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.32\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the ratio was given as a string with two decimal places, so we'll represent it similarly.\n\n**Debt to Asset Ratio:** '0.32'\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operating activities to the net income, indicating how much cash is generated per dollar of net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -967,147.02\n- Net Profit (from Income Statement): 112,375.10\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{-967,147.02}{112,375.10} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-967,147.02}{112,375.10} \\approx -8.606 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: -8.61\n\nAgain, representing it as a string with two decimal places.\n\n**Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:** '-8.61'\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nIn the provided example:\n- Debt to Asset Ratio was '0.14', which is Total Current Liabilities / Total Assets = 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.14.\n- Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio was '4.41', which is Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit = -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41 (negative divided by negative gives positive).\n\nOur calculations follow the same method, just with different numbers leading to different ratios.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.32', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-8.61'} }\n```",
