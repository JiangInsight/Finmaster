                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three key financial ratios: Return on Equity (ROE), Debt to Asset Ratio, and Gross Profit Margin. I'll go through each one, explaining how to compute them based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Return on Equity (ROE)\n\n**Definition:** ROE measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Shareholder's Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the **income statement**, the **Net Profit** is **112,375.10**.\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**, under **Total Owner's Equity**, the **End_amount** is **16,112,375.10**.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that. The balance sheet shows:\n\n- Paid-in Capital: 16,000,000.00\n- Retained Earnings: 112,375.10\n- Total Owner's Equity: 16,112,375.10\n\nSo, Shareholder's Equity is indeed 16,112,375.10.\n\nNow, calculate ROE:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{112,375.10}{16,112,375.10} \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\n\\[ \\frac{112,375.10}{16,112,375.10} \\approx 0.006974 \\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.006974 \\times 100 \\approx 0.6974\\% \\]\n\nSo, ROE is approximately **0.70%**.\n\n### 2. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio indicates the proportion of a company's assets that are financed through debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount)**: 7,605,149.91\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91\n- **Total Assets (End_amount)**: 23,717,525.01\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{7,605,149.91}{23,717,525.01} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{7,605,149.91}{23,717,525.01} \\approx 0.3206 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately **0.32**.\n\n### 3. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- **Gross Profit**: 279,378.77\n- **Total Revenue**: 775,598.77\n\nNow, calculate the margin:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{279,378.77}{775,598.77} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{279,378.77}{775,598.77} \\approx 0.3602 \\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100:\n\n\\[ 0.3602 \\times 100 \\approx 36.02\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **36.02%**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.70%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.32', 'Gross Profit Margin': '36.02%'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **ROE**:\n   - Net Profit: 112,375.10\n   - Equity: 16,112,375.10\n   - 112,375.10 / 16,112,375.10 ≈ 0.006974 → 0.70% ✔\n\n2. **Debt to Asset Ratio**:\n   - Total Liabilities: 7,605,149.91\n   - Total Assets: 23,717,525.01\n   - 7,605,149.91 / 23,717,525.01 ≈ 0.3206 → 0.32 ✔\n\n3. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit: 279,378.77\n   - Revenue: 775,598.77\n   - 279,378.77 / 775,598.77 ≈ 0.3602 → 36.02% ✔\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **ROE**: A 0.70% ROE is quite low, indicating that the company is not generating much profit relative to its equity. This could be due to high expenses or low revenues.\n  \n- **Debt to Asset Ratio**: 0.32 means that 32% of the company's assets are financed by debt, which is a moderate level. It's not overly leveraged, but there is some debt present.\n  \n- **Gross Profit Margin**: 36.02% is a healthy margin, indicating that the company retains a good portion of revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This suggests that the core operations are profitable, but other expenses might be eating into the net profit.\n\n### Final JSON\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.70%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.32', 'Gross Profit Margin': '36.02%'} }\n```",
