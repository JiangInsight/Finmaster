                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two things: the Free Cash Flow (FCF) and the Current Assets Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\n1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** This is the cash a company generates after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and maintain its capital assets. It's an important measure because it shows how efficient a company is at generating cash. There are different ways to calculate FCF, but one common method is:\n\n   FCF = Net Cash from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures (CapEx)\n\n   From the cash flow statement, \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" and \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" (which is CapEx) are given.\n\n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales. The formula is:\n\n   Current Assets Turnover Ratio = Net Sales / Average Current Assets\n\n   - Net Sales can be taken from the income statement as \"Total Revenue.\"\n   - Average Current Assets is the average of the beginning and ending current assets from the balance sheet.\n\n### Given Data\n\nLet's extract the necessary numbers from the provided financial statements.\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- Initial Current Assets (2023-12-31): 8,000,000.00\n- End Current Assets (2024-02-02): 14,619,619.72\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -967,147.02\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (CapEx): 1,213,417.20\n- Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents: -2,180,564.22\n\n**From the Income Statement:**\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales): 775,598.77\n\n### Calculating Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n\nUsing the formula:\nFCF = Net Cash from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\nFCF = -967,147.02 - 1,213,417.20\nFCF = -2,180,564.22\n\nWait a minute, this matches the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents at the bottom of the cash flow statement, which is -2,180,564.22. \n\nBut let's double-check the definition. Sometimes FCF is calculated as Operating Cash Flow minus CapEx, which gives us -2,180,564.22, but the net increase in cash is also the same. Maybe in this context, FCF is directly the net increase in cash and cash equivalents, which is -2,180,564.22.\n\nLooking back at the example provided in the task:\nIn the example, FCF was given as the \"Net Increase\" from the cash flow statement (-7,565,348.53), which matches the calculation of Operating Cash Flow (-7,259,994.10) minus Investing Cash Flow (-305,354.43), summing to -7,565,348.53.\n\nSimilarly, here:\nOperating Cash Flow: -967,147.02\nInvesting Cash Flow: -1,213,417.20\nTotal Net Cash Flow: -2,180,564.22\n\nSo, FCF is indeed -2,180,564.22.\n\n### Calculating Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\nFormula:\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = Net Sales / Average Current Assets\n\nFirst, calculate Average Current Assets:\nAverage Current Assets = (Beginning Current Assets + Ending Current Assets) / 2\n= (8,000,000.00 + 14,619,619.72) / 2\n= (22,619,619.72) / 2\n= 11,309,809.86\n\nNow, Net Sales = Total Revenue = 775,598.77\n\nSo,\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = 775,598.77 / 11,309,809.86\n≈ 0.06857\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.07\n\nBut let's check the example:\nIn the example, Total Revenue was 5,431,018.59, and Average Current Assets was (8,000,000 + 7,956,806.47)/2 ≈ 7,978,403.235\nRatio was 5,431,018.59 / 7,978,403.235 ≈ 0.68, which matches the given solution.\n\nHere, our calculation gives ≈ 0.07, which seems low. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, in the example, the initial current assets were 8,000,000, and end was 7,956,806.47, so average was slightly less than initial.\n\nHere, initial is 8,000,000, end is 14,619,619.72, so average is higher, and sales are much lower (775,598.77 vs 5,431,018.59), so the ratio being lower makes sense.\n\nSo, 0.07 seems correct.\n\nBut the example had 0.68 with higher sales and similar current assets, so maybe the ratio is supposed to be higher. Maybe I misapplied the formula.\n\nWait, is \"Net Sales\" the same as \"Total Revenue\"? Yes, in the income statement, \"Total Revenue\" is the top-line sales figure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is calculated using only ending current assets, not average. Sometimes ratios use ending balances.\n\nIf we use ending current assets:\n= 775,598.77 / 14,619,619.72 ≈ 0.053\n\nThat's even lower. Maybe the initial approach is correct.\n\nGiven that, sticking with average, the ratio is approximately 0.07.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-2180564.22', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.07'}}\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the FCF was the net increase in cash, which matches our calculation. The current assets turnover ratio seems correct based on the numbers, even though it's low compared to the example, the numbers are different.\n\nSo, confirming:\n\nFCF: -2,180,564.22 (from net increase in cash)\nCurrent Assets Turnover: 775,598.77 / ((8,000,000 + 14,619,619.72)/2) ≈ 0.07\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-2180564.22', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.07'}}\n```",
