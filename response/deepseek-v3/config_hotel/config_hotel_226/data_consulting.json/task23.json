                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement analysis step by step. We need to calculate two key ratios: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio. \n\n### 1. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:**  \nGross Profit Margin is a profitability ratio that shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n**Given Data (from Income Statement):**\n- Main Business Revenue (Total Revenue) = \\$775,598.77\n- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = \\$496,220.00\n- Gross Profit = \\$279,378.77\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{279,378.77}{775,598.77} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{279,378.77}{775,598.77} \\approx 0.3602 \\]\n\\[ 0.3602 \\times 100 \\approx 36.02\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **36.02%**.\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n**Definition:**  \nThis ratio measures a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\n**Understanding Total Debt:**  \nFrom the balance sheet, \"Total Current Liabilities\" is given as \\$7,605,149.91. Assuming this represents the total debt (since no long-term liabilities are provided), we'll use this as the total debt.\n\n**Given Data (from Cash Flow Statement):**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -\\$967,147.02\n- Total Current Liabilities (Total Debt) = \\$7,605,149.91\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-967,147.02}{7,605,149.91} \\]\n\nLet's compute this:\n\\[ \\frac{-967,147.02}{7,605,149.91} \\approx -0.127 \\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-0.13**.\n\n### Verifying the Approach\n\nBefore finalizing, let's ensure that using \"Total Current Liabilities\" as \"Total Debt\" is appropriate. Typically, total debt includes both current and long-term liabilities. However, in the provided balance sheet, there are no long-term liabilities listed under liabilities; only \"Total Current Liabilities\" is present under liabilities, and the rest is equity. Therefore, it's reasonable to consider \"Total Current Liabilities\" as the total debt in this context.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining both calculations:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '36.02%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.13'} }\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided in the task, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio was given with two decimal places without a percentage sign, and the Gross Profit Margin was given with two decimal places with a percentage sign. Following that format:\n\n- Gross Profit Margin: 36.02%\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: -0.13\n\nSo, the final formatted answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '36.02%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.13'} }\n```",
