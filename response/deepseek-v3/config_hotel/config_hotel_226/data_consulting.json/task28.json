                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Asset Ratio, the Gross Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. \n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 7,605,149.91\n- **Total Non-current Liabilities:** Not provided explicitly, but since \"Total Current Liabilities\" is the only liability listed under liabilities, we can assume that's the total liabilities unless there are other liabilities mentioned elsewhere. Looking at the balance sheet, under liabilities, only \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\" are listed, summing up to \"Total Current Liabilities.\" There's no mention of long-term debt or other non-current liabilities. So, Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91\n- **Total Assets (End_amount):** 23,717,525.01\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{7,605,149.91}{23,717,525.01} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n7,605,149.91 ÷ 23,717,525.01 ≈ 0.3206\n\nSo, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.32 or 32%. But looking at the example, it's presented as a decimal, so we'll keep it as 0.32.\n\nWait a minute, in the example, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated as Total Current Liabilities / Total Assets, even though there might be other liabilities. Here, since only current liabilities are provided, we'll proceed with that.\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 279,378.77\n- **Total Revenue:** 775,598.77\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{279,378.77}{775,598.77} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n279,378.77 ÷ 775,598.77 ≈ 0.3602\n\nThen multiply by 100%:\n0.3602 × 100 ≈ 36.02%\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately 36.02%.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -967,147.02\n- **Total Current Liabilities (from balance sheet):** 7,605,149.91\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-967,147.02}{7,605,149.91} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n-967,147.02 ÷ 7,605,149.91 ≈ -0.1272\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately -0.13.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios:\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.32 (or 32%, but the example had it as a decimal, so we'll stick with 0.32)\n- Gross Profit Margin: 36.02% (rounded to two decimal places as in the example)\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -0.13 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the ratios were presented with two decimal places for Debt to Asset and Operating Cash Flow, and Gross Profit Margin was a percentage with two decimal places. So, we'll format similarly.\n\nBut the example had:\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: '0.14' (as a string)\n- Gross Profit Margin: '18.80%' (as a string with %)\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: '-3.90' (as a string)\n\nSo, similarly:\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: '0.32'\n- Gross Profit Margin: '36.02%'\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: '-0.13'\n\nBut let's check the calculations again for any mistakes.\n\n**Rechecking Debt to Asset Ratio:**\nTotal Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91\nTotal Assets = 23,717,525.01\n7,605,149.91 / 23,717,525.01 ≈ 0.3206 → '0.32'\n\n**Rechecking Gross Profit Margin:**\n279,378.77 / 775,598.77 ≈ 0.3602 → '36.02%'\n\n**Rechecking Operating Cash Flow Ratio:**\n-967,147.02 / 7,605,149.91 ≈ -0.1272 → '-0.13'\n\nEverything seems correct.\n\n### Final JSON\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.32', 'Gross Profit Margin': '36.02%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.13'}}\n```",
