                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested metrics based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nFree Cash Flow is typically calculated as:\n**FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures**\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -967,147.02\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities (which includes Purchase of Fixed Assets): -1,213,417.20\n\nBut looking at the example, it seems they used the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents as FCF, which is -2,180,564.22. This might be a simplified approach where FCF is the net change in cash position.\n\nSo, **FCF = -2,180,564.22**\n\n### 2. Return on Assets (ROA)\nROA is calculated as:\n**ROA = Net Income / Average Total Assets**\n\nFirst, find average total assets:\n- Initial Total Assets: 16,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets: 23,717,525.01\n- Average = (16,000,000 + 23,717,525.01) / 2 = 19,858,762.505\n\nNet Income: 112,375.10\n\nROA = 112,375.10 / 19,858,762.505 ≈ 0.00566 or 0.566%\n\nBut the example showed ROA as a percentage, so let's multiply by 100:\n**ROA = 0.57%**\n\n### 3. Return on Equity (ROE)\nROE is calculated as:\n**ROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity**\n\nAverage Equity:\n- Initial Equity: 16,000,000.00\n- End Equity: 16,112,375.10\n- Average = (16,000,000 + 16,112,375.10) / 2 = 16,056,187.55\n\nNet Income: 112,375.10\n\nROE = 112,375.10 / 16,056,187.55 ≈ 0.007 or 0.7%\n\n**ROE = 0.70%**\n\n### 4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\nThis is:\n**Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Net Income**\n\nOperating Cash Flow: -967,147.02\nNet Income: 112,375.10\n\nRatio = -967,147.02 / 112,375.10 ≈ -8.61\n\n**Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = -8.61**\n\n### 5. Net Profit Margin\nNet Profit Margin is:\n**Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Total Revenue**\n\nNet Income: 112,375.10\nTotal Revenue: 775,598.77\n\nNet Profit Margin = 112,375.10 / 775,598.77 ≈ 0.1449 or 14.49%\n\n**Net Profit Margin = 14.49%**\n\n### 6. Gross Profit Margin\nGross Profit Margin is:\n**Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Total Revenue**\n\nGross Profit: 279,378.77\nTotal Revenue: 775,598.77\n\nGross Profit Margin = 279,378.77 / 775,598.77 ≈ 0.3602 or 36.02%\n\n**Gross Profit Margin = 36.02%**\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-2180564.22', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '0.57%', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.70%', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-8.61', 'Net Profit Margin': '14.49%', 'Gross Profit Margin': '36.02%'} }\n```\n\n### Verification:\nLet me double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **FCF**: Net Increase is indeed -2,180,564.22. Correct.\n2. **ROA**: \n   - Average Assets: (16,000,000 + 23,717,525.01)/2 = 19,858,762.505\n   - 112,375.10 / 19,858,762.505 ≈ 0.00566 → 0.57%. Correct.\n3. **ROE**:\n   - Average Equity: (16,000,000 + 16,112,375.10)/2 = 16,056,187.55\n   - 112,375.10 / 16,056,187.55 ≈ 0.007 → 0.70%. Correct.\n4. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income**:\n   - -967,147.02 / 112,375.10 ≈ -8.61. Correct.\n5. **Net Profit Margin**:\n   - 112,375.10 / 775,598.77 ≈ 14.49%. Correct.\n6. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - 279,378.77 / 775,598.77 ≈ 36.02%. Correct.\n\nEverything checks out!",
