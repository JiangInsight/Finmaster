                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Current Ratio as of the end of the reporting period based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Current Ratio\nFirst, I recall that the Current Ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations or those due within one year. The formula for the Current Ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nSo, to find the Current Ratio, I need two pieces of information from the balance sheet:\n1. Total Current Assets at the end of the reporting period.\n2. Total Current Liabilities at the end of the reporting period.\n\n### Identifying the Relevant Data from the Balance Sheet\nLooking at the provided balance sheet, I can see the following relevant lines:\n\n**Current Assets:**\n- Cash on Hand: 2,067,352.98\n- Bank Deposits: 3,752,082.80\n- Interest Receivable: 12,737.96\n- Accounts Receivable: 321,015.98\n- Inventory: 8,466,430.00\n- **Total Current Assets:** 14,619,619.72 (This is already given, which matches the sum of the individual current assets)\n\n**Current Liabilities:**\n- Accounts Payable: 7,566,370.00\n- Taxes Payable: 38,779.91\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 7,605,149.91 (Again, this is given and matches the sum of the individual current liabilities)\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\nNow, plugging these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{14,619,619.72}{7,605,149.91} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{14,619,619.72}{7,605,149.91} \\approx 1.922 \\]\n\nSo, the Current Ratio is approximately 1.92.\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nJust to ensure I didn't make a mistake, let's add up the current assets and liabilities manually:\n\n**Current Assets:**\n- Cash on Hand: 2,067,352.98\n- Bank Deposits: 3,752,082.80 = 2,067,352.98 + 3,752,082.80 = 5,819,435.78\n- Interest Receivable: 12,737.96 = 5,819,435.78 + 12,737.96 = 5,832,173.74\n- Accounts Receivable: 321,015.98 = 5,832,173.74 + 321,015.98 = 6,153,189.72\n- Inventory: 8,466,430.00 = 6,153,189.72 + 8,466,430.00 = 14,619,619.72\n\nThis matches the given Total Current Assets.\n\n**Current Liabilities:**\n- Accounts Payable: 7,566,370.00\n- Taxes Payable: 38,779.91 = 7,566,370.00 + 38,779.91 = 7,605,149.91\n\nThis matches the given Total Current Liabilities.\n\nThe division seems correct as well:\n14,619,619.72 ÷ 7,605,149.91 ≈ 1.922\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter carefully going through the numbers and verifying the calculations, the Current Ratio is approximately 1.92.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '1.92'}}\n```",
