                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Equity Ratio, the Net Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:**  \nThe Debt to Equity Ratio measures a company's financial leverage by comparing its total liabilities to its shareholders' equity.  \n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**  \n- Total Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91  \n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91  \n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,112,375.10  \n\n**Calculation:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = 7,605,149.91 / 16,112,375.10 ≈ 0.472  \n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:**  \nThe Net Profit Margin shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue.  \n**Formula:**  \nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\n**From the Income Statement:**  \n- Net Profit = 112,375.10  \n- Total Revenue = 775,598.77  \n\n**Calculation:**  \nNet Profit Margin = (112,375.10 / 775,598.77) * 100 ≈ 14.49%  \n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:**  \nThis ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations.  \n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**  \n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -967,147.02  \n- Total Current Liabilities (from Balance Sheet) = 7,605,149.91  \n\n**Calculation:**  \nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -967,147.02 / 7,605,149.91 ≈ -0.127  \n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.47', 'Net Profit Margin': '14.49%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.13'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**  \nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**  \n   7,605,149.91 / 16,112,375.10 ≈ 0.472 → Rounded to '0.47' (correct)\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**  \n   112,375.10 / 775,598.77 ≈ 0.1449 → 14.49% (correct)\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio:**  \n   -967,147.02 / 7,605,149.91 ≈ -0.127 → Rounded to '-0.13' (correct)\n\nEverything checks out! The ratios are calculated correctly based on the provided financial statements.",
