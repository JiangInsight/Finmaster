                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Current Ratio and the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: This measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its current assets. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: This shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n### Extracting Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n\n- **Total Current Assets (End_amount)**: 14,619,619.72\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount)**: 7,605,149.91\n- **Inventory (End_amount)**: 8,466,430.00\n- **Initial Inventory (Initial_amount)**: 0.00 (since Inventory starts at 0 on 2023-12-31)\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 496,220.00\n\n### Calculating Current Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{14,619,619.72}{7,605,149.91}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{14,619,619.72}{7,605,149.91} \\approx 1.922\n\\]\n\nSo, the Current Ratio is approximately **1.92**.\n\n### Calculating Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\nFirst, find the Average Inventory:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2} = \\frac{0 + 8,466,430}{2} = 4,233,215\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} = \\frac{496,220}{4,233,215}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{496,220}{4,233,215} \\approx 0.117\n\\]\n\nSo, the Inventory Turnover Ratio is approximately **0.12**.\n\n### Verifying Calculations\n\nWait a minute, the Inventory Turnover Ratio seems quite low (0.12). This would imply that the company is not turning over its inventory very quickly. Let me double-check the numbers:\n\n- COGS is 496,220.\n- Average Inventory is 4,233,215.\n- Ratio: 496,220 / 4,233,215 ≈ 0.117.\n\nThis seems correct based on the numbers provided. Maybe the company has a lot of inventory relative to its sales, or perhaps the period is short (from Dec 31 to Feb 2, about a month), which could explain the low turnover.\n\nAlternatively, if the inventory was zero at the beginning and 8,466,430 at the end, and the period is short, the average might not fully capture the turnover. Maybe using ending inventory is more appropriate in this case (some formulas use ending inventory instead of average when beginning is zero or not representative).\n\nLet me try with ending inventory only:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Ending Inventory}} = \\frac{496,220}{8,466,430} \\approx 0.0586\n\\]\n\nThis is even lower, which doesn't make sense. Maybe the initial inventory is not zero, but the table shows it as zero. Alternatively, perhaps the COGS is for the period, but the inventory buildup is recent.\n\nGiven that, sticking with the average seems more standard, even if it gives a low number. Maybe the example provided also had a low turnover, let me check:\n\nIn the example:\n- COGS: 4,410,000\n- Beginning Inventory: 0\n- Ending Inventory: 5,090,000\n- Average: (0 + 5,090,000)/2 = 2,545,000\n- Turnover: 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73\n\nOkay, so their turnover was higher because COGS was much higher relative to inventory. In our case, COGS is much lower relative to inventory, hence the low turnover.\n\nPerhaps the business is such that inventory builds up quickly but sales are slower, or the period is very short.\n\nGiven that, I think the calculation is correct, even if the number seems low.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating:\n\n- **Current Ratio**: 1.92\n- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: 0.12\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, their inventory turnover was based on average inventory, and their initial inventory was also zero, leading to a higher turnover because COGS was larger relative to inventory. In our case, COGS is small relative to inventory, leading to a low turnover.\n\nGiven that, unless there's a mistake in identifying the numbers, the ratios are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '1.92', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.12'} }\n```\n\nBut let me cross-check the numbers once more to ensure no misreading.\n\nFrom balance sheet:\n- Initial Inventory: 0.00\n- End Inventory: 8,466,430.00\n- COGS: 496,220.00\n\nAverage Inventory: (0 + 8,466,430)/2 = 4,233,215\nTurnover: 496,220 / 4,233,215 ≈ 0.117 ≈ 0.12\n\nCurrent Assets: 14,619,619.72\nCurrent Liabilities: 7,605,149.91\nCurrent Ratio: 14,619,619.72 / 7,605,149.91 ≈ 1.922 ≈ 1.92\n\nNo misreading, so the answer stands.\n\nHowever, the example had a much higher turnover with similar initial inventory zero, but their COGS was much higher (4,410,000 vs our 496,220), and ending inventory was lower (5,090,000 vs our 8,466,430), leading to higher turnover.\n\nGiven that, unless the period is different (example was Jan 30, this is Feb 2, both roughly a month), the low turnover seems correct based on data.\n\nThus, final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '1.92', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.12'} }\n```",
