                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio based on the given cash flow statement. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\" is. From what I gather, this ratio compares the cash generated from operating activities to the net income reported by the company. It's a measure of how well a company's net income translates into actual cash flow from operations.\n\nThe formula seems to be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit (Net Income)}} \\]\n\n### Identifying the Given Values\n\nFrom the provided data:\n\n- **Net Profit (Net Income)**: \\$112,375.10\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -\\$967,147.02\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nNow, plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-967,147.02}{112,375.10} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-967,147.02}{112,375.10} \\approx -8.606 \\]\n\nHmm, this gives a negative ratio, which seems unusual because in the example provided, the ratio was positive (4.41). \n\n### Checking the Example\n\nLooking back at the example:\n\n- Net Profit: -\\$1,645,141.43\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$7,259,994.10\n\nRatio calculated was 4.41. \n\nWait, if I do:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-7,259,994.10}{-1,645,141.43} \\approx 4.41 \\]\n\nAh, so both numbers were negative, resulting in a positive ratio. \n\nIn our current problem:\n\n- Net Profit: positive (\\$112,375.10)\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: negative (-\\$967,147.02)\n\nSo, a negative divided by a positive is negative. \n\nIs a negative ratio acceptable here? \n\n### Considering the Interpretation\n\nA negative ratio could indicate that even though the company has a positive net income, its operating cash flow is negative, which might suggest that the income isn't being converted into cash effectively, possibly due to increases in working capital (like increases in accounts receivable or inventory).\n\nGiven that, the negative ratio seems mathematically correct based on the numbers provided.\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nLet me double-check the calculation:\n\n\\[ -967,147.02 \\div 112,375.10 \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n967,147.02 ÷ 112,375.10 ≈ 8.606\n\nSo, -8.606\n\nRounding to two decimal places: -8.61\n\nBut the example had a ratio with two decimal places, so we'll present it similarly.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-8.61'}}\n```\n\n### Additional Thoughts\n\nIt's interesting that the ratio is negative here. This might imply that while the company is profitable on paper (positive net income), its operations are consuming cash, possibly due to significant investments in working capital (like increases in inventory or receivables). This could be a point of concern regarding the company's cash management. \n\nHowever, based purely on the calculation, the ratio is indeed -8.61.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-8.61'}}\n```",
