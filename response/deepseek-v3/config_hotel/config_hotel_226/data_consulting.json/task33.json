                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'll go through each ratio one by one, explaining how to calculate it based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operating activities. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -967,147.02\nFrom the balance sheet (End_amount):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-967,147.02}{7,605,149.91} \\approx -0.127 \\]\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the ability of a company to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nHere, \"Total Debt\" is essentially the total liabilities. From the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since there are no non-current liabilities listed) = 7,605,149.91\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-967,147.02}{7,605,149.91} \\approx -0.127 \\]\n\n*Note: This seems the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio because total debt equals current liabilities in this case.*\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 496,220.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00\n- Ending Inventory = 8,466,430.00\n- Average Inventory = (Initial + Ending) / 2 = (0 + 8,466,430) / 2 = 4,233,215.00\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{496,220.00}{4,233,215.00} \\approx 0.117 \\]\n\n*Wait a minute, this seems very low. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check if there's an initial inventory. The initial inventory is 0, and ending is 8,466,430. Maybe the company started with no inventory and ended with a lot, making the average high and turnover low. Alternatively, perhaps the initial inventory isn't zero, but the table shows it as zero. Maybe it's correct.*\n\nAlternatively, sometimes Inventory Turnover is calculated using only the ending inventory if beginning is zero or not meaningful:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{496,220.00}{8,466,430.00} \\approx 0.059 \\]\n\nThis seems even lower. Maybe the initial inventory is supposed to be considered as zero, and the company built up inventory during the period without selling much. Given the data, I'll stick with the first method (average inventory).\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} \\approx 0.12 \\]\n\nBut looking back at the example, their Inventory Turnover was 1.73 with COGS=4,410,000 and Inventory=5,090,000 (assuming ending inventory), which would be 4,410,000 / 5,090,000 ≈ 0.87, not matching their 1.73. Maybe they used average inventory where initial was 0, so average is 2,545,000, then 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73. So in our case, average is 4,233,215, so 496,220 / 4,233,215 ≈ 0.12.\n\nThis seems inconsistent with the example. Maybe the example used only ending inventory despite initial being zero. Let me re-calculate based on ending inventory:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{496,220}{8,466,430} \\approx 0.059 \\]\n\nThis seems too low. Maybe the initial inventory isn't zero, but the table shows it as zero. Given the data, I'll proceed with 0.12 using average inventory.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholder equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91\n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,112,375.10\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{7,605,149.91}{16,112,375.10} \\approx 0.472 \\]\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to meet short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand (End) = 2,067,352.98\n- Bank Deposits (End) = 3,752,082.80\n- Interest Receivable (End) = 12,737.96\n- Accounts Receivable (End) = 321,015.98\n- Total Quick Assets = 2,067,352.98 + 3,752,082.80 + 12,737.96 + 321,015.98 = 6,153,189.72\n- Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{6,153,189.72}{7,605,149.91} \\approx 0.809 \\]\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to pay short-term obligations with current assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End) = 14,619,619.72\n- Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{14,619,619.72}{7,605,149.91} \\approx 1.922 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.13', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.13', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.12', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.47', 'Quick Ratio': '0.81', 'Current Ratio': '1.92'}}\n```\n\n*Note: The Inventory Turnover Ratio seems unusually low, which might be due to the initial inventory being zero and a large ending inventory with relatively low COGS. If there's additional context or if initial inventory isn't actually zero, the ratio might need adjustment.*",
