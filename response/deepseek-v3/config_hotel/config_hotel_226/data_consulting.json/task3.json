There are no non-current liabilities listed, so the total liabilities are 7,605,149.91.\n\n3. **Identify Total Assets**: From the balance sheet, the \"Total Assets\" at the end of the reporting period (2024-02-02) is 23,717,525.01.\n\n4. **Calculate the Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{7,605,149.91}{23,717,525.01} \\approx 0.3206\n   \\]\n   Rounding to two decimal places, this is approximately 0.32.\n\n5. **Present the Solution**:\n   ```json\n   {\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.32'} }\n   ```",
