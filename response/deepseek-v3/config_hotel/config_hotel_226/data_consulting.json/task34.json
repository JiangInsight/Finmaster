                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand where each number comes from in the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -967,147.02\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91\n\nCalculation:\n= -967,147.02 / 7,605,149.91 ≈ -0.127\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91 (this is the only liability listed, assuming no long-term debt)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,112,375.10\n\nCalculation:\n= 7,605,149.91 / 16,112,375.10 ≈ 0.472\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 775,598.77\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Assets = 16,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets = 23,717,525.01\n- Average Total Assets = (Initial + End) / 2 = (16,000,000 + 23,717,525.01) / 2 ≈ 19,858,762.51\n\nCalculation:\n= 775,598.77 / 19,858,762.51 ≈ 0.039\n\n*Wait a minute, this seems very low compared to the example. Maybe I should use only the end total assets instead of average? Sometimes ratios use end-of-period figures. Let me check the example.*\n\nLooking back at the example:\n- Total Asset Turnover = 0.41\n- Their Total Revenue = 5,431,018.59\n- End Total Assets = 13,216,409.49\n- 5,431,018.59 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.41\n\nSo, it seems they used end total assets, not average. Let's adjust:\n\nUsing end total assets:\n= 775,598.77 / 23,717,525.01 ≈ 0.033\n\nStill very low. Maybe the revenue is for a shorter period? The dates are from 2023-12-31 to 2024-02-02, which is about a month. The example was from 2023-12-31 to 2024-01-30, also about a month, and their ratio was 0.41. Maybe the revenue here is unusually low compared to assets.\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 14,619,619.72\n- Inventory = 8,466,430.00\n- Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91\n\nCalculation:\n= (14,619,619.72 - 8,466,430.00) / 7,605,149.91\n= 6,153,189.72 / 7,605,149.91 ≈ 0.809\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nThis is the same as the first ratio:\n= -967,147.02 / 7,605,149.91 ≈ -0.127\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Income / Average Shareholder's Equity\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = 112,375.10\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Owner's Equity = 16,000,000.00\n- End Owner's Equity = 16,112,375.10\n- Average Equity = (16,000,000 + 16,112,375.10) / 2 ≈ 16,056,187.55\n\nCalculation:\n= 112,375.10 / 16,056,187.55 ≈ 0.007 or 0.7%\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since we don't have separate data for cash and credit sales):\n- Net Sales = 775,598.77\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00\n- End Accounts Receivable = 321,015.98\n- Average AR = (0 + 321,015.98) / 2 = 160,507.99\n\nCalculation:\n= 775,598.77 / 160,507.99 ≈ 4.83\n\n*But in the example, their Accounts Receivable Turnover was 4.47 with similar time frames, so this seems plausible.*\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the solution:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.13\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.47\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.03\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"0.81\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-0.13\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"0.70%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"4.83\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check some calculations:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities: -967,147 / 7,605,149 ≈ -0.127 → -0.13\n2. Debt to Equity: 7,605,149 / 16,112,375 ≈ 0.472 → 0.47\n3. Total Asset Turnover: 775,598 / 23,717,525 ≈ 0.0327 → 0.03\n4. Quick Ratio: (14,619,619 - 8,466,430) / 7,605,149 ≈ 6,153,189 / 7,605,149 ≈ 0.809 → 0.81\n5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio: Same as 1 → -0.13\n6. ROE: 112,375 / 16,056,187 ≈ 0.007 → 0.70%\n7. AR Turnover: 775,598 / 160,507 ≈ 4.83 → 4.83\n\nEverything checks out. The Total Asset Turnover is unusually low, but given the revenue is much smaller relative to assets compared to the example, it makes sense. Similarly, ROE is low because the net income is small relative to equity. Other ratios seem reasonable based on the data.",
