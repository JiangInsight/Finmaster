                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nFirst, what is the Debt to Equity Ratio? It's a financial ratio that compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholders' equity. It's used to measure a company's financial leverage and is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet, we can identify these components.\n\n### Identifying Total Liabilities\n\nLooking at the balance sheet provided, under the \"End_amount\" column, we have:\n\n- **Accounts Payable**: 7,566,370.00\n- **Taxes Payable**: 38,779.91\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 7,605,149.91\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any non-current liabilities listed (like long-term debt), so the **Total Liabilities** would just be the **Total Current Liabilities**, which is 7,605,149.91.\n\n### Identifying Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nUnder the \"End_amount\" column for equity:\n\n- **Paid-in Capital**: 16,000,000.00\n- **Retained Earnings**: 112,375.10\n- **Total Owner's Equity**: 16,112,375.10\n\nSo, the **Total Shareholders' Equity** is 16,112,375.10.\n\n### Calculating the Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} = \\frac{7,605,149.91}{16,112,375.10} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{7,605,149.91}{16,112,375.10} \\approx 0.472 \\]\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 0.47 when rounded to two decimal places.\n\n### Verifying the Numbers\n\nJust to ensure I didn't miss anything:\n\n- **Total Liabilities**: Only current liabilities are present, totaling 7,605,149.91.\n- **Total Equity**: Sum of paid-in capital and retained earnings is 16,112,375.10.\n  \nNo other liabilities or equity items are present, so the calculation seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.47.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.47'} }\n```",
