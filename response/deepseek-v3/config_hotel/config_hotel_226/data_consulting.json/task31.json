                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand where each number comes from in the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all Main Business Revenue is credit sales) = 775,598.77\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable (Initial_amount on 2023-12-31) = 0.00\n- Ending Accounts Receivable (End_amount on 2024-02-02) = 321,015.98\n\n**Average Accounts Receivable:**\n\\[ \\text{Average AR} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning AR} + \\text{Ending AR}}{2} = \\frac{0 + 321,015.98}{2} = 160,507.99 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{AR Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{775,598.77}{160,507.99} \\approx 4.83 \\]\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio was calculated as 4.47 with similar data. Maybe they used only Ending AR instead of Average AR since Beginning AR was 0. Let me check:\n\nIf we use only Ending AR:\n\\[ \\text{AR Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{775,598.77}{321,015.98} \\approx 2.42 \\]\n\nHmm, neither matches the example's approach. Maybe the example used Average AR even with Beginning AR as 0. I'll stick with Average AR for now unless specified otherwise.\n\n**Final:**\n\\[ \\text{AR Turnover Ratio} \\approx 4.83 \\]\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Operating Cash Flow (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) = -967,147.02\n- Current Liabilities (End_amount on 2024-02-02) = 7,605,149.91\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-967,147.02}{7,605,149.91} \\approx -0.127 \\]\n\n*In the example, it was -3.90, which seems to be Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities, same as here. Maybe a typo in the example? Or perhaps they used absolute values? Probably not. Maybe the example had a different calculation.*\n\n**Final:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} \\approx -0.127 \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis seems identical to the Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the example provided (both were -3.90 in the example). Maybe it's the same ratio with a different name.\n\n**Same as above:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} \\approx -0.127 \\]\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Sales}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Sales (Total Revenue) = 775,598.77\n- Beginning Total Assets = 16,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets = 23,717,525.01\n\n**Average Total Assets:**\n\\[ \\text{Average TA} = \\frac{16,000,000 + 23,717,525.01}{2} = \\frac{39,717,525.01}{2} = 19,858,762.505 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{775,598.77}{19,858,762.505} \\approx 0.039 \\]\n\n*In the example, it was 0.41, which seems higher. Maybe they used only Ending Total Assets:*\n\nIf using Ending Total Assets:\n\\[ \\frac{775,598.77}{23,717,525.01} \\approx 0.033 \\]\n\nStill not matching. Maybe the example had higher sales relative to assets. I'll stick with Average Total Assets unless specified.\n\n**Final:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} \\approx 0.039 \\]\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Total Liabilities (Total Current Liabilities, since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 7,605,149.91\n- Total Shareholders' Equity (Total Owner's Equity) = 16,112,375.10\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{7,605,149.91}{16,112,375.10} \\approx 0.472 \\]\n\n*In the example, it was 0.16, which is lower. Maybe they didn't include all liabilities or had higher equity. Here, it's straightforward.*\n\n**Final:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} \\approx 0.472 \\]\n\n### Verifying Against Example\n\nLooking back at the example:\n- AR Turnover: 4.47 (we got 4.83)\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -3.90 (we got -0.127)\n- Same for Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities\n- Total Asset Turnover: 0.41 (we got 0.039)\n- Debt to Equity: 0.16 (we got 0.472)\n\nOur numbers are quite different, possibly due to different scales or interpretations. Maybe the example used different methods (like only ending balances instead of averages). Given that, I'll proceed with the standard methods unless the problem specifies otherwise.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '4.83', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-0.13', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.13', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.04', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.47'}}\n```\n\n*Note: I rounded to two decimal places where applicable.*",
