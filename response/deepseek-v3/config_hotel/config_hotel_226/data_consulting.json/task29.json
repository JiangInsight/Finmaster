                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the four requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of debt a company uses to finance its assets relative to the equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities here) = 7,605,149.91\n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,112,375.10\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{7,605,149.91}{16,112,375.10} \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{7,605,149.91}{16,112,375.10} \\approx 0.472 \\]\n\nBut looking at the example, the ratio was rounded to two decimal places, so let's do the same:\n\n\\[ \\approx 0.47 \\]\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n**Definition:** This shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 112,375.10\n- Total Revenue = 775,598.77\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{112,375.10}{775,598.77} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{112,375.10}{775,598.77} \\approx 0.1449 \\]\n\\[ 0.1449 \\times 100 \\approx 14.49\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Definition:** This measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets = 23,717,525.01\n- Net Profit = 112,375.10\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\left( \\frac{112,375.10}{23,717,525.01} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{112,375.10}{23,717,525.01} \\approx 0.00474 \\]\n\\[ 0.00474 \\times 100 \\approx 0.474\\% \\]\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This measures how efficiently a company collects receivables from customers. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need the average accounts receivable. Since the initial amount is 0 (from the initial date), and the end amount is 321,015.98, the average is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{0 + 321,015.98}{2} = 160,507.99 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{775,598.77}{160,507.99} \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{775,598.77}{160,507.99} \\approx 4.832 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\n\\[ \\approx 4.83 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, compiling all these calculations into the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.47', 'Net Profit Margin': '14.49%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '0.47%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '4.83'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me quickly check if these numbers make sense:\n- Debt to Equity of 0.47 means the company has less debt than equity, which is generally good.\n- Net Profit Margin of ~14.5% is positive, indicating profitability.\n- ROA is low (~0.47%), meaning assets aren't generating much profit, which might be okay depending on the industry.\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover of ~4.83 means the company collects its receivables about 4.83 times a year, or roughly every 75 days (365/4.83), which might be a bit slow but depends on the industry norms.\n\nEverything seems to add up correctly based on the provided data.",
