                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios: the Quick Ratio and the Net Profit Margin. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):**\n   - This measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n   - Formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n     \\]\n   - **Quick Assets** typically include:\n     - Cash and cash equivalents\n     - Marketable securities\n     - Accounts receivable\n   - **Excludes** inventory because it's not as liquid.\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - This shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue.\n   - Formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n     \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the provided financial statements, let's extract the necessary information.\n\n#### Balance Sheet (End of Period - 2024-02-02)\n\n**Current Assets:**\n- Cash on Hand: 2,067,352.98\n- Bank Deposits: 3,752,082.80\n- Interest Receivable: 12,737.96\n- Accounts Receivable: 321,015.98\n- Inventory: 8,466,430.00\n\n**Current Liabilities:**\n- Accounts Payable: 7,566,370.00\n- Taxes Payable: 38,779.91\n- Total Current Liabilities: 7,605,149.91\n\n#### Income Statement\n\n- Total Revenue: 775,598.77\n- Net Profit: 112,375.10\n\n### Calculating Quick Ratio\n\n**Step 1: Identify Quick Assets**\nQuick assets are:\n- Cash on Hand\n- Bank Deposits\n- Interest Receivable\n- Accounts Receivable\n\n*Note:* Inventory is excluded from quick assets.\n\nSo,\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Assets} = \\text{Cash on Hand} + \\text{Bank Deposits} + \\text{Interest Receivable} + \\text{Accounts Receivable}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2,067,352.98 + 3,752,082.80 + 12,737.96 + 321,015.98\n\\]\n\nLet's add these up:\n- 2,067,352.98 + 3,752,082.80 = 5,819,435.78\n- 5,819,435.78 + 12,737.96 = 5,832,173.74\n- 5,832,173.74 + 321,015.98 = 6,153,189.72\n\n**Step 2: Identify Current Liabilities**\nTotal Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Quick Ratio**\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{6,153,189.72}{7,605,149.91}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{6,153,189.72}{7,605,149.91} \\approx 0.809\n\\]\n\nSo, Quick Ratio ≈ 0.81\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the Quick Ratio was given as '1.54'. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check what's considered as quick assets.\n\nRe-evaluating Quick Assets:\nTypically, quick assets are cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Interest receivable is also a current asset that's expected to be received within a year, so it's usually included. \n\nBut looking at the example:\nIn the example, quick assets were:\nCash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 270,005.90 + 164,645.57 + 2,672.87 + 2,429,482.13 = 2,866,806.47\nCurrent Liabilities = 1,861,550.92\nQuick Ratio = 2,866,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54\n\nSo, my initial approach seems correct based on the example. Maybe in this problem, the quick ratio is indeed lower.\n\nAlternatively, maybe bank deposits are not considered as cash equivalents? But usually, they are. \n\nGiven that, I think my calculation is correct: Quick Ratio ≈ 0.81\n\nBut let me cross-validate with another approach. Maybe the quick assets are only cash and accounts receivable, excluding interest receivable.\n\nThen:\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable\n= 2,067,352.98 + 3,752,082.80 + 321,015.98 = 6,140,451.76\nQuick Ratio = 6,140,451.76 / 7,605,149.91 ≈ 0.807 ≈ 0.81\n\nSame result. So, likely the quick ratio is 0.81.\n\nPerhaps the example had a higher ratio because their current liabilities were lower relative to quick assets.\n\n#### Net Profit Margin\n\nThis is straightforward.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{112,375.10}{775,598.77} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nCalculate the division first:\n112,375.10 / 775,598.77 ≈ 0.1449\n\nThen multiply by 100:\n0.1449 * 100 ≈ 14.49%\n\nSo, Net Profit Margin ≈ 14.49%\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating:\n\n- Quick Ratio: 0.81\n- Net Profit Margin: 14.49%\n\nExpressed in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '0.81', 'Net Profit Margin': '14.49%'} }\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the numbers were presented with two decimal places. Maybe we should round to two decimal places.\n\nQuick Ratio: 0.809 → 0.81\nNet Profit Margin: 0.1449 → 14.49%\n\nSo, it's already correctly rounded.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '0.81', 'Net Profit Margin': '14.49%'} }\n```",
