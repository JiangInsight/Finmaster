                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 14,619,619.72\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 7,605,149.91\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 14,619,619.72 / 7,605,149.91 ≈ 1.92\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand (End_amount) = 2,067,352.98\n- Bank Deposits (End_amount) = 3,752,082.80\n- Interest Receivable (End_amount) = 12,737.96\n- Accounts Receivable (End_amount) = 321,015.98\n- Total Current Liabilities = 7,605,149.91\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 2,067,352.98 + 3,752,082.80 + 12,737.96 + 321,015.98\n= 6,153,189.72\n\nQuick Ratio = 6,153,189.72 / 7,605,149.91 ≈ 0.81\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 7,605,149.91\n- Total Assets (End_amount) = 23,717,525.01\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 7,605,149.91 / 23,717,525.01 ≈ 0.32\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 7,605,149.91\n- Total Owner's Equity (End_amount) = 16,112,375.10\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 7,605,149.91 / 16,112,375.10 ≈ 0.47\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -967,147.02\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 7,605,149.91\n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -967,147.02 / 7,605,149.91 ≈ -0.13\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '1.92', 'Quick Ratio': '0.81', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.32', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.47', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.13'} }\n```\n\n### Verification:\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: 14,619,619.72 / 7,605,149.91 = 1.922 (matches)\n2. **Quick Ratio**: \n   - Quick Assets: 2,067,352.98 + 3,752,082.80 + 12,737.96 + 321,015.98 = 6,153,189.72\n   - Ratio: 6,153,189.72 / 7,605,149.91 = 0.809 (matches)\n3. **Debt to Asset Ratio**: 7,605,149.91 / 23,717,525.01 = 0.3206 (matches)\n4. **Debt to Equity Ratio**: 7,605,149.91 / 16,112,375.10 = 0.4719 (matches)\n5. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: -967,147.02 / 7,605,149.91 = -0.127 (matches)\n\nAll calculations check out!",
