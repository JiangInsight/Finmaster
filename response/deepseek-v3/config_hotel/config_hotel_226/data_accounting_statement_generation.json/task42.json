                        "content": "To calculate the \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" for the cash flow statement, we need to sum up all the tax amounts from the sales transactions where the payment/receipt_status is \"Paid\". This is because the cash flow statement reflects actual cash movements, and only paid transactions affect cash flow.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Identify all sales transactions with payment/receipt_status = \"Paid\"\n2. Sum their tax_amount values\n\nLooking at the transactions, here are the relevant sales with tax amounts:\n\nFrom the sales data:\n- Sale20240102002: tax_amount = 41.97\n- Sale20240102003: tax_amount = 23.0\n- Sale20240104005: tax_amount = 659.92\n- Sale20240104008: tax_amount = 53.55\n- Sale20240105010: tax_amount = 278.18\n- Sale20240105012: tax_amount = 10.57\n- Sale20240106016: tax_amount = 245.9\n- Sale20240107020: tax_amount = 103.46\n- Sale20240107021: tax_amount = 309.93\n- Sale20240107022: tax_amount = 401.0\n- Sale20240108025: tax_amount = 655.19\n- Sale20240108026: tax_amount = 673.52\n- Sale20240108027: tax_amount = 116.15\n- Sale20240109028: tax_amount = 292.35\n- Sale20240110031: tax_amount = 89.15\n- Sale20240110032: tax_amount = 143.73\n- Sale20240111033: tax_amount = 223.95\n- Sale20240111034: tax_amount = 498.89\n- Sale20240111035: tax_amount = 102.49\n- Sale20240112040: tax_amount = 480.34\n- Sale20240114043: tax_amount = 486.13\n- Sale20240115045: tax_amount = 694.15\n- Sale20240116048: tax_amount = 10.09\n- Sale20240116049: tax_amount = 88.74\n- Sale20240117051: tax_amount = 428.4\n- Sale20240117052: tax_amount = 793.61\n- Sale20240117053: tax_amount = 940.79\n- Sale20240118056: tax_amount = 58.95\n- Sale20240118057: tax_amount = 414.8\n- Sale20240118058: tax_amount = 1281.0\n- Sale20240118059: tax_amount = 339.84\n- Sale20240119062: tax_amount = 1600.01\n- Sale20240120064: tax_amount = 409.55\n- Sale20240121066: tax_amount = 1655.31\n- Sale20240121067: tax_amount = 39.38\n- Sale20240123071: tax_amount = 544.45\n- Sale20240123072: tax_amount = 145.1\n- Sale20240124074: tax_amount = 315.87\n- Sale20240124075: tax_amount = 337.27\n- Sale20240125076: tax_amount = 386.01\n- Sale20240125077: tax_amount = 1219.32\n- Sale20240126080: tax_amount = 375.1\n- Sale20240127084: tax_amount = 34.28\n- Sale20240128086: tax_amount = 653.98\n- Sale20240130092: tax_amount = 771.55\n- Sale20240130094: tax_amount = 857.87\n- Sale20240130095: tax_amount = 69.21\n- Sale20240131097: tax_amount = 964.46\n- Sale20240201101: tax_amount = 204.81\n- Sale20240202103: tax_amount = 774.08\n- Sale20240202104: tax_amount = 26.93\n\nNow, let's sum all these tax amounts:\n\nAdding them up gives us a total of 16,753.39.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '16753.39'}}\n```",
