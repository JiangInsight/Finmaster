Paid-in capital represents the amount of money that shareholders have invested in the company through the purchase of stock. \n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Transactions**: \n   - Look for transactions that represent initial capital injections. These are typically labeled as \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", or \"Fixed Assets\" with dates at the beginning of the period (e.g., 2023-12-31).\n   - Sum these amounts to get the initial paid-in capital.\n\n2. **Identify Final Transactions**:\n   - Paid-in capital typically does not change unless there are additional investments or withdrawals by shareholders. In the given data, there are no transactions indicating additional investments or withdrawals after the initial deposits.\n   - Therefore, the final paid-in capital should be the same as the initial paid-in capital.\n\n3. **Calculate Initial Paid-in Capital**:\n   - From the problem data, the initial transactions are:\n     - Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n     - Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n     - Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.0\n   - Sum: 3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 + 8,000,000.0 = 16,000,000.0\n\n4. **Final Paid-in Capital**:\n   - Since there are no additional investments or withdrawals, the final paid-in capital remains the same as the initial: 16,000,000.0.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Paid-in Capital Initial Value\": \"16000000.00\", \"Paid-in Capital End Value\": \"16000000.00\"}}\n```",
