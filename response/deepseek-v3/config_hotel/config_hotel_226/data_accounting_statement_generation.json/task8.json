These transactions represent the depreciation expenses recorded during the period.\n   - From the given data, there are two depreciation transactions:\n     - `Depreciation20240101001` with an amount of `45745.80` recorded on `2024-01-01`.\n     - `Depreciation20240201002` with an amount of `69766.11` recorded on `2024-02-01`.\n\n2. **Initial Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - The initial accumulated depreciation at the start of the period (before any depreciation expenses are recorded) is `0.00` because no prior depreciation is mentioned in the initial transactions.\n\n3. **Final Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - The final accumulated depreciation is the sum of all depreciation expenses recorded during the period.\n   - Sum of depreciation expenses: `45745.80 + 69766.11 = 115511.91`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"115511.91\"}}\n```",
