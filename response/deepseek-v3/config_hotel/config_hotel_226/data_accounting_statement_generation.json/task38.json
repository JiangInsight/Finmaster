                        "content": "To calculate the \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" for the cash flow statement, we need to identify all sales transactions where the payment/receipt_status is \"Unpaid\" and the receive_method is \"Account Receviable\". These transactions represent sales that have not yet been collected in cash, thus increasing accounts receivable.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Unpaid Sales Transactions:**\n   - Filter all transactions where:\n     - `type` is \"Sale\"\n     - `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\"\n     - `receive_method` is \"Account Receviable\"\n\n2. **Sum the After-Tax Amounts:**\n   - For each identified transaction, use the `after_tax_amount` field, which represents the amount that will be collected in the future (i.e., the increase in accounts receivable).\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Increase in Accounts Receivable:**\n   - Sum all the `after_tax_amount` values from the filtered transactions.\n\n4. **Present the Result:**\n   - The result is the total increase in accounts receivable, which should be reported as a negative value in the cash flow statement (since it represents cash not yet received).\n\n### Filtered Transactions and Calculations:\nFrom the given data, the unpaid sales transactions with \"Account Receviable\" are:\n\n1. Sale20240104006: after_tax_amount = 2525.51\n2. Sale20240104007: after_tax_amount = 21300.71\n3. Sale20240105011: after_tax_amount = 4342.96\n4. Sale20240105013: after_tax_amount = 193.13\n5. Sale20240106017: after_tax_amount = 1631.25\n6. Sale20240106018: after_tax_amount = 2186.76\n7. Sale20240107019: after_tax_amount = 1862.04\n8. Sale20240109029: after_tax_amount = 9752.59\n9. Sale20240110030: after_tax_amount = 19299.06\n10. Sale20240111036: after_tax_amount = 912.28\n11. Sale20240112038: after_tax_amount = 552.76\n12. Sale20240112039: after_tax_amount = 18796.75\n13. Sale20240113041: after_tax_amount = 19908.72\n14. Sale20240113042: after_tax_amount = 11121.93\n15. Sale20240114044: after_tax_amount = 548.96\n16. Sale20240115046: after_tax_amount = 9653.57\n17. Sale20240116047: after_tax_amount = 9039.89\n18. Sale20240116050: after_tax_amount = 2399.1\n19. Sale20240119061: after_tax_amount = 14522.97\n20. Sale20240119062: after_tax_amount = 30400.23 (Note: This is marked as \"Paid\" in the data, so it should not be included. This is likely a discrepancy in the data.)\n21. Sale20240120063: after_tax_amount = 4086.92\n22. Sale20240121068: after_tax_amount = 32172.7\n23. Sale20240122070: after_tax_amount = 13216.36\n24. Sale20240126079: after_tax_amount = 6690.76\n25. Sale20240126081: after_tax_amount = 2131.28\n26. Sale20240127085: after_tax_amount = 8679.35\n27. Sale20240129089: after_tax_amount = 14114.85\n28. Sale20240129090: after_tax_amount = 3832.85\n29. Sale20240129091: after_tax_amount = 6734.46\n30. Sale20240130093: after_tax_amount = 7444.18\n31. Sale20240131098: after_tax_amount = 33328.62\n32. Sale20240201100: after_tax_amount = 6772.59\n33. Sale20240201102: after_tax_amount = 9582.27\n\n(Note: Some transactions may be incorrectly labeled in the data, so we exclude Sale20240119062 as it is marked \"Paid\".)\n\n### Sum of After-Tax Amounts:\nAdding up the valid `after_tax_amount` values:\n2525.51 + 21300.71 + 4342.96 + 193.13 + 1631.25 + 2186.76 + 1862.04 + 9752.59 + 19299.06 + 912.28 + 552.76 + 18796.75 + 19908.72 + 11121.93 + 548.96 + 9653.57 + 9039.89 + 2399.1 + 14522.97 + 4086.92 + 32172.7 + 13216.36 + 6690.76 + 2131.28 + 8679.35 + 14114.85 + 3832.85 + 6734.46 + 7444.18 + 33328.62 + 6772.59 + 9582.27 = **318,018.07**\n\n### Final Calculation:\nThe total increase in accounts receivable is 318,018.07. In the cash flow statement, this is reported as a negative value (since it represents cash not yet received):\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-318018.07\"}}\n```",
