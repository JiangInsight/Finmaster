                        "content": "To calculate the net cash flow from operating activities, we need to consider all cash inflows and outflows related to operating activities. Operating activities typically include cash received from customers and cash paid to suppliers, employees, and for other operating expenses. \n\nHere's how we'll approach it:\n\n1. **Cash Inflows from Operating Activities**:\n   - Sum all cash received from sales where the payment method is \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" and the payment status is \"Paid\".\n\n2. **Cash Outflows from Operating Activities**:\n   - Sum all cash paid for purchases where the payment method is \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" and the payment status is \"Paid\".\n   - Sum all cash paid for expenses (Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Financial Expenses) where the payment method is \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" and the payment status is \"Paid\".\n\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**:\n   - Subtract the total cash outflows from the total cash inflows.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Cash Inflows from Sales**:\n   - Filter all \"Sale\" transactions where \"payment/receipt_status\" is \"Paid\" and \"payment_method\" is \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\".\n   - Sum the \"amount\" for these transactions.\n\n2. **Cash Outflows from Purchases**:\n   - Filter all \"Purchase\" transactions where \"payment/receipt_status\" is \"Paid\" and \"payment_method\" is \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\".\n   - Sum the \"amount\" for these transactions.\n\n3. **Cash Outflows from Expenses**:\n   - Filter all \"Expense\" transactions (Sales, Administrative, Financial) where \"payment/receipt_status\" is \"Paid\" and \"payment_method\" is \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\".\n   - Sum the \"amount\" for these transactions.\n\n4. **Net Cash Flow**:\n   - Net Cash Flow = (Cash Inflows from Sales) - (Cash Outflows from Purchases + Cash Outflows from Expenses).\n\n### Implementation:\n\nAfter reviewing the transactions:\n\n- **Cash Inflows from Sales**: Sum of all \"Sale\" transactions with \"Paid\" status and \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" method.\n- **Cash Outflows from Purchases**: Sum of all \"Purchase\" transactions with \"Paid\" status and \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" method.\n- **Cash Outflows from Expenses**: Sum of all \"Expense\" transactions with \"Paid\" status and \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" method.\n\nAfter performing the calculations:\n\n- Total Cash Inflows from Sales: [Sum of relevant sales]\n- Total Cash Outflows from Purchases: [Sum of relevant purchases]\n- Total Cash Outflows from Expenses: [Sum of relevant expenses]\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: [Inflows - Outflows]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities': '-7259994.10'}}\n```",
