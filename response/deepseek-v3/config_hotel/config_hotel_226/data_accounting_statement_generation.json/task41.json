                        "content": "To calculate the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" for the cash flow statement, we need to identify all purchase transactions where the payment method is \"Account Payable\" and the payment status is \"Unpaid\". These represent the amounts that have been recorded as accounts payable but have not yet been paid, thus affecting the accounts payable balance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Transactions**:\n   - Filter all purchase transactions where `payment_method` is \"Account Payable\" and `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\".\n   - These transactions represent the increase in accounts payable because the company has incurred liabilities but has not yet paid them.\n\n2. **List of Unpaid Purchases (Accounts Payable)**:\n   From the given data, the following purchases are unpaid and recorded as accounts payable:\n   - `Purchase20231231002`: 696,960.00\n   - `Purchase20231231003`: 394,560.00\n   - `Purchase20231231004`: 286,000.00\n   - `Purchase20231231008`: 544,000.00\n   - `Purchase20231231009`: 43,400.00\n   - `Purchase20231231011`: 163,500.00\n   - `Purchase20231231012`: 235,500.00\n   - `Purchase20231231013`: 466,560.00\n   - `Purchase20231231015`: 800,000.00\n   - `Purchase20231231016`: 685,000.00\n   - `Purchase20231231017`: 78,400.00\n   - `Purchase20231231018`: 64,750.00\n   - `Purchase20231231019`: 1,075,000.00\n   - `Purchase20231231020`: 236,720.00\n   - `Purchase20231231021`: 1,115,000.00\n   - `Purchase20231231022`: 88,880.00\n   - `Purchase20231231025`: 570,240.00\n\n3. **Sum the Unpaid Purchases**:\n   Add up all the unpaid purchase amounts to get the total increase in accounts payable:\n   \\[\n   696,960.00 + 394,560.00 + 286,000.00 + 544,000.00 + 43,400.00 + 163,500.00 + 235,500.00 + 466,560.00 + 800,000.00 + 685,000.00 + 78,400.00 + 64,750.00 + 1,075,000.00 + 236,720.00 + 1,115,000.00 + 88,880.00 + 570,240.00 = 7,119,470.00\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   The total increase in accounts payable is the sum of all unpaid purchases, which is **7,119,470.00**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '7119470.00'}}\n```",
