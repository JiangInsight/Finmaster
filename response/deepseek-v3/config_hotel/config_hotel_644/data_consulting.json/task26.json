                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three key financial ratios: Return on Equity (ROE), Debt to Asset Ratio, and Gross Profit Margin. I'll go through each one, explaining how to compute them based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Return on Equity (ROE)\n\n**Definition:** ROE measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Shareholder's Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 99,532.29\n\nFrom the balance sheet (End_date: 2024-02-01):\n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,099,532.29\n\nCalculating ROE:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{99,532.29}{16,099,532.29} \\times 100 \\approx 0.618 \\times 100 \\approx 0.62\\% \\]\n\nWait a minute, the example had a negative ROE, but here it's positive, which makes sense since the net profit is positive.\n\n### 2. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio indicates the proportion of a company's assets that are financed through debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet (End_date: 2024-02-01):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70\n- Total Assets = 21,737,442.99\n\nCalculating Debt to Asset Ratio:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{5,637,910.70}{21,737,442.99} \\approx 0.259 \\]\n\nSo, approximately 0.26.\n\n### 3. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 291,843.79\n- Total Revenue = 836,813.79\n\nCalculating Gross Profit Margin:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{291,843.79}{836,813.79} \\times 100 \\approx 34.87\\% \\]\n\nWait, let me double-check the numbers:\n291,843.79 / 836,813.79 ≈ 0.3487 → 34.87%\n\nBut in the example, the gross profit was 1,021,018.59 and revenue was 5,431,018.59, giving 18.80%. Here, our gross profit is a larger percentage of revenue, which seems plausible given the numbers.\n\n### Verifying Calculations\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. **ROE:**\n   - Net Profit: 99,532.29\n   - Equity: 16,099,532.29\n   - 99,532.29 / 16,099,532.29 ≈ 0.00618 → 0.62%\n\n2. **Debt to Asset:**\n   - Liabilities: 5,637,910.70\n   - Assets: 21,737,442.99\n   - 5,637,910.70 / 21,737,442.99 ≈ 0.259\n\n3. **Gross Profit Margin:**\n   - Gross Profit: 291,843.79\n   - Revenue: 836,813.79\n   - 291,843.79 / 836,813.79 ≈ 0.3487 → 34.87%\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.62%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.26', 'Gross Profit Margin': '34.87%'} }\n```",
