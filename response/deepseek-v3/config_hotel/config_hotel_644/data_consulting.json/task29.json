                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the four requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities listed) = 5,637,910.70\n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,099,532.29\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 5,637,910.70 / 16,099,532.29 ≈ 0.35\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:** Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 99,532.29\n- Total Revenue = 836,813.79\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (99,532.29 / 836,813.79) * 100 ≈ 11.89%\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:** ROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets = 21,737,442.99\n- Net Profit = 99,532.29\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (99,532.29 / 21,737,442.99) * 100 ≈ 0.46%\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:** Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since we don't have separate data for cash and credit sales), Net Credit Sales = Total Revenue = 836,813.79\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable:\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- End_amount for Accounts Receivable = 335,639.38\n- Initial_amount for Accounts Receivable = 0.00 (assuming it started at 0)\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable = (0 + 335,639.38) / 2 = 167,819.69\n\nCalculation:\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 836,813.79 / 167,819.69 ≈ 4.99\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.35', 'Net Profit Margin': '11.89%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '0.46%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '4.99'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check each calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - Liabilities: 5,637,910.70\n   - Equity: 16,099,532.29\n   - 5,637,910.70 / 16,099,532.29 ≈ 0.35 ✔\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - Net Profit: 99,532.29\n   - Revenue: 836,813.79\n   - (99,532.29 / 836,813.79) * 100 ≈ 11.89% ✔\n\n3. **ROA:**\n   - Net Profit: 99,532.29\n   - Total Assets: 21,737,442.99\n   - (99,532.29 / 21,737,442.99) * 100 ≈ 0.46% ✔\n\n4. **Accounts Receivable Turnover:**\n   - Sales: 836,813.79\n   - Avg AR: (0 + 335,639.38) / 2 = 167,819.69\n   - 836,813.79 / 167,819.69 ≈ 4.99 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The calculations seem correct based on the provided data.",
