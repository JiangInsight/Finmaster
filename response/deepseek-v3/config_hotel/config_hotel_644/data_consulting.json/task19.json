                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Current Ratio and the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: This measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations with its current assets. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: This shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n\n- **Total Current Assets (End_date: 2024-02-01)**: 10,453,882.43\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_date: 2024-02-01)**: 5,637,910.70\n- **Inventory (Initial_amount)**: 0.00 (on 2023-12-31)\n- **Inventory (End_amount)**: 7,446,940.00 (on 2024-02-01)\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 544,970.00\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{10,453,882.43}{5,637,910.70}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10,453,882.43}{5,637,910.70} \\approx 1.853\n\\]\n\nSo, the Current Ratio is approximately **1.85**.\n\n### Calculating the Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\nFirst, find the Average Inventory:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2} = \\frac{0.00 + 7,446,940.00}{2} = \\frac{7,446,940.00}{2} = 3,723,470.00\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} = \\frac{544,970.00}{3,723,470.00}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{544,970.00}{3,723,470.00} \\approx 0.146\n\\]\n\nHmm, this seems quite low. Typically, inventory turnover is higher, but given the numbers, this is the calculation. \n\nWait a minute—is the COGS really 544,970.00 for the period, and the average inventory is 3,723,470.00? That would imply that only a small portion of the inventory was sold during the period, which might make sense if the period is short (like a month or so), and the inventory is large compared to sales.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial inventory is not zero. But the balance sheet shows initial inventory as 0.00, which might imply that all inventory was purchased during the period, making the average inventory calculation correct as is.\n\nGiven that, the Inventory Turnover Ratio is approximately **0.15**.\n\nBut let me double-check the COGS and inventory figures to ensure I didn't misread anything.\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- COGS: 544,970.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Inventory: 0.00\n- Ending Inventory: 7,446,940.00\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct. Maybe the company purchased a lot of inventory but didn't sell much during this period, leading to a low turnover ratio.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating:\n\n- **Current Ratio**: 1.85\n- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: 0.15\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the Inventory Turnover Ratio was calculated as 1.73, which is much higher than our calculation. Maybe the initial inventory isn't zero in reality, or perhaps the COGS is annualized. But based on the given data, with initial inventory at zero, the calculation stands as is.\n\nGiven that, here's the final JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '1.85', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.15'}}\n```\n\nBut let me reconsider the Inventory Turnover Ratio calculation. Maybe the initial inventory isn't zero—perhaps the \"Initial_amount\" is at the start of the fiscal year, and the \"End_amount\" is at the end of the period, but the COGS is for that period. \n\nAlternatively, if the initial inventory is zero, and all inventory was purchased during the period, then the average inventory is half of the ending inventory, which seems correct. \n\nGiven that, unless there's a misinterpretation, the ratio is indeed low. Maybe the period is short, like a month, making the turnover low.\n\nGiven no additional information, sticking with the calculation:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '1.85', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.15'}}\n```\n\nHowever, looking at the example again, the initial inventory was also zero, and the COGS was 4,410,000 with ending inventory of 5,090,000, leading to an average inventory of (0 + 5,090,000)/2 = 2,545,000, and turnover of 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73, which matches the example. \n\nSimilarly here, COGS is 544,970, ending inventory is 7,446,940, initial is 0, so average is 3,723,470, and turnover is 544,970 / 3,723,470 ≈ 0.146, so ~0.15. \n\nSo the calculation seems correct based on the given data, even if the number seems low. Maybe the period is very short, like a month, and the inventory was built up significantly during that time with relatively low sales.\n\nThus, final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '1.85', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.15'}}\n```\n\nBut wait—the example had initial inventory as zero and end inventory as 5,090,000, COGS 4,410,000, giving turnover 1.73. Here, initial zero, end 7,446,940, COGS 544,970, so turnover is lower because COGS is much smaller relative to inventory. \n\nPerhaps the period is shorter (e.g., one month in the problem vs. one month in the example, but different scales). \n\nGiven that, the calculation seems correct based on the numbers provided.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '1.85', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.15'}}\n```",
