                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two things: the Free Cash Flow (FCF) and the Current Assets Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\n**1. Free Cash Flow (FCF):**\nFree Cash Flow is a measure of how much cash a company generates after accounting for capital expenditures like fixed assets. It's an important metric because it shows how much cash is available for expansion, dividends, or debt repayment.\n\nThe formula for FCF is:\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} - \\text{Capital Expenditures} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement, \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" is given directly, and \"Capital Expenditures\" can be inferred from the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" under investing activities.\n\n**2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio:**\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales. The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}} \\]\nWhere:\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Current Assets} + \\text{Ending Current Assets}}{2} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet, we have the initial and end amounts for Total Current Assets, and from the income statement, we have Total Revenue.\n\n### Calculating Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -1,919,526.63\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (Capital Expenditures): 3,415,664.34\n\nHowever, looking at the example provided, the FCF seems to be the \"Net Increase\" in \"Cash and Cash Equivalents,\" which is -5,335,190.97. This might be a simpler approach where FCF is the net change in cash and cash equivalents after all activities.\n\nBut traditionally, FCF is calculated as Operating Cash Flow minus Capital Expenditures. Let's do both to see which matches the example.\n\n**Traditional FCF:**\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = \\text{Operating Cash Flow} - \\text{Capital Expenditures} \\]\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = -1,919,526.63 - 3,415,664.34 = -5,335,190.97 \\]\n\nThis matches the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents. So, FCF is -5,335,190.97.\n\n**Alternative Interpretation:**\nIn the example, FCF was the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents, which was -7,565,348.53, matching the sum of operating and investing cash flows (-7,259,994.10 + -305,354.43 = -7,565,348.53).\n\nSo, it seems FCF is the sum of net cash flows from operating and investing activities, which is also the net increase in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nGiven that, for our problem:\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -1,919,526.63\nNet Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -3,415,664.34\nTotal FCF: -1,919,526.63 + (-3,415,664.34) = -5,335,190.97\n\nThis matches the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents of -5,335,190.97.\n\nSo, FCF = -5,335,190.97\n\n### Calculating Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\nFrom the income statement:\nTotal Revenue: 836,813.79\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\nInitial Total Current Assets: 8,000,000.00\nEnd Total Current Assets: 10,453,882.43\n\nAverage Current Assets:\n\\[ \\frac{8,000,000.00 + 10,453,882.43}{2} = \\frac{18,453,882.43}{2} = 9,226,941.215 \\]\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio:\n\\[ \\frac{836,813.79}{9,226,941.215} \\approx 0.0907 \\]\n\nWait a minute, the example had a ratio of 0.68 with revenue of 5,431,018.59 and average current assets of (8,000,000 + 7,956,806.47)/2 ≈ 7,978,403.235, so 5,431,018.59 / 7,978,403.235 ≈ 0.68, which checks out.\n\nIn our case, the ratio is much lower because revenue is relatively small compared to the average current assets.\n\nSo, Current Assets Turnover Ratio ≈ 0.0907\n\nBut let's check the numbers again to ensure no mistake.\n\nRevenue: 836,813.79\nInitial Current Assets: 8,000,000\nEnd Current Assets: 10,453,882.43\nAverage: (8,000,000 + 10,453,882.43)/2 = 9,226,941.215\nRatio: 836,813.79 / 9,226,941.215 ≈ 0.0907\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-5335190.97', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.09'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLooking back at the example:\n- FCF was the net increase in cash and cash equivalents, which was the sum of operating and investing cash flows.\n- Current Assets Turnover was revenue divided by average current assets.\n\nOur calculations follow the same method, yielding:\n- FCF: -5,335,190.97 (matches net increase in cash)\n- Current Assets Turnover: 0.09 (836,813.79 / 9,226,941.215)\n\nThus, the solution is correct.",
