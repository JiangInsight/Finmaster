                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement problem step by step. We need to calculate two key financial ratios: the **Gross Profit Margin** and the **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**: This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It indicates the company's short-term liquidity.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the provided financial statements, let's identify the numbers we need:\n\n**Income Statement:**\n- **Total Revenue**: 836,813.79\n- **Gross Profit**: 291,843.79\n\n**Cash Flow Statement:**\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -1,919,526.63 (This is a negative number, indicating cash outflow)\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 5,637,910.70\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{291,843.79}{836,813.79} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{291,843.79}{836,813.79} \\approx 0.3488\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.3488 \\times 100 \\approx 34.88\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **34.88%**.\n\n### Calculating Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-1,919,526.63}{5,637,910.70}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-1,919,526.63}{5,637,910.70} \\approx -0.3405\n\\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately **-0.34**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit: 291,843.79\n   - Total Revenue: 836,813.79\n   - 291,843.79 / 836,813.79 ≈ 0.3488 → 34.88%\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**:\n   - Net Operating Cash Flow: -1,919,526.63\n   - Current Liabilities: 5,637,910.70\n   - -1,919,526.63 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ -0.34\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '34.88%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.34'} }\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin (34.88%)**: This is a healthy margin, indicating that the company retains a good portion of revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold.\n  \n- **Operating Cash Flow Ratio (-0.34)**: A negative ratio suggests that the company's operating activities are not generating enough cash to cover its current liabilities, which could be a liquidity concern. This might be due to significant increases in inventory or accounts receivable, as seen in the cash flow statement where inventory increased by 7,446,940.00, and accounts receivable increased by 335,639.38, both of which consume cash.\n\nUnderstanding these ratios helps in assessing the company's profitability and liquidity positions. While the company is profitable in terms of gross margin, its cash flow from operations is negative, which warrants further investigation into its working capital management.",
