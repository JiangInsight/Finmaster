                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each of the three ratios we need to calculate: Debt to Equity Ratio, Net Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio. \n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's financing that comes from debt compared to its equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70\n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,099,532.29\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{5,637,910.70}{16,099,532.29} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n5,637,910.70 ÷ 16,099,532.29 ≈ 0.3502\n\nSo, the Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.35.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net profit is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\n**From the Income Statement:**\n- Net Profit = 99,532.29\n- Total Revenue = 836,813.79\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{99,532.29}{836,813.79} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFirst, divide Net Profit by Total Revenue:\n\n99,532.29 ÷ 836,813.79 ≈ 0.1189\n\nThen multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n0.1189 × 100 ≈ 11.89%\n\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is approximately 11.89%.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,919,526.63\n- From the Balance Sheet, Total Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{-1,919,526.63}{5,637,910.70} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n-1,919,526.63 ÷ 5,637,910.70 ≈ -0.3405\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio is approximately -0.34.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, let's present these ratios in the required JSON format, rounding to two decimal places where appropriate:\n\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.35\n- Net Profit Margin: 11.89%\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: -0.34\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.35', 'Net Profit Margin': '11.89%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.34'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - 5,637,910.70 / 16,099,532.29 ≈ 0.35 ✔\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - 99,532.29 / 836,813.79 ≈ 0.1189 → 11.89% ✔\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio:**\n   - -1,919,526.63 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ -0.34 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! \n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Debt to Equity Ratio (0.35):** This means the company has $0.35 in debt for every $1 of equity. This is a relatively low ratio, indicating that the company is not heavily leveraged and relies more on equity financing.\n  \n- **Net Profit Margin (11.89%):** This is a positive margin, meaning the company is profitable, earning about 11.89 cents in profit for every dollar of revenue. This is a healthy sign, though the absolute profit amount isn't very high.\n  \n- **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio (-0.34):** This negative ratio is a concern. It indicates that the company's operating activities are not generating enough cash to cover its current liabilities. The negative cash flow from operations could be due to significant increases in inventory or receivables, as seen in the cash flow statement (e.g., inventory increased by 7,446,940.00, which is a cash outflow).\n\nThis suggests that while the company is profitable on paper (income statement), it's experiencing cash flow challenges in managing its working capital. This could be a liquidity concern if not managed properly.\n\n### Final Answer (Reiterated)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.35', 'Net Profit Margin': '11.89%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.34'} }\n```",
