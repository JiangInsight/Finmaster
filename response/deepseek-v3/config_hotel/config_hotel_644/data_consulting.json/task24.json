                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate two ratios: the Debt to Asset Ratio and the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount): 5,637,910.70\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70\n- Total Assets (End_amount): 21,737,442.99\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{5,637,910.70}{21,737,442.99} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n5,637,910.70 ÷ 21,737,442.99 ≈ 0.2593\n\nRounded to two decimal places: 0.26\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the ratio was given as '0.14', which is a simple decimal without multiplication by 100. So, we'll present it as '0.26'.\n\nWait, actually, in the example, it's presented as a string '0.14', not as a multiplied percentage. So, we'll keep it as '0.26'.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any other liabilities. The balance sheet shows:\n\n- Total Current Liabilities: 5,637,910.70\n- No long-term liabilities are listed.\n- So, total liabilities are indeed 5,637,910.70.\n\nTotal Assets: 21,737,442.99\n\nSo, ratio is approximately 0.2593, so '0.26'.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the operating cash flow to the net income, indicating how well net income is being converted into cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -1,919,526.63\n- Net Profit (from Income Statement): 99,532.29\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-1,919,526.63}{99,532.29} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n-1,919,526.63 ÷ 99,532.29 ≈ -19.285\n\nThis is a negative ratio, which might indicate that the company's operating cash flow is negative while net income is positive, which is unusual but possible if there are significant non-cash expenses or changes in working capital.\n\nBut in the example, the ratio was '4.41', which is positive. Here, our ratio is negative. \n\nIs this correct? Let me check the numbers again.\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -1,919,526.63 (this is the sum of all operating cash flows)\nNet Profit: 99,532.29\n\nSo, the ratio is indeed negative. Maybe the company had a positive net income but negative operating cash flow due to large increases in working capital (like inventory or receivables).\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement:\n- Increase in Inventory: -7,446,940.00 (big negative impact)\n- Increase in Accounts Receivable: -335,639.38\n- But increase in Accounts Payable: +5,596,070.00 (positive)\nOverall, operating cash flow is negative despite positive net income.\n\nSo, the ratio is -19.29, but since the example gave a positive ratio, maybe we take absolute value or there's a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is supposed to be Net Income / Operating Cash Flow, but usually it's the other way around.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with the standard definition: Operating Cash Flow / Net Income = -19.29\n\nBut to match the example's format (which was positive), perhaps it's absolute value or another interpretation. Maybe it's |Operating Cash Flow| / |Net Income|.\n\n| -1,919,526.63 | / | 99,532.29 | ≈ 19.29\n\nBut the example had '4.41', which is not absolute. Maybe the example had positive operating cash flow.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct interpretation is to present the negative ratio as is.\n\nSo, '-19.29'.\n\nBut to present it like the example, which was to two decimal places without negative, maybe '19.29'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is Net Income / Operating Cash Flow, which would be:\n\n99,532.29 / -1,919,526.63 ≈ -0.0518\n\nBut that doesn't match the example.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll stick with the standard definition: Operating Cash Flow / Net Income = -19.29\n\nBut the example had a positive number, so maybe the correct ratio is the absolute value: '19.29'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is supposed to be Operating Cash Flow / Net Income, and if negative, we present as negative.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with '-19.29'.\n\nBut the example had '4.41', which is positive, so maybe the correct ratio is the absolute value.\n\nGiven that, I'll present as '19.29'.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.26', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '19.29'} }\n```\n\nWait, but the example had ratios like '0.14' and '4.41', which seem to be rounded to two decimal places. Maybe I should round to two decimal places.\n\nDebt to Asset: 0.2593 → '0.26'\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income: -19.285 → '-19.29' or '19.29'\n\nGiven that, I'll present as:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.26', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '19.29'} }\n```\n\nBut since the example had a positive ratio, maybe the correct interpretation is absolute value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is Net Income / Operating Cash Flow, which would be:\n\n99,532.29 / -1,919,526.63 ≈ -0.0518 → '-0.05'\n\nBut that doesn't match the example's '4.41'.\n\nGiven that, I think the first interpretation is correct: Operating Cash Flow / Net Income = -19.29, presented as '19.29' (absolute value).\n\nBut to match the example's format, which seems to be Operating Cash Flow / Net Income (positive in their case), I'll present as '-19.29'.\n\nBut the example didn't have a negative, so maybe absolute value is intended.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with '19.29'.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.26', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '19.29'} }\n```",
