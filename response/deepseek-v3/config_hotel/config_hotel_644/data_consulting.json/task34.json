                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand where each number comes from.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,919,526.63\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70\n\n**Calculation:**  \n-1,919,526.63 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ -0.34\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70 (since there are no non-current liabilities listed)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,099,532.29\n\n**Calculation:**  \n5,637,910.70 / 16,099,532.29 ≈ 0.35\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 836,813.79\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Assets = 16,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets = 21,737,442.99\n- Average Total Assets = (16,000,000 + 21,737,442.99) / 2 = 18,868,721.50\n\n**Calculation:**  \n836,813.79 / 18,868,721.50 ≈ 0.044\n\n*Wait a minute, this seems very low compared to the example. Maybe I should check if \"Main Business Revenue\" is the same as \"Net Sales\"? In the example, \"Main Business Revenue\" was used as \"Total Revenue\", so I think it's correct.*\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 10,453,882.43\n- Inventory = 7,446,940.00\n- Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70\n\n**Calculation:**  \n(10,453,882.43 - 7,446,940.00) / 5,637,910.70 ≈ 3,006,942.43 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ 0.53\n\n*Hmm, the example had a quick ratio of 1.54, but here it's lower. Maybe I missed something. Let me check the current assets components: Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, Accounts Receivable, Inventory. So Quick Assets are Cash + Bank + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable.*\n\nLet me recalculate Quick Assets:\n- Cash on Hand = 2,105,753.37\n- Bank Deposits = 559,055.66\n- Interest Receivable = 6,494.02\n- Accounts Receivable = 335,639.38\n- Total Quick Assets = 2,105,753.37 + 559,055.66 + 6,494.02 + 335,639.38 = 3,006,942.43\n\nYes, same as before. So Quick Ratio is indeed ~0.53.\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nThis seems identical to the first ratio. Maybe it's the same? In the example, both were -3.90.\n\nSo:\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -1,919,526.63 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ -0.34\n\nBut in the example, both ratios had the same value. Maybe there's a different definition? Alternatively, perhaps Operating Cash Flow is different from Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities. \n\nLooking at the cash flow statement, \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" is the sum below, which includes Net Profit, Depreciation, changes in working capital, etc. Maybe Operating Cash Flow is just Net Profit + Depreciation?\n\nLet me try that:\nOperating Cash Flow = Net Profit + Depreciation = 99,532.29 + 132,103.78 = 231,636.07\n\nThen Operating Cash Flow Ratio = 231,636.07 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ 0.041\n\nBut this doesn't match the example where both were the same. Maybe the initial interpretation was correct, and both ratios are the same, calculated as Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with -0.34 for both.\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Profit / Average Shareholder's Equity\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 99,532.29\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Equity = 16,000,000.00\n- End Equity = 16,099,532.29\n- Average Equity = (16,000,000 + 16,099,532.29) / 2 = 16,049,766.15\n\n**Calculation:**  \n99,532.29 / 16,049,766.15 ≈ 0.0062 or 0.62%\n\n*The example had -13.51%, so this seems reasonable for a positive but small profit.*\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since we don't have info on cash sales), Net Credit Sales = Total Revenue = 836,813.79\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00\n- End Accounts Receivable = 335,639.38\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 335,639.38) / 2 = 167,819.69\n\n**Calculation:**  \n836,813.79 / 167,819.69 ≈ 4.99\n\n*The example had 4.47, so this seems in the same ballpark.*\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter recalculating and verifying, here are the ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.34', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.35', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.044', 'Quick Ratio': '0.53', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.34', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.62%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '4.99'} }\n```\n\n*Note: Some ratios like Operating Cash Flow Ratio might have alternative definitions, but based on the given data and consistency with the example, this seems appropriate.*",
