                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand where each number comes from.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all revenue is credit sales since no cash sales are mentioned): \\$836,813.79\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable (from initial balance sheet): \\$0.00\n- Ending Accounts Receivable: \\$335,639.38\n\n**Average Accounts Receivable:**\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{Beginning AR} + \\text{Ending AR}}{2} = \\frac{0 + 335,639.38}{2} = \\$167,819.69 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\frac{836,813.79}{167,819.69} \\approx 4.99 \\]\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Operating Cash Flow (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities): -\\$1,919,526.63\n- Current Liabilities: \\$5,637,910.70\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\frac{-1,919,526.63}{5,637,910.70} \\approx -0.34 \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis seems identical to the Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the example provided. So, same calculation:\n\n\\[ -0.34 \\]\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Sales}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Sales: \\$836,813.79\n- Beginning Total Assets: \\$16,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets: \\$21,737,442.99\n\n**Average Total Assets:**\n\\[ \\frac{16,000,000 + 21,737,442.99}{2} = \\frac{37,737,442.99}{2} = \\$18,868,721.50 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\frac{836,813.79}{18,868,721.50} \\approx 0.044 \\]\n\nHmm, this seems quite low compared to the example (which was 0.41). Maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check:\n\nWait, in the example, the Total Revenue was \\$5,431,018.59 and Average Total Assets were (\\$13,000,000 + \\$13,216,409.49)/2 ≈ \\$13,108,204.75, giving a ratio of ~0.41, which matches their solution. \n\nIn our case, the ratio is indeed much lower because the revenue is much smaller relative to the assets. So, 0.044 seems correct.\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Total Liabilities (from end balance sheet): \n  - Total Current Liabilities: \\$5,637,910.70\n  - No long-term liabilities mentioned, so total liabilities = \\$5,637,910.70\n- Total Shareholders' Equity: \\$16,099,532.29\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\frac{5,637,910.70}{16,099,532.29} \\approx 0.35 \\]\n\nWait, in the example, their solution was 0.16, and their total liabilities were \\$1,861,550.92 with equity \\$11,354,858.57, giving ~0.16. \n\nIn our case, it's ~0.35, which seems correct based on the numbers.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '4.99', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-0.34', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.34', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.04', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.35'}}\n```\n\n**Wait a minute!** \n\nLooking back at the example, their Total Asset Turnover was 0.41 with revenue ~5.4M and average assets ~13.1M. Here, our revenue is ~0.84M and average assets ~18.9M, so 0.84/18.9 ≈ 0.044, which I rounded to 0.04. But their ratio was to two decimal places, so maybe I should keep it as 0.04 or show more precision like 0.044? \n\nSimilarly, the debt to equity was 0.35, but their example was to two decimal places. Maybe I should round to two decimals for consistency.\n\nLet me adjust:\n\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover: 4.99 (already two decimals)\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -0.34\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities: -0.34\n- Total Asset Turnover: 0.04 (or 0.044? The example had 0.41, which is two decimals, so maybe 0.04)\n- Debt to Equity: 0.35\n\nGiven that, I'll present it as:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '4.99', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-0.34', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.34', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.04', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.35'}}\n```\n\nBut looking at the example's Total Asset Turnover, it was 0.41 (not 0.414), so they might have rounded down. So 0.044 could be 0.04.\n\nSimilarly, debt to equity was 0.16 in the example, which is two decimals, so 0.35 seems correct here.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '4.99', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-0.34', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.34', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.04', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.35'}}\n```",
