                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. We'll calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio, Gross Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (which is the total liabilities here since there are no non-current liabilities listed):** 5,637,910.70\n- **Total Assets:** 21,737,442.99\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{5,637,910.70}{21,737,442.99} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ \\frac{5,637,910.70}{21,737,442.99} \\approx 0.259 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.26 or 26% when expressed as a percentage. However, since the example provided the ratio as a decimal without percentage, we'll keep it as 0.26.\n\nWait, looking back at the example, the solution was given as '0.14', which is a decimal. So, we'll present it similarly here.\n\nBut let's double-check if we're considering all liabilities correctly. The balance sheet shows:\n- Total Current Liabilities: 5,637,910.70\n- No long-term liabilities are listed, so total liabilities = 5,637,910.70\n- Total Assets: 21,737,442.99\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct. Maybe the example had different numbers leading to 0.14. Here, it's 0.26.\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 291,843.79\n- **Total Revenue:** 836,813.79\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{291,843.79}{836,813.79} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\\[ \\frac{291,843.79}{836,813.79} \\approx 0.3488 \\]\n\nMultiply by 100:\n\\[ 0.3488 \\times 100 \\approx 34.88\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately 34.88%.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -1,919,526.63\n- From the balance sheet:\n  - **Total Current Liabilities:** 5,637,910.70\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-1,919,526.63}{5,637,910.70} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ \\frac{-1,919,526.63}{5,637,910.70} \\approx -0.34 \\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately -0.34.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.26', 'Gross Profit Margin': '34.88%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.34'} }\n```\n\nHowever, let's cross-validate the Debt to Asset Ratio calculation to ensure no mistakes.\n\n**Rechecking Debt to Asset Ratio:**\nTotal Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 5,596,070.00 + 41,840.70 = 5,637,910.70\nTotal Assets = 21,737,442.99\nRatio = 5,637,910.70 / 21,737,442.99 ≈ 0.259 ≈ 0.26\n\nYes, it's correct.\n\nSimilarly, the other ratios seem correctly calculated based on the provided data.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.26', 'Gross Profit Margin': '34.88%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.34'} }\n```",
