                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through them step by step, explaining how to calculate each one based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operating activities. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,919,526.63\nFrom the balance sheet (end date):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-1,919,526.63}{5,637,910.70} \\approx -0.34 \\]\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the ability of a company to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to determine Total Debt. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are:\n- Accounts Payable = 5,596,070.00\n- Taxes Payable = 41,840.70\nTotal Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70 (which seems to be the total debt since there are no long-term liabilities listed).\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-1,919,526.63}{5,637,910.70} \\approx -0.34 \\]\n\n*Note: This seems the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio because total debt here equals current liabilities. Maybe there's a different interpretation, but based on the given data, this is the calculation.*\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 544,970.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00\n- Ending Inventory = 7,446,940.00\nAverage Inventory = (Initial + Ending) / 2 = (0 + 7,446,940) / 2 = 3,723,470.00\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{544,970.00}{3,723,470.00} \\approx 0.146 \\]\n\n*Wait a minute, this seems very low. Maybe the initial inventory is not zero? Or perhaps the inventory was zero at the start and all purchases are in the period, making the average inventory just the ending inventory? Alternatively, maybe the Cost of Goods Sold is for a different period. Given the data, this is the calculation, but it seems unusually low.*\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the initial inventory is zero and all inventory was purchased during the period, perhaps the average inventory is just the ending inventory (since it's all new):\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{544,970.00}{7,446,940.00} \\approx 0.073 \\]\n\nThis seems even lower. Maybe there's a mistake in interpreting the inventory data. Given the example, it seems initial inventory was zero, and ending inventory is as given, so the calculation stands, but the ratio is very low, indicating slow inventory turnover.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholder equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70\n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,099,532.29\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{5,637,910.70}{16,099,532.29} \\approx 0.35 \\]\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to meet short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets} - \\text{Inventory}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 10,453,882.43\n- Inventory = 7,446,940.00\n- Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{10,453,882.43 - 7,446,940.00}{5,637,910.70} = \\frac{3,006,942.43}{5,637,910.70} \\approx 0.53 \\]\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to pay short-term obligations with current assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = 10,453,882.43\n- Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{10,453,882.43}{5,637,910.70} \\approx 1.85 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the summary:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.34', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.34', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.15', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.35', 'Quick Ratio': '0.53', 'Current Ratio': '1.85'} }\n```\n\n*Note: The Inventory Turnover Ratio is unusually low based on the given data, which might indicate either a data interpretation issue or a very slow inventory turnover in the given period.*",
