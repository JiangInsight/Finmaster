                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Asset Ratio\nFirst, what is the Debt to Asset Ratio? From what I understand, it's a financial metric that shows the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nBut what counts as \"Total Debt\"? Typically, it refers to the company's total liabilities. So, in the balance sheet, the \"Total Liabilities\" would be the numerator, and \"Total Assets\" would be the denominator.\n\n### Identifying the Relevant Figures from the Balance Sheet\nLooking at the provided balance sheet as of the end date (2024-02-01), here are the relevant lines:\n\n1. **Total Assets**: This is given directly as \"Total Assets\" with an \"End_amount\" of 21,737,442.99.\n2. **Total Liabilities**: The balance sheet shows \"Total Current Liabilities\" with an \"End_amount\" of 5,637,910.70. There doesn't seem to be any \"Non-current Liabilities\" listed, so the total liabilities would just be the current liabilities in this case.\n\nWait a minuteâ€”is that correct? Let me check if there are any other liabilities listed. \n\nLooking at the accounts:\n- Accounts Payable: 5,596,070.00\n- Taxes Payable: 41,840.70\n- Total Current Liabilities: 5,637,910.70 (which is the sum of Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable)\n  \nThere's no mention of long-term debt or other non-current liabilities. So, total liabilities = total current liabilities = 5,637,910.70.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{5,637,910.70}{21,737,442.99} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5,637,910.70}{21,737,442.99} \\approx 0.259 \\]\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 0.26 when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided, the ratio was given as '0.14', which is a simpler decimal. Maybe I should round to two decimal places without additional precision unless specified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is typically expressed as a decimal rounded to two places, so 0.26 seems correct.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nLooking back at the example:\n\n- Total Assets: 13,216,409.49\n- Total Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\n- Ratio given: 0.14\n\nCalculating the example:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,861,550.92}{13,216,409.49} \\approx 0.1409 \\] which rounds to 0.14, matching the given solution.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5,637,910.70}{21,737,442.99} \\approx 0.2593 \\] which rounds to 0.26.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter carefully calculating, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.26.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.26'} }\n```",
