                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: This ratio measures a company's ability to cover its debts with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   Here, \"Total Debt\" can be considered as the \"Total Current Liabilities\" from the balance sheet since that represents the company's short-term obligations.\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the provided financial statements, let's extract the necessary figures.\n\n**Income Statement:**\n- Total Revenue: \\$836,813.79\n- Gross Profit: \\$291,843.79\n\n**Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$1,919,526.63\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Liabilities: \\$5,637,910.70\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{291,843.79}{836,813.79} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[\n\\frac{291,843.79}{836,813.79} \\approx 0.3488\n\\]\n\\[\n0.3488 \\times 100 \\approx 34.88\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **34.88%**.\n\n### Calculating Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-1,919,526.63}{5,637,910.70}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\\[\n\\frac{-1,919,526.63}{5,637,910.70} \\approx -0.340\n\\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-0.34**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit / Total Revenue = 291,843.79 / 836,813.79 ≈ 0.3488 → 34.88%\n   - This seems correct.\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   - Operating Cash Flow is negative, which isn't ideal, but the calculation is straightforward.\n   - -1,919,526.63 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ -0.34\n   - This also seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating both ratios, here's the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '34.88%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.34'} }\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin**: A margin of 34.88% indicates that for every dollar of revenue, the company retains about 34.88 cents after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This is a healthy margin, suggesting good control over production costs relative to sales.\n  \n- **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: A negative ratio (-0.34) means that the company's operating activities are not generating enough cash to cover its current liabilities. This could be a sign of financial stress, especially if this trend continues over time. It might indicate that the company is investing heavily or facing operational challenges that are draining cash.\n\nUnderstanding these ratios helps in assessing the company's profitability and financial health. While the gross profit looks good, the negative cash flow relative to debt is a concern that would warrant further investigation.",
