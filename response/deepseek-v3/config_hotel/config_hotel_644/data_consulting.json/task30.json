                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio one by one using the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 10,453,882.43\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 5,637,910.70\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 10,453,882.43 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ 1.85\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 2,105,753.37\n- Bank Deposits = 559,055.66\n- Interest Receivable = 6,494.02\n- Accounts Receivable = 335,639.38\n- Total Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 2,105,753.37 + 559,055.66 + 6,494.02 + 335,639.38 ≈ 3,006,942.43\n\nQuick Ratio = 3,006,942.43 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ 0.53\n\n*Wait a minute*, usually \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" include cash on hand and bank deposits. Interest receivable and accounts receivable are also typically included in quick assets unless specified otherwise. But let me double-check the components.\n\nLooking at the example provided in the task, their quick ratio calculation included Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, and Accounts Receivable. So I think my calculation is correct.\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since there are no non-current liabilities listed) = 5,637,910.70\n- Total Assets = 21,737,442.99\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 5,637,910.70 / 21,737,442.99 ≈ 0.26\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 5,637,910.70\n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,099,532.29\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 5,637,910.70 / 16,099,532.29 ≈ 0.35\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,919,526.63\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 5,637,910.70\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -1,919,526.63 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ -0.34\n\n*Note:* A negative ratio indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative, which isn't favorable.\n\n### Verifying Calculations:\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. Current Ratio: 10,453,882.43 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ 1.85 ✔\n2. Quick Ratio: (2,105,753.37 + 559,055.66 + 6,494.02 + 335,639.38) / 5,637,910.70 ≈ 3,006,942.43 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ 0.53 ✔\n3. Debt to Asset: 5,637,910.70 / 21,737,442.99 ≈ 0.26 ✔\n4. Debt to Equity: 5,637,910.70 / 16,099,532.29 ≈ 0.35 ✔\n5. Cash Flow to Debt: -1,919,526.63 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ -0.34 ✔\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '1.85', 'Quick Ratio': '0.53', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.26', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.35', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.34'}}\n```",
