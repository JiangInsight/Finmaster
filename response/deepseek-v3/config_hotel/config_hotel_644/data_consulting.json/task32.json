                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested metrics based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nFree Cash Flow is typically calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = \\text{Operating Cash Flow} - \\text{Capital Expenditures} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -1,919,526.63\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities (which includes Purchase of Fixed Assets): -3,415,664.34\n  - This implies Capital Expenditures (CapEx) = 3,415,664.34 (since it's a purchase)\n\nBut looking at the \"Net Increase\" in Cash and Cash Equivalents: -5,335,190.97\nThis seems to be the total change in cash, which is the sum of Operating and Investing cash flows:\n- Operating: -1,919,526.63\n- Investing: -3,415,664.34\n- Total: -5,335,190.97\n\nIn the example provided, FCF was taken as the \"Net Increase\" in cash. So, following that:\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = -5,335,190.97 \\]\n\n### 2. Return on Assets (ROA)\nROA is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Total Assets} + \\text{Ending Total Assets}}{2} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Total Assets: 16,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets: 21,737,442.99\n- Average Total Assets = (16,000,000 + 21,737,442.99) / 2 = 18,868,721.495\n- Net Income (from income statement): 99,532.29\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\frac{99,532.29}{18,868,721.495} \\approx 0.005275 \\text{ or } 0.53\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Return on Equity (ROE)\nROE is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Average Shareholder's Equity}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Average Equity} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Equity} + \\text{Ending Equity}}{2} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Equity: 16,000,000.00\n- Ending Equity: 16,099,532.29\n- Average Equity = (16,000,000 + 16,099,532.29) / 2 = 16,049,766.145\n- Net Income: 99,532.29\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{99,532.29}{16,049,766.145} \\approx 0.006201 \\text{ or } 0.62\\% \\]\n\n### 4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\nThis is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Net Income}} \\]\n\nFrom cash flow statement:\n- Operating Cash Flow: -1,919,526.63\n- Net Income: 99,532.29\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-1,919,526.63}{99,532.29} \\approx -19.29 \\]\n\nThis seems unusually high in magnitude and negative, which might indicate that the company's operating cash flow is significantly negative compared to its net income.\n\n### 5. Net Profit Margin\nNet Profit Margin is:\n\\[ \\text{Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\]\n\nFrom income statement:\n- Net Income: 99,532.29\n- Total Revenue: 836,813.79\n\n\\[ \\text{Margin} = \\frac{99,532.29}{836,813.79} \\approx 0.119 \\text{ or } 11.90\\% \\]\n\n### 6. Gross Profit Margin\nGross Profit Margin is:\n\\[ \\text{Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\]\n\nFrom income statement:\n- Gross Profit: 291,843.79\n- Total Revenue: 836,813.79\n\n\\[ \\text{Margin} = \\frac{291,843.79}{836,813.79} \\approx 0.3488 \\text{ or } 34.88\\% \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-5335190.97', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '0.53%', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.62%', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-19.29', 'Net Profit Margin': '11.90%', 'Gross Profit Margin': '34.88%'}}\n```\n\n### Verification:\nLet me double-check a couple of things:\n\n1. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio**: \n   - Operating Cash Flow is negative, Net Income is positive, so the ratio should indeed be negative. The magnitude seems correct based on the numbers.\n\n2. **ROA and ROE**: \n   - Both are positive but small, which makes sense given the small net income relative to the asset and equity bases.\n\n3. **Margins**: \n   - Gross Profit Margin is higher than Net Profit Margin, which is expected since gross profit is before other expenses.\n\nEverything checks out!",
