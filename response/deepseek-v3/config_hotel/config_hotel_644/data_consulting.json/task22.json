                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Quick Ratio and the Net Profit Margin based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):**\n   - This measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n   - Formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n     \\]\n   - Quick Assets typically include: Cash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Accounts Receivable. Sometimes, Interest Receivable is also included if it's expected to be received shortly.\n   - In this case, Quick Assets would be:\n     - Cash on Hand\n     - Bank Deposits\n     - Interest Receivable\n     - Accounts Receivable\n   - Inventory is excluded because it's not as liquid.\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - This shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue.\n   - Formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n     \\]\n   - It's given as a percentage.\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts for 2024-02-01):\n\n- **Quick Assets:**\n  - Cash on Hand: 2,105,753.37\n  - Bank Deposits: 559,055.66\n  - Interest Receivable: 6,494.02\n  - Accounts Receivable: 335,639.38\n- **Current Liabilities:**\n  - Total Current Liabilities: 5,637,910.70\n- **From Income Statement:**\n  - Net Profit: 99,532.29\n  - Total Revenue: 836,813.79\n\n### Calculating Quick Ratio\n\nFirst, sum up the quick assets:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Assets} = \\text{Cash on Hand} + \\text{Bank Deposits} + \\text{Interest Receivable} + \\text{Accounts Receivable}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2,105,753.37 + 559,055.66 + 6,494.02 + 335,639.38\n\\]\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n1. 2,105,753.37 + 559,055.66 = 2,664,809.03\n2. 2,664,809.03 + 6,494.02 = 2,671,303.05\n3. 2,671,303.05 + 335,639.38 = 3,006,942.43\n\nSo, Quick Assets = 3,006,942.43\n\nNow, Quick Ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{3,006,942.43}{5,637,910.70}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n3,006,942.43 ÷ 5,637,910.70 ≈ 0.533\n\nSo, Quick Ratio ≈ 0.53\n\n### Calculating Net Profit Margin\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{99,532.29}{836,813.79} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nFirst, divide Net Profit by Total Revenue:\n\n99,532.29 ÷ 836,813.79 ≈ 0.1189\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get percentage:\n\n0.1189 × 100 ≈ 11.89%\n\n### Verifying Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the Quick Assets addition:\n\n- 2,105,753.37\n- + 559,055.66 = 2,664,809.03\n- + 6,494.02 = 2,671,303.05\n- + 335,639.38 = 3,006,942.43 ✔\n\nQuick Ratio: 3,006,942.43 / 5,637,910.70 ≈ 0.533 ✔\n\nNet Profit Margin: 99,532.29 / 836,813.79 ≈ 0.1189 → 11.89% ✔\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '0.53', 'Net Profit Margin': '11.89%'} }\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the Quick Ratio was calculated including more items (possibly all current assets except inventory), but traditionally, Quick Ratio excludes inventory. Given that, if we consider the traditional definition, our calculation is correct. But if the example includes more items, let's see:\n\nAlternative Quick Assets (if including all current assets except inventory is the definition here):\n\nTotal Current Assets: 10,453,882.43\nInventory: 7,446,940.00\nQuick Assets = Total Current Assets - Inventory = 10,453,882.43 - 7,446,940.00 = 3,006,942.43\n\nSame as before. So, Quick Ratio is indeed 0.53.\n\nBut in the example, Quick Ratio was higher, possibly because their current liabilities were lower relative to quick assets. Here, our calculation seems correct based on standard definitions.\n\nSimilarly, Net Profit Margin is correctly calculated as 11.89%.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '0.53', 'Net Profit Margin': '11.89%'} }\n```",
