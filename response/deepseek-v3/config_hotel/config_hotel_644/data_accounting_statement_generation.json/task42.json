This is because the cash flow statement reflects actual cash transactions, and only the taxes from paid sales would have been collected and thus affect the cash flow.\n\nLet's go through the transactions step by step:\n\n1. Identify all sales transactions where the payment/receipt status is \"Paid\".\n2. Extract the tax_amount from each of these transactions.\n3. Sum all these tax amounts to get the total tax payable.\n\nHere are the relevant sales transactions with \"Paid\" status and their tax amounts:\n\n- Sale20240104006: tax_amount = 1336.78\n- Sale20240104008: tax_amount = 31.84\n- Sale20240105011: tax_amount = 33.66\n- Sale20240105012: tax_amount = 40.43\n- Sale20240105013: tax_amount = 988.08\n- Sale20240106014: tax_amount = 379.58\n- Sale20240107016: tax_amount = 64.48\n- Sale20240107017: tax_amount = 321.1\n- Sale20240107018: tax_amount = 437.65\n- Sale20240108021: tax_amount = 119.63\n- Sale20240109025: tax_amount = 85.48\n- Sale20240110026: tax_amount = 1795.14\n- Sale20240110027: tax_amount = 671.64\n- Sale20240111031: tax_amount = 213.02\n- Sale20240111032: tax_amount = 762.36\n- Sale20240112034: tax_amount = 12.6\n- Sale20240112035: tax_amount = 141.09\n- Sale20240112036: tax_amount = 269.62\n- Sale20240113037: tax_amount = 26.53\n- Sale20240113039: tax_amount = 332.0\n- Sale20240113040: tax_amount = 142.78\n- Sale20240114041: tax_amount = 693.47\n- Sale20240114042: tax_amount = 292.0\n- Sale20240114043: tax_amount = 664.79\n- Sale20240115044: tax_amount = 80.13\n- Sale20240115046: tax_amount = 694.85\n- Sale20240116048: tax_amount = 117.78\n- Sale20240116050: tax_amount = 272.54\n- Sale20240117052: tax_amount = 103.15\n- Sale20240118056: tax_amount = 85.53\n- Sale20240120060: tax_amount = 535.24\n- Sale20240120061: tax_amount = 140.2\n- Sale20240121063: tax_amount = 62.0\n- Sale20240121065: tax_amount = 174.05\n- Sale20240122068: tax_amount = 125.03\n- Sale20240123071: tax_amount = 145.83\n- Sale20240123072: tax_amount = 424.62\n- Sale20240123073: tax_amount = 26.14\n- Sale20240123074: tax_amount = 752.98\n- Sale20240124075: tax_amount = 112.49\n- Sale20240124076: tax_amount = 1167.78\n- Sale20240124077: tax_amount = 1894.4\n- Sale20240124078: tax_amount = 82.39\n- Sale20240125080: tax_amount = 1692.07\n- Sale20240126083: tax_amount = 352.04\n- Sale20240126085: tax_amount = 1026.17\n- Sale20240126086: tax_amount = 947.3\n- Sale20240127089: tax_amount = 2023.67 (but this is Unpaid, so we exclude it)\n- Sale20240127090: tax_amount = 693.68 (but this is Unpaid, so we exclude it)\n- Sale20240128092: tax_amount = 665.22\n- Sale20240128093: tax_amount = 444.73\n- Sale20240128094: tax_amount = 398.83\n- Sale20240128095: tax_amount = 34.06\n- Sale20240129096: tax_amount = 219.5\n- Sale20240129098: tax_amount = 719.38\n- Sale20240129099: tax_amount = 838.59 (but this is Unpaid, so we exclude it)\n- Sale20240130101: tax_amount = 42.1\n- Sale20240130102: tax_amount = 198.76\n- Sale20240130103: tax_amount = 75.52 (but this is Unpaid, so we exclude it)\n- Sale20240131105: tax_amount = 497.98\n- Sale20240131106: tax_amount = 12.31 (but this is Unpaid, so we exclude it)\n- Sale20240131107: tax_amount = 124.25\n- Sale20240201108: tax_amount = 255.75 (but this is Unpaid, so we exclude it)\n- Sale20240201109: tax_amount = 196.65 (but this is Unpaid, so we exclude it)\n- Sale20240201110: tax_amount = 33.01 (but this is Unpaid, so we exclude it)\n\nNow, let's sum all the tax amounts from the paid sales:\n\n1336.78 + 31.84 + 33.66 + 40.43 + 988.08 + 379.58 + 64.48 + 321.1 + 437.65 + 119.63 + 85.48 + 1795.14 + 671.64 + 213.02 + 762.36 + 12.6 + 141.09 + 269.62 + 26.53 + 332.0 + 142.78 + 693.47 + 292.0 + 664.79 + 80.13 + 694.85 + 117.78 + 272.54 + 103.15 + 85.53 + 535.24 + 140.2 + 62.0 + 174.05 + 125.03 + 145.83 + 424.62 + 26.14 + 752.98 + 112.49 + 1167.78 + 1894.4 + 82.39 + 1692.07 + 352.04 + 1026.17 + 947.3 + 665.22 + 444.73 + 398.83 + 34.06 + 219.5 + 719.38 + 42.1 + 198.76 + 497.98 + 124.25 = 20,932.18\n\nTherefore, the \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" is 20,932.18.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '20932.18'} }\n```",
