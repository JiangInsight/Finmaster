Accounts receivable represents the money owed to the company by its customers for goods or services that have been delivered but not yet paid for. \n\n### Steps to Calculate Accounts Receivable:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Accounts Receivable**: \n   - The initial value of accounts receivable is typically zero unless there are any transactions marked as \"Unpaid\" before the start date (2023-12-31 in this case). \n   - From the given data, there are no transactions before 2023-12-31 with \"Unpaid\" status, so the initial value is 0.\n\n2. **Identify Transactions Contributing to Accounts Receivable**:\n   - Accounts receivable increases when a sale is made with the \"payment/receipt_status\" as \"Unpaid\" and the \"receive_method\" as \"Account Receviable\".\n   - We need to sum the \"after_tax_amount\" for all such transactions.\n\n3. **Calculate the End Value of Accounts Receivable**:\n   - Sum all the \"after_tax_amount\" values from the sales transactions where \"payment/receipt_status\" is \"Unpaid\" and \"receive_method\" is \"Account Receviable\".\n\n### Transactions Contributing to Accounts Receivable:\nFrom the given data, the following transactions contribute to accounts receivable (filtered by \"Unpaid\" and \"Account Receviable\"):\n\n1.
