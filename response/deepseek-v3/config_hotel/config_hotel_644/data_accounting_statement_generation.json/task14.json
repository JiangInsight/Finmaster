Current liabilities typically include amounts owed to suppliers (accounts payable) and other short-term obligations that are unpaid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Current Liabilities:**\n   - The initial current liabilities are the amounts recorded as unpaid at the beginning of the period (2023-12-31).\n   - From the data, the initial unpaid purchases are:\n     - `Purchase20231231001`: 809,280.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231002`: 19,650.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231005`: 44,850.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231006`: 605,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231012`: 100,800.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231015`: 1,470,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231016`: 700,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231017`: 218,240.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231018`: 399,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231020`: 558,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n   - Sum of initial current liabilities: \n     \\[\n     809,280.0 + 19,650.0 + 44,850.0 + 605,000.0 + 100,800.0 + 1,470,000.0 + 700,000.0 + 218,240.0 + 399,000.0 + 558,000.0 = 4,924,820.0\n     \\]\n\n2. **Identify Final Current Liabilities:**\n   - The final current liabilities are the amounts recorded as unpaid at the end of the period (2024-02-01).\n   - From the data, the unpaid purchases are:\n     - `Purchase20231231001`: 809,280.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231002`: 19,650.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231005`: 44,850.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231006`: 605,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231012`: 100,800.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231015`: 1,470,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231016`: 700,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231017`: 218,240.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231018`: 399,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231020`: 558,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n   - Sum of final current liabilities: \n     \\[\n     809,280.0 + 19,650.0 + 44,850.0 + 605,000.0 + 100,800.0 + 1,470,000.0 + 700,000.0 + 218,240.0 + 399,000.0 + 558,000.0 = 4,924,820.0\n     \\]\n   - Additionally, there are unpaid interest receivables:\n     - `Interest20240201032`: 49.75595374000001 (Unpaid)\n   - Total final current liabilities: \n     \\[\n     4,924,820.0 + 49.75595374000001 = 4,924,869.76\n     \\]\n\n3. **Format the Solution:**\n   - The initial current liabilities are 4,924,820.00.\n   - The final current liabilities are 4,924,869.76.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Liabilities Initial Value': '4924820.00', 'Total Current Liabilities End Value': '4924869.76'} }\n```",
