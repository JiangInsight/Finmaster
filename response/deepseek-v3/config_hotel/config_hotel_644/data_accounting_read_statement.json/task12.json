These are typically the current assets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Assets**: Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within one year or the operating cycle, whichever is longer. In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of all current assets.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The initial amount for \"Total Current Assets\" is `8000000.00` as of the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n   - **End Value**: The end amount for \"Total Current Assets\" is `10453882.43` as of the end date `2024-02-01`.\n\n3. **Verify Non-Current Assets**: The \"Total Non-current Assets\" are not part of the operating cycle and are not expected to be realized or consumed within the normal operating cycle. Therefore, they are excluded from the solution.\n\n4. **Total Assets**: The \"Total Assets\" include both current and non-current assets, but we are only interested in the current assets portion for this task.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10453882.43'}}\n```",
