This account records the interest income that has been earned but not yet received in cash.\n\n2. **Locate the Initial and End Values**:\n   - From the provided balance sheet, we can see the \"Interest Receivable\" line item with the following details:\n     - **Initial_amount**: 0.00 (as of the Initial_date: 2023-12-31)\n     - **End_amount**: 6494.02 (as of the End_date: 2024-02-01)\n\n3. **Extract the Required Values**:\n   - The initial value of interest accrued but not yet received is '0.00'.\n   - The end value of interest accrued but not yet received is '6494.02'.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '6494.02'} }\n```",
