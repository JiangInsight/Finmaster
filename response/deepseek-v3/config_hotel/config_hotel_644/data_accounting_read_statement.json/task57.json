This typically refers to the \"Accounts Payable\" line item in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: The amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit is recorded under \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n2. **Extract the Initial and End Amounts**: \n   - From the balance sheet, the \"Accounts Payable\" line shows:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: 5,596,070.00 (as of 2024-02-01)\n\n3. **Calculate the Addition in the Amount Owed**: \n   - The addition in the amount owed during the period is the difference between the end amount and the initial amount.\n   - Addition = End_amount - Initial_amount = 5,596,070.00 - 0.00 = 5,596,070.00\n\n4. **Verify with Cash Flow Statement**: \n   - The cash flow statement also shows the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" as 5,596,070.00, which confirms the addition in the amount owed.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is 5,596,070.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5596070.00'}}\n```",
