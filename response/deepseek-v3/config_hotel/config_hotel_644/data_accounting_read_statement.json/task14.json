These are typically classified as \"Current Liabilities\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Liabilities**: \n   - Current liabilities are obligations that are expected to be settled within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually within one year). \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Current Liabilities\" are:\n     - Accounts Payable\n     - Taxes Payable\n   - The total of these items is given under \"Total Current Liabilities\".\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `5637910.70` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-02-01`.\n\n3. **Verify**:\n   - The sum of the individual current liabilities (Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable) matches the \"Total Current Liabilities\":\n     - Accounts Payable: `5596070.00`\n     - Taxes Payable: `41840.70`\n     - Total: `5596070.00 + 41840.70 = 5637910.70` (matches the \"Total Current Liabilities\" value).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '5637910.70'}}\n```",
