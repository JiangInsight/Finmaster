These amounts are typically listed under \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet, as they represent the money owed to suppliers or vendors for credit purchases.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item that represents amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit is \"Accounts Payable\". This is the standard accounting term for such liabilities.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - From the given balance sheet, the \"Initial_amount\" for \"Accounts Payable\" is \"0.00\" as of the \"Initial_date\" \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Accounts Payable\" is \"5596070.00\" as of the \"End_date\" \"2024-02-01\".\n\n4. **Verify the Context**:\n   - The initial value is zero, indicating that at the start of the period (2023-12-31), the entity had no outstanding payables. By the end of the period (2024-02-01), the entity owed 5,596,070.00, which is the amount for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '5596070.00'} }\n```",
