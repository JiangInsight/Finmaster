This is typically referred to as \"Depreciation\" in financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding Depreciation**: Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. It appears in multiple parts of the financial statements:\n   - **Balance Sheet**: Under \"Accumulated Depreciation\" as a contra-asset account.\n   - **Cash Flow Statement**: Listed as \"Depreciation\" under cash flow from operating activities.\n   - **Income Statement**: Listed as \"Depreciation\" under expenses.\n\n2. **Locating Depreciation in the Given Problem**:\n   - In the **balance sheet**, \"Accumulated Depreciation\" has an end amount of `132103.78`. This represents the total depreciation accumulated up to the end date.\n   - In the **cash flow statement**, \"Depreciation\" is listed with an amount of `132103.78`. This is the depreciation expense for the period.\n   - In the **income statement**, \"Depreciation\" is listed with an amount of `132103.78`. This is the depreciation expense for the period.\n\n3. **Choosing the Correct Value**:\n   - The task asks for the \"systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life,\" which is the depreciation expense for the period. This is reflected in both the cash flow statement and the income statement as `132103.78`.\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" in the balance sheet is the cumulative total, not the periodic expense, so it is not the correct value for this task.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The correct value to extract is `132103.78`, which is the depreciation expense for the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '132103.78'}}\n```",
