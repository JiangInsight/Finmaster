                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line item and value of cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) and other long-term assets from the cash flow statement. \n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Cash Flow Statement Structure**: The cash flow statement is divided into three main sections: Operating Activities, Investing Activities, and Financing Activities. The line item we are interested in, which represents cash payments for PP&E and other long-term assets, typically falls under the \"Investing Activities\" section.\n\n2. **Locate the Investing Activities Section**: In the provided problem, the \"Investing Activities\" section is clearly labeled. Under this section, we look for line items that indicate purchases or acquisitions of fixed assets or long-term assets.\n\n3. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: In the example provided, the line item was labeled \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" and the corresponding value was the amount spent on these purchases. Similarly, in the problem to solve, we see the line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an amount of \"3415664.34\".\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is the amount we need to extract. This value represents the cash payments made to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\n5. **Verify the Context**: Ensure that the value is indeed under the \"Investing Activities\" section and is related to the acquisition of long-term assets. In this case, \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" clearly fits this description.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets is \"3415664.34\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3415664.34'} }\n```",
