I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the solution.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task is about analyzing a cash flow statement to extract specific information related to cash flows from investing activities. Here's what we need to do:\n\n1. **Identify the Net Amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents from Investing Activities**: This is the total cash generated or used in investing activities.\n2. **Break Down This Item into Sub-items**: We need to find one component that makes up this net amount. This sub-item should also come from the cash flow statement.\n3. **Provide the Values**: For both the main item and its sub-item, we need to extract their monetary values.\n\n### Given Cash Flow Statement\n\nLet's look at the provided cash flow statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-01 |\n| Net Profit  | 99532.29 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Depreciation  | 132103.78 | 2024-02-01 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -335639.38 | 2024-02-01 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -6494.02 | 2024-02-01 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -7446940.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 5596070.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 41840.70 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -1919526.63 | 2024-02-01 |\n| **Cash Flow from Investing Activities** |  | 2024-02-01 |\n| **Purchase of Fixed Assets**  | **3415664.34** | 2024-02-01 |\n| **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**  | **-3415664.34** | 2024-02-01 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-01 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Ending Balance  | 2664809.03 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Net Increase  | -5335190.97 | 2024-02-01 |\n\n### Identifying the Main Item\n\nFrom the task description, the main item we're interested in is:\n\n> \"the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends\"\n\nThis is essentially the **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**. \n\nLooking at the table, we see:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: -3415664.34\n\nSo, the `value` in our solution is `-3415664.34`.\n\n### Identifying Sub-items\n\nNow, we need to decompose this net amount into one sub-item. \n\nFrom the table, under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" there's only one line item before the net cash flow:\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: 3415664.34\n\nThis is a clear sub-item that contributes to the net cash flow from investing activities. \n\nIn this case, the net cash flow is solely composed of the purchase of fixed assets (since it's the only item listed), and it's negative because purchasing assets is a cash outflow.\n\nSo, the `sub_item value` is `3415664.34`.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-305354.43', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '305354.43'}}}\n```\n\nIn the example:\n- The main value is \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": -305354.43\n- The sub-item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": 305354.43\n\nThis matches our current scenario where:\n- Main value: -3415664.34\n- Sub-item: 3415664.34\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-3415664.34', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '3415664.34'}}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Locate Investing Activities Section**: Found under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n2. **Identify Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: -3415664.34 (this is our main `value`).\n3. **Find Sub-items Under Investing Activities**: Only \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is listed with a value of 3415664.34 (this is our `sub_item value`).\n4. **Confirm Negative Sign**: Purchasing assets is an outflow, hence the negative net cash flow.\n5. **Structure the Answer**: Follow the given JSON format with the identified values.\n\nThus, the solution is correctly derived from the provided cash flow statement.",
