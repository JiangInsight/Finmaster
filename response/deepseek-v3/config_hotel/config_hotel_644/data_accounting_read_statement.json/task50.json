                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to identify and extract the four specific line items from the cash flow statement based on the descriptions provided. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to find four specific items in the cash flow statement:\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is typically referred to as \"Depreciation\" in the cash flow statement.\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period**: This usually corresponds to changes in \"Inventory\".\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends**: This is generally the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Cash Flow Statement\nLet's go through the provided cash flow statement and pick out these items.\n\n1. **Depreciation**:\n   - Looking at the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, we see \"Depreciation\" with an amount of \"132103.78\".\n\n2. **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**:\n   - In the same section, there's \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with an amount of \"-7446940.00\". \n   - The negative sign indicates an increase in inventory (since it's an outflow), which aligns with the description of a reduction in assets held for sale.\n\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - Under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\", there's \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with an amount of \"-3415664.34\".\n\n4. **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n   - In the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, \"Net Increase\" is listed as \"-5335190.97\".\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nLooking back at the example provided:\n- 'value1' was \"Depreciation\".\n- 'value2' was \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\".\n- 'value3' was \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n- 'value4' was \"Net Increase\".\n\nThis matches our understanding.\n\n### Final Extraction\nNow, let's extract the corresponding values from the problem statement:\n1. Depreciation: 132103.78\n2. (Increase) Decrease in Inventory: -7446940.00\n3. Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -3415664.34\n4. Net Increase: -5335190.97\n\n### Formatting the Answer\nThe solution should be presented in JSON format with the values as strings (enclosed in quotes).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '132103.78', 'value2': '-7446940.00', 'value3': '-3415664.34', 'value4': '-5335190.97'} }\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '132103.78', 'value2': '-7446940.00', 'value3': '-3415664.34', 'value4': '-5335190.97'} }\n```",
