This is typically labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, we can see the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an amount of \"41840.70\".\n3. **Verify the Context**: This line item is indeed under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, which is the correct section for such adjustments related to accrued taxes.\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with this line item is \"41840.70\", which represents the increase in tax payable (i.e., tax accrued but not yet paid).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '41840.70'}}\n```",
