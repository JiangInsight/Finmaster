                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line item and value that represents the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit during the period. This is typically reflected in the \"Accounts Receivable\" line item in the cash flow statement under the \"Operating Activities\" section.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Line Item**: The line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" indicates changes in the amounts owed by customers for goods or services sold on credit. A decrease in accounts receivable means that the entity has collected more cash from customers than the sales made on credit during the period, which is a positive cash flow. Conversely, an increase (shown as a negative value) means less cash was collected than the sales on credit, which is a negative cash flow.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the given problem, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is present under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with this line item is \"-335639.38\". This negative value indicates an increase in accounts receivable, meaning the amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit have increased during the period. However, the task asks for the \"decrease\" in amounts owed, so we would look for a positive value. Since the value is negative, it represents an increase, not a decrease. But the task might be asking for the value regardless of its sign, as it is the line item that tracks changes in amounts owed.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The value to be extracted is \"-335639.38\".\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-335639.38'}}\n```",
