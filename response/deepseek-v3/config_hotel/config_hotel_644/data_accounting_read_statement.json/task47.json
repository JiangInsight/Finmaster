                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand how to find the net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period, and then identify its two component sub-items from the given cash flow statement.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's recall what a cash flow statement shows. It provides information about the cash inflows and outflows of a company during a specific period. The statement is divided into three main sections:\n\n1. **Operating Activities**: Cash flows from the primary business operations.\n2. **Investing Activities**: Cash flows from the purchase and sale of long-term assets.\n3. **Financing Activities**: Cash flows from transactions with owners and creditors (though this section isn't present in the given data).\n\nAt the bottom of the cash flow statement, there's usually a section that shows the changes in cash and cash equivalents, which includes:\n\n- **Beginning Balance**: The amount of cash at the start of the period.\n- **Ending Balance**: The amount of cash at the end of the period.\n- **Net Increase/Decrease**: The difference between the ending and beginning balances, showing how much cash increased or decreased during the period.\n\n### Identifying the Net Addition in Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nFrom the given data, under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, we have:\n\n- Beginning Balance: 8,000,000.00\n- Ending Balance: 2,664,809.03\n- Net Increase: -5,335,190.97\n\nThe \"Net Increase\" here represents the net addition (or in this case, a decrease) in cash and cash equivalents during the period. \n\nSo, the value we're looking for is **-5,335,190.97**.\n\n### Decomposing the Net Increase into Two Sub-items\n\nThe net increase is calculated as:\n\n**Net Increase = Ending Balance - Beginning Balance**\n\nTherefore, the two sub-items that make up the net increase are:\n\n1. **Ending Balance**: 2,664,809.03\n2. **Beginning Balance**: 8,000,000.00\n\nThese are the two components directly involved in calculating the net increase in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the provided example:\n\n- Net Increase: -7,565,348.53\n- Sub-items:\n  - sub_item value1 (Beginning Balance): 8,000,000.00\n  - sub_item value2 (Ending Balance): 434,651.47\n\nThis matches our understanding, where:\n\n-7,565,348.53 = 434,651.47 - 8,000,000.00\n\n### Final Answer\n\nApplying this to our problem:\n\n- **value (Net Increase)**: -5,335,190.97\n- **sub_item value1 (Beginning Balance)**: 8,000,000.00\n- **sub_item value2 (Ending Balance)**: 2,664,809.03\n\nSo, the solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-5335190.97', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '2664809.03'} }\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Locate the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section** in the cash flow statement.\n2. **Identify the Net Increase/Decrease** value, which is the net addition to cash and cash equivalents (-5,335,190.97).\n3. **Determine the two sub-items** used to calculate the net increase:\n   - Beginning Balance (8,000,000.00)\n   - Ending Balance (2,664,809.03)\n4. **Verify the calculation**: \n   - 2,664,809.03 (Ending) - 8,000,000.00 (Beginning) = -5,335,190.97 (Net Increase)\n5. **Format the answer** as specified in the JSON structure.\n\nThis ensures that we've correctly identified and decomposed the net addition in cash and cash equivalents from the provided cash flow statement.",
