This information is typically found under \"Retained Earnings\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Line Item**: The line item we are interested in is \"Retained Earnings,\" which represents the cumulative profits or losses retained in the entity after any distributions to shareholders.\n\n2. **Locate Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The initial amount for \"Retained Earnings\" is given as `0.00` on the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n   - **End Value**: The end amount for \"Retained Earnings\" is given as `99532.29` on the end date `2024-02-01`.\n\n3. **Verify the Data**: \n   - The initial value of \"Retained Earnings\" is `0.00`, indicating no retained earnings at the start of the period.\n   - The end value of \"Retained Earnings\" is `99532.29`, indicating a positive retained earnings (profit) at the end of the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '99532.29'} }\n```",
