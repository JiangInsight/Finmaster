The relevant line item is \"Taxes Payable,\" which represents the taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Line Item**: \n   - Look for the account labeled \"Taxes Payable\" in the balance sheet. This account shows the amount of taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\" is `41840.70` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-02-01`.\n\n4. **Construct the Solution**:\n   - The initial value is `0.00`, and the end value is `41840.70`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '41840.70'} }\n```",
