The four items are:\n\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received**: This is typically listed as \"Interest Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n2. **Accumulated depreciation**: This is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life, listed as \"Accumulated Depreciation\".\n3. **Tax payable**: This is the amount of taxes owed but not yet paid, listed as \"Taxes Payable\".\n4. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is the amount of capital initially invested by shareholders, listed as \"Paid-in Capital\".\n\nNow, let's extract the initial and end amounts for each of these line items from the given balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Extraction:\n\n1. **Interest Receivable**:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - End_amount: 6494.02\n\n2. **Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - End_amount: 132103.78\n\n3. **Taxes Payable**:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - End_amount: 41840.70\n\n4. **Paid-in Capital**:\n   - Initial_amount: 16000000.00\n   - End_amount: 16000000.00\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '0.00', 'end valu1': '6494.02', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '132103.78', 'initial value3': '0.00', 'end valu3': '41840.70', 'initial value4': '16000000.00', 'end valu4': '16000000.00'} }\n```",
