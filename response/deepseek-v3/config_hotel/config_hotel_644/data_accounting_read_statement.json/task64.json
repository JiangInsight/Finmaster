                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement extraction task step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand what each of the three values we need to extract represents and where to find them in the given financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to identify and extract three specific line items from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under \"Paid-in Capital\" or similar equity accounts.\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is the \"Profit Before Tax\" line item, usually found in the Income Statement.\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This refers to the increase in \"Accounts Payable,\" which can be found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\"\n\nThe outputs should be grouped by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, we maintain the original line item order as shown in the input.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nLet's go through each financial statement provided in the problem to locate these items.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet section, we're interested in the capital contributed by shareholders. This is usually labeled as \"Paid-in Capital.\"\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n```\n| Paid-in Capital | 16000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 16000000.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n```\nHere, the \"End_amount\" for \"Paid-in Capital\" is `16000000.00`. This is our first value (`value1`).\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nNext, we need the profit or loss before tax. This is labeled as \"Profit Before Tax\" in the Income Statement.\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n```\n| Profit Before Tax | 141372.99 | 2024-02-01 |\n```\nThe amount here is `141372.99`. This is our second value (`value2`).\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nNow, we're looking for the increase in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services purchased on credit, which is the increase in \"Accounts Payable.\" This is found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\"\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n```\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 5596070.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n```\nThe amount here is `5596070.00`. This is our third value (`value3`).\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the provided example to ensure we're on the right track:\n\n- `value1` was \"Paid-in Capital\" from the Balance Sheet (`13000000.00`).\n- `value2` was \"Profit Before Tax\" from the Income Statement (`-1373590.51`).\n- `value3` was \"Increase in Accounts Payable\" from the Cash Flow Statement (`1590000.00`).\n\nThis matches our understanding, so our approach seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling the values we've identified:\n\n1. `value1` (Paid-in Capital from Balance Sheet): `16000000.00`\n2. `value2` (Profit Before Tax from Income Statement): `141372.99`\n3. `value3` (Increase in Accounts Payable from Cash Flow Statement): `5596070.00`\n\nPutting this into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16000000.00', 'value2': '141372.99', 'value3': '5596070.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Identify the three required line items**:\n   - Capital contributed by shareholders: \"Paid-in Capital\" in Balance Sheet.\n   - Profit before tax: \"Profit Before Tax\" in Income Statement.\n   - Increase in accounts payable: \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" in Cash Flow Statement.\n\n2. **Locate each in the respective financial statements**:\n   - Balance Sheet: Found \"Paid-in Capital\" with End_amount `16000000.00`.\n   - Income Statement: Found \"Profit Before Tax\" as `141372.99`.\n   - Cash Flow Statement: Found \"Increase in Accounts Payable\" as `5596070.00`.\n\n3. **Verify against the example** to ensure correct mapping of items.\n\n4. **Compile the values** in the specified JSON format.\n\nThus, the final solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16000000.00', 'value2': '141372.99', 'value3': '5596070.00'}}\n```",
