These are usually listed under current assets in the balance sheet.\n\n2. **Locating the Initial Amounts**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, under the \"Initial_amount\" column, we find:\n     - \"Cash on Hand\": 3000000.00\n     - \"Bank Deposits\": 5000000.00\n\n3. **Calculating Total Cash and Cash Equivalents at the Beginning of the Period**:\n   - The total cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period is the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\".\n   - Calculation: 3000000.00 (Cash on Hand) + 5000000.00 (Bank Deposits) = 8000000.00\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - The \"Beginning Balance\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section in the cash flow statement also shows 8000000.00, which confirms our calculation.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period is 8000000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
