In the given problem, this is \"Main Business Revenue\" with the value \"836813.79\".\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is typically the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) line item, as it represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the entity. In the given problem, this is \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with the value \"544970.00\".\n\nThe order of the values in the solution should match the order in which these line items appear in the income statement. \n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Scan the income statement for the line item representing core operating income: \"Main Business Revenue\" → \"836813.79\".\n2. Scan the income statement for the line item representing the carrying amount of inventories sold: \"Cost of Goods Sold\" → \"544970.00\".\n3. Since \"Main Business Revenue\" appears before \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the statement, the values should be ordered as 'value1': '836813.79', 'value2': '544970.00'.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '836813.79', 'value2': '544970.00'} }\n```",
