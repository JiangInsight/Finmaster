In the balance sheet, expenses are often reflected through items like \"Accumulated Depreciation\" or other similar accounts that represent the allocation of costs over time.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is a clear expense-related item. It represents the total depreciation expense accumulated over time for fixed assets. This is an expense that would appear in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n3. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The initial amount for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is given as `0.00` as of the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n   - **End Value**: The end amount for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is given as `132103.78` as of the end date `2024-02-01`.\n\n4. **Verify**: The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is the only expense-related item in the balance sheet that directly affects the profit or loss statement through depreciation expense. Other items like \"Taxes Payable\" are liabilities and not expenses in this context.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '132103.78'} }\n```",
