These items are typically classified as \"Fixed Assets\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: \n   - From the given balance sheet, the line item that represents tangible assets held for use in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes is \"Fixed Assets\". This is because fixed assets include property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) which are used in operations.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The initial amount for \"Fixed Assets\" is listed as `8000000.00` as of the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n   - **End Value**: The end amount for \"Fixed Assets\" is listed as `11415664.34` as of the end date `2024-02-01`.\n\n3. **Verify Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item shows the depreciation charged on these fixed assets. However, the task asks for the gross value of the tangible assets (before depreciation), so we use the \"Fixed Assets\" line directly.\n\n4. **Final Values**:\n   - The initial value of the tangible assets is `8000000.00`.\n   - The end value of the tangible assets is `11415664.34`.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '11415664.34'}}\n```",
