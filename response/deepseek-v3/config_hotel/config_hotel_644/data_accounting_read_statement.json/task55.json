This represents the tax liability at the end of the reporting period.\n\n3. **Check the Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - In the cash flow statement, there is a line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an amount of `41840.70`. This represents the change in tax payable during the reporting period.\n\n4. **Check the Income Statement**:\n   - In the income statement, there is a line item \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of `41840.70`. This represents the tax expense incurred during the reporting period.\n\n5. **Consistency Across Statements**:\n   - The tax amount is consistent across all three statements (`41840.70`), which confirms that this is the correct value for the total amount of tax expected to be paid or recovered during the reporting period.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe total amount of tax expected to be paid or recovered during the reporting period is `41840.70`.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '41840.70'}}\n```",
