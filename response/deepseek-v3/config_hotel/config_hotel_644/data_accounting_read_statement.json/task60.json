Since we only need values from the Balance Sheet and Income Statement, we ignore the Cash Flow Statement for this task.\n   - Within each group, maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '559055.66', 'value2': '6494.02'}}\n```",
