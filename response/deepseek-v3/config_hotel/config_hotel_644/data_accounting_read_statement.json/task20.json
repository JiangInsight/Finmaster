COGS represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, including the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the goods.\n\n2. **Identifying the Line Item**: In the given income statement, the line item labeled \"Cost of Goods Sold\" directly corresponds to the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period. \n\n3. **Extracting the Value**: The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the income statement is `544970.00`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '544970.00'} }\n```",
