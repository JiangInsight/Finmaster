This typically corresponds to the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" line item in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task asks for the value of the reduction in assets held for sale, which includes inventory. In the cash flow statement, changes in inventory are usually reported under operating activities.\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" is present under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\".\n3. **Extract the Value**: The amount associated with \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" is \"-7446940.00\". A negative value indicates an increase in inventory (which is a reduction in cash flow), but the absolute value represents the reduction in the amount of assets held for sale.\n4. **Format the Answer**: The solution should be presented in the specified JSON format with the extracted value.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-7446940.00'}}\n```",
