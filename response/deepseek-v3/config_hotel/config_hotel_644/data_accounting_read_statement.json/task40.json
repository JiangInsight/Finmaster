This is typically reflected in the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" line item in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are looking for the increase in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit. This is captured by the \"Accounts Payable\" line item in the cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is present under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is \"5596070.00\". This represents the increase in accounts payable during the period, indicating the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The value is positive, which aligns with an increase in accounts payable (i.e., the entity owes more at the end of the period than at the beginning).\n\n5. **Final Answer**: The value to be extracted is \"5596070.00\".\n\nHere is the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5596070.00'}}\n```",
