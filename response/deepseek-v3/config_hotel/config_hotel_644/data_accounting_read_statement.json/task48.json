In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Net Profit.\"\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This represents cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets. In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nFrom the given problem:\n- The \"Net Profit\" is listed as 99532.29.\n- The \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is listed as 3415664.34.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '99532.29', 'value2': '3415664.34'} }\n```",
