In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Net Profit.\"\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This represents cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets. In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nFrom the given problem, we can locate these two line items and their corresponding amounts:\n\n- **Net Profit**: 111731.83\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: 2496137.92\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '111731.83', 'value2': '2496137.92'} }\n```",
