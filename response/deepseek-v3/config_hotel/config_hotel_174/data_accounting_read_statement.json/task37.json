This line item is typically labeled as \"Depreciation\" in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task is to find the value associated with the depreciation expense in the cash flow statement. Depreciation represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, look for the line item labeled \"Depreciation\" under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value corresponding to the \"Depreciation\" line item is the amount we need to extract.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided Problem:\n- The cash flow statement includes a line item \"Depreciation\" with the amount \"117540.62\" and the date \"2024-02-03\".\n- This is the value we need to extract as it represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '117540.62'}}\n```",
