                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line item and value that represents the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit during the period. This is typically reflected in the \"Accounts Receivable\" line item in the cash flow statement under \"Operating Activities.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are looking for the line item that shows the change in accounts receivable, which indicates the decrease (or increase) in amounts owed to the entity for credit sales or services provided.\n\n2. **Identify the Line Item**: In the cash flow statement provided, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" represents this information. A negative value here indicates an increase in accounts receivable (meaning more amounts are owed to the entity), while a positive value would indicate a decrease (meaning less amounts are owed to the entity).\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: From the given problem, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" has a value of \"-248540.09\". This negative value indicates an increase in accounts receivable, but the task asks for the \"decrease\" in amounts owed. Since the value is negative, it means there was no decrease; instead, there was an increase. However, the task is to extract the value as it appears in the statement, regardless of whether it represents an increase or decrease.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The value to be extracted is \"-248540.09\".\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-248540.09'}}\n```",
