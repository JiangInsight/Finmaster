This account represents the interest that has been earned but not yet received. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Value**: \n   - In the balance sheet, under the \"Interest Receivable\" account, the \"Initial_amount\" is listed as \"0.00\" with the \"Initial_date\" of \"2023-12-31\".\n\n2. **End Value**: \n   - The \"End_amount\" for the \"Interest Receivable\" account is \"5264.70\" with the \"End_date\" of \"2024-02-03\".\n\nThus, the initial value is \"0.00\" and the end value is \"5264.70\".\n\nThe solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '5264.70'} }\n```",
