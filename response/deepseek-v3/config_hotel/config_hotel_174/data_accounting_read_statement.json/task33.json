In the given problem, this is \"Main Business Revenue\" with the value \"791992.51\".\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) line item, as it reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company. In the given problem, this is \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with the value \"504930.00\".\n\nThe order of the values in the solution should match the order in which these line items appear in the income statement. \n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n1. Identify \"Main Business Revenue\" (core operating income) and its value: \"791992.51\".\n2. Identify \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (carrying amount of inventories sold) and its value: \"504930.00\".\n3. Assign these values to 'value1' and 'value2' respectively, maintaining the original order.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '791992.51', 'value2': '504930.00'} }\n```",
