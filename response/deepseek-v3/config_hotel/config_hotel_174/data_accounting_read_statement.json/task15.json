The equity is typically represented by \"Total Owner's Equity\" in the balance sheet. \n\nFrom the provided problem, we can see the following line items:\n\n1. **Paid-in Capital**: \n   - Initial_amount: 16000000.00\n   - End_amount: 16000000.00\n\n2. **Retained Earnings**: \n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - End_amount: 111731.83\n\n3. **Total Owner's Equity**: \n   - Initial_amount: 16000000.00\n   - End_amount: 16111731.83\n\nThe \"Total Owner's Equity\" is the sum of \"Paid-in Capital\" and \"Retained Earnings,\" and it represents the total equity recognized in the statement of financial position. \n\nThus, the initial value of total equity is '16000000.00', and the end value is '16111731.83'.\n\nHere is the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '16000000.00', 'end value': '16111731.83'} }\n```",
