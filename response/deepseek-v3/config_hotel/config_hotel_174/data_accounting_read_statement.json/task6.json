These items are typically classified as \"Fixed Assets\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - From the given balance sheet, the line item that represents tangible assets held for use in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes is \"Fixed Assets\".\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Fixed Assets\" is provided as `8000000.00` on the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Fixed Assets\" is provided as `10496137.92` on the end date `2024-02-03`.\n\n4. **Verify Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is listed separately, but the \"Fixed Assets\" value already reflects the net value (after depreciation) since the \"Total Non-current Assets\" is calculated as `Fixed Assets - Accumulated Depreciation`. However, the task asks for the value of the tangible items themselves, not the net value after depreciation. Therefore, we should use the \"Fixed Assets\" value directly.\n\n5. **Final Values**:\n   - Initial value: `8000000.00`\n   - End value: `10496137.92`\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10496137.92'} }\n```",
