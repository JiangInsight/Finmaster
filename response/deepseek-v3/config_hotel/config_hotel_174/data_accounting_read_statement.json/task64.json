                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we need.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific values from the financial statements:\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under \"Paid-in Capital\" or similar.\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is usually the \"Profit Before Tax\" line in the Income Statement.\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This is the increase in \"Accounts Payable\" which can be found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n\nThe order to present them is:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet - Capital Contributed by Shareholders\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, we have:\n```\nPaid-in Capital | 16000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 16000000.00 | 2024-02-03\n```\nThis represents the capital contributed by shareholders. The initial and end amounts are the same, indicating no new capital was added during this period. However, the initial amount is what was contributed, so we'll take the initial amount: **16000000.00**.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, they took the initial amount as well (13000000.00). So, seems correct.\n\n### 2. Income Statement - Profit Before Tax\nFrom the Income Statement:\n```\nProfit Before Tax | 151331.49 | 2024-02-03\n```\nThis is the profit before tax expense is deducted. So, the value is **151331.49**.\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement - Increase in Accounts Payable\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n```\nIncrease (Decrease) in Accounts Payable | 3350120.00 | 2024-02-03\n```\nThis shows the increase in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services purchased on credit during the period. So, the value is **3350120.00**.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nIn the example provided:\n- 'value1' was '13000000.00' (Paid-in Capital from Balance Sheet)\n- 'value2' was '-1373590.51' (Profit Before Tax from Income Statement)\n- 'value3' was '1590000.00' (Increase in Accounts Payable from Cash Flow)\n\nThis matches our approach.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together:\n- value1 (Paid-in Capital): '16000000.00'\n- value2 (Profit Before Tax): '151331.49'\n- value3 (Increase in Accounts Payable): '3350120.00'\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16000000.00', 'value2': '151331.49', 'value3': '3350120.00'}}\n```",
