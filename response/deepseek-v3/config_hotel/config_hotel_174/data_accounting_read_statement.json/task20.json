This is because COGS reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, including the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the goods.\n\n2. **Identifying the Line Item**: In the given income statement, the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is present with an amount of \"504930.00\".\n\n3. **Verifying the Line Item**: There are no other line items that could represent the carrying amount of inventories sold (e.g., \"Inventory Sold\" or \"Cost of Sales\"). The \"Total Cost\" line item is also present, but it is the same as the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in this case, indicating that COGS is the primary cost component.\n\n4. **Extracting the Value**: The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is \"504930.00\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '504930.00'}}\n```",
