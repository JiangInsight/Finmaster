                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through the income statement provided and identify the three specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific pieces of information from the income statement:\n\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**: This typically refers to the total revenue generated from the main operations of the business. In income statements, this is often labeled as \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is essentially the cost associated with the goods that were sold during the period. It's commonly referred to as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**: These are the administrative expenses incurred in running the business. They're usually listed as \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n\n### Analyzing the Given Income Statement\nLet's look at the provided income statement line by line to find these items.\n\nHere's the income statement again for reference:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 791992.51 | 2024-02-03 |\n| Total Revenue | 791992.51 | 2024-02-03 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 504930.00 | 2024-02-03 |\n| Total Cost | 504930.00 | 2024-02-03 |\n| Gross Profit | 287062.51 | 2024-02-03 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 10432.67 | 2024-02-03 |\n| Selling Expenses | 9828.84 | 2024-02-03 |\n| Depreciation | 117540.62 | 2024-02-03 |\n| Financial Expenses | 3193.59 | 2024-02-03 |\n| Total Expenses | 140995.72 | 2024-02-03 |\n| Interest Income | 5264.70 | 2024-02-03 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 151331.49 | 2024-02-03 |\n| Tax Expense | 39599.66 | 2024-02-03 |\n| Net Profit | 111731.83 | 2024-02-03 |\n\n### Identifying the Required Line Items\n\n1. **Total income arising from ordinary activities**:\n   - This is the revenue from the main business operations.\n   - We see \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\" both with the same amount: 791992.51.\n   - Typically, \"Total Revenue\" is the comprehensive term, but since both are equal here, either could represent the total income. However, \"Total Revenue\" is more encompassing.\n   - **Value**: 791992.51\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold (Cost of Goods Sold)**:\n   - This is directly labeled as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with a value of 504930.00.\n   - **Value**: 504930.00\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration**:\n   - These are the \"Administrative Expenses,\" listed as 10432.67.\n   - **Value**: 10432.67\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nLooking back at the provided example:\n\n- 'value1' was \"Total Revenue\" (5431018.59)\n- 'value2' was \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (4410000.00)\n- 'value3' was \"Administrative Expenses\" (1425164.20)\n\nThis confirms our approach is correct:\n1. Total income → Total Revenue\n2. Inventories sold → Cost of Goods Sold\n3. Administration costs → Administrative Expenses\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the above reasoning, the values are:\n\n- value1 (Total Revenue): 791992.51\n- value2 (Cost of Goods Sold): 504930.00\n- value3 (Administrative Expenses): 10432.67\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '791992.51', 'value2': '504930.00', 'value3': '10432.67'} }\n```",
