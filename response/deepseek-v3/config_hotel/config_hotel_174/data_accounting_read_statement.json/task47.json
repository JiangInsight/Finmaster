                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand how to find the net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period, and then identify its two component sub-items from the given cash flow statement.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's recall what the cash flow statement shows. It provides information about the cash inflows and outflows of a company during a specific period, categorized into three main activities:\n1. **Operating Activities**: Cash generated or used in the core business operations.\n2. **Investing Activities**: Cash used for or generated from investments like buying or selling assets.\n3. **Financing Activities**: Cash from or used in financing the business, like issuing stocks or paying dividends.\n\nHowever, in the given problem, we don't have the \"Financing Activities\" section, but we do have \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" which shows the beginning and ending balances along with the net increase or decrease.\n\n### Identifying the Net Addition in Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe \"net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\" is essentially the change in cash from the beginning to the end of the period. This is directly given in the statement as \"Net Increase\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section.\n\nFrom the problem:\n- **Net Increase**: -7000890.60\n\nSo, the net addition (which is a decrease in this case) is -7000890.60.\n\n### Decomposing the Net Addition into Two Sub-items\n\nThe net increase or decrease in cash is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Net Increase} = \\text{Ending Balance} - \\text{Beginning Balance} \\]\n\nTherefore, the two sub-items that make up the net addition are:\n1. **Beginning Balance**: The cash and cash equivalents at the start of the period.\n2. **Ending Balance**: The cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period.\n\nFrom the problem:\n- **Beginning Balance**: 8000000.00\n- **Ending Balance**: 999109.40\n\nLet's verify:\n\\[ \\text{Net Increase} = 999109.40 - 8000000.00 = -7000890.60 \\]\nThis matches the given \"Net Increase\" value.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example to ensure I'm on the right track:\n- **Net Increase**: -7565348.53\n- **Beginning Balance**: 8000000.00\n- **Ending Balance**: 434651.47\nCalculation:\n\\[ 434651.47 - 8000000.00 = -7565348.53 \\]\nThis matches, and the solution was:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-7565348.53', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_item value2': '434651.47'}}}\n```\n\n### Finalizing the Answer for the Given Problem\n\nNow, applying the same to the current problem:\n- **value (Net Increase)**: -7000890.60\n- **sub_item value1 (Beginning Balance)**: 8000000.00\n- **sub_item value2 (Ending Balance)**: 999109.40\n\n### Formatting the Answer\n\nThe solution should be in the following JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '______', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '______', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '______'} }\n```\n\nHowever, looking at the example, the sub_items are nested within a 'sub_items' dictionary. But the instruction seems to suggest a slightly different format where 'sub_items_' is prefixed to the sub_item keys directly under 'solution'. \n\nAssuming the exact format from the instruction (which seems to flatten the sub_items with prefixes), the correct format would be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-7000890.60', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '999109.40'}}\n```\n\nBut to match the example's nested structure, it should be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-7000890.60', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_item value2': '999109.40'}}}\n```\n\nGiven the instruction's format seems to differ slightly from the example, I'll follow the instruction's format where sub_items are prefixed directly under 'solution'.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-7000890.60', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '999109.40'}}\n```",
