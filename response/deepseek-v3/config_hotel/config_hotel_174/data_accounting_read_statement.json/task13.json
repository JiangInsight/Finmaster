These are typically non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets and other long-term investments.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Criteria**: The task asks for assets not expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal operating cycle. These are non-current assets, which are held for long-term use and not for conversion into cash within a year.\n\n2. **Identify Non-Current Assets in the Balance Sheet**: \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Total Non-current Assets\" are \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation.\" \n   - The \"Total Non-current Assets\" is the net value after accounting for depreciation.\n\n3. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Non-current Assets\" is `8000000.00` as of the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Non-current Assets\" is `10378597.30` as of the end date `2024-02-03`.\n\n4. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The \"Fixed Assets\" initial value is `8000000.00`, and the end value is `10496137.92`.\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" initial value is `0.00`, and the end value is `117540.62`.\n   - The net \"Total Non-current Assets\" is calculated as `Fixed Assets - Accumulated Depreciation`:\n     - Initial: `8000000.00 - 0.00 = 8000000.00`\n     - End: `10496137.92 - 117540.62 = 10378597.30`\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The initial value of non-current assets is `8000000.00`.\n   - The end value of non-current assets is `10378597.30`.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10378597.30'} }\n```",
