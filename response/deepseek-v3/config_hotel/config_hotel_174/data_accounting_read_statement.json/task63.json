It is found under \"Taxes Payable\" in the Balance Sheet.\n2. **Total Revenue (Income Statement)**: This is the total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities. It is found under \"Total Revenue\" in the Income Statement.\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities (Cash Flow Statement)**: This is the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's principal revenue-producing activities and other activities that are not investing or financing activities. It is found under \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nLet's extract these values step by step:\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**:\n   - **Taxes Payable**: The end amount is `39599.66`.\n\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - **Total Revenue**: The amount is `791992.51`.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: The amount is `-4504752.68`.\n\nNow, we can compile these values into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '39599.66', 'value2': '791992.51', 'value3': '-4504752.68'}}\n```",
