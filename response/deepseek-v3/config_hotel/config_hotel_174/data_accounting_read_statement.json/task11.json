This is typically found under \"Retained Earnings\" in the balance sheet. \n\nFrom the given problem, we can see the following entries for \"Retained Earnings\":\n- Initial_amount: 0.00 (Initial_date: 2023-12-31)\n- End_amount: 111731.83 (End_date: 2024-02-03)\n\nThe \"Retained Earnings\" line item shows the cumulative profits or losses retained in the entity. The initial value is the amount at the start of the period, and the end value is the amount at the end of the period.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '111731.83'} }\n```",
