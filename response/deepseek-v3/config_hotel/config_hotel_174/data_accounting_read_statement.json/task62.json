                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand what each of the three values we need to extract represents and where to find them in the given financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to identify and extract three specific line items from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit**: This typically refers to \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet. It's the money that customers owe the company for sales made on credit.\n   \n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually labeled as \"Financial Expenses\" in the income statement. These are costs like interest on loans or other financing charges.\n   \n3. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is often found in the cash flow statement under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" or similar, representing cash spent on buying long-term assets.\n\nThe order to present these is:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nLet's go through each financial statement one by one to find these items.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, we have the following line items under \"Account\":\n\n- Cash on Hand\n- Bank Deposits\n- Interest Receivable\n- Accounts Receivable\n- Inventory\n- ... and so on.\n\nThe one we're interested in is \"Accounts Receivable\". \n\nFrom the table:\n- Accounts Receivable: End_amount = 248540.09\n\nSo, `value1` is \"248540.09\".\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nNow, let's look at the income statement. The relevant line items are:\n\n- Main Business Revenue\n- Total Revenue\n- Cost of Goods Sold\n- ...\n- Financial Expenses\n- ...\n\nWe're looking for \"Financial Expenses\".\n\nFrom the table:\n- Financial Expenses: Amount = 3193.59\n\nSo, `value2` is \"3193.59\".\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nFinally, the cash flow statement. Relevant line items:\n\n- Cash Flow From Operating Activities\n- ...\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets\n- ...\n\nWe need \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n\nFrom the table:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: Amount = 2496137.92\n\nSo, `value3` is \"2496137.92\".\n\n### Verifying the Values\n\nLet me quickly verify each:\n\n1. **Accounts Receivable**: Yes, it's the amount customers owe, and the end amount is 248540.09.\n2. **Financial Expenses**: Correct, it's listed as 3193.59 under expenses related to financing.\n3. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: Yes, this is the cash outflow for long-term assets, and the amount is 2496137.92.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '248540.09', 'value2': '3193.59', 'value3': '2496137.92'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Identify the three required items**:\n   - Accounts Receivable (Balance Sheet)\n   - Financial Expenses (Income Statement)\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets (Cash Flow Statement)\n\n2. **Locate each in the respective statements**:\n   - Accounts Receivable: Balance Sheet → End_amount = 248540.09\n   - Financial Expenses: Income Statement → Amount = 3193.59\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: Cash Flow Statement → Amount = 2496137.92\n\n3. **Construct the JSON output** with these values in the specified order.\n\nThis method ensures that we accurately identify and extract the correct figures from the appropriate financial statements.",
