This typically falls under \"Selling Expenses\" in an income statement, as these expenses are directly tied to sales and distribution activities.\n\n2. **Analyze the Given Income Statement**: \n   - Look for the line item labeled \"Selling Expenses\" in the provided income statement.\n   - In the given problem, \"Selling Expenses\" is listed with an amount of \"9828.84\" for the date \"2024-02-03\".\n\n3. **Verify the Choice**: \n   - \"Selling Expenses\" are indeed the costs associated with activities like advertising, sales commissions, and delivery, which align with the task's description.\n   - Other line items like \"Administrative Expenses\" or \"Cost of Goods Sold\" do not fit this description as they represent different types of costs.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: \n   - The value corresponding to \"Selling Expenses\" is \"9828.84\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '9828.84'} }\n```",
