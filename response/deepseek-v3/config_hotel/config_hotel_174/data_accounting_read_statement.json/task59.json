I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the answers.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe have three financial statements provided:\n1. **Balance Sheet**\n2. **Income Statement**\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**\n\nWe need to extract two specific pieces of information:\n1. The amount of **interest accrued but not yet received**.\n2. The **net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**.\n\nThese values should be grouped by the financial statement in the order mentioned (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement), and within each group, maintain the original line item order as shown in the input.\n\nFrom the example provided, it seems:\n- `value1` corresponds to the \"interest accrued but not yet received\".\n- `value2` corresponds to the \"net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\".\n\n### Identifying the Required Line Items\n\n**1. Interest Accrued but Not Yet Received:**\nThis is typically found as \"Interest Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet. It represents interest that has been earned but not yet received in cash.\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet:\n- There's a line item \"Interest Receivable\" with an \"End_amount\" of \"5264.70\".\n\nThis seems to be the interest accrued but not yet received.\n\n**2. Net Addition in the Amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents During the Period:**\nThis is usually found in the Cash Flow Statement under a line like \"Net Increase\" or \"Net Decrease\" in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nLooking at the Cash Flow Statement:\n- Under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\", there's \"Net Increase\" with an amount of \"-7000890.60\".\n\nThis represents the net change in cash and cash equivalents during the period (a decrease in this case, as it's negative).\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nIn the example provided:\n- `value1` was \"2672.87\", which matched the \"Interest Receivable\" from the Balance Sheet.\n- `value2` was \"-7565348.53\", which matched the \"Net Increase\" from the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThis confirms our approach.\n\n### Extracting the Values from the Given Problem\n\nFrom the provided problem:\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n- Interest Receivable: End_amount = \"5264.70\"\n\n**Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Increase: Amount = \"-7000890.60\"\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5264.70', 'value2': '-7000890.60'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Identify Interest Accrued but Not Received:**\n   - Look for \"Interest Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet.\n   - Found: \"5264.70\".\n\n2. **Identify Net Addition in Cash and Cash Equivalents:**\n   - Look for \"Net Increase\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n   - Found: \"-7000890.60\".\n\n3. **Construct the JSON output:**\n   - `value1`: \"5264.70\"\n   - `value2`: \"-7000890.60\"\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5264.70', 'value2': '-7000890.60'}}\n```",
