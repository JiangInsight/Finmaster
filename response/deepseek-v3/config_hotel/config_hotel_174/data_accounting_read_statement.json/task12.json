These are typically the current assets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Assets**: Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within one year or the operating cycle of the business, whichever is longer. In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of all current assets.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The initial value of total current assets is given as \"8000000.00\" on the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n   - **End Value**: The end value of total current assets is given as \"9122854.19\" on the end date \"2024-02-03\".\n\n3. **Verify Non-Current Assets**: The task specifies to focus on assets expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal operating cycle, which excludes non-current assets like \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation\".\n\n4. **Total Assets Context**: While the balance sheet provides \"Total Assets\" (which includes both current and non-current assets), the task specifically asks for the portion related to the operating cycle, which is the \"Total Current Assets\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '9122854.19'} }\n```",
