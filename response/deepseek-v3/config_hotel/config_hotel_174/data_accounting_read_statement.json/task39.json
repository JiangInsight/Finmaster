A negative value here indicates a decrease in inventory (i.e., a reduction in assets held for sale or in production), which is what we are looking for.\n\nFrom the provided problem, the relevant line is:\n```\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -7869940.00 | 2024-02-03 |\n```\n\nThe value here is `-7869940.00`, which indicates a reduction in inventory.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-7869940.00'}}\n```",
