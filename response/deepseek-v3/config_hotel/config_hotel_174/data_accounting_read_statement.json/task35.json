Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**: This refers to \"Selling Expenses\" because these are the costs associated with marketing, selling, and delivering products or services to customers.\n   - In the given problem, the \"Selling Expenses\" amount is `9828.84`.\n\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This refers to \"Financial Expenses\" because these are the costs associated with borrowing funds (e.g., interest expenses).\n   - In the given problem, the \"Financial Expenses\" amount is `3193.59`.\n\n3. **The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This refers to \"Depreciation\" because it represents the allocation of the cost of an asset over its useful life.\n   - In the given problem, the \"Depreciation\" amount is `117540.62`.\n\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period**: This refers to \"Tax Expense\" because it represents the total taxes owed or recovered for the period.\n   - In the given problem, the \"Tax Expense\" amount is `39599.66`.\n\nNow, we can fill in the values in the required JSON format, maintaining the order of the line items as they appear in the task description (Selling Expenses, Depreciation, Financial Expenses, Tax Expense).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '9828.84', 'value2': '117540.62', 'value3': '3193.59', 'value4': '39599.66'} }\n```",
