In cash flow statements, this is typically labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" or similar.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - In the provided cash flow statement, we look for a line item that matches the description of tax payable.\n   - The line item found is: \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an amount of \"39599.66\" and the date \"2024-02-03\".\n\n3. **Verify the Context**: \n   - This line item is under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, which is the correct section for such items.\n   - The amount is positive, indicating an increase in tax payable (i.e., tax accrued but not yet paid).\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: \n   - The value corresponding to the increase in tax payable is \"39599.66\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '39599.66'} }\n```",
