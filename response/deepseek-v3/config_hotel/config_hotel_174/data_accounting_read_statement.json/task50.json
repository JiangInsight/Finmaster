                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to identify and extract the four specific line items from the cash flow statement based on the descriptions provided. \n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to find four specific values from the cash flow statement:\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is typically referred to as \"Depreciation\" in the cash flow statement.\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period**: This usually corresponds to \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\".\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends**: This is generally the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Cash Flow Statement\nLet's go through the provided cash flow statement and locate these items.\n\n1. **Depreciation**:\n   - Looking at the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, we see:\n     - `Depreciation  | 117540.62 | 2024-02-03`\n   - So, `value1 = '117540.62'`\n\n2. **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**:\n   - In the same section:\n     - `(Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -7869940.00 | 2024-02-03`\n   - This is the change in inventory, so `value2 = '-7869940.00'`\n\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - Under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\":\n     - `Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -2496137.92 | 2024-02-03`\n   - This represents the net cash from investing activities, so `value3 = '-2496137.92'`\n\n4. **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n   - Under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\":\n     - `Net Increase  | -7000890.60 | 2024-02-03`\n   - This is the net change in cash, so `value4 = '-7000890.60'`\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe order in the solution should match the order in which these items appear in the input statement:\n1. Depreciation\n2. (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\n3. Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n4. Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThis matches the order we've extracted them in.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '117540.62', 'value2': '-7869940.00', 'value3': '-2496137.92', 'value4': '-7000890.60'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. **Depreciation**: Found under operating activities as \"Depreciation\" with amount `117540.62`.\n2. **Inventory Change**: Found as \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with amount `-7869940.00`.\n3. **Investing Activities Net Cash Flow**: Found as \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with amount `-2496137.92`.\n4. **Net Increase in Cash**: Found under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" as \"Net Increase\" with amount `-7000890.60`.\n\nAll values are correctly identified and ordered as per the input statement.",
