This represents the costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services.\n\n2. **Identify the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - In the provided Cash Flow Statement, the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" line item has an amount of `2496137.92`. This represents the cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\n3. **Group the values by financial statement order**:\n   - The task specifies the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Since the required values are from the Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement, we skip the Balance Sheet.\n   - The first value (`value1`) is from the Income Statement (\"Selling Expenses\").\n   - The second value (`value2`) is from the Cash Flow Statement (\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\").\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '9828.84', 'value2': '2496137.92'} }\n```",
