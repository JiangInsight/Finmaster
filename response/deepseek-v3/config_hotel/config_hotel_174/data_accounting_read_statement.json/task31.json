Then, we decompose this item into four component sub-items that are involved in its calculation. \n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Profit Before Tax**: \n   - From the given income statement, the \"Profit Before Tax\" is `151331.49`.\n\n2. **Understand the Calculation of Profit Before Tax**:\n   - Profit Before Tax is typically calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Profit Before Tax} = \\text{Gross Profit} - \\text{Total Expenses} + \\text{Interest Income}\n     \\]\n   - Gross Profit is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Gross Profit} = \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Total Cost}\n     \\]\n   - From the income statement:\n     - Total Revenue = `791992.51`\n     - Total Cost = `504930.00`\n     - Gross Profit = `287062.51`\n     - Total Expenses = `140995.72`\n     - Interest Income = `5264.70`\n\n3. **Decompose Profit Before Tax into 4 Sub-Items**:\n   - The four sub-items involved in the calculation are:\n     1. Total Revenue (`791992.51`)\n     2. Total Cost (`504930.00`)\n     3. Total Expenses (`140995.72`)\n     4. Interest Income (`5264.70`)\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"151331.49\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value1\": \"791992.51\", \"sub_item value2\": \"504930.00\", \"sub_item value3\": \"140995.72\", \"sub_item value4\": \"5264.70\"}}}\n```",
