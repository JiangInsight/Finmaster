This typically refers to \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet, as it represents the money owed to the entity by its customers for goods or services delivered on credit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item that represents amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit is \"Accounts Receivable\".\n\n2. **Locate the Initial and End Values**:\n   - In the given balance sheet, look for the row labeled \"Accounts Receivable\".\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" column shows the value at the beginning of the period (\"Initial value\").\n   - The \"End_amount\" column shows the value at the end of the period (\"End value\").\n\n3. **Extract the Values**:\n   - For \"Accounts Receivable\":\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: 248540.09 (as of 2024-02-03)\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '248540.09'} }\n```",
