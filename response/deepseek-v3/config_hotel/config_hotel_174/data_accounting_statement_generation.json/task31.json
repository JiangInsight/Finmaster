Identify all transactions with type \"Interest Receivables\":\n   - Interest20240101001: 445.0\n   - Interest20240102002: 445.0\n   - Interest20240103003: 445.0\n   - Interest20240104004: 313.28\n   - Interest20240105005: 313.28\n   - Interest20240106006: 245.3552\n   - Interest20240107007: 245.3552\n   - Interest20240108008: 215.18419999999998\n   - Interest20240109009: 215.18419999999998\n   - Interest20240110010: 215.18419999999998\n   - Interest20240111011: 215.18419999999998\n   - Interest20240112012: 215.18419999999998\n   - Interest20240113013: 215.18419999999998\n   - Interest20240114014: 132.50396272999998\n   - Interest20240115015: 132.50396272999998\n   - Interest20240116016: 132.50396272999998\n   - Interest20240117017: 132.50396272999998\n   - Interest20240118018: 132.50396272999998\n   - Interest20240119019: 132.50396272999998\n   - Interest20240120020: 132.50396272999998\n   - Interest20240121021: 132.50396272999998\n   - Interest20240122022: 132.50396272999998\n   - Interest20240123023: 132.50396272999998\n   - Interest20240124024: 132.50396272999998\n   - Interest20240125025: 6.377925119999985\n   - Interest20240126026: 6.377925119999985\n   - Interest20240127027: 6.377925119999985\n   - Interest20240128028: 6.377925119999985\n   - Interest20240129029: 6.377925119999985\n   - Interest20240130030: 6.377925119999985\n   - Interest20240131031: 6.377925119999985\n   - Interest20240201032: 6.377925119999985\n   - Interest20240202033: 6.377925119999985\n   - Interest20240203034: 6.377925119999985\n\n2. Sum all these amounts:\n   - First 3 transactions: 445.0 * 3 = 1335.0\n   - Next 2 transactions: 313.28 * 2 = 626.56\n   - Next 2 transactions: 245.3552 * 2 ≈ 490.7104\n   - Next 9 transactions: 215.18419999999998 * 9 ≈ 1936.6578\n   - Next 13 transactions: 132.50396272999998 * 13 ≈ 1722.5515\n   - Last 12 transactions: 6.377925119999985 * 12 ≈ 76.5351\n\n3. Total sum:\n   1335.0 + 626.56 + 490.7104 + 1936.6578 + 1722.5515 + 76.5351 ≈ 6187.0148\n\n4. Round to 2 decimal places: 6187.01\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the solution was much smaller (2672.87), which suggests that perhaps we should only consider transactions up to January 31, 2024 (like in the example), and not include February transactions. Let's recalculate:\n\n1. Sum only up to January 31:\n   - First 3: 1335.0\n   - Next 2: 626.56\n   - Next 2: 490.7104\n   - Next 9: 1936.6578\n   - Next 13: 1722.5515\n   - January 25-31: 6.377925119999985 * 7 ≈ 44.6455\n   Total: 1335.0 + 626.56 + 490.7104 + 1936.6578 + 1722.5515 + 44.6455 ≈ 6157.1252\n\nThis still doesn't match the example. Maybe we should only consider transactions where the payment status is \"Unpaid\" (like in the example where all interest transactions were unpaid). In this case, all the interest transactions are marked as \"Unpaid\", so this doesn't change anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should only consider transactions where the recorded_date is in January 2024 (excluding the initial December transactions). But all the interest transactions are in January or February.\n\nGiven that we can't exactly match the example's methodology, and since all interest transactions are valid, we'll present the total sum of all interest receivables up to February 3, 2024.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Interest Income': '6187.01'}}\n```",
