The taxes payable are typically derived from the tax amounts recorded in sales transactions. \n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. **Initial Taxes Payable**: \n   - The initial value of taxes payable is assumed to be zero unless there are any initial transactions indicating otherwise. In the given data, there are no initial tax amounts recorded, so the initial value is `0.00`.\n\n2. **Final Taxes Payable**:\n   - We need to sum all the tax amounts (`tax_amount`) from the sales transactions (`type = 'Sale'`) in the dataset. \n   - The tax amounts are recorded in the `tax_amount` column for each sale transaction.\n\n3. **Calculation**:\n   - Extract all rows where `type` is 'Sale'.\n   - Sum the `tax_amount` values from these rows to get the final taxes payable.\n\n### Implementation:\nLet's go through the dataset and sum the `tax_amount` values from all sale transactions.\n\nHere is the calculation:\n\n- Sum of all `tax_amount` values from sale transactions:\n  - The dataset contains multiple sale transactions with varying `tax_amount` values. For example:\n    - Sale20240102002: 76.67\n    - Sale20240102003: 25.84\n    - Sale20240103004: 807.22\n    - Sale20240103005: 150.95\n    - Sale20240103006: 718.56\n    - ... and so on for all sale transactions.\n\nAfter summing all these values, the total taxes payable at the end of the period is `271550.92`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"271550.92\"}}\n```",
