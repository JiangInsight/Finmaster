Liabilities typically include accounts payable and any other unpaid obligations. \n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Liabilities:**\n   - The initial liabilities are the amounts recorded as unpaid at the beginning (2023-12-31).\n   - From the transactions, we look for entries with `payment/receipt_status` as \"Unpaid\" and `date` as \"2023-12-31\".\n   - The relevant transactions are:\n     - `Purchase20231231002`: Amount = 80,500.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231003`: Amount = 342,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231004`: Amount = 130,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231007`: Amount = 137,280.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231012`: Amount = 288,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231015`: Amount = 132,880.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231016`: Amount = 665,280.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231017`: Amount = 230,560.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231020`: Amount = 299,520.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231021`: Amount = 348,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n   - Sum of initial liabilities: \n     \\[\n     80,500 + 342,000 + 130,000 + 137,280 + 288,000 + 132,880 + 665,280 + 230,560 + 299,520 + 348,000 = 2,653,020.0\n     \\]\n\n2. **Identify Final Liabilities:**\n   - The final liabilities include all unpaid amounts at the end of the period (2024-02-03).\n   - We need to consider:\n     - Initial unpaid amounts that remain unpaid.\n     - New unpaid transactions during the period.\n   - From the transactions, the unpaid entries are:\n     - `Purchase20231231002`: 80,500.0\n     - `Purchase20231231003`: 342,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231004`: 130,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231007`: 137,280.0\n     - `Purchase20231231012`: 288,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231015`: 132,880.0\n     - `Purchase20231231016`: 665,280.0\n     - `Purchase20231231017`: 230,560.0\n     - `Purchase20231231020`: 299,520.0\n     - `Purchase20231231021`: 348,000.0\n     - `Sale20240102002`: 1,533.3 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240103005`: 3,018.9 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240104008`: 683.73 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240111034`: 32,593.6 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240112036`: 26,381.4 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240112038`: 10,064.8 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240113040`: 2,638.7 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240114041`: 6,765.8 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240114043`: 3,576.03 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240115046`: 21,327.57 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240117051`: 17,427.44 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240117053`: 8,584.98 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240118054`: 2,528.38 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240118055`: 20,331.64 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240119057`: 4,021.32 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240120060`: 2,244.08 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240120061`: 3,165.33 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240123067`: 2,450.56 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240125075`: 8,402.4 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240126077`: 13,709.55 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240127080`: 6,272.12 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240129086`: 2,834.2 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - `Sale20240131091`: 14,630.35 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n   - Sum of unpaid purchases (initial liabilities): 2,653,020.0\n   - Sum of unpaid sales (new liabilities): \n     \\[\n     1,533.3 + 3,018.9 + 683.73 + 32,593.6 + 26,381.4 + 10,064.8 + 2,638.7 + 6,765.8 + 3,576.03 + 21,327.57 + 17,427.44 + 8,584.98 + 2,528.38 + 20,331.64 + 4,021.32 + 2,244.08 + 3,165.33 + 2,450.56 + 8,402.4 + 13,709.55 + 6,272.12 + 2,834.2 + 14,630.35 = 176,567.53\n     \\]\n   - Total final liabilities: \n     \\[\n     2,653,020.0 (unpaid purchases) + 176,567.53 (unpaid sales) = 2,829,587.53\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Answer:**\n   - Initial Liabilities: 2,653,020.0\n   - Final Liabilities: 2,829,587.53\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"2653020.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"2829587.53\"}}\n```",
