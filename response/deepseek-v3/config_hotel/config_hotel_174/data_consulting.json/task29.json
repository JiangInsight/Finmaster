                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the four requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,389,719.66\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = 3,389,719.66\n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,111,731.83\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 3,389,719.66 / 16,111,731.83 ≈ 0.21\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:** Net Profit Margin = Net Profit / Total Revenue * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 111,731.83\n- Total Revenue = 791,992.51\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (111,731.83 / 791,992.51) * 100 ≈ 14.11%\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:** ROA = Net Profit / Average Total Assets * 100\n\nFirst, calculate Average Total Assets:\n- Initial Total Assets = 16,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets = 19,501,451.49\n- Average Total Assets = (16,000,000 + 19,501,451.49) / 2 = 17,750,725.745\n\nNet Profit = 111,731.83\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (111,731.83 / 17,750,725.745) * 100 ≈ 0.63%\n\n*Wait a minute*, the initial and end dates are from 2023-12-31 to 2024-02-03, which is about a month. Maybe it's more appropriate to use the ending total assets since the net profit is for that period. Let me check the example given.\n\nLooking at the example:\n- They used End_amount for Total Assets = 13,216,409.49\n- Net Profit = -1,645,141.43\n- ROA = -12.55%\nCalculation: (-1,645,141.43 / 13,216,409.49) * 100 ≈ -12.45% (close to -12.55%, maybe rounding)\n\nSo, it seems they used ending total assets, not average. Let's adjust:\n\nROA = Net Profit / Ending Total Assets * 100\n= 111,731.83 / 19,501,451.49 * 100 ≈ 0.57%\n\nHmm, the example's calculation seems slightly off from direct division, maybe due to rounding in the numbers provided. I'll proceed with ending total assets.\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:** Accounts Receivable Turnover = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since no cash sales are mentioned), Net Credit Sales = Total Revenue = 791,992.51\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00\n- End Accounts Receivable = 248,540.09\n- Average = (0 + 248,540.09) / 2 = 124,270.045\n\nCalculation:\nAccounts Receivable Turnover = 791,992.51 / 124,270.045 ≈ 6.37\n\n*But in the example, they seem to have used ending accounts receivable, not average:*\nExample:\n- Total Revenue = 5,431,018.59\n- End Accounts Receivable = 2,429,482.13\n- Turnover = 5,431,018.59 / 2,429,482.13 ≈ 2.24 (but given as 4.47, which is 5,431,018.59 / (2,429,482.13 / 2) ≈ 4.47)\n\nAh, so the example is using (Revenue / (Ending AR / 2)), which is effectively Revenue / Average AR if starting AR is 0.\n\nSo, in our case:\nAverage AR = (0 + 248,540.09) / 2 = 124,270.045\nTurnover = 791,992.51 / 124,270.045 ≈ 6.37\n\nBut to match the example's method:\nTurnover = Revenue / (Ending AR / 2) = 791,992.51 / (248,540.09 / 2) = 791,992.51 / 124,270.045 ≈ 6.37\n\nSame result. Maybe the example had a different interpretation. Given that, I'll stick with 6.37.\n\n### Final Calculations:\n1. Debt to Equity Ratio: ~0.21\n2. Net Profit Margin: ~14.11%\n3. ROA: ~0.57%\n4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: ~6.37\n\nBut looking back at the example's ROA, they might have used a different period or averaging. Given that the time period is short (about a month), using ending assets might be more appropriate, leading to ROA ≈ 0.57%.\n\nSimilarly, for the turnover, using the method that matches the example gives ~6.37.\n\nHowever, the example's turnover seems to be calculated as Revenue / Average AR (with starting AR as 0, so Average AR = End AR / 2), leading to higher turnover. Our calculation is consistent with that.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21', 'Net Profit Margin': '14.11%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '0.57%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '6.37'}}\n```\n\n*Wait, let me double-check the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio in the example:*\nGiven:\nRevenue = 5,431,018.59\nEnd AR = 2,429,482.13\nGiven Turnover = 4.47\nCalculation: 5,431,018.59 / (2,429,482.13 / 2) ≈ 4.47\n\nSo, in our case:\nRevenue = 791,992.51\nEnd AR = 248,540.09\nTurnover = 791,992.51 / (248,540.09 / 2) = 791,992.51 / 124,270.045 ≈ 6.37\n\nYes, that's correct. Maybe the example had a typo, but our calculation follows the same method.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21', 'Net Profit Margin': '14.11%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '0.57%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '6.37'}}\n```",
