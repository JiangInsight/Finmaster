                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate two ratios: the Debt to Asset Ratio and the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount): 3,389,719.66\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3,389,719.66\n- Total Assets (End_amount): 19,501,451.49\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{3,389,719.66}{19,501,451.49} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n3,389,719.66 ÷ 19,501,451.49 ≈ 0.1738\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.17\n\n**Interpretation:**\nThis means that 17% of the company's assets are financed by debt.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operations to the net income, indicating how much cash is generated per dollar of net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -4,504,752.68\n- Net Profit (from Income Statement): 111,731.83\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{-4,504,752.68}{111,731.83} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n-4,504,752.68 ÷ 111,731.83 ≈ -40.32\n\n**Interpretation:**\nA negative ratio indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative while the net income is positive, which could be a red flag suggesting that net income isn't translating into cash, possibly due to significant increases in working capital (like inventory or receivables).\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided in the task, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio was given as a positive number (4.41) despite both the net profit and operating cash flow being negative. This seems inconsistent because dividing two negative numbers should yield a positive result. \n\nIn our case:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -4,504,752.68\n- Net Profit: 111,731.83 (positive)\nSo, the ratio is negative.\n\nBut if we consider the absolute values (which might not be standard), it would be:\n\n| -4,504,752.68 | / 111,731.83 ≈ 40.32\n\nBut the correct mathematical calculation is -40.32.\n\nGiven that the example seems to have taken absolute values or perhaps there's a different interpretation, I'll stick with the mathematically correct value.\n\nBut looking at the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is indeed negative, and Net Profit is positive, leading to a negative ratio.\n\nPerhaps the ratio is supposed to be the absolute value or maybe the signs are considered differently in accounting contexts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is meant to show how many times the operating cash flow covers the net income, and since it's negative, it's indicating that operating cash flow is not covering net income but rather the opposite.\n\nGiven that, and to match the example's format where the ratio was positive despite negative numbers, perhaps we take the absolute value.\n\nSo, absolute value: 40.32\n\nBut the example had:\n\nNet Profit: -1,645,141.43\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,259,994.10\nRatio given: 4.41\n\n-7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41\n\nSo, the ratio is correctly calculated by dividing the two numbers as is, preserving the signs.\n\nIn our case:\n\n-4,504,752.68 / 111,731.83 ≈ -40.32\n\nBut the example shows that when both are negative, the ratio is positive. Here, one is negative, one is positive, so ratio is negative.\n\nPerhaps the ratio is always presented as positive, taking absolute values.\n\nBut mathematically, the correct ratio is -40.32.\n\nGiven that, and since the example had both numbers negative yielding a positive ratio, maybe the ratio is supposed to be the magnitude without the sign.\n\nSo, presenting it as 40.32.\n\nBut to be precise, the ratio is -40.32.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll present the mathematically accurate value.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.17', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-40.32'} }\n```\n\nHowever, considering the example provided where both numbers were negative and the ratio was positive, it's possible that the ratio is intended to be the absolute value or perhaps the ratio is defined differently in this context (like Operating Cash Flow divided by absolute Net Income). \n\nGiven that, and to match the example's approach, perhaps we should take the absolute value of the ratio, making it 40.32.\n\nBut since the example had both numerator and denominator negative, resulting in a positive ratio, and here we have numerator negative and denominator positive, resulting in negative ratio, it's mathematically correct to present it as -40.32.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is always Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Income, regardless of signs, and the magnitude is what's important.\n\nGiven that, and since the example's ratio was positive with both numbers negative, perhaps the ratio is indeed -40.32 here.\n\nBut to align with the example where the ratio was positive despite both numbers being negative, it's possible that the ratio is calculated by dividing the two numbers as is, and the sign is part of the ratio.\n\nSo, in the example:\n\n-7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 = 4.41 (positive)\n\nHere:\n\n-4,504,752.68 / 111,731.83 = -40.32\n\nThus, the correct ratio is -40.32.\n\nBut if the ratio is supposed to indicate how much operating cash flow is generated per unit of net income, and negative operating cash flow with positive net income is bad, the negative sign correctly reflects that.\n\nTherefore, the accurate representation is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.17', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-40.32'} }\n```",
