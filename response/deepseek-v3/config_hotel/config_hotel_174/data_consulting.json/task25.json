                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Equity Ratio, the Net Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's debt relative to its equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities listed):** 3,389,719.66\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 16,111,731.83\n\nAssuming there are no long-term liabilities (since they're not listed), the total liabilities are just the current liabilities.\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{3,389,719.66}{16,111,731.83} \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3,389,719.66}{16,111,731.83} \\approx 0.2104 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately **0.21**.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net profit is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** 111,731.83\n- **Total Revenue:** 791,992.51\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{111,731.83}{791,992.51} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{111,731.83}{791,992.51} \\approx 0.1411 \\]\n\\[ 0.1411 \\times 100\\% \\approx 14.11\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is approximately **14.11%**.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow from its operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -4,504,752.68 (negative value)\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 3,389,719.66\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-4,504,752.68}{3,389,719.66} \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-4,504,752.68}{3,389,719.66} \\approx -1.329 \\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio is approximately **-1.33**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all these calculations into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21', 'Net Profit Margin': '14.11%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.33'}}\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - 3,389,719.66 / 16,111,731.83 ≈ 0.21 ✔\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - 111,731.83 / 791,992.51 ≈ 0.1411 → 14.11% ✔\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities:**\n   - -4,504,752.68 / 3,389,719.66 ≈ -1.33 ✔\n\nAll calculations seem correct based on the provided data. The negative operating cash flow indicates that the company's operations are not generating enough cash to cover current liabilities, which might be a concern, but that's what the numbers show.\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Debt to Equity Ratio (0.21):** This suggests that the company is using less debt compared to its equity, which is generally seen as less risky.\n  \n- **Net Profit Margin (14.11%):** A positive net profit margin indicates profitability, meaning the company is making a profit from its revenues.\n  \n- **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities (-1.33):** The negative value here is a red flag, indicating that operating activities are not generating sufficient cash to cover short-term obligations. This could be due to significant investments in inventory or receivables, as seen in the cash flow statement where inventory increased by 7,869,940.00, which is a large cash outflow.\n\nThese ratios together suggest that while the company is profitable and not heavily leveraged, its operations are currently not generating positive cash flow relative to its current liabilities, possibly due to heavy investment in inventory or other operational expenditures.",
