                        "content": "To calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio, we use the following formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** is taken from the Income Statement.\n- **Average Inventory** is calculated as \\((\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}) / 2\\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Identify Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**\n   - From the Income Statement, COGS = 504,930.00.\n\n2. **Identify Beginning and Ending Inventory:**\n   - From the Balance Sheet:\n     - Beginning Inventory (Initial_amount for Inventory on 2023-12-31) = 0.00.\n     - Ending Inventory (End_amount for Inventory on 2024-02-03) = 7,869,940.00.\n\n3. **Calculate Average Inventory:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2} = \\frac{0.00 + 7,869,940.00}{2} = 3,934,970.00\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Inventory Turnover Ratio:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} = \\frac{504,930.00}{3,934,970.00} \\approx 0.128\n   \\]\n\n   However, this result seems unusually low. Let's verify the calculation:\n   - The ratio is typically higher (e.g., >1) for most businesses, but in this case, the COGS is relatively small compared to the average inventory. This could indicate slow-moving inventory or a seasonal business.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   The Inventory Turnover Ratio is approximately 0.13.\n\n### Final JSON:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.13'}}\n```\n\n### Note:\nIf the Beginning Inventory was not zero (e.g., if there was a typo in the data), the ratio would be higher. For example, if the Beginning Inventory was 7,869,940.00 (same as Ending Inventory), the average would be 7,869,940.00, and the ratio would be:\n\\[\n\\frac{504,930.00}{7,869,940.00} \\approx 0.064\n\\]\nBut based on the given data (Beginning Inventory = 0.00), the correct ratio is 0.13.",
