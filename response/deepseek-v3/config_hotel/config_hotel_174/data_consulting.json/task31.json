                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand where each number comes from.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:** Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Credit Sales (Main Business Revenue):** 791,992.51\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Ending Accounts Receivable:** 248,540.09\n- **Initial Accounts Receivable:** 0.00 (since it was 0 at the start)\n\n**Average Accounts Receivable:** (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2 = (0 + 248,540.09) / 2 = 124,270.045\n\n**Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:** 791,992.51 / 124,270.045 ≈ 6.37\n\n*Wait a minute, in the example, the ratio was calculated differently. Maybe they used only ending AR instead of average. Let me check.*\n\nIf we use only ending AR:\n791,992.51 / 248,540.09 ≈ 3.19\n\nBut the example used average, so I think 6.37 is correct. Maybe the example had a typo.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -4,504,752.68\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 3,389,719.66\n\n**Operating Cash Flow Ratio:** -4,504,752.68 / 3,389,719.66 ≈ -1.33\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis seems the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. Maybe it's a duplicate in the example. So, same as above: -1.33\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:** Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Sales (Total Revenue):** 791,992.51\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Ending Total Assets:** 19,501,451.49\n- **Initial Total Assets:** 16,000,000.00\n\n**Average Total Assets:** (16,000,000 + 19,501,451.49) / 2 = 17,750,725.745\n\n**Total Asset Turnover Ratio:** 791,992.51 / 17,750,725.745 ≈ 0.0446\n\nHmm, this seems very low. Maybe I should use only ending total assets.\n\nIf using only ending total assets:\n791,992.51 / 19,501,451.49 ≈ 0.0406\n\nStill low. Maybe the revenue is for a short period, but the example had a higher ratio. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the example had Total Asset Turnover as 0.41, which is higher. Maybe the revenue is annualized? But the dates are similar (one month vs. one month and a few days). Maybe the revenue is just lower in this case.\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 3,389,719.66 (no long-term liabilities mentioned, so this is total liabilities)\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 16,111,731.83\n\n**Debt to Equity Ratio:** 3,389,719.66 / 16,111,731.83 ≈ 0.21\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter calculating all the ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '6.37', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-1.33', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.33', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.04', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21'} }\n```\n\n*Wait, the Total Asset Turnover seems too low compared to the example. Maybe I should use only ending assets without averaging.*\n\nRecalculating Total Asset Turnover with ending assets only:\n791,992.51 / 19,501,451.49 ≈ 0.04\n\nStill the same. Maybe the revenue is indeed low for the asset base in this case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the revenue is supposed to be annualized, but since the example didn't do that, I'll stick with the direct calculation.\n\n### Rechecking Accounts Receivable Turnover\nMaybe the ratio is supposed to be based on ending AR only:\n791,992.51 / 248,540.09 ≈ 3.19\n\nGiven that the example used average, but the initial AR was 0, which might skew it, perhaps using ending is better here.\n\nUpdating:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.19', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-1.33', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.33', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.04', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21'} }\n```\n\nAfter reconsidering, the most plausible ratios are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.19', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-1.33', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.33', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.04', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21'} }\n```",
