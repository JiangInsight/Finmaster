                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Gross Profit Margin and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n\n### 1. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:**\nGross Profit Margin is a profitability ratio that shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n**From the Income Statement:**\n- Total Revenue = 791,992.51\n- Gross Profit = 287,062.51\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{287,062.51}{791,992.51} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{287,062.51}{791,992.51} \\approx 0.3624 \\]\n\\[ 0.3624 \\times 100 \\approx 36.24\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **36.24%**.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow generated from a company's operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,504,752.68 (negative value)\n  \n**From the Balance Sheet (End Period):**\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,389,719.66\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-4,504,752.68}{3,389,719.66} \\]\n\nLet's compute this:\n\\[ \\frac{-4,504,752.68}{3,389,719.66} \\approx -1.329 \\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately **-1.33**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining both calculations:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '36.24%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.33'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Gross Profit Margin:**\n- Gross Profit = 287,062.51\n- Total Revenue = 791,992.51\n- 287,062.51 / 791,992.51 ≈ 0.3624 → 36.24% ✔\n\n**Operating Cash Flow Ratio:**\n- Net Operating Cash Flow = -4,504,752.68\n- Current Liabilities = 3,389,719.66\n- -4,504,752.68 / 3,389,719.66 ≈ -1.329 → -1.33 ✔\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin (36.24%):** This is relatively high, indicating that the company retains a good portion of revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold. It suggests strong pricing power or efficient cost management in production.\n  \n- **Operating Cash Flow Ratio (-1.33):** A negative ratio is concerning. It means that the company's operating activities are not generating enough cash to cover current liabilities; in fact, it's burning cash. This could be due to significant increases in working capital (like inventory or receivables) or other operational inefficiencies. \n\nIn the given data:\n- There's a large increase in inventory (-7,869,940.00), which is a significant use of cash.\n- Accounts payable increased (3,350,120.00), which is a source of cash, but not enough to offset the inventory increase.\n  \nThis negative cash flow from operations is a red flag that needs attention, despite the positive net profit. The company might be profitable on paper but is struggling with cash management, possibly due to rapid growth or inventory buildup.",
