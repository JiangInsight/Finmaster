                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nFirst, what is the Debt to Equity Ratio? It's a financial ratio that compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholders' equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\nThis ratio gives an idea of how much debt a company is using to finance its assets relative to the value of shareholders' equity.\n\n### Identifying the Components from the Balance Sheet\n\nFrom the given balance sheet, we need to identify:\n\n1. **Total Liabilities**: This is the sum of all the company's debts or obligations. In the balance sheet, it's usually listed under \"Total Current Liabilities\" if there are no long-term liabilities mentioned.\n   \n   - In the problem, under \"Total Current Liabilities\", the \"End_amount\" is `3,389,719.66`. There's no mention of long-term liabilities, so we can assume that's the total liabilities.\n\n2. **Total Shareholders' Equity**: This is the owners' claim after all liabilities have been paid off. It's listed as \"Total Owner's Equity\" in the balance sheet.\n   \n   - Here, \"Total Owner's Equity\" has an \"End_amount\" of `16,111,731.83`.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{3,389,719.66}{16,111,731.83} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3,389,719.66}{16,111,731.83} \\approx 0.2104 \\]\n\n### Rounding the Result\n\nTypically, financial ratios are presented with two decimal places. So, rounding 0.2104 to two decimal places gives us 0.21.\n\n### Verifying the Numbers\n\nJust to ensure I didn't miss anything:\n\n- **Total Liabilities**: Only \"Total Current Liabilities\" is given as `3,389,719.66`. No other liabilities are listed, so this seems correct.\n  \n- **Total Equity**: \"Total Owner's Equity\" is clearly `16,111,731.83`.\n\nNo other debts or equity items seem to be missing, so the calculation appears accurate.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21'} }\n```",
