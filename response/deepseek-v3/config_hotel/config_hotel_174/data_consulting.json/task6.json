                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Net Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Net Profit Margin\nFirst, I recall that the Net Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows what percentage of a company's revenue is actual profit after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted. The formula for Net Profit Margin is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nThis will give us a percentage that represents how much of each dollar earned by the company is profit.\n\n### Identifying the Given Values\nFrom the provided income statement, I can see:\n\n- **Total Revenue**: 791,992.51\n- **Net Profit**: 111,731.83\n\nThese are the two key numbers I need to calculate the Net Profit Margin.\n\n### Calculating the Net Profit Margin\nNow, let's plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{111,731.83}{791,992.51} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide the Net Profit by the Total Revenue:\n\n\\[ \\frac{111,731.83}{791,992.51} \\approx 0.141077 \\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.141077 \\times 100 \\approx 14.1077\\% \\]\n\n### Rounding the Result\nThe example provided had the Net Profit Margin rounded to two decimal places. Following that, I'll round 14.1077% to two decimal places:\n\n\\[ 14.1077\\% \\approx 14.11\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nJust to ensure I didn't make a mistake, let's quickly verify:\n\n- 791,992.51 * 14.1077% ≈ 791,992.51 * 0.141077 ≈ 111,731.83\n\nThis matches the given Net Profit, so the calculation seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter performing the calculations and verifying, the Net Profit Margin is approximately 14.11%.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '14.11%'} }\n```",
