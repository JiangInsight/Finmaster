These typically include:\n   - Cash on Hand\n   - Bank Deposits\n   - Interest Receivable\n   - Accounts Receivable\n   - (Note: Inventory is excluded because it is not as liquid as the other current assets.)\n\n2. **Identify Current Liabilities**: These are liabilities that are due within one year. In this case, it is the \"Total Current Liabilities.\"\n\n3. **Calculate Quick Ratio**: The formula for the Quick Ratio is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Quick Assets**:\n   - Cash on Hand: 927,447.32\n   - Bank Deposits: 71,662.08\n   - Interest Receivable: 5,264.70\n   - Accounts Receivable: 248,540.09\n   - Total Quick Assets = 927,447.32 + 71,662.08 + 5,264.70 + 248,540.09 = 1,252,914.19\n\n2. **Current Liabilities**: 3,389,719.66\n\n3. **Quick Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{1,252,914.19}{3,389,719.66} \\approx 0.37\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '0.37'} }\n```",
