                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Current Ratio and the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: This measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its current assets. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: This shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n\n- **Total Current Assets (End_date: 2024-02-03)**: 9,122,854.19\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_date: 2024-02-03)**: 3,389,719.66\n- **Inventory (Initial_amount)**: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- **Inventory (End_amount)**: 7,869,940.00 (as of 2024-02-03)\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 504,930.00\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{9,122,854.19}{3,389,719.66}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9,122,854.19}{3,389,719.66} \\approx 2.69\n\\]\n\nSo, the Current Ratio is approximately **2.69**.\n\n### Calculating the Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\nFirst, find the Average Inventory:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2} = \\frac{0.00 + 7,869,940.00}{2} = \\frac{7,869,940.00}{2} = 3,934,970.00\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} = \\frac{504,930.00}{3,934,970.00}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{504,930.00}{3,934,970.00} \\approx 0.128\n\\]\n\nSo, the Inventory Turnover Ratio is approximately **0.13**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nWait a minute, the Inventory Turnover Ratio seems quite low (0.13). This would imply that the inventory is turning over less than once during the period, which might not make sense unless the period is very short or sales are very low compared to inventory.\n\nGiven that the COGS is 504,930 and the average inventory is about 3.9 million, it does suggest that only a small portion of the inventory was sold during this period. Given that the time frame is from 2023-12-31 to 2024-02-03, which is about a month, this might be plausible if the business doesn't sell its inventory quickly within that month.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the beginning inventory isn't zero. But according to the balance sheet, the initial amount for inventory is indeed 0.00, and the end amount is 7,869,940.00. Maybe the company started with no inventory and built it up to nearly 8 million within a month, selling only a small portion.\n\nGiven that, the calculation seems correct based on the provided data.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '2.69', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.13'} }\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided in the task, the Inventory Turnover Ratio was calculated as '1.73' where COGS was 4,410,000 and average inventory was (0 + 5,090,000)/2 = 2,545,000, giving 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 â‰ˆ 1.73. \n\nIn our case, COGS is much lower relative to average inventory, leading to a lower ratio. Unless there's a mistake in interpreting the data.\n\nWait, is the \"Initial_amount\" for inventory truly zero at the start? Or is it missing? The balance sheet shows Inventory with Initial_amount as 0.00 and End_amount as 7,869,940.00. \n\nIf initial inventory was indeed zero, then the calculation is correct. But if initial inventory was not zero and perhaps not provided, then we might have an issue. \n\nGiven that the balance sheet shows initial amounts for other items like Cash on Hand as 3,000,000, it's likely that inventory was truly zero at the start. \n\nTherefore, the Inventory Turnover Ratio is correctly calculated as 0.13 based on the given data. \n\nPerhaps the business just started and had no inventory at the beginning, then purchased a lot but sold only a small amount in the first month, leading to a low turnover ratio.\n\nThus, the final answer remains:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '2.69', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.13'} }\n```",
