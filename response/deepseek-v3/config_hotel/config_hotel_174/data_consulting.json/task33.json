                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio one by one using the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,504,752.68\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,389,719.66\n\nCalculation:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -4,504,752.68 / 3,389,719.66 ≈ -1.33\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFirst, we need to determine Total Debt. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are:\n- Accounts Payable = 3,350,120.00\n- Taxes Payable = 39,599.66\nTotal Current Liabilities = 3,389,719.66 (which seems to be the total debt in this case since there are no long-term liabilities listed)\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -4,504,752.68 / 3,389,719.66 ≈ -1.33\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:** Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 504,930.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Ending Inventory = 7,869,940.00\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00 (from the initial amounts)\n\nAverage Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2 = (0 + 7,869,940) / 2 = 3,934,970.00\n\nCalculation:\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 504,930.00 / 3,934,970.00 ≈ 0.13\n\nWait a minute, this seems quite low. Let me double-check the initial inventory. The initial balance sheet shows Inventory initial amount as 0.00, and end amount as 7,869,940.00. So the average is indeed ~3.93 million, and COGS is ~504k, leading to ~0.13 turns. That seems unusually low, but based on the data, that's the calculation.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Debt / Total Equity\n\nTotal Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 3,389,719.66\nTotal Equity = Total Owner's Equity (end amount) = 16,111,731.83\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 3,389,719.66 / 16,111,731.83 ≈ 0.21\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:** (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 9,122,854.19\n- Inventory = 7,869,940.00\n- Current Liabilities = 3,389,719.66\n\nQuick Assets = 9,122,854.19 - 7,869,940.00 = 1,252,914.19\n\nCalculation:\nQuick Ratio = 1,252,914.19 / 3,389,719.66 ≈ 0.37\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nCurrent Assets = 9,122,854.19\nCurrent Liabilities = 3,389,719.66\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 9,122,854.19 / 3,389,719.66 ≈ 2.69\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.33', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.33', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.13', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21', 'Quick Ratio': '0.37', 'Current Ratio': '2.69'}}\n```\n\n**Reviewing the Inventory Turnover Ratio:**\nGiven that the initial inventory was 0 and the ending is 7,869,940, and COGS is 504,930, the average inventory is ~3.93 million, leading to a ratio of ~0.13. This implies that only about 13% of the average inventory was sold during the period, which might suggest that most of the inventory was acquired towards the end of the period, hence not much was sold yet. This seems plausible given the data.\n\nAll other ratios seem correctly calculated based on the provided financial statements. The negative operating cash flow and cash flow to debt ratios indicate that the company's operating activities are consuming cash rather than generating it, which aligns with the negative net cash flow from operations. The quick ratio is below 1, suggesting that without inventory, the company might struggle to cover its short-term liabilities, but the current ratio is healthy at ~2.69, indicating overall good short-term financial health when inventory is considered. The debt to equity ratio is low (0.21), showing that the company is not heavily leveraged.",
