                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each ratio one by one using the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 9,122,854.19\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 3,389,719.66\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 9,122,854.19 / 3,389,719.66 ≈ 2.69\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 927,447.32\n- Bank Deposits = 71,662.08 (assuming these are cash equivalents)\n- Interest Receivable = 5,264.70 (usually considered quick assets)\n- Accounts Receivable = 248,540.09\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,389,719.66\n\nQuick Assets = 927,447.32 + 71,662.08 + 5,264.70 + 248,540.09 = 1,252,914.19\n\nQuick Ratio = 1,252,914.19 / 3,389,719.66 ≈ 0.37\n\n*Wait a minute*, the quick ratio seems quite low compared to the current ratio. Maybe I should exclude interest receivable since it's not always considered a quick asset. Let's try without it:\n\nQuick Assets = 927,447.32 + 71,662.08 + 248,540.09 = 1,247,649.49\nQuick Ratio = 1,247,649.49 / 3,389,719.66 ≈ 0.37\n\nStill the same. Maybe interest receivable is included in accounts receivable? Or perhaps it's negligible. I think the initial calculation stands.\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since there are no non-current liabilities listed) = 3,389,719.66\n- Total Assets = 19,501,451.49\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 3,389,719.66 / 19,501,451.49 ≈ 0.17\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 3,389,719.66\n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,111,731.83\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 3,389,719.66 / 16,111,731.83 ≈ 0.21\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,504,752.68\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 3,389,719.66\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -4,504,752.68 / 3,389,719.66 ≈ -1.33\n\n*Wait*, this seems quite negative. Is operating cash flow really negative? Yes, it is. So the ratio is negative, indicating that operating cash flow is not sufficient to cover debt.\n\n### Verifying Calculations\nLet me double-check the components:\n\n- **Current Ratio:** 9,122,854.19 / 3,389,719.66 = 2.69 (correct)\n- **Quick Ratio:** (927,447.32 + 71,662.08 + 248,540.09) / 3,389,719.66 = 1,247,649.49 / 3,389,719.66 ≈ 0.37 (correct)\n- **Debt to Asset:** 3,389,719.66 / 19,501,451.49 ≈ 0.17 (correct)\n- **Debt to Equity:** 3,389,719.66 / 16,111,731.83 ≈ 0.21 (correct)\n- **Cash Flow to Debt:** -4,504,752.68 / 3,389,719.66 ≈ -1.33 (correct)\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '2.69', 'Quick Ratio': '0.37', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.17', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.33'}}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Differences from Example\nIn the example provided, the quick ratio was higher because current assets included more liquid items relative to current liabilities. Here, a large portion of current assets is inventory (7,869,940.00), which isn't included in the quick ratio, making it much lower. Similarly, the cash flow to debt ratio is negative here because operating cash flow is negative, whereas in the example it was also negative but with a different magnitude relative to debt.\n\nThis seems correct based on the given data.",
