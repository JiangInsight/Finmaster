                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio one by one to understand how to compute them based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures how much cash flow is generated from operating activities relative to the net income. It indicates the quality of earnings, showing whether the company is generating sufficient cash from its operations compared to its reported profits.\n\n**Formula**:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,504,752.68\n- Net Profit = 111,731.83\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{-4,504,752.68}{111,731.83} \\approx -40.32 \\]\n\nWait a minute, this gives a negative ratio, which seems unusual because typically, we'd expect a positive ratio indicating that operating cash flow is covering net income. Here, both the numerator and denominator are present, but the operating cash flow is negative while net income is positive, which is unusual. Maybe I should double-check the numbers.\n\nLooking back:\n- Net Profit is indeed positive: 111,731.83\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is negative: -4,504,752.68\n\nThis suggests that despite reporting a net profit, the company had a significant cash outflow from operations, possibly due to increases in working capital (like inventory and receivables). \n\nBut in the example provided, the ratio was positive even though net profit was negative, so perhaps the absolute value is considered or the formula is numerator over denominator regardless of signs. \n\nGiven that, the ratio is -40.32, but since ratios are often presented as positive, maybe we take the absolute value. Alternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation.\n\nWait, in the example:\nNet Profit: -1,645,141.43\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,259,994.10\nRatio: 4.41\n\nCalculation: -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41\n\nAh, so when both are negative, the negatives cancel out, giving a positive ratio. In our case, one is negative, one is positive, so the ratio is negative. \n\nGiven that, the correct ratio is -40.32. But since the example shows a positive ratio when both are negative, perhaps the formula is absolute value or the sign doesn't matter in interpretation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is:\n\nOperating Cash Flow / Net Income, keeping the sign.\n\nSo, -4,504,752.68 / 111,731.83 ≈ -40.32\n\nBut the example has -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 = 4.41\n\nSo, the ratio can be negative or positive based on the signs.\n\nThus, our answer is -40.32.\n\nBut looking at the example's solution, it's presented as a positive number, so maybe it's the absolute value. \n\nGiven that, perhaps it's |Operating Cash Flow| / |Net Income|.\n\nFor the example: | -7,259,994.10 | / | -1,645,141.43 | = 7,259,994.10 / 1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41\n\nFor our case: | -4,504,752.68 | / | 111,731.83 | = 4,504,752.68 / 111,731.83 ≈ 40.32\n\nSo, the absolute value gives 40.32.\n\nThis seems more consistent with the example's presentation.\n\nTherefore, Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = 40.32\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales revenue.\n\n**Formula**:\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Current Assets} + \\text{Ending Current Assets}}{2} \\]\n\nFrom the data:\n- Total Revenue (from income statement) = 791,992.51\n- Beginning Current Assets (from balance sheet, Initial_amount for Total Current Assets) = 8,000,000.00\n- Ending Current Assets (from balance sheet, End_amount for Total Current Assets) = 9,122,854.19\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{8,000,000.00 + 9,122,854.19}{2} = \\frac{17,122,854.19}{2} = 8,561,427.095 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{791,992.51}{8,561,427.095} \\approx 0.0925 \\]\n\nHmm, this seems quite low compared to the example's ratio of 0.68. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the example:\nTotal Revenue: 5,431,018.59\nBeginning Current Assets: 8,000,000.00\nEnding Current Assets: 7,956,806.47\nAverage: (8,000,000 + 7,956,806.47)/2 ≈ 7,978,403.235\nRatio: 5,431,018.59 / 7,978,403.235 ≈ 0.68\n\nSo, my calculation seems correct based on the formula. Maybe the current problem has a lower turnover due to higher current assets relative to revenue.\n\nThus, Current Assets Turnover Ratio ≈ 0.093\n\nBut the example is given to two decimal places, so 0.09.\n\n### 3. Quick Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets (excluding inventory).\n\n**Formula**:\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = \\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents} + \\text{Marketable Securities} + \\text{Accounts Receivable} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash and Cash Equivalents: This is typically Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits\n  - Cash on Hand (End_amount): 927,447.32\n  - Bank Deposits (End_amount): 71,662.08\n  - Total Cash and Equivalents: 927,447.32 + 71,662.08 = 999,109.40\n- Accounts Receivable (End_amount): 248,540.09\n- Interest Receivable (End_amount): 5,264.70 (usually considered a quick asset)\n  \nSo, Quick Assets = Cash and Equivalents + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable\n= 999,109.40 + 248,540.09 + 5,264.70 = 1,252,914.19\n\nCurrent Liabilities (from balance sheet, End_amount for Total Current Liabilities): 3,389,719.66\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{1,252,914.19}{3,389,719.66} \\approx 0.37 \\]\n\nWait, the example had a quick ratio of 1.54, which is higher. Maybe I'm missing some quick assets.\n\nLooking at the example's quick ratio calculation:\nQuick Assets likely included Cash on Hand (270,005.90), Bank Deposits (164,645.57), Interest Receivable (2,672.87), Accounts Receivable (2,429,482.13)\nTotal: 270,005.90 + 164,645.57 + 2,672.87 + 2,429,482.13 ≈ 2,866,806.47\nCurrent Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\nQuick Ratio: 2,866,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54\n\nSimilarly, in our case, quick assets are cash, bank deposits, interest receivable, and accounts receivable:\n999,109.40 (cash and equivalents) + 248,540.09 (AR) + 5,264.70 (interest receivable) = 1,252,914.19\nCurrent Liabilities: 3,389,719.66\nQuick Ratio: 1,252,914.19 / 3,389,719.66 ≈ 0.37\n\nThis seems correct based on the formula. The quick ratio is lower because a large portion of current assets is inventory (7,869,940.00), which is excluded from quick assets.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter calculating all three ratios:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: | -4,504,752.68 | / | 111,731.83 | ≈ 40.32\n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio: 791,992.51 / 8,561,427.095 ≈ 0.09\n3. Quick Ratio: 1,252,914.19 / 3,389,719.66 ≈ 0.37\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the ratios were presented with two decimal places, so we'll round accordingly.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '40.32', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.09', 'Quick Ratio': '0.37'} }\n```\n\nWait a minute, the quick ratio seems quite low compared to the example's 1.54. Maybe I should recheck what's included in quick assets.\n\nIs inventory the only exclusion? Yes, quick assets exclude inventory and prepaid expenses. Here, we have:\n\nCurrent Assets: 9,122,854.19\nInventory: 7,869,940.00\nSo, quick assets = Total Current Assets - Inventory = 9,122,854.19 - 7,869,940.00 = 1,252,914.19\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. So, the quick ratio is indeed 0.37.\n\nSimilarly, the turnover ratio is correctly calculated as 0.09.\n\nThe operating cash flow to net income ratio is correctly calculated as 40.32 (absolute value).\n\nThus, the final answer is correct as above. \n\nHowever, the quick ratio seems unusually low, but based on the numbers, it's accurate. Maybe the company has a lot of inventory relative to its liquid assets.\n\nFinal JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '40.32', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.09', 'Quick Ratio': '0.37'} }\n```",
