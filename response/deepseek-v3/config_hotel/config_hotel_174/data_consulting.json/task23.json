                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial task step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio.\n\n### 1. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:**  \nGross Profit Margin is a measure of a company's financial health and efficiency in producing its goods or services. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit** = 287,062.51\n- **Total Revenue** = 791,992.51\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{287,062.51}{791,992.51} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{287,062.51}{791,992.51} \\approx 0.3624 \\]\n\\[ 0.3624 \\times 100 \\approx 36.24\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **36.24%**.\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n**Definition:**  \nThis ratio measures a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to identify:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: From the cash flow statement, it's -4,504,752.68.\n- **Total Debt**: From the balance sheet, under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" it's 3,389,719.66 (since there are no non-current liabilities listed, we'll assume this is the total debt).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-4,504,752.68}{3,389,719.66} \\]\n\nLet's compute this:\n\\[ \\frac{-4,504,752.68}{3,389,719.66} \\approx -1.329 \\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-1.33**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nBefore finalizing, let's double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Gross Profit Margin:**\n- Gross Profit / Total Revenue = 287,062.51 / 791,992.51 ≈ 0.3624 → 36.24% ✔\n\n**Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:**\n- Net Operating Cash Flow = -4,504,752.68\n- Total Debt (Current Liabilities) = 3,389,719.66\n- Ratio = -4,504,752.68 / 3,389,719.66 ≈ -1.329 ✔\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '36.24%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.33'} }\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin Interpretation:** A 36.24% margin indicates that for every dollar of revenue, the company retains $0.3624 after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This is a healthy margin, suggesting good control over production costs relative to sales.\n  \n- **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio Interpretation:** A negative ratio (-1.33) means the company's operating cash flow is negative, and it's not generating enough cash from operations to cover its debt. This could be a red flag regarding the company's financial health unless it's a temporary situation (e.g., due to heavy investments or seasonal factors).\n\n- **Assumptions:** \n  - For the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio, I considered only \"Total Current Liabilities\" as the total debt since no long-term liabilities are provided. If there were long-term debts, they should be included in the total debt figure.\n  - The negative cash flow from operations is significant, and in a real-world scenario, it would be important to understand why (e.g., large inventory purchases, delayed receivables).\n\nThis completes the task as per the given financial statements.",
