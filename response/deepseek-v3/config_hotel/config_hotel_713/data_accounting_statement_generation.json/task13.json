The taxes payable are typically derived from the tax amounts collected from sales transactions. \n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. **Initial Taxes Payable Value**: \n   - The initial value of taxes payable is typically zero unless there are any initial tax liabilities. From the given data, there are no initial tax amounts recorded, so the initial value is `0.00`.\n\n2. **Final Taxes Payable Value**:\n   - The final value of taxes payable is the sum of all tax amounts (`tax_amount`) from all sales transactions (`type = 'Sale'`) in the dataset. \n   - We will sum all the `tax_amount` values from the sales transactions to get the final taxes payable.\n\n### Calculation:\n1. **Initial Taxes Payable Value**: `0.00`\n2. **Final Taxes Payable Value**:\n   - Sum all `tax_amount` values from sales transactions. Here is the calculation:\n     - From the sales transactions, we can see the `tax_amount` values (e.g., 69.87, 120.4, 346.14, etc.). \n     - Summing all these values gives the total taxes payable at the end of the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter summing all the `tax_amount` values from the sales transactions, the final taxes payable value is `26274.14`.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Taxes Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Taxes Payable End Value\": \"26274.14\"}}\n```",
