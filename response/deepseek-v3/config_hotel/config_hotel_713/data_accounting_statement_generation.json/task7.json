This is typically recorded at the beginning of the period (2023-12-31).\n   - In the given data, the initial fixed assets entry is:\n     ```\n     | Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 8000000.0 | 8000000.0 | ...\n     ```\n     - The initial fixed assets value is **8,000,000.00**.\n\n2. **Identify Fixed Assets Purchases**:\n   - Look for any transactions where fixed assets are purchased during the period. These would typically be labeled as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar.\n   - In the given data, there are no additional fixed assets purchases recorded after the initial entry. \n\n3. **Calculate Depreciation**:\n   - Depreciation reduces the value of fixed assets over time. Look for depreciation entries in the transactions.\n   - The depreciation entries in the data are:\n     ```\n     | Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45746.47 | 45746.47 | ...\n     | Depreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | 2024-02-01 | 2024-02-01 | 45741.88 | 45741.88 | ...\n     ```\n     - Total depreciation for the period = 45,746.47 + 45,741.88 = **91,488.35**.\n\n4. **Calculate Final Fixed Assets Value**:\n   - The final fixed assets value is calculated as:\n     ```\n     Final Fixed Assets = Initial Fixed Assets - Total Depreciation\n     Final Fixed Assets = 8,000,000.00 - 91,488.35 = 7,908,511.65\n     ```\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Fixed Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Fixed Assets End Value': '7908511.65'} }\n```",
