This appears to be the initial fixed assets entry. \n\nHowever, in the examples provided, the solution was derived from a transaction with the type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" under the id \"FixedAsset20231231001\". In the current problem, there is no transaction with the type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\". \n\nGiven that, the only relevant transaction for fixed assets is the \"Fixed Assets\" entry under \"Initial20231231001\" with an amount of 8,000,000.0. \n\nTherefore, the final purchase of fixed assets is 8,000,000.0.\n\nHere is the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '8000000.0'} }\n```",
