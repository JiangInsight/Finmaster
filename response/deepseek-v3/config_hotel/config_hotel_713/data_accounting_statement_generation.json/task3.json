                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this inventory calculation step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand how much inventory we started with and how much we have at the end based on the transactions provided.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nWe have a list of transactions that include purchases and sales of various products. Our goal is to calculate:\n\n1. **Inventory Initial Value**: The total value of inventory at the beginning (before any transactions).\n2. **Inventory End Value**: The total value of inventory at the end (after all purchases and sales).\n\nFrom the example provided, it seems that the initial inventory value is zero, and the end value is calculated based on purchases minus the cost of goods sold (COGS) from sales.\n\n### Identifying Relevant Transactions\n\nFirst, let's identify which transactions affect the inventory:\n\n1. **Purchase Transactions**: These increase our inventory. They have a \"type\" of \"Purchase\" and include details like product_id, quantity, and cost_per_unit.\n2. **Sale Transactions**: These decrease our inventory. They have a \"type\" of \"Sale\" and include product_id, quantity, and cost_per_unit (which is the cost at which we bought the item, not the selling price).\n\nOther transactions like expenses, deposits, etc., don't affect inventory directly, so we can ignore them for this calculation.\n\n### Calculating Initial Inventory Value\n\nFrom the example, the initial inventory value was \"0.00\". This makes sense because unless there are initial inventory entries, we start with zero. In the given problem, there are no initial inventory entries (like \"Initial20231231001\" for inventory), so:\n\n**Inventory Initial Value = 0.00**\n\n### Calculating Purchases\n\nNow, let's sum up all the purchases to find out how much inventory we've added.\n\nLooking at the transactions, all purchases are dated \"2023-12-31\". Here they are:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001:\n   - product_id: F002 (Business Meal Set)\n   - quantity: 206\n   - cost_per_unit: 350.0\n   - Total: 206 * 350 = 72,100.0\n\n2.

Purchase20231231003:\n   - product_id: F003 (Deluxe Meal Set)\n   - quantity: 195\n   - cost_per_unit: 880.0\n   - Total: 195 * 880 = 171,600.0\n\n4.
