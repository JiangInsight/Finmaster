These are the entries marked as \"Cash deposit\" and \"Bank deposit\" under the \"type\" column in the initial transactions.\n\nFrom the problem data:\n1. There is an initial \"Cash deposit\" of 3,000,000.0.\n2. There is an initial \"Bank deposit\" of 5,000,000.0.\n\nThe beginning balance is the sum of these two amounts:\n3,000,000.0 (Cash deposit) + 5,000,000.0 (Bank deposit) = 8,000,000.0.\n\nThe \"Fixed Assets\" entry is not part of cash and cash equivalents, so it is not included in this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final beginning cash and cash equivalents balance is 8,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
