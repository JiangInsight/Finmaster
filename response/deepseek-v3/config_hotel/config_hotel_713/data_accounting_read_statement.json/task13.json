These are typically the non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets and accumulated depreciation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Balance Sheet Structure**:\n   - The balance sheet is divided into current assets and non-current assets.\n   - Current assets are expected to be realized or consumed within the normal operating cycle (e.g., cash, accounts receivable, inventory).\n   - Non-current assets are not expected to be realized or consumed within the normal operating cycle (e.g., fixed assets, accumulated depreciation).\n\n2. **Identify Non-Current Assets**:\n   - In the given problem, the non-current assets are:\n     - Fixed Assets: Initial amount = 8000000.00, End amount = 8000000.00\n     - Accumulated Depreciation: Initial amount = 0.00, End amount = 91488.35\n   - The \"Total Non-current Assets\" line summarizes these values:\n     - Initial amount = 8000000.00\n     - End amount = 7908511.65 (which is Fixed Assets - Accumulated Depreciation: 8000000.00 - 91488.35 = 7908511.65)\n\n3. **Extract the Required Values**:\n   - The initial value of non-current assets is \"8000000.00\".\n   - The end value of non-current assets is \"7908511.65\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '7908511.65'} }\n```",
