This information is typically found under \"Retained Earnings\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Line Item**: Look for the \"Retained Earnings\" row in the balance sheet. This line item represents the cumulative profits or losses retained in the entity.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**: The \"Initial_amount\" column under \"Retained Earnings\" shows the starting value of retained earnings at the \"Initial_date\". In this case:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - Initial_date: 2023-12-31\n\n3. **Extract End Value**: The \"End_amount\" column under \"Retained Earnings\" shows the ending value of retained earnings at the \"End_date\". In this case:\n   - End_amount: 56497.85\n   - End_date: 2024-02-05\n\n4. **Verify**: Ensure that the values are correctly extracted from the \"Retained Earnings\" line and not from other line items like \"Paid-in Capital\" or \"Total Owner's Equity\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '56497.85'} }\n```",
