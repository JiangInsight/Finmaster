A negative value indicates an increase in inventory (which is a use of cash), and a positive value indicates a decrease in inventory (which is a source of cash). \n\nLooking at the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" has a value of \"-7848830.00\". This indicates an increase in inventory, which is a reduction in cash flow. \n\nTherefore, the value to be extracted is \"-7848830.00\".\n\nHere is the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-7848830.00'}}\n```",
