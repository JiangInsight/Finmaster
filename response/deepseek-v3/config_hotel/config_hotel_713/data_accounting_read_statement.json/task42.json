The line item related to cash payments for PP&E and other long-term assets is typically found under the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section.\n\n2. **Identify the Line Item**: Within the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section, we look for a line item that describes the purchase or acquisition of fixed assets. In the given problem, this line item is labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is the amount of cash paid to acquire PP&E and other long-term assets. In the provided problem, this value is \"0.00.\"\n\n4. **Verify the Value**: The value is confirmed by checking the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" which is \"-0.00,\" indicating that the only transaction in this section is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of \"0.00.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'} }\n```",
