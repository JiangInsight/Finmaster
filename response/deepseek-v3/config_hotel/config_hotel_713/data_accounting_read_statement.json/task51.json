This account represents interest that has been earned but not yet received. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Value**: \n   - In the balance sheet, under the \"Interest Receivable\" account, the \"Initial_amount\" is listed as \"0.00\" with the \"Initial_date\" of \"2023-12-31\".\n   \n2. **End Value**: \n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Interest Receivable\" is \"9881.70\" with the \"End_date\" of \"2024-02-05\".\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - The income statement also lists \"Interest Income\" as \"9881.70\", which matches the \"End_amount\" of \"Interest Receivable\", confirming that this is the interest accrued but not yet received by the end date.\n\nThus, the initial and end values for interest accrued but not yet received are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '9881.70'} }\n```",
