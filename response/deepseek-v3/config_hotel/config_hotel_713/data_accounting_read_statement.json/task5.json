These assets are typically categorized under \"Inventory\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - From the given balance sheet, the line item that represents assets held for sale or in production is \"Inventory\".\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Inventory\" is listed as \"0.00\" under the \"Initial_amount\" column with the \"Initial_date\" of \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Inventory\" is listed as \"7848830.00\" under the \"End_amount\" column with the \"End_date\" of \"2024-02-05\".\n\n4. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The initial value is correctly \"0.00\" and the end value is \"7848830.00\", which aligns with the definition of assets held for sale or in production.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '7848830.00'} }\n```",
