Financing costs typically refer to expenses related to borrowing funds, such as interest expenses or other costs associated with loans and debts.\n2. **Identify Relevant Line Item**: In the income statement provided, the line item \"Financial Expenses\" is the most likely candidate for financing costs. This is because financial expenses generally include interest expenses and other costs related to raising funds.\n3. **Locate the Value**: In the given income statement, the \"Financial Expenses\" line item has a value of \"2220.62\".\n4. **Verify**: There are no other line items that seem to represent financing costs (e.g., \"Interest Income\" is income, not an expense). Therefore, \"Financial Expenses\" is the correct line item to extract.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2220.62'}}\n```",
