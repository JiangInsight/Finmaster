This line item is typically labeled as \"Depreciation\" in the income statement.\n\nLooking at the provided income statement, we can see the following line item:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Depreciation | 91488.35 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThe value associated with \"Depreciation\" is \"91488.35\". This is the amount that represents the accumulated systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life for the given period.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91488.35'}}\n```",
