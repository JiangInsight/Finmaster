These liabilities are typically classified as \"Current Liabilities\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Liabilities**: \n   - Current liabilities are obligations that are expected to be settled within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually within one year). \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Current Liabilities\" are \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\". The total of these items is given as \"Total Current Liabilities\".\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `5042389.63` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-02-05`.\n\n3. **Verify the Calculation**:\n   - The \"Total Current Liabilities\" is the sum of \"Accounts Payable\" (`5015020.00`) and \"Taxes Payable\" (`27369.63`), which equals `5042389.63`. This matches the given \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '5042389.63'}}\n```",
