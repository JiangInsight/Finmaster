                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement extraction task step by step. I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we need.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific values from the financial statements:\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares** (from the Balance Sheet)\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense** (from the Income Statement)\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period** (from the Cash Flow Statement)\n\nThe order is important: Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement, then Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet - Capital Contributed by Shareholders\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, the line item that represents capital contributed by shareholders is typically called \"Paid-in Capital\" or \"Share Capital.\" \n\nIn the given Balance Sheet:\n- **Paid-in Capital**: Initial_amount = 16000000.00, End_amount = 16000000.00\n\nThis means the capital contributed by shareholders is **16000000.00**. This will be our `value1`.\n\n### 2. Income Statement - Profit Before Tax\nFrom the Income Statement, we need the profit or loss before tax expense. This is usually labeled as \"Profit Before Tax\" or \"Income Before Tax.\"\n\nIn the given Income Statement:\n- **Profit Before Tax**: Amount = 83867.48\n\nSo, the profit before tax is **83867.48**. This will be our `value2`.\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement - Increase in Accounts Payable\nThe third item is the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period. This is essentially the increase in accounts payable, which is found in the Cash Flow Statement under operating activities.\n\nIn the Cash Flow Statement:\n- **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: Amount = 5015020.00\n\nThis represents the increase in the amount owed (accounts payable) during the period, which is **5015020.00**. This will be our `value3`.\n\n### Verifying the Values\nLet's quickly check if these are the correct line items:\n- **Paid-in Capital**: Yes, it's the capital shareholders have put in.\n- **Profit Before Tax**: Directly matches the requirement.\n- **Increase in Accounts Payable**: Represents additional credit purchases or services received on credit.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16000000.00', 'value2': '83867.48', 'value3': '5015020.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. **Balance Sheet**: Located \"Paid-in Capital\" with an end amount of 16000000.00 (`value1`).\n2. **Income Statement**: Found \"Profit Before Tax\" as 83867.48 (`value2`).\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**: Identified \"Increase in Accounts Payable\" as 5015020.00 (`value3`).\n4. Combined these in the specified order to form the solution.",
