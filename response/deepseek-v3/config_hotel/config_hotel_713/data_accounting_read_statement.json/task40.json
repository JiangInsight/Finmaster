This is typically reflected in the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" line item under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are looking for the increase in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit. This is captured by the \"Accounts Payable\" line item in the cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is present with an amount of \"5015020.00\".\n\n3. **Verify the Context**: The \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is indeed the line item that shows the change in the amount owed by the entity for credit purchases or services received during the period. A positive value indicates an increase in the amount owed (i.e., the entity has more liabilities for goods/services received on credit).\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value for this line item is \"5015020.00\".\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5015020.00'} }\n```",
