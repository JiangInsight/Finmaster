                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line items and values of tangible items that are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes. These items are typically classified as \"Fixed Assets\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - From the balance sheet provided, the line item that represents tangible items held for use in production, rental, or administrative purposes is \"Fixed Assets\". This is because fixed assets include property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) which are used in operations.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Fixed Assets\" is given as `8000000.00` as of the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Fixed Assets\" is given as `8000000.00` as of the end date `2024-02-05`. However, we also notice that there is an \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item, which is typically subtracted from the gross fixed assets to get the net fixed assets. \n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" at the end date is `91488.35`, so the net fixed assets would be `8000000.00 - 91488.35 = 7908511.65`. This is reflected in the \"Total Non-current Assets\" line.\n   - However, the task asks for the value of the tangible items themselves (likely the gross value before depreciation), so we should use the \"Fixed Assets\" line item value directly.\n\n4. **Determine Which Value to Use**:\n   - The example provided in the task uses the \"Fixed Assets\" line item directly (before depreciation) for both initial and end values. Therefore, we will do the same here.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
