I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the required values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to extract two specific line items from the provided financial statements:\n\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received**: This is typically found as \"Interest Receivable\" in the balance sheet. It represents interest income that has been earned but not yet received in cash.\n   \n2. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is usually found in the cash flow statement under \"Net Increase\" or similar, representing the net change in cash and cash equivalents over the period.\n\nThe financial statements are grouped in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, we should maintain the original line item order as shown.\n\n### Given Financial Statements\n\nWe have three sections:\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**\n   - Contains \"Interest Receivable\" with an \"End_amount\" of 9881.70.\n   \n2. **Income Statement**\n   - Contains \"Interest Income\" of 9881.70, but this is not the accrued interest; it's the income recognized.\n   \n3. **Cash Flow Statement**\n   - Contains \"Net Increase\" in \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" of -2868695.86.\n\n### Identifying the Required Values\n\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received (\"Interest Receivable\")**:\n   - Found in the Balance Sheet under \"Interest Receivable\".\n   - End_amount: 9881.70.\n   \n2. **Net addition in cash and cash equivalents**:\n   - Found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Net Increase\".\n   - Amount: -2868695.86.\n\n### Verifying the Values\n\n- **Interest Receivable**: \n  - In the Balance Sheet, \"Interest Receivable\" starts at 0.00 and ends at 9881.70, meaning 9881.70 is the accrued interest not yet received.\n  \n- **Net Increase in Cash**:\n  - In the Cash Flow Statement, \"Net Increase\" is -2868695.86, which is the net change in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n### Potential Confusions\n\nInitially, one might think \"Interest Income\" from the Income Statement is the accrued interest, but that's the income recognized, not necessarily the amount not yet received. The \"Interest Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet is the correct item for interest accrued but not received.\n\nSimilarly, for cash addition, one might look at \"Ending Balance\" in the Cash Flow Statement, but \"Net Increase\" directly gives the net change, which is what's asked for.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully reviewing all sections, the correct values are:\n\n- value1 (Interest accrued but not yet received): '9881.70'\n- value2 (Net addition in cash and cash equivalents): '-2868695.86'\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '9881.70', 'value2': '-2868695.86'} }\n```",
