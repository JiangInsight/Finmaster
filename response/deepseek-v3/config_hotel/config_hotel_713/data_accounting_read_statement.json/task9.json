The relevant line item is \"Taxes Payable,\" which represents taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Line Item**: Look for the account labeled \"Taxes Payable\" in the balance sheet. This account shows the amount of tax that has been accrued but not yet paid.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**: The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\" is the value at the \"Initial_date\" (2023-12-31). From the table, this value is \"0.00\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**: The \"End_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\" is the value at the \"End_date\" (2024-02-05). From the table, this value is \"27369.63\".\n\n4. **Format the Solution**: Present the extracted values in the required JSON format.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '27369.63'} }\n```",
