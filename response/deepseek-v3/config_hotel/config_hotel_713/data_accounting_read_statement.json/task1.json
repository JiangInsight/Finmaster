                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line items and values of cash held by the entity that is available for use in its day-to-day operations. This typically includes \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" as these are the most liquid assets readily available for operational use.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**:\n   - \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" are the line items that represent cash available for day-to-day operations.\n   - Other items like \"Interest Receivable,\" \"Accounts Receivable,\" and \"Inventory\" are not considered as cash available for immediate use.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Values**:\n   - \"Cash on Hand\" initial amount: 3000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31).\n   - \"Bank Deposits\" initial amount: 5000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31).\n   - Total initial cash available: 3000000.00 + 5000000.00 = 8000000.00.\n\n3. **Extract End Values**:\n   - \"Cash on Hand\" end amount: 2179154.14 (as of 2024-02-05).\n   - \"Bank Deposits\" end amount: 2952150.00 (as of 2024-02-05).\n   - Total end cash available: 2179154.14 + 2952150.00 = 5131304.14.\n\n4. **Verify Against Total Current Assets**:\n   - The sum of initial cash (8000000.00) matches the \"Total Current Assets\" initial amount (8000000.00), confirming consistency.\n   - The sum of end cash (5131304.14) does not match the \"Total Current Assets\" end amount (13190375.83) because the latter includes other current assets like \"Accounts Receivable\" and \"Inventory.\"\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The initial value of cash available for day-to-day operations is the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" initial amounts: 8000000.00.\n   - The end value of cash available for day-to-day operations is the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" end amounts: 5131304.14.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '5131304.14'} }\n```",
