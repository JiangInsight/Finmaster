This is because COGS reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, including the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the goods.\n   \n2. **Identifying the Line Item**: In the given income statement, the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is present with an amount of \"353220.00\".\n\n3. **Verification**: The \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is the correct line item to represent the carrying amount of inventories sold, as it directly relates to the cost associated with the inventory that was sold during the period.\n\n4. **Extracting the Value**: The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is \"353220.00\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '353220.00'}}\n```",
