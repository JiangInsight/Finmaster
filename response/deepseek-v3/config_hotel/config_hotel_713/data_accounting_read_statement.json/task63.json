I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we need.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific values from the financial statements:\n1. **Amounts of taxes accrued but not yet paid**: This is typically found in the **Balance Sheet** under \"Taxes Payable\".\n2. **Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities**: This is usually the \"Total Revenue\" in the **Income Statement**.\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities**: This is the \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" in the **Cash Flow Statement**.\n\nThe order to present these is:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet - Taxes Payable\nLooking at the Balance Sheet provided, we have a line item:\n```\nTaxes Payable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 27369.63 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThe \"End_amount\" is `27369.63`, which represents the taxes accrued but not yet paid at the end of the period.\n\n**Value1: 27369.63**\n\n### 2. Income Statement - Total Revenue\nIn the Income Statement, we see:\n```\nTotal Revenue | 547392.30 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThis is the total income from ordinary activities.\n\n**Value2: 547392.30**\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\nIn the Cash Flow Statement, the relevant line is:\n```\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -2868695.86 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThis is the net cash generated from operating activities.\n\n**Value3: -2868695.86**\n\n### Verifying the Order\nJust to ensure, the order is:\n1. Balance Sheet (Taxes Payable)\n2. Income Statement (Total Revenue)\n3. Cash Flow Statement (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities)\n\nAll values match this order.\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '27369.63', 'value2': '547392.30', 'value3': '-2868695.86'} }\n```",
