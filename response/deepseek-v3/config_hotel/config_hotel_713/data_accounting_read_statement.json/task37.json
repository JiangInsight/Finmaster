Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. In cash flow statements, depreciation is typically listed under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" because it is a non-cash expense that is added back to net profit to calculate cash flow from operations.\n\n2. **Analyze the Given Cash Flow Statement**: \n   - The cash flow statement provided has a section titled \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\".\n   - Under this section, there is a line item labeled \"Depreciation\" with an amount of \"91488.35\" dated \"2024-02-05\".\n\n3. **Verify the Line Item**: \n   - The \"Depreciation\" line item matches the description of the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.\n   - No other line items in the statement fit this description.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: \n   - The value associated with the \"Depreciation\" line item is \"91488.35\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91488.35'}}\n```",
