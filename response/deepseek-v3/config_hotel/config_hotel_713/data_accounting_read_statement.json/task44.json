The ending balance of cash and cash equivalents is typically reported at the bottom of the statement.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, there are three line items:\n   - Beginning Balance\n   - Ending Balance\n   - Net Increase\n\n3. **Identify the Ending Balance**: The \"Ending Balance\" line item directly provides the value of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period. In the given problem, this value is \"5131304.14\".\n\n4. **Verify the Net Increase**: The \"Net Increase\" should match the sum of the net cash flows from operating and investing activities. Here, the net cash flow from operating activities is \"-2868695.86\" and from investing activities is \"-0.00\", which sums to \"-2868695.86\". This matches the \"Net Increase\" value, confirming the consistency of the statement.\n\n5. **Extract the Ending Balance**: The value to be extracted is the \"Ending Balance\" of \"5131304.14\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5131304.14'}}\n```",
