This is typically reflected in the \"Accounts Receivable\" line item in the cash flow statement under the \"Operating Activities\" section.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are looking for the line item that shows the change in accounts receivable, which indicates the decrease (or increase) in amounts owed to the entity by customers for goods or services sold on credit.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is present under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\".\n3. **Interpret the Value**: The value associated with this line item is \"-200359.99\". A negative value indicates an increase in accounts receivable (meaning less cash was collected than the sales made on credit), while a positive value would indicate a decrease (more cash was collected than the sales made on credit). However, the task asks for the \"decrease in amounts owed\", which would be the opposite of an increase. Since the value is negative, it actually represents an increase, not a decrease. But the line item itself is labeled as \"(Increase) Decrease\", so the value is correctly representing the change.\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value to extract is \"-200359.99\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-200359.99'}}\n```",
