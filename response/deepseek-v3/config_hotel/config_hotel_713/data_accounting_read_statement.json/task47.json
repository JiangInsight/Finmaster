Additionally, we need to decompose this item into 2 component sub-items, both of which must originate from the input statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents:**\n   - From the given cash flow statement, the line item \"Net Increase\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" shows the value of `-2868695.86`. This is the net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\n2. **Identify the Sub-Items:**\n   - The net increase in cash and cash equivalents is calculated as the difference between the \"Ending Balance\" and the \"Beginning Balance\" of cash and cash equivalents.\n   - From the statement:\n     - \"Beginning Balance\" is `8000000.00`.\n     - \"Ending Balance\" is `5131304.14`.\n\n3. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - The net increase should be the ending balance minus the beginning balance: `5131304.14 - 8000000.00 = -2868695.86`. This matches the given \"Net Increase\" value, confirming the correctness of the sub-items.\n\n4. **Prepare the Solution:**\n   - The value of the net increase is `-2868695.86`.\n   - The two sub-items are the \"Beginning Balance\" (`8000000.00`) and the \"Ending Balance\" (`5131304.14`).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-2868695.86\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value1\": \"8000000.00\", \"sub_item value2\": \"5131304.14\"}}}\n```",
