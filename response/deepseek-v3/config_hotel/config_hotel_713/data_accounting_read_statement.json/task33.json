The income arising from the entity's core operating activities.\n2. The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Income from Core Operating Activities**:\n   - The core operating activities of a business typically generate revenue from its main business operations. In the income statement provided, the line item \"Main Business Revenue\" clearly represents the income arising from the entity's core operating activities.\n   - The value associated with \"Main Business Revenue\" is `547392.30`.\n\n2. **Identify Carrying Amount of Inventories Sold**:\n   - The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) in the income statement. This line item reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the entity.\n   - The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is `353220.00`.\n\n3. **Order of Line Items**:\n   - The original order of the line items in the income statement is \"Main Business Revenue\" followed by \"Cost of Goods Sold\". Therefore, `value1` corresponds to \"Main Business Revenue\" and `value2` corresponds to \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '547392.30', 'value2': '353220.00'}}\n```",
