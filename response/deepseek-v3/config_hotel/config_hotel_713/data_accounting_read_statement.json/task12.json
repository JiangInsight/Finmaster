These are typically classified as \"Current Assets\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Assets**: Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within one year or the operating cycle of the business, whichever is longer. In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of all such assets.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Current Assets\" is `8000000.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Assets\" is `13190375.83` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-02-05`.\n\n3. **Verify Non-Current Assets**: For completeness, we can note that \"Total Non-current Assets\" are not part of the operating cycle and thus are not included in the solution.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The initial and end values of the total current assets are the values we need to report.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '13190375.83'}}\n```",
