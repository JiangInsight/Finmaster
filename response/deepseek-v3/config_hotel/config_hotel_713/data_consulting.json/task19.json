                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Current Ratio and the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: This measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations with its current assets. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: This shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n\n- **Total Current Assets (End_date: 2024-02-05)**: 13,190,375.83\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_date: 2024-02-05)**: 5,042,389.63\n- **Inventory**:\n  - Initial_amount (2023-12-31): 0.00\n  - End_amount (2024-02-05): 7,848,830.00\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 353,220.00\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{13,190,375.83}{5,042,389.63}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{13,190,375.83}{5,042,389.63} \\approx 2.615\n\\]\n\nSo, the Current Ratio is approximately **2.62**.\n\n### Calculating the Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\nFirst, find the Average Inventory:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2} = \\frac{0.00 + 7,848,830.00}{2} = \\frac{7,848,830.00}{2} = 3,924,415.00\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} = \\frac{353,220.00}{3,924,415.00}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{353,220.00}{3,924,415.00} \\approx 0.09\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, this seems unusually low. Let me double-check the numbers.\n\n- COGS: 353,220.00\n- Average Inventory: 3,924,415.00\n- Ratio: 353,220 / 3,924,415 ≈ 0.09\n\nThis implies the inventory is turning over very slowly, which might be correct given the high inventory and relatively low COGS for the period. However, let's see if there's any mistake.\n\nLooking back at the initial example provided, the Inventory Turnover Ratio was calculated based on the COGS over the average inventory, and in that case, it was:\n\n- COGS: 4,410,000.00\n- Average Inventory: (0 + 5,090,000)/2 = 2,545,000\n- Ratio: 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73\n\nSimilarly, here:\n\n- COGS: 353,220\n- Average Inventory: (0 + 7,848,830)/2 = 3,924,415\n- Ratio: 353,220 / 3,924,415 ≈ 0.09\n\nThis seems correct mathematically, but it's a very low turnover, which might indicate that the inventory is not being sold quickly. Maybe the period is short (from Dec 31 to Feb 5, so about 1 month), and the COGS is for that period, leading to a low annualized turnover.\n\nAlternatively, if the COGS is annualized, but the inventory is as of a point in time, the ratio might be higher. But based on the given data and the method in the example, it's correct to use the provided COGS directly.\n\nHowever, in the initial example, the Inventory Turnover Ratio was given as 1.73 with similar time frames, so maybe there's a different approach. Maybe the COGS is annualized or the inventory is averaged differently.\n\nWait, in the initial example:\n\n- Initial_date: 2023-12-31\n- End_date: 2024-01-30 (about 1 month)\n- COGS: 4,410,000 (for that month)\n- Inventory: 0 to 5,090,000\n- Ratio: 1.73\n\nHere:\n\n- Initial_date: 2023-12-31\n- End_date: 2024-02-05 (about 1 month and 5 days)\n- COGS: 353,220 (for that period)\n- Inventory: 0 to 7,848,830\n- Ratio: 0.09\n\nThe initial example's ratio was higher because COGS was higher relative to average inventory. Here, COGS is much lower relative to average inventory, hence the lower ratio.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct unless the COGS is supposed to be annualized, but since the initial example didn't annualize, I'll proceed with the direct calculation.\n\n### Final Calculations\n\n- **Current Ratio**: 13,190,375.83 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ 2.62\n- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: 353,220 / 3,924,415 ≈ 0.09\n\nBut given that the initial example had a ratio of 1.73 with a similar setup, maybe the COGS is for a longer period or the inventory is not averaged. Alternatively, maybe the inventory turnover is calculated without averaging if the beginning inventory is zero.\n\nIf we don't average (since beginning is zero), then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Ending Inventory}} = \\frac{353,220}{7,848,830} \\approx 0.045\n\\]\n\nThis is even lower. Maybe the initial example had a typo, or the COGS is for a longer period.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct approach is to average the inventory, even if beginning is zero, leading to 0.09.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratios are annualized. If the period is about 1 month, then annual COGS would be 353,220 * 12 ≈ 4,238,640, then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{4,238,640}{3,924,415} \\approx 1.08\n\\]\n\nBut the initial example didn't seem to annualize, as their COGS was 4,410,000 for about 1 month, and ratio was 1.73 (which is 4,410,000 / 2,545,000).\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll stick with the direct calculation without annualizing, leading to 0.09.\n\nBut looking back, the initial example's solution was {'Current Ratio': '4.27', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '1.73'}, where:\n\n- Current Assets: 7,956,806.47\n- Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\n- Ratio: 7,956,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 4.27 (matches)\n- COGS: 4,410,000\n- Avg Inventory: (0 + 5,090,000)/2 = 2,545,000\n- Ratio: 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73 (matches)\n\nSo, the method is clear: use the given COGS and average inventory.\n\nApplying same here:\n\n- COGS: 353,220\n- Avg Inventory: (0 + 7,848,830)/2 = 3,924,415\n- Ratio: 353,220 / 3,924,415 ≈ 0.09\n\nThis seems correct based on the method, even if the number seems low.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '2.62', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.09'} }\n```",
