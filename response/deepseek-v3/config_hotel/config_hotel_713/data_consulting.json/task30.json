                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each ratio one by one using the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 13,190,375.83\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 5,042,389.63\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 13,190,375.83 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ 2.615\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 2,179,154.14\n- Bank Deposits = 2,952,150.00\n- Interest Receivable = 9,881.70\n- Accounts Receivable = 200,359.99\n- Total Current Liabilities = 5,042,389.63\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 2,179,154.14 + 2,952,150.00 + 9,881.70 + 200,359.99 ≈ 5,341,545.83\n\nQuick Ratio = 5,341,545.83 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ 1.059\n\n*Note:* Sometimes, Interest Receivable might not be included in quick assets. If we exclude it:\nQuick Assets = 2,179,154.14 + 2,952,150.00 + 200,359.99 ≈ 5,331,664.13\nQuick Ratio = 5,331,664.13 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ 1.057\nThe difference is minimal, so I'll go with including it: ≈ 1.06\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since there are no non-current liabilities listed) = 5,042,389.63\n- Total Assets = 21,098,887.48\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 5,042,389.63 / 21,098,887.48 ≈ 0.239\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 5,042,389.63\n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,056,497.85\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 5,042,389.63 / 16,056,497.85 ≈ 0.314\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -2,868,695.86\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 5,042,389.63\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -2,868,695.86 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ -0.569\n\n*Note:* This ratio is negative, indicating that the operating cash flow is negative relative to debt, which isn't favorable.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '2.62', 'Quick Ratio': '1.06', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.24', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.31', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.57'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check the calculations quickly:\n\n1. Current Ratio: 13,190,375.83 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ 2.615 → 2.62\n2. Quick Ratio: (2,179,154.14 + 2,952,150.00 + 9,881.70 + 200,359.99) / 5,042,389.63 ≈ 5,341,545.83 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ 1.059 → 1.06\n3. Debt to Asset: 5,042,389.63 / 21,098,887.48 ≈ 0.239 → 0.24\n4. Debt to Equity: 5,042,389.63 / 16,056,497.85 ≈ 0.314 → 0.31\n5. Cash Flow to Debt: -2,868,695.86 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ -0.569 → -0.57\n\nAll calculations seem correct based on the provided data. The ratios are rounded to two decimal places for clarity.",
