                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: This ratio measures a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   Here, \"Total Debt\" can be considered as the \"Total Current Liabilities\" since that's the debt that needs to be serviced in the short term.\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the provided financial statements:\n\n**Income Statement:**\n- Total Revenue: \\$547,392.30\n- Gross Profit: \\$194,172.30\n\n**Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$2,868,695.86\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Liabilities: \\$5,042,389.63\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{194,172.30}{547,392.30} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[\n\\frac{194,172.30}{547,392.30} \\approx 0.3547\n\\]\n\\[\n0.3547 \\times 100 \\approx 35.47\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **35.47%**.\n\n### Calculating Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-2,868,695.86}{5,042,389.63}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\n\\frac{-2,868,695.86}{5,042,389.63} \\approx -0.569\n\\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-0.57**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit / Total Revenue = 194,172.30 / 547,392.30 ≈ 0.3547 → 35.47%\n   - This seems correct.\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   - Operating Cash Flow = -\\$2,868,695.86\n   - Total Current Liabilities = \\$5,042,389.63\n   - Ratio = -2,868,695.86 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ -0.569\n   - Rounded to two decimal places: -0.57\n   - This also seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating and verifying, the results are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '35.47%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.57'} }\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- The Gross Profit Margin of 35.47% indicates that for every dollar of revenue, the company retains about 35 cents after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This seems healthy, but context is needed (industry standards, etc.).\n- The Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is negative (-0.57), which suggests that the company's operating cash flow is insufficient to cover its current liabilities. This could be a concern regarding the company's short-term financial health.\n  \nIt's always good to compare these ratios with industry benchmarks or historical data to get a better sense of the company's performance.",
