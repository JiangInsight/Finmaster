                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the four requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities listed) = 5,042,389.63\n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,056,497.85\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 5,042,389.63 / 16,056,497.85 ≈ 0.314\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:** Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 56,497.85\n- Total Revenue = 547,392.30\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (56,497.85 / 547,392.30) * 100 ≈ 10.32%\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:** ROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets = 21,098,887.48\n- Net Profit = 56,497.85\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (56,497.85 / 21,098,887.48) * 100 ≈ 0.27%\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:** Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since no info on cash sales is given), Net Credit Sales = Total Revenue = 547,392.30\n\nFor Average Accounts Receivable:\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable (from initial balance sheet) = 0.00\n- Ending Accounts Receivable = 200,359.99\n- Average = (0 + 200,359.99) / 2 = 100,179.995\n\nCalculation:\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 547,392.30 / 100,179.995 ≈ 5.46\n\nHowever, since the initial accounts receivable is 0, this might not be meaningful. Alternatively, if we consider only the ending accounts receivable (as sometimes done when beginning is zero), it would be:\n547,392.30 / 200,359.99 ≈ 2.73\n\nBut given the example provided seems to use ending accounts receivable (since initial was zero there too and they got 4.47), I'll go with:\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / Ending Accounts Receivable = 547,392.30 / 200,359.99 ≈ 2.73\n\nWait, in the example, initial AR was 0, end AR was 2,429,482.13, and revenue was 5,431,018.59, so:\n5,431,018.59 / 2,429,482.13 ≈ 2.24, but they had 4.47, which suggests they might have used average even with initial zero, which would be:\n5,431,018.59 / (0 + 2,429,482.13)/2 = 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 ≈ 4.47\n\nSo, to match their method, I should use average even if initial is zero:\nAverage AR = (0 + 200,359.99)/2 = 100,179.995\nTurnover = 547,392.30 / 100,179.995 ≈ 5.46\n\nBut their example calculation seems to have a discrepancy because with their numbers, average would give ~4.47, but direct division gives ~2.24. Maybe they used a different period or another method. Given that, I think using average is more standard, so I'll go with 5.46.\n\nBut looking back at their example:\nInitial AR: 0\nEnd AR: 2,429,482.13\nRevenue: 5,431,018.59\nThey got 4.47, which is Revenue / End AR * 2 (since initial is zero), which is like average where initial is zero.\n\nSo for ours:\n547,392.30 / 200,359.99 * 2 ≈ 5.46\n\nBut their calculation seems to be:\nRevenue / End AR = 5,431,018.59 / 2,429,482.13 ≈ 2.24, but they have 4.47, which is double that, implying they did Revenue / (End AR / 2), which is equivalent to 2 * (Revenue / End AR).\n\nSo to match their method:\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 2 * (Total Revenue / Ending Accounts Receivable) = 2 * (547,392.30 / 200,359.99) ≈ 5.46\n\nBut their example numbers don't match this, because 2 * (5,431,018.59 / 2,429,482.13) ≈ 4.47, which is what they have. So their method is indeed 2 * (Revenue / End AR), which is equivalent to Revenue / (End AR / 2), treating initial as zero.\n\nSo applying that:\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 2 * (547,392.30 / 200,359.99) ≈ 5.46\n\nBut their example with similar numbers gave 4.47, which is 2 * (Revenue / End AR), so I think 5.46 is correct here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they annualized it, but since both are for one month, not sure.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with 5.46.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.31', 'Net Profit Margin': '10.32%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '0.27%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '5.46'}}\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, their Net Profit was negative, so margin was negative. Here, our net profit is positive, so margin is positive. Similarly, ROA is positive here but was negative there. \n\nDebt to Equity in example was 0.16 (total liabilities / equity = 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.16), which matches their calculation. Here, it's 5,042,389.63 / 16,056,497.85 ≈ 0.31.\n\nROA in example was -1,645,141.43 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ -0.1245 or -12.45%, they have -12.55%, close enough. Here it's 56,497.85 / 21,098,887.48 ≈ 0.0027 or 0.27%.\n\nNet Profit Margin in example was -1,645,141.43 / 5,431,018.59 ≈ -0.3029 or -30.29%, matching theirs. Here it's 56,497.85 / 547,392.30 ≈ 0.1032 or 10.32%.\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover in example was 5,431,018.59 / (2,429,482.13 / 2) ≈ 4.47, matching theirs. Here it's 547,392.30 / (200,359.99 / 2) ≈ 5.46.\n\nSo all calculations seem correct based on their method.\n\nFinal JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.31', 'Net Profit Margin': '10.32%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '0.27%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '5.46'}}\n```",
