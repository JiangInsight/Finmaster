                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Asset Ratio, the Gross Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 5,042,389.63\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 5,042,389.63\n- **Total Assets:** 21,098,887.48\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{5,042,389.63}{21,098,887.48} \\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5,042,389.63}{21,098,887.48} \\approx 0.239 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.24.\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 194,172.30\n- **Total Revenue:** 547,392.30\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{194,172.30}{547,392.30} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{194,172.30}{547,392.30} \\approx 0.3547 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.3547 \\times 100\\% \\approx 35.47\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately 35.47%.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -2,868,695.86\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 5,042,389.63\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-2,868,695.86}{5,042,389.63} \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-2,868,695.86}{5,042,389.63} \\approx -0.569 \\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately -0.57.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all these into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.24', 'Gross Profit Margin': '35.47%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.57'} }\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the ratios were given with two decimal places for Debt to Asset and Operating Cash Flow, and Gross Profit Margin was rounded to two decimal places as well. Following that format:\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.24 (already two decimal places)\n- Gross Profit Margin: 35.47% (rounded to two decimal places)\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -0.57 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, the final answer remains as above. \n\nBut wait, in the example, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio was -3.90, which seems to be more precise. Maybe I should keep more decimal places initially. Let me recalculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio with more precision:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-2,868,695.86}{5,042,389.63} \\approx -0.5689 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: -0.57\n\nSimilarly, Debt to Asset:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5,042,389.63}{21,098,887.48} \\approx 0.2390 \\] → 0.24\n\nGross Profit Margin:\n\n\\[ \\frac{194,172.30}{547,392.30} \\approx 0.3547 \\] → 35.47%\n\nSo, it seems correct as is. Maybe the example had different numbers leading to -3.90. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.24', 'Gross Profit Margin': '35.47%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.57'} }\n```",
