                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested metrics based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nFree Cash Flow is typically calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} - \\text{Capital Expenditures} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -2,868,695.86\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (Capital Expenditures): 0.00\n\nSo,\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = -2,868,695.86 - 0 = -2,868,695.86 \\]\n\nBut looking at the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents, it's also -2,868,695.86, which matches. So FCF is -2,868,695.86.\n\n### 2. Return on Assets (ROA)\nROA is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\nWhere Average Total Assets = (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Total Assets: 16,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets: 21,098,887.48\n- Net Income (from income statement): 56,497.85\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{16,000,000 + 21,098,887.48}{2} = \\frac{37,098,887.48}{2} = 18,549,443.74 \\]\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\frac{56,497.85}{18,549,443.74} \\approx 0.003046 \\text{ or } 0.3046\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Return on Equity (ROE)\nROE is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Average Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\nWhere Average Shareholders' Equity = (Beginning Equity + Ending Equity) / 2\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Equity: 16,000,000.00\n- Ending Equity: 16,056,497.85\n- Net Income: 56,497.85\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Equity} = \\frac{16,000,000 + 16,056,497.85}{2} = \\frac{32,056,497.85}{2} = 16,028,248.925 \\]\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{56,497.85}{16,028,248.925} \\approx 0.003524 \\text{ or } 0.3524\\% \\]\n\n### 4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\nThis is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -2,868,695.86\n- Net Income: 56,497.85\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-2,868,695.86}{56,497.85} \\approx -50.78 \\]\n\nThis seems unusually high in magnitude and negative, which might indicate that the company's operating cash flow is significantly negative compared to its net income, possibly due to large increases in working capital (like inventory).\n\n### 5. Net Profit Margin\nNet Profit Margin is:\n\\[ \\text{Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Income: 56,497.85\n- Total Revenue: 547,392.30\n\n\\[ \\text{Margin} = \\frac{56,497.85}{547,392.30} \\approx 0.1032 \\text{ or } 10.32\\% \\]\n\n### 6. Gross Profit Margin\nGross Profit Margin is:\n\\[ \\text{Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit: 194,172.30\n- Total Revenue: 547,392.30\n\n\\[ \\text{Margin} = \\frac{194,172.30}{547,392.30} \\approx 0.3547 \\text{ or } 35.47\\% \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nNow, compiling all these calculations into the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-2868695.86', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '0.30%', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.35%', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-50.78', 'Net Profit Margin': '10.32%', 'Gross Profit Margin': '35.47%'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me quickly verify the calculations, especially the ROA and ROE percentages since they seem quite low.\n\n- ROA: 56,497.85 / 18,549,443.74 ≈ 0.003046 → 0.30% ✔\n- ROE: 56,497.85 / 16,028,248.925 ≈ 0.003524 → 0.35% ✔\n\nThe Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is indeed very negative, which aligns with the large negative operating cash flow compared to a small positive net income. \n\nEverything checks out!",
