                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios: the Quick Ratio and the Net Profit Margin. \n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\n1. **Quick Ratio (also known as the Acid-Test Ratio):**\n   - This measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n   - Formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n     \\]\n   - **Quick Assets** typically include:\n     - Cash and cash equivalents\n     - Marketable securities\n     - Accounts receivable\n     - (Note: Inventory is **not** included because it's not as liquid)\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - This shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue.\n   - Formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n     \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the provided financial statements, let's extract the necessary information.\n\n#### Balance Sheet (as of 2024-02-05):\n\n- **Quick Assets:**\n  - Cash on Hand: 2,179,154.14\n  - Bank Deposits: 2,952,150.00\n  - Interest Receivable: 9,881.70\n  - Accounts Receivable: 200,359.99\n  - (Inventory: 7,848,830.00) — *Not included in quick assets*\n  \n  Total Quick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n  = 2,179,154.14 + 2,952,150.00 + 9,881.70 + 200,359.99\n  = ?\n\n  Let's add them up:\n  - 2,179,154.14 + 2,952,150.00 = 5,131,304.14\n  - 5,131,304.14 + 9,881.70 = 5,141,185.84\n  - 5,141,185.84 + 200,359.99 = 5,341,545.83\n\n- **Current Liabilities:**\n  - Accounts Payable: 5,015,020.00\n  - Taxes Payable: 27,369.63\n  - Total Current Liabilities: 5,042,389.63\n\n#### Income Statement (for the period ending 2024-02-05):\n\n- **Net Profit:** 56,497.85\n- **Total Revenue:** 547,392.30\n\n### Calculating the Quick Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{5,341,545.83}{5,042,389.63}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n5,341,545.83 ÷ 5,042,389.63 ≈ 1.059\n\nSo, the Quick Ratio is approximately **1.06**.\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the Quick Ratio was given to two decimal places. Should we round to two decimal places here as well? \n\n1.059 rounded to two decimal places is 1.06.\n\nBut let me double-check the addition of quick assets to ensure no mistake.\n\nRecalculating Quick Assets:\n- Cash on Hand: 2,179,154.14\n- Bank Deposits: 2,952,150.00\n  Subtotal: 5,131,304.14\n- Interest Receivable: 9,881.70\n  Subtotal: 5,141,185.84\n- Accounts Receivable: 200,359.99\n  Total: 5,341,545.83\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 5,042,389.63\n\n5,341,545.83 ÷ 5,042,389.63 ≈ 1.059 → 1.06\n\n### Calculating the Net Profit Margin\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{56,497.85}{547,392.30} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nFirst, divide Net Profit by Total Revenue:\n\n56,497.85 ÷ 547,392.30 ≈ 0.1032\n\nThen multiply by 100 to get percentage:\n\n0.1032 × 100 ≈ 10.32%\n\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is approximately **10.32%**.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the example provided:\n\n- Quick Ratio was calculated as 1.54\n- Net Profit Margin was -30.29%\n\nOur calculations seem to follow the same method, so our approach appears correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '1.06', 'Net Profit Margin': '10.32%'} }\n```\n\n*Wait*, just to ensure, let me cross-validate the quick assets components. Sometimes, \"Interest Receivable\" might not be considered a quick asset, but in the example, it was included (as the quick ratio was higher than if it wasn't included). \n\nIf we exclude Interest Receivable:\n\nQuick Assets = 5,341,545.83 - 9,881.70 = 5,331,664.13\n\nQuick Ratio = 5,331,664.13 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ 1.057 → still 1.06 when rounded.\n\nSo, inclusion or exclusion doesn't change the rounded value in this case.\n\nSimilarly, for Net Profit Margin, the calculation seems straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is correct as above.\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary:\n\n1. **Identify Quick Assets:**\n   - Cash on Hand: 2,179,154.14\n   - Bank Deposits: 2,952,150.00\n   - Interest Receivable: 9,881.70\n   - Accounts Receivable: 200,359.99\n   - Total: 5,341,545.83\n\n2. **Identify Current Liabilities:**\n   - Total: 5,042,389.63\n\n3. **Calculate Quick Ratio:**\n   - 5,341,545.83 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ 1.059 → **1.06**\n\n4. **Calculate Net Profit Margin:**\n   - Net Profit: 56,497.85\n   - Total Revenue: 547,392.30\n   - (56,497.85 / 547,392.30) × 100 ≈ 10.32%\n\n### Final JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '1.06', 'Net Profit Margin': '10.32%'} }\n```",
