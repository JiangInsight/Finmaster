                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio** based on the provided financial statements. \n\n### Understanding the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nFirst, what is the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio? From what I understand, it's a measure of a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- **Operating Cash Flow** is the net cash provided by operating activities (from the cash flow statement).\n- **Total Debt** is the sum of all the company's liabilities that represent debt (usually found in the balance sheet).\n\n### Identifying the Components from the Given Data\n\n1. **Operating Cash Flow**:\n   - From the cash flow statement, under \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\", the amount is **-2,868,695.86**.\n\n2. **Total Debt**:\n   - This is a bit tricky. In the balance sheet, under liabilities, we have:\n     - Accounts Payable: 5,015,020.00\n     - Taxes Payable: 27,369.63\n     - Total Current Liabilities: 5,042,389.63\n   - There are no long-term liabilities listed here, so the total debt would be the total current liabilities, which is **5,042,389.63**.\n\n   *Wait a minute*, is all of \"Total Current Liabilities\" considered debt? Typically, debt refers to borrowings like loans, bonds, etc. Accounts payable and taxes payable are liabilities, but are they considered debt for this ratio?\n\n   - **Accounts Payable**: This is money owed to suppliers, not necessarily debt from borrowing.\n   - **Taxes Payable**: This is owed to the government, also not traditional debt.\n   \n   Hmm, the balance sheet doesn't show any loans or notes payable, which are typical debt items. Maybe in this case, since there's no explicit debt listed, we might consider total liabilities as debt, but that might not be accurate.\n\n   Looking back at the example provided:\n   - In the example, the \"Total Current Liabilities\" was 1,861,550.92, and that was used as the denominator in the ratio calculation.\n   - The solution was: -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 â‰ˆ -3.90.\n   \n   So, it seems that in the example, \"Total Current Liabilities\" was treated as \"Total Debt\". Maybe in this context, since no other debt is specified, we use total current liabilities.\n\n   Therefore, for our problem, we'll use **Total Current Liabilities = 5,042,389.63** as the Total Debt.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nNow, plug the numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Total Debt}} = \\frac{-2,868,695.86}{5,042,389.63} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-2,868,695.86}{5,042,389.63} \\approx -0.5689 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: **-0.57**\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nJust to ensure this makes sense:\n- Negative operating cash flow means the company is burning cash in operations.\n- The ratio is negative, indicating that the operating cash flow isn't sufficient to cover the debt (in fact, it's negative).\n- The magnitude is less than 1, meaning the operating cash flow (even if positive) wouldn't cover the total debt.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully going through the steps, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-0.57**.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.57'} }\n```",
