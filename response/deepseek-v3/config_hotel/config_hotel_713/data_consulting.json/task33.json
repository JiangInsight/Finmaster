                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio one by one using the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -2,868,695.86\nFrom the balance sheet (End_amount):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 5,042,389.63\n\nCalculation:\n= -2,868,695.86 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ -0.57\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt\n\nFirst, we need to determine Total Debt. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are:\n- Accounts Payable = 5,015,020.00\n- Taxes Payable = 27,369.63\nTotal Current Liabilities = 5,042,389.63 (which seems to be the total debt as there are no long-term liabilities listed)\n\nCalculation:\n= -2,868,695.86 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ -0.57\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- COGS = 353,220.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00\n- Ending Inventory = 7,848,830.00\nAverage Inventory = (Initial + Ending) / 2 = (0 + 7,848,830) / 2 = 3,924,415.00\n\nCalculation:\n= 353,220.00 / 3,924,415.00 ≈ 0.09\n\nWait a minute, this seems very low. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the initial inventory again. The initial inventory is 0, and ending is 7,848,830. Maybe the company started with no inventory and purchased all during the period. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the entire inventory was purchased during the period, perhaps the average should be just the ending inventory (since initial is zero and all inventory was added during the period). \n\nBut typically, average inventory is (beginning + ending)/2. So, with beginning at 0, it's half of ending. \n\nGiven that, the ratio is indeed 0.09, which suggests very low turnover, meaning inventory isn't being sold quickly.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (Debt) = 5,042,389.63\n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,056,497.85\n\nCalculation:\n= 5,042,389.63 / 16,056,497.85 ≈ 0.31\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:**  \nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 13,190,375.83\n- Inventory = 7,848,830.00\n- Current Liabilities = 5,042,389.63\n\nQuick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 13,190,375.83 - 7,848,830.00 = 5,341,545.83\n\nCalculation:\n= 5,341,545.83 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ 1.06\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nCurrent Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = 13,190,375.83\n- Current Liabilities = 5,042,389.63\n\nCalculation:\n= 13,190,375.83 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ 2.62\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.57', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.57', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.09', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.31', 'Quick Ratio': '1.06', 'Current Ratio': '2.62'}}\n```\n\n**Reviewing the Inventory Turnover Ratio:**\nGiven that the initial inventory was 0 and ending is 7,848,830, and COGS is 353,220, the ratio is indeed low. This might imply that most of the inventory was purchased but not sold during the period, leading to a low turnover. \n\nAlternatively, if the inventory was purchased and sold within the period, the average inventory might be better represented by the ending inventory alone, making the ratio even lower (353,220 / 7,848,830 ≈ 0.045). However, standard practice is to use average inventory when possible, so sticking with 0.09 seems appropriate unless more data is available.\n\nAll other calculations seem correct based on the provided data.",
