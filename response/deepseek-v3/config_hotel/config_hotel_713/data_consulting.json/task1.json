                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Current Ratio based on the given balance sheet information. \n\n### Understanding the Current Ratio\nFirst, I recall that the **Current Ratio** is a financial metric used to assess a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations (those due within a year). It's calculated by dividing the **Total Current Assets** by the **Total Current Liabilities**.\n\nThe formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n### Identifying the Relevant Data\nFrom the provided balance sheet, I need to find:\n1. **Total Current Assets** at the end of the reporting period.\n2. **Total Current Liabilities** at the end of the reporting period.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- **Total Current Assets**:\n  - Initial_amount: 8,000,000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n  - End_amount: 13,190,375.83 (as of 2024-02-05)\n  \n  Since we're interested in the end of the reporting period (2024-02-05), we'll use the End_amount: **13,190,375.83**.\n\n- **Total Current Liabilities**:\n  - Initial_amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n  - End_amount: 5,042,389.63 (as of 2024-02-05)\n  \n  Again, using the End_amount: **5,042,389.63**.\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{13,190,375.83}{5,042,389.63} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n1. Divide 13,190,375.83 by 5,042,389.63:\n   - 5,042,389.63 goes into 13,190,375.83 approximately 2.615 times.\n   \n   To be precise:\n   - 5,042,389.63 × 2 = 10,084,779.26\n   - Subtract from 13,190,375.83: 13,190,375.83 - 10,084,779.26 = 3,105,596.57\n   - 5,042,389.63 × 0.6 ≈ 3,025,433.78 (since 0.6 × 5,042,389.63 = 3,025,433.778)\n   - Adding up: 2 + 0.6 = 2.6, and there's a small remainder, making it approximately 2.615.\n\nBut let's calculate it more accurately:\n\n\\[ \\frac{13,190,375.83}{5,042,389.63} \\approx 2.6159 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: **2.62**\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nJust to ensure I didn't make a mistake, let's verify:\n\n- 5,042,389.63 × 2.6159 ≈ ?\n  - 5,042,389.63 × 2 = 10,084,779.26\n  - 5,042,389.63 × 0.6 = 3,025,433.778\n  - 5,042,389.63 × 0.01 = 50,423.8963\n  - 5,042,389.63 × 0.005 = 25,211.94815\n  - Adding these up: 10,084,779.26 + 3,025,433.778 + 50,423.8963 + 25,211.94815 ≈ 13,185,848.88245\n  - The actual numerator is 13,190,375.83, so the difference is about 4,526.94755, which suggests the multiplication is slightly off. Maybe a better approximation is 2.616.\n\nBut for practical purposes, 2.62 seems reasonable based on initial division.\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator:\n\n13,190,375.83 ÷ 5,042,389.63 ≈ 2.6159 ≈ 2.62\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter carefully calculating, the Current Ratio is approximately **2.62**.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '2.62'} }\n```",
