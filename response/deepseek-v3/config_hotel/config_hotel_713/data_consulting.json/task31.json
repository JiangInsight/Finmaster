                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand where each number comes from.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all sales are credit sales) = Main Business Revenue = 547,392.30\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable = 0.00 (from initial balance sheet)\n- Ending Accounts Receivable = 200,359.99\n\n**Average Accounts Receivable:**\n\\[ \\text{Average AR} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning AR} + \\text{Ending AR}}{2} = \\frac{0 + 200,359.99}{2} = 100,179.995 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{AR Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{547,392.30}{100,179.995} \\approx 5.46 \\]\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -2,868,695.86\n- Current Liabilities = 5,042,389.63\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-2,868,695.86}{5,042,389.63} \\approx -0.57 \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis seems to be the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the example provided (both had the same value). So:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = -0.57 \\]\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Sales}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Sales = Total Revenue = 547,392.30\n- Beginning Total Assets = 16,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets = 21,098,887.48\n\n**Average Total Assets:**\n\\[ \\text{Average TA} = \\frac{16,000,000 + 21,098,887.48}{2} = \\frac{37,098,887.48}{2} = 18,549,443.74 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{547,392.30}{18,549,443.74} \\approx 0.03 \\]\n\n*Wait a minute, this seems very low compared to the example. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check.*\n\nLooking back at the example:\n- Their Total Revenue was 5,431,018.59\n- Average Total Assets = (13,000,000 + 13,216,409.49)/2 ≈ 13,108,204.745\n- Their ratio was 5,431,018.59 / 13,108,204.745 ≈ 0.41\n\nIn our case, sales are much lower relative to assets, so 0.03 seems correct.\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 5,042,389.63 (since no long-term liabilities are listed)\n- Total Shareholders' Equity = 16,056,497.85\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{5,042,389.63}{16,056,497.85} \\approx 0.31 \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '5.46', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-0.57', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.57', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.03', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.31'} }\n```\n\n**Wait, let me cross-validate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:**\n\nIn the example:\n- Net Sales: 5,431,018.59\n- Average AR: (0 + 2,429,482.13)/2 = 1,214,741.065\n- Ratio: 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 ≈ 4.47 (matches their given value)\n\nIn our case:\n- Net Sales: 547,392.30\n- Average AR: (0 + 200,359.99)/2 = 100,179.995\n- Ratio: 547,392.30 / 100,179.995 ≈ 5.46\n\nThis seems correct. The higher ratio here is because sales are proportionally higher compared to receivables than in the example.\n\nSimilarly, the Total Asset Turnover Ratio is indeed much lower here because sales are very small relative to the asset base.\n\nEverything checks out!",
