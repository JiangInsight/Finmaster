                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Equity Ratio, the Net Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of debt financing relative to equity financing. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities listed):** 5,042,389.63\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 16,056,497.85\n\nWait a minute, in the balance sheet, under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" it's listed as 5,042,389.63, and there are no other liabilities mentioned like long-term debts. So, total liabilities are just the current liabilities here.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{5,042,389.63}{16,056,497.85} \\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5,042,389.63}{16,056,497.85} \\approx 0.314 \\]\n\nBut looking at the example provided, their Debt to Equity Ratio was calculated as Total Current Liabilities divided by Total Owner's Equity, even though typically it's total liabilities (current + non-current) over equity. Here, since only current liabilities are present, we'll proceed with that.\n\nWait, in the example, they had:\n\nTotal Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\nTotal Owner's Equity: 11,354,858.57\nDebt to Equity Ratio: 0.16\n\nCalculating that:\n\n1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.1639, which matches their given '0.16'.\n\nSimilarly, in our case:\n\n5,042,389.63 / 16,056,497.85 ≈ 0.314\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any other liabilities. The balance sheet shows:\n\n- Accounts Payable: 5,015,020.00\n- Taxes Payable: 27,369.63\n- Total Current Liabilities: 5,042,389.63\n- No other liabilities listed.\n\nSo, it seems correct to use Total Current Liabilities as total liabilities here.\n\nThus, Debt to Equity Ratio ≈ 0.31\n\nBut to match the format, let's present it to two decimal places: '0.31'\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net profit is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** 56,497.85\n- **Total Revenue:** 547,392.30\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{56,497.85}{547,392.30} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n56,497.85 / 547,392.30 ≈ 0.1032\n\n0.1032 * 100 ≈ 10.32%\n\nLooking at the example, they had:\n\nNet Profit: -1,645,141.43\nTotal Revenue: 5,431,018.59\nNet Profit Margin: -30.29%\n\nCalculating that:\n\n(-1,645,141.43 / 5,431,018.59) * 100 ≈ -30.29%, which matches.\n\nSo, our Net Profit Margin is approximately '10.32%'\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to cover its current liabilities with cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -2,868,695.86\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 5,042,389.63\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-2,868,695.86}{5,042,389.63} \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n-2,868,695.86 / 5,042,389.63 ≈ -0.569\n\nIn the example, they had:\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,259,994.10\nTotal Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\nRatio: -3.90\n\nCalculating that:\n\n-7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.90, which matches.\n\nSo, our ratio is approximately '-0.57'\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all three ratios:\n\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.31\n- Net Profit Margin: 10.32%\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: -0.57\n\nIn the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.31', 'Net Profit Margin': '10.32%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.57'} }\n```",
