Current liabilities typically include amounts owed to suppliers (accounts payable) and other short-term obligations that are unpaid by the end of the period.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Current Liabilities:**\n   - The initial current liabilities are the amounts owed to suppliers at the beginning of the period (2023-12-31) that are marked as \"Unpaid\" with a payment method of \"Account Payable\".\n   - From the data, the only initial unpaid purchase is:\n     - `Purchase20231231002`: Amount = 829,440.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n   - There are no other initial current liabilities mentioned.\n\n2. **Identify Additional Current Liabilities During the Period:**\n   - We need to look for all purchases marked as \"Unpaid\" with a payment method of \"Account Payable\" that occurred during the period (from 2024-01-01 onwards).\n   - From the data, the following purchases are unpaid and should be included in current liabilities:\n     - `Purchase20231231004`: Amount = 1,250,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231005`: Amount = 246,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231007`: Amount = 140,800.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231008`: Amount = 254,320.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231011`: Amount = 540,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231013`: Amount = 585,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231014`: Amount = 755,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231015`: Amount = 59,850.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231019`: Amount = 32,850.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231022`: Amount = 19,050.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231023`: Amount = 358,500.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231024`: Amount = 402,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n\n3. **Calculate Total Current Liabilities:**\n   - Initial Current Liabilities: 829,440.00\n   - Additional Current Liabilities:\n     - 1,250,000.00 (Purchase20231231004)\n     - 246,000.00 (Purchase20231231005)\n     - 140,800.00 (Purchase20231231007)\n     - 254,320.00 (Purchase20231231008)\n     - 540,000.00 (Purchase20231231011)\n     - 585,000.00 (Purchase20231231013)\n     - 755,000.00 (Purchase20231231014)\n     - 59,850.00 (Purchase20231231015)\n     - 32,850.00 (Purchase20231231019)\n     - 19,050.00 (Purchase20231231022)\n     - 358,500.00 (Purchase20231231023)\n     - 402,000.00 (Purchase20231231024)\n   - Total Additional Current Liabilities: 4,844,370.00\n   - Total Current Liabilities (Initial + Additional): 829,440.00 + 4,844,370.00 = 5,673,810.00\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   - The initial current liabilities are 829,440.00.\n   - The end current liabilities are 5,673,810.00.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Current Liabilities Initial Value\": \"829440.00\", \"Total Current Liabilities End Value\": \"5673810.00\"}}\n```",
