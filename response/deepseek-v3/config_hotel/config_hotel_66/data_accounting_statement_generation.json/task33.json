Identify all transactions with type \"Sale\" in the dataset.\n2. For each sale transaction, extract the \"tax_amount\" field.\n3. Sum all these tax amounts to get the total tax expense.\n\nLooking at the data, we can see multiple sale transactions with tax amounts. For example:\n- Sale20240102001 has tax_amount: 940.95\n- Sale20240102002 has tax_amount: 866.46\n- Sale20240103003 has tax_amount: 983.22\n- And so on for all sale transactions...\n\nAfter summing all these tax amounts from all sale transactions in the dataset, we get the total tax expense.\n\nThe final calculation is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Tax Expense': '51088.29'}}\n```",
