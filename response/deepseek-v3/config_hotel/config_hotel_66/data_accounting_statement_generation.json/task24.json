We need to sum the `amount` or `recorded_amount` (they are the same in this dataset) for all these transactions.\n\n2. **List of Purchase Transactions**:\n   - Purchase20231231001: 371520.0\n   - Purchase20231231002: 829440.0\n   - Purchase20231231003: 35000.0\n   - Purchase20231231004: 1250000.0\n   - Purchase20231231005: 246000.0\n   - Purchase20231231006: 582000.0\n   - Purchase20231231007: 140800.0\n   - Purchase20231231008: 254320.0\n   - Purchase20231231009: 240240.0\n   - Purchase20231231010: 216000.0\n   - Purchase20231231011: 540000.0\n   - Purchase20231231012: 177000.0\n   - Purchase20231231013: 585000.0\n   - Purchase20231231014: 755000.0\n   - Purchase20231231015: 59850.0\n   - Purchase20231231016: 820800.0\n   - Purchase20231231017: 80500.0\n   - Purchase20231231018: 328000.0\n   - Purchase20231231019: 32850.0\n   - Purchase20231231020: 36050.0\n   - Purchase20231231021: 35850.0\n   - Purchase20231231022: 19050.0\n   - Purchase20231231023: 358500.0\n   - Purchase20231231024: 402000.0\n\n3. **Sum of Purchase Transactions**:\n   - Sum all the above amounts:\n     - 371520.0 + 829440.0 + 35000.0 + 1250000.0 + 246000.0 + 582000.0 + 140800.0 + 254320.0 + 240240.0 + 216000.0 + 540000.0 + 177000.0 + 585000.0 + 755000.0 + 59850.0 + 820800.0 + 80500.0 + 328000.0 + 32850.0 + 36050.0 + 35850.0 + 19050.0 + 358500.0 + 402000.0 = 8,000,000.0\n\n4. **Other Cost-Related Transactions**:\n   - The initial fixed assets and deposits are not part of the cost of goods sold or operating expenses, so they are not included in the total cost for the income statement.\n   - Expenses (Administrative, Sales, Financial, etc.) are part of operating expenses but are not part of the \"Total Cost\" as typically defined in the income statement (which is usually Cost of Goods Sold or COGS). \n   - Depreciation is an expense but not part of COGS unless it is directly tied to production (which it doesn't appear to be here).\n\n5. **Final Total Cost**:\n   - The total cost is the sum of all purchase transactions, which is 8,000,000.0. This represents the cost of goods purchased (COGS).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Cost': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
