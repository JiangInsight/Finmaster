These are typically the non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets and accumulated depreciation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Non-Current Assets**: \n   - Non-current assets are those that are not expected to be converted into cash or used up within one year or the operating cycle of the business. In the given balance sheet, the relevant line items are:\n     - Fixed Assets\n     - Accumulated Depreciation\n     - Total Non-current Assets\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Total Non-current Assets\" line item directly provides the aggregated value of non-current assets at the initial and end dates.\n   - From the table:\n     - Initial value of Total Non-current Assets: 8000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End value of Total Non-current Assets: 7908490.06 (as of 2024-02-01)\n\n3. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The initial value of Fixed Assets is 8000000.00, and the initial Accumulated Depreciation is 0.00, so the initial Total Non-current Assets is indeed 8000000.00.\n   - The end value of Fixed Assets is 8000000.00, and the end value of Accumulated Depreciation is 91509.94, so the end value of Total Non-current Assets is 8000000.00 - 91509.94 = 7908490.06, which matches the given value.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '7908490.06'} }\n```",
