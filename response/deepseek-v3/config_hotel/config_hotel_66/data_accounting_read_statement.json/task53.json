This represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company.\n   \n2. **Locate the Value in the Income Statement**: In the provided income statement, the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" line item is present with an amount of `562950.00` for the date `2024-02-01`.\n\n3. **Verify the Context**: The balance sheet shows that the inventory increased by `7832820.00` (from `0.00` to `7832820.00`), which is reflected in the cash flow statement as an increase in inventory. However, the actual cost of the inventory sold is what we are interested in, and this is correctly represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the income statement.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The value of the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is `562950.00`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '562950.00'}}\n```",
