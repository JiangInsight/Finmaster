The line item we are interested in (cash payments for PP&E and other long-term assets) typically appears under the \"Investing Activities\" section.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: Within the \"Investing Activities\" section, look for a line item that describes payments for fixed assets or long-term assets. In the provided example, this line item is labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" line item is the amount we need to extract. In the given problem, this value is \"0.00.\"\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: Ensure that the line item and value make sense in the context of the cash flow statement. Here, \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is clearly related to cash outflows for acquiring long-term assets, and the value is explicitly provided.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'}}\n```",
