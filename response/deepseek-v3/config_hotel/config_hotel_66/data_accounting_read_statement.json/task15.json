Specifically, we are interested in the \"Total Owner's Equity\" line, which gives the total equity at the initial date and the end date.\n\nHere are the steps to extract the required information:\n\n1. **Initial Value of Total Owner's Equity**: \n   - Look for the row with \"Total Owner's Equity\" in the \"Account\" column.\n   - The initial value is given in the \"Initial_amount\" column, which is '16000000.00'.\n\n2. **End Value of Total Owner's Equity**: \n   - The end value is given in the \"End_amount\" column for the same row, which is '16146127.58'.\n\nThus, the initial and end values of the total equity are:\n- Initial value: '16000000.00'\n- End value: '16146127.58'\n\nThe solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '16000000.00', 'end value': '16146127.58'} }\n```",
