These items are typically classified as \"Fixed Assets\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - From the given balance sheet, the line item that represents tangible items held for use in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes is \"Fixed Assets\".\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Fixed Assets\" is provided as \"8000000.00\" on the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Fixed Assets\" is provided as \"8000000.00\" on the end date \"2024-02-01\". However, we also need to consider the \"Accumulated Depreciation\" which is subtracted from the \"Fixed Assets\" to get the net value. \n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" at the end date is \"91509.94\".\n   - Therefore, the net end value of the fixed assets is \"8000000.00 - 91509.94 = 7908490.06\". This is also reflected in the \"Total Non-current Assets\" line.\n\n4. **Determine the Correct Value**:\n   - The question asks for the value of tangible items, which is typically the gross value (before depreciation). However, in the example provided, the \"end value\" was the net value (after depreciation). To be consistent with the example, we will use the net value.\n   - Thus, the initial value is \"8000000.00\" and the end value is \"7908490.06\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '7908490.06'} }\n```",
