I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we need.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific values from the financial statements:\n1. **Amounts of taxes accrued but not yet paid**: This is typically found in the **Balance Sheet** under \"Taxes Payable.\"\n2. **Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities**: This is usually the \"Total Revenue\" in the **Income Statement**.\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities**: This is the \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" in the **Cash Flow Statement**.\n\nThe order to present these is:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet - Taxes Payable\nLooking at the Balance Sheet provided, we have the following line:\n```\n| Taxes Payable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 43168.61 | 2024-02-01 |\n```\nThe \"End_amount\" is the current amount of taxes payable, which is `43168.61`.\n\n### 2. Income Statement - Total Revenue\nIn the Income Statement, we see:\n```\n| Total Revenue | 863371.65 | 2024-02-01 |\n```\nThis is the total income from ordinary activities, which is `863371.65`.\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\nIn the Cash Flow Statement, we find:\n```\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -2419019.09 | 2024-02-01 |\n```\nThis is the net cash generated from operating activities, which is `-2419019.09`.\n\n### Verifying the Order\nJust to ensure we're following the correct order:\n1. Balance Sheet: Taxes Payable\n2. Income Statement: Total Revenue\n3. Cash Flow Statement: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\nAll values are correctly identified in their respective statements.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '43168.61', 'value2': '863371.65', 'value3': '-2419019.09'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. **Balance Sheet**: Located \"Taxes Payable\" with the end amount of `43168.61`.\n2. **Income Statement**: Found \"Total Revenue\" as `863371.65`.\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**: Identified \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" as `-2419019.09`.\n4. Ordered them as per the instructions: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement.\n5. Compiled the values into the JSON format.\n\nThis should correctly solve the given task.",
