This typically refers to the \"Accounts Payable\" line item in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: The amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit is recorded under \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n2. **Check the Balance Sheet**: \n   - Initial amount of \"Accounts Payable\" on 2023-12-31: 0.00\n   - End amount of \"Accounts Payable\" on 2024-02-01: 5,472,810.00\n\n3. **Determine the Addition**: The addition to the amount owed during the period is the difference between the end amount and the initial amount. Since the initial amount is 0.00, the addition is simply the end amount.\n\n4. **Verify with Cash Flow Statement**: \n   - The cash flow statement also shows the increase in \"Accounts Payable\" under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" as 5,472,810.00, which confirms the addition.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is 5,472,810.00.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5472810.00'}}\n```",
