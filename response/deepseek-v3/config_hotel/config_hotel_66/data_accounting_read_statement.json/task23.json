In financial statements, income from financial assets is typically reported as \"Interest Income\" or \"Dividend Income\" under the revenue or other income section.\n   \n2. **Analyze the Given Income Statement**: Looking at the provided income statement, we can see the following line items:\n   - Main Business Revenue\n   - Total Revenue\n   - Cost of Goods Sold\n   - Total Cost\n   - Gross Profit\n   - Administrative Expenses\n   - Selling Expenses\n   - Depreciation\n   - Financial Expenses\n   - Total Expenses\n   - **Interest Income**\n   - Profit Before Tax\n   - Tax Expense\n   - Net Profit\n\n3. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: The line item \"Interest Income\" represents income earned from financial assets (such as bonds, savings accounts, or other interest-bearing instruments). This is the value we need to extract.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Interest Income\" is `9066.78`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '9066.78'}}\n```",
