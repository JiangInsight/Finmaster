Since neither of the required line items appears in the Balance Sheet, we skip it.\n   - The first value (`value1`) is from the Income Statement (\"Selling Expenses\").\n   - The second value (`value2`) is from the Cash Flow Statement (\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\").\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '7553.67', 'value2': '0.00'} }\n```",
