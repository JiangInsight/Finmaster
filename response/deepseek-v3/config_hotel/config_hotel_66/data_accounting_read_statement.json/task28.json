This is typically labeled as \"Tax Expense\" or something similar in the income statement.\n\n2. **Review the Income Statement**: Look through the provided income statement to locate the line item related to taxes.\n\n3. **Identify the Tax Line Item**: In the given income statement, the line item \"Tax Expense\" is present with an amount of \"43168.61\" and a date of \"2024-02-01\".\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Tax Expense\" is \"43168.61\", which represents the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay or recover during the reporting period.\n\n5. **Verify**: Ensure that there are no other line items related to taxes (e.g., deferred tax, tax credits) that might need to be considered. In this case, only \"Tax Expense\" is present, so no further adjustments are needed.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '43168.61'} }\n```",
