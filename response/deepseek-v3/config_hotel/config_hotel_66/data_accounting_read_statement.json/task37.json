This line item is typically labeled as \"Depreciation\" in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task asks for the value of depreciation, which is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. This is a non-cash expense that is added back to net profit in the cash flow statement.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, look for the line item labeled \"Depreciation\" under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with the \"Depreciation\" line item is the amount we need to extract.\n\n### Application to the Given Problem:\n- In the provided cash flow statement, the \"Depreciation\" line item is present under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" with a value of \"91509.94\" for the date \"2024-02-01\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91509.94'} }\n```",
