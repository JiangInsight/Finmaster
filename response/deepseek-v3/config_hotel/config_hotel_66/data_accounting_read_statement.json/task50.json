I'm going to identify and extract the four specific line items and their values from the given cash flow statement based on the descriptions provided in the task.\n\n### Understanding the Task:\nWe need to find four specific items in the cash flow statement:\n\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is typically referred to as \"Depreciation\" in the cash flow statement.\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period**: This usually corresponds to the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" line item.\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends**: This is generally the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n### Given Cash Flow Statement:\nLet's look at the provided cash flow statement and identify these items.\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-01 |\n| Net Profit  | 146127.58 | 2024-02-01 |\n| **Depreciation**  | **91509.94** | 2024-02-01 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -330748.44 | 2024-02-01 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -9066.78 | 2024-02-01 |\n| **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**  | **-7832820.00** | 2024-02-01 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 5472810.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 43168.61 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -2419019.09 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-02-01 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 0.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n| **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**  | **-0.00** | 2024-02-01 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-01 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Ending Balance  | 5580980.91 | 2024-02-01 |\n| **Net Increase**  | **-2419019.09** | 2024-02-01 |\n\n### Identifying the Four Values:\n\n1. **Depreciation**: \n   - Line item: \"Depreciation\"\n   - Amount: 91509.94\n   - This matches the first description about the systematic allocation of depreciation.\n\n2. **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**:\n   - Line item: \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\"\n   - Amount: -7832820.00\n   - This represents the change in inventory, which is the reduction (or increase) in assets held for sale.\n\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - Line item: \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\"\n   - Amount: -0.00\n   - This is the net cash flow from investing activities, which includes acquisitions and disposals of long-term assets.\n\n4. **Net Increase**:\n   - Line item: \"Net Increase\"\n   - Amount: -2419019.09\n   - This is the net change in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\n### Verifying with the Example:\nLooking at the provided example, the four values were:\n- value1: Depreciation\n- value2: (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\n- value3: Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n- value4: Net Increase\n\nThis matches our identification above.\n\n### Final Answer:\nNow, let's put these values into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91509.94', 'value2': '-7832820.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '-2419019.09'} }\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary:\n1. **Depreciation**: Found under \"Depreciation\" with value 91509.94.\n2. **Inventory Change**: Found under \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with value -7832820.00.\n3. **Investing Activities**: Found under \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with value -0.00.\n4. **Net Cash Increase**: Found under \"Net Increase\" with value -2419019.09.\n\nAll values are correctly identified and placed in the specified order.",
