This is typically represented by the \"Depreciation\" line item in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Depreciation in the Balance Sheet**:\n   - In the balance sheet, \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is listed under \"Fixed Assets\". The end amount for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is `91509.94` as of `2024-02-01`. This represents the total depreciation accumulated over time.\n\n2. **Identify Depreciation in the Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - In the cash flow statement, there is a line item \"Depreciation\" with the amount `91509.94` as of `2024-02-01`. This represents the depreciation expense for the period.\n\n3. **Identify Depreciation in the Income Statement**:\n   - In the income statement, there is a line item \"Depreciation\" with the amount `91509.94` as of `2024-02-01`. This also represents the depreciation expense for the period.\n\n4. **Consistency Across Statements**:\n   - The depreciation amount is consistent across all three statements (`91509.94`), confirming that this is the correct value for the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of the depreciation expense is `91509.94`.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91509.94'} }\n```",
