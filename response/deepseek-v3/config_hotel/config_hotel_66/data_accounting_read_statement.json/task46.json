I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the solution.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task is about analyzing a cash flow statement to extract specific information related to cash flows from investing activities. Here's what we need to do:\n\n1. **Identify the Net Amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents from Investing Activities**: This is the total cash generated or used in investing activities.\n2. **Break Down This Item into Sub-items**: Specifically, we're told to decompose it into 1 component sub-item, which should also come from the cash flow statement.\n3. **Output the Values**: For the main item and its sub-item(s).\n\nFrom the example provided, it seems that the main item is \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" and its sub-item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nLet's look at the provided cash flow statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-01 |\n| Net Profit  | 146127.58 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Depreciation  | 91509.94 | 2024-02-01 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -330748.44 | 2024-02-01 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -9066.78 | 2024-02-01 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -7832820.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 5472810.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 43168.61 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -2419019.09 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-02-01 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 0.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -0.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-01 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Ending Balance  | 5580980.91 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Net Increase  | -2419019.09 | 2024-02-01 |\n\n### Identifying the Required Items\n\n1. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: This is the main item we're interested in. From the table, it's listed as \"-0.00\" on 2024-02-01.\n   \n   - Value: \"-0.00\"\n\n2. **Sub-item**: The only sub-item under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which is \"0.00\" on 2024-02-01.\n   \n   - Sub-item value: \"0.00\"\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nIn the example provided:\n\n- Main value: \"-305354.43\" (Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities)\n- Sub-item: \"305354.43\" (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n\nNotice that the sub-item's value is the absolute value of the purchase (since purchases are outflows, they're negative in the cash flow, but the sub-item value is positive).\n\nIn our case, the purchase is \"0.00,\" so the sub-item value is \"0.00,\" and the net cash flow is \"-0.00.\"\n\n### Potential Confusion\n\nInitially, I wondered why the sub-item value in the example was positive when the purchase was positive in the table. But looking closely, in the example:\n\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: \"305354.43\"\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: \"-305354.43\"\n\nThis makes sense because purchasing assets is a cash outflow (negative for cash flow), but the sub-item is just the amount spent, so it's positive.\n\nIn our problem:\n\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: \"0.00\"\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: \"-0.00\"\n\nHere, no purchase means no outflow, so both are zero (with the net cash flow showing as negative zero, which is essentially zero).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nFollowing the structure from the example, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '0.00'}}}\n```\n\nHowever, looking at the example's JSON structure, it seems the sub_items are directly listed without an inner dictionary. Maybe it's:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '0.00'}}\n```\n\nGiven the instruction says to present in the following json format, and the example shows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-305354.43', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '305354.43'}}}\n```\n\nBut the instruction after says:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '______', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '______'} }\n```\n\nThis seems inconsistent. I think the correct format based on the instruction is the latter, without the inner dictionary.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '0.00'}}\n```\n\nBut to match the exact format in the instruction (which seems to differ from the example), I'll go with:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '0.00'}}\n```\n\nHowever, the example has 'sub_items' as a key with a dictionary inside, but the instruction shows 'sub_items_sub_item value'. Maybe it's a typo in the instruction. Given that, the most accurate based on the example is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '0.00'}}}\n```\n\nBut since the instruction specifies the format differently, I'll follow the instruction strictly:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '0.00'}}\n```\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '0.00'}}\n```",
