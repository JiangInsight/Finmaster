                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line item and value that represents the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit during the period. This is typically reflected in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section as \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task is to find the line item that shows the change in accounts receivable, which indicates the decrease (or increase) in amounts owed to the entity for credit sales or services.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is present under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities.\"\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with this line item is \"-330748.44.\" A negative value here indicates an increase in accounts receivable (i.e., amounts owed to the entity have increased), but the task specifically asks for the \"decrease\" in amounts owed. Since the value is negative, it actually represents an increase, not a decrease. However, the task description might be interpreted as asking for the raw value of the line item regardless of the sign, as seen in the example provided.\n4. **Verify with Example**: In the example, the solution extracted the raw value of \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" even though it was negative. Thus, we will follow the same approach here.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-330748.44'}}\n```",
