                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the correct values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe have three financial statements provided:\n1. **Balance Sheet**\n2. **Cash Flow Statement**\n3. **Income Statement**\n\nOur goal is to:\n- Identify and extract two specific line items:\n  1. The end value of funds deposited into a bank.\n  2. The income earned by an entity from financial assets.\n- Group these by the financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement.\n- Within each group, maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement.\n\nFrom the example given, it seems:\n- `value1` corresponds to \"Bank Deposits\" from the Balance Sheet (end_amount).\n- `value2` corresponds to \"Interest Income\" from the Income Statement (amount).\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nLet's look at the current problem's financial statements to find these values.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\nLooking for \"Bank Deposits\":\n```\n| Bank Deposits | 5000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 2698390.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n```\nThe end_amount here is `2698390.00`.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\nLooking for \"Interest Income\":\n```\n| Interest Income | 9066.78 | 2024-02-01 |\n```\nThe amount here is `9066.78`.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nIn the example, the Cash Flow Statement wasn't used for the two values. It seems the two values come from Balance Sheet and Income Statement only. But let's confirm if there's any other relevant info here that might correspond to the second value.\n\nLooking at the Cash Flow Statement, there's:\n```\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -9066.78 | 2024-02-01 |\n```\nThis is related to interest but seems to be about receivable changes, not income earned. So likely not the one we need.\n\nSimilarly, in the Balance Sheet, there's:\n```\n| Interest Receivable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 9066.78 | 2024-02-01 |\n```\nThis is the receivable, not the income earned from financial assets.\n\nSo, confirming, the two values are:\n1. Bank Deposits' end_amount from Balance Sheet.\n2. Interest Income from Income Statement.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nIn the example:\n- `value1`: '164645.57' (Bank Deposits' end_amount)\n- `value2`: '2672.87' (Interest Income)\n\nThis matches our understanding.\n\n### Extracting Values from Current Problem\n\nFrom the current problem:\n1. **Bank Deposits** (Balance Sheet):\n   - End_amount: `2698390.00`\n2. **Interest Income** (Income Statement):\n   - Amount: `9066.78`\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2698390.00', 'value2': '9066.78'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Identify the two required values**:\n   - Funds deposited into a bank: Found in Balance Sheet under \"Bank Deposits\" (end_amount).\n   - Income from financial assets: Found in Income Statement under \"Interest Income\" (amount).\n\n2. **Locate these in the provided statements**:\n   - Balance Sheet: \"Bank Deposits\" → End_amount = 2698390.00\n   - Income Statement: \"Interest Income\" → Amount = 9066.78\n\n3. **Verify no other statements are needed**:\n   - Cash Flow Statement doesn't provide the required values directly for this task.\n\n4. **Format the answer as per the example**:\n   - JSON with 'value1' and 'value2' corresponding to the two identified values.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2698390.00', 'value2': '9066.78'}}\n```",
