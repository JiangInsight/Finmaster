In cash flow statements, this is typically labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: Looking at the provided cash flow statement, we can see the following line items under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\":\n   - Net Profit\n   - Depreciation\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\n   - **Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable**\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\n3. **Identify the Correct Line Item**: The line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" corresponds to the increase in tax accrued but not yet paid. \n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" is `43168.61`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '43168.61'}}\n```",
