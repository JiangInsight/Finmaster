In the given cash flow statement, the \"Beginning Balance\" is listed as `8000000.00` with the date `2024-02-01`.\n\n4. **Verification**: To ensure this is correct, we can cross-check with the balance sheet. The balance sheet shows \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" under current assets, which are typical components of cash and cash equivalents. The sum of these at the initial date (`2023-12-31`) is `3000000.00 (Cash on Hand) + 5000000.00 (Bank Deposits) = 8000000.00`, which matches the \"Beginning Balance\" in the cash flow statement.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period is `8000000.00`.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
