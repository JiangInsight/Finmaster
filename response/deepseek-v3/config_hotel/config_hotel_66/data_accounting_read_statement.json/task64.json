I'm going to break it down to understand what each of the three values we need to extract represents and where to find them in the given financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to identify and extract three specific line items from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is typically known as \"Profit Before Tax\" or \"Earnings Before Tax (EBT)\". It's found in the Income Statement.\n   \n2. **The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This refers to the increase in \"Accounts Payable\". It's a liability that shows how much the company owes to its suppliers for credit purchases. This can be found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n\n3. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is the \"Paid-in Capital\" or \"Share Capital\" and is found in the Balance Sheet under the equity section.\n\nThe outputs should be grouped by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, we maintain the original line item order as shown in the input.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nLet's go through each financial statement to locate these items.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet section, we're interested in the \"Paid-in Capital\":\n\n```\n| Paid-in Capital | 16000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 16000000.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n```\n\nThis shows that the capital contributed by shareholders is `16000000.00`. \n\n**Value1: 16000000.00**\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nNext, we look for \"Profit Before Tax\" in the Income Statement:\n\n```\n| Profit Before Tax | 189296.19 | 2024-02-01 |\n```\n\nThis is the profit or loss before tax expense, which is `189296.19`.\n\n**Value2: 189296.19**\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nNow, we need the increase in \"Accounts Payable\" from the Cash Flow Statement:\n\n```\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 5472810.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n```\n\nThis indicates that the amount owed by the entity (increase in Accounts Payable) is `5472810.00`.\n\n**Value3: 5472810.00**\n\n### Verifying the Order\n\nThe order in which we present these values should be:\n\n1. Balance Sheet item (Paid-in Capital)\n2. Income Statement item (Profit Before Tax)\n3. Cash Flow Statement item (Increase in Accounts Payable)\n\nThis matches the required order.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16000000.00', 'value2': '189296.19', 'value3': '5472810.00'}}\n```\n\n### Cross-Checking with the Example\n\nJust to ensure I'm doing this correctly, let's look at the provided example:\n\n- **Value1**: '13000000.00' (Paid-in Capital from Balance Sheet)\n- **Value2**: '-1373590.51' (Profit Before Tax from Income Statement)\n- **Value3**: '1590000.00' (Increase in Accounts Payable from Cash Flow Statement)\n\nThis matches the structure I've followed, confirming that my approach is correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully reviewing each financial statement and identifying the relevant line items, the correct values are:\n\n- Paid-in Capital (Balance Sheet): `16000000.00`\n- Profit Before Tax (Income Statement): `189296.19`\n- Increase in Accounts Payable (Cash Flow Statement): `5472810.00`\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16000000.00', 'value2': '189296.19', 'value3': '5472810.00'}}\n```",
