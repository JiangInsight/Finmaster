This line item is typically called \"Retained Earnings.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Line Item**: Look for the account labeled \"Retained Earnings\" in the balance sheet. This account shows the cumulative profits or losses retained in the business after any distributions to shareholders (like dividends).\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**: The initial value of \"Retained Earnings\" is given under the \"Initial_amount\" column for the \"Retained Earnings\" row. In the provided problem, this value is \"0.00\" as of the \"Initial_date\" (2023-12-31).\n\n3. **Extract End Value**: The end value of \"Retained Earnings\" is given under the \"End_amount\" column for the \"Retained Earnings\" row. In the provided problem, this value is \"146127.58\" as of the \"End_date\" (2024-02-01).\n\n4. **Construct the Solution**: The solution is a JSON object with the initial and end values of \"Retained Earnings.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '146127.58'} }\n```",
