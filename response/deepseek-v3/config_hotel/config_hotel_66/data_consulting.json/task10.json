In this case, it is -2,419,019.09.\n\n2. **Identify the Current Liabilities**: This is found in the balance sheet under \"Total Current Liabilities\". In this case, it is 5,515,978.61.\n\n3. **Calculate the Ratio**: The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the numbers:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-2,419,019.09}{5,515,978.61} \\approx -0.4385\n   \\]\n   Rounding to two decimal places, we get -0.44.\n\n4. **Present the Solution**: The final answer is presented in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.44'} }\n```",
