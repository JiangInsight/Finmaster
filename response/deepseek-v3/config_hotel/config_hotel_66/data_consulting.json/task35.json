                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the required ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount): 13,753,616.13\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount): 5,515,978.61\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 13,753,616.13 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ 2.49\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n**Formula:** (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit: 300,421.65\n- Total Revenue: 863,371.65\n\nCalculation:\nGross Profit Margin = (300,421.65 / 863,371.65) * 100 ≈ 34.80%\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities: Total Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61 (since there are no non-current liabilities listed)\n- Total Assets: 21,662,106.19\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 5,515,978.61 / 21,662,106.19 ≈ 0.25\n\n### 4. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:** (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit: 146,127.58\n- Total Revenue: 863,371.65\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (146,127.58 / 863,371.65) * 100 ≈ 16.93%\n\n### 5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand: 2,882,590.91\n- Bank Deposits: 2,698,390.00\n- Total Cash and Cash Equivalents = 2,882,590.91 + 2,698,390.00 = 5,580,980.91\n- Current Liabilities: 5,515,978.61\n\nCalculation:\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = 5,580,980.91 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ 1.01\n\n### 6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -2,419,019.09\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -0.00\n- FCF is typically calculated as Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures. Here, Purchase of Fixed Assets is 0, so FCF is essentially the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities.\n\nHowever, looking at the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents, it's -2,419,019.09, which matches the operating cash flow since there's no investing cash outflow.\n\nSo, Free Cash Flow = -2,419,019.09\n\n### 7. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:** (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit: 146,127.58\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets: 21,662,106.19\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (146,127.58 / 21,662,106.19) * 100 ≈ 0.67%\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '2.49', 'Gross Profit Margin': '34.80%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.25', 'Net Profit Margin': '16.93%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '1.01', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-2419019.09', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '0.67%'} }\n```\n\n### Verification:\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: 13,753,616.13 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ 2.49 ✔\n2. **Gross Profit Margin**: 300,421.65 / 863,371.65 ≈ 0.348 → 34.8% ✔\n3. **Debt to Asset Ratio**: Only current liabilities are present, so 5,515,978.61 / 21,662,106.19 ≈ 0.25 ✔\n4. **Net Profit Margin**: 146,127.58 / 863,371.65 ≈ 0.1693 → 16.93% ✔\n5. **Cash to Current Debt Ratio**: (2,882,590.91 + 2,698,390.00) / 5,515,978.61 ≈ 1.01 ✔\n6. **FCF**: Matches the net decrease in cash, which is -2,419,019.09 ✔\n7. **ROA**: 146,127.58 / 21,662,106.19 ≈ 0.0067 → 0.67% ✔\n\nEverything checks out!",
