                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Equity Ratio\nFirst, I need to understand what the Debt to Equity Ratio is. From what I recall, it's a financial ratio that compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholders' equity. It's a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations through debt versus wholly owned funds.\n\nThe formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\n### Identifying the Components from the Balance Sheet\nNow, let's look at the given balance sheet to find the necessary numbers.\n\nFrom the balance sheet provided:\n\n1. **Total Current Liabilities**: This is given as \"Total Current Liabilities\" with an \"End_amount\" of 5,515,978.61.\n   \n   - Accounts Payable: 5,472,810.00\n   - Taxes Payable: 43,168.61\n   - Total Current Liabilities: 5,515,978.61\n\n2. **Total Owner's Equity**: This is given as \"Total Owner's Equity\" with an \"End_amount\" of 16,146,127.58.\n   \n   - Paid-in Capital: 16,000,000.00\n   - Retained Earnings: 146,127.58\n   - Total Owner's Equity: 16,146,127.58\n\nNow, the question is: What constitutes \"Total Liabilities\" in this context?\n\nIn the balance sheet, I see \"Total Current Liabilities\" but no separate line for long-term liabilities (like long-term debt). Typically, liabilities are divided into current (short-term) and non-current (long-term). Here, only current liabilities are listed, and there's no mention of non-current liabilities.\n\nGiven that, it seems that the company might not have any long-term debt or non-current liabilities at the end of the reporting period. Therefore, \"Total Liabilities\" would just be the \"Total Current Liabilities.\"\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check if there are any other liability accounts mentioned. Scanning through:\n\n- Accounts Payable: part of current liabilities\n- Taxes Payable: part of current liabilities\n- No other liabilities are listed under non-current.\n\nSo, it's safe to assume that Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\nNow, plug the numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} = \\frac{5,515,978.61}{16,146,127.58} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5,515,978.61}{16,146,127.58} \\approx 0.3416 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's approximately 0.34.\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nJust to ensure I didn't miss anything:\n\n- Total Liabilities: Only current liabilities are present, totaling 5,515,978.61.\n- Total Equity: 16,146,127.58.\n- Ratio: 5,515,978.61 / 16,146,127.58 â‰ˆ 0.34.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.34.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.34'} }\n```",
