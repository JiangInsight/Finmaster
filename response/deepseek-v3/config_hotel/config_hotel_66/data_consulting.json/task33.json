                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'll go through each ratio one by one, explaining how to calculate it based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operating activities. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -2,419,019.09\nFrom the balance sheet (end period):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-2,419,019.09}{5,515,978.61} \\approx -0.438 \\]\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the ability of a company to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nHere, \"Total Debt\" is essentially the total liabilities. From the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Debt = 5,515,978.61\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-2,419,019.09}{5,515,978.61} \\approx -0.438 \\]\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 562,950.00\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00 (at 2023-12-31)\n- Ending Inventory = 7,832,820.00 (at 2024-02-01)\n  \nAverage Inventory = (Initial + Ending) / 2 = (0 + 7,832,820) / 2 = 3,916,410.00\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{562,950.00}{3,916,410.00} \\approx 0.144 \\]\n\nWait a minute, this seems very low. Maybe I should consider that the initial inventory is zero, which might skew the average. Alternatively, sometimes only ending inventory is used if beginning is zero or not meaningful.\n\nIf we use only ending inventory:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{562,950.00}{7,832,820.00} \\approx 0.072 \\]\n\nThis still seems very low. Maybe the Cost of Goods Sold is for a shorter period, but the inventory is high. Alternatively, perhaps the inventory was built up but not much was sold yet. Given the data, I'll stick with the first method (average inventory).\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio indicates the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,146,127.58\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{5,515,978.61}{16,146,127.58} \\approx 0.342 \\]\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to meet short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 2,882,590.91\n- Bank Deposits = 2,698,390.00\n- Interest Receivable = 9,066.78\n- Accounts Receivable = 330,748.44\n- Total Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 2,882,590.91 + 2,698,390.00 + 9,066.78 + 330,748.44\n= 5,920,796.13\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{5,920,796.13}{5,515,978.61} \\approx 1.073 \\]\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to pay short-term obligations with current assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 13,753,616.13\n- Total Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{13,753,616.13}{5,515,978.61} \\approx 2.493 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.44', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.44', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.14', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.34', 'Quick Ratio': '1.07', 'Current Ratio': '2.49'} }\n```\n\n**Note on Inventory Turnover Ratio:**\nGiven that the initial inventory was zero and the ending is very high compared to the Cost of Goods Sold, the ratio is unusually low. This might indicate that the inventory was just built up at the end of the period with not much sold yet, or perhaps the Cost of Goods Sold is for a shorter period than the inventory buildup. For this calculation, I used average inventory (beginning + ending / 2), resulting in 0.14. If only ending inventory is used, it would be 0.07, but the first method is more standard unless beginning inventory is not meaningful.",
