                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 13,753,616.13\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 5,515,978.61\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 13,753,616.13 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ 2.49\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 2,882,590.91\n- Bank Deposits = 2,698,390.00\n- Interest Receivable = 9,066.78\n- Accounts Receivable = 330,748.44\n- Total Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 2,882,590.91 + 2,698,390.00 + 9,066.78 + 330,748.44\n= 2,882,590.91 + 2,698,390.00 = 5,580,980.91\n+ 9,066.78 = 5,590,047.69\n+ 330,748.44 = 5,920,796.13\n\nQuick Ratio = 5,920,796.13 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ 1.07\n\n*Wait a minute, is Interest Receivable considered a quick asset? I think typically it's Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable. Maybe Interest Receivable isn't always included. Let me check.*\n\nUpon checking, usually, quick assets include cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Interest receivable might not always be included unless it's expected to be received very soon. For this calculation, I'll exclude Interest Receivable to be more conservative.\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable\n= 2,882,590.91 + 2,698,390.00 + 330,748.44\n= 5,911,729.35\n\nQuick Ratio = 5,911,729.35 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ 1.07\n\n*Hmm, same result. Maybe Interest Receivable is negligible here. I'll proceed with 1.07.*\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since there are no non-current liabilities listed) = 5,515,978.61\n- Total Assets = 21,662,106.19\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 5,515,978.61 / 21,662,106.19 ≈ 0.255 or 0.26\n\n*Wait, is Total Liabilities only current liabilities here? The balance sheet shows \"Total Current Liabilities\" and no other liabilities, so yes.*\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,146,127.58\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 5,515,978.61 / 16,146,127.58 ≈ 0.34\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -2,419,019.09\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -2,419,019.09 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ -0.44\n\n*This is negative, which indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative relative to its debt, which isn't good.*\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '2.49', 'Quick Ratio': '1.07', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.26', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.34', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.44'} }\n```\n\n*Let me double-check the calculations to ensure no mistakes.*\n\n**Rechecking:**\n\n1. Current Ratio: 13,753,616.13 / 5,515,978.61 = 2.493 (≈2.49) ✅\n2. Quick Ratio: (2,882,590.91 + 2,698,390.00 + 330,748.44) / 5,515,978.61 = 5,911,729.35 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ 1.07 ✅\n3. Debt to Asset: 5,515,978.61 / 21,662,106.19 ≈ 0.255 (rounded to 0.26) ✅\n4. Debt to Equity: 5,515,978.61 / 16,146,127.58 ≈ 0.34 ✅\n5. Cash Flow to Debt: -2,419,019.09 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ -0.44 ✅\n\nEverything checks out! \n\nFinal JSON:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '2.49', 'Quick Ratio': '1.07', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.26', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.34', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.44'} }\n```",
