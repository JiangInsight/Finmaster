                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. We have three financial statements: the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement. We need to calculate three ratios:\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio**\n2. **Net Profit Margin**\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio**\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of debt financing relative to shareholders' equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities** (which seems to be the only liabilities listed) = 5,515,978.61\n- **Total Owner's Equity** = 16,146,127.58\n\nWait a minute, in the balance sheet, under liabilities, we only have \"Total Current Liabilities\" listed as 5,515,978.61. There's no mention of long-term liabilities. So, total liabilities = total current liabilities = 5,515,978.61.\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{5,515,978.61}{16,146,127.58} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n5,515,978.61 / 16,146,127.58 ≈ 0.3416\n\nSo, approximately 0.34.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net profit is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit** = 146,127.58\n- **Total Revenue** = 863,371.65\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{146,127.58}{863,371.65} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\n146,127.58 / 863,371.65 ≈ 0.16925\n\nMultiply by 100%:\n\n≈ 16.925%\n\nSo, approximately 16.93%.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to cover its current liabilities with cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities** = -2,419,019.09\n- From the balance sheet:\n  - **Total Current Liabilities** = 5,515,978.61\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-2,419,019.09}{5,515,978.61} \\]\n\n-2,419,019.09 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ -0.4385\n\nSo, approximately -0.44.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, let's present these in the required JSON format:\n\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.34\n- Net Profit Margin: 16.93%\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: -0.44\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.34', 'Net Profit Margin': '16.93%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.44'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify the calculations to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio**:\n   - 5,515,978.61 / 16,146,127.58 ≈ 0.3416 ✔\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin**:\n   - 146,127.58 / 863,371.65 ≈ 0.16925 → 16.925% ✔\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio**:\n   - -2,419,019.09 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ -0.4385 ✔\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Debt to Equity Ratio**: A ratio of 0.34 means the company has $0.34 in debt for every $1 of equity, indicating moderate leverage.\n  \n- **Net Profit Margin**: 16.93% is a healthy profit margin, indicating that the company retains about 17 cents from each dollar of revenue as profit.\n  \n- **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio**: -0.44 is concerning because it means the company's operating cash flow is negative and cannot cover current liabilities, suggesting potential liquidity issues.\n\nThese insights can help assess the company's financial health. The positive net profit margin is good, but the negative operating cash flow relative to current liabilities is a red flag that warrants further investigation into why cash flow is negative despite profitability (possibly due to heavy investments in inventory or receivables).",
