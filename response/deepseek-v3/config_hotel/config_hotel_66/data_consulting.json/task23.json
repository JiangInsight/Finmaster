                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate two key ratios: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows how much gross profit a company makes from its sales. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   It's expressed as a percentage.\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: This ratio indicates a company's ability to cover its debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   Here, \"Total Debt\" can be considered as the \"Total Current Liabilities\" from the balance sheet since that's the immediate debt the company has.\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the provided financial statements:\n\n**Income Statement:**\n- Total Revenue: \\$863,371.65\n- Gross Profit: \\$300,421.65\n\n**Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$2,419,019.09\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Liabilities: \\$5,515,978.61\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{300,421.65}{863,371.65} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[\n\\frac{300,421.65}{863,371.65} \\approx 0.348\n\\]\n\\[\n0.348 \\times 100 = 34.8\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **34.80%**.\n\n### Calculating Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-2,419,019.09}{5,515,978.61}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\n\\frac{-2,419,019.09}{5,515,978.61} \\approx -0.4385\n\\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-0.44**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit: \\$300,421.65\n   - Total Revenue: \\$863,371.65\n   - 300,421.65 / 863,371.65 ≈ 0.348 → 34.8% ✔\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -\\$2,419,019.09\n   - Total Current Liabilities: \\$5,515,978.61\n   - -2,419,019.09 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ -0.44 ✔\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '34.80%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.44'}}\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin (34.80%)**: This is quite healthy, indicating that the company retains a good portion of revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold.\n  \n- **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio (-0.44)**: A negative ratio suggests that the company's operating cash flow is negative, meaning it's not generating enough cash from operations to cover its current liabilities. This could be a concern unless it's a temporary situation or the company has other sources of funding.\n\nThe example provided had a negative Cash Flow to Debt Ratio as well (-3.90), which was more severe than this case. It seems the company in the problem is also experiencing negative operating cash flow relative to its debt, though to a lesser extent.",
