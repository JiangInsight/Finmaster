                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through them step by step, explaining how to calculate each one based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -2,419,019.09\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n\nCalculation:\n- -2,419,019.09 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ -0.44\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Liabilities / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61 (this seems to be the only liability)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 16,146,127.58\n\nCalculation:\n- 5,515,978.61 / 16,146,127.58 ≈ 0.34\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets  \n(Since we only have end amounts, we'll use Total Assets at the end)\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 863,371.65\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets = 21,662,106.19\n\nCalculation:\n- 863,371.65 / 21,662,106.19 ≈ 0.04\n\n*Wait a minute, this seems very low compared to the example. Maybe I should use average total assets if possible. But initial total assets are 16,000,000 and end is 21,662,106.19, so average is (16,000,000 + 21,662,106.19)/2 = 18,831,053.10*\n\nRecalculating:\n- 863,371.65 / 18,831,053.10 ≈ 0.046 (still around 0.05)\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 13,753,616.13\n- Inventory = 7,832,820.00\n- Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n\nCalculation:\n- (13,753,616.13 - 7,832,820.00) / 5,515,978.61\n- = 5,920,796.13 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ 1.07\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n(This seems the same as the first ratio. Maybe it's a different interpretation, but based on the example, both had the same value.)\n\nSo:\n- Same as first ratio: -0.44\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Income / Average Shareholder's Equity  \n(Using end equity since initial was 16,000,000 and end is 16,146,127.58, average is ~16,073,063.79)\n\nFrom income statement:\n- Net Profit = 146,127.58\n\nCalculation:\n- 146,127.58 / 16,073,063.79 ≈ 0.009 or 0.9%\n\n*But in the example, it was given as a percentage, so maybe just Net Income / End Equity:*\n- 146,127.58 / 16,146,127.58 ≈ 0.009 or 0.9%\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable  \n(Assuming all sales are credit sales since we don't have info, and initial AR was 0, end is 330,748.44, so average is ~165,374.22)\n\nFrom income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 863,371.65\n\nCalculation:\n- 863,371.65 / 165,374.22 ≈ 5.22\n\n*But initial AR was 0, so maybe just use end AR:*\n- 863,371.65 / 330,748.44 ≈ 2.61\n\nGiven the example used initial and end, maybe average is better, so 5.22.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter calculating all these, here's the compiled solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.44', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.34', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.05', 'Quick Ratio': '1.07', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.44', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.90%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '5.22'}}\n```\n\n*Wait, comparing with the example, some ratios seem off, like Total Asset Turnover is much lower here (0.05 vs 0.41 in example), maybe because revenue is much lower relative to assets in this case. Similarly, ROE is positive here but negative in the example, which makes sense given the net profit is positive here.*\n\nLet me double-check the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:\n\nInitial AR: 0  \nEnd AR: 330,748.44  \nAverage AR: (0 + 330,748.44)/2 = 165,374.22  \nNet Sales: 863,371.65  \nRatio: 863,371.65 / 165,374.22 ≈ 5.22\n\nThis seems correct. Similarly, other ratios seem correctly calculated based on the given data.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.44', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.34', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.05', 'Quick Ratio': '1.07', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.44', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.90%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '5.22'}}\n```",
