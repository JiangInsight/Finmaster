                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: Return on Equity (ROE), Debt to Asset Ratio, and Gross Profit Margin.\n\n### 1. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Definition:** ROE measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Shareholder's Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Profit (from Income Statement) = 146,127.58\n- Shareholder's Equity at the end (from Balance Sheet) = 16,146,127.58\n- Shareholder's Equity at the beginning (assuming initial is the same as paid-in capital since retained earnings were 0) = 16,000,000.00\n\n**Average Shareholder's Equity:**\n\\[ \\text{Average Equity} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Equity} + \\text{Ending Equity}}{2} = \\frac{16,000,000 + 16,146,127.58}{2} = \\frac{32,146,127.58}{2} = 16,073,063.79 \\]\n\n**Calculating ROE:**\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{146,127.58}{16,073,063.79} \\times 100 \\approx 0.909 \\times 100 \\approx 0.91\\% \\]\n\n*Wait a minute*, the initial example had a negative ROE because the net profit was negative. Here, net profit is positive, so ROE is positive but quite low.\n\n### 2. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio indicates the proportion of a company's assets that are financed through debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Total Liabilities (from Balance Sheet) = Total Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n- Total Assets = 21,662,106.19\n\n**Calculating Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{5,515,978.61}{21,662,106.19} \\approx 0.2546 \\]\n\nSo, approximately 0.25.\n\n### 3. Gross Profit Margin\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Gross Profit (from Income Statement) = 300,421.65\n- Total Revenue = 863,371.65\n\n**Calculating Gross Profit Margin:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{300,421.65}{863,371.65} \\times 100 \\approx 0.348 \\times 100 \\approx 34.8\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying Calculations\nLet me double-check each calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **ROE:**\n   - Net Profit: 146,127.58\n   - Average Equity: (16,000,000 + 16,146,127.58)/2 = 16,073,063.79\n   - 146,127.58 / 16,073,063.79 ≈ 0.00909 → 0.91%\n\n2. **Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n   - Total Liabilities: 5,515,978.61\n   - Total Assets: 21,662,106.19\n   - 5,515,978.61 / 21,662,106.19 ≈ 0.2546 → 0.25\n\n3. **Gross Profit Margin:**\n   - Gross Profit: 300,421.65\n   - Total Revenue: 863,371.65\n   - 300,421.65 / 863,371.65 ≈ 0.348 → 34.8%\n\nAll calculations seem correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.91%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.25', 'Gross Profit Margin': '34.80%'} }\n```",
