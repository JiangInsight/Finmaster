                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate two ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Asset Ratio and the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 5,515,978.61\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n- **Total Assets (End_amount):** 21,662,106.19\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{5,515,978.61}{21,662,106.19} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5,515,978.61}{21,662,106.19} \\approx 0.2546 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.25\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the ratio was given to two decimal places as a string, so we'll represent it similarly.\n\n**Debt to Asset Ratio:** '0.25'\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operations to the net income, indicating how much cash is generated per dollar of net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -2,419,019.09\n- **Net Profit (from Income Statement):** 146,127.58\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-2,419,019.09}{146,127.58} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-2,419,019.09}{146,127.58} \\approx -16.553 \\]\n\nThis negative value indicates that the operating cash flow is negative while net income is positive, which might suggest that despite reporting a profit, the company is burning cash in operations, possibly due to increases in working capital (like inventory or receivables).\n\nHowever, in the example provided, the ratio was positive (4.41), suggesting that absolute values might be considered or perhaps the signs are handled differently. But based on the standard calculation, we have a negative ratio here.\n\nBut since the example had a positive ratio where both values were negative (Net Profit: -1,645,141.43 and Operating Cash Flow: -7,259,994.10), dividing two negatives gives a positive. Here, one is negative and one is positive, so the ratio is negative.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio is -16.55 when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculation to ensure no mistakes.\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -2,419,019.09  \nNet Profit: 146,127.58\n\n\\[ -2,419,019.09 / 146,127.58 \\approx -16.55 \\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHowever, in financial analysis, sometimes absolute values are considered, or perhaps the signs are indicative of the nature of cash flows. But strictly mathematically, the ratio is -16.55.\n\nBut looking back at the example:\n\nNet Profit: -1,645,141.43  \nOperating Cash Flow: -7,259,994.10  \nRatio: -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 = 4.41 (positive because negative divided by negative)\n\nIn our case, negative divided by positive is negative.\n\nSo, the ratio is -16.55.\n\nBut perhaps the ratio is typically expressed as a positive value, indicating the magnitude, and the direction is understood from context. Alternatively, maybe the operating cash flow is taken as absolute.\n\nBut based on the standard formula, it's -16.55.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is:\n\n|Operating Cash Flow| / |Net Income|\n\nThen:\n\n| -2,419,019.09 | / | 146,127.58 | = 2,419,019.09 / 146,127.58 ≈ 16.55\n\nThis makes sense because the ratio is about how much cash is generated relative to income, regardless of direction.\n\nGiven that in the example, both were negative, and the ratio was positive, it's likely that absolute values are used.\n\nSo, recalculating with absolute values:\n\nOperating Cash Flow: 2,419,019.09  \nNet Income: 146,127.58  \nRatio: 2,419,019.09 / 146,127.58 ≈ 16.55\n\n**Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:** '16.55'\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.25', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '16.55'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me quickly verify the numbers to ensure no typos:\n\nFrom Balance Sheet:\n- Total Liabilities: 5,515,978.61\n- Total Assets: 21,662,106.19\n- Ratio: 5,515,978.61 / 21,662,106.19 ≈ 0.2546 → '0.25'\n\nFrom Cash Flow and Income Statement:\n- Operating Cash Flow: -2,419,019.09 → absolute: 2,419,019.09\n- Net Income: 146,127.58\n- Ratio: 2,419,019.09 / 146,127.58 ≈ 16.55\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n**Final Json:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.25', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '16.55'}}\n```",
