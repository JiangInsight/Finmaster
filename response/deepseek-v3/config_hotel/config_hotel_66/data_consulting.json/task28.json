                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Asset Ratio, the Gross Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. \n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 5,515,978.61\n- **Total Non-current Liabilities:** Not provided explicitly, but looking at the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are under \"Total Current Liabilities.\" There's no mention of long-term debt or other non-current liabilities. So, we'll assume Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n- **Total Assets (End_amount):** 21,662,106.19\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{5,515,978.61}{21,662,106.19} \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{5,515,978.61}{21,662,106.19} \\approx 0.2546 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.25\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 300,421.65\n- **Total Revenue:** 863,371.65\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{300,421.65}{863,371.65} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's calculate:\n\\[ \\frac{300,421.65}{863,371.65} \\approx 0.348 \\]\n\\[ 0.348 \\times 100 = 34.8\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -2,419,019.09 (negative value)\n- **Current Liabilities (from balance sheet):** 5,515,978.61\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-2,419,019.09}{5,515,978.61} \\]\n\nLet's compute:\n\\[ \\frac{-2,419,019.09}{5,515,978.61} \\approx -0.4385 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: -0.44\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios:\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.25\n- Gross Profit Margin: 34.80%\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -0.44\n\nIn the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.25', 'Gross Profit Margin': '34.80%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.44'}}\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n   - Liabilities: 5,515,978.61\n   - Assets: 21,662,106.19\n   - 5,515,978.61 / 21,662,106.19 ≈ 0.25 ✔\n\n2. **Gross Profit Margin:**\n   - Gross Profit: 300,421.65\n   - Revenue: 863,371.65\n   - (300,421.65 / 863,371.65) * 100 ≈ 34.8% ✔\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -2,419,019.09\n   - Current Liabilities: 5,515,978.61\n   - -2,419,019.09 / 5,515,978.61 ≈ -0.44 ✔\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Debt to Asset Ratio:** Since only current liabilities are provided, and no long-term debts are mentioned, the ratio might be understated if there are other liabilities not listed. But based on the given data, it's correct.\n  \n- **Gross Profit Margin:** The calculation is straightforward with the given numbers. A 34.8% margin indicates that for every dollar of revenue, about 34.8 cents are gross profit.\n\n- **Operating Cash Flow Ratio:** A negative value indicates that the company's operating activities are not generating enough cash to cover current liabilities, which could be a concern. This means the company is using more cash in operations than it's generating, possibly relying on other sources to cover short-term obligations.\n\n### Final Answer (Reiterated)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.25', 'Gross Profit Margin': '34.80%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.44'}}\n```",
