                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Asset Ratio\n\nFirst, what is the Debt to Asset Ratio? From what I understand, it's a financial metric that shows the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nBut sometimes, \"Total Debt\" can be interpreted as \"Total Liabilities.\" Looking at the balance sheet provided, I see \"Total Current Liabilities\" and no long-term liabilities listed. So, in this case, the total debt would be the total current liabilities since that's the only debt listed.\n\n### Identifying the Numbers from the Balance Sheet\n\nFrom the problem's balance sheet:\n\n1. **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount)**: 5,515,978.61\n   - This is the sum of Accounts Payable (5,472,810.00) and Taxes Payable (43,168.61).\n   \n2. **Total Assets (End_amount)**: 21,662,106.19\n   - This is given directly in the \"Total Assets\" row.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{5,515,978.61}{21,662,106.19} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5,515,978.61}{21,662,106.19} \\approx 0.2546 \\]\n\nRounding this to two decimal places gives us approximately 0.25.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example to ensure I'm doing this correctly:\n\n- Example's Total Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\n- Example's Total Assets: 13,216,409.49\n- Calculated Ratio: 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 â‰ˆ 0.1409, which matches the given solution of '0.14'.\n\nSo, my method seems correct.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nFor our problem:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5,515,978.61}{21,662,106.19} \\approx 0.2546 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.25\n\n### Potential Missteps\n\nInitially, I wondered if \"Total Debt\" includes only interest-bearing liabilities, but in this context, accounts payable and taxes payable are both forms of debt the company owes, even if not interest-bearing in the traditional sense. Since the example includes all current liabilities in the calculation, it's appropriate to do the same here.\n\nAlso, I considered if there might be long-term liabilities not listed, but the balance sheet doesn't show any, so we can assume total debt is just the current liabilities.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.25'} }\n```",
