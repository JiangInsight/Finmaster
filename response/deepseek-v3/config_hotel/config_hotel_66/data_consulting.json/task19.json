                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Current Ratio and the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: This measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its current assets. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: This shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet** (as of 2024-02-01):\n\n- **Total Current Assets**: 13,753,616.13\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 5,515,978.61\n- **Inventory (Ending)**: 7,832,820.00\n  - Note: The initial inventory (as of 2023-12-31) is 0.00.\n\nFrom the **income statement** (for the period ending 2024-02-01):\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 562,950.00\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{13,753,616.13}{5,515,978.61}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{13,753,616.13}{5,515,978.61} \\approx 2.493\n\\]\n\nSo, the Current Ratio is approximately **2.49**.\n\n### Calculating the Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\nFirst, find the Average Inventory:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2} = \\frac{0 + 7,832,820.00}{2} = 3,916,410.00\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} = \\frac{562,950.00}{3,916,410.00}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{562,950.00}{3,916,410.00} \\approx 0.1437\n\\]\n\nSo, the Inventory Turnover Ratio is approximately **0.14**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nWait a minute, the Inventory Turnover Ratio seems quite low (0.14). This would imply that the inventory is turning over very slowly, which might not make sense unless the company has a very high inventory relative to its sales. \n\nLet me double-check the numbers:\n\n- COGS: 562,950.00\n- Average Inventory: 3,916,410.00\n- Ratio: 562,950 / 3,916,410 ≈ 0.1437\n\nThe calculation seems correct based on the numbers provided. However, this low ratio suggests that the company is holding a lot of inventory compared to its cost of goods sold, which might be unusual unless it's a business with very slow-moving inventory.\n\nAlternatively, is there a possibility that the \"Initial_amount\" for Inventory is not zero? The balance sheet shows Inventory's Initial_amount as 0.00, which might imply that the company didn't have inventory at the start, which could skew the average. \n\nIf we consider that the company started with no inventory and ended with 7,832,820, using the ending inventory as the average might be more appropriate in this case (since beginning was zero). \n\nBut the standard formula uses average inventory, so unless there's a specific reason to deviate, we should stick with the average.\n\nGiven that, the ratio is indeed approximately 0.14.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating:\n\n- **Current Ratio**: 2.49\n- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: 0.14\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided in the task, the Inventory Turnover Ratio was calculated as 1.73, which is much higher than our calculation. This discrepancy might be due to how the average inventory is being considered. \n\nIn the example:\n\n- COGS: 4,410,000\n- Beginning Inventory: 0\n- Ending Inventory: 5,090,000\n- Average Inventory: (0 + 5,090,000)/2 = 2,545,000\n- Inventory Turnover: 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73\n\nSimilarly, in our problem:\n\n- COGS: 562,950\n- Beginning Inventory: 0\n- Ending Inventory: 7,832,820\n- Average Inventory: (0 + 7,832,820)/2 = 3,916,410\n- Inventory Turnover: 562,950 / 3,916,410 ≈ 0.14\n\nThe difference is that in our problem, COGS is much lower relative to the ending inventory compared to the example. \n\nGiven that, unless there's an error in interpreting the numbers, the calculation stands as is.\n\nTherefore, the final ratios are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '2.49', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.14'} }\n```",
