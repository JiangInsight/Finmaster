These typically include:\n   - Cash on Hand\n   - Bank Deposits\n   - Interest Receivable\n   - Accounts Receivable\n   (Inventory is excluded because it is not as liquid.)\n\n2. **Identify Current Liabilities**: These are liabilities that are due within one year. In this case, they are:\n   - Accounts Payable\n   - Taxes Payable\n   - Total Current Liabilities (which is the sum of the above)\n\n3. **Calculate Quick Ratio**: The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Quick Assets**:\n   - Cash on Hand: 2,882,590.91\n   - Bank Deposits: 2,698,390.00\n   - Interest Receivable: 9,066.78\n   - Accounts Receivable: 330,748.44\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Assets} = 2,882,590.91 + 2,698,390.00 + 9,066.78 + 330,748.44 = 5,920,796.13\n   \\]\n\n2. **Current Liabilities**:\n   - Total Current Liabilities: 5,515,978.61\n\n3. **Quick Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{5,920,796.13}{5,515,978.61} \\approx 1.07\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '1.07'} }\n```",
