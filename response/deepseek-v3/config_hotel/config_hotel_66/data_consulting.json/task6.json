I'm trying to calculate the Net Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Net Profit Margin\nFirst, I need to recall what the Net Profit Margin is. From what I remember, the Net Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows what percentage of a company's revenue is actual profit after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted. It's calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nThis will give us the margin as a percentage.\n\n### Identifying the Given Values\nLooking at the provided income statement:\n\n- **Net Profit**: 146,127.58\n- **Total Revenue**: 863,371.65\n\nThese are the two numbers I need for the calculation.\n\n### Performing the Calculation\nNow, let's plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{146,127.58}{863,371.65} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide the Net Profit by the Total Revenue:\n\n\\[ \\frac{146,127.58}{863,371.65} \\approx 0.1693 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.1693 \\times 100 \\approx 16.93\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let's double-check:\n\n- 146,127.58 / 863,371.65 ≈ 0.1693\n- 0.1693 * 100 = 16.93%\n\nThat checks out.\n\n### Considering the Example\nLooking back at the example provided:\n\n- Net Profit: -1,645,141.43\n- Total Revenue: 5,431,018.59\n- Calculation: (-1,645,141.43 / 5,431,018.59) * 100 ≈ -30.29%\n\nThis matches the given solution, so my approach seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter performing the calculation, the Net Profit Margin is approximately 16.93%.\n\nHere's the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '16.93%'}}\n```",
