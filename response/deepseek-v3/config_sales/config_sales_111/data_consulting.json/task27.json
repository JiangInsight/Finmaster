                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. We have three financial statements: the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement. We need to calculate three ratios:\n\n1. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio**\n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio**\n3. **Quick Ratio**\n\nLet's go through each one.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 803,237.11\n- Net Profit (from income statement) = 1,105,265.77\n\nWait a minute, the Net Profit is positive here (1,105,265.77), but the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is 803,237.11. \n\nCalculating:\n\\[ \\frac{803,237.11}{1,105,265.77} \\approx 0.727 \\]\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the ratio was higher when the net profit was negative, which makes sense because dividing a negative by a negative gives a positive. Here, both are positive, so the ratio is less than 1, indicating that the operating cash flow is less than the net income.\n\nWait, is this correct? Let me double-check the formula. \n\nActually, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is indeed Net Cash Flow from Operating divided by Net Income. So, 803,237.11 / 1,105,265.77 ≈ 0.727.\n\nBut in the example, it was Net Cash Flow from Operating was -7,259,994.10 and Net Profit was -1,645,141.43, giving 4.41 (since -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41).\n\nSo, similarly here, it's positive divided by positive, so 0.727.\n\nBut let's express it to two decimal places: 0.73.\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need Average Current Assets, which is:\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Current Assets} + \\text{Ending Current Assets}}{2} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Current Assets (Beginning) = 8,000,000.00\n- End Current Assets = 10,261,562.67\n\nAverage Current Assets:\n\\[ \\frac{8,000,000 + 10,261,562.67}{2} = \\frac{18,261,562.67}{2} = 9,130,781.335 \\]\n\nTotal Revenue from income statement = 5,760,023.09\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\\[ \\frac{5,760,023.09}{9,130,781.335} \\approx 0.6307 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.63.\n\n### 3. Quick Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nQuick Assets are Current Assets minus Inventory and Prepaid Expenses (if any). Here, from the balance sheet, Current Assets include:\n- Cash on Hand\n- Bank Deposits\n- Interest Receivable\n- Accounts Receivable\n- Inventory\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 4,863,237.11 (Cash on Hand) + 3,502,535.57 (Bank Deposits) + 11,346.19 (Interest Receivable) + 1,454,443.80 (Accounts Receivable)\n= 4,863,237.11 + 3,502,535.57 = 8,365,772.68\n+ 11,346.19 = 8,377,118.87\n+ 1,454,443.80 = 9,831,562.67\n\nWait, let's add them step by step to avoid mistakes:\n4,863,237.11 (Cash)\n+ 3,502,535.57 (Bank)\n= 8,365,772.68\n+ 11,346.19 (Interest Receivable)\n= 8,377,118.87\n+ 1,454,443.80 (Accounts Receivable)\n= 9,831,562.67\n\nCurrent Liabilities from balance sheet = 1,548,001.20\n\nNow, Quick Ratio:\n\\[ \\frac{9,831,562.67}{1,548,001.20} \\approx 6.35 \\]\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check the components again.\n\nWait, the Total Current Assets is 10,261,562.67, and Inventory is 430,000. So Quick Assets should be Total Current Assets - Inventory = 10,261,562.67 - 430,000 = 9,831,562.67.\n\nYes, that matches our addition. So Quick Ratio is indeed 9,831,562.67 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 6.35.\n\nBut in the example, the Quick Ratio was 1.54, which is more typical. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the example, Quick Assets were:\nCash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 270,005.90 + 164,645.57 + 2,672.87 + 2,429,482.13\n= 270,005.90 + 164,645.57 = 434,651.47\n+ 2,672.87 = 437,324.34\n+ 2,429,482.13 = 2,866,806.47\n\nCurrent Liabilities = 1,861,550.92\nQuick Ratio = 2,866,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54\n\nSimilarly here, our calculation seems correct. Maybe this company has a very high quick ratio due to large cash holdings.\n\nSo, Quick Ratio = 6.35.\n\nBut let me cross-check the numbers:\n\nFrom balance sheet:\nCash on Hand: 4,863,237.11\nBank Deposits: 3,502,535.57\nInterest Receivable: 11,346.19\nAccounts Receivable: 1,454,443.80\nInventory: 430,000.00\n\nQuick Assets = Cash + Bank + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 4,863,237.11 + 3,502,535.57 + 11,346.19 + 1,454,443.80\n= (4,863,237.11 + 3,502,535.57) = 8,365,772.68\n+ 11,346.19 = 8,377,118.87\n+ 1,454,443.80 = 9,831,562.67\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 1,548,001.20\n\nQuick Ratio = 9,831,562.67 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 6.35\n\nYes, seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '0.73', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.63', 'Quick Ratio': '6.35'}}\n```\n\nHowever, the Quick Ratio seems unusually high. Maybe the company has very low current liabilities compared to its liquid assets. Alternatively, perhaps \"Bank Deposits\" are not considered as liquid in this context, but typically they are. \n\nGiven the data, the calculations seem correct, so the answer is as above.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '0.73', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.63', 'Quick Ratio': '6.35'}}\n```",
