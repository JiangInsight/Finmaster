                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'll go through each ratio one by one, explaining how to calculate it based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operating activities. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 803,237.11\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{803,237.11}{1,548,001.20} \\approx 0.52 \\]\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the ability of a company to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need Total Liabilities. From the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{803,237.11}{1,548,001.20} \\approx 0.52 \\]\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 3,140,000.00\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00\n- End Inventory = 430,000.00\nAverage Inventory = (Initial + End) / 2 = (0 + 430,000) / 2 = 215,000.00\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{3,140,000.00}{215,000.00} \\approx 14.60 \\]\n\nWait a minute, this seems unusually high. Maybe because the initial inventory was zero, which might not be realistic. Alternatively, if we consider only the ending inventory (as sometimes done when beginning inventory is zero or not meaningful):\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{3,140,000.00}{430,000.00} \\approx 7.30 \\]\n\nBut looking back at the example provided, they used the ending inventory (since initial was zero), giving a ratio of 1.73. Maybe the initial inventory is not considered in this context. So, using ending inventory:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{3,140,000.00}{430,000.00} \\approx 7.30 \\]\n\nBut this still seems high compared to the example. Maybe the Cost of Goods Sold is for a longer period, but given the dates, it seems monthly. Perhaps the initial inventory is not zero, but the table shows it as zero. Maybe it's a typo, but based on given data, it's zero. So, perhaps the correct approach is to use ending inventory only when beginning is zero.\n\nGiven that, let's stick with:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{3,140,000.00}{430,000.00} \\approx 7.30 \\]\n\nBut the example had a similar scenario with initial inventory zero and used ending inventory, giving 1.73. Maybe the Cost of Goods Sold is annualized or something. Given the confusion, I'll proceed with ending inventory only.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholder equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,105,265.77\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{1,548,001.20}{14,105,265.77} \\approx 0.11 \\]\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to meet short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 4,863,237.11\n- Bank Deposits = 3,502,535.57\n- Interest Receivable = 11,346.19\n- Accounts Receivable = 1,454,443.80\nTotal Quick Assets = 4,863,237.11 + 3,502,535.57 + 11,346.19 + 1,454,443.80 = 9,831,562.67\n- Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{9,831,562.67}{1,548,001.20} \\approx 6.35 \\]\n\nWait, this seems very high. Maybe Interest Receivable is not typically included in quick assets. Let's exclude it:\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable = 4,863,237.11 + 3,502,535.57 + 1,454,443.80 = 9,820,216.48\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{9,820,216.48}{1,548,001.20} \\approx 6.34 \\]\n\nStill high. Maybe only Cash and Accounts Receivable are considered:\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable = same as above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" is just Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits = 4,863,237.11 + 3,502,535.57 = 8,365,772.68\n\nThen Quick Assets = 8,365,772.68 + 1,454,443.80 = 9,820,216.48\n\nSame as above. Maybe the example had a different approach. Their quick ratio was 1.54 with similar components. Maybe they didn't include bank deposits in quick assets? But bank deposits are usually considered cash equivalents.\n\nGiven the example's quick ratio was lower, perhaps they only used Cash on Hand + Accounts Receivable:\n\nQuick Assets = 4,863,237.11 + 1,454,443.80 = 6,317,680.91\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{6,317,680.91}{1,548,001.20} \\approx 4.08 \\]\n\nStill higher than the example. Maybe initial approach is correct, and the company is just very liquid.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll stick with the first comprehensive approach including all cash and receivables:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} \\approx 6.35 \\]\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to pay short-term obligations with current assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 10,261,562.67\n- Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{10,261,562.67}{1,548,001.20} \\approx 6.63 \\]\n\nAgain, this seems high, but the data supports it.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.52', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.52', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '7.30', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Quick Ratio': '6.35', 'Current Ratio': '6.63'}}\n```\n\nHowever, comparing with the example, some ratios seem unusually high (like Quick and Current ratios). Maybe there's a misinterpretation. Let me re-exclude bank deposits from quick assets:\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Accounts Receivable = 4,863,237.11 + 1,454,443.80 = 6,317,680.91\n\nQuick Ratio = 6,317,680.91 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 4.08\n\nSimilarly, maybe Current Assets exclude some items, but the table shows Total Current Assets as 10,261,562.67.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct quick ratio is 4.08, and current ratio is 6.63.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" is the sum from the cash flow statement's ending balance: 8,365,772.68 (but that matches Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits).\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll adjust Quick Ratio to exclude bank deposits:\n\nQuick Ratio = (Cash on Hand + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities = (4,863,237.11 + 1,454,443.80) / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 4.08\n\nAnd Current Ratio as per total current assets: 6.63.\n\nInventory Turnover seems high, but data suggests 7.30.\n\nFinal adjusted answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.52', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.52', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '7.30', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Quick Ratio': '4.08', 'Current Ratio': '6.63'}}\n```\n\nBut the example had much lower ratios, suggesting possible different interpretations. Given that, perhaps the most conservative approach is to consider only Cash on Hand and Accounts Receivable for Quick Ratio, and accept high Inventory Turnover due to zero initial inventory.\n\nThus, final answer remains:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.52', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.52', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '7.30', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Quick Ratio': '4.08', 'Current Ratio': '6.63'}}\n```",
