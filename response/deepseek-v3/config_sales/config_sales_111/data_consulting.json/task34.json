                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'll go through each ratio one by one, explaining how I calculate it based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 803,237.11\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n\nCalculation:\n803,237.11 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 0.519\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20 (since no long-term liabilities are listed)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,105,265.77\n\nCalculation:\n1,548,001.20 / 14,105,265.77 ≈ 0.11\n\n*Note:* If we consider only the current liabilities as total debt (since no other liabilities are provided), the ratio is 0.11. However, sometimes \"debt\" refers to interest-bearing liabilities, but here all current liabilities seem to be payables, not necessarily debt. But based on the example, it seems to use total current liabilities as debt, so we'll proceed with that.\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 5,760,023.09\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets = 15,653,266.97\n- Average Total Assets = (13,000,000 + 15,653,266.97) / 2 = 14,326,633.485\n\nCalculation:\n5,760,023.09 / 14,326,633.485 ≈ 0.402\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 10,261,562.67\n- Inventory = 430,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n\nCalculation:\n(10,261,562.67 - 430,000) / 1,548,001.20 = 9,831,562.67 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 6.35\n\n*Wait a minute, this seems too high compared to the example. Maybe I missed something. Let me check the components of current assets:*\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 4,863,237.11\n- Bank Deposits = 3,502,535.57\n- Interest Receivable = 11,346.19\n- Accounts Receivable = 1,454,443.80\n- Inventory = 430,000.00\nTotal Current Assets = sum of above = 10,261,562.67\n\nQuick assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 10,261,562.67 - 430,000 = 9,831,562.67\nQuick Ratio = 9,831,562.67 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 6.35\n\nThis seems correct based on the data. Maybe the company has a lot of liquid assets compared to liabilities.\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nThis is the same as the first ratio, Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\nFrom earlier:\n803,237.11 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 0.519\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Income / Average Shareholder's Equity\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = 1,105,265.77\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Owner's Equity = 13,000,000.00\n- End Owner's Equity = 14,105,265.77\n- Average Equity = (13,000,000 + 14,105,265.77) / 2 = 13,552,632.885\n\nCalculation:\n1,105,265.77 / 13,552,632.885 ≈ 0.0816 or 8.16%\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since no info on cash sales):\n- Net Sales = 5,760,023.09\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00\n- End Accounts Receivable = 1,454,443.80\n- Average AR = (0 + 1,454,443.80) / 2 = 727,221.90\n\nCalculation:\n5,760,023.09 / 727,221.90 ≈ 7.92\n\n*But in the example, it seems they might have used end AR instead of average. Let me check both ways:*\n\nUsing average:\n5,760,023.09 / 727,221.90 ≈ 7.92\n\nUsing end AR:\n5,760,023.09 / 1,454,443.80 ≈ 3.96\n\nThe example used average, so we'll go with 7.92.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.52', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.40', 'Quick Ratio': '6.35', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.52', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '8.16%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.92'}}\n```\n\n*Wait, comparing with the example, some ratios seem off in magnitude (like quick ratio being 6.35 vs. 1.54 in the example). Maybe I misapplied something. Let me recheck quick ratio components.*\n\nLooking back, quick assets are cash + marketable securities + accounts receivable. Maybe \"Bank Deposits\" are not considered quick assets? But usually, bank deposits are part of cash equivalents. Alternatively, maybe only cash on hand and accounts receivable are quick assets, excluding bank deposits and interest receivable.\n\nIf we define quick assets as:\nCash on Hand + Accounts Receivable = 4,863,237.11 + 1,454,443.80 = 6,317,680.91\nThen Quick Ratio = 6,317,680.91 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 4.08\n\nStill higher than the example. Maybe only cash and accounts receivable, excluding interest receivable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Bank Deposits\" are not immediately available, but that's unusual. Given the data, it's likely that all current assets except inventory are quick. Maybe the example had a different interpretation.\n\nGiven that, I think the initial calculation is correct based on standard definitions. Perhaps the company indeed has a very high quick ratio due to large cash holdings.\n\nSimilarly, for Debt to Equity, if we consider only interest-bearing debt, but none is listed, it might be 0, but the example used current liabilities. So 0.11 seems correct.\n\nThus, the final answer stands as above.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.52', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.40', 'Quick Ratio': '6.35', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.52', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '8.16%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.92'}}\n```",
