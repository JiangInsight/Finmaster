                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Net Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Net Profit Margin\nFirst, I recall that the Net Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows what percentage of a company's revenue is actual profit after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nSo, to find the Net Profit Margin, I need two numbers:\n1. Net Profit\n2. Total Revenue\n\n### Identifying the Numbers from the Given Data\nLooking at the provided income statement:\n\n1. **Total Revenue**: This is given as 5,760,023.09.\n2. **Net Profit**: This is given as 1,105,265.77.\n\n### Calculating the Net Profit Margin\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,105,265.77}{5,760,023.09} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,105,265.77}{5,760,023.09} \\approx 0.1919 \\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.1919 \\times 100 \\approx 19.19\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let's double-check:\n\n- 5,760,023.09 * 0.1919 â‰ˆ 1,105,265.77 (which matches the Net Profit)\n  \nYes, the calculation seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is approximately 19.19%.\n\n### Presenting the Answer in the Required Format\nThe solution should be presented in JSON format as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '19.19%'} }\n```\n\n### Additional Observations\nLooking at the example provided where the Net Profit was negative, the Net Profit Margin was also negative (-30.29%), which makes sense because if the company is losing money, the margin reflects that. In our case, the company is profitable, so the margin is positive.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter carefully going through the numbers and performing the calculations, the Net Profit Margin for the given income statement is **19.19%**. \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '19.19%'} }\n```",
