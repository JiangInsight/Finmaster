                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: Debt to Equity Ratio, Net Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of debt financing relative to shareholders' equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 1,548,001.20\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 14,105,265.77\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{1,548,001.20}{14,105,265.77} \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{1,548,001.20}{14,105,265.77} \\approx 0.1097 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[ \\approx 0.11 \\]\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net profit is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** 1,105,265.77\n- **Total Revenue:** 5,760,023.09\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,105,265.77}{5,760,023.09} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's compute:\n\\[ \\frac{1,105,265.77}{5,760,023.09} \\approx 0.1919 \\]\n\\[ 0.1919 \\times 100 \\approx 19.19\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** 803,237.11\n- From the balance sheet:\n  - **Total Current Liabilities:** 1,548,001.20\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{803,237.11}{1,548,001.20} \\]\n\nLet's calculate:\n\\[ \\frac{803,237.11}{1,548,001.20} \\approx 0.5189 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[ \\approx 0.52 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Net Profit Margin': '19.19%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.52'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - Liabilities: 1,548,001.20\n   - Equity: 14,105,265.77\n   - 1,548,001.20 / 14,105,265.77 ≈ 0.11 ✔\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - Net Profit: 1,105,265.77\n   - Revenue: 5,760,023.09\n   - (1,105,265.77 / 5,760,023.09) * 100 ≈ 19.19% ✔\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: 803,237.11\n   - Current Liabilities: 1,548,001.20\n   - 803,237.11 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 0.52 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The ratios are correctly calculated based on the provided financial statements.",
