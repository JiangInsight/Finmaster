                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the four requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities listed) = 1,548,001.20\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,105,265.77\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 1,548,001.20 / 14,105,265.77 ≈ 0.1097\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:**  \nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1,105,265.77\n- Total Revenue = 5,760,023.09\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (1,105,265.77 / 5,760,023.09) * 100 ≈ 19.19%\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:**  \nROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets = 15,653,266.97\n- Net Profit = 1,105,265.77\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (1,105,265.77 / 15,653,266.97) * 100 ≈ 7.06%\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since no info on cash sales is given), Net Credit Sales = Total Revenue = 5,760,023.09\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable:\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- End_amount for Accounts Receivable = 1,454,443.80\n- Initial_amount for Accounts Receivable = 0.00\nAverage = (0 + 1,454,443.80) / 2 = 727,221.90\n\nCalculation:\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 5,760,023.09 / 727,221.90 ≈ 7.92\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Net Profit Margin': '19.19%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '7.06%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.92'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check each calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - 1,548,001.20 / 14,105,265.77 ≈ 0.1097 → \"0.11\" seems correct.\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - 1,105,265.77 / 5,760,023.09 ≈ 0.1919 → 19.19% correct.\n\n3. **ROA:**\n   - 1,105,265.77 / 15,653,266.97 ≈ 0.0706 → 7.06% correct.\n\n4. **Accounts Receivable Turnover:**\n   - 5,760,023.09 / 727,221.90 ≈ 7.92 correct (assuming beginning AR is 0).\n\nEverything checks out! The ratios are calculated correctly based on the provided data.",
