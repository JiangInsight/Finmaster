                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand where each number comes from.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all sales are credit sales) = Main Business Revenue = 5,760,023.09\n- Accounts Receivable at the end = 1,454,443.80\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00 (since it's the first period, we might assume no beginning balance)\n\n**Average Accounts Receivable:**\n\\[ \\text{Average AR} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning AR} + \\text{Ending AR}}{2} = \\frac{0 + 1,454,443.80}{2} = 727,221.90 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{AR Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5,760,023.09}{727,221.90} \\approx 7.92 \\]\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 803,237.11\n- Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{803,237.11}{1,548,001.20} \\approx 0.52 \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis seems identical to the Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the example provided. Both ratios use the same inputs. So:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = 0.52 \\]\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Sales}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Sales = Total Revenue = 5,760,023.09\n- Total Assets at the end = 15,653,266.97\n- Initial Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n\n**Average Total Assets:**\n\\[ \\text{Average TA} = \\frac{13,000,000.00 + 15,653,266.97}{2} = \\frac{28,653,266.97}{2} = 14,326,633.485 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5,760,023.09}{14,326,633.485} \\approx 0.40 \\]\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20 (assuming no long-term liabilities)\n- Total Shareholders' Equity = 14,105,265.77\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{1,548,001.20}{14,105,265.77} \\approx 0.11 \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.92', 'operating cash flow ratio': '0.52', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.52', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.40', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11'} }\n```\n\n**Verification with Example:**\nLooking back at the example provided, the calculations seem consistent with how they derived their numbers. For instance, their Accounts Receivable Turnover was 4.47 with similar inputs, and our higher ratio makes sense because our sales are higher relative to accounts receivable. Similarly, our operating cash flow ratios are positive where theirs were negative, reflecting positive cash flow in our case. The total asset turnover is slightly lower in our case, which aligns with higher average total assets. The debt to equity is lower, indicating less debt relative to equity, which matches our data.\n\nEverything checks out!",
