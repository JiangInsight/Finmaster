                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 10,261,562.67\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 1,548,001.20\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 10,261,562.67 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 6.63\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 4,863,237.11\n- Bank Deposits = 3,502,535.57 (assuming these are like marketable securities or cash equivalents)\n- Interest Receivable = 11,346.19\n- Accounts Receivable = 1,454,443.80\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable (interest receivable is usually included in quick assets if it's short-term)\n= 4,863,237.11 + 3,502,535.57 + 1,454,443.80 = 9,820,216.48\n\nQuick Ratio = 9,820,216.48 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 6.34\n\n*Note: Some interpretations might exclude interest receivable, but it's generally a quick asset if it's short-term.*\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 1,548,001.20\n- Total Assets = 15,653,266.97\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 1,548,001.20 / 15,653,266.97 ≈ 0.10\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,105,265.77\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 1,548,001.20 / 14,105,265.77 ≈ 0.11\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 803,237.11\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = 803,237.11 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 0.52\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '6.63', 'Quick Ratio': '6.34', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.52'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check the calculations to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Current Ratio:** 10,261,562.67 / 1,548,001.20 = 6.63 (correct)\n2. **Quick Ratio:** (4,863,237.11 + 3,502,535.57 + 1,454,443.80) / 1,548,001.20 = 9,820,216.48 / 1,548,001.20 = 6.34 (correct)\n3. **Debt to Asset:** 1,548,001.20 / 15,653,266.97 = 0.10 (correct)\n4. **Debt to Equity:** 1,548,001.20 / 14,105,265.77 = 0.11 (correct)\n5. **Cash Flow to Debt:** 803,237.11 / 1,548,001.20 = 0.52 (correct)\n\nEverything checks out! The ratios are calculated correctly based on the provided financial data.",
