These typically include:\n   - Cash on Hand\n   - Bank Deposits\n   - Interest Receivable\n   - Accounts Receivable\n   (Inventory is excluded because it is not as liquid.)\n\n2. **Sum Quick Assets**:\n   - Cash on Hand: 4,863,237.11\n   - Bank Deposits: 3,502,535.57\n   - Interest Receivable: 11,346.19\n   - Accounts Receivable: 1,454,443.80\n   Total Quick Assets = 4,863,237.11 + 3,502,535.57 + 11,346.19 + 1,454,443.80 = 9,831,562.67\n\n3. **Identify Current Liabilities**: Current liabilities are obligations due within one year. These include:\n   - Accounts Payable: 1,260,000.00\n   - Taxes Payable: 288,001.20\n   Total Current Liabilities = 1,260,000.00 + 288,001.20 = 1,548,001.20\n\n4. **Calculate Quick Ratio**:\n   Quick Ratio = Total Quick Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n   Quick Ratio = 9,831,562.67 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 6.35\n\n5. **Round to Two Decimal Places**:\n   Quick Ratio ≈ 6.35\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '6.35'} }\n```",
