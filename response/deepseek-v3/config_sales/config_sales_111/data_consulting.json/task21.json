                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two things: the Free Cash Flow (FCF) and the Current Assets Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\n**1. Free Cash Flow (FCF):**\nFree Cash Flow is a measure of how much cash a company generates after accounting for capital expenditures like fixed assets. It's an important metric because it shows how much cash is available for expansion, dividends, or debt reduction.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement, FCF can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} + \\text{Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities} \\]\n\nAlternatively, sometimes it's calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = \\text{Operating Cash Flow} - \\text{Capital Expenditures} \\]\nBut in our cash flow statement, \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" already includes capital expenditures (like purchase of fixed assets), so the first method seems appropriate here.\n\n**2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio:**\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales. The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}} \\]\nWhere:\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Current Assets} + \\text{Ending Current Assets}}{2} \\]\n\n### Calculating Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: 803,237.11\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -437,464.43\n\nSo,\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = 803,237.11 + (-437,464.43) = 365,772.68 \\]\n\nWait a minute, but looking at the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents at the bottom of the cash flow statement, it's also 365,772.68. That makes sense because the net increase in cash should equal the sum of cash flows from operating and investing activities (assuming no financing activities are present here).\n\nSo, FCF is indeed 365,772.68.\n\n### Calculating Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue: 5,760,023.09\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial (Beginning) Total Current Assets: 8,000,000.00\n- End Total Current Assets: 10,261,562.67\n\nCalculate Average Current Assets:\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{8,000,000.00 + 10,261,562.67}{2} = \\frac{18,261,562.67}{2} = 9,130,781.335 \\]\n\nNow, Current Assets Turnover Ratio:\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5,760,023.09}{9,130,781.335} \\approx 0.6308 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.63\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. FCF:\n   - Operating: 803,237.11\n   - Investing: -437,464.43\n   - Sum: 365,772.68 (matches net increase in cash)\n\n2. Current Assets Turnover:\n   - Revenue: 5,760,023.09\n   - Avg Current Assets: (8,000,000 + 10,261,562.67)/2 = 9,130,781.335\n   - Ratio: 5,760,023.09 / 9,130,781.335 â‰ˆ 0.63\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '365772.68', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.63'}}\n```",
