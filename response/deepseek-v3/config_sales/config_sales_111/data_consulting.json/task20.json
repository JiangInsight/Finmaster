                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios: the Gross Profit Margin and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods.\n   \n   Formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**: This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It indicates the company's short-term liquidity.\n   \n   Formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the provided financial statements, let's pull out the numbers we need.\n\n**Income Statement:**\n- Total Revenue: \\$5,760,023.09\n- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): \\$3,140,000.00\n- Gross Profit: \\$2,620,023.09\n\n**Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: \\$803,237.11\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Liabilities: \\$1,548,001.20\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,620,023.09}{5,760,023.09} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\\[\n\\frac{2,620,023.09}{5,760,023.09} \\approx 0.4549\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\\[\n0.4549 \\times 100 \\approx 45.49\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **45.49%**.\n\n### Calculating Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{803,237.11}{1,548,001.20}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{803,237.11}{1,548,001.20} \\approx 0.519\n\\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately **0.52**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Gross Profit Margin:**\n- Gross Profit: \\$2,620,023.09\n- Total Revenue: \\$5,760,023.09\n- Calculation: (2,620,023.09 / 5,760,023.09) * 100 = 45.49%\n\n**Operating Cash Flow Ratio:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: \\$803,237.11\n- Total Current Liabilities: \\$1,548,001.20\n- Calculation: 803,237.11 / 1,548,001.20 â‰ˆ 0.519\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Gross Profit Margin\": \"45.49%\", \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"0.52\"}}\n```",
