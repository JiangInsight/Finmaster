                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio to understand how to compute them based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 1,548,001.20\n- **Total Non-current Liabilities:** Not explicitly given, but looking at the balance sheet, under liabilities, we only have \"Total Current Liabilities.\" There's no mention of long-term debt or other non-current liabilities. So, it seems the company doesn't have any non-current liabilities.\n  \n  Therefore, **Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20**\n\n- **Total Assets:** 15,653,266.97\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{1,548,001.20}{15,653,266.97} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n1,548,001.20 ÷ 15,653,266.97 ≈ 0.0989\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.10\n\nBut wait, in the example provided, the ratio was given to two decimal places as a string, so we'll represent it similarly.\n\nSo, **Debt to Asset Ratio = '0.10'**\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operations to the net income, indicating how much cash is generated per dollar of net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** 803,237.11\n- **Net Income (from Income Statement):** 1,105,265.77\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{803,237.11}{1,105,265.77} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n803,237.11 ÷ 1,105,265.77 ≈ 0.7267\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.73\n\nSo, **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = '0.73'**\n\n### Verification:\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't miss anything.\n\n- **Total Liabilities:** Only current liabilities are present (Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable sum to 1,548,001.20), no long-term debt mentioned.\n- **Total Assets:** Clearly stated as 15,653,266.97.\n  \n  So, Debt to Asset Ratio is correctly 1,548,001.20 / 15,653,266.97 ≈ 0.10.\n\n- **Operating Cash Flow:** 803,237.11 is correct from the cash flow statement.\n- **Net Income:** 1,105,265.77 is correct from the income statement.\n  \n  So, the ratio is correctly 803,237.11 / 1,105,265.77 ≈ 0.73.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '0.73'} }\n```",
