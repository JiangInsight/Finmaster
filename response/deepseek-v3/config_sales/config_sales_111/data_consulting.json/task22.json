                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate the Quick Ratio and the Net Profit Margin based on the provided financial statements. \n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\n**Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):**\nThis measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\nWhere:\n- Quick Assets = Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable\n  (In this case, it seems to be Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable, but typically inventory is excluded because it's not as liquid.)\n  \n**Net Profit Margin:**\nThis shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet (end amounts for 2024-01-28)**:\n- Cash on Hand: 4,863,237.11\n- Bank Deposits: 3,502,535.57\n- Interest Receivable: 11,346.19\n- Accounts Receivable: 1,454,443.80\n- Inventory: 430,000.00\n- Total Current Liabilities: 1,548,001.20\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n- Total Revenue: 5,760,023.09\n- Net Profit: 1,105,265.77\n\n### Calculating Quick Ratio\n\nFirst, identify quick assets. These are the most liquid assets excluding inventory:\n- Cash on Hand: 4,863,237.11\n- Bank Deposits: 3,502,535.57\n- Interest Receivable: 11,346.19\n- Accounts Receivable: 1,454,443.80\n\nTotal Quick Assets = 4,863,237.11 + 3,502,535.57 + 11,346.19 + 1,454,443.80\nLet's add them step by step:\n1. 4,863,237.11 + 3,502,535.57 = 8,365,772.68\n2. 8,365,772.68 + 11,346.19 = 8,377,118.87\n3. 8,377,118.87 + 1,454,443.80 = 9,831,562.67\n\nNow, Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{9,831,562.67}{1,548,001.20} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n9,831,562.67 ÷ 1,548,001.20 ≈ 6.35\n\nWait a minute, that seems quite high. Maybe I included too much in quick assets. Typically, quick assets exclude inventory, but include cash, marketable securities (like bank deposits), and accounts receivable. Interest receivable is also a quick asset, but sometimes it's not included if it's not significant. But here, it's part of current assets, so it's likely included.\n\nBut looking back at the example provided in the task, their quick ratio was calculated as 1.54 with similar items included. Maybe I made a mistake in adding.\n\nWait, let me recount:\nCash on Hand: 4,863,237.11\nBank Deposits: 3,502,535.57\nInterest Receivable: 11,346.19\nAccounts Receivable: 1,454,443.80\n\nAdding:\n4,863,237.11 + 3,502,535.57 = 8,365,772.68\n8,365,772.68 + 11,346.19 = 8,377,118.87\n8,377,118.87 + 1,454,443.80 = 9,831,562.67\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 1,548,001.20\n\n9,831,562.67 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 6.35\n\nHmm, maybe the example had higher current liabilities relative to quick assets. Here, quick assets are much higher than liabilities, leading to a high ratio. Maybe that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe quick assets exclude interest receivable. Let's try without it:\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable\n= 4,863,237.11 + 3,502,535.57 + 1,454,443.80\n= 4,863,237.11 + 3,502,535.57 = 8,365,772.68\n+ 1,454,443.80 = 9,820,216.48\n\nQuick Ratio = 9,820,216.48 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 6.34\n\nStill high. Maybe the example included only cash and accounts receivable, excluding bank deposits as marketable securities? But bank deposits are usually included.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the quick assets are just Cash + Accounts Receivable:\n= 4,863,237.11 + 1,454,443.80 = 6,317,680.91\nQuick Ratio = 6,317,680.91 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 4.08\n\nStill not matching the example's approach. Maybe the example included Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable, excluding interest receivable.\n\nGiven that, let's stick with the broader definition including interest receivable, giving us 6.35.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quick assets are Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable (excluding Accounts Receivable):\n= 4,863,237.11 + 3,502,535.57 + 11,346.19 = 8,377,118.87\nQuick Ratio = 8,377,118.87 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 5.41\n\nStill high. Maybe the correct quick assets are Cash + Accounts Receivable:\n= 4,863,237.11 + 1,454,443.80 = 6,317,680.91\nQuick Ratio = 6,317,680.91 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 4.08\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and looking at the example where they included Cash, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, and Accounts Receivable, leading to Quick Ratio = 1.54, I think the correct approach is to include all these except inventory.\n\nSo, Quick Assets = 9,831,562.67\nCurrent Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\nQuick Ratio = 9,831,562.67 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 6.35\n\nThis seems correct based on the data.\n\n### Calculating Net Profit Margin\n\nNet Profit = 1,105,265.77\nTotal Revenue = 5,760,023.09\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,105,265.77}{5,760,023.09} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nCalculating the division:\n1,105,265.77 ÷ 5,760,023.09 ≈ 0.1919\n\nMultiply by 100:\n0.1919 × 100 ≈ 19.19%\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter calculating:\n\n- Quick Ratio: 6.35\n- Net Profit Margin: 19.19%\n\nBut looking back at the example, their Net Profit was negative, so the margin was negative. Here, it's positive, so 19.19% seems correct.\n\nHowever, the Quick Ratio seems unusually high at 6.35, which might indicate that the company has a lot of liquid assets compared to its current liabilities, which is good. Maybe that's correct given the data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Quick Assets should exclude Interest Receivable, making it:\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable\n= 4,863,237.11 + 3,502,535.57 + 1,454,443.80 = 9,820,216.48\nQuick Ratio = 9,820,216.48 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 6.34\n\nStill high. Maybe only Cash + Accounts Receivable:\n= 4,863,237.11 + 1,454,443.80 = 6,317,680.91\nQuick Ratio = 6,317,680.91 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 4.08\n\nGiven that the example included all four (Cash, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, Accounts Receivable), leading to Quick Ratio = 1.54, and here if we do the same, it's much higher, perhaps that's correct.\n\nSo, sticking with:\n\nQuick Ratio = (Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n= (4,863,237.11 + 3,502,535.57 + 11,346.19 + 1,454,443.80) / 1,548,001.20\n= 9,831,562.67 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 6.35\n\nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n= (1,105,265.77 / 5,760,023.09) * 100 ≈ 19.19%\n\n### Final JSON\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '6.35', 'Net Profit Margin': '19.19%'}}\n```",
