                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio.\n\n### 1. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:**\nGross Profit Margin is a measure of a company's profitability and is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 2,620,023.09\n- Total Revenue = 5,760,023.09\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,620,023.09}{5,760,023.09} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\\[ \\frac{2,620,023.09}{5,760,023.09} \\approx 0.4549 \\]\n\nNow multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\\[ 0.4549 \\times 100 \\approx 45.49\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately 45.49%.\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio measures a company's ability to cover its debts with its operating cash flow and is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to identify:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n- Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 803,237.11\n\nNow, Total Debt isn't directly given, but we can infer it from the balance sheet. Total Debt typically includes current and non-current liabilities. \n\nLooking at the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed (only current liabilities and owner's equity are present).\n\nSo, Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{803,237.11}{1,548,001.20} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ \\frac{803,237.11}{1,548,001.20} \\approx 0.519 \\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately 0.519.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining both calculations:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '45.49%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.52'} }\n```\n\n*Note: I rounded the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio to two decimal places for clarity.*",
