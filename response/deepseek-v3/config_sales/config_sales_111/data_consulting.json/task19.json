                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Current Ratio and the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: This measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations with its current assets. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: This shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n   \\]\n   Since we only have the ending inventory (no beginning inventory other than zero), we'll assume the average inventory is the ending inventory (as beginning was zero).\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n\n- **Total Current Assets (End_amount)**: 10,261,562.67\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount)**: 1,548,001.20\n- **Inventory (End_amount)**: 430,000.00\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 3,140,000.00\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{10,261,562.67}{1,548,001.20}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10,261,562.67}{1,548,001.20} \\approx 6.63\n\\]\n\nSo, the Current Ratio is approximately **6.63**.\n\n### Calculating the Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\nSince the beginning inventory was 0 and the ending inventory is 430,000, the average inventory is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{0 + 430,000}{2} = 215,000\n\\]\n\nBut since the beginning inventory was zero, and all inventory was presumably acquired during the period, using ending inventory might be more appropriate here to avoid division by a very small number or zero. Alternatively, if we consider that the inventory was zero at the start and 430,000 at the end, and all purchases were during the period, the average would be 215,000. \n\nHowever, given that COGS is 3,140,000 and inventory at end is 430,000, and assuming no beginning inventory, the turnover is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} = \\frac{3,140,000}{215,000} \\approx 14.60\n\\]\n\nBut looking at the example provided, where beginning inventory was also zero, they used the ending inventory directly:\n\nIn the example:\n- COGS: 4,410,000\n- Inventory (end): 5,090,000\n- Inventory Turnover: 1.73 (which is 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 if average is (0 + 5,090,000)/2)\n\nWait no, 4,410,000 / 5,090,000 is ~0.87, but their answer is 1.73, which is 4,410,000 / (5,090,000 / 2) = 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73.\n\nSo they took average inventory as (beginning + ending)/2, even though beginning was zero.\n\nSo for our case:\nAverage inventory = (0 + 430,000) / 2 = 215,000\nInventory turnover = 3,140,000 / 215,000 ≈ 14.60\n\nBut that seems very high compared to the example's 1.73. Maybe the inventory was only there for a very short time, making turnover high.\n\nAlternatively, if we use ending inventory directly:\n3,140,000 / 430,000 ≈ 7.30\n\nBut given the example uses average, let's stick with average.\n\nSo Inventory Turnover Ratio ≈ 14.60\n\nBut that seems unusually high. Maybe the period is very short (one month), making turnover high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the inventory was purchased and sold within the month, leading to high turnover.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed with average inventory.\n\n### Final Calculations\n\n- **Current Ratio**: 6.63\n- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: 14.60\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, their inventory turnover was 1.73 with COGS 4,410,000 and inventory end 5,090,000 (average 2,545,000). Their period seems to be one month (from Dec 31 to Jan 30). \n\nOur period is also about one month (Dec 31 to Jan 28), COGS is 3,140,000, inventory end is 430,000 (average 215,000), so turnover is 3,140,000 / 215,000 ≈ 14.60.\n\nThis seems correct based on the formulas and given data, even though it's higher than the example.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '6.63', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '14.60'}}\n```\n\n**Wait a minute**, looking back at the example's calculation more carefully:\n\nIn the example:\n- COGS: 4,410,000\n- Inventory at end: 5,090,000\n- Beginning inventory: 0\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio: 1.73\n\nCalculation:\nAverage inventory = (0 + 5,090,000) / 2 = 2,545,000\nInventory turnover = 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73\n\nSimilarly, in our case:\nAverage inventory = (0 + 430,000) / 2 = 215,000\nInventory turnover = 3,140,000 / 215,000 ≈ 14.60\n\nThis seems correct based on the method used in the example. The high turnover could be due to the inventory being sold very quickly within the month.\n\nHowever, if we consider that the inventory at end is what's left after sales, and COGS is what was sold, then the total inventory handled during the period is COGS + ending inventory (assuming no beginning inventory), which would be 3,140,000 + 430,000 = 3,570,000, and average inventory would be (0 + 3,570,000) / 2 = 1,785,000, then turnover is 3,140,000 / 1,785,000 ≈ 1.76.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with the example's method. \n\nGiven that, sticking to the example's method seems safer, leading to:\n\nInventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory = 3,140,000 / 215,000 ≈ 14.60\n\nBut this seems too high. Maybe the correct interpretation is that the ending inventory is the only inventory, and COGS is what was sold from purchases during the period, so average inventory is ending inventory (since beginning was zero and all purchases were during the period), leading to:\n\nInventory Turnover = COGS / Ending Inventory = 3,140,000 / 430,000 ≈ 7.30\n\nBut the example contradicts this, as their COGS / Ending Inventory = 4,410,000 / 5,090,000 ≈ 0.87, but their answer is 1.73, which is COGS / (Ending / 2).\n\nGiven that, the most consistent with the example is:\n\nInventory Turnover = COGS / (Ending Inventory / 2) = 3,140,000 / (430,000 / 2) = 3,140,000 / 215,000 ≈ 14.60\n\nBut this seems impractical. Maybe the example has an error, and they meant COGS / Ending Inventory, which would be 4,410,000 / 5,090,000 ≈ 0.87, but they have 1.73, which is double.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the period is such that the average is ending / 2.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and to match the example's method, let's go with:\n\nInventory Turnover = COGS / (Ending Inventory / 2) = 14.60\n\nBut this seems too high. Maybe the correct interpretation is that the inventory was purchased and sold during the period, so the average is (beginning + ending) / 2 = (0 + 430,000) / 2 = 215,000, hence turnover is 3,140,000 / 215,000 ≈ 14.60.\n\nGiven that, and that the example seems to use this method, let's proceed with:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '6.63', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '14.60'}}\n```\n\nHowever, realistically, inventory turnover of 14.6 in a month implies inventory is sold and replaced 14.6 times in a month, which is extremely high (equivalent to selling all inventory every ~2 days). This suggests that perhaps the correct interpretation is that the ending inventory is what's left after sales, and COGS is what was sold, so average inventory is ending inventory (since beginning was zero and all purchases were during the period), leading to:\n\nInventory Turnover = COGS / Ending Inventory = 3,140,000 / 430,000 ≈ 7.30\n\nBut this still seems high. Maybe the example's method is incorrect, and the correct method is COGS / Average Inventory where average is (beginning + ending) / 2, leading here to 14.60.\n\nGiven that, and to match the example's approach, let's go with:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '6.63', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '14.60'}}\n```\n\nBut given that this seems unrealistically high, perhaps the correct method is COGS / Ending Inventory, leading to 7.30. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, and that the example uses COGS / (Ending / 2), let's stick with that for consistency.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '6.63', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '14.60'}}\n```",
