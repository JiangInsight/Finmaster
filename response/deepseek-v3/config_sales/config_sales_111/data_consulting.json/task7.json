In this case, the entire net cash flow from investing activities is the purchase of fixed assets, which represents capital expenditures.\n   - FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n   - FCF = 803,237.11 + (-437,464.43) = 365,772.68\n\n4. **Verify with Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The net increase in cash and cash equivalents is given as 365,772.68, which matches our FCF calculation. This serves as a cross-check.\n\nThus, the Free Cash Flow (FCF) is 365,772.68.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '365772.68'} }\n```",
