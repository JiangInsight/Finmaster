                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio, Gross Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 1,548,001.20\n- **Total Owner's Equity (End_amount):** 14,105,265.77\n- **Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity (End_amount):** 15,653,266.97\n\nWait, actually, the balance sheet shows that \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" equals \"Total Assets,\" which is correct. But to find \"Total Liabilities,\" it's the sum of all liabilities. Here, we have \"Total Current Liabilities\" as 1,548,001.20, and there's no mention of long-term liabilities, so it seems that's all the liabilities.\n\nSo:\n\\[ \\text{Total Liabilities} = 1,548,001.20 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Assets} = 15,653,266.97 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{1,548,001.20}{15,653,266.97} \\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,548,001.20}{15,653,266.97} \\approx 0.0989 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.10\n\nBut looking at the example, they seem to have it as '0.14', which suggests they might have included more liabilities or perhaps I missed something. Wait, in the example, \"Total Current Liabilities\" was 1,861,550.92, and \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" was 13,216,409.49, giving:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,861,550.92}{13,216,409.49} \\approx 0.1409 \\] which rounds to '0.14'.\n\nSimilarly, in our case, it's:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,548,001.20}{15,653,266.97} \\approx 0.0989 \\] so '0.10'.\n\nBut let me check if there are any other liabilities. The balance sheet only shows \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\" under current liabilities, and nothing else. So it seems correct to use 1,548,001.20.\n\n**Debt to Asset Ratio:** '0.10'\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 2,620,023.09\n- **Total Revenue:** 5,760,023.09 (Wait, actually it's 5,760,023.09, but the table shows \"Main Business Revenue\" as 5,760,023.09 and \"Total Revenue\" is the same.)\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,620,023.09}{5,760,023.09} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2,620,023.09}{5,760,023.09} \\approx 0.4549 \\]\n\\[ 0.4549 \\times 100 \\approx 45.49\\% \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: '45.49%'\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** 803,237.11\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 1,548,001.20\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{803,237.11}{1,548,001.20} \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\frac{803,237.11}{1,548,001.20} \\approx 0.5189 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: '0.52'\n\nBut in the example, they had a negative value and presented it as '-3.90', which seems to be the raw value without rounding to two decimal places. Maybe they kept more precision. Let's see:\n\n803,237.11 / 1,548,001.20 ≈ 0.518887\n\nSo '0.52' seems appropriate, unless they expect more decimal places. Given the example showed '-3.90', which is one decimal place, maybe '0.5' is sufficient. But '0.52' is more precise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect it as a string with two decimal places, like in the example '-3.90'. So '0.52'.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all three:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.49%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.52'}}\n```\n\nBut let me double-check the Operating Cash Flow Ratio in the example to see how they formatted it. In the example:\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,259,994.10\nTotal Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\n\nRatio: -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.90\n\nThey presented it as '-3.90', which is two decimal places. So in our case, '0.52' seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, Gross Profit Margin was '18.80%' (two decimal places), and Debt to Asset was '0.14' (two decimal places).\n\nSo my answer seems consistent with their formatting.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.49%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.52'}}\n```",
