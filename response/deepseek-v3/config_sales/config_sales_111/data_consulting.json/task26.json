                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three key financial ratios: Return on Equity (ROE), Debt to Asset Ratio, and Gross Profit Margin. I'll go through each one, explaining how to derive them from the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Return on Equity (ROE)\n\n**Definition:** ROE measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Shareholder's Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the given data:\n- **Net Profit (from Income Statement):** \\$1,105,265.77\n- **Shareholder's Equity (from Balance Sheet - End_amount for Total Owner's Equity):** \\$14,105,265.77\n\nCalculating:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{1,105,265.77}{14,105,265.77} \\times 100 \\approx 7.84\\% \\]\n\n### 2. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio indicates the proportion of a company's assets that are financed through debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Liabilities (from Balance Sheet - End_amount for Total Current Liabilities):** \\$1,548,001.20\n  - (Note: Only current liabilities are provided; if there were long-term liabilities, they'd be added here, but in this case, it seems only current liabilities exist.)\n- **Total Assets (from Balance Sheet - End_amount for Total Assets):** \\$15,653,266.97\n\nCalculating:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{1,548,001.20}{15,653,266.97} \\approx 0.0989 \\]\nRounded to two decimal places: 0.10\n\n### 3. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS), indicating how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** \\$2,620,023.09\n- **Total Revenue:** \\$5,760,023.09\n\nCalculating:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{2,620,023.09}{5,760,023.09} \\times 100 \\approx 45.49\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying Calculations\n\nLet me double-check each calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **ROE:**\n   - 1,105,265.77 / 14,105,265.77 = 0.07836 → 7.84% ✔\n\n2. **Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n   - 1,548,001.20 / 15,653,266.97 = 0.09889 → 0.10 ✔\n   - (Assuming no other liabilities beyond current liabilities are present.)\n\n3. **Gross Profit Margin:**\n   - 2,620,023.09 / 5,760,023.09 = 0.45486 → 45.49% ✔\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating each ratio, here's the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '7.84%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.49%'} }\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Debt to Asset Ratio:** It's important to note that if there were any long-term liabilities not listed in the provided balance sheet, they should be included in the total liabilities. However, based on the given data, only current liabilities are present, so the ratio is calculated accordingly.\n  \n- **ROE Interpretation:** An ROE of 7.84% means that for every dollar of shareholder equity, the company generated about 7.84 cents in profit. This is a positive sign, indicating profitability relative to equity.\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin:** A margin of 45.49% is quite healthy, suggesting that the company retains a good portion of revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold, which can be used to cover other expenses and profits.",
