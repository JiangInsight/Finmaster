                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Asset Ratio\nFirst, I need to understand what the Debt to Asset Ratio is. From what I know, it's a financial ratio that measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nBut sometimes, \"Total Debt\" can be interpreted as \"Total Liabilities.\" So, it's essential to see what's given in the balance sheet.\n\n### Looking at the Balance Sheet\nThe balance sheet provided has several accounts, but the ones that seem relevant are:\n\n1. **Total Assets**: This is given directly as \"Total Assets\" with an \"End_amount\" of 15,653,266.97.\n2. **Total Liabilities**: This isn't directly labeled as \"Total Liabilities,\" but we have \"Total Current Liabilities\" with an \"End_amount\" of 1,548,001.20. There's no mention of long-term liabilities, so it seems that all liabilities are current in this case.\n\n### Identifying Total Debt\nSince there's no separate long-term debt listed, the \"Total Current Liabilities\" would represent the total debt for this calculation. So, Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 1,548,001.20.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{1,548,001.20}{15,653,266.97} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n1,548,001.20 ÷ 15,653,266.97 ≈ 0.0989\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's approximately 0.10.\n\n### Verifying\nJust to make sure, let's see if there are any other liabilities. The balance sheet shows:\n\n- Accounts Payable: 1,260,000.00\n- Taxes Payable: 288,001.20\n- Total Current Liabilities: 1,548,001.20 (which is the sum of the above)\n\nNo other liabilities are listed under non-current or long-term, so it seems correct to use 1,548,001.20 as the total debt.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.10.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10'} }\n```",
