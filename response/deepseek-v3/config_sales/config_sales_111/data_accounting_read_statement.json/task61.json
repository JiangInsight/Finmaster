In the given problem, the Selling Expenses amount is `793728.19`.\n   - **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is typically found in the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" line item in the Cash Flow Statement under Investing Activities. In the given problem, the Purchase of Fixed Assets amount is `437464.43`.\n\n2. **Grouping by financial statement**:\n   - The Income Statement (where Selling Expenses is located) is checked first, followed by the Cash Flow Statement (where Purchase of Fixed Assets is located), as per the task's instruction to group by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. The Balance Sheet does not contain any of the required line items in this case.\n\n3. **Maintaining original order**:\n   - The line items are presented in the order they appear in their respective financial statements. \"Selling Expenses\" appears before \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the sequence of financial statements checked.\n\nThus, the final answer is `{'value1': '793728.19', 'value2': '437464.43'}`.",
