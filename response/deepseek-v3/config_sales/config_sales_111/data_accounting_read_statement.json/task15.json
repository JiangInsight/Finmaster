Here's how we can extract them:\n\n1. **Initial Value**: The initial value of the total owner's equity is given as '13000000.00' on the initial date '2023-12-31'.\n2. **End Value**: The end value of the total owner's equity is given as '14105265.77' on the end date '2024-01-28'.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '14105265.77'} }\n```",
