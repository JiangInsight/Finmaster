In the given problem, it is labeled as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with an amount of 3140000.00.\n\nThe order of the values in the solution should match the order in which these line items appear in the income statement. \n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n- First line item (Main Business Revenue): 5760023.09\n- Second line item (Cost of Goods Sold): 3140000.00\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5760023.09', 'value2': '3140000.00'} }\n```",
