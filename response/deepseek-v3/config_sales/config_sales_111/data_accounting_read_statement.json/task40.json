This is typically reflected in the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" line item, as accounts payable represents amounts owed to suppliers for goods or services received on credit.\n\nLooking at the provided cash flow statement, we can see the following line items under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\":\n\n- Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable: 1260000.00\n\nThis line item indicates an increase in accounts payable, meaning the entity owes more to its suppliers at the end of the period compared to the beginning, which aligns with the task description.\n\nTherefore, the value to be extracted is '1260000.00'.\n\nThe solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1260000.00'}}\n```",
