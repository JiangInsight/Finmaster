                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand how to find the net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period, and then identify its two component sub-items from the given cash flow statement.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's recall what a cash flow statement shows. It provides information about the cash inflows and outflows of a company during a specific period, categorized into three main activities:\n1. **Operating Activities**: Cash generated or used in the core business operations.\n2. **Investing Activities**: Cash used for or generated from investments like purchasing or selling assets.\n3. **Financing Activities**: Cash from or used in financing the business, like issuing stock or paying dividends.\n\nHowever, in the given problem, we don't have the \"Financing Activities\" section, but that's okay because we're focusing on the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, which shows the net increase or decrease in cash.\n\n### Identifying the Net Addition in Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nFrom the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section in the problem, we have:\n- **Beginning Balance**: 8,000,000.00 (This is the cash at the start of the period)\n- **Ending Balance**: 8,365,772.68 (This is the cash at the end of the period)\n- **Net Increase**: 365,772.68 (This is the difference between ending and beginning balances)\n\nSo, the net addition (increase) in cash and cash equivalents during the period is **365,772.68**.\n\n### Decomposing the Net Increase into Two Sub-items\n\nThe net increase in cash is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Net Increase} = \\text{Ending Balance} - \\text{Beginning Balance} \\]\n\nTherefore, the two sub-items that make up the net increase are:\n1. **Ending Balance**: 8,365,772.68\n2. **Beginning Balance**: 8,000,000.00\n\nThese are directly taken from the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section of the statement.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example:\n- Net Increase was -7,565,348.53\n- Sub-items were:\n  - sub_item value1: 8,000,000.00 (Beginning Balance)\n  - sub_item value2: 434,651.47 (Ending Balance)\n\nThis matches our understanding that:\n\\[ \\text{Net Increase} = \\text{Ending Balance} - \\text{Beginning Balance} \\]\n\\[ -7,565,348.53 = 434,651.47 - 8,000,000.00 \\]\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nNow, applying this to our problem:\n- **value (Net Increase)**: 365,772.68\n- **sub_item value1 (Beginning Balance)**: 8,000,000.00\n- **sub_item value2 (Ending Balance)**: 8,365,772.68\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"365772.68\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value1\": \"8000000.00\", \"sub_item value2\": \"8365772.68\"}}}\n```",
