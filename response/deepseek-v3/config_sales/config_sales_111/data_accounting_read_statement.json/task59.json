I'm going to break it down to understand what we're being asked to do and then find the specific pieces of information we need.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe're given three financial statements:\n1. **Balance Sheet**\n2. **Income Statement**\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**\n\nWe need to extract two specific pieces of information:\n1. The **amount of interest accrued but not yet received**.\n2. The **net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**.\n\nThese values should be grouped by the financial statement they come from, in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, we maintain the original order of the line items as they appear in the statements.\n\nFrom the example provided, it seems:\n- `value1` corresponds to the \"Interest Receivable\" from the Balance Sheet.\n- `value2` corresponds to the \"Net Increase\" in \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" from the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nBut let's confirm this by looking at the example's solution:\n- `value1`: '2672.87' — This matches the \"Interest Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet under \"End_amount\".\n- `value2`: '-7565348.53' — This matches the \"Net Increase\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nSo, our approach is:\n1. Look for \"Interest Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet's \"End_amount\" column.\n2. Look for \"Net Increase\" in the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section of the Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### Applying This to the Given Problem\n\nLet's go through each statement in the given problem.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet table, we're interested in the \"Interest Receivable\" line item.\n\nHere's the relevant part:\n```\n| Interest Receivable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 11346.19 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\n\nSo, the \"End_amount\" for \"Interest Receivable\" is `11346.19`. This will be our `value1`.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nThe task mentions identifying two specific line items, but in the example, only the Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement were used. The Income Statement in the example had \"Interest Income\", but it wasn't part of the output. \n\nLooking at our current Income Statement:\n```\n| Interest Income | 11346.19 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\n\nThis matches the \"Interest Receivable\" from the Balance Sheet, but since the example didn't use this, and the task mentions \"interest accrued but not yet received\" which is typically an asset (hence Balance Sheet), we might not need this. But to be thorough, let's see if there's another line item we might need.\n\nBut since the example only used two values, and our `value1` is from Balance Sheet, `value2` should be from Cash Flow Statement, skipping Income Statement unless specified otherwise.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nNow, looking for the \"net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\".\n\nIn the Cash Flow Statement, there's a section:\n```\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-01-28 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Ending Balance  | 8365772.68 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Increase  | 365772.68 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\n\nThe \"Net Increase\" is `365772.68`. This will be our `value2`.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nIn the example:\n- `value1` was \"Interest Receivable\" from Balance Sheet.\n- `value2` was \"Net Increase\" from Cash Flow Statement.\n\nSimilarly, here:\n- `value1`: \"Interest Receivable\" = `11346.19`\n- `value2`: \"Net Increase\" = `365772.68`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '11346.19', 'value2': '365772.68'} }\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Identify the required line items**:\n   - Interest accrued but not yet received: Found in Balance Sheet as \"Interest Receivable\".\n   - Net addition in cash and cash equivalents: Found in Cash Flow Statement as \"Net Increase\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\".\n\n2. **Extract the values**:\n   - From Balance Sheet: \"Interest Receivable\" → End_amount = `11346.19`.\n   - From Cash Flow Statement: \"Net Increase\" = `365772.68`.\n\n3. **Construct the JSON output**:\n   - `value1`: '11346.19'\n   - `value2`: '365772.68'\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '11346.19', 'value2': '365772.68'} }\n```",
