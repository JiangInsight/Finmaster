This line item is typically labeled as \"Depreciation\" in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task is to find the value associated with the depreciation expense in the provided cash flow statement. Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of an asset over its useful life.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the given cash flow statement, under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, there is a line item labeled \"Depreciation\" with an amount of \"45760.13\" dated \"2024-01-28\".\n3. **Verify the Context**: The line item \"Depreciation\" fits the description of the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with the \"Depreciation\" line item is \"45760.13\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45760.13'} }\n```",
