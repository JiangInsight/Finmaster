This information is typically found under \"Paid-in Capital\" or similar headings in the equity section of the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Paid-in Capital\" represents the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Paid-in Capital\" is provided as `13000000.00` with the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Paid-in Capital\" is also `13000000.00` with the end date `2024-01-28`. This indicates that there was no change in the paid-in capital during the period.\n\n4. **Verify Consistency**:\n   - Both the initial and end values are the same, which suggests that no additional capital was contributed by shareholders during this period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
