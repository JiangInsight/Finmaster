                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through the income statement provided and identify the three specific line items we're interested in:\n\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Terms\n\nFirst, let's understand what each of these terms generally refers to in an income statement:\n\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**: This typically refers to the revenue generated from the main operations of the business. In income statements, this is often labeled as \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is essentially the cost associated with the goods that were sold during the period. It's commonly referred to as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**: These are the overhead costs not directly tied to production or sales. They're usually listed as \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n\n### Step 2: Locating the Items in the Given Income Statement\n\nNow, let's look at the provided income statement and find these items:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 5760023.09 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Total Revenue | 5760023.09 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 3140000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Total Cost | 3140000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Gross Profit | 2620023.09 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 286483.51 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Selling Expenses | 793728.19 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Depreciation | 45760.13 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Financial Expenses | 112130.48 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Total Expenses | 1238102.31 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Interest Income | 11346.19 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 1393266.97 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Tax Expense | 288001.20 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Profit | 1105265.77 | 2024-01-28 |\n\n1. **Total income from ordinary activities**:\n   - Both \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\" seem to represent the income from ordinary activities. Since \"Total Revenue\" is a more encompassing term, it's likely the one we want. Both have the same amount here: 5760023.09.\n   - **Value1**: 5760023.09\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold (COGS)**:\n   - \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is clearly listed with an amount of 3140000.00.\n   - **Value2**: 3140000.00\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration**:\n   - \"Administrative Expenses\" is the line item that typically covers general management and administration costs. Here, it's 286483.51.\n   - **Value3**: 286483.51\n\n### Step 3: Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the provided example to ensure we're on the right track:\n\n- In the example, 'value1' was \"Main Business Revenue\" (5431018.59), 'value2' was \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (4410000.00), and 'value3' was \"Administrative Expenses\" (1425164.20).\n  \nThis aligns with our understanding:\n- 'value1' is the main revenue (could be \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue\" if they differ; here they're the same).\n- 'value2' is COGS.\n- 'value3' is Administrative Expenses.\n\n### Step 4: Finalizing the Answer\n\nGiven that, here's how we map the current problem:\n\n- 'value1': \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue\" → Both are 5760023.09. Following the example, \"Main Business Revenue\" was used, so we'll use that.\n- 'value2': \"Cost of Goods Sold\" → 3140000.00\n- 'value3': \"Administrative Expenses\" → 286483.51\n\nHowever, in the example, 'value1' was \"Main Business Revenue\" even though \"Total Revenue\" was also present with the same value. To be consistent with the example's approach, we'll use \"Main Business Revenue\" for 'value1'.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5760023.09', 'value2': '3140000.00', 'value3': '286483.51'}}\n```\n\n### Additional Verification\n\nJust to double-check:\n\n- The example had:\n  - 'value1': Main Business Revenue\n  - 'value2': Cost of Goods Sold\n  - 'value3': Administrative Expenses\n\nOur mapping is identical in structure, just with the current statement's numbers. So, this seems correct.\n\n### Potential Confusion Points\n\nOne might wonder why not use \"Total Revenue\" for 'value1' since it's also present. The example suggests using \"Main Business Revenue\" when both are present and equal, so we follow that precedent. If they differed, we'd likely choose \"Total Revenue\" as it encompasses all ordinary income.\n\nAlso, \"Total Cost\" is the same as COGS here, but COGS is the more specific term for inventories sold, so we use that.\n\n\"Administrative Expenses\" is clearly the right choice for general management costs, distinct from selling or financial expenses.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the income statement and comparing with the given example, the correct extraction is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5760023.09', 'value2': '3140000.00', 'value3': '286483.51'}}\n```",
