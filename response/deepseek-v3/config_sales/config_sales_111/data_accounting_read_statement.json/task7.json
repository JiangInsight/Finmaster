In the balance sheet, expenses are often reflected through items like \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" which is a contra-asset account representing the total depreciation expense accumulated over time.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is the most relevant as it directly relates to depreciation expense, which is an expense in the income statement. \n\n3. **Extract Initial and End Values**: \n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is `45760.13` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-01-28`.\n\n4. **Verify Other Line Items**: No other line items in the balance sheet directly represent expenses (e.g., there are no entries for \"Salaries Expense,\" \"Rent Expense,\" etc.). Thus, \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is the only relevant expense-related item.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '45760.13'} }\n```",
