The line item we are interested in is \"Bank Deposits,\" which represents the amount of money deposited into a bank. \n\nFrom the given balance sheet:\n- The \"Bank Deposits\" line item has an \"Initial_amount\" of \"5000000.00\" as of the \"Initial_date\" \"2023-12-31\".\n- The \"Bank Deposits\" line item has an \"End_amount\" of \"3502535.57\" as of the \"End_date\" \"2024-01-28\".\n\nTherefore, the initial value of the bank deposits is \"5000000.00\" and the end value is \"3502535.57\".\n\nHere is the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '3502535.57'} }\n```",
