                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement analysis step by step. I'm going to identify and extract three specific line items from the given financial statements based on the task description. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific values from the financial statements:\n1. **Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit**: This typically refers to \"Accounts Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet.\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually labeled as \"Financial Expenses\" in the Income Statement.\n3. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is often found as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThe order to present these is:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\nLooking at the Balance Sheet section, we're interested in \"Accounts Receivable\". Here's the relevant line:\n```\nAccounts Receivable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 1454443.80 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\nThe \"End_amount\" for Accounts Receivable is **1454443.80**. This is our first value (`value1`).\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\nNext, we look for \"Financial Expenses\" in the Income Statement:\n```\nFinancial Expenses | 112130.48 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\nThe amount here is **112130.48**. This is our second value (`value2`).\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nFinally, we check the Cash Flow Statement for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\":\n```\nPurchase of Fixed Assets  | 437464.43 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\nThe amount is **437464.43**. This is our third value (`value3`).\n\n### Verifying the Values\nLet me double-check to ensure I've picked the correct line items:\n- **Accounts Receivable**: Yes, it's the amount customers owe for credit sales.\n- **Financial Expenses**: Correct, these are costs related to financing (like interest on loans).\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: Yes, this represents cash spent on long-term assets like property, plant, and equipment.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1454443.80', 'value2': '112130.48', 'value3': '437464.43'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. **Identify \"Accounts Receivable\" in Balance Sheet**: Found the end amount as 1,454,443.80.\n2. **Identify \"Financial Expenses\" in Income Statement**: Found the amount as 112,130.48.\n3. **Identify \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in Cash Flow Statement**: Found the amount as 437,464.43.\n4. **Compile the values in the specified order**: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement.\n5. **Present the final answer in JSON format**.\n\nThis method ensures that we accurately extract the required financial metrics from the appropriate statements in the correct order.",
