This is because COGS reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, which includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the goods, as well as the carrying amount of inventories sold.\n\n2. **Identifying the Line Item**: In the given income statement, the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is explicitly listed with an amount of \"3140000.00\".\n\n3. **Verifying the Line Item**: To ensure accuracy, we can cross-reference with the \"Total Cost\" line, which is also \"3140000.00\". This confirms that \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is the primary component of the total cost in this context.\n\n4. **Extracting the Value**: The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is \"3140000.00\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3140000.00'} }\n```",
