These are typically referred to as \"Current Liabilities\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Liabilities**: \n   - Current liabilities are obligations that are expected to be settled within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually within one year). \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Current Liabilities\" are:\n     - Accounts Payable\n     - Taxes Payable\n     - Total Current Liabilities\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Total Current Liabilities\" line item provides the aggregate value of all current liabilities at the initial and end dates.\n   - From the table:\n     - **Initial_amount** for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `0.00` (as of `2023-12-31`).\n     - **End_amount** for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `1548001.20` (as of `2024-01-28`).\n\n3. **Verify Components**:\n   - The individual components of \"Total Current Liabilities\" are:\n     - Accounts Payable: `1260000.00` (end amount)\n     - Taxes Payable: `288001.20` (end amount)\n   - Sum of these components: `1260000.00 + 288001.20 = 1548001.20`, which matches the \"Total Current Liabilities\" end amount. This confirms the correctness of the extraction.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1548001.20'}}\n```",
