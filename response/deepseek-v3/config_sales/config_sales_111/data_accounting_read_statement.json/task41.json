In cash flow statements, this is typically labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, we look for the line item related to tax payable. We find:\n   - \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an amount of \"288001.20\" and date \"2024-01-28\".\n\n3. **Verify the Context**: This line item is indeed under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, which is the correct category for such adjustments. The positive value indicates an increase in tax payable (i.e., tax accrued but not yet paid).\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value corresponding to the increase in tax payable is \"288001.20\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '288001.20'} }\n```",
