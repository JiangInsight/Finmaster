In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Net Profit.\"\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This represents cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets. In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nFrom the given problem, we can extract these values as follows:\n\n- **Net Profit**: The value is `1105265.77` under the \"Net Profit\" line item.\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: The value is `437464.43` under the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" line item.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1105265.77', 'value2': '437464.43'} }\n```",
