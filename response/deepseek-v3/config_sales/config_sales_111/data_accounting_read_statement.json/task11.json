This is typically represented by the \"Retained Earnings\" line item in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Line Item**: \n   - The line item that represents the profit or loss retained in the entity is \"Retained Earnings\". This is part of the \"Owner's Equity\" section in the balance sheet.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Retained Earnings\" is given as \"0.00\" on the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Retained Earnings\" is given as \"1105265.77\" on the end date \"2024-01-28\".\n\n4. **Verify**:\n   - The initial and end values are clearly stated in the \"Retained Earnings\" row of the provided balance sheet. No further calculations are needed as the values are directly available.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1105265.77'} }\n```",
