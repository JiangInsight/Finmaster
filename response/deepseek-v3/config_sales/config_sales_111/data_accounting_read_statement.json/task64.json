I'm going to break it down to understand what each of the three values we need to extract represents and where to find them in the given financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to identify and extract three specific line items from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under Owner's Equity, often labeled as \"Paid-in Capital\" or \"Share Capital.\"\n   \n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is the \"Profit Before Tax\" and is usually found in the Income Statement.\n   \n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This refers to the increase in \"Accounts Payable,\" which can be found in the Cash Flow Statement under the operating activities section, labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\"\n\nThe order in which we present these values should follow the financial statement order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nLet's go through each financial statement in the provided problem to locate these items.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet section, we have:\n\n```\n| Paid-in Capital | 13000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 13000000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\n\nThis is the capital contributed by shareholders. The initial and end amounts are the same, which suggests no additional capital was contributed during the period, but the value is clearly `13000000.00`.\n\n**Value1: '13000000.00'**\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nIn the Income Statement, we see:\n\n```\n| Profit Before Tax | 1393266.97 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\n\nThis is the profit before tax expense is deducted, exactly what we're looking for.\n\n**Value2: '1393266.97'**\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nIn the Cash Flow Statement, under operating activities:\n\n```\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 1260000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\n\nThis represents the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services purchased on credit during the period.\n\n**Value3: '1260000.00'**\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nJust to ensure I'm on the right track, let's look at the provided example's solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '-1373590.51', 'value3': '1590000.00'}}\n```\n\n- `value1` was 'Paid-in Capital' from the Balance Sheet.\n- `value2` was 'Profit Before Tax' from the Income Statement.\n- `value3` was 'Increase in Accounts Payable' from the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThis matches our understanding, so our approach seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1393266.97', 'value3': '1260000.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Identify the three required values**:\n   - Capital from shareholders (Balance Sheet - Paid-in Capital).\n   - Profit before tax (Income Statement - Profit Before Tax).\n   - Increase in accounts payable (Cash Flow Statement - Increase in Accounts Payable).\n\n2. **Locate each in the provided statements**:\n   - Balance Sheet: 'Paid-in Capital' is `13000000.00`.\n   - Income Statement: 'Profit Before Tax' is `1393266.97`.\n   - Cash Flow Statement: 'Increase in Accounts Payable' is `1260000.00`.\n\n3. **Order them as per the instructions**:\n   - Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement, then Cash Flow Statement.\n\n4. **Construct the JSON output** with the identified values.\n\nThus, the final solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1393266.97', 'value3': '1260000.00'}}\n```",
