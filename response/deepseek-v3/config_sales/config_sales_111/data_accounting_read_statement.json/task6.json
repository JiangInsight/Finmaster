These items are typically categorized as \"Fixed Assets\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - From the given balance sheet, the line item that represents tangible items held for use in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes is \"Fixed Assets\". This is because fixed assets include property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) which are used in these capacities.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Fixed Assets\" is provided in the \"Initial_amount\" column, which is `5000000.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Fixed Assets\" is provided in the \"End_amount\" column, which is `5437464.43` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-01-28`.\n\n4. **Verify Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item shows the depreciation charged on these fixed assets. However, the net value of fixed assets is already reflected in the \"Fixed Assets\" line, so we do not need to adjust for depreciation separately in this context.\n\n5. **Final Values**:\n   - The initial value of fixed assets is `5000000.00`.\n   - The end value of fixed assets is `5437464.43`.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5437464.43'} }\n```",
