This is because selling expenses include costs associated with marketing, sales commissions, shipping, and other activities directly tied to generating and fulfilling customer orders.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Given Income Statement**: \n   - The income statement provided includes a line item labeled \"Selling Expenses\" with an amount of \"793728.19\".\n   - Other line items like \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Depreciation\", and \"Financial Expenses\" are not directly related to securing orders or delivering goods/services.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The value that represents the costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services is the amount listed under \"Selling Expenses\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '793728.19'}}\n```",
