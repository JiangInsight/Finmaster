Let's break down each requirement and find the corresponding line item in the problem statement:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**: This refers to \"Selling Expenses\" because these are the costs associated with marketing, selling, and delivering products or services to customers.\n   - In the problem, \"Selling Expenses\" is listed with an amount of `793728.19`.\n\n2. **The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This refers to \"Depreciation\" because depreciation is the allocation of the cost of an asset over its useful life.\n   - In the problem, \"Depreciation\" is listed with an amount of `45760.13`.\n\n3. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This refers to \"Financial Expenses\" because these are the costs associated with borrowing funds (e.g., interest expenses).\n   - In the problem, \"Financial Expenses\" is listed with an amount of `112130.48`.\n\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period**: This refers to \"Tax Expense\" because this line item represents the taxes owed or recovered for the period.\n   - In the problem, \"Tax Expense\" is listed with an amount of `288001.20`.\n\nNow, we can fill in the values in the required JSON format, maintaining the order of the line items as they appear in the problem statement (Selling Expenses, Depreciation, Financial Expenses, Tax Expense).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '793728.19', 'value2': '45760.13', 'value3': '112130.48', 'value4': '288001.20'} }\n```",
