                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line item and value that represents the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit during the period. This is typically reflected in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section as \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable.\"\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are looking for the line item that shows the change in accounts receivable, which indicates the decrease (or increase) in amounts owed to the entity for credit sales or services provided.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is present under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities.\"\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with this line item is \"-1454443.80.\" A negative value here indicates an increase in accounts receivable (i.e., amounts owed to the entity have increased), but the question asks for the \"decrease\" in amounts owed. Therefore, the value we are interested in is the negative of the given value if it were positive (but in this case, it's negative, so it's actually an increase).\n\n   However, the question seems to be asking for the value as it appears in the statement, which represents the change in accounts receivable. Since the task description mentions \"decrease in amounts owed,\" and the value is negative, it implies an increase, but the task might be asking for the raw value as it appears in the statement.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: Based on the example provided, the solution is the value of the \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" line item, regardless of its sign. \n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1454443.80'}}\n```",
