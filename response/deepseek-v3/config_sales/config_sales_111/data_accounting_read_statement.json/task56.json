This is typically referred to as \"Depreciation\" in financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Identify Depreciation in the Balance Sheet**: \n   - In the balance sheet, look for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" under the \"Fixed Assets\" section. The value here is \"45760.13\" as of the end date \"2024-01-28\". However, this represents the total accumulated depreciation over time, not the depreciation for the current period.\n\n2. **Identify Depreciation in the Cash Flow Statement**: \n   - In the cash flow statement, under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\", there is a line item \"Depreciation\" with the value \"45760.13\". This represents the depreciation expense for the current period.\n\n3. **Identify Depreciation in the Income Statement**: \n   - In the income statement, under \"Total Expenses\", there is a line item \"Depreciation\" with the value \"45760.13\". This confirms the depreciation expense for the current period.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - The depreciation expense for the period is consistently reported as \"45760.13\" in both the cash flow statement and the income statement. This is the value we are looking for.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45760.13'} }\n```",
