This represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\nHereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant line item**: The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is typically reported as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the income statement.\n2. **Locate the value**: In the provided income statement, the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is listed with an amount of `3140000.00`.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3140000.00'}}\n```",
