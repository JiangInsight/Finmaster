These are typically non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets and other long-term investments.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We need to find the line items that represent assets not expected to be realized or consumed within the normal operating cycle. These are usually categorized as non-current assets.\n\n2. **Identify Non-Current Assets**: In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Total Non-current Assets\" are the ones that fit this description. Specifically, \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation\" are part of non-current assets.\n\n3. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The initial amount for \"Total Non-current Assets\" is `5000000.00` as of the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n   - **End Value**: The end amount for \"Total Non-current Assets\" is `5391704.30` as of the end date `2024-01-28`.\n\n4. **Verify**: The \"Total Non-current Assets\" line item is the sum of \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation\" (though the latter is a contra account, it is already accounted for in the total). The initial and end values for \"Total Non-current Assets\" are clearly stated in the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5391704.30'} }\n```",
