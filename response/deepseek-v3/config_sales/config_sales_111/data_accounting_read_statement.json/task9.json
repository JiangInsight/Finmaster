This is typically listed under \"Taxes Payable\" in the liabilities section.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - Look for \"Taxes Payable\" in the balance sheet. This line item represents taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\" is `288001.20` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-01-28`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '288001.20'} }\n```",
