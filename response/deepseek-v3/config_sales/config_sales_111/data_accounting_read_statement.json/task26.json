In an income statement, these are usually listed under \"Financial Expenses\" or \"Interest Expenses.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing the Given Income Statement**: \n   - The income statement provided includes a line item labeled \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of \"112130.48\" dated \"2024-01-28.\"\n   - This line item is the most direct representation of financing costs in the given statement.\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - Other line items like \"Interest Income\" represent earnings from investments, not costs.\n   - \"Administrative Expenses,\" \"Selling Expenses,\" and \"Depreciation\" are operational costs, not financing costs.\n   - Therefore, \"Financial Expenses\" is the correct line item to extract.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The value of financing costs is \"112130.48.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '112130.48'}}\n```",
