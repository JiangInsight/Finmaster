These transactions represent sales that have not yet been collected in cash, thus increasing accounts receivable.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Identify Unpaid Sales with Account Receivable:**\n   - We look for all sales transactions where:\n     - `payment/receipt_status` = \"Unpaid\"\n     - `receive_method` = \"Account Receviable\"\n\n2. **List of Relevant Transactions:**\n   - From the provided data, the following transactions meet the criteria:\n     - Sale20240102005: $25,862.64\n     - Sale20240103008: $116,350.08\n     - Sale20240106022: $19,087.90\n     - Sale20240107026: $72,420.34\n     - Sale20240107027: $17,299.30\n     - Sale20240109035: $8,585.48\n     - Sale20240112045: $9,056.94\n     - Sale20240113046: $37,955.74\n     - Sale20240116061: $36,507.61\n     - Sale20240116062: $113,277.99\n     - Sale20240118070: $182,159.24\n     - Sale20240120080: $186,634.74\n     - Sale20240121085: $8,657.27\n     - Sale20240123094: $114,947.10\n     - Sale20240124098: $17,284.38\n     - Sale20240124099: $86,327.57\n     - Sale20240124100: $9,014.45\n     - Sale20240125105: $98,695.47\n     - Sale20240127114: $268,474.80\n     - Sale20240128118: $25,844.76\n\n3. **Sum of Unpaid Sales:**\n   - Add up all the amounts from the above transactions:\n     - 25,862.64 + 116,350.08 + 19,087.90 + 72,420.34 + 17,299.30 + 8,585.48 + 9,056.94 + 37,955.74 + 36,507.61 + 113,277.99 + 182,159.24 + 186,634.74 + 8,657.27 + 114,947.10 + 17,284.38 + 86,327.57 + 9,014.45 + 98,695.47 + 268,474.80 + 25,844.76 = **1,436,201.70**\n\n4. **Calculate the Change in Accounts Receivable:**\n   - The \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is the negative of the total unpaid sales (since an increase in accounts receivable is a use of cash in the cash flow statement):\n     - -1,436,201.70\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-1436201.70'}}\n```",
