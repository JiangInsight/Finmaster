I'm going to break it down into manageable parts to ensure I understand each component before putting everything together.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nWe have a set of transactions that occurred between December 31, 2023, and January 28, 2024. Our goal is to create a balance sheet showing both the initial and final amounts based on these transactions.\n\nA balance sheet has three main sections:\n1. **Assets**: What the company owns.\n   - Current Assets: Cash, accounts receivable, inventory, etc.\n   - Non-current Assets: Fixed assets, less accumulated depreciation.\n2. **Liabilities**: What the company owes.\n   - Current Liabilities: Accounts payable, taxes payable, etc.\n   - Non-current Liabilities: Long-term debts (not present here).\n3. **Owner's Equity**: The owner's claim on the assets.\n   - Paid-in capital, retained earnings.\n\n### Initial Values\n\nFrom the transactions labeled \"Initial20231231001\", we have:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00\n\nAssuming no other initial values are provided, we can set:\n- Interest Receivable, Accounts Receivable, Inventory: 0.00\n- Accounts Payable, Taxes Payable: 0.00\n- Paid-in Capital: Total Assets (since no liabilities initially) = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.00\n- Retained Earnings: 0.00\n\n### Calculating Final Values\n\nNow, let's process the transactions to update these initial values to their final amounts.\n\n#### 1.
