Depreciation is typically recorded as an expense in the income statement and is listed under transactions with the type \"Depreciation\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Depreciation Transactions**: \n   - Look through the transactions data for entries where the \"type\" is \"Depreciation\".\n   - In the provided data, there is one such transaction with the ID \"Depreciation20240101001\".\n\n2. **Extract the Depreciation Amount**:\n   - The amount for this transaction is listed as \"45760.130000000005\".\n   - Since depreciation amounts are usually rounded to two decimal places, we can round this to \"45760.13\".\n\n3. **Final Answer**:\n   - The depreciation amount to be reported in the income statement is \"45760.13\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45760.13'} }\n```",
