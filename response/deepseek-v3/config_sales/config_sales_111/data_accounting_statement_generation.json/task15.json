Liabilities typically include accounts payable and any other unpaid obligations. \n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Liabilities:**\n   - The initial liabilities are the amounts from transactions marked as \"Unpaid\" with a payment method of \"Account Payable\" at the start of the period (2023-12-31).\n   - From the given data, the initial unpaid purchases are:\n     - Purchase20231231002: 60,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - Purchase20231231003: 60,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - Purchase20231231004: 100,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - Purchase20231231005: 45,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - Purchase20231231008: 20,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - Purchase20231231009: 160,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - Purchase20231231010: 250,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - Purchase20231231012: 140,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - Purchase20231231014: 30,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - Purchase20231231018: 150,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - Purchase20231231019: 200,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - Purchase20231231022: 45,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n   - Sum of initial liabilities: \n     \\( 60,000 + 60,000 + 100,000 + 45,000 + 20,000 + 160,000 + 250,000 + 140,000 + 30,000 + 150,000 + 200,000 + 45,000 = 1,160,000.0 \\)\n\n2. **Identify Final Liabilities:**\n   - The final liabilities include the initial unpaid amounts plus any new unpaid transactions during the period (2024-01-01 to 2024-01-28).\n   - From the given data, the new unpaid purchases are:\n     - Sale20240102005: 25,862.64 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - Sale20240103008: 116,350.08 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - Sale20240106022: 19,087.9 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - Sale20240107026: 72,420.34 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - Sale20240107027: 17,299.3 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - Sale20240109035: 8,585.48 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - Sale20240112045: 9,056.94 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - Sale20240113046: 37,955.74 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - Sale20240116061: 36,507.61 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - Sale20240116062: 113,277.99 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - Sale20240118070: 182,159.24 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - Sale20240120080: 186,634.74 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - Sale20240121085: 8,657.27 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - Sale20240122089: 93,377.7 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - Sale20240123094: 114,947.1 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - Sale20240124098: 17,284.38 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - Sale20240124099: 86,327.57 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - Sale20240124100: 9,014.45 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - Sale20240125105: 98,695.47 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - Sale20240127114: 268,474.8 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n     - Sale20240128118: 25,844.76 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n   - Sum of new unpaid amounts: \n     \\( 25,862.64 + 116,350.08 + 19,087.9 + 72,420.34 + 17,299.3 + 8,585.48 + 9,056.94 + 37,955.74 + 36,507.61 + 113,277.99 + 182,159.24 + 186,634.74 + 8,657.27 + 93,377.7 + 114,947.1 + 17,284.38 + 86,327.57 + 9,014.45 + 98,695.47 + 268,474.8 + 25,844.76 = 1,408,512.21 \\)\n   - Total final liabilities: \n     \\( 1,160,000.0 (initial) + 1,408,512.21 (new unpaid) = 2,568,512.21 \\)\n\n3. **Interest Receivables:**\n   - Interest receivables are also liabilities if they are unpaid.
