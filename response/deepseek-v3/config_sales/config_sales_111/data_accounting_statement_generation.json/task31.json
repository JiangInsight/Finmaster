Sum all these amounts:\n   (441.44 * 17) + (435.21 * 1) + (406.57652662 * 2) + (384.32652662 * 2) + (339.82652662 * 5) + (336.26652662 * 1) + (311.72566573 * 1)\n   \n   = (7504.48) + (435.21) + (813.15305324) + (768.65305324) + (1699.1326331) + (336.26652662) + (311.72566573)\n   \n   = 7504.48 + 435.21 = 7939.69\n   7939.69 + 813.15305324 = 8752.84305324\n   8752.84305324 + 768.65305324 = 9521.49610648\n   9521.49610648 + 1699.1326331 = 11220.62873958\n   11220.62873958 + 336.26652662 = 11556.8952662\n   11556.8952662 + 311.72566573 = 11868.62093193\n\n3. Round to 2 decimal places: 11868.62\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, it seems the interest income was calculated by summing all positive interest receivables (excluding any negative amounts, which didn't exist in the example). In this problem, all interest amounts are positive, so we can simply sum them all.\n\nBut let's verify the calculation more carefully:\n\nAdding all the amounts:\n441.44 + 441.44 + 441.44 + 435.21 + 435.21 + 435.21 + 435.21 + 435.21 + 435.21 + 435.21 + 435.21 + 435.21 + 435.21 + 435.21 + 435.21 + 435.21 + 435.21 + 406.57652662 + 406.57652662 + 384.32652662 + 384.32652662 + 339.82652662 + 339.82652662 + 339.82652662 + 339.82652662 + 339.82652662 + 336.26652662 + 311.72566573\n\nCalculating step by step:\n17 * 435.21 = 7398.57\nPlus the 3 higher amounts (441.44 is 6.23 more than 435.21, so 6.23 * 3 = 18.69)\n7398.57 + 18.69 = 7417.26\nPlus the remaining amounts:\n406.57652662 * 2 = 813.15305324\n384.32652662 * 2 = 768.65305324\n339.82652662 * 5 = 1699.1326331\n336.26652662 = 336.26652662\n311.72566573 = 311.72566573\n\nTotal = 7417.26 + 813.15305324 + 768.65305324 + 1699.1326331 + 336.26652662 + 311.72566573\n= 7417.26 + 813.15305324 = 8230.41305324\n+ 768.65305324 = 8999.06610648\n+ 1699.1326331 = 10698.19873958\n+ 336.26652662 = 11034.4652662\n+ 311.72566573 = 11346.19093193\n\nRounding to 2 decimal places: 11346.19\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with the example where the sum was much smaller. Maybe we should only count the daily interest amounts once per day (even though there are multiple transactions per day in the data).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should only sum the amounts where the type is exactly \"Interest Receivables\" (which is what we did initially). \n\nGiven that the example showed summing all interest receivables transactions, and all amounts here are positive, the correct sum is 11346.19.\n\nHowever, looking back at the example again, the solution was much smaller (2672.87), suggesting that perhaps only certain interest transactions should be counted. Maybe only those marked as \"Unpaid\" (which all are in this case), or perhaps only one per day.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and following the example's approach of summing all interest receivable amounts, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Interest Income': '11346.19'}}\n```",
