Sale20240125044 - Shows a discrepancy between original price (24990.50) and recorded price (24944.50)\n2. Sale20240120080 - Shows a discrepancy between original price (93317.37) and recorded price (109001.61)\n\nLet's focus on Sale20240120080 first since it has a larger discrepancy.\n\nLooking at the transaction details:\n- It's a sale of 2 units of Premium Product D\n- Recorded unit price: 109001.61\n- But the invoice mentions \"consisting of 2.0 units at a unit price of $93317.37\"\n- The total amount (186634.74) matches 2 * 93317.37\n- The tax amount (9331.74) is 5% of the total (which is correct)\n- The cost amount (100000) and profit (86634.74) also align with the original price\n\nThe inconsistency is clearly in the unit price field - it's recorded as 109001.61 but should be 93317.37 based on the invoice description and calculations.\n\nHere's the solution in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sale', 'Original date': '2024-01-20', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-20', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': '', 'Recorded payment_method': '', 'Original quantity': '2.0', 'Recorded quantity': '2.0', 'Original price': '93317.37', 'Recorded price': '109001.61', 'Original receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Original amount': '186634.74', 'Recorded amount': '186634.74', 'Original tax': '9331.74', 'Recorded tax': '9331.74', 'Original profit': '86634.74', 'Recorded profit': '86634.74', 'Original Preparer': '', 'Recorded Preparer': '', 'Original Approver': '', 'Recorded Approver': '', 'id': 'Sale20240120080'} }\n```\n\nThe key correction needed is the unit price field, which should be 93317.37 instead of 109001.61. All other fields appear to be consistent with this corrected price.",
