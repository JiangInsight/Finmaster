We are specifically interested in the depreciation entries.\n\n2. **Identify Depreciation Entries**: \n   - In the provided data, there is a single depreciation entry with the type \"Depreciation\" and an amount of 45748.43000000001 recorded on 2024-01-01.\n\n3. **Initial Accumulated Depreciation**: \n   - Since there are no depreciation entries before the initial date (2023-12-31), the initial accumulated depreciation is 0.00.\n\n4. **Final Accumulated Depreciation**: \n   - The depreciation entry on 2024-01-01 increases the accumulated depreciation by 45748.43. Since there are no other depreciation entries, the final accumulated depreciation is 45748.43.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accumulated Depreciation End Value': '45748.43'} }\n```",
