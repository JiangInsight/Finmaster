                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to calculate the initial and final values of non-current assets (property, plant, and equipment) based on the provided transactions data. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Initial Non-current Assets\nFrom the transactions data, we look for entries that represent the initial fixed assets. In the given data, there is an entry with type \"Fixed Assets\" on 2023-12-31 with an amount of 5,000,000.00. This is the initial value of non-current assets.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Fixed Asset Purchases\nNext, we look for transactions where fixed assets are purchased. These are entries with type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\". From the data, we find the following purchases:\n1. 256,859.19 (Processing Equipment4)\n2. 171,985.91 (Storage Facilities5)\n3. 55,577.41 (Production Line6)\n4. 117,840.57 (Production Line7)\n5. 73,932.79 (Production Line8)\n\nThe total of these purchases is:\n256,859.19 + 171,985.91 + 55,577.41 + 117,840.57 + 73,932.79 = 676,195.87\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Depreciation\nFrom the data, there is a depreciation entry on 2024-01-01 with an amount of 45,748.43. This reduces the value of the non-current assets.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Final Non-current Assets\nThe final value of non-current assets is calculated as:\nInitial Value + Fixed Asset Purchases - Depreciation\n= 5,000,000.00 + 676,195.87 - 45,748.43 = 5,630,447.44\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"5000000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"5630447.44\"}}\n```",
