Depreciation is typically recorded as an expense in the income statement and is listed under the \"type\" column in the transactions data.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We need to find the depreciation amount from the transactions data. This amount is usually recorded as a single entry with the type \"Depreciation\".\n\n2. **Review the Transactions Data**: Look through the transactions to find any entries where the \"type\" is \"Depreciation\". \n\n3. **Locate the Depreciation Entry**: In the provided data, there is an entry with the following details:\n   - **id**: `Depreciation20240101001`\n   - **type**: `Depreciation`\n   - **amount**: `45748.43000000001`\n   - **recorded_amount**: `45748.43000000001`\n\n4. **Extract the Depreciation Amount**: The depreciation amount is `45748.43000000001`. For consistency with the example provided, we can round this to two decimal places, resulting in `45748.43`.\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: Present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45748.43'} }\n```",
