These transactions represent the accounts payable that have not yet been settled in cash.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Unpaid Purchase Transactions with Payment Method \"Account Payable\":**\n   - We need to filter the transactions where:\n     - `type` is \"Purchase\"\n     - `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\"\n     - `payment_method` is \"Account Payable\"\n\n2. **Sum the Amounts of These Transactions:**\n   - The total of these unpaid purchase amounts will represent the increase in accounts payable.\n\n3. **Transactions Matching the Criteria:**\n   - From the given data, the following transactions meet the criteria:\n     - `Purchase20231231009`: Amount = 60,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231013`: Amount = 250,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231015`: Amount = 80,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231018`: Amount = 60,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n\n4. **Calculate Total Increase in Accounts Payable:**\n   - Total = 60,000.00 + 250,000.00 + 80,000.00 + 60,000.00 = 450,000.00\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '450000.00'} }\n```",
