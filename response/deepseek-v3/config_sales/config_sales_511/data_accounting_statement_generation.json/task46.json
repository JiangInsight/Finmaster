Fixed assets are not part of cash and cash equivalents, so they should be excluded from this calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Cash and Bank Deposits:**\n   - The initial transactions include:\n     - Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n     - Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n\n2. **Sum the Cash and Cash Equivalents:**\n   - Total cash and cash equivalents = Cash deposit + Bank deposit\n   - Total = 3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 = 8,000,000.0\n\n3. **Exclude Non-Cash Items:**\n   - Fixed assets (5,000,000.0) are not part of cash and cash equivalents, so they are not included in the calculation.\n\n4. **Final Beginning Balance:**\n   - The beginning balance of cash and cash equivalents is the sum of the initial cash and bank deposits, which is 8,000,000.0.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
