                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two ratios: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows how much gross profit a company makes from its sales. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   The result is expressed as a percentage.\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: This ratio measures a company's ability to cover its debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   Here, \"Total Debt\" can be considered as the \"Total Current Liabilities\" from the balance sheet since that represents the company's short-term obligations.\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Numbers\n\nLet's pull out the numbers we need from the provided financial statements.\n\n#### For Gross Profit Margin:\nFrom the **Income Statement**:\n- **Gross Profit**: 2,545,589.48\n- **Total Revenue**: 5,565,589.48\n\n#### For Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:\nFrom the **Cash Flow Statement**:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -81,548.37 (This is negative, which might indicate cash outflow)\n\nFrom the **Balance Sheet** (End of period):\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 728,279.50\n\n### Calculating the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,545,589.48}{5,565,589.48} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   Let's do the division first:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2,545,589.48}{5,565,589.48} \\approx 0.4574\n   \\]\n   Now, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n   \\[\n   0.4574 \\times 100 \\approx 45.74\\%\n   \\]\n   So, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **45.74%**.\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-81,548.37}{728,279.50}\n   \\]\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-81,548.37}{728,279.50} \\approx -0.112\n   \\]\n   So, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-0.112**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin**:\n  - 2,545,589.48 / 5,565,589.48 ≈ 0.4574 → 45.74% ✔️\n\n- **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n  - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is indeed -81,548.37.\n  - Total Current Liabilities are 728,279.50.\n  - -81,548.37 / 728,279.50 ≈ -0.112 ✔️\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating both ratios, here's the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '45.74%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.11'}}\n```\n\n*Note*: I rounded the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio to two decimal places for clarity, resulting in -0.11. The Gross Profit Margin is presented with two decimal places as well, at 45.74%.",
