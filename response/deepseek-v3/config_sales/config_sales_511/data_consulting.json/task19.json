                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Current Ratio and the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: This measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations with its current assets. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: This shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n\n- **Total Current Assets (End_amount)**: 9,193,203.41\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount)**: 728,279.50\n- **Inventory**:\n  - Initial_amount (Beginning Inventory): 0.00\n  - End_amount (Ending Inventory): 440,000.00\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 3,020,000.00\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{9,193,203.41}{728,279.50}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9,193,203.41}{728,279.50} \\approx 12.62\n\\]\n\nSo, the Current Ratio is approximately **12.62**.\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the Current Ratio was 4.27, which seems more typical. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the numbers.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Total Current Assets: 9,193,203.41\n- Total Current Liabilities: 728,279.50\n\nThe calculation seems correct. Maybe the example had higher liabilities relative to assets, making the ratio lower. Here, liabilities are relatively small compared to assets, leading to a higher ratio. So, 12.62 seems correct based on the given numbers.\n\n### Calculating the Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\nFirst, find the Average Inventory:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2} = \\frac{0.00 + 440,000.00}{2} = \\frac{440,000.00}{2} = 220,000.00\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} = \\frac{3,020,000.00}{220,000.00}\n\\]\n\nDoing the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3,020,000.00}{220,000.00} \\approx 13.73\n\\]\n\nSo, the Inventory Turnover Ratio is approximately **13.73**.\n\n*Again, comparing with the example where it was 1.73, this seems much higher. Maybe the COGS is higher relative to inventory here, or inventory is lower.*\n\nBut based on the numbers:\n\n- COGS: 3,020,000\n- Average Inventory: 220,000\n- Ratio: ~13.73\n\nThis seems correct mathematically.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nIn the example:\n\n- COGS: 4,410,000\n- Beginning Inventory: 0\n- Ending Inventory: 5,090,000\n- Average Inventory: (0 + 5,090,000)/2 = 2,545,000\n- Inventory Turnover: 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73\n\nThat checks out. In our problem:\n\n- COGS: 3,020,000\n- Average Inventory: 220,000\n- Ratio: ~13.73\n\nThis seems correct because inventory is much smaller relative to COGS here compared to the example.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating:\n\n- **Current Ratio**: 12.62\n- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: 13.73\n\nHowever, looking back at the example's format, the ratios were presented with two decimal places. So, I'll keep it as:\n\n- Current Ratio: 12.62\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio: 13.73\n\nBut let me check if the ratios should be rounded differently. The calculations seem precise enough to keep two decimal places.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '12.62', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '13.73'} }\n```\n\n*Wait, is the Inventory Turnover Ratio supposed to be that high? Let me think about the numbers again.*\n\nGiven:\n\n- Beginning Inventory: 0\n- Ending Inventory: 440,000\n- COGS: 3,020,000\n\nAverage Inventory: 220,000\n\nTurnover: 3,020,000 / 220,000 = 13.727... ≈ 13.73\n\nThis implies the inventory is being turned over roughly 13.73 times in the period, which is high but possible if inventory levels are low compared to sales (COGS). Maybe the company has a just-in-time inventory system or very fast turnover.\n\nAlternatively, if the \"Initial_amount\" for inventory is not zero but some other number, but the table shows 0.00 as initial. Unless there's a misinterpretation.\n\nBut based on the given data, the calculations seem correct.\n\n### Re-evaluating Initial Inventory\n\nIs it possible that the initial inventory is not zero? The table shows:\n\n| Inventory | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 440000.00 | 2024-01-27 |\n\nSo, beginning inventory is indeed 0, ending is 440,000. Maybe the company started with no inventory and purchased all during the period, leading to high turnover.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the entire inventory was purchased during the period, and COGS is based on that, perhaps the turnover is high because inventory was bought and sold quickly.\n\nBut mathematically, the calculation stands as:\n\nInventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory = 3,020,000 / 220,000 = 13.73\n\nUnless the average should be calculated differently, but standard is (beginning + ending)/2.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the calculated numbers.\n\n### Final Confirmation\n\nGiven no other information, and the data seems clear, the ratios are:\n\n- Current Ratio: 12.62\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio: 13.73\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '12.62', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '13.73'} }\n```",
