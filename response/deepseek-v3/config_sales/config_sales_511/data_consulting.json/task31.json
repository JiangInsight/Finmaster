                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand where each number comes from.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all sales are credit sales) = Main Business Revenue = 5,565,589.48\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable = 0.00 (from initial_amount in balance sheet)\n- Ending Accounts Receivable = 1,502,354.84\n\n**Average Accounts Receivable:**  \n= (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2  \n= (0 + 1,502,354.84) / 2  \n= 751,177.42\n\n**Calculation:**  \n= 5,565,589.48 / 751,177.42  \n≈ 7.41\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\n**Given:**\n- Operating Cash Flow = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -81,548.37\n- Current Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 728,279.50\n\n**Calculation:**  \n= -81,548.37 / 728,279.50  \n≈ -0.11\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis seems similar to the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. Typically, both terms can refer to the same calculation where operating cash flow is divided by current liabilities. \n\nGiven that, it would be the same as above:\n= -0.11\n\nBut sometimes, \"Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\" might use average current liabilities. Let's check if initial current liabilities are given.\n\nInitial Current Liabilities = 0.00 (from initial_amount in balance sheet)\nEnding Current Liabilities = 728,279.50\n\nAverage Current Liabilities = (0 + 728,279.50) / 2 = 364,139.75\n\nThen:\n= -81,548.37 / 364,139.75  \n≈ -0.22\n\nGiven the example provided seems to have both ratios the same, I'll assume they're the same calculation unless specified otherwise. So both could be -0.11.\n\nBut looking back at the example, the operating cash flow ratio and operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio were the same (-3.90), suggesting they used the same denominator (current liabilities at the end). So I'll stick with -0.11 for both.\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Sales = Total Revenue = 5,565,589.48\n- Initial Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets = 14,823,650.85\n\n**Average Total Assets:**  \n= (13,000,000.00 + 14,823,650.85) / 2  \n= 27,823,650.85 / 2  \n= 13,911,825.425\n\n**Calculation:**  \n= 5,565,589.48 / 13,911,825.425  \n≈ 0.40\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\n**Given:**\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no non-current liabilities are listed) = 728,279.50\n- Total Shareholders' Equity = Total Owner's Equity = 14,095,371.35\n\n**Calculation:**  \n= 728,279.50 / 14,095,371.35  \n≈ 0.052\n\nBut looking at the example, their debt to equity was total liabilities (current) / total equity, which was 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.16.\n\nSimilarly here, it's 728,279.50 / 14,095,371.35 ≈ 0.052, but maybe they consider more liabilities. Here, only current liabilities are present, so it's 0.05.\n\nBut in the example, they might have included other liabilities if present. Here, only current liabilities are listed, so it's just that.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.41', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-0.11', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.11', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.40', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me double-check the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio since it's higher than the example's 4.47, but here sales are higher relative to AR.\n\nNet Sales = 5,565,589.48  \nAverage AR = 751,177.42  \nRatio = 5,565,589.48 / 751,177.42 ≈ 7.41 ✔\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio: -81,548.37 / 728,279.50 ≈ -0.11 ✔\n\nTotal Asset Turnover: 5,565,589.48 / 13,911,825.425 ≈ 0.40 ✔\n\nDebt to Equity: 728,279.50 / 14,095,371.35 ≈ 0.05 ✔\n\nEverything checks out!",
