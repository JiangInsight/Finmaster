                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -81,548.37\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 728,279.50\n\nCalculation:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -81,548.37 / 728,279.50 ≈ -0.11\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFirst, we need to determine Total Debt. From the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since there are no non-current liabilities listed) = 728,279.50\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -81,548.37 / 728,279.50 ≈ -0.11\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio was the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. That suggests that in the example, \"Debt\" was considered as Current Liabilities. Maybe the company has no long-term debt, so Total Debt = Current Liabilities. That seems to be the case here as well, so both ratios are the same.\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:** Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 3,020,000.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Ending Inventory = 440,000.00\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00 (assuming, since it's not given, but likely started at 0 based on the initial amounts)\n\nAverage Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2 = (0 + 440,000) / 2 = 220,000\n\nCalculation:\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 3,020,000 / 220,000 ≈ 13.73\n\n*Hmm*, in the example, the ratio was much lower (1.73). Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the initial inventory. The initial balance sheet shows Inventory initial_amount as 0, and end_amount as 440,000. So average is indeed 220,000. Maybe the COGS is lower in the example, making the ratio lower. Here, COGS is higher relative to inventory, so higher turnover seems correct.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Debt / Total Equity\n\nTotal Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 728,279.50 (no long-term debt)\nTotal Equity = Total Owner's Equity (end amount) = 14,095,371.35\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 728,279.50 / 14,095,371.35 ≈ 0.052\n\n*In the example, it was 0.16, which is higher. Here, debt is lower relative to equity, so a lower ratio makes sense.*\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:** (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 9,193,203.41\n- Inventory = 440,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 728,279.50\n\nQuick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 9,193,203.41 - 440,000 = 8,753,203.41\n\nCalculation:\nQuick Ratio = 8,753,203.41 / 728,279.50 ≈ 12.02\n\n*This seems very high compared to the example's 1.54. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the components: Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable = 4,303,451.63 + 2,938,804.13 + 8,592.81 + 1,502,354.84 = 8,753,203.41. That matches Total Current Assets - Inventory. So the calculation seems correct. Maybe this company has a lot of liquid assets relative to liabilities.*\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nCurrent Assets = 9,193,203.41\nCurrent Liabilities = 728,279.50\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 9,193,203.41 / 728,279.50 ≈ 12.62\n\n*Again, this is much higher than the example's 4.27, but the numbers seem correct based on the given data.*\n\n### Reviewing the Calculations:\nLooking back, the numbers seem correct based on the provided data. The company in this problem appears to have:\n- Very high current assets relative to current liabilities (hence high quick and current ratios).\n- Low debt compared to equity (low debt to equity ratio).\n- High inventory turnover (lots of sales relative to inventory).\n- Negative operating cash flow relative to current liabilities, leading to negative operating cash flow and cash flow to debt ratios.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.11', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.11', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '13.73', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05', 'Quick Ratio': '12.02', 'Current Ratio': '12.62'}}\n```\n\n*Note: The ratios are rounded to two decimal places as in the example. Some ratios like Quick and Current are unusually high, but the calculations follow the given data accurately.*",
