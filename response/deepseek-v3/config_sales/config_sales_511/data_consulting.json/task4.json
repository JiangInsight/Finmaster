In this case, it's the \"Total Current Liabilities\" because there are no non-current liabilities listed.\n   - Total Current Liabilities = 728,279.50\n\n2. **Identify Total Owner's Equity**: This is already provided in the balance sheet.\n   - Total Owner's Equity = 14,095,371.35\n\n3. **Calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio**: The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the numbers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{728,279.50}{14,095,371.35} \\approx 0.0517\n   \\]\n   Rounding to two decimal places, the ratio is 0.05.\n\n4. **Present the Solution**: The final answer is rounded to two decimal places for clarity.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05'} }\n```",
