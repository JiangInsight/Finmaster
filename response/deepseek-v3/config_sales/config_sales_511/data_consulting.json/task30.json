                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio one by one using the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 9,193,203.41\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 728,279.50\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 9,193,203.41 / 728,279.50 ≈ 12.62\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities\n\nAssuming Cash and Cash Equivalents include:\n- Cash on Hand = 4,303,451.63\n- Bank Deposits = 2,938,804.13\n- Interest Receivable = 8,592.81\n- Accounts Receivable = 1,502,354.84\n\nQuick Assets = 4,303,451.63 + 2,938,804.13 + 8,592.81 + 1,502,354.84 = 8,753,203.41\n\nQuick Ratio = 8,753,203.41 / 728,279.50 ≈ 12.02\n\n*Wait a minute, this seems too high compared to the Current Ratio. Maybe Quick Assets should exclude Inventory but include other current assets that are quickly convertible to cash. Here, Inventory is 440,000, which is already excluded in the above sum. So the calculation seems correct.*\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\nTotal Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 728,279.50 (since there are no non-current liabilities listed)\nTotal Assets = 14,823,650.85\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 728,279.50 / 14,823,650.85 ≈ 0.049 or 0.05\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nTotal Liabilities = 728,279.50\nTotal Owner's Equity = 14,095,371.35\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 728,279.50 / 14,095,371.35 ≈ 0.052 or 0.05\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nOperating Cash Flow = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -81,548.37\nTotal Debt = Total Liabilities = 728,279.50\n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -81,548.37 / 728,279.50 ≈ -0.112 or -0.11\n\n*This negative ratio indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative relative to its debt, which could be a concern.*\n\n### Verifying Calculations:\nLet me double-check the components:\n\n- **Current Ratio:** 9,193,203.41 / 728,279.50 = 12.62 (correct)\n- **Quick Ratio:** (4,303,451.63 + 2,938,804.13 + 8,592.81 + 1,502,354.84) / 728,279.50 = 8,753,203.41 / 728,279.50 ≈ 12.02 (correct, as Inventory is excluded)\n- **Debt to Asset:** 728,279.50 / 14,823,650.85 ≈ 0.049 (correct)\n- **Debt to Equity:** 728,279.50 / 14,095,371.35 ≈ 0.052 (correct)\n- **Cash Flow to Debt:** -81,548.37 / 728,279.50 ≈ -0.112 (correct)\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '12.62', 'Quick Ratio': '12.02', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.05', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.11'}}\n```\n\n*Note: The Quick Ratio seems unusually high compared to the Current Ratio, which suggests that most current assets are already quick assets (excluding a small inventory). This might be correct given the data, but it's worth verifying if all quick assets are correctly included.*",
