                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'll go through each ratio one by one, explaining how I arrive at the numbers.\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets (End_amount) = 9,193,203.41\n- Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 728,279.50\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 9,193,203.41 / 728,279.50 ≈ 12.62\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n**Definition:** Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 2,545,589.48\n- Total Revenue = 5,565,589.48\n\nCalculation:\nGross Profit Margin = (2,545,589.48 / 5,565,589.48) * 100 ≈ 45.74%\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Definition:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 728,279.50\n- Total Assets = 14,823,650.85\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 728,279.50 / 14,823,650.85 ≈ 0.049 or 4.91%\n\nWait a minute, in the example, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated using Total Current Liabilities over Total Assets, but typically, it's Total Liabilities (which includes both current and non-current liabilities). Here, only current liabilities are present, so it's just that.\n\nBut looking back at the example, their Debt to Asset Ratio was 0.14, which was Total Current Liabilities / Total Assets (1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.14). So, following that:\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 728,279.50 / 14,823,650.85 ≈ 0.049 or 4.91%\n\nBut the example had it as a decimal, not percentage, so 0.049.\n\n### 4. Net Profit Margin\n**Definition:** Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1,095,371.35\n- Total Revenue = 5,565,589.48\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (1,095,371.35 / 5,565,589.48) * 100 ≈ 19.68%\n\n### 5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** Cash to Current Debt Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 4,303,451.63\n- Bank Deposits = 2,938,804.13\n- Current Liabilities = 728,279.50\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits = 4,303,451.63 + 2,938,804.13 = 7,242,255.76\n\nCalculation:\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = 7,242,255.76 / 728,279.50 ≈ 9.94\n\n### 6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n**Definition:** Free Cash Flow = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -81,548.37\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (Capital Expenditures) = 676,195.87\n\nBut typically, FCF is Net Cash from Operating Activities minus Capital Expenditures, but here Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is already after changes in working capital, etc.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes FCF is considered as the net increase in cash and equivalents, which is given as -757,744.24.\n\nLooking at the example, their FCF was the \"Net Increase\" in cash and equivalents, which was -7,565,348.53.\n\nSo, following that:\nFree Cash Flow = Net Increase = -757,744.24\n\n### 7. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Definition:** ROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1,095,371.35\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets = 14,823,650.85\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (1,095,371.35 / 14,823,650.85) * 100 ≈ 7.39%\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '12.62', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.74%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.05', 'Net Profit Margin': '19.68%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '9.94', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-757744.24', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '7.39%'}}\n```\n\n### Verification:\n\nLet me quickly verify some calculations:\n\n1. Current Ratio: 9,193,203.41 / 728,279.50 = 12.62 ✔\n2. Gross Profit Margin: 2,545,589.48 / 5,565,589.48 = 0.4574 → 45.74% ✔\n3. Debt to Asset: 728,279.50 / 14,823,650.85 ≈ 0.049 → 0.05 ✔\n4. Net Profit Margin: 1,095,371.35 / 5,565,589.48 ≈ 0.1968 → 19.68% ✔\n5. Cash to Current Debt: 7,242,255.76 / 728,279.50 ≈ 9.94 ✔\n6. FCF: Net Increase is -757,744.24 ✔\n7. ROA: 1,095,371.35 / 14,823,650.85 ≈ 0.0739 → 7.39% ✔\n\nEverything checks out!",
