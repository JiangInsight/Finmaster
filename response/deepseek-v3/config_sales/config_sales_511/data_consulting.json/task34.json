                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through them step by step, explaining how to calculate each one based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -81,548.37\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 728,279.50\n\n**Calculation:**  \n-81,548.37 / 728,279.50 ≈ -0.11\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 728,279.50 (this is the only liability, so total debt is this)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,095,371.35\n\n**Calculation:**  \n728,279.50 / 14,095,371.35 ≈ 0.052 (rounded to 0.05)\n\n*Wait a minute, in the example, the Debt to Equity Ratio was calculated using Total Current Liabilities as debt, but usually, Debt to Equity includes all liabilities (current and non-current). Here, there are no non-current liabilities listed, so it's just current liabilities. So, 728,279.50 / 14,095,371.35 ≈ 0.05.*\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 5,565,589.48\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets = 14,823,650.85\n- Average Total Assets = (13,000,000 + 14,823,650.85) / 2 = 13,911,825.425\n\n**Calculation:**  \n5,565,589.48 / 13,911,825.425 ≈ 0.40\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 9,193,203.41\n- Inventory = 440,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 728,279.50\n\n**Calculation:**  \n(9,193,203.41 - 440,000) / 728,279.50 = 8,753,203.41 / 728,279.50 ≈ 12.02\n\n*Hmm, this seems quite high. Let me double-check the components of current assets: Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, Accounts Receivable, Inventory. So, quick assets are Cash + Bank + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable = 4,303,451.63 + 2,938,804.13 + 8,592.81 + 1,502,354.84 = 8,753,203.41. Yes, that's correct. So, 8,753,203.41 / 728,279.50 ≈ 12.02.*\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio, which we already calculated as -0.11.\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Income / Average Shareholder's Equity\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = 1,095,371.35\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Owner's Equity = 13,000,000.00\n- End Total Owner's Equity = 14,095,371.35\n- Average Equity = (13,000,000 + 14,095,371.35) / 2 = 13,547,685.675\n\n**Calculation:**  \n1,095,371.35 / 13,547,685.675 ≈ 0.0809 or 8.09%\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since no info is given otherwise):\n- Net Sales = 5,565,589.48\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00\n- End Accounts Receivable = 1,502,354.84\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 1,502,354.84) / 2 = 751,177.42\n\n**Calculation:**  \n5,565,589.48 / 751,177.42 ≈ 7.41\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.11', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.40', 'Quick Ratio': '12.02', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.11', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '8.09%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.41'}}\n```\n\n*Wait, comparing with the example, some ratios seem quite different, especially the Quick Ratio. Maybe I missed something. Let me recheck Quick Ratio components.*\n\nRechecking Quick Ratio:\nCurrent Assets = 9,193,203.41  \nInventory = 440,000  \nQuick Assets = 9,193,203.41 - 440,000 = 8,753,203.41  \nCurrent Liabilities = 728,279.50  \nQuick Ratio = 8,753,203.41 / 728,279.50 ≈ 12.02  \n\nThis seems correct based on the numbers provided. Maybe the company has a very high amount of cash and receivables compared to liabilities, leading to a high quick ratio.\n\nSimilarly, Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities is negative because operating cash flow is negative, which makes sense given the cash flow statement shows a net outflow from operations.\n\nEverything else seems correctly calculated based on the formulas and given data. \n\nFinal answer remains:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.11', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.40', 'Quick Ratio': '12.02', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.11', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '8.09%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.41'}}\n```",
