                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Asset Ratio, the Gross Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 728,279.50\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 728,279.50\n- **Total Assets (End_amount):** 14,823,650.85\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{728,279.50}{14,823,650.85} \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{728,279.50}{14,823,650.85} \\approx 0.0491 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.049 or 4.91%. However, looking at the example provided, the ratio was given as a simple decimal without percentage, so we'll present it as '0.05' (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nWait, let's check the example:\nIn the example, Total Current Liabilities = 1,861,550.92, Total Assets = 13,216,409.49\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 â‰ˆ 0.1409, presented as '0.14'\n\nSimilarly, here it's 0.049, so '0.05' seems appropriate.\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 2,545,589.48\n- **Total Revenue:** 5,565,589.48\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,545,589.48}{5,565,589.48} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nLet's compute:\n\\[ \\frac{2,545,589.48}{5,565,589.48} \\approx 0.4574 \\]\n\\[ 0.4574 \\times 100\\% \\approx 45.74\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately 45.74%.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -81,548.37 (negative value)\n- From the balance sheet:\n  - **Total Current Liabilities:** 728,279.50\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-81,548.37}{728,279.50} \\]\n\nLet's compute:\n\\[ \\frac{-81,548.37}{728,279.50} \\approx -0.112 \\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately -0.11.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.05', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.74%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.11'} }\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the Gross Profit Margin was given with two decimal places ('18.80%'), and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio was given with two decimal places ('-3.90'). Maybe we should round to two decimal places for consistency.\n\n- Gross Profit Margin: 45.74% (already two decimal places)\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -0.11 (could be -0.11 or -0.112, but -0.11 seems sufficient)\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio is 0.049, so 0.05 is correct to two decimal places.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.05', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.74%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.11'} }\n```\n\nBut wait, in the example, Operating Cash Flow Ratio was -3.90, which seems like it might be scaled differently. Maybe it's Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities divided by Current Liabilities without any scaling, and -81,548.37 / 728,279.50 is indeed -0.11, so that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Operating Cash Flow Ratio in the example was Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities divided by something else, but based on standard definitions, it's usually operating cash flow / current liabilities.\n\nGiven that, our calculation seems correct.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.05', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.74%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.11'} }\n```",
