                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Equity Ratio, the Net Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities listed):** 728,279.50\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 14,095,371.35\n\nWait a minute, in the balance sheet, under liabilities, there's only \"Total Current Liabilities\" listed as 728,279.50. There are no non-current liabilities mentioned. So, total liabilities are just the current liabilities here.\n\nSo,\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{728,279.50}{14,095,371.35} \\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n728,279.50 / 14,095,371.35 ≈ 0.0517\n\nSo, approximately 0.05 when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nBut looking at the example provided, their Debt to Equity Ratio was 0.16, which is higher, and their liabilities were also higher relative to equity. So, this seems plausible.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** 1,095,371.35\n- **Total Revenue:** 5,565,589.48\n\nSo,\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,095,371.35}{5,565,589.48} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n1,095,371.35 / 5,565,589.48 ≈ 0.1968\n\nMultiply by 100%: 19.68%\n\nSo, approximately 19.68%.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -81,548.37\n- **Total Current Liabilities (from balance sheet):** 728,279.50\n\nSo,\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{-81,548.37}{728,279.50} \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n-81,548.37 / 728,279.50 ≈ -0.112\n\nSo, approximately -0.11.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all these:\n\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.05\n- Net Profit Margin: 19.68%\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: -0.11\n\nBut looking at the example, they presented the ratios with two decimal places for Debt to Equity and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities, and Net Profit Margin as a percentage with two decimal places. So, let's format similarly:\n\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: '0.05'\n- Net Profit Margin: '19.68%'\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: '-0.11'\n\nHowever, the example had Net Profit Margin with a negative value and two decimal places ('-30.29%'), so maybe we should keep two decimal places even if the second is zero. For consistency:\n\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: '0.05' (already two decimal places)\n- Net Profit Margin: '19.68%' (two decimal places)\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: '-0.11' (two decimal places)\n\nBut actually, 0.05 is one decimal place; to have two, it's 0.05. Similarly, -0.11 is two decimal places. So, this seems correct.\n\nHere's the final JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05', 'Net Profit Margin': '19.68%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.11'}}\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify the calculations to ensure no mistakes.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - Total Liabilities: 728,279.50\n   - Total Equity: 14,095,371.35\n   - Ratio: 728,279.50 / 14,095,371.35 ≈ 0.0517 → '0.05' (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - Net Profit: 1,095,371.35\n   - Revenue: 5,565,589.48\n   - (1,095,371.35 / 5,565,589.48) * 100 ≈ 19.68%\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -81,548.37\n   - Current Liabilities: 728,279.50\n   - -81,548.37 / 728,279.50 ≈ -0.112 → '-0.11' (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05', 'Net Profit Margin': '19.68%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.11'}}\n```",
