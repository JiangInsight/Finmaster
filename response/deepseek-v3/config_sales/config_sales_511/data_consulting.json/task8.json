                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio based on the given cash flow statement. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's understand what the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is. This ratio compares the cash generated from operating activities to the net income reported by the company. It's a measure of how well a company's net income is being converted into actual cash flow from operations.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit (Net Income)}} \\]\n\nFrom the given data, we have:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -81,548.37\n- Net Profit: 1,095,371.35\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nNow, let's plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-81,548.37}{1,095,371.35} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-81,548.37}{1,095,371.35} \\approx -0.07445 \\]\n\nNow, we need to present this ratio in a readable format, typically rounded to two decimal places. \n\nRounding -0.07445 to two decimal places gives us -0.07.\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the ratio was given as '4.41', which is a positive number. This makes me think that perhaps we should take the absolute value of the ratio or ensure that the signs are correctly interpreted.\n\nBut in our case, both the numerator (Operating Cash Flow) and the denominator (Net Income) have opposite signs: Operating Cash Flow is negative, and Net Income is positive. This results in a negative ratio, which might indicate that the company's operating cash flow is negative despite having positive net income, possibly due to significant non-cash expenses or changes in working capital.\n\nGiven that, the negative sign is meaningful here, indicating that the operating cash flow is moving in the opposite direction to net income.\n\nBut let's double-check the numbers to ensure we're interpreting them correctly.\n\n### Verifying the Numbers\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- Net Profit (Net Income): 1,095,371.35 (positive)\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -81,548.37 (negative)\n\nThis seems correct. The ratio is indeed negative based on these figures.\n\nHowever, in financial analysis, sometimes ratios are presented as absolute values or in a way that makes more intuitive sense. But since the example had a positive ratio where both numbers were negative (Net Profit was -1,645,141.43 and Operating Cash Flow was -7,259,994.10, resulting in a positive ratio), it seems the sign is preserved based on the actual values.\n\nIn our case, one is positive, and the other is negative, leading to a negative ratio. That seems mathematically correct.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nSo, the ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-81,548.37}{1,095,371.35} \\approx -0.07445 \\]\n\nRounded to two decimal places: -0.07\n\nBut looking at the example's presentation, it seems they might have taken the absolute value or perhaps the ratio is always presented positively. However, given that in the example both numbers were negative, leading to a positive ratio, and here we have opposite signs, the negative seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in identifying which number is the numerator and denominator. Maybe it's Net Income / Operating Cash Flow? \n\nLet me check the formula again.\n\nUpon checking, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is indeed Operating Cash Flow divided by Net Income, not the other way around. So our initial approach seems correct.\n\nGiven that, the answer is -0.07.\n\nBut the example had '4.41', which is positive, and their numbers were:\n\nOperating Cash Flow: -7,259,994.10\n\nNet Income: -1,645,141.43\n\nRatio: -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41\n\nSo negative divided by negative is positive, which makes sense.\n\nIn our case, negative divided by positive is negative, so -0.07 seems correct.\n\n### Presenting the Answer\n\nTherefore, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is -0.07.\n\nIn the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.07'} }\n```\n\n### Double-Checking\n\nJust to be thorough, let's list out the numbers:\n\n- Net Profit (Net Income): 1,095,371.35\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -81,548.37\n\nRatio = Operating Cash Flow / Net Income = -81,548.37 / 1,095,371.35 ≈ -0.07445 ≈ -0.07\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully going through the calculations and verifying the formula, the correct ratio is -0.07.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.07'} }\n```",
