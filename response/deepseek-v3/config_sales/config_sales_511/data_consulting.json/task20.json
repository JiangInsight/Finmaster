                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial task step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Gross Profit Margin and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods and services.\n   \n   **Formula**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**: This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It indicates the company's short-term liquidity.\n   \n   **Formula**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the **Income Statement**:\n- Total Revenue: \\$5,565,589.48\n- Cost of Goods Sold: \\$3,020,000.00\n- Gross Profit: \\$2,545,589.48\n\nFrom the **Cash Flow Statement**:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$81,548.37\n\nFrom the **Balance Sheet**:\n- Total Current Liabilities: \\$728,279.50\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,545,589.48}{5,565,589.48} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nCalculating the division first:\n\\[\n\\frac{2,545,589.48}{5,565,589.48} \\approx 0.4574\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\\[\n0.4574 \\times 100 \\approx 45.74\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **45.74%**.\n\n### Calculating Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-81,548.37}{728,279.50}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{-81,548.37}{728,279.50} \\approx -0.112\n\\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately **-0.11**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit: \\$2,545,589.48\n   - Total Revenue: \\$5,565,589.48\n   - \\$2,545,589.48 / \\$5,565,589.48 ≈ 0.4574 → 45.74%\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$81,548.37\n   - Total Current Liabilities: \\$728,279.50\n   - -\\$81,548.37 / \\$728,279.50 ≈ -0.112\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '45.74%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.11'} }\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- The Gross Profit Margin of 45.74% indicates that the company retains about 45.74 cents from each dollar of revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This is a healthy margin, suggesting good control over production costs relative to sales.\n  \n- The Operating Cash Flow Ratio of -0.11 is negative, which means the company's operating activities are not generating enough cash to cover its current liabilities. This could be a concern for short-term liquidity unless there are other sources of cash or the negative cash flow is temporary (e.g., due to significant investments in inventory or receivables that will convert to cash soon).\n\nWould you like me to explain any part in more detail?",
