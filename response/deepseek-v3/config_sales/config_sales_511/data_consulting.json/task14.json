In this case, it is **5,565,589.48**.\n\n2. **Determine Average Accounts Receivable**: \n   - The initial Accounts Receivable (from the balance sheet at the start of the period) is **0.00**.\n   - The ending Accounts Receivable (from the balance sheet at the end of the period) is **1,502,354.84**.\n   - The average is calculated as: (Initial + Ending) / 2 = (0.00 + 1,502,354.84) / 2 = **751,177.42**.\n\n3. **Calculate the Ratio**:\n   - The formula is: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable.\n   - Plugging in the numbers: 5,565,589.48 / 751,177.42 â‰ˆ **7.41**.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is **7.41**.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.41'}}\n```",
