                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: Return on Equity (ROE), Debt to Asset Ratio, and Gross Profit Margin. \n\n### 1. Understanding the Ratios\n\n**a. Return on Equity (ROE):**\nThis measures how effectively a company is using its shareholders' equity to generate profit. The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Shareholder's Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n\n**b. Debt to Asset Ratio:**\nThis indicates the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**c. Gross Profit Margin:**\nThis shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\n### 2. Extracting the Necessary Figures from the Financial Statements\n\nLet's go through each statement to find the numbers we need.\n\n**a. Income Statement:**\n- Net Profit: 1,095,371.35 (given at the bottom)\n- Total Revenue: 5,565,589.48\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 3,020,000.00\n- Gross Profit: 2,545,589.48 (already calculated as Total Revenue - COGS)\n\n**b. Balance Sheet (End of Period):**\n- Total Assets: 14,823,650.85\n- Total Liabilities: \n  - From the balance sheet, under \"Total Current Liabilities\": 728,279.50\n  - There's no mention of long-term liabilities, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 728,279.50\n- Total Owner's Equity: 14,095,371.35\n\nWait a minute, let's verify the Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity to ensure they add up to Total Assets.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities: 728,279.50\n- Paid-in Capital: 13,000,000.00\n- Retained Earnings: 1,095,371.35\n- Total Owner's Equity: 14,095,371.35\n- Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity: 728,279.50 + 14,095,371.35 = 14,823,650.85, which matches Total Assets. So, no long-term liabilities are present.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratios\n\n**a. Return on Equity (ROE):**\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Shareholder's Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{1,095,371.35}{14,095,371.35} \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n1,095,371.35 / 14,095,371.35 ≈ 0.0777\nMultiply by 100: 0.0777 * 100 ≈ 7.77%\n\n**b. Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{728,279.50}{14,823,650.85} \\]\n\nCalculating:\n728,279.50 / 14,823,650.85 ≈ 0.0491\n\n**c. Gross Profit Margin:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{2,545,589.48}{5,565,589.48} \\times 100 \\]\n\nCalculating:\n2,545,589.48 / 5,565,589.48 ≈ 0.4574\nMultiply by 100: 0.4574 * 100 ≈ 45.74%\n\n### 4. Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check each calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n**a. ROE:**\n1,095,371.35 / 14,095,371.35 ≈ 0.0777 → 7.77% ✔\n\n**b. Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n728,279.50 / 14,823,650.85 ≈ 0.0491 ✔\n\n**c. Gross Profit Margin:**\n2,545,589.48 / 5,565,589.48 ≈ 0.4574 → 45.74% ✔\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### 5. Final Answer\n\nNow, let's present the final answer in the required JSON format with the ratios rounded to two decimal places as percentages or decimal numbers as appropriate.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '7.77%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.05', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.74%'} }\n```\n\n**Explanation of Formatting:**\n- ROE is expressed as a percentage with two decimal places.\n- Debt to Asset Ratio is typically expressed as a decimal to two places, so 0.05 (not 5%).\n- Gross Profit Margin is a percentage with two decimal places.\n\nThis matches the example provided where percentages were used for ROE and Gross Profit Margin, and a decimal for Debt to Asset Ratio.",
