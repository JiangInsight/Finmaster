                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio one by one to ensure I understand how to compute them correctly.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities listed): 728,279.50\n- Total Assets: 14,823,650.85\n\nWait a minute, in the balance sheet, under \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity,\" it's listed as 14,823,650.85, which matches the Total Assets. But the liabilities are only the \"Total Current Liabilities\" of 728,279.50. There's no mention of long-term liabilities, so it seems that's all the debt the company has.\n\nSo, Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 728,279.50\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{728,279.50}{14,823,650.85} \\]\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n728,279.50 / 14,823,650.85 ≈ 0.0491\n\nSo, approximately 0.049 or 4.91%.\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the ratio was given as '0.14', which is a decimal, not a percentage. So, it seems we're expected to present it as a decimal.\n\nSo, '0.05' would be more accurate here (rounding to two decimal places).\n\nWait, let's check the calculation more precisely:\n\n728,279.50 / 14,823,650.85 ≈ 0.04913\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.05\n\nBut in the example, it was '0.14', which is higher. Maybe I'm missing some liabilities. Let me check the balance sheet again.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet:\n\n- Accounts Payable: 450,000.00\n- Taxes Payable: 278,279.50\n- Total Current Liabilities: 728,279.50\n\nThat's it. No other liabilities are listed. So, total liabilities are indeed 728,279.50.\n\nPerhaps the example had more liabilities, but here it's just current liabilities. So, 0.05 seems correct.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operating activities to the net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -81,548.37\n- Net Profit (which is Net Income): 1,095,371.35\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-81,548.37}{1,095,371.35} \\]\n\nThis gives a negative number, which is approximately -0.0745.\n\nBut in the example provided, the ratio was '4.41', which is positive and greater than 1. Here, we have a negative operating cash flow and positive net income, leading to a negative ratio. \n\nThis seems unusual because typically, operating cash flow is higher than net income due to add-backs like depreciation. Maybe there's a mistake in interpreting the cash flow statement.\n\nWait, let's look at the cash flow statement components:\n\nNet Profit: 1,095,371.35\nDepreciation: 45,748.43\n(Increase) in Accounts Receivable: -1,502,354.84\n(Increase) in Interest Receivable: -8,592.81\n(Increase) in Inventory: -440,000.00\nIncrease in Accounts Payable: 450,000.00\nIncrease in Tax Payable: 278,279.50\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -81,548.37\n\nThis seems correct based on the additions and subtractions:\n\n1,095,371.35 (Net Profit)\n+ 45,748.43 (Depreciation)\n- 1,502,354.84 (Increase in AR)\n- 8,592.81 (Increase in Interest Receivable)\n- 440,000.00 (Increase in Inventory)\n+ 450,000.00 (Increase in AP)\n+ 278,279.50 (Increase in Tax Payable)\n= -81,548.37\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct. \n\nBut the ratio is negative, which is unusual. Maybe we take the absolute value? Or perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the ratio is defined as Operating Cash Flow divided by Net Income, where Operating Cash Flow is before changes in working capital. But here, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities already includes changes in working capital.\n\nGiven that, and based on the example where they used the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities directly, I think we should stick with -0.07.\n\nBut the example had a positive ratio. Maybe in this case, since the ratio is negative, we can present it as such or consider if there's an error in the data.\n\nGiven that, and since the example showed a positive ratio even when Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities was negative (-7,259,994.10) and Net Profit was negative (-1,645,141.43), leading to a positive ratio (since negative divided by negative is positive), here we have negative divided by positive, which is negative.\n\nSo, the correct ratio is -0.07.\n\nBut the example had '4.41', which is -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41.\n\nSimilarly here: -81,548.37 / 1,095,371.35 ≈ -0.07\n\nSo, the ratio is negative.\n\nPerhaps we present it as '-0.07'.\n\nBut the example had two decimal places, so maybe '-0.07'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is always presented as positive, and the sign indicates the relationship. But mathematically, it's negative here.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is '-0.07'.\n\nBut let me think if there's another way to interpret Operating Cash Flow.\n\nSometimes, Operating Cash Flow is Net Income + Depreciation + other non-cash items, excluding changes in working capital. But here, the statement seems to include changes in working capital in Operating Cash Flow.\n\nGiven that, and following the example's method, it seems we should take the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities as is.\n\nSo, the ratio is -0.07.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.05', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.07'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. Debt to Asset Ratio:\n   - Total Liabilities: 728,279.50\n   - Total Assets: 14,823,650.85\n   - Ratio: 728,279.50 / 14,823,650.85 ≈ 0.049 → '0.05'\n\n2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -81,548.37\n   - Net Income: 1,095,371.35\n   - Ratio: -81,548.37 / 1,095,371.35 ≈ -0.074 → '-0.07'\n\nThis seems correct based on the given data and the example provided.",
