                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate the Quick Ratio and the Net Profit Margin based on the provided financial statements. \n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\n**Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):**\nThis measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\nWhere:\n- Quick Assets = Cash + Cash Equivalents + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable\n- Current Liabilities = Short-term debts and obligations due within a year\n\n**Net Profit Margin:**\nThis shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Cash on Hand (End_amount):** 4,303,451.63\n- **Bank Deposits (End_amount):** 2,938,804.13\n- **Interest Receivable (End_amount):** 8,592.81\n- **Accounts Receivable (End_amount):** 1,502,354.84\n- **Inventory (End_amount):** 440,000.00\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 728,279.50\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** 1,095,371.35\n- **Total Revenue:** 5,565,589.48\n\n### Calculating Quick Ratio\n\nFirst, identify the quick assets. These are the most liquid assets excluding inventory:\n- Cash on Hand: 4,303,451.63\n- Bank Deposits: 2,938,804.13\n- Interest Receivable: 8,592.81\n- Accounts Receivable: 1,502,354.84\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 4,303,451.63 + 2,938,804.13 + 8,592.81 + 1,502,354.84\n= 4,303,451.63 + 2,938,804.13 = 7,242,255.76\n+ 8,592.81 = 7,250,848.57\n+ 1,502,354.84 = 8,753,203.41\n\nCurrent Liabilities = 728,279.50\n\nQuick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities\n= 8,753,203.41 / 728,279.50\n≈ 12.02\n\nWait a minute, that seems unusually high. Let me double-check the components of quick assets. \n\nTypically, quick assets exclude inventory but include cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Interest receivable is also a current asset that's usually included. \n\nBut looking at the example provided earlier, their quick ratio was 1.54 with similar components. Maybe I'm including too much. \n\nIn the example:\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand (270,005.90) + Bank Deposits (164,645.57) + Interest Receivable (2,672.87) + Accounts Receivable (2,429,482.13) = 2,866,806.47\nCurrent Liabilities = 1,861,550.92\nQuick Ratio = 2,866,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54\n\nSo, it seems the method is correct. Maybe the current liabilities are much smaller in this problem compared to quick assets, leading to a high quick ratio.\n\nAlternatively, maybe bank deposits are not considered quick assets? But in the example, they were included. \n\nGiven that, my calculation seems correct based on the example. \n\n### Calculating Net Profit Margin\n\nNet Profit = 1,095,371.35\nTotal Revenue = 5,565,589.48\n\nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n= (1,095,371.35 / 5,565,589.48) * 100\n≈ 19.68%\n\n### Verifying with Example\n\nIn the example:\nNet Profit = -1,645,141.43\nTotal Revenue = 5,431,018.59\nNet Profit Margin = (-1,645,141.43 / 5,431,018.59) * 100 ≈ -30.29%\nWhich matches their solution. \n\nSo, my calculation method seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating:\n\n- Quick Ratio = 8,753,203.41 / 728,279.50 ≈ 12.02\n- Net Profit Margin = (1,095,371.35 / 5,565,589.48) * 100 ≈ 19.68%\n\nHowever, the quick ratio seems unusually high. Maybe bank deposits shouldn't be included twice (once as cash on hand and again as bank deposits). \n\nWait, is \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" both part of cash? Maybe they're separate, but in the example, both were included. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Bank Deposits\" are not immediately liquid, but usually, they are. \n\nGiven the example's method, I'll proceed with the initial calculation.\n\nBut to be safe, let's consider that \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" might be just \"Cash on Hand\" + \"Bank Deposits\". \n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\nEnding Balance (Cash and Cash Equivalents) = 7,242,255.76\nThis matches Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits: 4,303,451.63 + 2,938,804.13 = 7,242,255.76\n\nSo, perhaps Quick Assets = Cash and Cash Equivalents + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 7,242,255.76 + 8,592.81 + 1,502,354.84 = 8,753,203.41\n\nSame as before. \n\nGiven that, the quick ratio is indeed approximately 12.02. \n\nBut in reality, a quick ratio above 1 is generally good, and very high might indicate too much idle cash. \n\nGiven that, and since the calculation method aligns with the example, I'll present the numbers as calculated.\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, their quick assets were:\nCash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 270,005.90 + 164,645.57 + 2,672.87 + 2,429,482.13 = 2,866,806.47\nCurrent Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\nQuick Ratio: ~1.54\n\nSimilarly here:\nQuick Assets: 7,242,255.76 (Cash equiv) + 8,592.81 + 1,502,354.84 = 8,753,203.41\nCurrent Liabilities: 728,279.50\nQuick Ratio: 8,753,203.41 / 728,279.50 ≈ 12.02\n\nIt's possible that the company has a very high quick ratio due to large cash reserves relative to liabilities.\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nAfter rechecking, the calculations seem correct based on the given data and the example's method.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '12.02', 'Net Profit Margin': '19.68%'}}\n```",
