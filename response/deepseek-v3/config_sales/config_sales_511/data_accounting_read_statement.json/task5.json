These assets are typically categorized as \"Inventory\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: \n   - The balance sheet provided includes an \"Inventory\" line item, which represents goods held for sale in the ordinary course of business, goods in production for such sale, or goods in the process of being manufactured.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Inventory\" line item shows:\n     - **Initial_amount**: 0.00 (as of the Initial_date: 2023-12-31)\n     - **End_amount**: 440000.00 (as of the End_date: 2024-01-27)\n\n3. **Verify Other Line Items**:\n   - No other line items (e.g., \"Accounts Receivable\", \"Fixed Assets\") fit the description of assets held for sale or in production for sale. \n\n4. **Finalize the Solution**:\n   - The initial value of Inventory is 0.00, and the end value is 440000.00.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '440000.00'} }\n```",
