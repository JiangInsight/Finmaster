This is typically reflected in the \"Accounts Receivable\" line item in the cash flow statement under \"Operating Activities.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are looking for the line item that shows the change in accounts receivable, which indicates the decrease (or increase) in amounts owed to the entity by customers for credit sales.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: In the cash flow statement provided, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" represents the change in accounts receivable. A negative value here indicates an increase in accounts receivable (meaning more amounts are owed to the entity), while a positive value would indicate a decrease (meaning less amounts are owed to the entity).\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: From the given cash flow statement, the value for \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is `-1502354.84`. This negative value indicates an increase in accounts receivable, which means there was a decrease in the amounts owed to the entity (since more amounts are now outstanding).\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: The solution should be presented in the specified JSON format with the extracted value.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1502354.84'}}\n```",
