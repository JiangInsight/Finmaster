                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break down the task to understand what each of the four values we need to extract represents, and then locate them in the given cash flow statement.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task asks us to identify and extract four specific line items from the cash flow statement:\n\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is commonly known as **Depreciation**.\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period**: This refers to changes in **Inventory**.\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends**: This is the **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**.\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is the **Net Increase** in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nNow, let's find each of these in the provided cash flow statement.\n\n### Locating the Values in the Statement\n\nHere's the provided cash flow statement for reference:\n\n```\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-01-27 |\n| Net Profit  | 1095371.35 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Depreciation  | 45748.43 | 2024-01-27 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -1502354.84 | 2024-01-27 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -8592.81 | 2024-01-27 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -440000.00 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 450000.00 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 278279.50 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -81548.37 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-01-27 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 676195.87 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -676195.87 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-01-27 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Ending Balance  | 7242255.76 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Net Increase  | -757744.24 | 2024-01-27 |\n```\n\nNow, let's find each of the four items:\n\n1. **Depreciation**: \n   - This is explicitly listed as \"Depreciation\" with an amount of `45748.43`.\n\n2. **Change in Inventory**:\n   - This is listed as \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\". The amount is `-440000.00`. \n   - A negative value here indicates an increase in inventory (since it's an outflow), which aligns with the description of a reduction in assets held for sale.\n\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - This is directly listed as \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with an amount of `-676195.87`.\n\n4. **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n   - This is listed as \"Net Increase\" with an amount of `-757744.24`.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example to ensure we're on the right track:\n\n- `value1` was '45751.41' (Depreciation)\n- `value2` was '-5090000.00' (Increase in Inventory)\n- `value3` was '-305354.43' (Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities)\n- `value4` was '-7565348.53' (Net Increase in Cash)\n\nThis matches our understanding, so our approach seems correct.\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nNow, let's assign the values we've identified to the respective `value` fields:\n\n- `value1`: '45748.43' (Depreciation)\n- `value2`: '-440000.00' (Increase in Inventory)\n- `value3`: '-676195.87' (Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities)\n- `value4`: '-757744.24' (Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents)\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '45748.43', 'value2': '-440000.00', 'value3': '-676195.87', 'value4': '-757744.24'}}\n```",
