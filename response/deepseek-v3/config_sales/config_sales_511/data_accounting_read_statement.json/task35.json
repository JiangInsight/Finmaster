I'm going to go through the income statement provided and identify the four specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract four specific line items from the income statement:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**: This typically refers to \"Selling Expenses.\" These are costs associated with marketing, selling, and distributing products or services.\n   \n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually labeled as \"Financial Expenses\" or \"Interest Expense.\" These are costs related to borrowing money, like interest on loans.\n\n3. **The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is \"Depreciation.\" It's the allocation of the cost of tangible assets over their useful lives.\n\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period**: This is \"Tax Expense.\" It represents the income tax owed based on the taxable income.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Income Statement\nLet's look at the provided income statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 5565589.48 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Total Revenue | 5565589.48 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 3020000.00 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Total Cost | 3020000.00 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Gross Profit | 2545589.48 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 278023.19 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Selling Expenses | 662884.34 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Depreciation | 45748.43 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Financial Expenses | 193875.48 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Total Expenses | 1180531.44 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Interest Income | 8592.81 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 1373650.85 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Tax Expense | 278279.50 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Net Profit | 1095371.35 | 2024-01-27 |\n\n### Identifying the Required Line Items\n\n1. **Selling Expenses**: This is directly listed as \"Selling Expenses\" with an amount of `662884.34`.\n   \n2. **Depreciation**: Listed as \"Depreciation\" with an amount of `45748.43`.\n\n3. **Financial Expenses**: Listed as \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of `193875.48`.\n\n4. **Tax Expense**: Listed as \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of `278279.50`.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nLooking at the example provided:\n\n- Selling Expenses: `493854.67` (value1)\n- Depreciation: `45751.41` (value2)\n- Financial Expenses: `432511.69` (value3)\n- Tax Expense: `271550.92` (value4)\n\nThis confirms that the order is:\n1. Selling Expenses\n2. Depreciation\n3. Financial Expenses\n4. Tax Expense\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\nNow, plugging in the values from our problem:\n\n1. Selling Expenses: `662884.34`\n2. Depreciation: `45748.43`\n3. Financial Expenses: `193875.48`\n4. Tax Expense: `278279.50`\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '662884.34', 'value2': '45748.43', 'value3': '193875.48', 'value4': '278279.50'} }\n```",
