A negative value here indicates an increase in inventory (which is a use of cash), while a positive value would indicate a decrease in inventory (a source of cash). \n\nLooking at the provided problem, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" has a value of \"-440000.00\". This means there was an increase in inventory, which is a reduction in cash flow. \n\nThus, the value we need to extract is \"-440000.00\".\n\nHere is the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-440000.00'}}\n```",
