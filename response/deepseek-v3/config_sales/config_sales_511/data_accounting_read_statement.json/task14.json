These are typically classified as \"Current Liabilities\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Liabilities**: \n   - Current liabilities are obligations that are expected to be settled within the entity's normal operating cycle, usually within one year. In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Current Liabilities\" are:\n     - Accounts Payable\n     - Taxes Payable\n     - Total Current Liabilities\n\n2. **Initial Value of Total Current Liabilities**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is given as \"0.00\" on the \"Initial_date\" of \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **End Value of Total Current Liabilities**:\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is given as \"728279.50\" on the \"End_date\" of \"2024-01-27\".\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - The sum of the individual current liabilities (\"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\") should equal the \"Total Current Liabilities\":\n     - Accounts Payable: 450000.00\n     - Taxes Payable: 278279.50\n     - Total: 450000.00 + 278279.50 = 728279.50 (matches the \"Total Current Liabilities\" value).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '728279.50'} }\n```",
