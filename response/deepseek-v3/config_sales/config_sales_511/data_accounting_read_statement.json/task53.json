The cash flow statement shows changes in inventory, but this is not the same as the carrying amount of inventories sold.\n\n3. **Verification**: \n   - The \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the income statement is the most direct representation of the carrying amount of inventories sold during the period. \n   - The value \"3020000.00\" matches the description of the task, as it reflects the cost associated with the inventory that was sold.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The value to be extracted is the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" from the income statement, which is \"3020000.00\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3020000.00'}}\n```",
