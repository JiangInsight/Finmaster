This typically refers to the \"Accounts Payable\" line item in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: The amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit is recorded under \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet and cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Check the Balance Sheet**: \n   - Initial amount of Accounts Payable: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n   - End amount of Accounts Payable: 450,000.00 (as of 2024-01-27)\n   - The increase in Accounts Payable during the period is 450,000.00.\n\n3. **Verify with Cash Flow Statement**: \n   - The cash flow statement shows \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" as 450,000.00, which matches the increase observed in the balance sheet.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is 450,000.00.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '450000.00'}}\n```",
