This line item is typically labeled as \"Retained Earnings\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - Look for the account labeled \"Retained Earnings\" in the balance sheet. This account shows the cumulative profits or losses retained in the business after any distributions to shareholders (like dividends).\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" column under \"Retained Earnings\" shows the value at the start of the period (initial value).\n   - The \"End_amount\" column under \"Retained Earnings\" shows the value at the end of the period (end value).\n\n3. **Locate the Values in the Given Problem**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, the \"Retained Earnings\" row shows:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: 1095371.35 (as of 2024-01-27)\n\n4. **Prepare the Solution**:\n   - The initial value is '0.00'.\n   - The end value is '1095371.35'.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1095371.35'} }\n```",
