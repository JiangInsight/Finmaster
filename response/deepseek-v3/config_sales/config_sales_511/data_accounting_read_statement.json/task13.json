These are typically non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets and accumulated depreciation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Criteria**: \n   - Non-current assets are assets that are not expected to be converted into cash or used up within the normal operating cycle (usually one year). Examples include fixed assets (like property, plant, and equipment) and accumulated depreciation.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Line Items**:\n   - In the given balance sheet, the relevant line items under non-current assets are:\n     - Fixed Assets\n     - Accumulated Depreciation\n     - Total Non-current Assets\n\n3. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Total Non-current Assets\" line item directly provides the aggregated value of all non-current assets, which fits the criteria of assets not expected to be realized or consumed in the normal operating cycle.\n   - From the table:\n     - Initial value of Total Non-current Assets: `5000000.00` (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End value of Total Non-current Assets: `5630447.44` (as of 2024-01-27)\n\n4. **Verify**:\n   - The initial and end values for \"Total Non-current Assets\" are consistent with the sum of \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation\" (e.g., `5676195.87 - 45748.43 = 5630447.44` for the end value).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5630447.44'} }\n```",
