This typically refers to \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet, as it represents the amounts owed to suppliers or vendors for credit purchases.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - Look for \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet, as this is the standard account that records amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Accounts Payable\" is given as `0.00` with the \"Initial_date\" of `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Accounts Payable\" is given as `450000.00` with the \"End_date\" of `2024-01-27`.\n\n4. **Verify**:\n   - Ensure that no other line items (e.g., \"Taxes Payable\" or other liabilities) are mistakenly included, as the task specifically asks for amounts owed for goods or services on credit, which is solely \"Accounts Payable\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '450000.00'} }\n```",
