In the cash flow statement, this is represented by the line \"Net Increase\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section. In the given problem, this value is \"-757744.24\".\n\n2. Next, we need to decompose this net increase into two component sub-items that are also from the statement. Looking at the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, we can see the net increase is calculated from:\n   - Beginning Balance: 8000000.00\n   - Ending Balance: 7242255.76\n   (Net Increase = Ending Balance - Beginning Balance)\n\n3. Therefore, the two sub-items are the Beginning Balance and Ending Balance.\n\n4. Putting this together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-757744.24', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_item value2': '7242255.76'}}}\n```",
