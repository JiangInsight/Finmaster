These are typically referred to as \"Current Assets.\"\n\nFrom the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of all assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within one year or the operating cycle, whichever is longer. \n\nHere are the steps to identify the required values:\n\n1. **Identify the Initial Value of Total Current Assets**: \n   - In the \"Initial_amount\" column, the value for \"Total Current Assets\" is \"8000000.00\" as of the \"Initial_date\" \"2023-12-31.\"\n\n2. **Identify the End Value of Total Current Assets**: \n   - In the \"End_amount\" column, the value for \"Total Current Assets\" is \"9193203.41\" as of the \"End_date\" \"2024-01-27.\"\n\n3. **Verify the Line Item**: \n   - The line item \"Total Current Assets\" is the correct category for assets expected to be realized or consumed in the normal operating cycle, as it includes items like Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, Accounts Receivable, and Inventory.\n\nThus, the initial and end values for the total current assets are as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '9193203.41'} }\n```",
