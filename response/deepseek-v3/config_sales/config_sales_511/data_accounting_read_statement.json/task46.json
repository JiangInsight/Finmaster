                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the solution.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task is about analyzing a cash flow statement to extract specific information related to cash flows from investing activities. Here's what we need to do:\n\n1. **Identify the Net Amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents from Investing Activities**: This is the total cash generated or used in investing activities.\n2. **Decompose this Item into 1 Component Sub-item**: This means we need to find one specific line item that contributes to the net cash flow from investing activities.\n3. **Output the Final Values**: For both the net amount and its sub-item.\n\nFrom the example provided, it seems that the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is the main value we're interested in, and its sub-item is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nLet's look at the provided cash flow statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-01-27 |\n| Net Profit  | 1095371.35 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Depreciation  | 45748.43 | 2024-01-27 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -1502354.84 | 2024-01-27 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -8592.81 | 2024-01-27 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -440000.00 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 450000.00 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 278279.50 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -81548.37 | 2024-01-27 |\n| **Cash Flow from Investing Activities** |  | 2024-01-27 |\n| **Purchase of Fixed Assets**  | **676195.87** | 2024-01-27 |\n| **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**  | **-676195.87** | 2024-01-27 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-01-27 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Ending Balance  | 7242255.76 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Net Increase  | -757744.24 | 2024-01-27 |\n\n### Identifying the Required Items\n\n1. **Net Amount of Cash from Investing Activities**: This is clearly labeled as \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with a value of `-676195.87`.\n2. **Sub-item**: The only line item under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of `676195.87`. This is the component that makes up the net cash flow from investing activities. \n\n   - Note that the net cash flow is negative, which means cash was used (outflow), and the purchase of fixed assets is a positive amount indicating an outflow (since purchasing assets uses cash). Typically, purchases are shown as positive numbers implying cash outflow, hence the negative net cash flow.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the example:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: `-305354.43`\n- Sub-item (Purchase of Fixed Assets): `305354.43`\n\nThis matches our understanding where the sub-item is the purchase amount, and the net is the negative of that (since it's the only item).\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nFor our problem:\n\n- `value`: Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = `-676195.87`\n- `sub_items`: Purchase of Fixed Assets = `676195.87`\n\n### Formatting the Answer\n\nThe solution should be in JSON format as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-676195.87\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value\": \"676195.87\"}}}\n```\n\nHowever, looking at the example's format, it seems the sub_items is directly a dictionary with 'sub_item value' as the key. So, we'll follow that structure.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-676195.87\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value\": \"676195.87\"}}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Locate Investing Activities Section**: Found under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n2. **Identify Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: Directly given as `-676195.87`.\n3. **Find Sub-items**: Only one item listed is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" at `676195.87`.\n4. **Understand the Sign**: Purchase of assets is a cash outflow, hence positive in the statement leads to negative net cash flow.\n5. **Construct the Answer**: Map the values accordingly in the required JSON format.\n\nThis matches the example's structure where the net value is negative, and the sub-item is positive.",
