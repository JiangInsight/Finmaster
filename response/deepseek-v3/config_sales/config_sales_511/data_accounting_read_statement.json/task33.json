                        "content": "### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task requires us to identify and extract two specific line items from an income statement:\n\n1. **Income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities**: This typically refers to the revenue generated from the main business operations of the company. In income statements, this is often labeled as \"Main Business Revenue,\" \"Operating Revenue,\" or simply \"Revenue.\"\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is essentially the cost associated with the goods that were sold to generate the revenue mentioned above. In accounting terms, this is commonly referred to as the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\n### Analyzing the Given Example\n\nLooking at the provided example:\n\n```plaintext\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 5431018.59 | 2024-01-30 |\n| Total Revenue | 5431018.59 | 2024-01-30 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 4410000.00 | 2024-01-30 |\n| ... (other lines) ...\n```\n\n- **Main Business Revenue**: Clearly listed as \"Main Business Revenue\" with an amount of 5,431,018.59.\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: Listed as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with an amount of 4,410,000.00.\n\nThe solution correctly picks these two line items in order:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5431018.59', 'value2': '4410000.00'}}\n```\n\n### Applying to the Problem to Solve\n\nNow, let's examine the income statement provided in the problem:\n\n```plaintext\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 5565589.48 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Total Revenue | 5565589.48 | 2024-01-27 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 3020000.00 | 2024-01-27 |\n| ... (other lines) ...\n```\n\n1. **Income from Core Operating Activities**:\n   - The line item \"Main Business Revenue\" stands out as the primary revenue from core operations.\n   - Amount: 5,565,589.48.\n\n2. **Carrying Amount of Inventories Sold (COGS)**:\n   - The line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" represents this.\n   - Amount: 3,020,000.00.\n\n### Verifying the Order\n\nThe task specifies that the order of the values in the output should match the order in which the line items appear in the input statement. \n\n- \"Main Business Revenue\" appears first.\n- \"Cost of Goods Sold\" appears third (after \"Total Revenue\").\n\nThus, the order is correct as per the input.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nFollowing the structure and ensuring the order is maintained, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5565589.48', 'value2': '3020000.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Core Operating Income**:\n   - Look for the line item that represents revenue from main business activities.\n   - Found: \"Main Business Revenue\" = 5,565,589.48 → `value1`.\n\n2. **Identify Cost of Goods Sold**:\n   - Look for the line item representing the cost associated with sold inventory.\n   - Found: \"Cost of Goods Sold\" = 3,020,000.00 → `value2`.\n\n3. **Check Order**:\n   - \"Main Business Revenue\" appears before \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the input.\n   - Hence, `value1` is first, `value2` is second.\n\n4. **Construct JSON**:\n   - Format the answer as specified.\n\nThus, the correct extraction and ordering lead to the provided solution.",
