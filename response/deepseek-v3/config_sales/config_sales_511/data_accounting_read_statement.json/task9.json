This is typically listed under \"Taxes Payable\" in the liabilities section.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant line item**:\n   - The line item \"Taxes Payable\" represents the tax that has been accrued but not yet paid. This is the amount we are interested in.\n\n2. **Extract the initial value**:\n   - From the balance sheet, the \"Initial_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract the end value**:\n   - From the balance sheet, the \"End_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\" is `278279.50` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-01-27`.\n\n4. **Construct the solution**:\n   - The initial value is `0.00`.\n   - The end value is `278279.50`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '278279.50'} }\n```",
