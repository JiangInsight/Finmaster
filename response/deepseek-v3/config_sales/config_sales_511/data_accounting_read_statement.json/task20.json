In the provided income statement, the line item is clearly labeled as \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is \"3020000.00.\"\n\n4. **Verify**: Ensure that this is the correct line item by confirming that no other line item (e.g., \"Total Cost\") is more appropriate. In this case, \"Total Cost\" is the same as \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" which further confirms that \"3020000.00\" is the correct value.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3020000.00'}}\n```",
