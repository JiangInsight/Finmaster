This is typically listed under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n2. **Review the Cash Flow Statement**: In the provided cash flow statement, the relevant section is \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\". We need to look for a line item that indicates an increase or decrease in tax payable.\n\n3. **Identify the Line Item**: The line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" directly corresponds to the change in tax accrued but not yet paid. \n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" is \"278279.50\". This represents the increase in tax payable for the period.\n\n5. **Verify the Context**: The value is positive, indicating an increase in tax payable (i.e., more tax has been accrued but not yet paid).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '278279.50'} }\n```",
