I'm going to go through the cash flow statement provided and identify the three specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific pieces of information from the cash flow statement:\n\n1. **The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This typically refers to the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" because accounts payable represent amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit.\n   \n2. **Acquisition of property, plant, and equipment**: This is usually listed as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the cash flow statement under investing activities.\n   \n3. **Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period**: This is the \"Beginning Balance\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Cash Flow Statement\nLet's go through the provided cash flow statement line by line to find these items.\n\n#### 1. Increase in Accounts Payable\nLooking at the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, we see:\n- Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable: 450000.00\n\nThis is the amount by which the accounts payable have increased during the period, indicating more goods or services were purchased on credit.\n\n#### 2. Purchase of Fixed Assets\nUnder the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section, we find:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 676195.87\n\nThis represents the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment during the period.\n\n#### 3. Cash and Cash Equivalents at Beginning of Period\nIn the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section:\n- Beginning Balance: 8000000.00\n\nThis is the cash and cash equivalents at the start of the period.\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe task specifies that the order of the values in the output should match the order of the line items in the input statement. \n\nLooking at the input:\n1. \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" appears first in the operating activities.\n2. \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" comes next in the investing activities.\n3. \"Beginning Balance\" is last in the cash and cash equivalents section.\n\nSo, the order is correct as is.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together, the three values are:\n1. Increase in Accounts Payable: 450000.00\n2. Purchase of Fixed Assets: 676195.87\n3. Beginning Cash Balance: 8000000.00\n\nHere's the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '450000.00', 'value2': '676195.87', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
