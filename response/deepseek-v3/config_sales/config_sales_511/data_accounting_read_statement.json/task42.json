This is typically found under the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section of the cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Review the Cash Flow Statement**: In the provided problem, the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section includes the line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which is the relevant line item for cash payments to acquire PP&E and other long-term assets.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is `676195.87`.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is `-676195.87`, which matches the negative value of the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" confirming that this is the correct line item (since purchasing assets is a cash outflow).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '676195.87'} }\n```",
