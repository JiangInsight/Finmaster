This represents the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**: The initial value of \"Paid-in Capital\" is found under the \"Initial_amount\" column, which is \"13000000.00\" as of the \"Initial_date\" \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**: The end value of \"Paid-in Capital\" is found under the \"End_amount\" column, which is \"13000000.00\" as of the \"End_date\" \"2024-01-27\".\n\n4. **Verify**: Both the initial and end values are the same, indicating no change in the paid-in capital during the period.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
