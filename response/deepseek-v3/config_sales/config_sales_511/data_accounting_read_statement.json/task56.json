This is typically referred to as \"Depreciation\" in financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - Depreciation is a non-cash expense that systematically allocates the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life. It appears in multiple sections of the financial statements:\n     - **Income Statement**: Under \"Total Expenses,\" we see \"Depreciation\" listed with a value of \"45748.43.\"\n     - **Cash Flow Statement**: Under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities,\" \"Depreciation\" is listed with the same value of \"45748.43.\"\n     - **Balance Sheet**: The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" account shows the cumulative depreciation up to the end date, which is \"45748.43.\"\n\n2. **Verify Consistency**:\n   - The depreciation value is consistent across all three statements (Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement, and Balance Sheet), confirming that the correct value is \"45748.43.\"\n\n3. **Extract the Value**:\n   - The value to be extracted is \"45748.43.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45748.43'}}\n```",
