                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement extraction task step by step. I'm going to break down the problem to understand what we need to extract and where to find it in the given financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to identify and extract three specific line items from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under equity items, often labeled as \"Paid-in Capital\" or similar.\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is usually found in the Income Statement, often labeled as \"Profit Before Tax\".\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This relates to changes in \"Accounts Payable\" and is often found in the Cash Flow Statement under operating activities, labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n\nThe outputs should be grouped by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, maintain the original line item order as shown in the input.\n\n### Given Financial Statements\n\nWe have three financial statements provided:\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**\n2. **Income Statement**\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**\n\nLet's go through each one to find the required values.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking for: **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**\n\nIn the Balance Sheet, under the equity section, we see:\n- **Paid-in Capital**: Initial_amount = 13000000.00, End_amount = 13000000.00\n\nThis seems to be the capital contributed by shareholders. The amount hasn't changed during the period, so the value is `13000000.00`.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nLooking for: **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**\n\nIn the Income Statement, we see:\n- **Profit Before Tax**: 1373650.85\n\nThis is the profit before tax expense is deducted. So, the value is `1373650.85`.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nLooking for: **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**\n\nThis refers to the increase in Accounts Payable during the period. In the Cash Flow Statement under operating activities, we see:\n- **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: 450000.00\n\nThis indicates that Accounts Payable increased by `450000.00` during the period, meaning the entity owes more for goods/services purchased on credit.\n\n### Verifying the Order\n\nThe order should be:\n1. Balance Sheet (Paid-in Capital)\n2. Income Statement (Profit Before Tax)\n3. Cash Flow Statement (Increase in Accounts Payable)\n\nThis matches the required sequence.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1373650.85', 'value3': '450000.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**:\n   - Located \"Paid-in Capital\" with an end amount of `13000000.00`.\n   \n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - Found \"Profit Before Tax\" as `1373650.85`.\n   \n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - Identified \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" as `450000.00`.\n   \n4. **Order Verification**:\n   - Ensured the order is Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement.\n   \n5. **Final Output**:\n   - Compiled the values into the required JSON format.\n\nThis systematic approach ensures that we accurately extract and present the required financial data.",
