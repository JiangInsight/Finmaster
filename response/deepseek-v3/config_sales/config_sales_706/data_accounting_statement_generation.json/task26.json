Depreciation is typically recorded as an expense in the income statement, and it appears as a line item in the transactions data.\n\nLooking at the provided transactions, we can see that there is a specific entry labeled \"Depreciation\" with the ID \"Depreciation20240101001\". The amount recorded for this entry is \"45749.759999999995\".\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Depreciation Entries**: Scan the transactions for any entries where the \"type\" is \"Depreciation\".\n2. **Extract the Amount**: For the identified depreciation entry, note the \"amount\" or \"recorded_amount\" value.\n3. **Format the Answer**: Present the depreciation amount in the required JSON format.\n\nFrom the data:\n- The depreciation entry is: \"Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45749.759999999995 | 45749.759999999995 | ...\"\n- The amount is \"45749.759999999995\", which can be rounded to \"45749.76\" for simplicity.\n\nHowever, since the example provided in the task rounds to two decimal places, we will do the same.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45749.76'} }\n```",
