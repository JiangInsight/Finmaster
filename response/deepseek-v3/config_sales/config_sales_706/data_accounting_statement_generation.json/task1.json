I'm going to calculate the total amount of cash on hand in the balance sheet, including both the initial and final amounts. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\nWe have a list of transactions, and we need to determine:\n1. **Initial Cash on Hand**: This seems to be the amount from the initial \"Cash deposit\" transaction.\n2. **Final Cash on Hand**: This would be the initial cash adjusted by all cash inflows and outflows where the payment method is \"Cash\".\n\n### Identifying Relevant Transactions\nFrom the data:\n1. **Initial Cash Deposit**: \n   - `Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 3000000.0 | 3000000.0 | ...`\n     - This is our starting cash amount: **3,000,000.00**.\n\n2. **Cash Outflows (Expenses paid in Cash)**:\n   - We need to look for transactions where:\n     - `type` is \"Expense\" (like \"Sales Expenses\", \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Financial Expenses\") \n     - `payment_method` is \"Cash\"\n     - `payment/receipt_status` is \"Paid\" (since unpaid wouldn't affect cash yet)\n   - Similarly, purchases where `payment_method` is \"Cash\" and status is \"Paid\".\n\n3. **Cash Inflows (Sales received in Cash)**:\n   - Look for `type` \"Sale\" where `receive_method` is \"Cash\" and status is \"Paid\".\n\n4. **Transfers**:\n   - Any transfers from cash to bank would reduce cash on hand. Look for `type` \"Cash to bank transfer\".\n\n### Calculating Final Cash on Hand\nLet's go through the transactions one by one to adjust the initial cash.\n\n**Initial Cash**: 3,000,000.00\n\n#### Cash Outflows:\n1. **Expenses Paid in Cash**:\n   -
