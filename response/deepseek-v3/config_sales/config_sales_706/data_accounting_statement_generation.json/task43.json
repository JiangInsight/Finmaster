This includes cash received from customers for sales, cash paid for purchases, and cash paid for operating expenses. \n\n### Steps to Calculate Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:\n\n1. **Identify Cash Inflows from Operating Activities**:\n   - **Cash Sales**: Sum all sales transactions where the payment method is \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" and the payment/receipt_status is \"Paid\".\n   - **Interest Receivables**: Exclude these as they are not cash inflows unless received (most are marked as \"Unpaid\").\n\n2. **Identify Cash Outflows from Operating Activities**:\n   - **Cash Purchases**: Sum all purchase transactions where the payment method is \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" and the payment/receipt_status is \"Paid\".\n   - **Operating Expenses**: Sum all expense transactions (Sales Expenses, Administrative Expenses, Financial Expenses) where the payment method is \"Cash\" and the payment/receipt_status is \"Paid\".\n   - **Depreciation**: Exclude depreciation as it is a non-cash expense.\n\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**:\n   - Subtract total cash outflows from total cash inflows.\n\n### Calculations:\n\n#### Cash Inflows from Operating Activities (Cash Sales):\n- Sale20240102003: 39394.9 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240102004: 38148.42 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240105012: 26562.3 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240105013: 26388.51 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240106017: 38436.94 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240107019: 36168.09 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240108022: 173165.24 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240108023: 98199.15 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240109024: 18699.29 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240109025: 19892.26 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240110029: 174585.2 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240111034: 196067.34 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240111035: 17185.29 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240112038: 113181.93 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240113041: 90831.99 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240113042: 36413.56 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240113043: 56856.45 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240114047: 117413.01 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240115051: 294287.22 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240115052: 19890.08 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240116057: 17714.56 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240116058: 118848.96 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240117061: 18612.68 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240117062: 36238.8 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240117063: 176278.96 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240118065: 74434.04 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240118066: 37660.74 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240119068: 29785.86 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240119069: 34617.14 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240121076: 36143.32 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240121077: 261490.35 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240122081: 177778.96 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240122082: 88341.49 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240122083: 39109.78 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240123086: 35569.85 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240123088: 105626.73 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240124090: 173347.72 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240124091: 76538.96 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240124092: 266310.81 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240125095: 36921.82 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240125096: 8648.77 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240125097: 86533.38 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240126101: 19338.67 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240126102: 286885.38 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240127105: 295661.79 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240127106: 98343.59 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240128110: 38693.93 (Cash, Paid)\n- Sale20240128111: 51298.56 (Cash, Paid)\n\n**Total Cash Inflows from Operating Activities**: Sum of all above = 4,180,000.00 (approximate)\n\n#### Cash Outflows from Operating Activities:\n- **Cash Purchases**:\n  - Purchase20231231002: 40000.0 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n  - Purchase20231231005: 45000.0 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n  - Purchase20231231006: 140000.0 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n  - Purchase20231231007: 100000.0 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n  - Purchase20231231008: 25000.0 (Cash, Paid)\n  - Purchase20231231009: 80000.0 (Cash, Paid)\n  - Purchase20231231010: 500000.0 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n  - Purchase20231231012: 60000.0 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n  - Purchase20231231015: 30000.0 (Cash, Paid)\n  - Purchase20231231017: 350000.0 (Cash, Paid)\n  - Purchase20231231022: 120000.0 (Bank Transfer, Paid)\n\n  **Total Cash Purchases**: Sum of all above = 1,400,000.00 (approximate)\n\n- **Operating Expenses**:\n  - Sum all expense transactions where payment method is \"Cash\" and payment/receipt_status is \"Paid\".
