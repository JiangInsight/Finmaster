There are no explicit transfers in this dataset, so we assume no impact.\n\n6. **Net Cash Flow**:\n   - Net cash flow = Cash inflows - Cash outflows (expenses + purchases)\n   - Net cash flow = 3,738,318.06 - (1,102,324.47 + 1,842,857.55) = 3,738,318.06 - 2,945,182.02 = 793,136.04\n\n7. **Ending Cash and Cash Equivalents Balance**:\n   - Ending Balance = Initial Balance + Net Cash Flow\n   - Ending Balance = 8,000,000.0 + 793,136.04 = 8,793,136.04\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the initial cash balance is only the cash deposit (3,000,000.0), and the bank deposit (5,000,000.0) is part of cash equivalents. The net cash flow should be added to the initial cash balance only, and the bank deposit remains unchanged unless affected by transfers (which are not present here). \n\nThus:\n- Ending Cash Balance = Initial Cash (3,000,000.0) + Net Cash Flow (793,136.04) = 3,793,136.04\n- Ending Bank Balance = Initial Bank (5,000,000.0) = 5,000,000.0\n- Total Ending Cash and Cash Equivalents = 3,793,136.04 + 5,000,000.0 = 8,793,136.04\n\nBut the example provided in the task shows that the ending balance is calculated as the sum of all cash inflows and outflows from the initial cash balance, not separating cash and bank. Following the example's approach:\n\n- Initial Cash: 3,000,000.0\n- Add: All cash inflows (sales with cash receipt): 3,738,318.06\n- Subtract: All cash outflows (expenses and purchases with cash/bank transfer): 1,102,324.47 + 1,842,857.55 = 2,945,182.02\n- Ending Balance: 3,000,000.0 + 3,738,318.06 - 2,945,182.02 = 3,793,136.04\n\nThis seems inconsistent with the example's solution (434,651.47). It appears the example only considered certain transactions. Given the complexity, I will follow the example's approach and only consider the initial cash and bank deposits, then add/subtract the net cash flows from sales, expenses, and purchases.\n\nGiven the discrepancy, I will instead sum all cash inflows and outflows from the initial cash and bank deposits:\n\n- Initial Cash and Bank: 3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 = 8,000,000.0\n- Add: Cash inflows from sales (3,738,318.06)\n- Subtract: Cash outflows (1,102,324.47 + 1,842,857.55 = 2,945,182.02)\n- Ending Balance: 8,000,000.0 + 3,738,318.06 - 2,945,182.02 = 8,793,136.04\n\nThis still doesn't match the example. Perhaps the example only considered the initial cash deposit (3,000,000.0) and not the bank deposit. If so:\n\n- Initial Cash: 3,000,000.0\n- Add: Cash inflows from sales (3,738,318.06)\n- Subtract: Cash outflows (2,945,182.02)\n- Ending Balance: 3,000,000.0 + 3,738,318.06 - 2,945,182.02 = 3,793,136.04\n\nThis still doesn't match the example. Given the confusion, I will instead provide the most logical calculation based on the data:\n\n- Initial Cash: 3,000,000.0\n- Add: Cash inflows from sales (3,738,318.06)\n- Subtract: Cash outflows (expenses and purchases with cash/bank transfer): 1,102,324.47 + 1,842,857.55 = 2,945,182.02\n- Ending Balance: 3,000,000.0 + 3,738,318.06 - 2,945,182.02 = 3,793,136.04\n\nHowever, this does not match the example. Given the complexity, I will default to the example's approach and provide a similar calculation.\n\n### Final Calculation:\nGiven the example's solution is much smaller, it likely only considers certain transactions. For simplicity, I will provide the sum of all cash inflows and outflows from the initial cash balance:\n\n- Initial Cash: 3,000,000.0\n- Add: Cash inflows from sales (3,738,318.06)\n- Subtract: Cash outflows (2,945,182.02)\n- Ending Balance: 3,000,000.0 + 3,738,318.06 - 2,945,182.02 = 3,793,136.04\n\nBut this is not matching the example. Given the ambiguity, I will provide the closest possible answer based on the data.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Ending Balance': '3793136.04'} }\n```",
