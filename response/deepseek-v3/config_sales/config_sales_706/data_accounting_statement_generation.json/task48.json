Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Cash Deposits (Cash Inflows)**:\n   - Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n   - Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n   - Total initial cash inflows: 8,000,000.0\n\n2. **Fixed Assets Purchase (Cash Outflow)**:\n   - Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.0 (This is a non-cash item, so it doesn't affect cash flow directly)\n   - Fixed Assets Purchase: 352,857.55 (Paid via bank transfer, so it's a cash outflow)\n   - Total fixed assets cash outflow: 352,857.55\n\n3. **Purchases (Cash Outflows)**:\n   - Paid purchases: \n     - 40,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n     - 100,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n     - 140,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n     - 500,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n     - 120,000.0 (Bank Transfer)\n     - 350,000.0 (Cash)\n     - 30,000.0 (Cash)\n     - 80,000.0 (Cash)\n     - 25,000.0 (Cash)\n     - 60,000.0 (Cash)\n     - 160,000.0 (Cash)\n     - Total paid purchases: 1,605,000.0\n   - Unpaid purchases: These are account payables and do not affect cash flow yet.\n\n4. **Sales (Cash Inflows)**:\n   - Paid sales (cash received):\n     - 39,394.9\n     - 38,148.42\n     - 90,340.71\n     - 9,073.85\n     - 26,562.3\n     - 26,388.51\n     - 38,436.94\n     - 36,168.09\n     - 173,165.24\n     - 98,199.15\n     - 18,699.29\n     - 19,892.26\n     - 174,585.2\n     - 196,067.34\n     - 17,185.29\n     - 113,181.93\n     - 90,831.99\n     - 36,413.56\n     - 56,856.45\n     - 117,413.01\n     - 294,287.22\n     - 19,890.08\n     - 17,714.56\n     - 118,848.96\n     - 18,612.68\n     - 36,238.8\n     - 176,278.96\n     - 74,434.04\n     - 37,660.74\n     - 29,785.86\n     - 34,617.14\n     - 36,143.32\n     - 261,490.35\n     - 177,778.96\n     - 88,341.49\n     - 39,109.78\n     - 35,569.85\n     - 105,626.73\n     - 173,347.72\n     - 76,538.96\n     - 266,310.81\n     - 36,921.82\n     - 8,648.77\n     - 86,533.38\n     - 19,338.67\n     - 286,885.38\n     - 295,661.79\n     - 98,343.59\n     - 38,693.93\n     - 51,298.56\n     - Total paid sales: 3,618,123.34\n\n5. **Expenses (Cash Outflows)**:\n   - All expenses marked as \"Paid\" are cash outflows.

If we exclude the initial deposits:\n- Total cash inflows (only from sales): 3,618,123.34\n- Total cash outflows: 2,988,869.84\n- Net increase: 3,618,123.34 - 2,988,869.84 = 629,253.50\n\nBut this still doesn't match the example. Re-evaluating, perhaps the initial deposits are treated as opening balances, and only transactions during the period are considered for the cash flow statement. In that case:\n- Cash inflows (paid sales): 3,618,123.34\n- Cash outflows (paid purchases + expenses + fixed assets): 1,605,000.0 + 1,031,012.29 + 352,857.55 = 2,988,869.84\n- Net increase: 3,618,123.34 - 2,988,869.84 = 629,253.50\n\nThis still doesn't match the example's negative value. Perhaps the initial deposits are negative (outflows), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the fixed assets purchase is included in purchases. Recalculating:\n- Paid purchases: 1,605,000.0\n- Fixed assets purchase: 352,857.55\n- Expenses: 1,031,012.29\n- Total outflows: 1,605,000.0 + 352,857.55 + 1,031,012.29 = 2,988,869.84\n- Inflows: 3,618,123.34\n- Net: 3,618,123.34 - 2,988,869.84 = 629,253.50\n\nThis still doesn't align with the example. Given the complexity, I'll proceed with the most logical calculation excluding initial deposits as they are likely opening balances.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Increase': '629253.50'} }\n```",
