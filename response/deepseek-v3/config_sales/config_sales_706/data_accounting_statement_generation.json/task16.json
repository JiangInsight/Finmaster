Paid-in capital typically represents the amount of money that shareholders have invested in the company through the purchase of stock. \n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Transactions**: \n   - Look for transactions that represent initial capital injections into the company. These are typically labeled as \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", or similar in the transaction data.\n   - In the given problem, the initial transactions are:\n     - \"Cash deposit\" with an amount of 3,000,000.0\n     - \"Bank deposit\" with an amount of 5,000,000.0\n     - \"Fixed Assets\" with an amount of 5,000,000.0\n\n2. **Calculate Initial Paid-in Capital**:\n   - Sum the amounts of the initial transactions to get the total initial paid-in capital.\n   - Initial Paid-in Capital = Cash deposit + Bank deposit + Fixed Assets\n   - Initial Paid-in Capital = 3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 = 13,000,000.0\n\n3. **Identify Final Transactions**:\n   - The paid-in capital does not typically change unless there are additional capital injections or withdrawals by shareholders. In the given data, there are no transactions indicating additional capital injections or withdrawals after the initial transactions.\n   - Therefore, the final paid-in capital remains the same as the initial paid-in capital.\n\n4. **Calculate Final Paid-in Capital**:\n   - Final Paid-in Capital = Initial Paid-in Capital = 13,000,000.0\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
