                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: Return on Equity (ROE), Debt to Asset Ratio, and Gross Profit Margin. \n\n### 1. Understanding the Ratios\n\n**a. Return on Equity (ROE):**\nThis measures how effectively a company is using its shareholders' equity to generate profit. The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Shareholder's Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n\n**b. Debt to Asset Ratio:**\nThis shows the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**c. Gross Profit Margin:**\nThis indicates the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\n### 2. Extracting Necessary Data from the Financial Statements\n\nLet's pull out the numbers we need from each statement.\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- **Total Liabilities:** Under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" we have 2,110,671.05.\n- **Total Assets:** Given as 16,213,861.65.\n- **Total Owner's Equity (Shareholder's Equity):** 14,103,190.60.\n\n**From the Income Statement:**\n- **Net Profit:** 1,103,190.60.\n- **Gross Profit:** 2,638,420.67.\n- **Total Revenue:** 5,813,420.67.\n\n### 3. Calculating Each Ratio\n\n**a. Return on Equity (ROE):**\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{1,103,190.60}{14,103,190.60} \\times 100 \\]\nLet's do the division first:\n\\[ \\frac{1,103,190.60}{14,103,190.60} \\approx 0.0782 \\]\nNow multiply by 100:\n\\[ 0.0782 \\times 100 \\approx 7.82\\% \\]\n\n**b. Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{2,110,671.05}{16,213,861.65} \\]\nDoing the division:\n\\[ \\frac{2,110,671.05}{16,213,861.65} \\approx 0.130 \\]\nSo, it's approximately 0.13.\n\n**c. Gross Profit Margin:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{2,638,420.67}{5,813,420.67} \\times 100 \\]\nFirst, divide:\n\\[ \\frac{2,638,420.67}{5,813,420.67} \\approx 0.4538 \\]\nMultiply by 100:\n\\[ 0.4538 \\times 100 \\approx 45.38\\% \\]\n\n### 4. Verifying Calculations\n\nLet me quickly check each calculation to ensure no mistakes.\n\n- **ROE:** 1,103,190.60 / 14,103,190.60 ≈ 0.0782 → 7.82% ✔\n- **Debt to Asset:** 2,110,671.05 / 16,213,861.65 ≈ 0.130 ✔\n- **Gross Profit Margin:** 2,638,420.67 / 5,813,420.67 ≈ 0.4538 → 45.38% ✔\n\nAll seem correct.\n\n### 5. Final Answer\n\nNow, let's present the results in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '7.82%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.38%'}}\n```\n\n### 6. Additional Notes\n\n- **ROE (7.82%):** This means that for every dollar of shareholder's equity, the company generated about 7.82 cents in profit. This is a positive sign as it indicates profitability relative to equity.\n  \n- **Debt to Asset Ratio (0.13):** This ratio is relatively low, indicating that only 13% of the company's assets are financed by debt. The rest is financed by equity, suggesting a lower financial risk.\n  \n- **Gross Profit Margin (45.38%):** This is quite healthy, indicating that the company retains about 45.38% of its revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This suggests good control over production costs or strong pricing power.\n\nThese ratios collectively suggest that the company is in a good financial position with healthy profitability, low debt, and strong gross margins.",
