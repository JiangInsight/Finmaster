                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one using the provided financial statements. I'll go through each calculation step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 1,598,438.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 2,110,671.05\n\nCalculation:\n1,598,438.00 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 0.757\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 2,110,671.05 (this is the only liability listed, so we'll consider this as total debt)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,103,190.60\n\nCalculation:\n2,110,671.05 / 14,103,190.60 ≈ 0.15\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 5,813,420.67\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets = 16,213,861.65\n- Average Total Assets = (Initial + End) / 2 = (13,000,000 + 16,213,861.65) / 2 = 14,606,930.825\n\nCalculation:\n5,813,420.67 / 14,606,930.825 ≈ 0.40\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 10,906,753.86\n- Inventory = 295,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 2,110,671.05\n\nCalculation:\n(10,906,753.86 - 295,000) / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 10,611,753.86 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 5.03\n\nWait a minute, this seems unusually high. Let me double-check the components of current assets:\nFrom the balance sheet, current assets include:\n- Cash on Hand: 5,603,438.00\n- Bank Deposits: 3,642,142.45\n- Interest Receivable: 10,710.07\n- Accounts Receivable: 1,355,463.34\n- Inventory: 295,000.00\nTotal = 5,603,438 + 3,642,142.45 + 10,710.07 + 1,355,463.34 + 295,000 = 10,906,753.86 (matches)\n\nQuick assets = Current assets - Inventory = 10,906,753.86 - 295,000 = 10,611,753.86\nQuick Ratio = 10,611,753.86 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 5.03\n\nThis seems correct based on the numbers provided. The company has a lot of cash and receivables relative to its current liabilities.\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nThis is the same as the first ratio we calculated:\n1,598,438.00 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 0.76\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Income / Average Shareholder's Equity\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = 1,103,190.60\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Owner's Equity = 13,000,000.00\n- End Total Owner's Equity = 14,103,190.60\n- Average Equity = (13,000,000 + 14,103,190.60) / 2 = 13,551,595.30\n\nCalculation:\n1,103,190.60 / 13,551,595.30 ≈ 0.0814 or 8.14%\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since no info on cash sales is given):\n- Net Sales = 5,813,420.67\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00 (assuming since it's not listed in initial amounts)\n- End Accounts Receivable = 1,355,463.34\n- Average AR = (0 + 1,355,463.34) / 2 = 677,731.67\n\nCalculation:\n5,813,420.67 / 677,731.67 ≈ 8.58\n\nHowever, if initial AR is not zero (but not provided), this might be inaccurate. Given the data, initial AR seems to be zero, so the calculation stands.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.76', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.40', 'Quick Ratio': '5.03', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.76', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '8.14%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '8.58'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me quickly verify if all calculations make sense:\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities and Operating Cash Flow Ratio are the same, which checks out.\n- Debt to Equity is low, indicating more equity than debt, which aligns with the balance sheet.\n- Total Asset Turnover is moderate, indicating assets are being used somewhat efficiently.\n- Quick Ratio is very high due to large cash and receivables compared to small current liabilities.\n- ROE is positive, reflecting profitability.\n- AR Turnover is high, indicating efficient collection (but initial AR was zero, which might skew this).\n\nEverything seems consistent with the provided data.",
