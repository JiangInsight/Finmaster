                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the five requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all Main Business Revenue is credit sales) = 5,813,420.67\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable = 0.00 (from initial balance sheet)\n- Ending Accounts Receivable = 1,355,463.34\n\n**Average Accounts Receivable:**  \n(0 + 1,355,463.34) / 2 = 677,731.67\n\n**Calculation:**  \n5,813,420.67 / 677,731.67 ≈ 8.58\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 1,598,438.00\n- Current Liabilities = 2,110,671.05\n\n**Calculation:**  \n1,598,438.00 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 0.76\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis seems identical to the Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the example provided. So, it's the same calculation as above.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n1,598,438.00 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 0.76\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Sales (Main Business Revenue) = 5,813,420.67\n- Beginning Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets = 16,213,861.65\n\n**Average Total Assets:**  \n(13,000,000.00 + 16,213,861.65) / 2 = 14,606,930.83\n\n**Calculation:**  \n5,813,420.67 / 14,606,930.83 ≈ 0.40\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\n**Given:**\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 2,110,671.05 (since no long-term liabilities are mentioned)\n- Total Shareholders' Equity = 14,103,190.60\n\n**Calculation:**  \n2,110,671.05 / 14,103,190.60 ≈ 0.15\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '8.58', 'operating cash flow ratio': '0.76', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.76', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.40', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15'}}\n```\n\n**Verification with Example:**\nLooking back at the example provided, the calculations seem consistent with how the example was solved. For instance:\n- The Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio was calculated similarly using net sales and average receivables.\n- Operating cash flow ratios used net operating cash flow over current liabilities.\n- Total Asset Turnover used net sales over average total assets.\n- Debt to Equity used total liabilities over total equity.\n\nEverything checks out!",
