                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 10,906,753.86\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 2,110,671.05\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 10,906,753.86 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 5.17\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 5,603,438.00\n- Bank Deposits = 3,642,142.45 (assuming these are like marketable securities or cash equivalents)\n- Accounts Receivable = 1,355,463.34\n- Interest Receivable = 10,710.07 (usually considered part of quick assets)\n- Current Liabilities = 2,110,671.05\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable\n= 5,603,438.00 + 3,642,142.45 + 1,355,463.34 + 10,710.07 ≈ 10,611,753.86\n\nQuick Ratio = 10,611,753.86 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 5.03\n\n*Wait a minute, the quick ratio is higher than the current ratio, which shouldn't happen because current assets include inventory, which is excluded from quick assets. Let me check the components.*\n\nActually, Total Current Assets = 10,906,753.86\nQuick Assets = Cash + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 5,603,438.00 + 3,642,142.45 + 10,710.07 + 1,355,463.34 = 10,611,753.86\nInventory = 295,000.00\n\n10,611,753.86 + 295,000 = 10,906,753.86 (matches total current assets)\n\nSo Quick Ratio = 10,611,753.86 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 5.03\n\nThis seems correct; the quick ratio is slightly less than the current ratio because inventory is a small portion here.\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\nTotal Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 2,110,671.05\nTotal Assets = 16,213,861.65\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 2,110,671.05 / 16,213,861.65 ≈ 0.13\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\nTotal Liabilities = 2,110,671.05\nTotal Owner's Equity = 14,103,190.60\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 2,110,671.05 / 14,103,190.60 ≈ 0.15\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 1,598,438.00\nTotal Debt = Total Liabilities = 2,110,671.05\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = 1,598,438.00 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 0.76\n\n*Wait, in the example provided, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio was negative, and here it's positive. That makes sense because in the example, operating cash flow was negative, and here it's positive.*\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '5.17', 'Quick Ratio': '5.03', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.76'}}\n```\n\n*Reviewing the quick ratio again, it seems unusually high compared to the current ratio. Maybe bank deposits shouldn't be included in quick assets if they're not readily available. If we exclude bank deposits:*\n\nAlternative Quick Ratio:\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable\n= 5,603,438.00 + 1,355,463.34 + 10,710.07 = 6,969,611.41\nQuick Ratio = 6,969,611.41 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 3.30\n\nThis seems more reasonable. Maybe bank deposits are not considered quick assets unless specified. Given that, let's adjust:\n\nRevised Quick Ratio: 3.30\n\nUpdating the answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '5.17', 'Quick Ratio': '3.30', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.76'}}\n```\n\n*But in the example, bank deposits were included in quick assets (Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable). Maybe the initial calculation was correct. Given the ambiguity, I'll stick with the first interpretation where bank deposits are included, as in the example.*\n\nFinal Answer (including bank deposits in quick assets):\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '5.17', 'Quick Ratio': '5.03', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.76'}}\n```",
