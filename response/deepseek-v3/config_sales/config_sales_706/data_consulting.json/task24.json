                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate two ratios: the Debt to Asset Ratio and the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities here): 2,110,671.05\n- Total Assets: 16,213,861.65\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{2,110,671.05}{16,213,861.65} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2,110,671.05}{16,213,861.65} \\approx 0.130 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.13.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operations to the net income, indicating how well net income is being converted into cash. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: 1,598,438.00\n- Net Profit (from Income Statement): 1,103,190.60\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{1,598,438.00}{1,103,190.60} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,598,438.00}{1,103,190.60} \\approx 1.449 \\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is approximately 1.45.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n**Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n- Total Liabilities: Only current liabilities are given as 2,110,671.05 (Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable).\n- Total Assets: 16,213,861.65.\n- Ratio: 2,110,671.05 / 16,213,861.65 ≈ 0.13 (correct).\n\n**Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:**\n- Operating Cash Flow: 1,598,438.00.\n- Net Profit: 1,103,190.60.\n- Ratio: 1,598,438 / 1,103,190.60 ≈ 1.45 (correct).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating both ratios, here's the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '1.45'} }\n```",
