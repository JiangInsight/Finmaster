In this case, the entire net cash flow from investing activities is the purchase of fixed assets, which represents capital expenditures.\n   - FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n   - FCF = 1,598,438.00 + (-352,857.55) = 1,245,580.45\n\n4. **Verify with Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The net increase in cash and cash equivalents should match the FCF if all other cash flows (like financing activities) are zero or not present. Here, the net increase is 1,245,580.45, which matches our FCF calculation.\n\nThus, the Free Cash Flow (FCF) is 1,245,580.45.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '1245580.45'} }\n```",
