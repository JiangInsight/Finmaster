                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Asset Ratio, the Gross Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. \n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 2,110,671.05\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 2,110,671.05\n- **Total Assets:** 16,213,861.65\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{2,110,671.05}{16,213,861.65} \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{2,110,671.05}{16,213,861.65} \\approx 0.130 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.13 or 13%.\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 2,638,420.67\n- **Total Revenue:** 5,813,420.67\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,638,420.67}{5,813,420.67} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's calculate:\n\\[ \\frac{2,638,420.67}{5,813,420.67} \\approx 0.4538 \\]\n\\[ 0.4538 \\times 100 \\approx 45.38\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately 45.38%.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** 1,598,438.00\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 2,110,671.05\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{1,598,438.00}{2,110,671.05} \\]\n\nLet's compute:\n\\[ \\frac{1,598,438.00}{2,110,671.05} \\approx 0.757 \\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately 0.76.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.38%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.76'} }\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the ratios were given with two decimal places for the Debt to Asset Ratio and Operating Cash Flow Ratio, and the Gross Profit Margin was rounded to two decimal places as well. Following that format, I'll adjust:\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.13 (already two decimal places)\n- Gross Profit Margin: 45.38% (as calculated)\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: 0.76 (already two decimal places)\n\nSo, the final answer remains:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.38%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.76'} }\n```",
