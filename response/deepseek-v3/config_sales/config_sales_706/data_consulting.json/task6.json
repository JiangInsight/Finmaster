                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Net Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Net Profit Margin\nFirst, I recall that the Net Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows what percentage of a company's revenue is actual profit after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nThis will give us a percentage that represents how much out of every dollar of revenue the company keeps as profit.\n\n### Identifying the Given Values\nFrom the provided income statement, I can see:\n\n- **Total Revenue**: \\$5,813,420.67\n- **Net Profit**: \\$1,103,190.60\n\nThese are the two key numbers I need for the calculation.\n\n### Performing the Calculation\nNow, plugging these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,103,190.60}{5,813,420.67} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide Net Profit by Total Revenue:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,103,190.60}{5,813,420.67} \\approx 0.1897 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.1897 \\times 100 \\approx 18.97\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nLet me double-check the division to ensure accuracy:\n\n\\[ 1,103,190.60 \\div 5,813,420.67 \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n- 5,813,420.67 goes into 1,103,190.60 less than once.\n- 5,813,420.67 × 0.1 = 581,342.067\n- Subtract that from 1,103,190.60: 1,103,190.60 - 581,342.067 ≈ 521,848.533\n- Now, 5,813,420.67 × 0.08 = 465,073.6536\n- Subtract: 521,848.533 - 465,073.6536 ≈ 56,774.8794\n- Next, 5,813,420.67 × 0.009 ≈ 52,320.786\n- Subtract: 56,774.8794 - 52,320.786 ≈ 4,454.0934\n- Adding up the multipliers: 0.1 + 0.08 + 0.009 = 0.189\n- The remainder is small, so approximately 0.1897 seems correct.\n\nMultiplying by 100 gives ~18.97%, which checks out.\n\n### Considering the Example\nLooking back at the example provided:\n\n- Net Profit: -1,645,141.43\n- Total Revenue: 5,431,018.59\n- Calculation: (-1,645,141.43 / 5,431,018.59) × 100 ≈ -30.29%\n\nThis matches the given solution, confirming that the method is correct.\n\n### Final Calculation\nSo, for our problem:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,103,190.60}{5,813,420.67} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 18.97\\% \\]\n\n### Presenting the Answer\nThe final answer should be presented in the specified JSON format with the Net Profit Margin rounded to two decimal places as in the example.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '18.97%'}}\n```\n\n### Potential Pitfalls\n- **Negative Net Profit**: In the example, the net profit was negative, leading to a negative margin. Here, it's positive, so the margin is positive.\n- **Revenue vs. Main Business Revenue**: Sometimes, total revenue might include other income, but here, Main Business Revenue equals Total Revenue, so no adjustment is needed.\n- **Precision**: Ensuring the division is accurate to avoid rounding errors. Calculating to four decimal places before converting to percentage helps.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter carefully performing the calculations and verifying each step, the Net Profit Margin for the given income statement is **18.97%**.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '18.97%'}}\n```",
