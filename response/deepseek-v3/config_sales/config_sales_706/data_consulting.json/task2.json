These are assets that can be quickly converted into cash. Inventory is excluded because it is not as liquid.\n   - **Current Liabilities** are the liabilities that are due within one year, which in this case are Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Accounts from the Balance Sheet**:\n   - **Quick Assets**:\n     - Cash on Hand: 5,603,438.00\n     - Bank Deposits: 3,642,142.45\n     - Interest Receivable: 10,710.07\n     - Accounts Receivable: 1,355,463.34\n   - **Current Liabilities**:\n     - Accounts Payable: 1,820,000.00\n     - Taxes Payable: 290,671.05\n     - Total Current Liabilities: 2,110,671.05\n\n3. **Calculate Quick Assets**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Assets} = \\text{Cash on Hand} + \\text{Bank Deposits} + \\text{Interest Receivable} + \\text{Accounts Receivable}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Assets} = 5,603,438.00 + 3,642,142.45 + 10,710.07 + 1,355,463.34 = 10,611,753.86\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Quick Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{10,611,753.86}{2,110,671.05} \\approx 5.03\n   \\]\n\n5. **Present the Answer**:\n   The Quick Ratio is rounded to two decimal places for clarity.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '5.03'}}\n```",
