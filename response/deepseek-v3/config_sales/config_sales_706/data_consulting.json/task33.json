                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'll go through each ratio one by one, explaining how I arrive at the numbers.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 1,598,438.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 2,110,671.05\n\nCalculation:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = 1,598,438.00 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 0.757\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFirst, we need to determine Total Debt. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" which is 2,110,671.05. There are no long-term debts mentioned, so we'll assume Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities.\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = 1,598,438.00 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 0.757\n\n*Wait a minute, this seems the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. Maybe \"Debt\" here refers to all liabilities, which in this case is just current liabilities. Alternatively, if \"Debt\" is considered as total liabilities minus non-debt items, but since we only have current liabilities, it's the same. Maybe the example had a different interpretation. Let me check the example.*\n\nLooking back at the example:\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.90\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: same numerator / same denominator ≈ -3.90\n\nSo in the example, both ratios used the same denominator. Maybe \"Debt\" here is considered as current liabilities. Alternatively, perhaps \"Debt\" is accounts payable + taxes payable, but in the example, that sums to total current liabilities. So it seems both ratios use the same denominator in the example.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = 0.757\n\nBut the example had the same value for both, so perhaps it's intended that way unless there's more debt info. Since no long-term debt is provided, this seems correct.\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:** Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 3,175,000.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00\n- End Inventory = 295,000.00\n\nAverage Inventory = (Initial + End) / 2 = (0 + 295,000) / 2 = 147,500\n\nCalculation:\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 3,175,000 / 147,500 ≈ 21.53\n\n*Wait, that seems high. Let me check the example:*\n\nExample:\nCOGS = 4,410,000\nInitial Inventory = 0\nEnd Inventory = 5,090,000\nAverage = (0 + 5,090,000)/2 = 2,545,000\nRatio = 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73\n\nOkay, so my calculation method seems correct, just the numbers are different here leading to a higher ratio.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (assuming this is total debt) = 2,110,671.05\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,103,190.60\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 2,110,671.05 / 14,103,190.60 ≈ 0.15\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:** (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 10,906,753.86\n- Inventory = 295,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 2,110,671.05\n\nCalculation:\nQuick Ratio = (10,906,753.86 - 295,000) / 2,110,671.05\n= 10,611,753.86 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 5.03\n\n*Check example:*\nExample:\nCurrent Assets = 7,956,806.47\nInventory = 5,090,000\nCurrent Liabilities = 1,861,550.92\nQuick Ratio = (7,956,806.47 - 5,090,000) / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54\n\nSo method seems correct.\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = 10,906,753.86\n- Current Liabilities = 2,110,671.05\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 10,906,753.86 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 5.17\n\n*Example:*\nCurrent Assets = 7,956,806.47\nCurrent Liabilities = 1,861,550.92\nRatio ≈ 4.27\n\nMethod correct.\n\n### Final Answer:\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio: 0.757\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: 0.757\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio: 21.53\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.15\n5. Quick Ratio: 5.03\n6. Current Ratio: 5.17\n\nHowever, looking back, the Inventory Turnover seems unusually high compared to the example. Maybe I missed that inventory was zero at start and only 295,000 at end, with COGS being 3,175,000, leading to high turnover. Alternatively, if inventory was not zero at start but not provided, but initial is given as zero. So seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, quick and current ratios are high because current assets are much higher than liabilities.\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.76', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.76', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '21.53', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Quick Ratio': '5.03', 'Current Ratio': '5.17'}}\n```\n\nBut the example had ratios like '1.73', '3.90', etc., so maybe they rounded to two decimal places. I'll do the same:\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio: 0.76\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio: 0.76\nInventory Turnover Ratio: 21.53 (maybe 21.53 is fine as is)\nDebt to Equity Ratio: 0.15\nQuick Ratio: 5.03\nCurrent Ratio: 5.17\n\nFinal JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.76', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.76', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '21.53', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Quick Ratio': '5.03', 'Current Ratio': '5.17'}}\n```\n\n*Wait, the Inventory Turnover seems too high compared to example's 1.73. Maybe initial inventory wasn't zero? But in the given data, initial is zero. Alternatively, maybe COGS is for a period not matching inventory change, but seems aligned. Maybe it's correct.*\n\nAlternatively, if inventory was not zero at start but not provided, but initial is given as zero. So seems correct.\n\nThus, final answer is as above.",
