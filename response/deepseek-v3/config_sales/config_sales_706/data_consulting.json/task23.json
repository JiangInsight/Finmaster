                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial task step by step. I'm going to calculate two ratios: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: This ratio measures a company's ability to cover its debts with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   Here, \"Total Debt\" can be considered as the \"Total Current Liabilities\" from the balance sheet since it represents the company's short-term obligations.\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the provided financial statements:\n\n**Income Statement:**\n- Total Revenue: \\$5,813,420.67\n- Gross Profit: \\$2,638,420.67\n\n**Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: \\$1,598,438.00\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Liabilities: \\$2,110,671.05\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,638,420.67}{5,813,420.67} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\\[\n\\frac{2,638,420.67}{5,813,420.67} \\approx 0.4538\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\\[\n0.4538 \\times 100 \\approx 45.38\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **45.38%**.\n\n### Calculating Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{1,598,438.00}{2,110,671.05}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{1,598,438.00}{2,110,671.05} \\approx 0.7573\n\\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **0.76**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nJust to ensure I didn't make any mistakes:\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit / Total Revenue = 2,638,420.67 / 5,813,420.67 ≈ 0.4538 → 45.38%\n   - This seems correct.\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   - Operating Cash Flow / Total Current Liabilities = 1,598,438 / 2,110,671.05 ≈ 0.7573\n   - This also seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '45.38%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.76'} }\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin**: A higher gross profit margin indicates that the company retains more from each dollar of sales to cover its other costs. Here, 45.38% is a healthy margin, meaning the company is making a good profit on its sales after accounting for the cost of goods sold.\n  \n- **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: A ratio of 0.76 means that the company's operating cash flow can cover about 76% of its current liabilities. Ideally, a ratio of 1 or higher is preferable, indicating that the company can fully cover its short-term debts with its operating cash flow. However, 0.76 is still decent, showing that the company is generating a significant portion of the cash needed to cover its debts.\n\nIf there are any discrepancies or if the interpretation of \"Total Debt\" should include other liabilities not listed here, the ratio might need adjustment. But based on the given data, these calculations seem accurate.",
