These items are typically classified as \"Fixed Assets\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - From the given balance sheet, the line item that represents tangible items held for use in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes is \"Fixed Assets\".\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Fixed Assets\" is provided as \"5000000.00\" with the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Fixed Assets\" is provided as \"5352857.55\" with the end date \"2024-01-28\".\n\n4. **Verify Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - Although \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is listed, it is not part of the initial or end value of the fixed assets themselves. The \"Fixed Assets\" line item already represents the net value after considering depreciation (if applicable).\n\n5. **Final Values**:\n   - The initial value of the fixed assets is \"5000000.00\".\n   - The end value of the fixed assets is \"5352857.55\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5352857.55'} }\n```",
