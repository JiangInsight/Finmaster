In the given problem, it is \"Main Business Revenue\" with the value \"5813420.67\".\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is typically the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" line item, which represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company. In the given problem, it is \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with the value \"3175000.00\".\n\nThe order of the values in the solution should match the order of the line items in the input statement. \n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify \"Main Business Revenue\" as the income from core operating activities. Its value is \"5813420.67\".\n2. Identify \"Cost of Goods Sold\" as the carrying amount of inventories sold. Its value is \"3175000.00\".\n3. Place these values in the solution in the same order as they appear in the input statement.\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5813420.67', 'value2': '3175000.00'} }\n```",
