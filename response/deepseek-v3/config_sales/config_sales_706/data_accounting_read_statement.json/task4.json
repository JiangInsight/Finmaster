This is because \"Interest Receivable\" refers to interest income that has been earned but not yet received in cash.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The initial amount for \"Interest Receivable\" is given as '0.00' on the initial date '2023-12-31'.\n   - **End Value**: The end amount for \"Interest Receivable\" is given as '10710.07' on the end date '2024-01-28'.\n\n3. **Verify the Data**: Ensure that the values extracted are correct by cross-referencing them with the provided balance sheet. The \"Interest Receivable\" line clearly shows the initial and end amounts as '0.00' and '10710.07' respectively.\n\n4. **Present the Solution**: The solution should be presented in the specified JSON format with the initial and end values.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '10710.07'} }\n```",
