This is because COGS reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, including the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the goods, and excludes indirect expenses such as distribution costs and sales force costs.\n\n2. **Identifying the Line Item**: In the given income statement, the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is present with an amount of \"3175000.00\".\n\n3. **Extracting the Value**: The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is the value we are looking for, as it represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3175000.00'} }\n```",
