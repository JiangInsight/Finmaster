This is because retained earnings reflect the cumulative amount of profits or losses that have been retained in the business rather than distributed to shareholders.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**: The initial value of retained earnings is provided in the \"Initial_amount\" column for the \"Retained Earnings\" row. In the given problem, this value is \"0.00\" as of the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**: The end value of retained earnings is provided in the \"End_amount\" column for the \"Retained Earnings\" row. In the given problem, this value is \"1103190.60\" as of the end date \"2024-01-28\".\n\n4. **Verify**: Ensure that the values are correctly extracted from the \"Retained Earnings\" row and not from any other line item. The example provided in the task description also confirms that \"Retained Earnings\" is the correct line item to consider.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1103190.60'} }\n```",
