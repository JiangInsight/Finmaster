The Income Statement does not contain either of the required line items, so it is skipped.\n\n4. **Final values:**\n   - value1 (Interest accrued but not yet received): \"10710.07\"\n   - value2 (Net addition in cash and cash equivalents): \"1245580.45\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '10710.07', 'value2': '1245580.45'} }\n```",
