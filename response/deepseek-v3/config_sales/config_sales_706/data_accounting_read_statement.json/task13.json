These are typically non-current assets, which are long-term investments and not part of the operating cycle.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Balance Sheet Structure**:\n   - The balance sheet is divided into current assets and non-current assets.\n   - Current assets are expected to be realized or consumed within the operating cycle (usually one year).\n   - Non-current assets are not expected to be realized or consumed within the operating cycle and include items like fixed assets, long-term investments, etc.\n\n2. **Identify Non-Current Assets**:\n   - In the given balance sheet, the non-current assets are listed under \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation.\"\n   - The \"Total Non-current Assets\" line item summarizes the value of all non-current assets.\n\n3. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The initial value of non-current assets is given as \"5000000.00\" under \"Total Non-current Assets\" for the initial date (2023-12-31).\n   - The end value of non-current assets is given as \"5307107.79\" under \"Total Non-current Assets\" for the end date (2024-01-28).\n\n4. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The initial value matches the \"Fixed Assets\" initial amount (5000000.00) since there is no initial accumulated depreciation.\n   - The end value is calculated as the \"Fixed Assets\" end amount (5352857.55) minus the \"Accumulated Depreciation\" end amount (45749.76), which equals 5307107.79.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5307107.79'} }\n```",
