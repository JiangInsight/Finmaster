This typically refers to the \"Accounts Payable\" line item in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: The amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit is recorded under \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n2. **Locate Accounts Payable in the Balance Sheet**: \n   - Initial amount of Accounts Payable: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n   - End amount of Accounts Payable: 1,820,000.00 (as of 2024-01-28)\n\n3. **Determine the Addition During the Period**: The increase in Accounts Payable during the period is the difference between the end amount and the initial amount. \n   - Increase in Accounts Payable = End amount - Initial amount = 1,820,000.00 - 0.00 = 1,820,000.00\n\n4. **Verify with Cash Flow Statement**: \n   - The cash flow statement also shows the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" as 1,820,000.00, which confirms the addition during the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is 1,820,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1820000.00'}}\n```",
