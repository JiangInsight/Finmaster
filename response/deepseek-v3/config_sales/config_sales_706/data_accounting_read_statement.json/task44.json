The value we are interested in is the \"Ending Balance\" of \"Cash and Cash Equivalents.\"\n2. **Locate the Ending Balance**: In the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, there is a line item labeled \"Ending Balance\" with the value \"9245580.45\" and the date \"2024-01-28.\"\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period is clearly stated as \"9245580.45.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '9245580.45'} }\n```",
