This is typically found under the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Section**: In the provided cash flow statement, the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section contains the line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which represents cash payments for acquiring PP&E and other long-term assets.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is \"352857.55\" as shown in the table.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is \"-352857.55,\" which confirms that the cash outflow for purchasing fixed assets is \"352857.55\" (since the net flow is negative, indicating an outflow).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '352857.55'} }\n```",
