I'm going to go through the balance sheet provided and identify the four specific line items we're interested in, along with their initial and end amounts. \n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract four specific line items from the balance sheet:\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received**: This is typically listed as \"Interest Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n2. **Accumulated depreciation**: This is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life, listed as \"Accumulated Depreciation\".\n3. **Tax payable**: This is the amount of taxes owed but not yet paid, listed as \"Taxes Payable\".\n4. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is the amount shareholders have invested in the company, usually listed as \"Paid-in Capital\".\n\nFor each of these, we'll note the \"Initial_amount\" and \"End_amount\" from the balance sheet.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Balance Sheet\nLet's go through the balance sheet line by line to find these items.\n\n1. **Interest Receivable**:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - End_amount: 10710.07\n\n2. **Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - End_amount: 45749.76\n\n3. **Taxes Payable**:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - End_amount: 290671.05\n\n4. **Paid-in Capital**:\n   - Initial_amount: 13000000.00\n   - End_amount: 13000000.00\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe order in which these items appear in the balance sheet is important, as we need to maintain that order in our output:\n1. Interest Receivable\n2. Accumulated Depreciation\n3. Taxes Payable\n4. Paid-in Capital\n\nThis matches the order in the balance sheet, so we're good.\n\n### Preparing the Solution\nNow, let's map these to the required JSON format:\n- 'initial value1': Interest Receivable initial amount\n- 'end valu1': Interest Receivable end amount\n- 'initial value2': Accumulated Depreciation initial amount\n- 'end valu2': Accumulated Depreciation end amount\n- 'initial value3': Taxes Payable initial amount\n- 'end valu3': Taxes Payable end amount\n- 'initial value4': Paid-in Capital initial amount\n- 'end valu4': Paid-in Capital end amount\n\nFilling in the values:\n- 'initial value1': '0.00'\n- 'end valu1': '10710.07'\n- 'initial value2': '0.00'\n- 'end valu2': '45749.76'\n- 'initial value3': '0.00'\n- 'end valu3': '290671.05'\n- 'initial value4': '13000000.00'\n- 'end valu4': '13000000.00'\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '0.00', 'end valu1': '10710.07', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '45749.76', 'initial value3': '0.00', 'end valu3': '290671.05', 'initial value4': '13000000.00', 'end valu4': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
