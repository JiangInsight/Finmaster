I'm going to break it down to understand what each part is asking for and then find the corresponding values in the given income statement.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task asks us to identify and extract three specific line items from the income statement:\n\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**: This typically refers to the total revenue generated from the main operations of the business. In income statements, this is often labeled as \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is essentially the cost associated with the goods that were sold during the period. In accounting terms, this is known as the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**: These are the expenses related to running the overall operations of the company, not directly tied to production or sales. This is usually labeled as \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n\n### Analyzing the Given Income Statement\n\nLet's look at the provided income statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 5813420.67 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Total Revenue | 5813420.67 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 3175000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Total Cost | 3175000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Gross Profit | 2638420.67 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 191069.49 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Selling Expenses | 731171.32 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Depreciation | 45749.76 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Financial Expenses | 287278.52 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Total Expenses | 1255269.09 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Interest Income | 10710.07 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 1393861.65 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Tax Expense | 290671.05 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Profit | 1103190.60 | 2024-01-28 |\n\n### Identifying the Required Line Items\n\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**:\n   - Both \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\" seem to represent the total income from ordinary activities.\n   - The amounts for both are the same: 5,813,420.67.\n   - Typically, \"Total Revenue\" is the more encompassing term, so we'll use that.\n   - **Value1**: 5813420.67\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period (Cost of Goods Sold)**:\n   - This is directly labeled as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with the amount 3,175,000.00.\n   - **Value2**: 3175000.00\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**:\n   - This is labeled as \"Administrative Expenses\" with the amount 191,069.49.\n   - **Value3**: 191069.49\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example:\n\n- **value1**: '5431018.59' (Total Revenue)\n- **value2**: '4410000.00' (Cost of Goods Sold)\n- **value3**: '1425164.20' (Administrative Expenses)\n\nThis matches our understanding, confirming that:\n- value1 = Total Revenue\n- value2 = Cost of Goods Sold\n- value3 = Administrative Expenses\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the above analysis, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5813420.67', 'value2': '3175000.00', 'value3': '191069.49'} }\n```",
