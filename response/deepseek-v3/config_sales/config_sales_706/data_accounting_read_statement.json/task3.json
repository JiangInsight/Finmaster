This is typically labeled as \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are looking for amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit. This is usually recorded under \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the given balance sheet, we can see the line item \"Accounts Receivable\" with the following details:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - Initial_date: 2023-12-31\n   - End_amount: 1355463.34\n   - End_date: 2024-01-28\n\n3. **Extract the Values**:\n   - The initial value of Accounts Receivable is 0.00.\n   - The end value of Accounts Receivable is 1355463.34.\n\n4. **Verify**: There are no other line items that represent amounts owed for goods or services sold on credit (e.g., \"Notes Receivable\" or \"Trade Receivables\" are not present). Thus, \"Accounts Receivable\" is the correct line item to extract.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1355463.34'} }\n```",
