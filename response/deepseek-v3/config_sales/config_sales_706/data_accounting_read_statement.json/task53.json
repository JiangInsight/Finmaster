The COGS is the correct metric for this task.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The value of the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" from the income statement, which is `3175000.00`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3175000.00'}}\n```",
