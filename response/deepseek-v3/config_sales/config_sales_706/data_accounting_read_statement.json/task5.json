These assets are typically categorized under \"Inventory\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: \n   - The line item \"Inventory\" represents assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured. This is the relevant line item we need to extract.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - From the given balance sheet, locate the \"Inventory\" row.\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for Inventory is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for Inventory is `295000.00` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-01-28`.\n\n3. **Verify the Data**:\n   - Ensure that the \"Inventory\" line item is correctly identified and that the values are accurately extracted from the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '295000.00'} }\n```",
