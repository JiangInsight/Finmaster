                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line item and value that represents the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit during the period. This is typically reflected in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section as \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task is to find the line item that shows the change in accounts receivable, which indicates the decrease (or increase) in amounts owed to the entity for credit sales or services provided.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is present under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities.\"\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with this line item is \"-1355463.34.\" A negative value here indicates an increase in accounts receivable (i.e., amounts owed to the entity have increased), but the absolute value represents the change in amounts owed.\n4. **Determine the Correct Value**: Since the task asks for the \"decrease in amounts owed,\" we would look for a positive value. However, in this case, the value is negative, indicating an increase, not a decrease. But based on the example provided, the solution is the value as it appears in the line item, regardless of whether it's an increase or decrease. \n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1355463.34'}}\n```",
