                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to identify and extract four specific line items from the given cash flow statement based on their descriptions. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Four Line Items to Extract:\n\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**:\n   - This refers to **Depreciation**. It's the method by which the cost of a tangible asset is allocated over its useful life.\n   \n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period**:\n   - This refers to changes in **Inventory**. An increase in inventory means cash is being used to buy more inventory (negative cash flow), and a decrease means inventory is being sold (positive cash flow).\n   \n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends**:\n   - This is the **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**. It includes purchases and sales of long-term assets and investments.\n   \n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**:\n   - This is the **Net Increase** in cash and cash equivalents, which shows the overall change in cash position during the period.\n\n### Locating These Items in the Given Statement:\n\nNow, let's go through the provided cash flow statement and find these items:\n\n1. **Depreciation**:\n   - Looking at the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, there's a line item:\n     - `Depreciation  | 45749.76 | 2024-01-28`\n   - So, `value1` is `45749.76`.\n\n2. **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**:\n   - In the same section, there's:\n     - `(Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -295000.00 | 2024-01-28`\n   - The negative sign indicates an increase in inventory (cash outflow), which matches the description.\n   - So, `value2` is `-295000.00`.\n\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - Under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\", we have:\n     - `Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -352857.55 | 2024-01-28`\n   - This is the net result of investing activities, including purchases of fixed assets.\n   - So, `value3` is `-352857.55`.\n\n4. **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n   - Under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\", there's:\n     - `Net Increase  | 1245580.45 | 2024-01-28`\n   - This shows the total change in cash during the period.\n   - So, `value4` is `1245580.45`.\n\n### Verifying the Order:\n\nThe order in which these values should be presented is as they appear in the input statement's descriptions, which is:\n\n1. Depreciation\n2. (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\n3. Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n4. Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThis matches the order we've extracted them in.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '45749.76', 'value2': '-295000.00', 'value3': '-352857.55', 'value4': '1245580.45'} }\n```",
