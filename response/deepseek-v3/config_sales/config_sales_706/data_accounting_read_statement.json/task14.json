These are typically referred to as \"Current Liabilities\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Liabilities**: \n   - Current liabilities are obligations that are expected to be settled within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually within one year). \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Current Liabilities\" are \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\". The total of these is given under \"Total Current Liabilities\".\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `2110671.05` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-01-28`.\n\n3. **Verify**:\n   - The sum of \"Accounts Payable\" (`1820000.00`) and \"Taxes Payable\" (`290671.05`) equals `2110671.05`, which matches the \"Total Current Liabilities\" value. This confirms the correctness of the extracted values.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '2110671.05'} }\n```",
