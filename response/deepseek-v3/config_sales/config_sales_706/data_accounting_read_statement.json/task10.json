This is typically labeled as \"Paid-in Capital\" in the balance sheet. \n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The balance sheet provided includes a line item called \"Paid-in Capital\" under the \"Owner's Equity\" section. This is the account that represents the capital contributed by shareholders.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial amount for \"Paid-in Capital\" is listed as `13000000.00` with the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end amount for \"Paid-in Capital\" is also listed as `13000000.00` with the end date `2024-01-28`. This indicates that there was no change in the paid-in capital during the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
