I'm going to go through the income statement provided and identify the four specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract four specific items from the income statement:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**: This typically refers to \"Selling Expenses\" because these are costs related to selling products or services, like advertising, sales commissions, and delivery costs.\n   \n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually labeled as \"Financial Expenses\" or \"Interest Expense,\" which are costs related to borrowing money.\n\n3. **The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is straightforward; it's \"Depreciation,\" which accounts for the wear and tear of assets over time.\n\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period**: This is the \"Tax Expense,\" representing the taxes owed for the period.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Income Statement\nLet's look at the provided income statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 5813420.67 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Total Revenue | 5813420.67 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 3175000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Total Cost | 3175000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Gross Profit | 2638420.67 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 191069.49 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Selling Expenses | 731171.32 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Depreciation | 45749.76 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Financial Expenses | 287278.52 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Total Expenses | 1255269.09 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Interest Income | 10710.07 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 1393861.65 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Tax Expense | 290671.05 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Profit | 1103190.60 | 2024-01-28 |\n\nNow, let's identify each of the four required items:\n\n1. **Selling Expenses**: This is directly listed as \"Selling Expenses\" with an amount of `731171.32`.\n   \n2. **Depreciation**: Listed as \"Depreciation\" with an amount of `45749.76`.\n   \n3. **Financial Expenses**: Listed as \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of `287278.52`.\n   \n4. **Tax Expense**: Listed as \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of `290671.05`.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nLooking back at the example provided:\n\n- Selling Expenses: `493854.67` (value1)\n- Depreciation: `45751.41` (value2)\n- Financial Expenses: `432511.69` (value3)\n- Tax Expense: `271550.92` (value4)\n\nThis confirms that the order is:\n1. Selling Expenses\n2. Depreciation\n3. Financial Expenses\n4. Tax Expense\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the above, the values are:\n\n- value1 (Selling Expenses): `731171.32`\n- value2 (Depreciation): `45749.76`\n- value3 (Financial Expenses): `287278.52`\n- value4 (Tax Expense): `290671.05`\n\nSo, the JSON solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '731171.32', 'value2': '45749.76', 'value3': '287278.52', 'value4': '290671.05'} }\n```",
