These are typically referred to as \"Current Assets\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Assets**: Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within one year or the operating cycle of the business, whichever is longer. In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of all such assets.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The initial amount for \"Total Current Assets\" is provided as `8000000.00` on the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n   - **End Value**: The end amount for \"Total Current Assets\" is provided as `10906753.86` on the end date `2024-01-28`.\n\n3. **Verify**: The other line items under \"Current Assets\" (such as Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, Accounts Receivable, and Inventory) are summed up in \"Total Current Assets,\" confirming that this is the correct line item to extract.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10906753.86'} }\n```",
