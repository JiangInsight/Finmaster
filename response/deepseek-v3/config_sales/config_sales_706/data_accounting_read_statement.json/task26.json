In an income statement, these are usually listed under \"Financial Expenses\" or similar terms.\n2. **Analyzing the Given Income Statement**: \n   - The income statement provided includes a line item labeled \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of \"287278.52\".\n   - This line item represents the costs incurred by the enterprise to raise funds for production and operation.\n3. **Verification**:\n   - There are no other line items in the income statement that could represent financing costs (e.g., \"Interest Expense\" is not listed separately).\n   - The \"Financial Expenses\" line is the only relevant entry for this task.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe value of the financing costs is \"287278.52\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '287278.52'} }\n```",
