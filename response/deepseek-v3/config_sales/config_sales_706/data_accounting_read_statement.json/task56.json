This is typically represented by the \"Depreciation\" line item in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Identify Depreciation in the Income Statement**: \n   - In the provided income statement, there is a line item labeled \"Depreciation\" with an amount of \"45749.76\" dated \"2024-01-28\".\n\n2. **Verify in Cash Flow Statement**: \n   - The cash flow statement also lists \"Depreciation\" under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" with the same amount of \"45749.76\" dated \"2024-01-28\". This consistency confirms the value.\n\n3. **Check Accumulated Depreciation in Balance Sheet**: \n   - The balance sheet shows \"Accumulated Depreciation\" under \"Fixed Assets\" with an end amount of \"45749.76\" dated \"2024-01-28\". This matches the depreciation value found in the other statements, indicating it is the cumulative depreciation up to that date.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe value of the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life (depreciation) is \"45749.76\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45749.76'}}\n```",
