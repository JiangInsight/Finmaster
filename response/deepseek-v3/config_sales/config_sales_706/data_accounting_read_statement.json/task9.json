The line item that represents taxes accrued but not yet paid is typically labeled as \"Taxes Payable\" in the liabilities section of the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - Look for the line item labeled \"Taxes Payable\" under the \"Current Liabilities\" section of the balance sheet.\n\n2. **Extract the Initial Value**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\" is the value at the \"Initial_date\" (2023-12-31). In this case, it is `0.00`.\n\n3. **Extract the End Value**:\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\" is the value at the \"End_date\" (2024-01-28). In this case, it is `290671.05`.\n\n4. **Format the Solution**:\n   - Present the extracted values in the required JSON format.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '290671.05'} }\n```",
