                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement extraction task step by step. I'm going to approach this systematically to ensure I extract the correct line items as specified in the task description.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nFirst, let's recap what we need to extract:\n\n1. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is typically referred to as \"Profit Before Tax\" in the income statement.\n2. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This usually refers to the increase in \"Accounts Payable\" from the balance sheet or cash flow statement.\n3. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is the \"Paid-in Capital\" from the balance sheet.\n\nThe outputs should be grouped by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, maintain the original line item order as shown in the input.\n\nGiven the example provided, the order is:\n- Balance Sheet: Paid-in Capital\n- Income Statement: Profit Before Tax\n- Cash Flow Statement: Increase in Accounts Payable\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nNow, let's look at the provided financial statements to find these items.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, we're interested in \"Paid-in Capital\":\n```\nPaid-in Capital | 13000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 13000000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\nThis shows that the paid-in capital remained the same at `13000000.00`.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nNext, from the income statement, we need \"Profit Before Tax\":\n```\nProfit Before Tax | 1393861.65 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\nSo, the profit before tax is `1393861.65`.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nNow, from the cash flow statement, we look for the increase in \"Accounts Payable\":\n```\nIncrease (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 1820000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\nThis indicates an increase in accounts payable of `1820000.00`.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nThe example provided had:\n- value1: Paid-in Capital\n- value2: Profit Before Tax\n- value3: Increase in Accounts Payable\n\nThis matches our current extraction order.\n\n### Potential Confusions\n\nInitially, one might wonder whether to take the \"Accounts Payable\" from the balance sheet or the cash flow statement. The balance sheet shows the ending amount, while the cash flow statement shows the change during the period. Since the task asks for the \"addition\" (i.e., the increase), the cash flow statement's line is more appropriate.\n\nSimilarly, \"Profit Before Tax\" is clearly labeled in the income statement, so that's straightforward.\n\n\"Paid-in Capital\" is clearly listed in the balance sheet with no changes, so we take the ending amount.\n\n### Final Extraction\n\nPutting it all together:\n1. Paid-in Capital: `13000000.00`\n2. Profit Before Tax: `1393861.65`\n3. Increase in Accounts Payable: `1820000.00`\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1393861.65', 'value3': '1820000.00'}}\n```",
