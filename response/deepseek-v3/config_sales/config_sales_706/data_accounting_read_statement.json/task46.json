Specifically, we need to:\n\n1. **Identify the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from investing activities**: This involves looking at the section labeled \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" in the statement.\n2. **Decompose this item into its component sub-items**: In the given examples, the net cash flow from investing activities is broken down into a single sub-item, which is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Problem\n\nLet's look at the cash flow statement provided in the problem:\n\n```plaintext\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Profit  | 1103190.60 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Depreciation  | 45749.76 | 2024-01-28 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -1355463.34 | 2024-01-28 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -10710.07 | 2024-01-28 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -295000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 1820000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 290671.05 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | 1598438.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-01-28 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 352857.55 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -352857.55 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-01-28 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Ending Balance  | 9245580.45 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Increase  | 1245580.45 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\n\n### Extracting the Required Information\n\n1. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - From the table, we can see the line item \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with an amount of `-352857.55`. This is the net amount generated from investing activities.\n\n2. **Sub-items**:\n   - The only sub-item listed under investing activities is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an amount of `352857.55`. \n   - Typically, cash spent on purchasing fixed assets is a cash outflow, which is why it's positive in the sub-item but results in a negative net cash flow from investing activities.\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nThe net cash flow from investing activities is the sum of all investing-related cash flows. Here, it's just the purchase of fixed assets:\n\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: `352857.55` (cash outflow, hence negative impact)\n  \nSo, Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = `-352857.55`\n\nThis matches the given value in the statement.\n\n### Constructing the Solution\n\nBased on the example provided in the task description, the solution should include:\n\n- `value`: The net cash flow from investing activities (`-352857.55`)\n- `sub_items`: A dictionary with the sub-item's value (`352857.55`)\n\nThe example showed the sub_item key as 'sub_item value', so we'll follow that format.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-352857.55', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '352857.55'} }\n```",
