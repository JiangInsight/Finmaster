Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to identify and extract the following three specific line items:\n1. **Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit**: This typically refers to \"Accounts Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet.\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually labeled as \"Financial Expenses\" in the Income Statement.\n3. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is often found as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThe order of extraction should follow the sequence: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### Extracting the Values\n\n1. **Balance Sheet - Accounts Receivable**:\n   - Looking at the Balance Sheet section, we find \"Accounts Receivable\" with an \"End_amount\" of \"1355463.34\".\n   - This is the amount owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit.\n   - **Value1**: \"1355463.34\"\n\n2. **Income Statement - Financial Expenses**:\n   - In the Income Statement, there's a line item \"Financial Expenses\" with an \"Amount\" of \"287278.52\".\n   - This represents the financing costs incurred by the enterprise.\n   - **Value2**: \"287278.52\"\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement - Purchase of Fixed Assets**:\n   - In the Cash Flow Statement, under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\", there's \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an \"Amount\" of \"352857.55\".\n   - This indicates the cash payments made to acquire long-term assets.\n   - **Value3**: \"352857.55\"\n\n### Verifying the Values\nLet me quickly verify each:\n- **Accounts Receivable**: Yes, it's under Balance Sheet, and \"1355463.34\" is the correct end amount.\n- **Financial Expenses**: Confirmed in the Income Statement as \"287278.52\".\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: Correctly listed in the Cash Flow Statement as \"352857.55\".\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1355463.34', 'value2': '287278.52', 'value3': '352857.55'}}\n```",
