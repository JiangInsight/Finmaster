These transactions represent the depreciation expenses recorded during the period.\n\n2. **Initial Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - Since there are no depreciation transactions before the start date (2023-12-31), the initial accumulated depreciation is 0.00.\n\n3. **Final Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - The only depreciation transaction in the provided data is on 2024-01-01 with an amount of 45749.47. This amount is added to the initial accumulated depreciation to get the final accumulated depreciation.\n\n4. **Result**:\n   - Initial Accumulated Depreciation: 0.00\n   - Final Accumulated Depreciation: 45749.47\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accumulated Depreciation End Value': '45749.47'}}\n```",
