                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: Debt to Equity Ratio, Net Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of debt financing relative to equity financing. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 1,493,246.99\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n- **Total Owner's Equity (End_amount):** 13,707,199.17\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{1,493,246.99}{13,707,199.17} \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{1,493,246.99}{13,707,199.17} \\approx 0.1089 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[ \\approx 0.11 \\]\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** 707,199.17\n- **Total Revenue:** 5,064,939.23\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{707,199.17}{5,064,939.23} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nLet's compute:\n\\[ \\frac{707,199.17}{5,064,939.23} \\approx 0.1396 \\]\n\\[ 0.1396 \\times 100\\% \\approx 13.96\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to cover its current liabilities with cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -64,099.10\n- From the balance sheet:\n  - **Total Current Liabilities:** 1,493,246.99\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-64,099.10}{1,493,246.99} \\]\n\nLet's compute:\n\\[ \\frac{-64,099.10}{1,493,246.99} \\approx -0.0429 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[ \\approx -0.04 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Net Profit Margin': '13.96%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.04'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - Liabilities: 1,493,246.99\n   - Equity: 13,707,199.17\n   - 1,493,246.99 / 13,707,199.17 ≈ 0.11 ✔\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - Net Profit: 707,199.17\n   - Revenue: 5,064,939.23\n   - 707,199.17 / 5,064,939.23 ≈ 0.1396 → 13.96% ✔\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -64,099.10\n   - Current Liabilities: 1,493,246.99\n   - -64,099.10 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ -0.04 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The ratios are correctly calculated based on the provided financial statements.",
