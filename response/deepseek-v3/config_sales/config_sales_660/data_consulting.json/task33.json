                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand what each term means and where to find the numbers in the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow from its operating activities. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -64,099.10\nFrom the balance sheet (End_amount):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{-64,099.10}{1,493,246.99} \\approx -0.0429 \\]\n\nThis seems quite low (negative), which might indicate that the company isn't generating enough cash from operations to cover its current liabilities.\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to determine Total Debt. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are:\n- Accounts Payable = 1,240,000.00\n- Taxes Payable = 253,246.99\nTotal Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n\nAssuming there are no long-term debts (since none are listed), Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n\nCalculation:\nSame as Operating Cash Flow Ratio since denominator is the same:\n\\[ \\frac{-64,099.10}{1,493,246.99} \\approx -0.0429 \\]\n\nThis suggests the company's operating cash flow is insufficient to cover its debt.\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 2,735,000.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00\n- Ending Inventory = 450,000.00\n\nAverage Inventory:\n\\[ \\frac{0 + 450,000}{2} = 225,000 \\]\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{2,735,000}{225,000} \\approx 12.16 \\]\n\nThis high ratio indicates that inventory is being sold and replaced very quickly.\n\nWait a minute, in the example provided, the Inventory Turnover Ratio was calculated differently. They seemed to use only the ending inventory, not the average. Maybe the formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Ending Inventory}} \\]\n\nThen:\n\\[ \\frac{2,735,000}{450,000} \\approx 6.08 \\]\n\nThis seems more plausible. Maybe the initial inventory was zero because it's the start of operations, so using ending inventory makes sense here.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio compares a company's total debt to its total equity, showing the proportion of financing that comes from creditors versus shareholders.\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt}}{\\text{Total Equity}} \\]\n\nTotal Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\nTotal Equity (from balance sheet) = 13,707,199.17\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{1,493,246.99}{13,707,199.17} \\approx 0.109 \\]\n\nThis low ratio indicates that the company is primarily financed by equity, not debt.\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets (excluding inventory).\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 4,540,900.90\n- Bank Deposits = 2,866,063.83\n- Interest Receivable = 8,967.44\n- Accounts Receivable = 1,851,327.29\nTotal Quick Assets = 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 + 8,967.44 + 1,851,327.29 = 9,267,259.46\n\nCurrent Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{9,267,259.46}{1,493,246.99} \\approx 6.21 \\]\n\nThis high ratio indicates strong liquidity.\n\nWait, in the example, they didn't include Interest Receivable in the Quick Ratio. Maybe it's just Cash + Accounts Receivable.\n\nThen:\nCash = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits = 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 = 7,406,964.73\nAccounts Receivable = 1,851,327.29\nTotal = 7,406,964.73 + 1,851,327.29 = 9,258,292.02\n\nQuick Ratio:\n\\[ \\frac{9,258,292.02}{1,493,246.99} \\approx 6.20 \\]\n\nVery close to previous, but let's stick to excluding interest receivable unless it's considered a marketable security, which it's not.\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with all current assets.\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 9,717,259.46\n- Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{9,717,259.46}{1,493,246.99} \\approx 6.51 \\]\n\nThis high ratio indicates strong short-term financial health.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the summary:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.04', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.04', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '6.08', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Quick Ratio': '6.20', 'Current Ratio': '6.51'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -64,099.10 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ -0.04\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: Same as above = -0.04\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio: 2,735,000 / 450,000 ≈ 6.08\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 1,493,246.99 / 13,707,199.17 ≈ 0.11\n- Quick Ratio: (7,406,964.73 + 1,851,327.29) / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.20\n- Current Ratio: 9,717,259.46 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.51\n\nAll calculations seem correct based on the provided data and standard financial ratio formulas.",
