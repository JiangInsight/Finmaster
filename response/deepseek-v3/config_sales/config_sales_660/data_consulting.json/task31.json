                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'll go through each ratio one by one, explaining how I arrive at the numbers.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n**Given:**  \n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all Main Business Revenue is credit sales) = 5,064,939.23  \n- Beginning Accounts Receivable = 0.00 (from initial balance sheet)  \n- Ending Accounts Receivable = 1,851,327.29  \n\n**Average Accounts Receivable:**  \n= (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2  \n= (0 + 1,851,327.29) / 2  \n= 925,663.645  \n\n**Calculation:**  \n= 5,064,939.23 / 925,663.645  \n≈ 5.47  \n\n*Wait a minute, in the example provided, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio was calculated as 4.47 with similar data. Maybe they used Ending AR instead of Average AR? Let me check both ways.*\n\n**Alternative (using Ending AR):**  \n= 5,064,939.23 / 1,851,327.29  \n≈ 2.74  \n\nHmm, neither matches the example's method. Maybe the example used Average AR but had different numbers. Given that initial AR was 0, using Average AR seems more appropriate, so I'll stick with 5.47.\n\nBut looking back, in the example, initial AR was 0, end AR was 2,429,482.13, and revenue was 5,431,018.59.  \nAverage AR = (0 + 2,429,482.13)/2 = 1,214,741.065  \nRatio = 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 ≈ 4.47  \nSo they did use Average AR.  \n\nSimilarly here:  \nAverage AR = 925,663.645  \nRatio = 5,064,939.23 / 925,663.645 ≈ 5.47  \n\nSo my calculation seems correct.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n\n**Given:**  \n- Operating Cash Flow (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) = -64,099.10  \n- Current Liabilities (Ending) = 1,493,246.99  \n\n**Calculation:**  \n= -64,099.10 / 1,493,246.99  \n≈ -0.0429  \n\nBut in the example, it was -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.90  \nHere, the ratio is much smaller in magnitude.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis seems identical to the Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the example (both were -3.90 in the example). So:\n\n= -64,099.10 / 1,493,246.99  \n≈ -0.0429  \n\nSame as above.\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = Net Sales / Average Total Assets  \n\n**Given:**  \n- Net Sales (Total Revenue) = 5,064,939.23  \n- Beginning Total Assets = 13,000,000.00  \n- Ending Total Assets = 15,200,446.16  \n\n**Average Total Assets:**  \n= (13,000,000.00 + 15,200,446.16) / 2  \n= 14,100,223.08  \n\n**Calculation:**  \n= 5,064,939.23 / 14,100,223.08  \n≈ 0.359  \n\nIn the example:  \nRevenue = 5,431,018.59  \nAvg Assets = (13,000,000 + 13,216,409.49)/2 = 13,108,204.745  \nRatio = 5,431,018.59 / 13,108,204.745 ≈ 0.41  \nSo similar method here gives ≈ 0.36.\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity  \n\n**Given:**  \n- Total Liabilities (Ending Current Liabilities) = 1,493,246.99  \n- Total Shareholders' Equity (Ending) = 13,707,199.17  \n\n**Calculation:**  \n= 1,493,246.99 / 13,707,199.17  \n≈ 0.109  \n\nIn the example:  \nLiabilities = 1,861,550.92  \nEquity = 11,354,858.57  \nRatio = 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.16  \nSo similar method here gives ≈ 0.11.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '5.47', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-0.04', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.04', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.36', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11'}}\n```\n\n*Wait, let me double-check the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio calculation because the example had a lower ratio with higher AR.*\n\nGiven:\n- Revenue = 5,064,939.23\n- Beginning AR = 0, Ending AR = 1,851,327.29\nAverage AR = (0 + 1,851,327.29)/2 = 925,663.645\nRatio = 5,064,939.23 / 925,663.645 ≈ 5.47\n\nThis seems correct. Maybe the example had higher AR relative to sales, leading to a lower ratio. Here, AR is smaller relative to sales, so higher ratio makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, Operating Cash Flow ratios are much smaller in magnitude because the operating cash flow is a much smaller negative number relative to current liabilities.\n\nTotal Asset Turnover is slightly lower here because average assets are higher relative to sales.\n\nDebt to Equity is lower here because liabilities are smaller relative to equity.\n\nEverything checks out. Final answer is correct.",
