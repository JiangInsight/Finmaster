                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the required ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount): 9,717,259.46\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount): 1,493,246.99\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 9,717,259.46 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.51\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n**Formula:** (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit: 2,329,939.23\n- Total Revenue: 5,064,939.23\n\nCalculation:\nGross Profit Margin = (2,329,939.23 / 5,064,939.23) * 100 ≈ 46.00%\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities: Total Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99 (since no non-current liabilities are listed)\n- Total Assets: 15,200,446.16\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 1,493,246.99 / 15,200,446.16 ≈ 0.098 or 9.8%\n\nBut looking at the example, it seems they might have considered only current liabilities for debt. Alternatively, if total liabilities are only current, then it's correct as is.\n\n### 4. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:** (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit: 707,199.17\n- Total Revenue: 5,064,939.23\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (707,199.17 / 5,064,939.23) * 100 ≈ 13.96%\n\n### 5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand: 4,540,900.90\n- Bank Deposits: 2,866,063.83\n- Total Cash and Equivalents: 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 = 7,406,964.73\n- Current Liabilities: 1,493,246.99\n\nCalculation:\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = 7,406,964.73 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 4.96\n\n### 6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -64,099.10\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -528,936.17\n- FCF = Operating Cash Flow + Investing Cash Flow = -64,099.10 + (-528,936.17) = -593,035.27\n\nAlternatively, the \"Net Increase\" in cash is -593,035.27, which matches the sum above.\n\n### 7. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:** (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Profit: 707,199.17\n- Total Assets (End_amount): 15,200,446.16\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (707,199.17 / 15,200,446.16) * 100 ≈ 4.65%\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '6.51', 'Gross Profit Margin': '46.00%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Net Profit Margin': '13.96%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '4.96', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-593035.27', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '4.65%'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check the Debt to Asset Ratio since the example had a different approach. In the given data, the only liabilities listed are current liabilities (Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable summing to Total Current Liabilities). There are no non-current liabilities mentioned. Therefore, Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99.\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 1,493,246.99 / 15,200,446.16 ≈ 0.098, which rounds to 0.10 when expressed to two decimal places.\n\nAll other calculations seem correct based on the provided data and standard financial formulas.",
