                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate the Quick Ratio and the Net Profit Margin based on the provided financial statements. \n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\n**Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):**\nThis measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets} - \\text{Inventory}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**Net Profit Margin:**\nThis shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n### Extracting Necessary Data from the Problem\n\nLet's pull out the relevant numbers from the given financial statements.\n\n**From the Balance Sheet (End Amounts for 2024-01-29):**\n- Cash on Hand: 4,540,900.90\n- Bank Deposits: 2,866,063.83\n- Interest Receivable: 8,967.44\n- Accounts Receivable: 1,851,327.29\n- Inventory: 450,000.00\n- Total Current Assets: 9,717,259.46\n- Accounts Payable: 1,240,000.00\n- Taxes Payable: 253,246.99\n- Total Current Liabilities: 1,493,246.99\n\n**From the Income Statement:**\n- Total Revenue: 5,064,939.23\n- Net Profit: 707,199.17\n\n### Calculating the Quick Ratio\n\nFirst, identify the liquid current assets (excluding inventory):\n- Cash on Hand\n- Bank Deposits\n- Interest Receivable\n- Accounts Receivable\n\nAdding these up:\n\\[ 4,540,900.90 (\\text{Cash}) + 2,866,063.83 (\\text{Bank}) + 8,967.44 (\\text{Interest}) + 1,851,327.29 (\\text{Receivables}) \\]\n\\[ = 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 = 7,406,964.73 \\]\n\\[ + 8,967.44 = 7,415,932.17 \\]\n\\[ + 1,851,327.29 = 9,267,259.46 \\]\n\nWait a minute, the Total Current Assets is 9,717,259.46, and we have Inventory as 450,000.00. So:\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets} - \\text{Inventory} = 9,717,259.46 - 450,000 = 9,267,259.46 \\]\nThis matches our addition above, so the quick assets are 9,267,259.46.\n\nCurrent Liabilities are 1,493,246.99.\n\nNow, Quick Ratio:\n\\[ \\frac{9,267,259.46}{1,493,246.99} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ 9,267,259.46 ÷ 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.206 \\]\n\nWait, that seems quite high. Let me double-check the components.\n\nActually, looking back, the quick assets typically exclude inventory, which we've done, but also sometimes exclude other less liquid items. However, in the given example, the quick ratio was calculated using (Cash + Bank + Receivables) / Current Liabilities, excluding inventory.\n\nBut in our case, the Total Current Assets is already given as 9,717,259.46, which includes:\n- Cash on Hand: 4,540,900.90\n- Bank Deposits: 2,866,063.83\n- Interest Receivable: 8,967.44\n- Accounts Receivable: 1,851,327.29\n- Inventory: 450,000.00\nAdding these: \n4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 = 7,406,964.73\n+ 8,967.44 = 7,415,932.17\n+ 1,851,327.29 = 9,267,259.46\n+ 450,000 = 9,717,259.46 (matches)\n\nSo quick assets = Total Current Assets - Inventory = 9,267,259.46\nCurrent Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n\nQuick Ratio = 9,267,259.46 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.21\n\nBut the example had a quick ratio of 1.54, which is much lower. Maybe the quick assets are only Cash + Bank + Receivables, excluding Interest Receivable.\n\nLet me see the example's calculation:\n\nExample's Quick Assets:\nCash on Hand: 270,005.90\nBank Deposits: 164,645.57\nAccounts Receivable: 2,429,482.13\nTotal: 270,005.90 + 164,645.57 = 434,651.47 + 2,429,482.13 = 2,864,133.60\nCurrent Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\nQuick Ratio: 2,864,133.60 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54\n\nSo in the example, Interest Receivable was excluded from quick assets. Maybe it's considered less liquid.\n\nSo for our problem, quick assets should be:\nCash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable\n= 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 + 1,851,327.29\n= 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 = 7,406,964.73\n+ 1,851,327.29 = 9,258,292.02\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 1,493,246.99\n\nQuick Ratio = 9,258,292.02 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.20\n\nStill high. Maybe only Cash + Bank, excluding receivables?\n\nExample included receivables. Maybe the initial calculation was correct at 6.20, but that seems unusually high. Alternatively, maybe the current liabilities are higher.\n\nWait, in the example, total current liabilities were accounts payable + taxes payable, which is the same here.\n\nPerhaps the quick ratio is indeed that high due to high cash and receivables relative to liabilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the quick assets are only Cash + Bank, excluding receivables and interest.\n\nLet's try that:\nCash + Bank = 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 = 7,406,964.73\nQuick Ratio = 7,406,964.73 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 4.96\n\nStill high. Maybe only Cash.\n\nCash = 4,540,900.90\nQuick Ratio = 4,540,900.90 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 3.04\n\nThis is getting lower, but the example included receivables.\n\nGiven that, the most likely correct quick assets are Cash + Bank + Receivables, excluding interest and inventory, giving 9,258,292.02 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.20\n\nBut since the example's quick ratio was 1.54 with similar components, maybe there's a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the current liabilities are understated. But they seem correctly summed as accounts payable + taxes payable.\n\nGiven that, I think the quick ratio is indeed approximately 6.20, but since the example had a lower one, perhaps the correct interpretation is to include all current assets except inventory, which would be:\n\nTotal Current Assets - Inventory = 9,717,259.46 - 450,000 = 9,267,259.46\nCurrent Liabilities: 1,493,246.99\nQuick Ratio = 9,267,259.46 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.21\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with this, but it seems unusually high. Maybe the company is very liquid.\n\n### Calculating Net Profit Margin\n\nThis is straightforward:\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ = \\left( \\frac{707,199.17}{5,064,939.23} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nCalculating:\n707,199.17 / 5,064,939.23 ≈ 0.1396\n0.1396 × 100 ≈ 13.96%\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter careful consideration, the calculations are:\n\n- Quick Ratio: 9,267,259.46 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.21\n- Net Profit Margin: (707,199.17 / 5,064,939.23) * 100 ≈ 13.96%\n\nHowever, the quick ratio seems unusually high compared to the example. Maybe the correct quick assets are only Cash + Bank + Receivables, excluding Interest Receivable, which would be:\n\nCash on Hand: 4,540,900.90\nBank Deposits: 2,866,063.83\nAccounts Receivable: 1,851,327.29\nTotal: 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 = 7,406,964.73 + 1,851,327.29 = 9,258,292.02\nQuick Ratio: 9,258,292.02 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.20\n\nGiven that, and since the example included receivables in quick assets, I'll go with:\n\nQuick Ratio: 6.20\nNet Profit Margin: 13.96%\n\nBut the example had quick ratio as '1.54' and net profit margin as '-30.29%', formatted with two decimal places and percentage for margin. So formatting similarly:\n\nQuick Ratio: '6.20'\nNet Profit Margin: '13.96%'\n\nHowever, looking back, the example's quick ratio was likely calculated as (Cash + Bank + Receivables) / Current Liabilities, which for our case is:\n\nCash on Hand: 4,540,900.90\nBank Deposits: 2,866,063.83\nAccounts Receivable: 1,851,327.29\nTotal: 9,258,292.02\nCurrent Liabilities: 1,493,246.99\nQuick Ratio: 9,258,292.02 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.20\n\nGiven that, unless there's a different definition, this seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, net profit margin is correctly calculated as 13.96%.\n\n### Final JSON Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '6.20', 'Net Profit Margin': '13.96%'} }\n```",
