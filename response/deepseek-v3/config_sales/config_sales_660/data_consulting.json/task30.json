                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 9,717,259.46\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 1,493,246.99\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 9,717,259.46 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.51\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand (End_amount) = 4,540,900.90\n- Bank Deposits (End_amount) = 2,866,063.83\n- Interest Receivable (End_amount) = 8,967.44\n- Accounts Receivable (End_amount) = 1,851,327.29\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 + 8,967.44 + 1,851,327.29 ≈ 9,267,259.46\n\nQuick Ratio = 9,267,259.46 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.21\n\n*Note:* Sometimes interest receivable might not be included in quick assets, but since it's a short-term receivable, I included it. If excluded, quick assets would be 9,258,292.02, giving a quick ratio of ≈6.20. The difference is minimal here.\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 1,493,246.99\n- Total Assets (End_amount) = 15,200,446.16\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 1,493,246.99 / 15,200,446.16 ≈ 0.098 or 0.10\n\n*Note:* If there are no other liabilities besides current liabilities, this is correct. Sometimes \"Debt\" refers to interest-bearing liabilities, but here all liabilities seem to be accounted for in current liabilities.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n- Total Owner's Equity (End_amount) = 13,707,199.17\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 1,493,246.99 / 13,707,199.17 ≈ 0.109 or 0.11\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -64,099.10\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -64,099.10 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ -0.043 or -0.04\n\n*Note:* A negative ratio indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative relative to its debt, which isn't ideal.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '6.51', 'Quick Ratio': '6.21', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.04'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check the calculations quickly:\n\n1. Current Ratio: 9,717,259.46 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.51 ✔\n2. Quick Ratio: (4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 + 8,967.44 + 1,851,327.29) / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 9,267,259.46 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.21 ✔\n3. Debt to Asset: 1,493,246.99 / 15,200,446.16 ≈ 0.10 ✔\n4. Debt to Equity: 1,493,246.99 / 13,707,199.17 ≈ 0.11 ✔\n5. Cash Flow to Debt: -64,099.10 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ -0.04 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The company has strong liquidity ratios (high current and quick ratios), low leverage (low debt ratios), but negative operating cash flow relative to debt, which could be a concern if sustained.",
