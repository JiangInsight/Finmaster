                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio, the Current Assets Turnover Ratio, and the Quick Ratio.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures how much cash flow is generated from operating activities relative to the net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -64,099.10\n- Net Profit = 707,199.17\n\nWait a minute, the net cash flow from operating activities is negative, and net profit is positive. That seems unusual because typically, if a company is profitable, you'd expect positive operating cash flow unless there are significant non-cash expenses or changes in working capital that are consuming cash.\n\nBut let's plug in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-64,099.10}{707,199.17} \\approx -0.0906 \\]\n\nThis negative ratio suggests that despite having a positive net income, the company's operating activities are consuming cash, which could be due to increases in accounts receivable, inventory, etc., as seen in the cash flow statement.\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the ratio was positive even when net income was negative, suggesting that the absolute value might be considered. But in finance, negative ratios can be meaningful, indicating a disconnect between earnings and cash flow.\n\nBut the example shows:\n\nNet Profit: -1,645,141.43\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,259,994.10\nRatio: 4.41\n\nThis implies they took the absolute value and divided operating cash flow by net income (ignoring signs):\n\n7,259,994.10 / 1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41\n\nSo, applying the same approach here:\n\nAbsolute Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: 64,099.10\nNet Profit: 707,199.17\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{64,099.10}{707,199.17} \\approx 0.0906 \\]\n\nBut this seems very low compared to the example. Maybe the correct interpretation is to take the absolute value of the ratio itself, not the components. But given the example, it seems they took absolute operating cash flow divided by absolute net income, regardless of signs.\n\nSo, absolute values:\n\nOperating Cash Flow: 64,099.10\nNet Income: 707,199.17\n\nRatio = 64,099.10 / 707,199.17 ≈ 0.0906\n\nBut the example had a higher ratio with larger numbers. Maybe it's correct as is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is supposed to show how many times the operating cash flow covers the net income, hence absolute values make sense to show the magnitude regardless of direction.\n\nSo, we'll proceed with:\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = |Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities| / |Net Profit| = 64,099.10 / 707,199.17 ≈ 0.09\n\nBut the example had 4.41, which is >1, so maybe it's Operating Cash Flow / Net Income with signs, but then negative would make sense in our case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is Net Income / Operating Cash Flow, but that would give a large number in the example.\n\nGiven the confusion, let's assume it's |Operating Cash Flow| / |Net Income|:\n\n= 64,099.10 / 707,199.17 ≈ 0.09\n\nBut the example suggests it can be higher than 1, so maybe it's Operating Cash Flow / Net Income with signs, but then the example would be negative.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct interpretation is Operating Cash Flow / Net Income, keeping signs:\n\n= -64,099.10 / 707,199.17 ≈ -0.09\n\nBut the example was positive, so maybe absolute.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and since the example shows a positive ratio despite both being negative, perhaps it's absolute values.\n\nSo, final answer: 0.09\n\nBut looking at the numbers, operating cash flow is much smaller than net income here, unlike the example where it was larger.\n\nMaybe the formula is Operating Cash Flow / Net Income, and the example had -7.2M / -1.6M = +4.41\n\nSimilarly, here: -64,099.10 / 707,199.17 = -0.09\n\nBut the example was positive, so maybe absolute.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the ratio is always presented as positive, taking absolute values.\n\nThus, 64,099.10 / 707,199.17 ≈ 0.09\n\nBut the example had 4.41, which is >1, suggesting that sometimes it's higher.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's indeed Operating Cash Flow / Net Income with signs, and the ratio can be negative or positive.\n\nBut the example shows positive, so maybe absolute.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll go with absolute values: 0.09\n\nBut the example's calculation seems to be:\n\nOperating Cash Flow: -7,259,994.10\nNet Income: -1,645,141.43\nRatio: 7,259,994.10 / 1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41\n\nSo, absolute values.\n\nThus, here:\n\nOperating Cash Flow: -64,099.10 → 64,099.10\nNet Income: 707,199.17 → 707,199.17\nRatio: 64,099.10 / 707,199.17 ≈ 0.09\n\nSo, the ratio is 0.09.\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}} \\]\n\nWhere Average Current Assets = (Beginning Current Assets + Ending Current Assets) / 2\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Current Assets (Beginning) = 8,000,000.00\n- End Total Current Assets (Ending) = 9,717,259.46\n\nAverage Current Assets = (8,000,000.00 + 9,717,259.46) / 2 = 17,717,259.46 / 2 = 8,858,629.73\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 5,064,939.23\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{5,064,939.23}{8,858,629.73} \\approx 0.57 \\]\n\nLooking at the example, their ratio was 0.68 with similar magnitudes, so this seems reasonable.\n\n### 3. Quick Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nWhere Quick Assets = Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable\n(Here, we'll consider Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, and Accounts Receivable)\n\nFrom the balance sheet (End amounts):\n- Cash on Hand = 4,540,900.90\n- Bank Deposits = 2,866,063.83\n- Accounts Receivable = 1,851,327.29\n- Interest Receivable = 8,967.44 (usually considered quick, but sometimes excluded; we'll include it for thoroughness)\n\nQuick Assets = 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 + 1,851,327.29 + 8,967.44 ≈ 9,267,259.46\n\nCurrent Liabilities (End Total Current Liabilities) = 1,493,246.99\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{9,267,259.46}{1,493,246.99} \\approx 6.21 \\]\n\nWait, this seems very high compared to the example's 1.54. Maybe I included too much in quick assets.\n\nTypically, quick assets exclude inventory and sometimes other current assets. The main components are cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable.\n\nHere, Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable = 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 + 1,851,327.29 = 9,258,291.92\n\nInterest Receivable is usually quick, but sometimes excluded. Let's exclude it for a more conservative estimate.\n\nQuick Assets = 9,258,291.92\nQuick Ratio = 9,258,291.92 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.20\n\nStill very high. Maybe the example included only Cash and Bank Deposits as quick assets, excluding receivables.\n\nIf we exclude Accounts Receivable:\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits = 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 = 7,406,964.73\nQuick Ratio = 7,406,964.73 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 4.96\n\nStill high. Maybe only Cash and Bank Deposits are considered, and the rest are not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the quick assets are Total Current Assets minus Inventory.\n\nTotal Current Assets = 9,717,259.46\nInventory = 450,000.00\nQuick Assets = 9,717,259.46 - 450,000.00 = 9,267,259.46\nQuick Ratio = 9,267,259.46 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.21\n\nThis matches the first calculation.\n\nGiven that the example's quick ratio was 1.54, and their quick assets were likely Cash + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable (since inventory was subtracted from current assets to get quick assets), perhaps the same applies here.\n\nGiven that, the quick ratio is indeed very high at ~6.21, indicating strong liquidity.\n\nBut to match the example's approach, let's see their numbers:\n\nFrom the example:\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable\n= 270,005.90 + 164,645.57 + 2,429,482.13 + 2,672.87 = 2,866,806.47\nCurrent Liabilities = 1,861,550.92\nQuick Ratio = 2,866,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54\n\nSo, same approach here:\n\nQuick Assets = 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 + 1,851,327.29 + 8,967.44 = 9,267,259.46\nCurrent Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\nQuick Ratio = 9,267,259.46 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.21\n\nThis seems correct based on the example's method, even though it's unusually high. Maybe the company has a lot of liquid assets relative to liabilities.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating each ratio:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: | -64,099.10 | / | 707,199.17 | ≈ 0.09\n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio: 5,064,939.23 / 8,858,629.73 ≈ 0.57\n3. Quick Ratio: 9,267,259.46 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.21\n\nHowever, the quick ratio seems unusually high. Rechecking the components, if we exclude Interest Receivable:\n\nQuick Assets = 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 + 1,851,327.29 = 9,258,291.92\nQuick Ratio = 9,258,291.92 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.20\n\nStill high. Maybe the correct interpretation is to exclude Accounts Receivable, considering only Cash and Cash Equivalents (Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits):\n\nQuick Assets = 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 = 7,406,964.73\nQuick Ratio = 7,406,964.73 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 4.96\n\nStill high. Alternatively, perhaps the quick assets are Total Current Assets minus Inventory:\n\nTotal Current Assets = 9,717,259.46\nInventory = 450,000.00\nQuick Assets = 9,267,259.46\nQuick Ratio = 9,267,259.46 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.21\n\nGiven that the example included receivables in quick assets, the first calculation seems correct, even if high.\n\nThus, the final ratios are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '0.09', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.57', 'Quick Ratio': '6.21'} }\n```\n\nBut the quick ratio seems too high compared to the example's 1.54. Maybe there's a mistake in identifying quick assets. If we consider only Cash and Bank Deposits as quick assets (excluding receivables):\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits = 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 = 7,406,964.73\nQuick Ratio = 7,406,964.73 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 4.96\n\nStill high. Maybe the correct quick assets are Cash + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable:\n\n= 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 + 1,851,327.29 = 9,258,291.92\nQuick Ratio = 9,258,291.92 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.20\n\nGiven that, and the example's method, the quick ratio is indeed ~6.21.\n\nHowever, looking back, the example's quick assets were:\n\nCash on Hand: 270,005.90\nBank Deposits: 164,645.57\nAccounts Receivable: 2,429,482.13\nInterest Receivable: 2,672.87\nTotal: 2,866,806.47\nCurrent Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\nQuick Ratio: 2,866,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54\n\nSimilarly here:\n\nCash on Hand: 4,540,900.90\nBank Deposits: 2,866,063.83\nAccounts Receivable: 1,851,327.29\nInterest Receivable: 8,967.44\nTotal: 9,267,259.46\nCurrent Liabilities: 1,493,246.99\nQuick Ratio: 9,267,259.46 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.21\n\nThis seems correct based on the example's method. The high ratio indicates that the company has a lot of liquid assets compared to its current liabilities, which is a sign of strong liquidity.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '0.09', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.57', 'Quick Ratio': '6.21'} }\n```",
