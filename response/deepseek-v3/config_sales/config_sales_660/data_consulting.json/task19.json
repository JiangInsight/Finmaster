                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate both the Current Ratio and the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: This measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its current assets. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: This shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n   \\]\n   Since we only have the ending inventory (no beginning inventory is given except zero at the initial date), we'll assume the average inventory is the ending inventory for this period.\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n\n- **Total Current Assets (End_amount)**: 9,717,259.46\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount)**: 1,493,246.99\n- **Inventory (End_amount)**: 450,000.00\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: 2,735,000.00\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{9,717,259.46}{1,493,246.99}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9,717,259.46}{1,493,246.99} \\approx 6.51\n\\]\n\nSo, the Current Ratio is approximately **6.51**.\n\n### Calculating the Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\nSince the initial inventory was 0.00 and the ending inventory is 450,000.00, the average inventory is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{0 + 450,000}{2} = 225,000\n\\]\n\nBut since the initial inventory was zero and the entire inventory was presumably acquired during the period, using the ending inventory might be more appropriate here to avoid division by zero or very high turnover. Alternatively, if we consider that the inventory was zero at the start and 450,000 at the end, and all purchases were during the period, the average inventory could be considered as the ending inventory for this scenario.\n\nHowever, a more accurate approach is to use the ending inventory if beginning inventory is zero, as the average would be half of ending inventory, but this might not reflect the actual turnover if inventory was built up during the period.\n\nGiven that, let's use the ending inventory:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Ending Inventory}} = \\frac{2,735,000}{450,000} \\approx 6.08\n\\]\n\nBut this seems high, indicating inventory was turned over more than 6 times in a month, which might not be realistic. Alternatively, if we consider that the inventory was zero at the start and all inventory was purchased during the period, the average inventory is indeed the ending inventory divided by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{0 + 450,000}{2} = 225,000\n\\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{2,735,000}{225,000} \\approx 12.16\n\\]\n\nThis seems extremely high for a monthly turnover. Maybe the initial inventory is not zero, but the table shows initial inventory as zero. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, and considering standard practice where beginning inventory is zero, using ending inventory might be more appropriate to avoid inflating the ratio. So, using ending inventory:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{2,735,000}{450,000} \\approx 6.08\n\\]\n\nBut looking back at the example provided, the initial inventory was also zero, and they calculated Inventory Turnover as 1.73, which suggests they might have used the ending inventory directly without averaging (since averaging would give a higher ratio). \n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct approach is to use the ending inventory as the denominator, especially if the period is short (like a month), and inventory was built up during that period.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{2,735,000}{450,000} \\approx 6.08\n\\]\n\nBut the example had:\n\nCost of Goods Sold = 4,410,000\nInventory = 5,090,000\nInventory Turnover = 1.73\n\nWait, 4,410,000 / 5,090,000 ≈ 0.87, not 1.73. Hmm, maybe they used average inventory where beginning was zero and ending was 5,090,000, so average is 2,545,000, then 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73.\n\nAh, so they did use average inventory (beginning + ending)/2.\n\nSo in our case:\n\nBeginning inventory = 0\nEnding inventory = 450,000\nAverage inventory = (0 + 450,000)/2 = 225,000\nCost of Goods Sold = 2,735,000\nInventory Turnover = 2,735,000 / 225,000 ≈ 12.16\n\nBut this seems too high for a month. Maybe the period is annual, but dates suggest it's a month. Alternatively, maybe the initial inventory is not zero, but the table shows initial as zero.\n\nGiven the example uses average inventory, let's do the same:\n\nAverage Inventory = (0 + 450,000)/2 = 225,000\nInventory Turnover = 2,735,000 / 225,000 ≈ 12.16\n\nBut this seems unrealistic. Maybe the initial inventory is not zero, but the table shows initial as zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the inventory was zero at the very start, and the ending is after purchases and sales, so average is more representative.\n\nGiven that, and following the example's method, we'll use average inventory.\n\nSo:\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 2,735,000 / 225,000 ≈ 12.16\n\nBut this seems too high, so perhaps there's a misinterpretation. Maybe the initial inventory is not zero, but the table shows initial as zero. \n\nGiven the data, and following the example's approach, we'll proceed with average inventory.\n\n### Final Calculations\n\n1. **Current Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9,717,259.46}{1,493,246.99} \\approx 6.51\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2,735,000}{225,000} \\approx 12.16\n   \\]\n\nHowever, given that the example had a similar situation with initial inventory at zero and calculated Inventory Turnover as 1.73 (using average inventory), it's likely that the period is such that the inventory was not zero for the entire period, making average inventory appropriate.\n\nGiven that, and since our calculation gives 12.16, which seems high, but mathematically correct based on the data, we'll proceed with that.\n\nBut looking back, in the example:\n\nCost of Goods Sold = 4,410,000\nAverage Inventory = (0 + 5,090,000)/2 = 2,545,000\nInventory Turnover = 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73\n\nSimilarly here:\n\nCost of Goods Sold = 2,735,000\nAverage Inventory = (0 + 450,000)/2 = 225,000\nInventory Turnover = 2,735,000 / 225,000 ≈ 12.16\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that perhaps the initial inventory is not zero in reality, but the table shows it as zero. Maybe the initial_amount is not the beginning of the period but some other reference. \n\nGiven the data strictly, and following the example's method, the calculation is correct as above.\n\nBut to match realistic expectations, perhaps the initial inventory is not zero, but the table shows it as zero. Maybe it's a reporting artifact where initial is not the actual beginning inventory for the period.\n\nGiven that, and since the example used average inventory, we'll do the same.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '6.51', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '12.16'} }\n```\n\nHowever, given that the example had a similar scenario and the Inventory Turnover was lower, it's possible that the initial inventory is not zero for the turnover calculation. Maybe the initial_amount in the balance sheet is not the beginning inventory for the period. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the inventory was zero at the very beginning and all inventory was purchased during the period, then the high turnover makes sense because the company sold a lot relative to the inventory it held at the end.\n\nGiven that, and since the data shows initial inventory as zero, we'll stick with the calculation.\n\nBut to be safe, let's check if there's another way to interpret inventory turnover. Maybe the period is annual, but dates suggest it's a month (from Dec 31 to Jan 29).\n\nGiven that, a monthly inventory turnover of 12.16 would imply an annualized turnover of about 12.16 * 12 = 146, which is unrealistic. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Cost of Goods Sold is for the entire year, and the inventory is end-of-year. Then the turnover would be based on annual COGS and average inventory.\n\nBut the dates suggest it's a monthly period.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and following the example's method strictly, the calculation is as above.\n\nBut perhaps the initial_amount is not the beginning inventory for the period, but some other reference. Maybe the beginning inventory is not zero, but the table shows initial_amount as zero.\n\nGiven that, and without additional information, we'll proceed with the calculation based on the given data.\n\n### Re-evaluating Inventory Turnover\n\nGiven that the initial inventory is zero and ending is 450,000, and COGS is 2,735,000, it implies that the company sold much more than the inventory it had at the end, suggesting that inventory was turned over multiple times during the period.\n\nThus, the high turnover ratio might be correct in this context.\n\n### Final Confirmation\n\nGiven the data:\n\n- COGS = 2,735,000\n- Beginning Inventory = 0\n- Ending Inventory = 450,000\n- Average Inventory = (0 + 450,000)/2 = 225,000\n- Inventory Turnover = 2,735,000 / 225,000 ≈ 12.16\n\nThis seems mathematically correct based on the provided data, even if it seems high.\n\nSimilarly, Current Ratio:\n\n- Current Assets = 9,717,259.46\n- Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n- Current Ratio = 9,717,259.46 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.51\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '6.51', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '12.16'} }\n```\n\nHowever, given that the example had initial inventory as zero and calculated Inventory Turnover as 1.73 (using average inventory), and our calculation gives 12.16, which seems inconsistent, perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Inventory Turnover is calculated as COGS / Ending Inventory, not average inventory.\n\nIf we do that:\n\nInventory Turnover = 2,735,000 / 450,000 ≈ 6.08\n\nThis is still higher than the example's 1.73.\n\nGiven that, and since the example used average inventory (leading to 1.73), and we're doing the same method, our answer is 12.16.\n\nPerhaps the period in the example was longer, making turnover lower. Here, it's a month, so higher turnover is plausible.\n\nThus, sticking with the calculation:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '6.51', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '12.16'} }\n```",
