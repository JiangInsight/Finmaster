In this case, it is `-64099.10`.\n\n2. **Identify the Total Debt**: The total debt is represented by the Total Current Liabilities in the balance sheet, which is `1493246.99`.\n\n3. **Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the numbers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-64099.10}{1493246.99} \\approx -0.0429\n   \\]\n   Rounding to two decimal places, this is `-0.04`.\n\n4. **Present the Answer**: The final answer is presented in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.04'} }\n```",
