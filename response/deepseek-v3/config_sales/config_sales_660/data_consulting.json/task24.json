                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate two ratios: the Debt to Asset Ratio and the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio**: This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio**: This ratio compares the cash generated from operations to the net income, indicating how much cash is generated per dollar of net income. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}}\n   \\]\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the provided financial statements, let's identify the numbers we need.\n\n#### Balance Sheet (End of Period - 2024-01-29)\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 1,493,246.99\n  - This includes:\n    - Accounts Payable: 1,240,000.00\n    - Taxes Payable: 253,246.99\n- **Total Owner's Equity**: 13,707,199.17\n- **Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity**: 15,200,446.16\n  - This should equal Total Assets, which is also: 15,200,446.16\n\nWait a minute, the balance sheet shows \"Total Current Liabilities\" as 1,493,246.99, and there's no mention of long-term liabilities. So, the total liabilities are just the current liabilities in this case.\n\n#### Cash Flow Statement\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -64,099.10\n- **Net Profit (from Income Statement)**: 707,199.17\n\n#### Income Statement\n- Confirmed **Net Profit**: 707,199.17\n\n### Calculating the Ratios\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Liabilities} = \\text{Total Current Liabilities} = 1,493,246.99\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Assets} = 15,200,446.16\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{1,493,246.99}{15,200,446.16} \\approx 0.09824 \\text{ or } 0.10 \\text{ when rounded to two decimal places}\n   \\]\n   \n   Wait, in the example provided, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated as 0.14, but their total liabilities were 1,861,550.92 and total assets were 13,216,409.49, which is indeed ~0.14. Here, our liabilities are less relative to assets, so 0.10 seems correct.\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} = -64,099.10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Profit} = 707,199.17\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-64,099.10}{707,199.17} \\approx -0.0906 \\text{ or } -0.09 \\text{ when rounded to two decimal places}\n   \\]\n   \n   Hmm, in the example, the operating cash flow was negative and net income was negative, resulting in a positive ratio (4.41). Here, operating cash flow is negative and net income is positive, so the ratio is negative. That makes sense because they're moving in opposite directions.\n\n### Verifying Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't miss anything.\n\n- **Total Liabilities**: Only current liabilities are present, totaling 1,493,246.99.\n- **Total Assets**: 15,200,446.16.\n  - Debt to Asset Ratio: 1,493,246.99 / 15,200,446.16 ≈ 0.098 → 0.10\n- Operating Cash Flow: -64,099.10\n- Net Income: 707,199.17\n  - Ratio: -64,099.10 / 707,199.17 ≈ -0.0906 → -0.09\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.09'}}\n```",
