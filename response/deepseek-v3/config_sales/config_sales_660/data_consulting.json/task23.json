                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial task step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods.\n   \n   Formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: This ratio indicates a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It shows how many times the company can pay off its debt with its cash flow from operations.\n   \n   Formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   \n   *Note*: Sometimes, \"Total Debt\" can be interpreted as \"Total Liabilities\" if specific debt figures aren't provided. Here, we'll use \"Total Current Liabilities\" since that's the debt-like obligation shown in the balance sheet.\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the **Income Statement**:\n- Total Revenue: \\$5,064,939.23\n- Gross Profit: \\$2,329,939.23\n\nFrom the **Cash Flow Statement**:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$64,099.10\n\nFrom the **Balance Sheet**:\n- Total Current Liabilities: \\$1,493,246.99\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,329,939.23}{5,064,939.23} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\\[\n\\frac{2,329,939.23}{5,064,939.23} \\approx 0.4600\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\\[\n0.4600 \\times 100 = 46.00\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is **46.00%**.\n\n### Calculating Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-64,099.10}{1,493,246.99}\n\\]\n\nPerforming the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{-64,099.10}{1,493,246.99} \\approx -0.0429\n\\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-0.04**.\n\n*Note*: A negative ratio indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative, meaning it's not generating enough cash from operations to cover its debts, which isn't a good sign.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit: \\$2,329,939.23\n   - Total Revenue: \\$5,064,939.23\n   - \\$2,329,939.23 / \\$5,064,939.23 ≈ 0.46 → 46%\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$64,099.10\n   - Total Current Liabilities: \\$1,493,246.99\n   - -\\$64,099.10 / \\$1,493,246.99 ≈ -0.0429\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '46.00%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.04'} }\n```\n\n### Additional Thoughts\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin (46.00%)**: This is quite high, indicating that the company retains a significant portion of revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This is generally positive, suggesting good control over production costs or strong pricing power.\n  \n- **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio (-0.04)**: The negative value is concerning. It means that the company's operating activities are not generating positive cash flow to cover its current liabilities. This could be due to high increases in accounts receivable or inventory, as seen in the cash flow statement where these items are increasing (hence the negative adjustments).\n\nIn summary, while the company is profitable at the gross level, its operational cash flow management needs improvement to ensure it can meet its short-term obligations.",
