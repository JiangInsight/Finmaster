                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand each component before plugging in the numbers.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -64,099.10\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n\n**Calculation:**  \n-64,099.10 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ -0.0429\n\nThis seems quite small. Maybe I should check if the operating cash flow is correctly identified. The \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" is indeed -64,099.10, so the calculation seems correct.\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities: Only current liabilities are given (1,493,246.99). There are no non-current liabilities listed, so total debt = current liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n- Total Owner's Equity = 13,707,199.17\n\n**Calculation:**  \n1,493,246.99 / 13,707,199.17 ≈ 0.109\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 5,064,939.23\n\nFor Average Total Assets:\n- Initial Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets = 15,200,446.16\n- Average = (13,000,000 + 15,200,446.16) / 2 = 14,100,223.08\n\n**Calculation:**  \n5,064,939.23 / 14,100,223.08 ≈ 0.359\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 9,717,259.46\n- Inventory = 450,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n\n**Calculation:**  \n(9,717,259.46 - 450,000) / 1,493,246.99 = 9,267,259.46 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.21\n\nWait, this seems too high. Let me check the components of current assets:\n- Cash on Hand: 4,540,900.90\n- Bank Deposits: 2,866,063.83\n- Interest Receivable: 8,967.44\n- Accounts Receivable: 1,851,327.29\n- Inventory: 450,000.00\nTotal: 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 + 8,967.44 + 1,851,327.29 + 450,000.00 = 9,717,259.46 (matches)\n\nQuick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 9,717,259.46 - 450,000 = 9,267,259.46\nQuick Ratio = 9,267,259.46 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.21\n\nHmm, the example had a quick ratio of 1.54, and this is much higher. Maybe the company has a lot of liquid assets compared to liabilities. It seems correct based on the numbers.\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nThis is the same as the first ratio we calculated:\n- Operating Cash Flow = -64,099.10\n- Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n- Ratio = -64,099.10 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ -0.0429\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Income / Average Shareholder's Equity\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = 707,199.17\n\nFor Average Equity:\n- Initial Equity = 13,000,000.00\n- End Equity = 13,707,199.17\n- Average = (13,000,000 + 13,707,199.17) / 2 = 13,353,599.585\n\n**Calculation:**  \n707,199.17 / 13,353,599.585 ≈ 0.053 or 5.3%\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since no info on cash sales):\n- Net Sales = 5,064,939.23\n\nFor Average Accounts Receivable:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00\n- End Accounts Receivable = 1,851,327.29\n- Average = (0 + 1,851,327.29) / 2 = 925,663.645\n\n**Calculation:**  \n5,064,939.23 / 925,663.645 ≈ 5.47\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.04', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.36', 'Quick Ratio': '6.21', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.04', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '5.30%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '5.47'} }\n```\n\n**Reviewing the Quick Ratio:**\nThe quick ratio seems unusually high at 6.21, which suggests the company has a lot of liquid assets compared to its current liabilities. Let me double-check the components:\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 4,540,900.90 + 2,866,063.83 + 8,967.44 + 1,851,327.29 = 9,267,259.46\n\nCurrent Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\n\nQuick Ratio = 9,267,259.46 / 1,493,246.99 ≈ 6.21\n\nThis seems correct based on the provided data. The company indeed has a large amount of cash and receivables relative to its current liabilities.\n\nSimilarly, the other ratios seem correctly calculated based on the given data. The negative operating cash flow ratios indicate that the company had negative cash flow from operations relative to its current liabilities, which could be a concern, but the quick ratio shows strong liquidity. The ROE is positive, indicating profitability for the shareholders. The accounts receivable turnover is healthy, suggesting efficient collection. The total asset turnover is moderate, indicating decent efficiency in using assets to generate sales. The debt to equity ratio is low, indicating minimal reliance on debt financing.",
