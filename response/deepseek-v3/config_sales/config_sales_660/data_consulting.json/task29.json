                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the four requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities here) = 1,493,246.99\n- Total Owner's Equity = 13,707,199.17\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 1,493,246.99 / 13,707,199.17 ≈ 0.1089\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:**  \nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 707,199.17\n- Total Revenue = 5,064,939.23\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (707,199.17 / 5,064,939.23) * 100 ≈ 13.96%\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:**  \nROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets = 15,200,446.16\n- Net Profit = 707,199.17\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (707,199.17 / 15,200,446.16) * 100 ≈ 4.65%\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since we don't have separate data for cash and credit sales), we'll use Total Revenue as Net Credit Sales.\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 5,064,939.23\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Accounts Receivable at the end = 1,851,327.29\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00 (since it's the first period, assuming no starting receivables)\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2 = (0 + 1,851,327.29) / 2 = 925,663.645\n\nCalculation:\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 5,064,939.23 / 925,663.645 ≈ 5.47\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Net Profit Margin': '13.96%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '4.65%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '5.47'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - 1,493,246.99 / 13,707,199.17 ≈ 0.1089 → Rounded to 0.11 ✔\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - 707,199.17 / 5,064,939.23 ≈ 0.1396 → 13.96% ✔\n\n3. **ROA:**\n   - 707,199.17 / 15,200,446.16 ≈ 0.0465 → 4.65% ✔\n\n4. **Accounts Receivable Turnover:**\n   - Average AR = (0 + 1,851,327.29)/2 = 925,663.645\n   - 5,064,939.23 / 925,663.645 ≈ 5.47 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The ratios are calculated correctly based on the provided financial data.",
