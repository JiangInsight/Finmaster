                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: Return on Equity (ROE), Debt to Asset Ratio, and Gross Profit Margin. \n\n### 1. Understanding the Ratios\n\n**Return on Equity (ROE):**\nThis measures how effectively a company is using its shareholders' equity to generate profit. The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Shareholders' Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n*Note:* Sometimes, especially for short periods or when initial equity is given, we might use ending equity if beginning equity isn't provided or if changes are minimal. Here, since we have both initial and end amounts, we can calculate average equity.\n\n**Debt to Asset Ratio:**\nThis shows the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\nA lower ratio means less reliance on debt for financing.\n\n**Gross Profit Margin:**\nThis indicates the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\nIt shows how efficiently a company produces and sells its products.\n\n### 2. Extracting Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n- **Total Assets (End):** 15,200,446.16\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End):** 1,493,246.99\n  - *Assuming no long-term liabilities, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities*\n- **Paid-in Capital (End):** 13,000,000.00\n- **Retained Earnings (End):** 707,199.17\n  - *Total Owner's Equity = Paid-in Capital + Retained Earnings = 13,000,000 + 707,199.17 = 13,707,199.17*\n  \nFrom the **income statement**:\n- **Net Profit:** 707,199.17\n- **Total Revenue:** 5,064,939.23\n- **Gross Profit:** 2,329,939.23\n\n### 3. Calculating ROE\n\nFirst, let's find the average shareholders' equity.\n- Initial Equity: 13,000,000.00 (from initial Paid-in Capital, Retained Earnings was 0)\n- Ending Equity: 13,707,199.17\n- Average Equity = (Initial + Ending) / 2 = (13,000,000 + 13,707,199.17) / 2 = 26,707,199.17 / 2 = 13,353,599.585\n\nNow, ROE:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{707,199.17}{13,353,599.585} \\times 100 \\approx 5.30\\% \\]\n\n*Alternatively, if we use ending equity directly (as sometimes done for simplicity):*\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{707,199.17}{13,707,199.17} \\times 100 \\approx 5.16\\% \\]\n*Given the example used ending equity, we'll follow that approach for consistency.*\n\n### 4. Calculating Debt to Asset Ratio\n\nTotal Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,493,246.99\nTotal Assets = 15,200,446.16\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{1,493,246.99}{15,200,446.16} \\approx 0.098 \\]\n*Rounded to two decimal places: 0.10*\n\n### 5. Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{2,329,939.23}{5,064,939.23} \\times 100 \\approx 46.00\\% \\]\n\n### 6. Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example:\n- ROE: Used ending equity (-1,645,141.43 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ -14.49%, but given as -13.51%, possibly due to averaging)\n- Debt to Asset: 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.14\n- Gross Profit Margin: 1,021,018.59 / 5,431,018.59 ≈ 18.80%\n\nOur calculations seem in line with the approach, though the example might have used slightly different methods (like averaging for ROE).\n\n### 7. Final Calculations\n\nGiven that, let's stick with ending equity for ROE for consistency with the example:\n\n- **ROE:** \n  \\[ \\frac{707,199.17}{13,707,199.17} \\times 100 \\approx 5.16\\% \\]\n  *Rounded to two decimal places: 5.16%*\n\n- **Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n  \\[ \\frac{1,493,246.99}{15,200,446.16} \\approx 0.098 \\]\n  *Rounded to two decimal places: 0.10*\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin:**\n  \\[ \\frac{2,329,939.23}{5,064,939.23} \\times 100 \\approx 46.00\\% \\]\n\nHowever, observing that the example's ROE was calculated possibly with average equity, let's compute that:\n\nAverage Equity = (13,000,000 + 13,707,199.17) / 2 = 13,353,599.585\nROE = 707,199.17 / 13,353,599.585 ≈ 5.30%\n\nGiven the example's slight discrepancy, it's likely they used ending equity, so we'll proceed with that.\n\n### 8. Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '5.16%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Gross Profit Margin': '46.00%'}}\n```\n\n*Note: If averaging equity is preferred for ROE, then ROE would be '5.30%'. Given the example's approach seems to use ending equity, '5.16%' is chosen here.*",
