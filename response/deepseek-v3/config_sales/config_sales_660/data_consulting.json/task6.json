                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Net Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Net Profit Margin\nFirst, I recall that the Net Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows what percentage of a company's revenue is actual profit after all expenses are deducted. It's calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nThis will give us the margin as a percentage.\n\n### Identifying the Necessary Values\nFrom the provided income statement, I need two key pieces of information:\n1. **Net Profit**: This is the bottom line after all expenses, including taxes, have been subtracted from the revenue.\n2. **Total Revenue**: This is the total income generated from the business's operations.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- **Net Profit**: It's given as 707,199.17 (last line of the table).\n- **Total Revenue**: It's given as 5,064,939.23 (second line of the table).\n\n### Calculating the Net Profit Margin\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{707,199.17}{5,064,939.23} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide the Net Profit by Total Revenue:\n\n\\[ \\frac{707,199.17}{5,064,939.23} \\approx 0.1396 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.1396 \\times 100 \\approx 13.96\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't make a mistake:\n- Net Profit: 707,199.17\n- Total Revenue: 5,064,939.23\n- Division: 707,199.17 / 5,064,939.23 ≈ 0.1396\n- Percentage: 0.1396 * 100 = 13.96%\n\nThis seems correct.\n\n### Considering the Example\nLooking back at the provided example:\n- Net Profit was -1,645,141.43\n- Total Revenue was 5,431,018.59\n- Calculation: (-1,645,141.43 / 5,431,018.59) * 100 ≈ -30.29%\nThis matches the given solution, so my approach seems aligned with the example.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter performing the calculation, the Net Profit Margin is approximately 13.96%.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '13.96%'} }\n```",
