These items are typically classified as \"Fixed Assets\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - From the given balance sheet, the line item that represents tangible assets held for use in production, rental, or administrative purposes is \"Fixed Assets\". This is because fixed assets include property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) which are used in operations.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Fixed Assets\" is provided as `5000000.00` on the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Fixed Assets\" is provided as `5528936.17` on the end date `2024-01-29`.\n\n4. **Verify Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is a contra-asset account that reduces the value of fixed assets. However, the net value of fixed assets is already reflected in \"Total Non-current Assets\" (`5483186.70`), which is calculated as `Fixed Assets - Accumulated Depreciation` (`5528936.17 - 45749.47`). \n   - Since the task asks for the value of tangible items (gross value before depreciation), we should use the \"Fixed Assets\" line item directly, not the net value after depreciation.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5528936.17'} }\n```",
