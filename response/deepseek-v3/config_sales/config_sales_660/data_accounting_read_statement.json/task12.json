These are typically the current assets.\n\nFrom the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of all assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within one year or the operating cycle, whichever is longer. \n\nHere are the steps to identify the required values:\n\n1. **Identify the line item for total current assets**: In the given balance sheet, this is \"Total Current Assets\".\n2. **Extract the initial value**: The initial amount for \"Total Current Assets\" is \"8000000.00\" as of the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n3. **Extract the end value**: The end amount for \"Total Current Assets\" is \"9717259.46\" as of the end date \"2024-01-29\".\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '9717259.46'} }\n```",
