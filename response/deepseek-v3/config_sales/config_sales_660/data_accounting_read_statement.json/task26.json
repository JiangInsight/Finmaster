In an income statement, these are usually listed under \"Financial Expenses\" or similar terms.\n2. **Reviewing the Income Statement**: Looking at the provided income statement, we can see a line item labeled \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of \"226258.90\".\n3. **Verification**: This line item is the most relevant as it directly represents the costs incurred for raising funds (e.g., interest on loans or other financing activities).\n4. **Exclusion of Other Items**: Other expenses like \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Selling Expenses\", and \"Depreciation\" are not related to financing costs, so they can be ignored for this task.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of financing costs is \"226258.90\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '226258.90'} }\n```",
