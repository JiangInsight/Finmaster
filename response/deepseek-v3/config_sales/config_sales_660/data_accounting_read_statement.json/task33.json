In the given problem, this is \"Main Business Revenue\" with the value \"5064939.23\".\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is typically the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" or similar line item that represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company. In the given problem, this is \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with the value \"2735000.00\".\n\nThe order of these values in the output should match the order in which they appear in the income statement. \n\nHere is the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5064939.23', 'value2': '2735000.00'} }\n```",
