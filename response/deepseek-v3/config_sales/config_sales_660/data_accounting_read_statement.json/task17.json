In the given balance sheet, the line item is \"Accounts Receivable\".\n   - Initial value: '0.00' (from Initial_amount column)\n   - End value: '1851327.29' (from End_amount column)\n\n2. **Identify Accounts Payable**: This line item represents amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit. In the given balance sheet, the line item is \"Accounts Payable\".\n   - Initial value: '0.00' (from Initial_amount column)\n   - End value: '1240000.00' (from End_amount column)\n\n3. **Order of Line Items**: The order of the line items in the solution should match the order in which they appear in the input statement. In the input, \"Accounts Receivable\" appears before \"Accounts Payable\", so the values should be listed in that order.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '0.00', 'end valu1': '1851327.29', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '1240000.00'} }\n```",
