I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the correct answers.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe have three financial statements provided:\n1. **Balance Sheet**\n2. **Cash Flow Statement**\n3. **Income Statement**\n\nOur goal is to:\n- Identify and extract two specific line items:\n  1. The end value of funds deposited into a bank.\n  2. The income earned by an entity from financial assets.\n- Group these by the financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement.\n- Within each group, maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement.\n\nFrom the example given, it seems:\n- `value1` corresponds to the \"Bank Deposits\" from the Balance Sheet (end_amount).\n- `value2` corresponds to the \"Interest Income\" from the Income Statement (amount).\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nLet's look at the current problem's financial statements to find these values.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet table, we're interested in \"Bank Deposits\". Here's the relevant line:\n\n| Account | Initial_amount | Initial_date | End_amount | End_date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bank Deposits | 5000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 2866063.83 | 2024-01-29 |\n\nSo, the end value of funds deposited into a bank is `2866063.83`.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nNow, we look for income earned from financial assets. Typically, this would be interest income or similar. Here's the Income Statement table:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Interest Income | 8967.44 | 2024-01-29 |\n\nThis seems to be the income earned from financial assets (likely interest on deposits or investments).\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nThe example didn't use the Cash Flow Statement for these values, and in the current problem, scanning the Cash Flow Statement doesn't seem to provide additional relevant line items for `value1` or `value2`. So, we might not need to extract anything from here for this task.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the example:\n\n- `value1`: '164645.57' (Bank Deposits' end_amount from Balance Sheet)\n- `value2`: '2672.87' (Interest Income from Income Statement)\n\nThis matches our understanding.\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nFor the current problem:\n- `value1`: '2866063.83' (Bank Deposits' end_amount from Balance Sheet)\n- `value2`: '8967.44' (Interest Income from Income Statement)\n\n### Potential Confusions\n\nInitially, I wondered if \"Interest Receivable\" from the Balance Sheet could be relevant, but it seems that's more of an asset representing accrued interest not yet received, whereas \"Interest Income\" is the actual income earned during the period. The example also used \"Interest Income\" from the Income Statement, not \"Interest Receivable\".\n\nAlso, the Cash Flow Statement has \"Interest Receivable\" changes, but that's about changes in the receivable, not the income earned.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2866063.83', 'value2': '8967.44'}}\n```",
