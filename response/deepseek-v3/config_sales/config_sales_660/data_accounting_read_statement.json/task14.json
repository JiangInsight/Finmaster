These are typically referred to as \"Current Liabilities\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Liabilities**: \n   - Current liabilities are obligations that are expected to be settled within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually within one year). \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Current Liabilities\" are:\n     - Accounts Payable\n     - Taxes Payable\n     - Total Current Liabilities\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Total Current Liabilities\" line item provides the aggregate value of all current liabilities at the initial and end dates.\n   - From the table:\n     - **Initial_amount**: The initial value of \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `0.00` as of `2023-12-31`.\n     - **End_amount**: The end value of \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `1493246.99` as of `2024-01-29`.\n\n3. **Verify Line Items**:\n   - The individual current liabilities (Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable) sum up to the \"Total Current Liabilities\":\n     - Accounts Payable: `1240000.00`\n     - Taxes Payable: `253246.99`\n     - Total: `1240000.00 + 253246.99 = 1493246.99` (matches the \"Total Current Liabilities\" value).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1493246.99'} }\n```",
