                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we need.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific values from the financial statements:\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares** (from the Balance Sheet).\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense** (from the Income Statement).\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period** (from the Cash Flow Statement).\n\nThe order is important: Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement, then Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet - Capital Contributed by Shareholders\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, we're interested in the capital that shareholders have contributed in exchange for shares. This is typically listed as \"Paid-in Capital\" or \"Share Capital.\"\n\nFrom the given Balance Sheet:\n```\nPaid-in Capital | 13000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 13000000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n```\nThe \"End_amount\" is `13000000.00`, which hasn't changed from the initial amount, indicating no new capital was added during this period. However, since the initial and end amounts are the same, it might imply that the capital was `13000000.00` at the end, which is what we're interested in.\n\nSo, **value1 = '13000000.00'**.\n\n### 2. Income Statement - Profit Before Tax\nNext, from the Income Statement, we need the profit or loss before tax expense. This is usually labeled as \"Profit Before Tax\" or \"Income Before Tax.\"\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n```\nProfit Before Tax | 960446.16 | 2024-01-29 |\n```\nThis is the profit before any tax is deducted. \n\nSo, **value2 = '960446.16'**.\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement - Increase in Accounts Payable\nNow, from the Cash Flow Statement, we need the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period. This is typically the increase in \"Accounts Payable.\"\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n```\nIncrease (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 1240000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n```\nThis line shows that Accounts Payable increased by `1240000.00` during the period, which means the entity owes this much more for goods/services purchased on credit.\n\nSo, **value3 = '1240000.00'**.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nLooking back at the provided example to ensure we're on the right track:\n- `value1` was '13000000.00' (Paid-in Capital from Balance Sheet).\n- `value2` was '-1373590.51' (Profit Before Tax from Income Statement).\n- `value3` was '1590000.00' (Increase in Accounts Payable from Cash Flow).\n\nOur approach matches the example, so we're good.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '960446.16', 'value3': '1240000.00'}}\n```",
