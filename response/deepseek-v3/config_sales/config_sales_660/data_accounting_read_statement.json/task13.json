These are typically the non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets and accumulated depreciation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Criteria**: \n   - Non-current assets are assets that are not expected to be converted into cash or used up within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually one year). Examples include fixed assets (like property, plant, and equipment) and intangible assets.\n   - In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Total Non-current Assets\" fit this criteria.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Line Items**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, the relevant line items are:\n     - Fixed Assets\n     - Accumulated Depreciation\n     - Total Non-current Assets\n\n3. **Extract the Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Total Non-current Assets\" line item provides the aggregated value of non-current assets at the initial and end dates.\n   - From the table:\n     - Initial value of Total Non-current Assets: 5000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End value of Total Non-current Assets: 5483186.70 (as of 2024-01-29)\n\n4. **Verify the Calculation**:\n   - The initial value of Fixed Assets is 5000000.00, and Accumulated Depreciation is 0.00, so Total Non-current Assets is 5000000.00 - 0.00 = 5000000.00.\n   - The end value of Fixed Assets is 5528936.17, and Accumulated Depreciation is 45749.47, so Total Non-current Assets is 5528936.17 - 45749.47 = 5483186.70. This matches the given value.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The initial and end values of non-current assets are 5000000.00 and 5483186.70, respectively.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5483186.70'}}\n```",
