In the balance sheet, expenses are often reflected indirectly through changes in certain accounts like \"Accumulated Depreciation\" or \"Retained Earnings.\"\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Accounts**:\n   - **Accumulated Depreciation**: This account represents the total depreciation expense accumulated over time. The change in this account between the initial and end dates reflects the depreciation expense for the period.\n   - **Retained Earnings**: This account reflects the net income or loss over time. However, it is a cumulative account and not a direct expense item.\n\n3. **Extract Values**:\n   - From the given balance sheet, the \"Accumulated Depreciation\" account has:\n     - Initial value: `0.00` (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End value: `45749.47` (as of 2024-01-29)\n   - This indicates that the depreciation expense for the period is the difference between the end value and the initial value, which is `45749.47 - 0.00 = 45749.47`.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The expense item to extract is \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" with the initial and end values as given in the balance sheet.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '45749.47'} }\n```",
