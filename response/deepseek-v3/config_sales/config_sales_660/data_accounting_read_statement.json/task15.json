Specifically, we are interested in the **Total Owner's Equity** line item, which gives us the total equity at the initial and end dates.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Initial Value of Total Owner's Equity**: \n   - The initial amount is given as `13000000.00` on the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n\n2. **End Value of Total Owner's Equity**: \n   - The end amount is given as `13707199.17` on the end date `2024-01-29`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13707199.17'} }\n```",
