                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through the cash flow statement provided and identify the three specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific pieces of information from the cash flow statement:\n\n1. **The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This typically refers to the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" because accounts payable represent amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit.\n   \n2. **Acquisition of property, plant, and equipment**: This is usually listed as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement.\n   \n3. **Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period**: This is the \"Beginning Balance\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Cash Flow Statement\nLet's look at the given cash flow statement and find these items.\n\n#### 1. Increase in Accounts Payable\nLooking at the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, we see:\n- \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with an amount of `1240000.00`. This is the increase in the amount owed for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\n#### 2. Purchase of Fixed Assets\nIn the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section:\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is listed with an amount of `528936.17`. This represents the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment.\n\n#### 3. Cash and Cash Equivalents at Beginning of Period\nUnder the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section:\n- \"Beginning Balance\" is `8000000.00`. This is the cash and cash equivalents at the start of the period.\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe problem mentions that for multiple outputs, we should maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement. Looking at the statement:\n\n1. \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" appears first among our three items.\n2. \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" comes next in the investing section.\n3. \"Beginning Balance\" is last in the cash equivalents section.\n\nSo, the order is correct as per the statement's sequence.\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, compiling these into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1240000.00', 'value2': '528936.17', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```\n\n### Summary\n- **value1**: '1240000.00' (Increase in Accounts Payable)\n- **value2**: '528936.17' (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n- **value3**: '8000000.00' (Beginning Cash Balance)\n\nThis matches the example provided where similar line items were extracted in the same order.",
