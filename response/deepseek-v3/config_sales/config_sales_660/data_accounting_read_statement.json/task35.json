I'm going to go through the income statement provided and identify the four specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract four specific line items from the income statement:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**: This typically refers to \"Selling Expenses\" because these are costs associated with selling products or services, like advertising, sales commissions, and delivery costs.\n   \n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually labeled as \"Financial Expenses\" or \"Interest Expense,\" which are costs related to borrowing money.\n\n3. **The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is \"Depreciation,\" which is the allocation of the cost of tangible assets over their useful lives.\n\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period**: This is \"Tax Expense,\" representing the taxes owed for the period.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Income Statement\nHere's the income statement we're working with:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 5064939.23 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Total Revenue | 5064939.23 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 2735000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Total Cost | 2735000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Gross Profit | 2329939.23 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 250651.94 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Selling Expenses | 855800.20 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Depreciation | 45749.47 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Financial Expenses | 226258.90 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Total Expenses | 1378460.51 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Interest Income | 8967.44 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 960446.16 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Tax Expense | 253246.99 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Profit | 707199.17 | 2024-01-29 |\n\n### Identifying the Four Line Items\n\n1. **Selling Expenses**: This directly matches the first item we're looking for—costs to secure orders and deliver goods/services.  \n   - **Value**: 855800.20\n\n2. **Depreciation**: This is the systematic allocation of an asset's cost over its useful life.  \n   - **Value**: 45749.47\n\n3. **Financial Expenses**: These are the financing costs to raise funds.  \n   - **Value**: 226258.90\n\n4. **Tax Expense**: This is the total taxes expected to be paid or recovered.  \n   - **Value**: 253246.99\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nLooking at the provided example:\n\n- Selling Expenses: 493854.67 → value1\n- Depreciation: 45751.41 → value2\n- Financial Expenses: 432511.69 → value3\n- Tax Expense: 271550.92 → value4\n\nThis confirms our mapping is correct.\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, plugging in the values we've identified into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '855800.20', 'value2': '45749.47', 'value3': '226258.90', 'value4': '253246.99'} }\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. **Selling Expenses (value1)**: Found as \"Selling Expenses\" with amount 855800.20.\n2. **Depreciation (value2)**: Found as \"Depreciation\" with amount 45749.47.\n3. **Financial Expenses (value3)**: Found as \"Financial Expenses\" with amount 226258.90.\n4. **Tax Expense (value4)**: Found as \"Tax Expense\" with amount 253246.99.\n\nAll values are correctly identified and ordered as per the instructions.",
