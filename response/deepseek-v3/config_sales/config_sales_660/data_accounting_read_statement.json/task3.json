This is typically labeled as \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are looking for the line item that shows money owed to the company by customers for goods or services sold on credit. This is \"Accounts Receivable\" in accounting terms.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided balance sheet, we can see the \"Accounts Receivable\" line item under the \"Account\" column.\n\n3. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Accounts Receivable\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - **End Value**: The \"End_amount\" for \"Accounts Receivable\" is `1851327.29` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-01-29`.\n\n4. **Verify**: Ensure that \"Accounts Receivable\" is indeed the correct line item for amounts owed for goods or services sold on credit. This is confirmed by standard accounting practices.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1851327.29'} }\n```",
