                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement extraction task step by step. I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we're interested in.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific values from the financial statements:\n1. **Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit**: This typically refers to \"Accounts Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet.\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually \"Financial Expenses\" in the Income Statement.\n3. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is often \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThe order to present these is:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet - Accounts Receivable\nLooking at the Balance Sheet provided, we have the following line:\n\n| Account | Initial_amount | Initial_date | End_amount | End_date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Accounts Receivable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 1851327.29 | 2024-01-29 |\n\nThe \"End_amount\" for \"Accounts Receivable\" is **1851327.29**. This is the amount owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit at the end of the period.\n\n### 2. Income Statement - Financial Expenses\nNow, let's look at the Income Statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Financial Expenses | 226258.90 | 2024-01-29 |\n\nHere, \"Financial Expenses\" are listed as **226258.90**. This represents the financing costs incurred by the enterprise.\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement - Purchase of Fixed Assets\nFinally, examining the Cash Flow Statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 528936.17 | 2024-01-29 |\n\nThe \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is **528936.17**, which indicates the cash payments made to acquire long-term assets.\n\n### Verifying the Order\nJust to ensure we're following the correct order:\n1. Balance Sheet (Accounts Receivable)\n2. Income Statement (Financial Expenses)\n3. Cash Flow Statement (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n\nThis matches the required sequence.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1851327.29', 'value2': '226258.90', 'value3': '528936.17'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. **Accounts Receivable (Balance Sheet)**: Located in the Balance Sheet under \"Accounts Receivable\" with an end amount of 1851327.29.\n2. **Financial Expenses (Income Statement)**: Found in the Income Statement as \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of 226258.90.\n3. **Purchase of Fixed Assets (Cash Flow Statement)**: Identified in the Cash Flow Statement as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an amount of 528936.17.\n\nAll values are correctly identified and ordered as per the instructions.",
