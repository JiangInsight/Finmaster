This line item is typically labeled as \"Depreciation\" in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Locate the Operating Activities Section**: The cash flow statement is divided into operating, investing, and financing activities. Depreciation is listed under the operating activities section.\n2. **Identify the Depreciation Line Item**: Look for the line item labeled \"Depreciation\" in the operating activities section.\n3. **Extract the Value**: Once the \"Depreciation\" line item is found, note the corresponding amount.\n\n### Applying to the Given Problem:\n- In the provided cash flow statement, under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\", there is a line item labeled \"Depreciation\" with the amount \"45749.47\" dated \"2024-01-29\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45749.47'} }\n```",
