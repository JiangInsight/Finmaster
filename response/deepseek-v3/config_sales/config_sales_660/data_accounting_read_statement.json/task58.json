These items are usually listed under current assets in the balance sheet.\n\n2. **Locating the Initial Amounts**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, we can see the following line items under current assets:\n     - \"Cash on Hand\" with an initial amount of `3000000.00` as of `2023-12-31`.\n     - \"Bank Deposits\" with an initial amount of `5000000.00` as of `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Calculating Total Cash and Cash Equivalents at the Beginning of the Period**:\n   - The total cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period is the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\":\n     - `3000000.00 (Cash on Hand) + 5000000.00 (Bank Deposits) = 8000000.00`.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - The \"Beginning Balance\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section in the cash flow statement is also `8000000.00`, which matches our calculation. This confirms that the total cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period is indeed `8000000.00`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
