This is typically represented by the \"Retained Earnings\" account in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item we are interested in is \"Retained Earnings\" because it represents the cumulative amount of profits or losses that have been retained in the entity and not distributed to shareholders.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - From the given balance sheet, the \"Retained Earnings\" account has an \"Initial_amount\" of `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The \"Retained Earnings\" account has an \"End_amount\" of `707199.17` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-01-29`.\n\n4. **Verify the Data**:\n   - The initial value of retained earnings is `0.00`, which means there were no retained earnings at the beginning of the period.\n   - The end value of retained earnings is `707199.17`, which indicates a profit retained during the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '707199.17'} }\n```",
