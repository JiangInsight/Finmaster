This represents the interest accrued but not yet received.\n\n### Step 2: Identify \"Net Increase\" in Cash and Cash Equivalents in the Cash Flow Statement\n- In the Cash Flow Statement, under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, there is a line item called \"Net Increase\" with an \"Amount\" of `-593035.27`. This represents the net addition (or reduction) in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\n### Step 3: Prepare the Solution\n- The first value (`value1`) is the \"Interest Receivable\" from the Balance Sheet: `8967.44`.\n- The second value (`value2`) is the \"Net Increase\" from the Cash Flow Statement: `-593035.27`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '8967.44', 'value2': '-593035.27'}}\n```",
