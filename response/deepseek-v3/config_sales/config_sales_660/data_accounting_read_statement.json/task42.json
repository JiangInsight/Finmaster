This is typically found under the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section of the cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Section**: In the provided cash flow statement, the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section includes the line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which is the standard label for cash payments to acquire PP&E and other long-term assets.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is `528936.17`.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is `-528936.17`, which matches the negative of the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" value, confirming that this is the only investing activity in this statement.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '528936.17'}}\n```",
