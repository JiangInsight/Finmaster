These are typically referred to as \"Current Liabilities\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Liabilities**: \n   - Current liabilities are obligations that are expected to be settled within the entity's normal operating cycle, usually within one year. In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Current Liabilities\" are \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\". The total of these items is given as \"Total Current Liabilities\".\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Total Current Liabilities\" is provided as \"0.00\" on the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Total Current Liabilities\" is provided as \"829755.77\" on the end date \"2024-01-28\".\n\n4. **Verify**:\n   - The sum of \"Accounts Payable\" (545000.00) and \"Taxes Payable\" (284755.77) is indeed 829755.77, which matches the \"Total Current Liabilities\" end value.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '829755.77'} }\n```",
