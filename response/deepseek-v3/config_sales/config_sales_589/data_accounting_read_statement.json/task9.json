This information is typically found under \"Taxes Payable\" in the liabilities section of the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item \"Taxes Payable\" represents the tax that has been accrued but not yet paid. This is the amount of tax the company owes but has not yet settled.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value is the amount under \"Initial_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\". In the given balance sheet, the initial value is \"0.00\" as of the \"Initial_date\" \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value is the amount under \"End_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\". In the given balance sheet, the end value is \"284755.77\" as of the \"End_date\" \"2024-01-28\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '284755.77'} }\n```",
