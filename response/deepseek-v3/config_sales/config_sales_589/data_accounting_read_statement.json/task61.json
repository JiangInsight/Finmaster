The two line items are:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**: This typically refers to \"Selling Expenses\" in the income statement, as these expenses are related to marketing, sales, and distribution activities aimed at securing and fulfilling customer orders.\n\n2. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is usually found in the cash flow statement under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" or similar headings, representing cash outflows for acquiring long-term assets.\n\nThe financial statements provided are grouped in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement. We need to look for the relevant line items in this order, maintaining the original line item order within each statement.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Financial Statements\n\nLet's go through each financial statement to locate the required line items.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\nThe balance sheet provides a snapshot of the company's assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time. The line items we're looking for are related to costs and cash payments, which are more likely to appear in the income statement and cash flow statement, respectively. Therefore, we can skip the balance sheet for this task.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\nThe income statement shows the company's revenues, expenses, and profits over a period. Here, we're interested in \"costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers,\" which is likely to be under \"Selling Expenses.\"\n\nLooking at the income statement provided:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Selling Expenses | 555218.93 | 2024-01-28 |\n\nThis matches our first required line item. So, `value1` should be `555218.93`.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nThe cash flow statement shows the cash inflows and outflows from operating, investing, and financing activities. We're interested in \"cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets,\" which would be under investing activities, specifically \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement provided:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets | 106218.20 | 2024-01-28 |\n\nThis matches our second required line item. So, `value2` should be `106218.20`.\n\n### Verifying the Line Items\n\n- **Selling Expenses (555218.93)**: This is a standard category in the income statement that includes costs related to selling products or services, such as advertising, sales commissions, and delivery costs. It aligns perfectly with \"costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers.\"\n\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets (106218.20)**: This line item in the cash flow statement represents cash spent on acquiring long-term assets like property, plant, and equipment, which matches the second requirement.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully reviewing each financial statement and identifying the relevant line items, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '555218.93', 'value2': '106218.20'}}\n```",
