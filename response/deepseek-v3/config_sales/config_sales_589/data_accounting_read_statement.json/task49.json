This is the first value we need (`value1`).\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: The line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" has an amount of `106218.20`. This is the second value we need (`value2`).\n\n3. **Beginning Balance**: The line item \"Beginning Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" has an amount of `8000000.00`. This is the third value we need (`value3`).\n\nNow, we can compile these values into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '545000.00', 'value2': '106218.20', 'value3': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
