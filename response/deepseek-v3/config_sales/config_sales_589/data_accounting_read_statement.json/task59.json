Within each group, we should maintain the original line item order as shown in the input.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Financial Statements\n\nLet's go through each financial statement to locate the required information.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, we're interested in \"Interest Receivable\" which represents interest accrued but not yet received.\n\n- **Interest Receivable**:\n  - Initial_amount: 0.00\n  - End_amount: 10811.11\n  - The \"End_amount\" is the value we're interested in, which is **10811.11**.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nThe Income Statement shows \"Interest Income\" which is the interest earned during the period, but this is not the same as interest accrued but not yet received (which is in the Balance Sheet). So, we don't need to extract anything from here for our current task.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nIn the Cash Flow Statement, we're looking for the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\n- Under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\":\n  - Net Increase: -330351.42\n  - This is the value we're interested in, which is **-330351.42**.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the example provided:\n\n- \"Interest Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet had an End_amount of 2672.87, which was the first value extracted.\n- \"Net Increase\" in the Cash Flow Statement was -7565348.53, which was the second value extracted.\n\nThis confirms our approach is correct.\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nFrom the problem to solve:\n\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received (Interest Receivable - End_amount)**: 10811.11\n2. **Net addition in cash and cash equivalents (Net Increase)**: -330351.42\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '10811.11', 'value2': '-330351.42'} }\n```",
