                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break down the task to understand what each of the four values we need to extract represents, and then locate them in the given cash flow statement.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task asks us to identify and extract four specific line items from the cash flow statement based on their descriptions. Here's what each value corresponds to:\n\n1. **Value1**: The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.\n   - This is **Depreciation**. It's the amount by which an asset's value is reduced over time due to wear and tear.\n\n2. **Value2**: Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period.\n   - This refers to the change in **Inventory**. Since it's a reduction, we're looking at the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" line item. If the inventory increases, it's a negative cash flow (since cash is tied up in inventory), and if it decreases, it's positive.\n\n3. **Value3**: Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends.\n   - This is the **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**. It includes purchases and sales of fixed assets and other investments.\n\n4. **Value4**: Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n   - This is the **Net Increase** in cash and cash equivalents, which shows the overall change in cash position during the period.\n\n### Locating the Values in the Given Statement\n\nNow, let's go through the provided cash flow statement to find these values.\n\n**Given Cash Flow Statement:**\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Profit  | 1193771.08 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Depreciation  | 45749.30 | 2024-01-28 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -1562598.26 | 2024-01-28 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -10811.11 | 2024-01-28 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -720000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 545000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 284755.77 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -224133.22 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-01-28 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 106218.20 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -106218.20 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-01-28 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Ending Balance  | 7669648.58 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Increase  | -330351.42 | 2024-01-28 |\n\n**Extracting the Values:**\n\n1. **Value1 (Depreciation)**:\n   - Line item: \"Depreciation\"\n   - Amount: `45749.30`\n\n2. **Value2 (Change in Inventory)**:\n   - Line item: \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\"\n   - Amount: `-720000.00` (This is the reduction; negative indicates an increase in inventory, meaning cash outflow)\n\n3. **Value3 (Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities)**:\n   - Line item: \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\"\n   - Amount: `-106218.20`\n\n4. **Value4 (Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents)**:\n   - Line item: \"Net Increase\"\n   - Amount: `-330351.42`\n\n### Verifying the Values\n\nLet's double-check to ensure we've matched each description correctly:\n\n- **Depreciation**: Clearly matches \"Depreciation\" line.\n- **Change in Inventory**: \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" is the correct line; the negative value indicates an increase in inventory (cash used), which aligns with the description focusing on reduction (if it were positive, it would mean inventory decreased).\n- **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: Directly matches the line item.\n- **Net Increase in Cash**: Directly matches the \"Net Increase\" line; the negative value means cash decreased overall during the period.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully extracting and verifying each value, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '45749.30', 'value2': '-720000.00', 'value3': '-106218.20', 'value4': '-330351.42'}}\n```",
