In the income statement provided, this is represented by \"Total Revenue\" with a value of `5695115.02`.\n2. **Constituent Line Item**: The only constituent line item under \"Total Revenue\" is \"Main Business Revenue,\" which also has the same value (`5695115.02`). This indicates that the total revenue is entirely composed of the main business revenue.\n3. **Sub-Item Decomposition**: Since the task asks to decompose the total income into 1 component sub-item, we use \"Main Business Revenue\" as the sub-item. Its initial and final values are the same (`5695115.02`), as there are no other components or adjustments.\n\nThus, the solution is structured to reflect the total income (\"Total Revenue\") and its sole sub-item (\"Main Business Revenue\").",
