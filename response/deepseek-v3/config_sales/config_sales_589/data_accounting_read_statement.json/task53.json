This represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate the Income Statement**: The income statement contains the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" which directly represents the carrying amount of inventories sold.\n2. **Extract the Value**: In the income statement, the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is listed as `3085000.00`.\n\nThus, the value to be extracted is `3085000.00`.\n\nThe final answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3085000.00'} }\n```",
