This is typically reflected in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section as \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task is to find the line item that shows the change in accounts receivable, which indicates the decrease (or increase) in amounts owed to the entity for credit sales or services.\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is present under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with this line item is \"-1562598.26\". A negative value indicates an increase in accounts receivable (i.e., amounts owed to the entity have increased), but the task asks for the \"decrease\" in amounts owed. Since the value is negative, it actually represents an increase, not a decrease. However, the task is to extract the value as it appears in the statement, regardless of its sign.\n4. **Final Answer**: The value to be extracted is \"-1562598.26\".\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1562598.26'}}\n```",
