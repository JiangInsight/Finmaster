This information is typically found under the \"Paid-in Capital\" line item in the Owner's Equity section of the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item \"Paid-in Capital\" represents the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares. This is the amount we are interested in.\n\n2. **Locate Initial and End Values**:\n   - From the given balance sheet, the \"Paid-in Capital\" line item shows:\n     - **Initial_amount**: 13000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - **End_amount**: 13000000.00 (as of 2024-01-28)\n\n3. **Verify Consistency**:\n   - The initial and end values for \"Paid-in Capital\" are the same, indicating no additional capital was contributed during the period.\n\n4. **Extract the Values**:\n   - The initial value is '13000000.00'.\n   - The end value is '13000000.00'.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
