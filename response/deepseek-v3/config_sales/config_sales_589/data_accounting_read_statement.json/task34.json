                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to look at the income statement provided and identify the three specific line items we need to extract:\n\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**: This typically refers to the revenue generated from the main operations of the business. In the given income statement, the closest match is \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue\". Since \"Main Business Revenue\" is more specific to ordinary activities, I'll go with that.\n\n   - **Main Business Revenue**: 5,695,115.02\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is essentially the cost associated with the goods that were sold. In an income statement, this is usually labeled as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold**: 3,085,000.00\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**: These are the expenses related to running the business's administrative functions. In the income statement, this is labeled as \"Administrative Expenses\".\n\n   - **Administrative Expenses**: 399,315.81\n\nNow, let's verify these with the example provided to ensure we're on the right track.\n\nIn the example:\n- 'value1' was \"Main Business Revenue\": 5,431,018.59\n- 'value2' was \"Cost of Goods Sold\": 4,410,000.00\n- 'value3' was \"Administrative Expenses\": 1,425,164.20\n\nThis matches our understanding, so we can proceed confidently.\n\nNow, plugging in the values from the problem to solve:\n\n- 'value1': \"Main Business Revenue\" → 5,695,115.02\n- 'value2': \"Cost of Goods Sold\" → 3,085,000.00\n- 'value3': \"Administrative Expenses\" → 399,315.81\n\nFinally, presenting the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5695115.02', 'value2': '3085000.00', 'value3': '399315.81'} }\n```",
