This line item is typically labeled as \"Depreciation\" in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task is to extract the value associated with the depreciation line item from the cash flow statement. Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.\n\n2. **Locate the Depreciation Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, look for the line item labeled \"Depreciation\" under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: Once the \"Depreciation\" line item is found, note the corresponding amount and date.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: Ensure that the extracted value is indeed under the correct section and matches the description of depreciation.\n\n### Application to the Given Problem:\n\n- In the provided cash flow statement, the \"Depreciation\" line item is present under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" with an amount of `45749.30` and a date of `2024-01-28`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45749.30'} }\n```",
