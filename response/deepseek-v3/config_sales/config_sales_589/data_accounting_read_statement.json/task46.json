The net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from investing activities. This includes:\n   - Acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents.\n   - Receipt of interest and dividends.\n\n2. Decompose this item into 1 component sub-item, which must also come from the cash flow statement.\n3. Provide the final value of the main item and its sub-item.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Cash Flow Statement\n\nLet's look at the provided cash flow statement:\n\n```\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Profit  | 1193771.08 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Depreciation  | 45749.30 | 2024-01-28 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -1562598.26 | 2024-01-28 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -10811.11 | 2024-01-28 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -720000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 545000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 284755.77 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -224133.22 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-01-28 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 106218.20 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -106218.20 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-01-28 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Ending Balance  | 7669648.58 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Increase  | -330351.42 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\n\n### Identifying the Relevant Section\n\nThe section we're interested in is \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\" This section typically includes:\n\n- Purchase of fixed assets (capital expenditures)\n- Proceeds from sale of fixed assets\n- Purchase of investments\n- Proceeds from sale of investments\n- Receipt of interest and dividends\n\nIn the given statement, we see:\n\n1. \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an amount of 106,218.20 (this is an outflow, hence positive in the statement but negative in cash flow terms).\n2. \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with an amount of -106,218.20.\n\n### Determining the Main Value\n\nThe main value we're asked for is the net amount of cash and cash equivalents from investing activities. This is directly given as \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" which is -106,218.20.\n\n### Identifying the Sub-item\n\nWe need to decompose this into 1 sub-item. Looking at the investing activities, the only item listed is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\" \n\n- The \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is 106,218.20 (outflow).\n- The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is -106,218.20, which is essentially the negative of the purchase amount since it's the only item.\n\nThus, the sub-item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of 106,218.20.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example:\n\n- Main value: Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -305,354.43\n- Sub-item: Purchase of Fixed Assets = 305,354.43\n\nThis matches our understanding where the sub-item is the positive amount of the purchase, and the net is the negative of that (assuming it's the only item).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-106218.20\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value\": \"106218.20\"}}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate Investing Activities Section**: Found under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\"\n2. **Identify Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: Directly given as -106,218.20. This is our main value.\n3. **Find Sub-items**: Only one item under investing activities is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" at 106,218.20.\n4. **Confirm Relationship**: Net cash flow is the sum of all investing activities. Here, it's just the negative of the purchase amount.\n5. **Construct Output**: \n   - Main value: \"-106218.20\" (net cash flow from investing)\n   - Sub-item: \"106218.20\" (purchase of fixed assets)\n\nThus, the solution is correctly represented as above.",
