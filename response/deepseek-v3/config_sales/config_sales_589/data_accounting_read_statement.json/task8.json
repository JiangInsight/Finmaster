This typically refers to \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet, as it represents the amounts owed to suppliers or vendors for goods or services received on credit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item \"Accounts Payable\" is the one that represents the amounts owed for goods or services received on credit.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value and Date**:\n   - From the given balance sheet, the \"Accounts Payable\" line shows an \"Initial_amount\" of \"0.00\" and an \"Initial_date\" of \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value and Date**:\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Accounts Payable\" is \"545000.00\" and the \"End_date\" is \"2024-01-28\".\n\n4. **Verify the Context**:\n   - The task specifically asks for amounts owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit, which is exactly what \"Accounts Payable\" represents. No other line items in the balance sheet fit this description (e.g., \"Taxes Payable\" is for taxes owed, not for goods or services).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe initial value of \"Accounts Payable\" is \"0.00\", and the end value is \"545000.00\". \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '545000.00'} }\n```",
