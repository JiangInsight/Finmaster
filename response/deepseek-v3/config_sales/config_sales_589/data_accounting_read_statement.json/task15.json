Specifically, we are interested in the \"Total Owner's Equity\" line, which gives us the total equity at the initial and end dates.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Initial Value of Total Owner's Equity**: \n   - The initial value is given as '13000000.00' under the \"Total Owner's Equity\" line for the initial date '2023-12-31'.\n\n2. **End Value of Total Owner's Equity**: \n   - The end value is given as '14193771.08' under the \"Total Owner's Equity\" line for the end date '2024-01-28'.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '14193771.08'} }\n```",
