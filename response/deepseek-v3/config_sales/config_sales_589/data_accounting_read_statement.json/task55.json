This represents the tax liability at the end of the reporting period.\n\n3. **Check the Income Statement**:\n   - In the income statement, there is a line item \"Tax Expense\" with an \"Amount\" of `284755.77`. This represents the tax expense incurred during the reporting period.\n\n4. **Check the Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - In the cash flow statement, there is a line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an \"Amount\" of `284755.77`. This represents the change in tax payable during the reporting period.\n\n5. **Consistency Across Statements**:\n   - The value `284755.77` is consistent across all three statements, confirming that this is the correct amount of tax expected to be paid or recovered during the reporting period.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay or recover during the reporting period is `284755.77`.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '284755.77'} }\n```",
