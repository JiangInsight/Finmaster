These items are typically categorized under \"Fixed Assets\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The balance sheet includes a line item called \"Fixed Assets,\" which represents tangible assets used in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes. This is the item we are interested in.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Fixed Assets\" is given as `5000000.00` on the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Fixed Assets\" is given as `5106218.20` on the end date `2024-01-28`.\n\n4. **Verify Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is a separate line item that reduces the value of fixed assets over time. However, the task asks for the gross value of fixed assets (before depreciation), so we use the \"Fixed Assets\" line directly. If the task required net fixed assets, we would subtract the accumulated depreciation from the fixed assets.\n\n5. **Final Values**:\n   - Initial value: `5000000.00`\n   - End value: `5106218.20`\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5106218.20'}}\n```",
