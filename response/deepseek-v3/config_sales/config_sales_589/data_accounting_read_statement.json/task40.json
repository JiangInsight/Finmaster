This is typically reflected in the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" line item under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are looking for the increase in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit. This is captured by the \"Accounts Payable\" line item in the cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is present under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is \"545000.00\".\n\n4. **Verify the Sign**: The value is positive, indicating an increase in accounts payable, which aligns with the task description.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '545000.00'} }\n```",
