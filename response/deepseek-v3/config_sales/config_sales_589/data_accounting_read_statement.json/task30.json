This is the total amount of expenses incurred by the entity during the reporting period.\n\n2. **Identify the Four Component Sub-items:**\n   - The total expenses are typically composed of various sub-items listed in the income statement. From the given statement, the following four sub-items contribute to the total expenses:\n     - Administrative Expenses: \"399315.81\"\n     - Selling Expenses: \"555218.93\"\n     - Depreciation: \"45749.30\"\n     - Financial Expenses: \"142115.24\"\n\n3. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Sum of the sub-items:\n     - Administrative Expenses: 399315.81\n     - Selling Expenses: 555218.93\n     - Depreciation: 45749.30\n     - Financial Expenses: 142115.24\n     - Total = 399315.81 + 555218.93 + 45749.30 + 142115.24 = 1142399.28\n   - This matches the \"Total Expenses\" value, confirming that these are the correct sub-items.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"1142399.28\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value1\": \"399315.81\", \"sub_item value2\": \"555218.93\", \"sub_item value3\": \"45749.30\", \"sub_item value4\": \"142115.24\"}}}\n```",
