From the balance sheet provided, the relevant line items are \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" as these represent the cash available for daily operations.\n\n1. **Initial Value**: The initial amount of cash available is the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" at the initial date.\n   - Cash on Hand initial amount: 3000000.00\n   - Bank Deposits initial amount: 5000000.00\n   - Total initial cash: 3000000.00 + 5000000.00 = 8000000.00\n\n2. **End Value**: The end amount of cash available is the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" at the end date.\n   - Cash on Hand end amount: 3730866.78\n   - Bank Deposits end amount: 3938781.80\n   - Total end cash: 3730866.78 + 3938781.80 = 7669648.58\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the solution only included the \"Cash on Hand\" values and not the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\". Following the example's approach, we should only consider the \"Cash on Hand\" line item.\n\nTherefore:\n- Initial value: 3000000.00\n- End value: 3730866.78\n\nThe solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '3000000.00', 'end value': '3730866.78'} }\n```",
