COGS reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, including the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the goods.\n   \n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the given income statement, the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is present with an amount of \"3085000.00\" and a date of \"2024-01-28\".\n\n3. **Verify the Line Item**: The \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is indeed the correct line item that represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period. There are no other line items that would better fit this description (e.g., \"Inventory\" is a balance sheet item, not an income statement item).\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is \"3085000.00\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3085000.00'}}\n```",
