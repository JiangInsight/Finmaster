In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Net Profit.\"\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This represents cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets. In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nFrom the given problem, we can locate these two line items in the table:\n\n- **Net Profit**: The value is `1193771.08`.\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: The value is `106218.20`.\n\nThese values are found under the \"Amount\" column for the respective line items. \n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1193771.08', 'value2': '106218.20'} }\n```",
