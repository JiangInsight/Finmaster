This is typically listed under the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section of the cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Section**: In the provided cash flow statement, the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section contains the line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which represents cash payments for acquiring PP&E and other long-term assets.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The amount associated with \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is the value we are looking for. In the given problem, this amount is `106218.20`.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is `-106218.20`, which matches the negative value of the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" (since purchasing assets is a cash outflow). This confirms that `106218.20` is the correct value to extract.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '106218.20'}}\n```",
