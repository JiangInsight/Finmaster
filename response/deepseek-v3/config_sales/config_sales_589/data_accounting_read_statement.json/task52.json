This represents the amount of money shareholders have invested in the company by purchasing shares.\n\n2. **Locate the Initial and Final Values**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, we can see the \"Paid-in Capital\" line item under the \"Owner's Equity\" section.\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Paid-in Capital\" is 13,000,000.00 as of the initial date (2023-12-31).\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Paid-in Capital\" is also 13,000,000.00 as of the end date (2024-01-28). This indicates that there was no change in the paid-in capital during this period.\n\n3. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The initial and final values are the same, which suggests that no additional capital was contributed by shareholders during this period, and no shares were repurchased or retired.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
