I'm going to break it down to understand how to find the net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period, and then identify its two component sub-items.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's look at the structure of the cash flow statement provided. It's divided into three main sections:\n\n1. **Cash Flow From Operating Activities**: This section shows how much cash is generated or used by the company's main business operations.\n2. **Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: This section shows cash used for or generated from investments like purchasing fixed assets.\n3. **Cash and Cash Equivalents**: This section shows the changes in cash and cash equivalents over the period.\n\nOur focus is on the **Cash and Cash Equivalents** section, specifically the \"Net Increase\" line, which represents the net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\n### Identifying the Net Addition\n\nFrom the given data:\n\n- **Beginning Balance**: 8,000,000.00\n- **Ending Balance**: 7,669,648.58\n- **Net Increase**: -330,351.42\n\nThe \"Net Increase\" is already provided as -330,351.42. This is the net addition (in this case, a decrease) in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\n### Decomposing the Net Increase\n\nThe net increase in cash and cash equivalents is calculated as:\n\n**Net Increase = Ending Balance - Beginning Balance**\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nNet Increase = 7,669,648.58 - 8,000,000.00 = -330,351.42\n\nThis confirms that the two sub-items that make up the net increase are:\n\n1. **Beginning Balance**: 8,000,000.00\n2. **Ending Balance**: 7,669,648.58\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example:\n\n- Net Increase was -7,565,348.53\n- Sub-items were:\n  - Beginning Balance: 8,000,000.00\n  - Ending Balance: 434,651.47\n\nCalculating: 434,651.47 - 8,000,000.00 = -7,565,348.53, which matches the net increase.\n\nThis confirms our approach is correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, applying this to our problem:\n\n- **value (Net Increase)**: -330,351.42\n- **sub_item value1 (Beginning Balance)**: 8,000,000.00\n- **sub_item value2 (Ending Balance)**: 7,669,648.58\n\nSo, the solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-330351.42\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value1\": \"8000000.00\", \"sub_item value2\": \"7669648.58\"}}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Locate the Net Increase**: Found under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" as \"-330351.42\".\n2. **Identify Sub-items**:\n   - Beginning Balance: 8,000,000.00\n   - Ending Balance: 7,669,648.58\n3. **Verify Calculation**:\n   - 7,669,648.58 - 8,000,000.00 = -330,351.42 (matches Net Increase)\n4. **Format the Answer**:\n   - Follow the given JSON structure with 'value' and 'sub_items'.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-330351.42\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value1\": \"8000000.00\", \"sub_item value2\": \"7669648.58\"}}}\n```",
