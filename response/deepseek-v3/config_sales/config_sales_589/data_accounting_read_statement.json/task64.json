                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand what each part is asking for and then extract the necessary information from the given financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task asks us to identify and extract three specific line items from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under \"Paid-in Capital\" or similar.\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is usually the \"Profit Before Tax\" line in the Income Statement.\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This refers to the increase in \"Accounts Payable\" during the period, which can be found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n\nThe outputs should be grouped by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement.\n\n### Given Financial Statements\n\nWe have three financial statements provided:\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**\n2. **Cash Flow Statement**\n3. **Income Statement**\n\nLet's go through each one to find the required information.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking for \"Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares\":\n- In the Balance Sheet, there's a line item called \"Paid-in Capital\" with an \"End_amount\" of \"13000000.00\" as of \"2024-01-28\".\n  \n  So, `value1 = '13000000.00'`.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nLooking for \"Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense\":\n- In the Income Statement, there's a line item \"Profit Before Tax\" with an \"Amount\" of \"1478526.85\" as of \"2024-01-28\".\n  \n  So, `value2 = '1478526.85'`.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nLooking for \"Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period\":\n- This refers to the increase in \"Accounts Payable\". In the Cash Flow Statement, under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\", the \"Amount\" is \"545000.00\" as of \"2024-01-28\".\n  \n  So, `value3 = '545000.00'`.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example to ensure we're doing this correctly:\n\n- `value1` was \"Paid-in Capital\" from the Balance Sheet: '13000000.00'.\n- `value2` was \"Profit Before Tax\" from the Income Statement: '-1373590.51'.\n- `value3` was \"Increase in Accounts Payable\" from the Cash Flow Statement: '1590000.00'.\n\nThis matches our approach, so we're on the right track.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1478526.85', 'value3': '545000.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**:\n   - Located \"Paid-in Capital\" under the Balance Sheet.\n   - Extracted the \"End_amount\": '13000000.00' → `value1`.\n\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - Located \"Profit Before Tax\" under the Income Statement.\n   - Extracted the \"Amount\": '1478526.85' → `value2`.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - Located \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" under the Cash Flow Statement.\n   - Extracted the \"Amount\": '545000.00' → `value3`.\n\nThus, the final solution is correctly assembled as above.",
