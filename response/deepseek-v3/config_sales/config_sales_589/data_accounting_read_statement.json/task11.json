This line item is typically labeled as \"Retained Earnings\" in the balance sheet.\n\nFrom the provided balance sheet, we can see the following entries for \"Retained Earnings\":\n\n- **Initial_amount**: 0.00 (as of the Initial_date: 2023-12-31)\n- **End_amount**: 1193771.08 (as of the End_date: 2024-01-28)\n\nThese values indicate the initial and final amounts of retained earnings, which represent the cumulative profits or losses retained in the entity over the period.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1193771.08'} }\n```",
