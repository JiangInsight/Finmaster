In the given problem, it is \"Main Business Revenue\" with the value \"5695115.02\".\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is typically the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" line item, which represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company. In the given problem, it is \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with the value \"3085000.00\".\n\nThe order of the values in the solution should match the order of the line items as they appear in the income statement. \n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n- First, locate \"Main Business Revenue\" in the income statement and note its value: \"5695115.02\".\n- Next, locate \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the income statement and note its value: \"3085000.00\".\n- Finally, present these values in the required JSON format, maintaining the original order.\n\nThe solution is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5695115.02', 'value2': '3085000.00'} }\n```",
