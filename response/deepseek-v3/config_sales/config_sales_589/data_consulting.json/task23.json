                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two ratios: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows how much gross profit a company makes from its sales. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   This gives us a percentage that tells us how efficiently a company is producing its goods or services.\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: This ratio measures a company's ability to cover its debts with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   Here, \"Total Debt\" typically refers to the company's total liabilities. A higher ratio means the company is better able to cover its debts with its operating cash flow.\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the provided financial statements, let's extract the necessary figures.\n\n#### Income Statement:\n- **Total Revenue**: 5,695,115.02\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 3,085,000.00\n- **Gross Profit**: 2,610,115.02\n\n#### Cash Flow Statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -224,133.22 (This is negative, which might indicate cash outflow from operations)\n\n#### Balance Sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 829,755.77\n- There doesn't seem to be any long-term liabilities mentioned, so **Total Debt** might just be the current liabilities. However, sometimes \"Total Debt\" can include both current and non-current liabilities. In this case, since only current liabilities are provided, we'll assume Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 829,755.77.\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,610,115.02}{5,695,115.02} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2,610,115.02}{5,695,115.02} \\approx 0.4583\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.4583 \\times 100 \\approx 45.83\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **45.83%**.\n\n### Calculating Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-224,133.22}{829,755.77}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-224,133.22}{829,755.77} \\approx -0.270\n\\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-0.27**.\n\n### Verifying Total Debt\n\nWait a minute—I assumed that Total Debt is equal to Total Current Liabilities because no long-term liabilities are listed. But is this accurate? \n\nLooking back at the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 829,755.77\n- There's no mention of long-term liabilities (like long-term loans, bonds payable, etc.), so it seems the company doesn't have any long-term debt. \n\nTherefore, Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 829,755.77 seems correct.\n\n### Finalizing the Ratios\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin**: 45.83%\n- **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: -0.27\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio was presented without a percentage sign and as a decimal to two places. So, we might present it as '-0.27'. Similarly, the Gross Profit Margin was given with two decimal places in the example ('18.80%'), so we'll present ours as '45.83%'.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '45.83%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.27'}}\n```\n\n### Double-Checking Calculations\n\nLet me quickly verify the calculations to ensure no mistakes.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit = 2,610,115.02\n   - Total Revenue = 5,695,115.02\n   - 2,610,115.02 / 5,695,115.02 ≈ 0.4583 → 45.83% ✔\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -224,133.22\n   - Total Debt (Current Liabilities) = 829,755.77\n   - -224,133.22 / 829,755.77 ≈ -0.270 → -0.27 ✔\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Additional Consideration\n\nOne thing to note is that the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is negative here, which is unusual because it implies that the company's operating activities are consuming cash rather than generating it. This could be a sign of financial stress, especially if this is a recurring situation. \n\nIn the given data, the negative cash flow from operations is primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and inventory, which are uses of cash, despite the company being profitable (Net Profit is positive at 1,193,771.08). This discrepancy between profit and cash flow is often due to non-cash expenses (like depreciation) and changes in working capital.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully calculating and verifying, the final ratios are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '45.83%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.27'}}\n```",
