                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Gross Profit Margin and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods and services. The formula is:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**: This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It's an indicator of short-term liquidity. The formula is:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n- Total Revenue: \\$5,695,115.02\n- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): \\$3,085,000.00\n- Gross Profit: \\$2,610,115.02\n\nFrom the **cash flow statement**:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$224,133.22\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n- Total Current Liabilities: \\$829,755.77\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nLet's plug the numbers into the Gross Profit Margin formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,610,115.02}{5,695,115.02} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nCalculating the division first:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2,610,115.02}{5,695,115.02} \\approx 0.4583\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.4583 \\times 100 \\approx 45.83\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **45.83%**.\n\n### Calculating Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nNow, let's calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-224,133.22}{829,755.77}\n\\]\n\nPerforming the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-224,133.22}{829,755.77} \\approx -0.270\n\\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately **-0.27**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit: \\$2,610,115.02\n   - Total Revenue: \\$5,695,115.02\n   - \\$2,610,115.02 / \\$5,695,115.02 ≈ 0.4583 → 45.83%\n   - This seems correct.\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$224,133.22\n   - Total Current Liabilities: \\$829,755.77\n   - -\\$224,133.22 / \\$829,755.77 ≈ -0.27\n   - This also seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating both ratios, here's the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '45.83%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.27'} }\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin (45.83%)**: This is a healthy margin, indicating that the company retains a good portion of revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold. It suggests efficient production or strong pricing power.\n  \n- **Operating Cash Flow Ratio (-0.27)**: A negative ratio indicates that the company's operating cash flow is insufficient to cover its current liabilities. This could be a sign of liquidity issues, meaning the company might struggle to meet its short-term obligations with the cash generated from operations. It's important to investigate why the operating cash flow is negative—perhaps due to significant increases in accounts receivable or inventory, as seen in the cash flow statement.\n\nUnderstanding these ratios helps in assessing the company's profitability and liquidity positions, which are crucial for financial health analysis.",
