                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one using the provided financial statements. I'll go through each calculation step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -224,133.22\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 829,755.77\n\n**Calculation:**  \n-224,133.22 / 829,755.77 ≈ -0.27\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 829,755.77 (since there are no non-current liabilities listed)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,193,771.08\n\n**Calculation:**  \n829,755.77 / 14,193,771.08 ≈ 0.058\n\nWait a minute, the initial example had a Debt to Equity Ratio of 0.16, which seems higher. Maybe I'm missing something. \n\nLooking back at the balance sheet, the only liabilities are current liabilities (Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable summing to 829,755.77). There's no long-term debt mentioned. So, total debt is just current liabilities here.\n\nThus, Debt to Equity Ratio = 829,755.77 / 14,193,771.08 ≈ 0.058 or 0.06 when rounded.\n\nBut the example seems to include only current liabilities in debt, so maybe it's correct as is.\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 5,695,115.02\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets = 15,023,526.85\n- Average Total Assets = (13,000,000 + 15,023,526.85) / 2 = 14,011,763.425\n\n**Calculation:**  \n5,695,115.02 / 14,011,763.425 ≈ 0.41\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 9,963,057.95\n- Inventory = 720,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 829,755.77\n\n**Calculation:**  \n(9,963,057.95 - 720,000) / 829,755.77 = 9,243,057.95 / 829,755.77 ≈ 11.14\n\nWait, that seems very high. Let me check the components of current assets:\n\nCurrent Assets:\n- Cash on Hand: 3,730,866.78\n- Bank Deposits: 3,938,781.80\n- Interest Receivable: 10,811.11\n- Accounts Receivable: 1,562,598.26\n- Inventory: 720,000.00\nTotal: 9,963,057.95\n\nQuick Assets (excluding inventory):\n3,730,866.78 + 3,938,781.80 + 10,811.11 + 1,562,598.26 = 9,243,057.95\n\nQuick Ratio = 9,243,057.95 / 829,755.77 ≈ 11.14\n\nThis seems unusually high; perhaps the inventory is already excluded in the given \"Total Current Assets,\" but looking at the breakdown, it's included. Maybe the company has a lot of liquid assets compared to liabilities.\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio, which we calculated as -0.27.\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Income / Average Shareholder's Equity\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1,193,771.08\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Owner's Equity = 13,000,000.00\n- End Owner's Equity = 14,193,771.08\n- Average Equity = (13,000,000 + 14,193,771.08) / 2 = 13,596,885.54\n\n**Calculation:**  \n1,193,771.08 / 13,596,885.54 ≈ 0.0878 or 8.78%\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since no cash sales are specified):\n- Net Sales = 5,695,115.02\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00\n- End Accounts Receivable = 1,562,598.26\n- Average AR = (0 + 1,562,598.26) / 2 = 781,299.13\n\n**Calculation:**  \n5,695,115.02 / 781,299.13 ≈ 7.29\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter recalculating and verifying each ratio, here's the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.27', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.41', 'Quick Ratio': '11.14', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.27', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '8.78%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.29'}}\n```\n\nHowever, some ratios seem unusually high (like Quick Ratio). Let me double-check the Quick Ratio components:\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable  \n= 3,730,866.78 + 3,938,781.80 + 10,811.11 + 1,562,598.26 = 9,243,057.95  \nCurrent Liabilities = 829,755.77  \nQuick Ratio = 9,243,057.95 / 829,755.77 ≈ 11.14\n\nThis seems correct based on the data. The company has a very high amount of liquid assets compared to its current liabilities, leading to a high quick ratio.\n\nSimilarly, the Debt to Equity Ratio is low because the company has minimal debt (only current liabilities) relative to a large equity base.\n\nThe Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities and Operating Cash Flow Ratio are the same, both negative, indicating that operating cash flow is negative relative to current liabilities.\n\nTotal Asset Turnover is 0.41, meaning the company generates $0.41 in sales for every $1 of assets.\n\nROE is 8.78%, showing the return generated on shareholders' equity.\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover is 7.29, indicating how many times receivables are collected during the period.\n\nThus, the final answer stands as above.",
